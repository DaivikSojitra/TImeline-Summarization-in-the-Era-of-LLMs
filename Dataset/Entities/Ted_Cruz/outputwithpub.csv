2013-01-19,"When the firebrand Republican senator Ted Cruz went on conservative Laura Ingraham 's radio show last week , the topic of conversation swiftly turned to Barack Obama .
As the president prepares to be inaugurated on Monday for a second term , Cruz , who is a Tea Party favourite freshly elected from Texas , let loose with both barrels . ""
He is feeling right now high on his own power ! ""
Cruz fumed .
Cruz was particularly angry about Obama 's plan to try to enforce tighter gun controls .
But the president appears to be preparing a whole series of reforms that will raise the ire of the right .
He has vowed action on immigration , hinted that he will try to tackle climate change , and has already taken a much tougher line with Republicans on fiscal issues , forcing them to agree to a tax rise for the wealthy .
For many it seems that Obama has been reinvigorated by his victory over Mitt Romney and might be in a position to win back a liberal base disappointed by a first term that many saw as timid , overly concerned with Republican co - operation and â€ “ most important â€ “ hamstrung by the needs of dealing with the Great Recession . ""
Maybe we now get to see what Obama would have been like if there had been no financial crisis , "" said Professor Shaun Bowler , a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside .
The political ground that Obama is standing on as he maps out strategy for the next four years certainly looks fertile .
He ended up beating Romney easily , seeing off a challenger whom many thought was the Republican party 's strongest candidate , albeit in a weak field .
But Obama is likely to strike quickly as the honeymoon period for second terms usually lasts little longer than a year before electoral considerations of the 2014 mid - term elections loom into view .
Indeed , he has already done so .
After being widely criticised in his first four years for a lack of savvy during negotiations with the Republican - controlled House of Representatives , Obama has suddenly taken a much harder line .
In debates over the so - called "" fiscal cliff "" of tax hikes and spending cuts at the end of last year , Obama 's team secured a deal widely seen as a victory .
That tougher stance has also been matched by Obama staking out a strong position on forthcoming talks with the Republicans in Congress over raising the debt ceiling .
Indeed , only days after Obama gave a speech on the issue marked by stern language the Republicans last week appeared to cave in and moved to extend the ceiling for another three months .
It marks an apparent shift in Obama 's view of the presidency , from one where he has to act as a conciliator to one where he can lead from the front . ""
He has made noises that he is going to give up his old theory of the presidency and he is going to now use it as a ' bully pulpit ' , "" said Professor James Josefson , a political scientist at Bridgewater College in Virginia .
The change has also won Obama praise from party supporters and advisers . ""
He will decide what he wants to do and he will just do it .
He 's going to push ahead , "" said Ted Kaufman , a former Democratic senator from Delaware who was Vice - President Joe Biden 's chief of staff for 19 years .
But as Obama finds himself at the head of a relatively unified Democratic party he is staring at a Republican party in disarray and riven by civil war .
Its conservative wing , still infused by the Tea Party , believes Romney lost because the party was not rightwing enough .
But a powerful cohort of more moderate leaders , such as Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and New Jersey governor Chris Christie , want to broaden its appeal .
They see the party as having lost five out of the last six popular votes at a presidential level and staring at a future where Democrat - friendly minorities , especially Hispanic voters , are getting ever more powerful at the ballot box .
That has seen the party indulge in rare outbursts of public bickering .
Christie slammed House speaker John Boehner over delays to aid in the wake of Hurricane Sandy that devastated his home state .
Jindal has even warned that Republicans need to "" stop being the stupid party "" .
The fight has reversed the usual dynamic of American politics â€ “ where Democrats are seen as fractious and Republicans disciplined â€ “ and raised hopes that Obama might actually extend his power in the 2014 mid - terms , which would usually be a tricky election to face .
At the moment Obama 's approval ratings are at a healthy 55 % , compared with an anaemic 24 % for House Republicans .
But it is not all good news for Obama and the Democrats .
America 's political system is defined by checks and balances between competing institutions , and Republican control of the House still acts as a major check on his ambitions .
Though many experts believe the Republicans may have to give ground on an issue like immigration reform , other policy areas â€ “ such as gun controls and limiting the social impact of spending cuts â€ “ might still end up scuppered .
"" It still depends on how co - operative the Republicans are going to be , and for most of them Obama is just thought of as appalling , no matter what he does or says , "" said Bowler .
Republicans may be able to block a great deal of Obama 's second - term agenda but on a host of things â€ “ from gun controls to gay rights to abortion and women 's issues â€ “ they are frequently seen as far to the right of mainstream public opinion .
"" Obama is either going to win on these issues legislatively or he is going to win on them in the arena of public opinion .
He is going to have a year of success ahead of him either way , even if it ends up being just as much appearances as substance , "" Bowler said .
That is a remarkable turnaround for Obama .
It is only four short months since the president gave a disastrous performance during his first debate with Romney , causing the Republican to spike in the polls and suddenly look like he might win .
Right up until election night itself last November many Republicans , including Romney himself , who wrote no concession speech , and a few nervous Democrats believed they could be witnessing the return of a Republican to the White House .
Now , as Obama plots out a second term aimed at cementing his legacy , those doubts and fears feel a long time ago . ""
He has been freed by the fact that the American people seem to be on his side , "" Kaufman said .
What the voices say on the left and right Heather Hurlburt Executive director , National Security Network , focusing on foreign policy ; speechwriter for President Clinton Obama 's first term foreign policy was spent working to clear away the debris of what had come before : Iraq , Afghanistan , torture , but also the threat of global economic meltdown and an Arab world hangover more than 30 years in the making .
In his second term , he now has the opportunity to reshape the model and direction of America 's outreach to the world for the next 10 years or more .
Here are longer - term priority areas : Clarity and oversight on counterterrorism : setting clear limits and public oversight on where the US goes to war , and how , particularly around targeted killings and the use of remote or cyber - warfare tools , he can constrain his successors , set global norms and increase the effectiveness of a counter - terrorism agenda .
Economic statecraft : Hillary Clinton 's signature initiative , reasserting the importance and breadth of economic diplomacy , must outlast her tenure .
Efforts overseas will have to be matched by budget realignments at home , to make economic and trade diplomacy as empowered as the military - first approaches of the previous decade .
Pursue the promise of Prague : Obama can not count on much help from Moscow or Tehran or even the US Congress in reducing the role of nuclear weapons in US security policy .
But there are steps he can take alone : accelerating US reductions under the New Start [ arms limitation ] treaty , reconsidering and reducing the number of warheads demanded by US nuclear targeting policy , making further cuts without waiting for Moscow .

Any ideas that I , or any other Republican might have , would never be listened to by Obama .
I do n't have the time or inclination to think about what he should take a chance on doing .
Obama 's rhetoric and actions today are diametrically opposed to the ideals on which he ran in 2008 .
Whether on the fiscal cliff , budget deficit , guns , or any other issue , he seems gleeful in his desire to bludgeon his Republican opponents and win every contest by 100 - 0 .
The fact that he has four more years to do some of the things I think he may do is quite disconcerting to me .
My hope is that he follows the Hippocratic Oath and "" does no [ more ] harm . ""
Jim Dean Chair , Democracy for America President Obama should stay in touch with his inner Teddy Roosevelt and continue to lead with the same strong conviction he is displaying regarding gun safety .
Americans favour strong leadership , even if they do not always agree with the substance of a leader 's position .
If the recent elections proved anything , they proved that the country is continuing to move beyond the discourse in Washington that is too often fuelled more by money and less by public support .
In the case of gun safety , most of the public , and even NRA members , support the President .
It is time for him to lead the public rather than hope for acquiescence .
The people have overwhelming elected Obama , not once but twice â€ “ now he must use that position to get things done , and not shy away from a fight .
Larry Haas Political commentator and former aide in Clinton White House
In the Middle East , Asia , Africa , and elsewhere , dissidents are struggling to bring freedom and democracy to their nations , but the autocrats in power are finding harsher , more creative ways to crack down on them .
Traditionally , the US has led global efforts to advance freedom and democracy around the world and US support has proven important to the important gains of recent decades .
To date , however , Obama has provided only lukewarm support for the cause .
With his last election behind him , Obama should shift course and more forcefully put the US behind the brave democratic activists , labour leaders , journalists and others who are putting their lives on the line every day .
Bolder U.S. support for the cause will make it more likely that the dissidents and their movements will succeed .
That , in turn , will make the world a safer and more prosperous place from which the United States and every other nation can benefit . ""
Meghan Clyne Special assistant and speechwriter to President George W Bush and first lady Laura Bush Obama should start by eliminating the danger to religious liberty posed by Obamacare .
Under the law , most employers are required to pay for female employees ' sterilisations and contraceptives , including some drugs that can destroy fertilised embryos .
This presents many religious employers , both institutions and individuals , with an impossible choice : violate their religious beliefs , or close down .
Obama needed women 's votes last year , and forcing religious employers to provide birth control was good politics .
But the election is over , and the consequences of the "" HHS mandate , "" as the requirement is known , are starting to be felt .
Obama can fix the problem himself by ordering health and human services secretary Kathleen Sebelius to rewrite the rule and exempt any employer who objects to the mandate for religious reasons .
Melissa McEwan Writer and founder of the progressive blog
Shakesville I would love to see President Obama take a more active role in defining the national conversation on reproductive rights , with an uncompromising position in favour of choice .
During his first term , a record number of pieces of anti - choice legislation were proposed and passed in state legislatures and our pro - choice president must use his bully pulpit to give visibility to the war on agency being waged across the nation .
I was deeply moved by the president 's affirmation of his support for marriage equality , which was followed by an increase in national support for same - sex marriage .
I hope , in his second term , we may see a similarly influential advocacy on behalf of choice .
He can not intervene in state legislatures to stop assaults on reproductive rights , but he can be a vocal ally .

2013-05-10,"The scale of the revolution in Republican thinking required to pass comprehensive immigration reform was laid bare in a bumpy first day of debate of a supposedly bipartisan bill in the Senate .
All six Republicans on the judiciary committee who are not directly sponsoring the bill voted in favour of amendments on Thursday that would significantly delay legalising 11 million undocumented migrants in the US .
Conservatives such as Texan Ted Cruz clashed with the committee 's Democrat majority , who accused them of trying to scupper reform entirely .
Immigration experts anticipate that anxiety among Republicans will only intensify as momentum passes to the more conservative House of Represenatives , but predict electoral self - interest among the leadership may yet carry it through .
"" It is a delicate dance , "" said Ted Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations .
"" When you move through to the House there are a higher percentage in the Cruz camp , but you do n't need a majority of the Republicans to do this if the leadership is looking to let it through . ""
Following their defeat in the 2012 election , Republican leaders concluded they needed to back immigration reform to win over the growing number of Latino voters who secured President Obama 's second term .
Senior figures with presidential ambitions in 2016 such as congressman Paul Ryan , and senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio , have already spoken out in favour of the bill .
Alden said House speaker John Boehner was "" playing his cards closer to his chest "" but predicted he would be willing to let the bill pass with a minority of Republicans voting alongside Democrats if presidential hopefuls kept up their pressure .
During the debate on Thursday , a number of Republicans attempted to delay the implementation of an amnesty - like provision until authorities could prove they had fully secured the southern border with Mexico against further illegal entry .
Though defeated by Democrats , who form a majority on the Senate judiciary committee , the Republicans warned the issue would become a sticking point in the House of Representatives .
"" If we do n't have real border security , in my view this bill will not pass , "" said Cruz .
This prompted an angry response from the bill 's sponsors who accused opponents of using border security as an excuse to block any immigration reform . ""
The real reason [ he wants this ] is : Senator Cruz is opposed to a path to citizenship , "" said New York Democrat Chuck Schumer .
"" Let 's not keep bringing up this false issue of border security .
Our bill is tough as nails on border security , but what it does not do is deny 11 million people a path to citizenship . ""
Committee chairman Patrick Leahy later attempted to paper over the cracks in the consensus , pointing out that the committee had adopted 21 of the 32 amendments offered on Thursday â€ “ almost all with some degree of bipartisan agreement â€ “ but battle lines have been drawn .
Earlier , a third of the members of the judiciary committee voted for two amendments that would delay US immigration reform at its first hurdle , suggesting the bill may face a bumpier ride through Congress than its bipartisan backers had hoped .
The first amendment , proposed by the Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley , would have required the government to show it had "" fully secured "" the border with Mexico for six months before allowing the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants who are already in the US to begin applying for legal status .
Currently , the bill proposes allowing the process to begin as long as the government comes up with a plan to tighten border security further .
Though defeated , the attempt to delay the process was supported by five other Republicans on the judiciary committee , which is considering amendments in the first stage of a legislative process that is likely to last until at least July .
Only Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Arizona 's Jeff Flake , both members of the "" gang of eight "" who proposed the bill last month , voted against their fellow Republicans .
Although a Democrat majority on the Senate committee ensures the mark - p process should proceed without any major opposition measure passing , the initial session on Thursday undermined suggestions that there is broad bipartisan support for the immigration reform bill .
Some among the gang of eight had hoped for a majority of at least 70 in the full Senate as a show of strength that would give the bill momentum to pass through the Republican - controlled House .
Grassley said : "" The bill will struggle to pass the House unless the border security problem is fixed . ""
He argued that US public opinion was against anything that would add millions of new legal competitors for jobs without first guaranteeing that no more illegal immigrants would arrive .
The committee debate also heard colourful language from the Texas Republican John Cornyn , who said there were also national security concerns â€ “ as some of those coming across the Mexican border were "" wearing turbans "" .
Graham suggested that many of those crossing from Mexico and other countries were doing so because where they came from was a "" hell hole "" .
Schumer , one of the key backers of reform , warned that any amendment requiring full border security compliance could fatally undermine the legislation .
"" It would mean if one radar is broken then nobody who is already here could get legal status , "" he said .
"" It would probably delay for ever anything to bring these people out of the shadows . ""
Another Grassley amendment , proposing that Congress rather than the government should determine whether border security was adequate before implementing the bill , saw a similar six v 12 rebellion from Republicans ."
2013-07-14,"A freshman senator 's summer travel plans have sparked increased speculation that he could mount a bid for the US presidency in 2016 .
Ted Cruz , a Republican from Texas , is scheduled to headline a fundraiser for the party in New Hampshire on August 23 , according to the Associated Press .
The trip will be the 42-year - old 's first visit to the state .
New Hampshire traditionally holds the first primary , guaranteeing a huge level of media attention and making it an important testing ground and momentum generator for candidates .
Cruz also intends to travel to Iowa and Florida and has visited South Carolina : three states that held early votes in the 2012 cycle .
He only took office in January but has swiftly risen to prominence and become popular with the Tea Party for his views and energetic , confrontational style , which has upset some within the Republican establishment .
Cruz was born in Canada , but this is unlikely to disqualify him from the requirement that the president be a "" natural - born citizen "" , since his mother is from Delaware , qualifying him from birth as an American citizen .
A survey of the Republican race in Iowa â€ “ home of the first caucus â€ “ put Cruz in sixth , with 10 % of the vote .
And Cruz could face competition from within Texas in the form of Rick Perry , who failed to win the Republican nomination in 2012 .
Perry said last Monday that he will not seek re - election as Texas governor next year , leaving him free to mount a fresh bid for the White House without distractions .
He was coy when asked about his future on CNN on Sunday , saying his focus is on his final 18 months as governor .
Meanwhile , Perry defended Texas 's controversial abortion bill , which passed through the senate in Austin on Friday but is set to be challenged in the federal courts .
He rejected a claim from Wendy Davis , a state senator who has become an icon of the pro - choice movement , that the law will harm health by forcing the closure of the vast majority of the state 's abortion clinics , prompting women to seek illegal alternatives .
"" I do n't agree with her premise and I do n't agree with her numbers , I think history will prove that she 's wrong by asserting that , "" Perry said on CNN . ""
Should the state be able to make these decisions or should we allow this big cumbersome federal government decide for all of us ? ""
Perry 's unyielding anti - abortion stance amid the national coverage generated by the bill might enhance his reputation among rightwingers , an analyst told the Guardian . ""
Rick Perry has perfected the art of speaking directly to a conservative audience and using the negative response of his opponents and the news media to his advantage , "" said James Henson , director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin .
"" What sounds like bluster and posturing to one audience sounds like heroic truth - telling to another .
Whether he ultimately gets in that race or not remains an open question , but it certainly does n't hurt that effort . ""
The favourite to replace Perry , Texas attorney general Greg Abbott , was expected to announce his candidacy at an event in San Antonio Sunday afternoon .
The 55-year - old Republican reportedly has a $ 23 m campaign warchest .
Abbott also has an ally in Cruz , who worked under him as Texas solicitor general .
Like Perry and Cruz , Abbott has regularly adopted strongly conservative positions on issues such as gun control , abortion and limiting the powers of the federal government .
Straight after the supreme court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act last month , Abbott announced that Texas ' voter ID law and a re - drawing of the state 's electoral boundaries would go into immediate effect .
Before last year 's presidential election , Abbott threatened international elections observers at Texas polling stations with arrest .
Asked in February what his job entails , he said : "" I go into the office in the morning , I sue Barack Obama , and then I go home . """
2013-08-20,"Senator Ted Cruz has in his possession a list of two countries that he personally is a citizen of .
Hang on , he 's â€ ¦
he 's taking out the list
and he 's â€
¦ it appears he 's striking one of the entries .
Make that one .
Ted Cruz has in his hand a list of one country he is a citizen of .
It 's America .
Not North America â€ “ America America .
In an irony - saturated political episode that unfolded late Monday , Cruz , a staunch opponent of immigration reform known for talking a bunch of ooga - booga about "" foreign nationals , "" turns out , apparently , to be a dual citizen of the USA and Canada .
Dual citizen â€ “ great thing .
Unless you happen to be a nationalist demagogue senator from Texas presenting yourself as a maybe - presidential nominee from the Republican party , in which case â€ “ embarrassing .
Wrapping yourself in the American flag is n't as convincing when you 're wearing Maple Leaf underwear .
Cruz was born in Canada to a mother from the USA and a Cuban father .
News of his possible dual citizenship â€ “ again , a more innocuous thing than which it is difficult to think of , especially when the other country is Canada â€ “ spurred the candidate to declare late Monday that he would take the ultimate step and renounce his mountie patrimony .
For good measure Cruz provided his birth certificate to the Dallas Morning News , the newspaper that reported his bi - nationality .
It quoted an expert on Canadian law , who said Cruz 's birth in Canada means "" he 's a Canadian . ""
"" Now the Dallas Morning News says that I may technically have dual citizenship , "" Cruz said in a statement late Monday . ""
Assuming that is true , then , sure , I will renounce any Canadian citizenship .
Nothing against Canada , but I 'm an American by birth , and as a US senator , I believe I should be only an American . ""
As he is a potential contender for the presidency , the question of Cruz 's nationality had already arisen .
The US constitution says presidents must be "" natural - born . ""
Apparently there 's some legal argument that being born in Canada to a USA mother does n't make you natural - born .
That argument is extremely thin .
Questioning the citizenship status of presidential candidates without heed of fact or sense is an honored tradition in American politics .
This latest edition is more of the same .
Here 's hoping US voters give Cruz a pass on his Canadian citizenship .
As long he gets it cleaned up right quick ."
2013-09-23,"Republican senator Ted Cruz blamed Democrats on Monday for provoking an imminent government shutdown , claiming majority leader Harry Reid was "" using the threat of default to force Obamacare on the American people "" .
Setting conventional Washington wisdom on its head , Cruz tried to reverse responsibility for the latest budget stand - off in the hope of garnering support from moderate Republicans and limiting growing public anger toward his party .
The latest twist to the increasingly - surreal Congressional blame game came as Cruz was prevented from resorting to procedural measures that would have frustrated a Democratic plan to "" clean up "" the bill and take out the threat to President Obama 's flagship healthcare reform .
The original combined bill , passed by the House of Representatives on Friday , is widely seen as a last - ditch Republican effort to block the Affordable Care Act before it is implemented next month by holding government finances to ransom .
But Cruz argued the opposite on Monday , insisting that Senate Democrats were passing up an opportunity to prevent a government shutdown by not simply voting for the House bill in its current form . ""
No American wants a government shut down .
I do n't want a government shutdown and no one in this party does , "" said Cruz .
"" Five minutes ago the Senate could have acted to prevent a government shutdown .
We could have avoided the spectre and the countdown clock would disappear but [ majority leader Reid ] would rather risk a government shutdown because he supports a law called Obamacare . ""
Senate Democrats hope to strip the healthcare threat out of the funding bill before sending the "" clean "" version back to the House of Representatives in the hours leading up to next Monday 's budget deadline .
But the rhetorical blame game matters because Cruz is hoping to persuade moderate Republicans in the Senate to block any vote at all until the Democrats agree to negotiations over healthcare .
By portraying a shutdown as the fault of Democrats , Cruz hopes he can remove the stigma of a no vote for moderate Republicans who are wary of being blamed in the long run and reluctant to block passage of the current House bill just for tactical purposes in the short - run .
Cruz and conservatives in the House have vowed to repeal Obamacare using all methods at their disposal because they fear that creeping government control of healthcare is bad for patients and the economy . ""
Three years ago this body passed Obamacare in a straightline vote and in the time since , Americans have learned that it 's not working , "" said the Texan senator .
"" It 's the single biggest job - killer in America . ""
Harry Reid defended his decision to prevent Cruz from using a 60-vote threshold to block efforts to strip out the healthcare amendment .
"" Most of us think the Senate has enough 60 vote hurdles as it is .
We do n't want to add any more barriers , "" he told Cruz in the Senate debate on Monday afternoon .
"" The American people are really fed up and I would bet that most Americans would rather we avoid shutting down the government . ""
Reid 's tactics mean that Senate Republicans will now either have to block progress of the bill entirely or allow it be amended with a simple 50-vote majority and passed back to the House without the healthcare threat attached ."
2013-09-24,"Texan Republican Ted Cruz launched a marathon speech on the floor of the US Senate on Wednesday in a theatrical effort to draw attention to his flagging attempt to block Obama 's healthcare reforms .
Though no longer able to delay proceedings significantly with a formal filibuster , Cruz began speaking out against Obamacare at 2.40pm and vowed to keep going until he was "" no longer able to stand "" .
Hours beforehand , the first - term conservative senator was thwarted in his effort to link Obamacare to a wider federal budget resolution , significantly reducing the threat of a government shutdown next week .
Republican Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn refused to back a Cruz plan to block the resolution , opening the way for Democrat majority leader Harry Reid to schedule the first in a series of procedural votes starting on Wednesday afternoon .
But Cruz took to the floor nonetheless , with periodic support from fellow Republicans Mike Lee and David Vitter , to rail against Obamacare and a Senate process which he compared to a "" rigged wrestling contest "" .
Showing signs of continuing well into the night , Cruz 's pseudo - filibuster deployed the colourful rhetoric that have made him a 2016 presidential favourite among Tea Party conservatives .
"" We need to make DC listen , "" he said .
"" Make them listen to the single mom working in the diner , struggling to feed her kids who has just been told she has to take a cut in hours due to Obamacare . ""
Invoking the Second world war , civil war , war of independence and space race in his favour , Cruz rarely skipped a beat as the afternoon wore on .
But Senate majority leader Reid was adamant that Cruz would not be allowed to frustrate passage of the bill any further .
"" I want to make sure everyone understands : There is no filibuster today , "" declared Reid at the outset of Tuesday 's session .
Cruz also appeared to acknowledge that he had lost Republican support in the Senate , complaining that lawmakers on both sides were preparing to give away their filibuster rights by allowing Democrats to hold a simple majority vote on future amendments .
"" Our leaders , in both parties , are asking us to vote on a bill without knowing what is in it , "" he said .
Reid will bring a so - called ' motion to proceed ' vote on Wednesday followed by a ' cloture ' vote to end debate on Friday or Saturday .
This requires 60 votes to pass , but without the support of their party leadership , Cruz and Lee are unlikely to stop it going through .
After that , Reid is free to introduce an amendment on Sunday to the original budget resolution which strips out the threat to defund Obamacare and only requires 51 votes to pass .
This would mean a so - called "" clean "" budget resolution will be sent back to the House on Monday with only hours to go until the government funding authorisation expires .
Republicans may still choose to force a government shut down at this point , but speaker John Boehner is increasingly expected to allow a vote that would pass the budget resolution with help from Democrats and a minority of House Republicans ."
2013-09-25,"Shortly before Alabama Governor George Wallace took office in 1963 his attorney general , Richmond Flowers , warned him of the pointlessness of facing down the federal government over integration : Look George , you gon na be whupped all through the courts .
And when you 're whupped in the courts , the Klan 's gon na come out on the streets and the killing 's gon na start .
You know what 's gon na happen .
Wallace knew Flowers was right .
He just did n't care .
His currency with his constituency did not come from winning , or even fighting , per se .
His aim was to perform resistance in such a manner that nobody could say he had n't tried â€ “ even if he had no chance of winning .
Damnit , send the Justice Department word , I ai n't compromising with anybody .
I 'm gon na make 'em bring troops to this state .
And so he did , standing in the schoolhouse door in Tuscaloosa at the University of Alabama , bloviating about states ' rights before stepping aside as President Kennedy federalised the national guard and White House emissaries made sure the two black students went to their dorms .
As Marshall Frady wrote , in Wallace : It had been little more than a ceremony of futility .
And , as a historical moment , a rather pedestrian production .
But no other southern governor had managed to strike even that dramatic a pose of defiance and it has never been required of southern popular heroes that they be successful .
Indeed , southerners tend to love their heroes more for their losses .
Ted Cruz 's filibuster to prevent the implementation of Obamacare with the threat of shutting down the government has all the hallmarks of the "" noble defeat "" of southern Democrats from the mid - sixties onward .
He is not so much opposing healthcare reform as protesting its inevitability .
Lest there be any confusion , I am not arguing Cruz is in any way a supporter of segregation or admirer of the late Wallace in his darker days .
The comparison relates to his strategy , not his specific intent .
It is in Cruz 's buffoonery , showmanship and tactical disingenuousness that he poses now as Wallace in drag .
It is telling that the record for the longest filibuster in US history up this point goes to the late Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina , who was opposing civil rights legislation .
As Cruz took to the Senate floor Tuesday , vowing to speak "" until I am no longer able to stand "" , it was clear that efforts to block the healthcare reform were fruitless .
The Democrats are the majority in the Senate .
Even the filibuster is pointless because procedures exist that were bound to force Cruz to yield the floor by Wednesday afternoon .
His own GOP colleagues are against him because , like Flowers , they know that , ultimately , he is doing their cause more harm than good .
Sen Orrin Hatch told the Washington Post : We 're in the minority [ in the Senate ] .
We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody , in a way , when we do n't have the votes to do it .
But there stood Cruz , backed by his hardline tea party colleagues , going down in flames and lighting the path towards legislative irrelevancy , while reading Green Eggs and Ham and talking about Ashton Kutcher for as long as his voice and legs would hold .
There is method to this madness .
Given the general trajectory of the Tea Party thus far , losing has far greater political value than winning ever could .
For in defeat , the narrative of the besieged , strident defender of principle against an out - of - touch political class continues .
As Cruz put it : A great many Texans , a great many Americans feel they do not have a voice , and so I hope to play some very small role in providing the voice .
With victory would come responsibility .
He would actually need a plan for what to do about healthcare â€ “ as the senator for a state where 33 % of adults and 17 % of children have no health insurance .
Not for the first time with the Tea Party , there is no plan B. Oppositionist by instinct and obstructionist by intent , their aim , from the debt ceiling to the budget , has always been to block and bluster .
As such , Cruz comes by his intransigence honestly .
As with Wallace , one might even argue that even if it makes no sense legislatively , it does makes sense for him politically .
Cruz has eyes on the 2016 presidential race when he will be standing in a party in which , according to a recent Gallup poll , people are evenly split on whether compromise is a good thing .
Cruz will be seeking support from the wing of his party ( the Tea Party ) that is far more likely to champion the notion that a politician should "" stick to his beliefs "" , than average Republicans are .
Cruz did n't come to the Senate to legislate â€ “ which demands compromise â€ “ but to perform .
Now , he 's turning Congress into his circus ."
2013-09-25,"Texan Republican Ted Cruz talked through the night in a marathon speech against Obamacare , in a show of congressional theatrics devoid anything other than symbolic consequence .
Reading from children 's books to keep going , a tired - looking Cruz was joined in shifts by fellow conservatives Marco Rubio , Rand Paul and Pat Roberts in a stand against Barack Obama 's plan to extend health insurance in the US .
Cruz 's speech was not technically a filibuster , as it he was merely speaking during a permitted time slot .
Nevertheless he gave one of the longest Senate performances ever , stopping after 21 hours 19 minutes , with occasional remarks by other conservative senators .
The speech was ostensibly intended to hold up the passage of what is known as a continuing resolution : a motion to maintain funding for the federal government .
The resolution passed the House of Representatives on Friday , but is the subject of controversy because Republicans tacked on a provision that would defund the non - mandatory elements of the Affordable Care Act .
But there was never a chance that the resolution would be delayed : Cruz always knew that he would have to give way to a procedural vote .
Indeed , after sitting down , he joined every other senator in allowing debate on the resolution to continue .
Some Republicans have disavowed Cruz 's tactics .
A number are fearful that they will be blamed for the consequences of a government shutdown and , others complain of the difficulty of explaining Cruz 's position : attempting to block a measure that he supports .
But Cruz 's tactics did at least ensure proceedings went at the slowest possible pace .
If his pseudo - filibuster had lasted until 3 pm Wednesday , Cruz would have broken the record for the longest - ever Senate speech set by Strom Thurmond in 1957 in an attempt to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act .
Cruz began speaking out against Obamacare at 2.40pm on Tuesday and vowed to keep going until he was "" no longer able to stand "" .
Republican leaders , who have disavowed Cruz and his fellow hardliners , had hoped that they might be able to ensure a swift Senate vote so that they had time to avoid a government shutdown when the legislation is passed back to the House of Representatives for a final showdown before Monday night 's deadline .
But Cruz has dismissed this as defeatism and is calling for Senate Republicans to block passage of the whole budget bill when they vote on Friday or Saturday so as to stop Democrats from stripping out language that would defund Obamacare .
Comparing the Senate procedures to a "" rigged wrestling contest "" , he declared : "" Most Americans could not give a flying flip about a bunch of politicians in Washington .
Who cares ?
Almost all of us are in cheap suits with bad haircuts !
Who cares ? ""
Cruz 's own suit remained unruffled throughout , although at one stage Kansas senator Pat Roberts appeared with his tie hanging at half mast .
The Texan first - term senator also revealed that he had swapped his usual ostrich - skin "" argument boots "" for a pair of black tennis shoes after taking advice from Rand Paul , who staged a shorter filibuster last year against US drone strikes .
Invoking the second world war , civil war , war of independence and space race in his favour , Cruz rarely skipped a beat as the night wore on , but his eyelids were visibly drooping by dawn .
At an early stage , he read the Dr Seuss children 's classic Green Eggs and Ham , which he billed as a bedtime story to his daughters .
While the tactic had charm , some commentators pointed out that the book may not have been the best choice : "" The narrator keeps insisting that he hates green eggs and ham , but he 's never had green eggs and ham , "" wrote Matt Iglesias at Slate .
"" When he finally tries them â€ “ he likes them !
The Democrats ' bet on the Affordable Care Act is that it 's like green eggs and ham â€
“ they 're convinced the public will like it when they try it .
Nevertheless , Cruz ploughed on .
Citing sources as varied as actor Ashton Kutcher and the Denny 's restaurant chain , he also deployed the fiery rhetoric that has made him a 2016 presidential favourite among Tea Party conservatives .
"" We need to make DC listen , "" he said .
"" Make them listen to the single mom working in the diner , struggling to feed her kids who has just been told she has to take a cut in hours due to Obamacare . ""
Cruz took breaks of up to an hour while yielding to questions from supportive Republicans but was also challenged by Democrat Tim Kaine who defended Obama 's plan to extend health insurance to low - wage Americans .
At one stage , senator Marco Rubio recited a story about Venezuelan toilet paper factories .
Hours before the speech started , Republican Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn refused to back a Cruz plan to block the resolution , opening the way for Democrat majority leader Harry Reid to schedule the first in a series of procedural votes starting on Wednesday afternoon . ""
Senator McConnell supports the House Republicans ' bill and will not vote to block it , since it defunds Obamacare and funds the government without increasing spending by a penny , "" a spokesman for McConnell said in a statement .
Senate majority leader Reid was also adamant that Cruz would not be allowed to frustrate passage of the bill any further .
"" I want to make sure everyone understands : There is no filibuster today , "" declared Reid at the outset of Tuesday 's session .
Cruz also appeared to acknowledge that he had lost Republican support in the Senate , complaining that lawmakers on both sides were preparing to give away their filibuster rights by allowing Democrats to hold a simple majority vote on future amendments .
"" Our leaders , in both parties , are asking us to vote on a bill without knowing what is in it , "" he said .
Reid will bring a so - called motion to proceed vote on Wednesday followed by a cloture vote to end debate on Friday or Saturday .
This requires 60 votes to pass , but without the support of Republican leaders , Cruz and Lee are unlikely to stop it going through .
After that , Reid is free to introduce an amendment on Sunday to the original budget resolution which strips out the threat to defund Obamacare and only requires 51 votes to pass .
This would mean a so - called "" clean "" budget resolution will be sent back to the House on Monday with only hours to go until the government funding authorisation expires .
Republicans may still choose to force a government shut down at this point , but speaker John Boehner is increasingly expected to allow a vote that would pass the budget resolution with help from Democrats and a minority of House Republicans ."
2013-09-25,"In the sense that the Senate is a space for windbags to blow hard , Ted Cruz has over the last two days elevated the institution to within historic reach of its perfect self .
Cruz , a Republican from Texas , spoke from 2.40pm ET Tuesday to 12.03pm ET
Wednesday , his speech interrupted only by "" questions "" from friendly senators who dropped in to show their support .
Few â€ “ literally three people ever , so far â€ “ have held the floor longer , and arguably none has ever spouted such a pure mist of intellectually disingenuous , self - aggrandizing spritz .
It is the stuff of which legends are made , and Cruz , with his speech , took a step to becoming a Senate legend .
In a political climate that prizes zeal above all virtue , Cruz proved a zeal that no articulation of an idea or voting record could demonstrate .
He proved it with his feet and back and legs .
He proved it with his spine .
He proved it with his apparently steel - clad bladder .
This will help Cruz For his impressive effort , Cruz will be crowned by a certain American constituency , the lesser zealot kings , who until now have had to make do with leaders who have one after another failed in their resolve , sold out , quit the governorship or left elected office for a lobby or a think tank .
All appearances are that Cruz will run for president in 2016 .
When primary voters queue in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina , this night will be remembered , and it will accrue in Cruz 's favor .
It will not , however , end Obamacare
The intermittent topic of Cruz 's speech is Obamacare , the healthcare law passed in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012 .
On Monday the House of Representatives passed a budget bill with a provision to "" defund "" the president 's health law ( a symbolic gambit with serious practical hurdles ) .
On Wednesday afternoon the Senate is scheduled to vote to take up the House bill .
Then the Senate leader , Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada , will toss out the "" defund "" part and Obamacare will live on .
It 's not like what Wendy Davis ' did in Texas
What Cruz ostensibly tried to do is prevent the Senate from taking up the House bill .
However under Senate rules he must cede the floor when the previously scheduled afternoon vote comes up .
That 's why Cruz 's speech was not technically a filibuster ; he did not have indefinite control of the floor .
Control of the floor is what lent such drama to a filibuster undertaken in June by Texas state senator Wendy Davis .
By speaking for 11 hours straight , over the jeers of colleagues and cheers of supporters , Davis prevented a vote on a bill placing tight new restrictions on abortion .
Davis was carried off the field as a hero , although the state legislature eventually passed the bill which was signed into ( likely unconstitutional ) law .
It does n't matter that this is not technically a filibuster
The fact that Cruz stood to gain no legislative victory leaves him , in this most dramatic moment of his own creation , open to accusations of self - service , as opposed to public service .
The details of the Senate rules are not , however , likely to be remembered in all this , just as the substance of the healthcare law was not up for debate in the hours upon hours that Cruz supposedly talked about it .
What will be remembered was the endurance and zeal of Ted Cruz .
Which will engender in some Americans an admiration and gratitude they may hope to repay in votes ."
2013-09-26,"Over the past couple of days , as I 've watched Ted Cruz capture the political world 's attention and drive the GOP 's self - defeating strategy on the budget and the debt limit , I 've tried to think about what is the best metaphor to describe his extraordinary political rise â€ “ from freshman Texas senator to ideological lodestar of the Republican party .
Is he a modern - day version of George Wallace ( in Gary Younge 's analogy ) ?
Is he Elmer Gantry ?
Is he Frankenstein ?
No , he 's the Republican 's Stay - Puft Marshmallow Man .
For those not familiar with the reference , the Stay - Puft Marshmallow Man is "" the form of the destructor "" in the 1983 film , Ghostbusters .
He seems harmless .
After all , it 's a giant marshmallow with a jaunty sailor 's cap .
But in reality , he is a 60 ft anthropomorphized destroyer , who is chosen ( inadvertently ) to wage the movie 's final showdown between the forces of good ( the ghostbusters ) and the forces of bad ( Gozer ) .
Now , in the end of the movie everything works out for the best and everyone lives happily ever after ( except , unfortunately , for those who paid to see Ghostbusters II ) .
Things , however , are unlikely to work out so well for the Republican party .
For Cruz , on the other hand , capitalizing on the GOP 's descent into madness is a deft political move that positions him well to be a clear frontrunner to win the party 's presidential nod in 2016 .
Over the past several decades , Republicans have cultivated the party 's most reactionary , uncompromising and extremist base of supporters .
They have portrayed government as a deeply nefarious and destructive force ; they have fetishized ideological rigidity ; they have derided and demonized compromise of any sort ; they have destroyed the party 's moderate wing and even drove conservatives out of the party for not being conservative enough .
Things are so bad that Liz Cheney is taking on incumbent Mike Enzi for the Senate seat in Wyoming .
The reason for the primary challenge : he 's not obstructionist enough and has committed the sin of actually talking with Democrats in the US Senate .
That such a challenge would come after a period in which Congress entered a new stratosphere of dysfunction and uselessness is practically unimaginable .
But alas , here we are .
Of course , when it comes to Obama , the GOP 's rhetoric has been turned up to "" 11 "" .
Republicans have played on the fears of those who believe Obama is a socialist , Muslim , or a proud native son of Kenya .
They have decried his war on political freedom ; his war on gun rights ; his war on business ; his war on the middle class ; his war on the nation 's future generations ; and his surrender to foreign tyrants .
And they have portrayed his policies as a fast train to America 's destruction
â€ “ none more so than his signature legislation , Obamacare .
Since 2009 , Republicans have practically fallen over themselves to describe a plan to provide health insurance coverage for 30 million people and lower healthcare costs as "" the worst thing ever to happen to America "" .
According to Republicans , Obamacare represents a government takeover of the healthcare system ( it 's not ) ; it was passed in violation of the will of the American people ( it was n't ) ; it covers illegal immigrants ( it does n't , but it should ) ; it will put government bureaucrats in charge of your healthcare decision ( it wo n't ) ; it is already causing widespread job losses ( it 's not ) and will destroy the economy ( it wo n't ) .
Mitch McConnell , the Senate minority leader , calls it the "" single worst piece of legislation passed in the last 50 years "" .
Congressman John Fleming â€ “
a Louisiana Republican â€ “ went even further , describing Obamacare as "" the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress "" , and "" the most existential threat "" to the US economy "" since the Great Depression "" .
The House of Representatives has now voted more than 40 times to repeal the bill and is actively working to sabotage the law .
Conservatives are even running a creepy series of ads encouraging young people to eschew Obamacare and subsidized healthcare coverage , which , it must be said , is one of the more morally depraved activities that this country has seen from a major political group in some time .
But in the GOP jihad against Obamacare , this sort of action is par for the course .
Indeed , opposition to Obamacare and the demand by Republicans â€ “ largely instigated by Cruz â€ “ that any budget or debt limit extension be tied to the defunding or delay of Obamacare has led to a possible government shutdown next week .
It 's an act both destructive and unworkable .
Obama is not going to sign a bill undercutting his signature legislation , and they 'll take the blame , which will be politically damaging .
So , why pursue this suicidal , self - defeating course ?
Enter Ted Cruz â€ “ the destructor .
Though many Republicans are wary , conservatives like Cruz have demanded this strategy â€ “ and have challenged the conservative bona fides of any who fail to get in line .
A month ago , speaker of the House John Boehner was powerless to resist the crazies and finally relented , introducing legislation that tied the federal budget to a defunding of Obamacare .
This move led numerous Republicans to violate Ronald Reagan 's so - called "" 11th commandment "" â€ “ "" Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican "" â€ “ as the two most senior GOP members have attacked Cruz .
But none of this should be a surprise to them .
Republicans have spent so much time describing Obamacare in the most dire terms imaginable , is n't it completely consistent for some Republicans to take this rhetoric to its logical conclusion ?
To be sure , Republicans will find their way out of this current mess , most likely by conceding defeat and passing a clean continuing resolution and debt limit extension .
But that will only begin the intra - party bloodletting .
For conservatives like Cruz , who , in just nine months in office , has become a hero to the party 's base , it 's precisely this retreat that he is counting on .
It will only strengthen his political message that the problem for Republicans is the cadre of sellouts like McConnell , Boehner et al who refuse to follow through on their conservative principles .
For a politician like Cruz , who clearly has his eyes set on national office , defeat for the GOP on Obamacare will be his ultimate victory .
Indeed , we 've seen repeatedly over the past two election cycles that the more radical a Republican is , the more likely he or she is to defeat a slightly less radical Republican in a Senate or House primary .
This is actually how Cruz became a senator .
In the end , Republicans have no one to blame but themselves for their current crisis .
Ted Cruz was created by Republicans who persistently ramped up the extremism of their attacks on government and on Obama .
That reached a point where Cruz 's brand of crazy , heartless , morally wanton , uncompromising conservatism is now the default position of the party .
Unfortunately for Republicans , unlike the Ghostbusters , there is no escape from the monster they created ."
2013-09-26,"The Texas Republican Ted Cruz may have racked up one of the longest performances in the US Senate , but his 21-hour speech exposed as much about the fault lines in the Republican party as it achieved its stated objective of stirring up opposition to Barack Obama 's signature health reforms .
Within minutes of sitting down in the Senate to applause from conservative hardliners , Cruz received a public lecture from his fellow Republican , former presidential candidate John McCain , on the need to respect legislation that has been passed in a democratic manner .
"" I wo n't take too much time â€ “ the floor here has been well used over the last day or so , "" quipped McCain before the GOP grandee reminded the first - term senator of the struggle put up by Republicans to block the passage of Obama 's healthcare reform in 2009 .
"" We fought as hard as we could , in a fair and honest manner , and we lost .
And we lost , one of the reasons is because we were in the minority .
And , in democracies , almost always , the majority governs and passes legislation , "" he added .
McCain also chastised Cruz for comparing the battle against Obamacare to the second world war , which he said did "" a great disservice "" to Americans who fought against the Nazis .
None of which bothered Cruz who has made a virtue out of bucking against the GOP old guard .
When he took the floor of the senate at 2:40pm ET on Tuesday , he knew there was no chance of blocking the passage of what is known as a continuing resolution : a motion to maintain funding for the federal government .
The resolution passed the House of Representatives on Friday , but is the subject of controversy because Republicans tacked on a provision that would defund the non - mandatory elements of the Affordable Care Act .
Cruz had already negotiated his time on the floor with Senate majority leader Harry Reid , who permitted the speech as long as it fell within the time already allotted for debate on the continuing resolution .
There was never a chance that the resolution would be delayed : Cruz always knew that he would have to give way to a procedural vote on Wednesday .
Indeed , after sitting down , he joined every other senator in allowing debate on the resolution to continue .
But Cruz never intended to be a slave to logic .
He knew that the details would be lost on the general public : all they would hear was his anti - Obamacare message .
Cruz even read a "" bedtime story "" to his daughters from the Dr Seuss children 's classic Green Eggs and Ham , whose central message is that people will like something that appears unpalatable when they try it .
Cruz was much more attuned to another message , that he came across as a loving , hardworking father .
Senior Republicans in the Senate could barely disguise their irritation at Cruz , who hit back in a retaliatory interview with the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh on Wednesday .
"" The single biggest surprise about arriving to the Senate is the defeatist attitude here , "" Cruz said in the interview , quoted by the Huffington Post .
He accused his fellow Republicans of being "" beaten down "" and "" scared of this fight "" .
Senate Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn had urged the members of their conference not to risk a government shutdown in a futile bid to overturn Obamacare .
They stood on the sidelines as Cruz was joined on the floor by a clutch of conservative senators likely to become frontrunners for 2016 Republican presidential nomination , including Marco Rubio and Rand Paul .
All three are far less concerned than their party leadership with appearing to disrespect the Senate process , calculating that Republican voters in the 2016 primary race will be impressed with their determination to buck the Washington consensus , even if â€ “ as seems likely â€ “
they fail to block the Affordable Care Act during the current standoff over federal spending authorisation .
Speaking to reporters after his marathon speech â€ “ the fourth longest in Senate history â€ “ Cruz was unrepentant , insisting he wanted to give the American people a voice in the process .
However , while the episode may have done little damage to 2016 primary hopefuls , it has so far focused public attention as much on feuding Republicans as Obama 's controversial healthcare reforms .
The Senate clash also points to a similar generational split likely to erupt among House Republicans this weekend when the spending bill returns to the lower chamber stripped of the original proposal to veto Obamacare .
House speaker John Boehner will be under intense pressure to allow an immediate majority vote on the so - called "" clean bill "" or risk being blamed for shutting down the government when current spending authorisation expires on Monday night .
But Tea Party supporters in the House who originally forced Boehner into linking funding authorisation to the Affordable Care Act will be aghast at any perceived retreat and could threaten to oust Boehner if he relies on House Democrats to pass the bill .
Democrats meanwhile were doing as little as possible to help Republicans out of their hole on Wednesday .
Senate majority leader Harry Reid spurned a last - minute offer from Cruz to speed up passage of the bill â€ “ a move that would have given Boehner more time to reach a compromise with his own party before the spending limit expires .
Instead , it is possible that the Senate will not complete its series of planned votes on the bill until Sunday , leaving Boehner less than 24 hours to avoid shutting down the government or splitting his own party .
Barack Obama has chosen to keep his distance in recent days , refusing to countenance a negotiation over debt and spending limits he claims are being held hostage by radical Republican groups .
But White House spokesman Carney could barely contain the glee felt by many Democrats on Monday when he said the stand - off reflected "" enormous divisions within the Republican party that are hard for us to influence . ""
""
Internal Republican party politics while absolutely the most fascinating political story in Washington right now , and something I would be choosing to focus on if I were still a reporter , are not something we are choosing to spend a lot of time right now , "" added Carney ."
2013-09-27,"A narrow majority of Senate Republicans took steps to try to avoid a US government shutdown on Friday , voting in favour of a procedural motion that passes the vexed spending bill back to their more radical colleagues in the House of Representatives .
Only 19 Republican senators , led by Ted Cruz of Texas , voted against the so - called cloture motion , which marked the last chance for Republicans to prevent Democrats from stripping out a clause that would defund the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare .
Two subsequent Senate votes , stripping out the Obamacare threat and agreeing final passage of the so - called "" clean "" spending bill , were each passed along party lines by 54 to 44 .
Twenty - five Republicans voted with Democrats in favour of allowing the spending authorisation bill to progress .
But Cruz predicted that his House colleagues would stand their ground against Obamacare and refuse to accept the spending bill which will now be sent back to them by the Senate .
House conservatives are threatening to try once again to attach measures aimed at scrapping Obamacare before pinging the bill back to the Senate hours before current spending authorisation expires on Monday night .
"" When it comes back to this body in a few days , I very much hope we unite , "" said Cruz shortly before the series of Senate votes on Friday .
Watched by a number of allies from the lower chamber , including congressman Justin Amash of Michigan , Cruz succeeding in garnering support from a clutch of fellow conservative senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky but fell significantly short of the 40 votes needed to block passage of the bill .
With the help of Republican leaders , Senate majority leader Harry Reid secured a total of 80 votes in favour of cloture , allowing him to stage three more straightforward majority votes that stripped out the Obamacare threat and sent the so - called continuing resolution back to the House .
The scale of the Republican split in the Senate may help moderates in the House who are urging the party to step back from its threat to shut down to the government if Obamacare is not blocked .
House speaker John Boehner has been urging colleagues to turn their fire instead on a separate budget fight over whether to extend government borrowing limits in mid - October .
But many House Republicans were in uncompromising mood on Friday morning , and are threatening to attach more riders to the spending bill over the weekend ."
2013-10-02,"I arrived at 9 am as planned , with $ 10 in my pocket and a sheet of phone numbers .
Sonya was missing , her corner space now just a bed of cardboard , a bundle of dirty blankets , broken needles , and a Bible .
Her kitten was gone , presumably given to a friend to watch , or maybe it fled , scared by the roar of semi - trucks only 10 meters away .
I walked the stretch of the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx , New York , where she begs for money .
At 10 am I found her leaning against a pole .
She smiled , "" I just need to get straight before I go "" .
I have learned the language of addicts .
She was talking about one last hit of heroin before entering detox .
The thought of being dope sick in a waiting room is just too much .
Nobody had drugs available this early ; she had to call for a delivery that came an hour later .
Most of her veins are dry , shriveled from overuse .
Except in her foot .
She took off her shoes and asked for privacy : My feet really stink , sorry , get all soggy in these shoes .
Out here you ca n't really wear heels .
I grabbed her small purse , once red but now black .
Inside was her paperwork : an expired driver 's license from a happier time , a Medicaid letter crumpled and torn .
I struggled to make out her information ; maybe it was a letter E or an F on her Medicaid ID , maybe a three or an eight .
I wrote down the different possibilities .
I waited in the car , calling different hospitals and inpatient programs that accept those who only have Medicaid .
Most calls went to voicemail , doomed to become messages unreturned .
Forty minutes of calling netted me three rejections , all the places were filled or needed proof of residence .
I explained she slept under an overpass .
They shrugged .
Rules are rules .
Desperate , I called a place nearby , a place most addicts hate , a place with "" nasty doctors and nurses who treat you like shit "" .
"" What is her Medicaid ID ? ""
I repeated the numbers and letters .
"" What is her drug of choice and when was the last time she used ? "" I looked over at Sonya , still hidden in her corner , working on her foot . ""
Her drug is heroin and the last time is five minutes from now .
"" They had a bed .
She slept in the van as I drove , overpowered by a bar of Xanax she neglected to tell me about .
She slept again in the drab detox intake room , filled with others desperate to be clean .
The smell of urine and bleach was overpowering .
Two college kids were giving a lecture on healthy eating , passing out flyers .
They left one on Sonya 's lap .
After an hour of confusion , she was turned down .
Her Medicaid coverage had expired .
Renewal letters never reached her patch of dirt she calls home .
Sonya returned to her spot , coiled on the cardboard and collapsed into the blankets , the Bible under her head .
I have tried about 15 times to take homeless addicts to detox .
Only twice has it worked , and only after days of navigating misinformation and filling out paperwork .
One addict was turned down after eight hours of driving from clinic to clinic , because they were not in withdrawal at the time .
I asked what in the hell I have to do to help get an addict clean .
A doctor , angry at his time being taken , responded : Just drop them off sick at the emergency room .
They have to take them .
I did that once , waiting amongst families with ill children , families who are forced to use the ER as their primary care physician .
We waited five hours .
It ended with the addict running into the street to vomit , sick from withdrawal , his pants soiled .
After dropping Sonya off , I drove home .
The radio news was filled with reports on Senator Ted Cruz 's 20-hour marathon rant against healthcare reform , which includes an expansion of Medicaid to cover an additional 21.3 million people .
Ted Cruz has access to wonderful healthcare coverage , available either through his government job or his wife 's job at Goldman Sachs .
I also have secure access to quality healthcare , because of my prior job on Wall Street .
Unlike Sonya , when I was battling a penchant for beer , I had many luxurious options : weeks away in a country estate or a private suite that offered family visits .
I never went that route , but it was always available to me and others as fortunate .
I understand now , after so many frustrations and failures dealing with one of America 's most neglected and at - risk populations , how lucky I am to have those choices .
Ted Cruz does not ."
2013-10-05,"As an appetiser before helping to send the US government into famine mode , Ted Cruz railed against Obamacare on the Senate floor last month in a publicity - seeking speech that lasted more than 21 hours and included a Darth Vader impression and reading Dr Seuss 's Green Eggs and Ham as a bedtime story for his daughters , who watched on TV .
While the grandstanding was largely symbolic , Cruz has been more than just a figurehead for the Republican showdown over Obamacare that has prompted a government shutdown .
The first - term senator from Texas has emerged as an unofficial envoy between conservatives in the House of Representatives and Senate , spending hours with Tea Party supporters such as congressman Justin Amash to plot what , with hindsight , has been a highly orchestrated plan of attack .
It began over the summer with television ads reminding grassroots conservatives that it was not too late to block Obama 's four - year - old Affordable Care Act by cutting off its funding .
With expectations raised , Cruz ruffled feathers among mainstream Republicans by helping to bounce House speaker John Boehner into a confrontational stand - off over the normally routine continuing budget resolution .
Cruz is used to mainstream Republican opprobrium â€ “ John McCain famously described him and fellow conservative Rand Paul as "" wacko birds "" â€ “ but he briefly became the most hated figure in Congress when he then failed to follow through on his strategy by winning enough support in the Senate , leaving Boehner blamed for shutting down the government . ""
[ Cruz ] pushed House Republicans into traffic and wandered away , "" sniped tax campaigner Grover Norquist in an interview last week .
Since then , however , "" Cruz control "" has begun to look more sure - footed again .
His strategy of blaming Obama for the shutdown by refusing to negotiate is unlikely to succeed in persuading anyone who has been following proceedings closely , but may confuse ordinary voters enough to blame both sides equally .
Republicans have also boxed the White House into a corner by selectively offering to fund ideologically favoured bits of the government such as the military and national monuments .
Angrily dismissed as a gimmick by the administration which blocked most of these piecemeal measures but was forced to accept others , this tactic has succeeded in making it look as if Obama wanted to keep as many hostages in the room as possible .
Eventually , Boehner may have to cut a deal with moderate Republicans and Democrats that would end the standoff without scrapping Obamacare , but for now the conservative grassroots could not be happier .
Battling the federal government on almost any issue is a crowd - pleasing tactic in Texas , the most stubborn and independent - minded state in the union .
"" I think he 's doing great , "" said Beth Cubriel , executive director at the Republican party of Texas .
"" He 's a voice for people who are so frustrated that as long as the president has been in power the conservative view has not been covered . ""
Cruz won an underdog victory in the Texas Republican primary last year , preaching a fiery rightwing gospel that made his establishment - backed opponent , David Dewhurst , seem moderate and mainstream .
As a Latino , Cruz helps Texas Republicans to woo an increasingly important and left - leaning demographic while retaining traditional conservative values â€ “ even though he comes across as an upstart outsider . ""
He ran very effectively as an anti - establishment candidate , however counter - intuitive that seems for a Harvard - educated lawyer , "" said Jim Henson , director of the Austin - based Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas .
"" We could n't be prouder of Ted Cruz , "" said Julie Turner , president of the Texas Patriots PAC , a Tea Party group .
"" Ted Cruz is the tuning fork for the conservative movement . ""
Turner fondly recalled an impromptu pre - election rally near Houston with Cruz and his wife giving speeches from the back of a pick - up truck : "" They spoke our values then he went to Washington and followed them . ""
While Cruz 's rise to fame was sudden , Felicia Cravens of the Houston Tea Party Society said that it was carefully planned : "" He 's been making the circuit of Tea Party events since 2009 .
He 'd go to meetings of any size , speak to as few as 10 people .
He put in the shoe leather early on to make contact with people who could be influence - makers . ""
The 42-year - old was born in Canada , the son of a Cuban father and American mother .
He grew up in Houston and went to Princeton and Harvard Law School , where he was seen as brilliant but arrogant .
Then he worked on George W Bush 's 2000 presidential campaign .
After a period in Washington , Cruz returned to Texas to become solicitor general , overseeing appeal cases and taking on high - profile supreme court battles on topics such as gun rights , abortion and religious symbols .
In one of his proudest moments , he helped to persuade the supreme court that Texas had the right to execute a Mexican national convicted of murder , despite opposition from President Bush and the International Court of Justice , which ruled the case should be reopened .
Polls this year suggest that a quarter of Texans adore him and a similar amount loathe him .
On Thursday , several dozen department of defence workers protested outside Cruz 's San Antonio office , wielding placards with slogans such as "" Ted â€ “ go furlough yourself "" .
Bob Comeaux , a Democratic activist , joined them .
"" I think he is a very fine advocate for the seven or eight per cent of crazy people in the state of Texas , "" he said .
"" I have a niece who 's a firefighter who 's required to go to work for no pay .
What kind of a country is that requires people to work for no pay ?
In Texas it used to be we 'd elect politicians to get something done .
Now there 's a mentality to send people up there [ to DC ] to make sure nothing gets done . ""
A meeting of Senate Republicans on Wednesday turned into an anti - Cruz "" lynch mob "" , according to the New York Times .
Alienating colleagues is hardly a recipe for longevity in the Senate , especially if Texans conclude Cruz is more interested in his own future than theirs . ""
The shelf - life of a very conservative member of the Senate is short , "" said Brandon Rottinghaus , associate politics professor at the University of Houston .
"" It 's hard to govern if you 're outside the boundaries of your party and your tactics are explosive . ""
But by the time his Senate seat is up for grabs again in 2018 , Cruz presumably hopes his cowboy - booted feet will be on the desk of the Oval Office , a maverick intellectual improbably carried to ultimate power by those who love to hate big government .
It would be quite a story to tell ."
2013-10-12,"I have written about gerrymandering before , but the issue is back to the fore because numerous commentators have posited a link between gerrymandering and the shutdown .
Gerrymandering is now commonly given as the reason why congressional districts appear to be producing more conservative and/or Tea Party - allied Republican representatives .
I still believe the supposed effects of gerrymandering on political polarization in the House of Representatives are being overstated .
And fine work from Nate Cohn and Sean Trende explains the point very well .
I just have one more thing to add to the argument : what about Ted Cruz ?
Texas Senator Ted Cruz is seen as a figurehead for Tea Party conservatives .
It 's even been reported that House Republicans have been taking directions from him in refusing to pass a clean continuing resolution without defunding or delaying Obamacare .
So did gerrymandering create Ted Cruz , too ?
The answer , of course , is no .
Ted Cruz was elected to the United States Senate ; he has never served in the House .
Senators are voted for in state - wide elections , which means that redistricting and gerrymandering logically ca n't apply .
Yet , Cruz is as conservative as , if not more conservative than , the House GOP members who , many believe , are keeping the government shut down and flirting with debt default .
Admittedly , Ted Cruz is just one elected official , but he 's played a larger - than - life role in the current crisis .
And , more importantly perhaps , he is part of a larger trend in the United States Senate , in three ways .
First , Cruz is from the state of Texas .
And Texas is a deep red state , which makes it characteristic of a pattern of states becoming more polarized .
As I 've noted before , there used to be a great many states that were very competitive in national elections .
In 1976 , almost half the states in the union came within 3pt of the nationwide vote in the presidential election .
A more impressive 30-plus states were within 5pt .
Today , the numbers are n't even close to that .
There were only eight states that came within 3pt of the national vote in the 2012 presidential race .
That number only rises to ten when we include states where the margin was within 5pt of the nationwide margin â€ “ only a third of the number there were in 1976 .
Even if you expanded the list to include those within 10pt , you 'd still only get to 14 states .
It 's fairly clear , then , that people are "" self - sorting "" on the state level .
As Sean Trende shows , this filters down to the congressional district level rather well .
The number of districts that most would call "" competitive "" under even the Democratic - written district lines of the 1990s would have been about the same .
Second , Cruz 's election was one of many where voters decided that they wanted their senatorial vote to reflect their presidential vote .
Just 20 years ago , a similar party allocation in the Senate featured many more blue state Republicans and red state Democrats .
In 1993 , 49 % of the Democrats ' Senate caucus came from states that had voted more Republican than the nation as a whole in the prior presidential election .
That percentage has been cut in half , to only 25 % in 2013 .
It 's the same story with the Republican Senate caucus .
Republicans from blue states were 28 % of the Senate Republicans in 1993 .
Today , the percentage is only 16 % .
So , what we have is increased polarization in the voting patterns of states on the presidential level , which has translated down to the senatorial level .
Note , as Nate Silver has shown , this is the same phenomenon that is occurring on the congressional district level â€
“ even when controlling for changing districting lines .
The third factor is that the increased polarization of the states seems to be reflected in the senators ' voting records .
The Senate ( as well as the House ) is now more polarized than it 's been in the past 135 years .
How do we know ?
The people over at Voteview score each roll - call vote : -1 is most liberal , while + 1 is most conservative , per Voteview 's "" DW nominate "" score .
They then were kind enough to map the average difference between the Senate 's Democratic and Republican caucus .
This shows that there have been increasing differences in the average voting scores of the Republican and Democratic Senate caucuses , respectively , since the 1976 election .
The polarization accelerated after the 1992 election .
It 's simply not possible that gerrymandering was the sole cause of this trend .
It 's not as though anyone can , all of a sudden , start moving around state lines .
Now , none of this is to say that gerrymandering is n't responsible for some part of the polarization in Washington .
The median Democratic and Republican House district is more polarized than the median Democratic and Republican Senate seat .
The House caucuses have more extreme voting records than the Senate 's .
Some of that is , again , due to self - sorting on the state level more locally , but not all of it can be accounted for that way .
The Senate shows , however , that the sharp upswing in polarization we see today is largely the product of natural voting patterns .
And these manifest themselves on the state level without any gerrymandering .
Texas put Ted Cruz in the Senate not because someone redrew Texas ' state lines , but because Texas voters became , on average , more conservative ."
2013-10-13,"Sarah Palin , Ted Cruz and other conservative Republicans led a protest on Sunday which tore down barriers at a second world war memorial in Washington and confronted police outside the White House .
Palin , the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice - presidential nominee , accused President Barack Obama of using war veterans as pawns in the two - week - old federal government shutdown .
"" We are here to honour our vets , "" she told a crowd at the national mall , which has been fenced off since 1 October .
"" You look around though and you see these barricades and you have to ask yourself is this any way that a commander in chief would show his respect , his gratitude to our military .
This is a matter of shutdown priorities .
"" Obama could lift the barricades if he wished , she said , adding : "" Our veterans should be above politics . ""
Cruz , a Texas senator and fellow Tea Party darling , accused Obama of targeting the memorial : "" He said , ' If you open the memorial I will veto it ' .
"" Thousands of people , accompanied by tractors with blaring horns , converged on the plaza and sang "" God bless America "" .
Later some tore down barriers and carried them to the White House , where they dumped them while chanting "" shame on you "" to police in riot gear .
The protest fuelled a febrile mood as congressional Democrats and Republicans sought an elusive compromise to end the government shutdown and avert an impending default on US debt .
Polls show most Americans blame Republicans for the crisis .
Tea Party activists raised the stakes and forced more mainstream Republicans into a corner by linking the fiscal battle to a campaign to repeal the administration 's healthcare law .
Sunday 's protest attempted to shift blame for the memorial closures , one of the most politically sensitive , on to the White House .
It came ahead of a big veterans ' rally scheduled for Tuesday , when thousands of former service members are expected in Washington to express concern that the shutdown will disrupt disability payments and other benefits .
"" It could be , in worst - case scenario , a suicide spike .
Emotional stability drops , "" Ryan Lamke , a wounded veteran , told CNN . ""
I mean , we 're talking about a population of veterans that are not seeking out the mental health care they so desperately need . ""
The political battle over memorials follows a separate row over "" phony "" arrival ceremonies , in which flag - draped coffins of dead military personnel were carried from planes and presented to relatives .
In fact the remains of those killed in Vietnam or the second world war had often arrived weeks or months earlier and been stored in a laboratory run by the Hawaii - based Joint POW / MIA Accounting Command agency .
Many of the C-17 cargo planes were towed into position because they can no longer fly , fuelling accusations that the ceremonies , which include bugles and bagpipes , were misleading theatre .
In a statement to NBC , which broke the story last week , the Pentagon said the "" arrival ceremonies "" would henceforth be known as "" honour ceremonies "" to avoid confusion ."
2013-10-19,"Matt Rinaldi : ' Cruz 's courageous stand exposed Quisling Republicans ' Senator Ted Cruz is the biggest threat to business as usual in Washington in the last 25 years â€ “ and that is a great thing for America .
His grassroots campaign for Senate in 2012 promised action , not mere talk , in addressing Obamacare and our nation 's $ 17tn and ever - growing debt .
Much to the chagrin of Beltway insiders , he has unapologetically delivered .
Cruz 's position was eminently reasonable .
He encouraged the GOP to fund every portion of the government with the exception of the very unpopular Affordable Care Act â€ “ Obamacare 's official name .
This would allow Democrats and Republicans to then negotiate changes to a law opposed by more than 50 % of Americans .
In response , Democrats chose to force a partial government shutdown and blame the GOP until it agreed to fund the law with no changes .
The fight against Obamacare is not a Tea Party issue or even a Republican issue ; it is an American issue .
Obamacare is a disaster even from the perspective of Democrats .
Obama pledged the law would lower premiums by up to $ 2,500 per year for a typical family by January 2013 and improve the economy .
In practice , the law has encouraged employers to shed full - time jobs on a massive scale , induced doctors to leave their fields and raised premiums by as much as 300 % .
This is before it is even fully implemented .
The fight over the funding of Obamacare was a fight that needed to be fought .
The potential negative effects of a shutdown were real but overblown , especially when weighed against the potential disaster posed by Obamacare 's implementation .
Despite the president 's deliberate attempt to talk down the markets and the media 's dramatic warnings of economic Armageddon posed by a mere 17 % of the government remaining temporarily idle , the S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high the day after the shutdown ended .
Neither the shutdown nor the debt limit deadline , as Moody 's confirms , ever posed any real threat of default .
Cruz 's bold stand against Obamacare was attacked by GOP senators primarily on the basis that the outcome was inevitable .
Yet , their very opposition to Cruz made it inevitable .
If Republicans had held firm and directed their fire against Democrats and Obamacare , Democrats would be forced to defend their decision to shut down the government in order to protect a massively unpopular and unworkable piece of legislation .
Instead , from day one , Senate Republicans conceded defeat , turned their fire on Ted Cruz ; and House Republicans and echoed Democrat talking points .
With this initial bargaining position , what reason did Democrats have to negotiate ?
Democrats entered this fight to save Obamacare ; Cruz and conservatives entered this fight to save Americans from Obamacare .
Though conservatives lost in the end , the battle accomplished something important .
Cruz 's courageous stand against Washington exposed Quisling Republicans to an electorate tired of empty words .

Since General Robert E Lee surrendered at Appomattox , disaffected white folks from below Mason and Dixon 's defining line have liked to declare , "" the south will rise again . ""
Unfortunately for all of us , they 've been proven right .
For the past two weeks , the south , in the guise of a neoconfederate rump in Congress , held the United States hostage .
Two - thirds of the 30 to 40 members of the House who shut down the government and gleefully pushed the country toward defaulting on our debt come from former slave states .
Opponents of the Affordable Care Act from Florida to Tennessee deploy regulatory roadblocks , such as refusing healthcare "" navigators "" access to county health departments , inspired by the "" massive resistance "" southern governors and legislatures used to repulse desegregation .
Echoing the tactics of Jim Crow politicians in the 1950s and 60s , Ralph Hudgens , Georgia 's Insurance Commissioner , promised that when it came to "" Obamacare "" , he 'd do "" everything in our power to be an obstructionist "" .
Whether in office or stomping around in a powdered wig and tricorn hat , Tea Party zealots claim they 're fighting to save the soul of America , a mission so crucial they would n't have minded crashing the global economy to do it .
To them , government is evil .
President Barack Obama is a "" Marxist - Leninist "" hell - bent on destroying freedom â€ “
a dictator who lights his cigarettes with smouldering copies of the constitution as he invites brown - skinned aliens to overrun the country , and imposes socialism upon us all .
We have seen this before .
With the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 , southern states felt â€ “ as South Carolina 's articles of secession put it
â€
“
they 'd "" no longer have the power of self - government , or self - protection , and the federal government will have become their enemy "" .
The south 's ruling elites called for a second American Revolution to restore their version of constitutional government .
That "" revolution "" is better known as the American civil war â€ “ the bloody internecine conflict in which 750,000 Americans died .
Though the Confederacy lost in 1865 , its heirs still holler for war against their own government .
Last Sunday , in Washington , DC , about 200 people took part in what was billed as the "" Million Vet March "" .
Some used the old white supremacist scare tactic of waving Confederate battle flags in front of the home of a black family â€ “ in this case , the White House .
Others , such as Rep Michele Bachmann and Senator Ted Cruz , revelled in the government shutdown , then pitched a fit when they discovered that the parks and memorials in DC 's care were n't open ( logic is n't a Tea Party virtue ) .
Meanwhile , Freedom Watch 's Larry Klayman called for "" a second American nonviolent revolution "" , compounding the silliness with a call "" that this president leave town , to get up , to put the Qur'an down , to get up off his knees , and to figuratively come out with his hands up . ""
Some areas of the country â€ “ roughly coinciding with Tea Party strongholds in the south and the west â€ “ struggle with the idea that black people are "" real "" Americans , so accepting Barack Obama as the legitimately - elected president of the United States sticks in their collective craw .
Obama won this round , but come 15 January , when Congress must reauthorize another continuing resolution , the neoconfederates will have regrouped and may try once again to "" save "" the country by destroying it .
They say they want to repeal Obamacare , but what they really want to repeal is the modern world .

2013-10-20,"The battle within the Republican party highlighted by the recent government shutdown has damaged the party , hurt innocent Americans and taken attention away from the "" fiasco "" of the rollout of Obamacare , Senator John McCain said on Sunday .
McCain , Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Lindsey Graham , a key McCain ally , tried to present a united front on the Sunday talkshows , insisting that the party 's fight against President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare reform would go on .
Ted Cruz , the first - term senator from Texas who led the charge by the party 's rightwing Tea Party faction to shut down the government and bring the US to the brink of default on its debts , was less conciliatory .
Appearing on CNN and ABC , he blamed Senate Republicans like McCain for abandoning their House colleagues over the shutdown and forcing them to accept a "" lousy "" deal which fell short of the goal of defunding the Affordable Care Act .
Cruz also suggested that he might seek to force another shutdown when the next deadline for agreeing a budget arrives , in January .
Polls show that support for the GOP , which is blamed for the shutdown , is at an all - time low .
Appearing on CNN 's State of the Union , McCain , the 2008 Republican presidential nominee , said problems surrounding the rollout of Obamacare , which were acknowledged on Sunday by the treasury secretary , Jack Lew , would have been a bigger story if conservative Republicans had not staged a "" fools errand "" in their efforts to defund the law through shutting down the federal government . ""
[ There are ] many ironies here , but one of them is the fiasco of this rollout has been obscured because of this internecine strife that 's been going on in the Republican Party , "" McCain said .
Championed by Cruz , House Republicans insisted on attaching to spending bills provisions to defund Obamacare .
The Democrat - controlled Senate refused to accept any such measures , leading to a stalemate that left the country in the grip of a 16-day government shutdown .
Asked if the end of the shutdown without any significant concession on Obamacare had seen Republicans enter a period of civil war , McCain said : "" We have to have some straight talking .
There are some divisions in the Republican party , we 've had them in the past â€
¦ it 's very regrettable because our adversary is not each other
and we will probably have to go through discussion and debate .
""
The Arizona senator , who was one of many senate Republicans to criticise the shutdown strategy , refused to single out Cruz directly .
Instead he said he blamed the "" whole effort "" . ""
Those involved in it went on a fool 's errand , "" he said , adding that Republicans should "" keep up the fight against Obamacare , but do n't shut down the government and have so much collateral damage to innocent Americans . ""
Another shutdown ?
Cruz has not ruled out pursuing another government shutdown .
McCain , pursuing the same line followed by McConnell on CBS 's Face the Nation , said he was confident the American people would not let that happen .
"" It will not happen , "" he said .
"" I am very confident the American people will not stand for another repetition of this disaster . ""
McCain did not call for the resignation of President Barack Obama 's heath secretary , as other Republicans have done .
Asked by CNN 's Gloria Borger if he thought Kathleen Sebelius should resign , McCain said he supported the idea of congressional hearings to find out who was to blame . ""
Let 's find out who is responsible for this fiasco and then take the appropriate action , "" he said .
"" But this is just the beginning of the problems .
That 's why we Republicans have to keep up the fight .
But we have to rifle - shot it rather than go at it with a meat axe , which can not succeed . ""
He said Obamacare 's rollout problems could be easily fixed : "" Send Air Force One out to Silicon Valley , load it up with smart people , bring them back to Washington and fix this problem .
It 's ridiculous .
And everybody knows that . ""
Cruz , who appeared on CNN 's State of the Nation as well as ABC 's This Week , did not rule out attempting to force another shutdown .
Asked by ABC 's Jonathan Karl whether he would rule out blocking funding of the government over Obamacare again , he said : "" I would do anything and I will continue to do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare . ""
What I will do is continue standing [ up for ] the American people , because it is n't working , it 's costing people jobs , and it 's taking away their healthcare . ""
Since the launch of the insurance market federal website on 1 October , the rollout of the Affordable Care Act has been beset with problems .
Users seeking to shop around for insurance have been unable to log in , there have been severe delays and some have reported seeing rates increase when they expected them to go down .
The federal government has reported millions of visitors to the site , but have refused to give figures on how many people have actually enrolled .
A report by the Associated Press on Sunday showed that 476,000 health insurance applications had been filed for Obamacare through federal and state exchanges â€ “ the most detailed measure yet of the glitch - ridden site â€ “ but officials still refuse to release the raw data on how many people have enrolled ."
2013-10-25,"It 's instructive to remember that when the Tea Party first began to gather steam , the name referred to a "" party "" in the celebration sense â€ “ the Boston Tea Party , specifically : an event of planned chaos , a protest that masqueraded as an Indian attack .
Over time , the name has lost its punny puckishness much as the movement has steadily shifted from a proudly anacharical â€ “ even populist â€ “ response and rebellion within the GOP to a smoothly functioning alternative to it .
The government shutdown proved that attempts by the GOP establishment to co - opt the Tea Party as a source of energy just created a network of political sleeper agents .
With its own mechanism for drafting ( and supporting ) candidates , its own agenda , and its own media eco - system , the Tea Party is a third party by almost any criteria but ballot affiliation â€ “ and leadership .
The absence of any official organizational structure might be one reason the Tea Party has remained so lively despite a terrible national reputation and negligible policy achievements .
When something goes wrong , those identified with the failure fade for a time and the attention of Tea Party - identified voters shifts smoothly to someone else .
There 's also no demand for positive policy victories or signature legislation : no one has to win a debate , just spoil the outcome .
Thus it 's no surprise that Ted Cruz is the current face of the Tea Party : All his achievements are proudly in the negative , all his goals are set resolutely in the past .
But the Tea Party 's fickle and hive - like nature virtually demands that Cruz cycle out of the spotlight eventually .
He will either fail to stop something from happening or , perhaps worse , accidently cause something to get done .
For when that happens : here 's a look at some of the Tea Party 's once and perhaps future leaders .
The don't - call - them comebacks : politicians and activists who 've tasted Tea Party 's adoration and have n't given up on a second sip .
These are primarily hacks who clawed their way on stage at some point and are now biding their time in minor - media purgatory with the hope that they 'll be able to fake - controversy themselves into relevance once more .
Herman Cain : the one - time front - runner for the GOP presidential nomination sputtered into the national conversation just this week , asserting the accusations of sexual harassment that sealed the end of his campaign were the work of "" a force bigger than right "" : the Devil .
He is an aggressive and peppy Twitter user and turns up on Fox Business to predict disaster on a regular basis .
Former Congressman Allen West ( Florida ) :
the former congressman who compared the Democrats to Josef Goebbels and worried about Obama supports being a "" threat to the gene pool "" last month left his post as the director of programming for the conservative news aggregator Pajamas Media under allegations of anti - Semitism .
He claimed that he was moving on voluntarily "" to pursue political aspirations . ""
So keep an eye out .
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann ( Minnesota )
: she 's leaving Congress even as an ethics investigation against her continues ; if she is seeking a quieter life you would n't know it by the bombs she keeps throwing :
In the last month , she proclaimed the government reopening to be "" a very sad day "" and said that Obama 's presidency was a sign of the end of the world .
Miley Cyrus played her in an SNL sketch .
Congressman Paul Ryan ( Wisconsin ) : former vice - presidential candidate currently in some kind of witness protection program , but he did manage to smuggle out a Wall Street Journal op - ed that was mostly ignored .
He 's in a gym somewhere , waiting .
Waiting .
Former Governor Sarah Palin ( Alaska ) : will not be ignored , even though people try to :
Her trippy word - salad appearance on Fox during the shutdown prompted an uncharacteristic reining in of the Wasilla wildwoman , with Megyn Kelly desperately trying to stop the crazy train : "" Let me jump in !
Let me jump in !
But I want to ask you a question governor ! ""
Joe "" the plumber ""
Wurzelbacher : His 15 minutes of fame ticks inexorably on , strung out by Wurzelbacher 's proud adoption of the Misunderstood White Guy cause .
He popped into consciousness last month for re - posting a rant about "" wanting a white President . ""
He is also available to act as a plumber .
Most likely to succeed : Sarah Palin .
She combines lack of self - awareness with a contradictory but well - honed sense of what makes good clickbait .
Reporters will never , ever tire of her .
The junior varsity class : They have yet to capture the Tea Party 's full attention , but could bound onto centerstage at any moment .
Senator Mike Lee ( Utah ) :
Right now probably best known as the guy still willing to sit next to Ted Cruz in the Senate cafeteria , Lee was one of the first candidates to stage a "" Tea Party "" challenge to a sitting Republican senator .
Despite a narrow victory in that primary ( that included placing second at the official nominating convention ) , Lee has legislated like a man who believes he 's got the mandate of a movement .
He was at Cruz 's side , literally , during most of the shutdown and echoed the fiery rhetoric of the most extreme conservatives ( he compared the campaign to shutdown the government to the Revolutionary War ) .
Utahans are reportedly unhappy about this â€ “ all the better to move to a national stage !
Congressman Tom Cotton ( Arkansas ) :
Cotton has racked up an impressive amount of national attention as a fresh Republican face , and he 's done it without saying anything especially insane .
He did quote John Wilkes Booth approvingly once , but has reserved his extremism more for policy than punditry â€ “ he wanted to extend sanctions on Iranian human rights violators to family members ( in violation of the Constitution 's prohibition against conviction on the basis of "" corruption of blood "" ) and was among those to vote for stripping food stamp provisions from the Farm Bill ( this despite representing a third of Arkansas ' over 500,000 food stamp recipients ) .
He 's challenging a conservative Democrat , Mark Pryor , rather than a moderate Republican in the state 's Senate race ; a win could put him at the mean girls table with Lee and Cruz .
Matt Bevin :
Bevin is the Kentucky hedge - fund manager mounting a populist primary challenge to that RINO squish Mitch McConnell ( the current Senate Republican leaader ) .
McConnell 's refusal to champion Tea Party causes â€ “ he did n't speak about the government shutdown until its third day â€ “ has made Bevin attractive to far right fundraisers and activists .
Based more on disappointment in McConnell than Bevin 's promise ( or crazy talk ) , his otherwise quixotic campaign ( unseating a five - term minority leader ) has gotten national attention and support from the likes of the Senate Conservative Fund ( early backers of Cruz and Lee , as well as Cotton ) and Palin .
Most likely to succeed : I 've got my eye on Cotton .
He 's currently beating Democrat Mark Pryor by four points in the US senate race matchup .
Pryor has already put up ads tying Cotton to the shutdown , but the tactic might not succeed as well as it could in other races â€ “ not because Arkansas voters liked the shutdown much more than anyone else , but because Cotton was savvy about moderating his support of it .
In the end , in fact , he was one of the few House Republicans who voted to end it .
Could that cost him national Tea Party support ?
It did n't even cost him the support of the Club for Growth , who has been running ads on his behalf .
As for the Tea party base , once Cotton is in the Senate he wo n't have to answer to voters as often or as quickly and can take the same cost - free extreme stands that other Tea Party senators do .
The models of false - modesty : these elected officials have been lauded as Tea Party leaders despite professed reluctance and unsure attachment .
They have political positions that make for an occasionally uncomfortable fit but seem willing to tailor them if the Tea Party mantle comes with extra large pockets and a presidential berth .
Governor Chris Christie ( New Jersey ) :
despite his notorious post - Sandy embrace of Obama , Christie 's bullying personality echoes favorably among Tea Party supporters .
He casts his history of bipartisan negotiation as a form of steamrolling practicality , and many of his actual policies , save regarding gun control , fit comfortably within the far right framework .
It 's chic now for the hard right to denounce him : he did n't fight gay marriage hard enough , for instance .
But if he can roll out enough insults to Democrats and pal around with more conventional Tea Party heroes such as Steve Lonegan ( the erstwhile GOP NJ senate candidate ) , Christie could convince the conservative base he has their best interests at his large heart .
Senator Marco Rubio ( Florida ) : Rubio was a relatively minor player in the shutdown theater , but he stands to benefit enormously from it as far as Tea Party support goes , as it has weakened the chances that the immigration debate will return to front - and - center .
Rubio 's valiant effort to craft a message on immigration that could appeal to the deeply skeptical conservative fringe shook up what had been a masterful Jenga - like tower of mixed positions : a little Tea Party here , a little GOP careerism there .
He now looks more careerist than ever .
Perhaps more problematic is Rubio 's attempt to distance himself from the shutdown in retrospect : He now says , "" I was never in favor of shutting down the government , "" a story that seems tailored to make him seem reasonable , which wo n't do at all .
Senator Rand Paul ( Kentucky )
: Paul 's weak spot is foreign policyâ€”not so much that he does n't have any experience ( few Tea Party darlings do ) but that he sounds an isolationist note that can register to many self - proclaimed patriots dangerously like weakness .
Paul has been sly about positioning on this , however ; at the Value Voters conference earlier this month , Paul gave a rousingly xenophobic speech heavy on Biblical allusions to Muslims ' perfidyâ€ ¦ he just declined to say we should bomb them .
He thundered , "" I will not rest "" until Christian pastor Saeed Abedini is released from Iranian prison , but was cagey about what his wakefulness entailed : "" everything within our power , within our voice , from the White House , from the State Department , from our government "" stops conspicuously short of military intervention .
That base covered , or at least shaded , Paul 's other positions ( pro - life , pro - gun , against NSA surveillance , Obamacare , regulation in general ) need little protective coloring in the deep red climes of Tea Party nation .
What 's more , his genial stiffness and shy self - awareness give him a kind of awkward dignity compared to the preening smugness of Cruz .
Most likely to succeed : Rand Paul .
I suspect he 'll continue to stand to Cruz 's side for awhile longer , collecting speaking engagements and offering Cruz fulsome praise until Cruz 's moment ends .
The only important variable is when that moment comes ; I 'm betting that Rand hopes it lasts until sometime in the fall of 2015 ."
2013-12-29,"Senator Ted Cruz has said that he is taking steps to renounce his mysterious Canadian citizenship â€ “ in a move he insists does not in any way indicate a run for the White House in 2016 .
The junior senator from Texas , who made a name for himself as a driving force behind efforts to bring down the Affordable Care Act by way of a government shutdown , was surprised to learn earlier this year â€ “ after some digging by one of his home state newspapers â€ “ that he reportedly enjoys dual citizenship .
In an interview with the same organ , the Dallas Morning News , published on Sunday , Cruz announced he was hiring lawyers to help extricate him from his apparently unhelpful surplus nationality .
Cruz was born in the oil - rich region around Calgary , Alberta , to an American mother and a Cuban father .
His mother 's nationality automatically made him an American citizen , regardless of the location of his birth or the citizenship of his father , who later became a naturalised American citizen .
But his arrival into the world on Canadian soil also would have endowed him automatically with the nationality of that country , in accordance with Canadian law .
Cruz , 43 , has always presented himself as purely American and was unaware of possibly holding dual citizenship until the Dallas Morning News presented the notion to him last August
â€ “ a concept Cruz does not dispute "" at this point "" .
"" I have retained counsel that is preparing the paperwork to renounce the citizenship , "" he told the newspaper on Sunday .
According to the newspaper , Cruz and his parents were startled when it was revealed that he was a citizen of both countries .
Cruz said he had been led to believe by his mother that it would have taken an affirmative act of claiming his Canadian citizenship , which the family had never done , to make it so .
Regardless of how many passports Cruz is entitled to hold , the simple fact that he qualifies as a "" natural born American "" because of his mother 's nationality is enough to equip him legally to become president of the United States .
Cruz previously released his birth certificate to the Dallas Morning News , in an effort to hush speculation that he was not a genuine American and therefore would be ineligible to be president .
The rightwing "" birther "" movement still disputes that President Barack Obama is a natural - born American , despite the public presentation of his full birth certificate from his native state of Hawaii .
In the interview published on Sunday , Cruz shrugged off any suggestions that his move was the beginnings of a run for the White House in 2016 .
"" My political perspective is focused on representing the state of Texas , "" he said .
The topic of the senator 's nationality â€ “ and possibly his lofty political ambitions â€ “ reportedly came up last month , when he met with the larger - than - life real estate mogul Donald Trump , one of the most vocal skeptics regarding Obama 's nationality .
Cruz admitted that his Canadian - ness was discussed , "" though not in any significant respect "" .
Cruz has begun making appearances in states that hold the early primaries and caucuses in the selection process for presidential candidates , as well as making moves to raise money for what could be a high - profile campaign .
Following his interview he released a further statement . ""
The Dallas Morning News says that I may technically have dual citizenship , "" it said .
"" Assuming that is true I will renounce any Canadian citizenship .
Nothing against Canada , but I 'm an American by birth and as a US senator I believe I should be only an American . """
2014-01-30,"America 's war on drugs took a major step toward ceasefire on Thursday , as a bipartisan group of senators voted to move forward with the first substantial cut in mandatory minimum sentences , and as the Justice Department made it known that President Obama is looking to commute the sentences of more existing prisoners .
Legislation proposing dramatic reductions in federal prison terms for non - violent drug offenders , and an end to the hundred - fold disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentencing advanced through the Senate judiciary committee by a vote of 13 to five .
The support of a number of right - wing Republicans , including Rand Paul , Mike Lee and Ted Cruz â€ “ who joined as a last - minute co - sponsor â€ “ gives significant momentum to a full Senate vote on the bill , which is mirrored by a House proposal from Republican Raul Labrador and Democrat Bobby Scott .
Action in Congress follows a call by Attorney General Eric Holder in August for a new approach to the war on drugs , which began in the early 1970s and has left the US with 25 % of the world 's prisoners .
Holder also took steps to help prosecutors avoid triggering mandatory sentences , and the US sentencing commission is reviewing its guidelines for judges , but both acknowledge that meaningful reform requires a change in the law .
Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin , a co - sponsor of the bill , known as the Smarter Sentencing Act , said it would help tackle a 500 % increase in the federal prison population since the early 1980s , half of whom are drug offenders .
â€œIt has been 30 years since we reviewed some of these laws , â€ � he said .
â€œThere has also been a 1,100 % increase in spending on incarceration.â€ �
The bill , which was introduced by Durbin and judiciary committee chair Patrick Leahy , cuts some mandatory minimum sentences by more than half , gives judges greater discretion to exempt individual cases , and will allow parole hearings to redress a gulf between crack and powder cocaine punishments that has often meant harsher sentences for African - American drug users than white ones .
The vote came as the Justice Department took the unusual step of asking defence lawyers to recommend clients serving long drug sentences for future presidential pardons .
Deputy attorney general James Cole told a meeting of the New York state bar association , â€œThis is where you can help.â€ � Obama recently commuted the sentences of eight non - violent crack cocaine offenders , and Cole 's speech suggests more presidential action may be pending .
Though only the first step towards making the legislation law , the billâ€ ™
s passage through the judiciary committee was greeted enthusiastically by campaigners for sentencing reform .
â€œThe tide has turned against punitive drug policies that destroy lives and tear families apart , â€œ said Bill Piper , director of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance .
â€œFrom liberal stalwarts to Tea Party favourites thereâ€ ™ s now consensus that our country incarcerates too many people , for too much time , at too much expense to taxpayers.â€
�
But the obstacles ahead also became clear as several Democrats expressed concern about aspects of the bill , including New York Senator Chuck Schumer , who said he was worried that reducing mandatory sentences for lower level offenders could make it harder for prosecutors to force them to testify against gang leaders .
â€œI am voting to move this bill out [ of committee ] but I have some reservations ,
â€ � he said .
â€œThe change to lower end sentencing could be dangerous to crime fighting.â€
�
Republican Chuck Grassley also claimed the bill could increase , rather than decrease , racial disparity in prison sentencing by giving judges more discretion .
â€œA lack of mandatory minimums [ in the past ] led to some judges who were far too lenient , â€ � he told the committee .
Drug sentencing reforms are backed by most law enforcement groups , but the National Association of Assistant US Attorneys broke ranks shortly before the vote with a letter opposing the bill .
â€œWe do not join with those who regard our federal system of justice as â€˜brokenâ€ ™ or in need of major reconstruction , â€ �
it said .
â€œInstead , we consider the current federal mandatory minimum sentence framework as well - constructed and well worth preserving.â€ � Testifying before the committee on Wednesday , Holder reiterated his call for Congress to take the lead and said he was looking forward to working with Senators Leahy and Paul to push legislation forward .
â€œAs part of the ' smart on crime ' approach , I mandated a significant change to the Justice Departmentâ€ ™ s charging policies to ensure that people accused of certain low - level federal drug crimes will face sentences appropriate to their individual conduct â€ “ and that stringent mandatory minimum sentences will be reserved for the most serious criminals , â€ �
he said .
â€œAlongside other important reforms , this change will make our criminal justice system not only fairer , but also more efficient .
And it will complement proposals like the bipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act , introduced by Senators Dick Durbin and Mike Lee , which would give judges more discretion in determining appropriate sentences for people convicted of certain federal drug crimes.â€ �"
2014-02-13,"The Tea Party - aligned senator Mike Lee has defended a controversial decision to force Republican leaders into an embarrassing vote on the debt limit â€ “ a vote that provided ammunition to conservative primary challengers .
Rightwing challengers to Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn , the two most senior Republicans in the Senate , on Thursday pounced on the fact that the duo aided the passage of legislation to increase the Treasuryâ€ ™ s borrowing capacity .
But the action by McConnell and Cornyn was only required because of a procedural motion insisted upon by the Texas senator Ted Cruz .
Without the Cruz manoeuvre , the debt limit bill could have passed with only Democrat votes .
Lee told the Guardian that he backed the move by Cruz , even though it forced McConnell and Cornyn into politically embarrassing votes .
Lee insisted that procedural differences in the GOP are â€œnothing newâ€ � .
The bill had already passed the Republican - controlled House on Tuesday , after what amounted to a capitulation by Republicans to the White House , which had refused to negotiate over a bill that needed to be passed to avoid a potentially calamitous default on US debt .
Republican leaders such as McConnell and Cornyn wanted to give consent for the final Senate vote to be held swiftly , allowing Democrats to pass the bill and minimising further embarrassment to the party .
But that course of action was impeded when the staunchly conservative Cruz threatened to use a filibuster to prevent the legislation from progressing .
In doing so , Cruz effectively insisted upon a procedural motion known as â€œclotureâ€ � , which expedites a bill â€ “ but only when there is the support of 60 senators .
For a dramatic 35 minutes on Wednesday , it seemed the vote for cloture , which required Republican support to meet the 60-vote threshold , might not pass .
Top GOP senators were then forced to grit their teeth and vote for cloture , a move several knew would be used against them in forthcoming primary challenges .
The final vote to increase the debt limit was then passed by the Democrat - controlled Senate 55 - 43 , straight down party lines .
In an interview with the Guardian on Thursday , Lee intimated he might also have blocked passage of the debt bill , saying he was unwilling to give his consent to allow Democrats to quickly usher it through .
â€œI was not going to vote for cloture , â€ � he said .
â€œBecause
I was not willing to vote for cloture , I was not willing to give unanimous consent to avoid a cloture â€ “ because I tend to see those as the same thing.â€ �
He added : â€œThere are differences within the Republican party .
Differences of opinion over what approach procedurally to take in connection with a particular vote , and there are also some policy differences .
But that is nothing new.â€ �
Although a Tea Party - backed figure often characterised as a sidekick to Cruz , Lee is a more nuanced , constructive force in the Senate .
Lee has spent recent months embracing policies to address poverty , including some , such as a renewed emphasis on rehabilitation in the prison system , that have drawn alliances with Democrats .
The Utah senator , who along with Cruz helped orchestrate Octoberâ€ ™ s 16-day government shutdown , which was bound up with another confrontation over the debt limit , said a conservative reform agenda , focused on middle- and low - income Americans , could bridge what he accepted was a â€œdivideâ€ � in the party .
â€œThere is a natural tension that tends to exist between a partyâ€ ™ s base and its elected political leaders , â€ � Lee said .
â€œThat tension has created what some have described as a hole within the Republican party.â€ � However , the internecine warfare engulfing the party was immediately laid bare on Thursday , when Republicans rightwingers seeking to unseat McConnell , the minority leader , and Cornyn , his chief whip , seized on their votes the previous night .
â€œThis latest debt ceiling increase , passed with no spending concessions , is financially reckless , â€ � said Matt Bevin , who had launched a challenge against McConnell for the Republican nomination in Kentucky .
â€œAs
Kentuckyâ€ ™ s
US senator , I would vote against cloture on this bill and I would actively voice my opposition to this bill itself .
True leadership is demanded at a time like this.â€ �
A mock - up check , published by Bevin under the Twitter hashtag # MitchsBlankCheck , taunted the GOP leader and was made payable to Obama for â€œspecial interests and pet projectsâ€ � .
McConnell holds a comfortable lead over Bevin , but there is concern that a bruising primary encounter with a Tea Party opponent will make the Senate minority leader more vulnerable .
A recent poll found McConnell is effectively neck - and - neck with his Democratic primary challenger , Kentucky secretary of state Alison Lundergan Grimes .
But GOP leaders believe special interest groups on the right are to blame for splitting the party over the issue and are planning a concerted fightback against several conservative campaign groups backing primary challengers , according to party officials speaking privately last week .
Heritage Action , the leading advocacy group targeting the leadership , urged senators to block the debt extension and threatened that it would negatively score any Republicans supporting its passage .
â€œRemember
all those debt limit fights ?
Well , apparently Congress got tired of fighting .
So now theyâ€ ™ re working toward doing away with the debt limit altogether , â€ � wrote Amy Payne on a Heritage blog on Thursday .
In recent years , conservatives fought to get at least some spending cuts , to begin putting the budget on a path to balance , â€ � she added .
â€œBut not this year .
No one put up a fight this time.â€ �
However , the decision to force a procedural vote on Wednesday harmed several leading Republicans , including Cornyn , who faces a tough primary challenge in Texas .
Tea Party favourite Steve Stockman said he had been â€œswamped in messages from folks saying theyâ€ ™ re no longer supporting Cornynâ€ � after the cloture vote .
â€œJohn Cornyn switched his vote to oppose you , â€ � wrote Stockman in another tweet reminding supporters that early primary voting started from next week .
â€œWhy not switch yours to oppose him?â€ �"
2014-02-19,"Heâ€ ™ s the Tea Party darling with an impeccably conservative voting record , known in Washington as the right - hand man to Ted Cruz , the uncompromising Texas senator who infuriated mainstream Republicans by bringing the federal government to a halt last year .
Yet in the months since senator Mike Lee helped Cruz orchestrate the shutdown , Lee has been on a quiet mission to rebrand his image and , by association , that of the radical Republican wing he represents .
â€œFew have done more to burn ideological bridges within the GOP , â€ � said Michael Gerson , the former chief speechwriter for president George W Bush , who has noted the shift .
â€œYet no one from the Tea Party side is now doing more to construct them.â€
�
The cause Lee believes will help build bridges among Republicans ?
Combating poverty .
â€œThere is a natural tension that tends to exist between a partyâ€ ™ s base and its elected political leaders , â€ �
Lee said in recent interview with the Guardian .
â€œThat tension has created what some have described as a hole within the Republican party.â€ �
â€œBut I think that hole is exactly the size and shape of a conservative reform agenda â€ “ one that focuses on economic opportunity and upward mobility , one that focuses on fighting poverty and helping the middle class.â€ �
He added : â€œThis is one of the things that can help bridge that gap , that can help fill that hole.â€ � Tackling poverty may seem a counter - intuitive agenda for one of the most conservative figures in Congress , least of all one who claims to want to heal wounds in the Republican party .
But he is not the only top Republican figure to lay out a manifesto for dealing with inequality , an issue many believe needs to be addressed to counter the populist Democratic campaigns expected in this yearâ€ ™ s midterm elections .
A host of other Republicans , including Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor in the House , and Marco Rubio in the Senate , have done the same .
But arguably none have been as committed to the cause in recent months as Lee , who declared a â€œwar on povertyâ€ � last November .
Vanessa Williamson , a Harvard academic who co - wrote a book on the Tea Party , said the GOP may be realising it needs to moderate its message , even if the policies remains trenchantly conservative .
â€œMany people in the Republican Party have noticed that extreme tactics havenâ€ ™ t been working very well for them lately , â€ �
she said .
â€œThey went to the mat on a number of government shutdown - type approaches - the absolute non - compromise tactical position .
But I think there is less disagreement on the policy goals , which tend to remain relatively extreme.â€ �
Lee is arguably a case in point .
While he may have adopted a traditionally liberal cause his prescriptions are rooted in firmly conservative ground .
In his view , government causes poverty , and has little hope of alleviating the problem .
Only the enabling power of a free - market economy , aided by a civic voluntary sector , higher rates of marriage , and more considered spending , will improve social mobility .
His latest contribution was a bill , introduced last week , that would restore a work requirement for recipients of food stamps that was first introduced by president Bill Clinton in 1996 .
Joshua Smith , a senior policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal thinktank , described the measure as â€œcompletely backwards logicâ€ � , because it wrongly assumes there are swaths of unemployed people who would work if only they were given a nudge .
â€œIn fact , it pretty clear the problem is a lack of labor demand , â€ � he said .
Smith is even more scathing of another proposal contained in Leeâ€ ™ s bill : capping means - tested welfare spending at 2007 levels , a move the senator says will save $ 2.5tn .
The reduction would be adjusted for inflation , phased in over three years , and only come into force when unemployment is below 6 % .
But it still constitutes a dramatic reduction on government money spent on the poor â€ “ distorting a budget that ordinarily rises and falls depending on the performance of the economy .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t make sense , â€ � Smith said .
â€œIt can only hurt the most vulnerable people.â€ �
Asked who would bear the burden of the massive welfare cut , Lee was non - committal . â€œIt would have to be worked out between the various state programs , in figuring out how they are going to do more with less money , â€ � he said .
In his speech before the rightwing Heritage Foundation in November , Lee did not mention plans to suck such large sums out of the food stamps program .
Instead , he acknowledge the US was â€œthird from the bottomâ€ � among advanced countries in terms of upward social mobility , emphasising the need to help underprivileged schools .
Lee made no mention of deficit reduction or out - of - control government spending â€ “ a curious omission given his central role in the shutdown â€ “ and even went so far as to tell the audience : â€œJust as we can not spend our way out of poverty , we can not really cut our way out , either.â€ � All of which has some critics questioning whether Lee has merely been engaging in a rebranding exercise .
â€œThe senator is just talking the talk , â€ � said one GOP insider .
â€œHe has an image problem heâ€ ™ s trying to fix.â€ �
In his Heritage speech , Lee appeared to advocate a subtle shift away from the conservative obsession with same - sex marriage , saying the GOPâ€ ™ s focus should instead be on the economic advantages of marriage more broadly â€ “ something Lee said was strongly supported by research .
â€œIn an earlier era , our assumptions and vocabulary might have expressed judgment instead of compassion , and closed doors instead of opening them , â€ � he said .
â€œThough the foundational importance of family has not changed â€ “ times and attitudes
have.â€
�
However , four months later , Lee has chosen to return to that same same - sex marriage debate with vigour , introducing a bill with Cruz that would effectively reverse the gains same - sex couples have made since a favourable supreme court decision last year .
There is perhaps one issue on which , by all accounts , Lee can not be accused of a disconnect between his match rhetoric and actions .
The senatorâ€ ™ s push for reform of the criminal justice system , a drive he launched last summer , places him on firmly liberal - libertarian terrain .
He believes America puts too many people in prison for too long , and has introduced a bill with Dick Durbin , the second - ranking Democrat in the Senate , to significantly reduce the sentences given to non - violent offenders .
Lee says he wants more rehabilitation and less punishment .
When it was pointed out that he was advocating a traditionally Democratic position â€ “ one at odds with most Republicans â€ “
he replied : â€œTo an extent , that is true â€
¦
I think that needs to change .
I think that there is a real opportunity here for conservatives to go beyond merely protesting against the government they donâ€ ™ t want , and move in the direction of the kind of government they do want.â€ �"
2014-03-04,"Only in Texas , perhaps â€ “ and maybe only this year â€ “ could there be a Republican primary race in which a man whoâ€ ™ s been rated as the second - most conservative US senator is criticised for being too liberal .
Itâ€ ™ s an odd thing to see , but thanks , in part , to Senator Ted Cruz , it is also emblematic of the dynamic that has driven the campaigns in this yearâ€ ™ s GOP primaries in Texas , which culminate in voting on Tuesday .
John Cornyn , the Senate minority whip , is seeking his partyâ€ ™ s nomination on Tuesday to run for a third term .
The National Journal named him 2012â€ ™ s second - most conservative senator .
He has received top marks from the anti - abortion group National Right to Life and the National Rifle Association .
Unlike Cruz , though , Cornyn was not in favour of trying to defund Obamacare by provoking a government shutdown .
And in the current climate , any hint of compromise or moderate behaviour is unpalatable to the Republican far right .
So Cornyn , whoâ€ ™ d been regarded as safe , faced a Tea Party looking to take him out .
He will almost certainly hold on to his seat , but not without fending off a number of challengers â€ “ including , most prominently among them , the unlikely congressman Steve Stockman , whoâ€ ™
s run an attention - getting but bizarre race in which heâ€ ™ s tried to beat Cornyn by getting to his right .
Last month , Cruz refused to endorse Cornyn for re - election .
That was consistent with the anti - establishment , subversive stance that carried Cruz into the Senate and sent shockwaves through Texas politics .
While Cruzâ€ ™ s tactics have made him a deeply divisive and controversial figure among members of his own party in Washington , the senatorâ€ ™ s
belligerent style has become a blueprint for Republican candidates in Texas .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the Ted Cruz phenomenon â€
“
you have Cruz opening the gate to a challenge on the right to established conservative politicians such as David Dewhurst , â€ � said Brandon Rottinghaus , associate political science professor at the University of Houston .
Cruz beat the well - funded Dewhurst in a 2012 Senate campaign , galvanising Tea Party support by painting himself as a fire - breathing underdog scrapping against a moderate establishment figure .
Since then Texas Republicans have â€ “ even more than usual â€ “ lurched to the right , and pledging to battle the Obama administration at every opportunity has become a leitmotif even for those running for a state office in which they might never have to contend with any national issues .
( The candidates are free to do this because they donâ€ ™ t have to worry about winning the centre in a general election â€ “ in most cases , winning the Republican primary is a virtual guarantee of success in November . )
Contenders spent heavily on advertisements and attacked each other with gusto .
One engaged a private investigator who discovered that a rivalâ€ ™ s now - defunct sports bar apparently hired an illegal immigrant in the 1980s .
Coupled with the Cruz effect is the mood of uncertainty and opportunity created by the imminent departure of an entrenched , dominant figure .
After a state - record 14 years as governor , Rick Perry opted not to run for another term , and may mount a second bid for the presidency .
Perryâ€ ™ s exit is prompting turnover as candidates jostle for jobs .
Of the top six state political positions up for grabs , Dewhurst , the lieutenant governor , is the sole incumbent running to keep his job .
But there is little diversity in the make - up of the candidates for the leading roles , who are overwhelmingly male and white in a â€œminority - majorityâ€ � state .
Despite constant talk that Texasâ€ ™ changing demographics will make the state winnable for the Democrats in future years , there is no sense in this campaign that Republicans are adapting their messages .
â€œFor this cycle for sure the Republicans have made their bed .
They donâ€ ™ t have any plans to appeal to crossover voters , to Latino voters , â€ � said Rottinghaus .
Some of the most serious challenges facing Texas , including water infrastructure , access to healthcare , poverty , pollution and transportation , have attracted scant attention .
Instead , much debate has centered around hot - button issues that are more about national politics than local , such as abortion , same - sex marriage and illegal immigration .
Glenn Hegar , a state senator , is running for comptroller .
Earlier this year , he released a 63-second video called â€œFreedomâ€ � .
Set in a shooting range , it trumpets his endorsement by the NRA and shows him firing a handgun and an automatic rifle .
It is not clear how unstinting support for the Second Amendment would be useful should he become the stateâ€ ™ s chief financial officer .
The four candidates for the second - most important state role , lieutenant governor , have all leaned far to the right and there is little to distinguish their attitudes on the highest - profile issues .
They took much the same positions in an hour - long televised debate in January .
They were asked about Marlise Munoz , a brain - dead pregnant woman from Fort Worth who was kept on life support against the wishes of her family .
All four felt that the judge erred when he ordered the hospital to stop treatment .
â€œThis baby could have been born , â€ � said Dewhurst , even though the hospital conceded in court that the fetus was â€œnot viableâ€ � .
Each candidate said that abortion is not acceptable even in cases of rape and incest .
â€œRape and incest are not legitimate exceptions in my opinion , â€ � said Jerry Patterson , who is Land Commissioner .
â€œEither it is life or itâ€ ™ s not .
And to say that we have an unborn child that is the result of a rape and somehow thatâ€ ™ s less lifelike or inferior to a life that was through a natural , non - catastrophic event like that doesnâ€ ™ t make any sense.â€ �
All support the teaching of creationism in public schools .
â€œWhen it comes to creationism , not only should it be taught , it should be triumphed , heralded , â€ � said Dan Patrick .
He is the chairman of the state Senate Education Committee .
As for gun control : â€œThe one [ public ] venue that I believe that maybe handguns
shouldnâ€ ™ t be there , although it kind of enhances the quality of the service , is a bar .
Thatâ€ ™ s about it for me , â€ � said Patterson .
â€œA citizen who can not carry a firearm is not much of a citizen , frankly heâ€ ™ s a serf.â€ �
A University of Texas / Texas Tribune poll taken last month put Dewhurst ahead with 37 % and Patrick second with 31 % , suggesting there could be a two - man run - off in May.
As for Cornyn , heâ€ ™ s expected to win with ease .
Stockman , whoâ€ ™ s received the most coverage of all of Cornynâ€ ™ s challengers , has run a campaign that can only be described as strange â€ “ heâ€ ™ s raised little money , held few events , appeared to go AWOL for several weeks and has in general been so ineffectual that local Tea Party members disowned him .
Still , his Twitter feed has been busy .
The favourite to replace Perry as governor , Greg Abbott , has so far run a careful campaign that has avoided such bombast , though Abbott , who is currently the stateâ€ ™ s attorney general , drew criticism for campaigning with the musician Ted Nugent , whose long history of offensive comments includes calling President Obama a â€œsubhuman mongrelâ€ � and people who use food stamps â€œwell - fed ... cocksuckersâ€ � .
While Nugent made a quarter - hearted apology , Abbott and other prominent Republicans have not made serious attempts to distance themselves from him .
Abbott is expected to face Wendy Davis , who is set to be confirmed as the Democratic candidate for governor in that partyâ€ ™ s primary on Tuesday .
Should Davis inspire a strong performance from the Democrats in November , do not expect a move towards the centre ground that might reduce the rancor and calm the bluster .
â€œIf
the Democrats become more competitive itâ€ ™ ll probably make polarisation worse , â€ � said Rottinghaus .
â€œAs
both parties play to their base
itâ€ ™ s probably just going to get worse .
Itâ€ ™ s going to be a long - standing problem for the state.â€ �"

2014-03-09,"For a second consecutive year , Senator Rand Paul won the Conservative Political Action Conference 's straw poll for 2016 presidential candidates .
It was n't even close .
Paul finished ahead of Texas Senator Ted Cruz by a 20 % margin , winning 31 % of the 2,459 votes cast .
Retired neurosurgeon Dr Ben Carson finished third with 9 % .
The New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , who was n't invited to speak last year for supposed heresies to the conversative movement , came in fourth with 8 % .
Florida Senator Marco Rubio , second with 23 % last year , finished far back at 6 % after a year in which his work on comprehensive immigration reform alienated many conservatives .
Paul , the junior senator from Kentucky , once again capitalized on a strong conference representation from student organizations and the libertarian faithful who in years past came to boost his father , former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul .
Unlike his father , however , the younger Paul is considered a viable candidate when the 2016 primary season begins â€ “ not just a protest figure .
Paul 's victory can not just be pinned to the typically libertarian - skewed audience , though .
Certain libertarian beliefs that only a few years ago would have been considered fringe by the mainstream party are now open to discussion .
The conference featured several healthy debates about appropriating traditionally liberal ideas : criminal justice reform and the elimination of mandatory minimum prison sentences ; marijuana legalization and a pullback on the 40-year - old war on drugs ; and reform of the national security state 's surveillance apparatus .
Even as recently as the George W Bush administration , Republicans who espoused these ideas would have been labeled soft on crime , stoners or enablers of terrorism , respectively .
By this year , they had the backing of high - profile conservative figures like Texas Governor Rick Perry , anti - tax enforcer Grover Norquist and , of course , Senator Paul .
The reformers pushing for these ideas did so under the mantle of expanding personal liberty and shrinking the size of government .
Expanding personal liberty , in all its forms , was at the heart of Paul 's standing - room - only speech on Friday afternoon .
Paul took on the CPAC crowd 's two great enemies in equal doses : the Democratic party and the Republican establishment .
"" I do n't question President Obama 's motives , "" he said in lambasting the administration 's regulatory policies and defense of a robust surveillance state , "" but history will remember his timid defense of liberty . ""
In perhaps the biggest applause line of the conference , Paul declared : "" If you have a cell phone , you are under surveillance .
I believe what you do on your cell phone is none of their damn business . ""
As for fellow members of his party , Paul advised discretion in selecting candidates .
"" You might think I 'm talking about electing Republicans ; I 'm not , "" he said .
"" I 'm talking about electing friends of liberty . ""
The straw poll results were announced at the end of a mostly quiet last day at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor , Maryland , a few miles outside Washington .

2014-03-10,"Democratic Senators preparing to lead an all - nighter of climate speeches on Monday admitted a climate change bill would collapse in todayâ€ ™ s Congress â€ “ but said they hoped to prime the politics for 2015 and the 2016 presidential race .
More than two dozen Democratic Senators signed on to participate in an all - night session of speeches on climate change which was scheduled to run from about 6.30pm on Monday night to the start of the working day on Tuesday .
It is not a filibuster , unlike Septemberâ€ ™ s marathon speech against Obamacare by the Texas Republican Ted Cruz .
The senators conceded that a climate bill in this Congress would almost certainly fail .
â€œTonight is not about a specific legislative proposal , â€ � said Sheldon Whitehouse , from Rhode Island and one of the leaders of the speech marathon .
â€œWe have got a little bit more work to do to open up the political space on this .
I think if we want immediately to a vote we wouldnâ€
™ t be successful , â€ �
he told a conference call with reporters .
â€œIf we make this an issue in 2014 , if we make this a debate that Republican presidential candidates have to address , I think we can do that.â€
�
For the moment , however , Whitehouse conceded : â€œIt would be premature.â€ �
Instead , the senators said they planned to spend much of Monday night calling out Republicans in Congress as climate deniers , using the high - visibility moment to help create the political space needed to get a bill rolling .
The senators also indicated they would be calling out Republicans for their connections to the conservative oil - billionaire Koch brothers .
Such assertiveness on climate change represents a big change for Democrats , the senators said .
Climate change was a toxic issue in Congress after 2010 , when the last attempt at a climate bill died in the Senate .
Since then the White House , Obama administration officials and members of Congress have fallen silent on the issue while Republicans have taken up opposition to climate regulations as a core part of conservative ideology .
The Democratic senators said that era was over .
President Barack Obama made climate change one of the top priorities of his second term ; secretary of state John Kerry last week adopted climate change as his signature issue ; and the Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to national security .
There is also more willingness among Democrats in the Senate to address climate change .
Harry Reid , the Senate majority leader , last week defined climate change as the worst problem facing the world today .
Climate change was seen as a decisive factor in recent Democratic victories in the Senate and in the Virginia gubernatorial race .
Arguably most importantly , it has become an important issue for some big Democratic donors .
The former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer , for example , has pledged to spend up to $ 100 m in the 2014 mid - term elections to support candidates who support action on climate change .
The senators said they hoped eventually to get energy - state Democrats on board , and win back Republicans such as Lindsey Graham and John McCain who had supported climate change legislation in the past .
It will however be an uphill climb .
A majority of Republicans in Congress deny the existence of climate change or oppose action on it , according to the Center for American Progress ( CAP ) .
The CAP said 56 % of Republicans in the House and 65 % in the Senate either deny the existence of a human role in climate change or oppose action .
Despite newfound assertion from the White House , many Democrats are still wary of coming out in favour of climate - change regulations .
About half of Democrats in the Senate were staying away from Monday nightâ€ ™ s session .
They included senators from energy - rich states and those fighting close re - election battles .
â€œItâ€ ™ s important to build this as an opening salvo , â€ � said Martin Heinrich , of New Mexico ."
2014-04-08,"Republicans have finally found an edgy and provocative voice in an outsider artist who goes by the name Sabo .
His art is also unrepentantly racist , misogynistic and homophobic .
On Monday , the hugely influential Breitbart.com smugly promoted Sabo 's freelance advertising campaign for its site .
It included , among other startling images , Nancy Pelosi in this explicitly pornographic pose of Miley Cyrus , complete with lascivious action and prominent ass
: We talk about a Republican "" war on women "" , and the GOP has floundered in its response .
The party has been sifting through its ideological wreckage for a solution to its demographic disadvantage .
Conservative pundits dredge up the party 's abolitionist history to justify why black voters should turn their way ; they argue that women need to support gun - rights candidates on personal safety grounds .
They 've been stymied , for the most part , in how to appeal to young people .
The most visible gambits have played on macho , reckless bad - assery : James O'Keefe 's scripted and self - interested stunt - exposes , the smirking listicles of Breitbart columnist Ben Shapiro .
Even Rand Paul 's flip libertarianism , by far the most successful version of this bro - sploitation approach , has the flavor of a cigar - smoke - filled Throwback Thursday fratboy confab :
Last week , a panel of conservative women agreed that the party 's lagging support among women was not a function of a "" women problem "" but a "" marriage problem "" : "" Everybody go out , right now , go get married if youâ€ ™ re not married ... and we should be able to solve all these problems . ""
Said another : "" It is the decline of marriage that is the lodestar for why peopleâ€ ™ s voting behavior is what it is . ""
The group , put together by the Heritage Foundation , agreed that on a solution : single women need to stop being single women .
Sabo 's art makes the assertion that women are n't people , and Breitbart passed along that assertion .
Sabo 's iconography may be draw from Cyrus , but to put a woman who did n't choose to pose that way into that position is a form of virtual sexual assault .
This is very much like when Hustler decided to demean columnist SE Cupp in an even more vulgar form .
Conservatives were justifiably aghast : When I flexed some outrage muscle on Twitter about the Pelosi image and Breitbart 's role , the general response was predictable and disappointing .
Among the flashes of decency ( see here ) , most simply pointed to the Cupp image , among others , and said : "" The left does it , too . ""
I could quibble with that .
Breitbart is not Hustler , for instance .
Or at least I do n't think Breitbart wants to be Hustler .
Hustler is not really in the business of trying to get an out - of - power political party back into the thick of the national conversation .
Hustler is not trying to attract the support of female voters .
Sabo , on the other hand , may well be a progressive plant .
Beyond the Pelosi image , he 's also produced posters proclaiming "" Fags = the new nigger . ""
( He gave credit for the slogan to an unidentified Prop 8 protester : "" Blame him . "" )
Promote his work hard enough and Pelosi can laugh all the way back to the Speaker 's chair .
I understand the reluctance of mainstream voices to shun Sabo 's work .
His graffiti- and pop culture - inspired posters have an angry inflection that meshes with Tea Party concerns , but with a sly wit that conjures a more desirable demographic than the grandma - forwarding - emails feel of the Hannity and Limbaugh set .
No less a figure than movement darling Sen Ted Cruz has embraced Sabo 's brash imagery .
When a poster appeared last month , imposing Cruz 's face onto a casually aggressive pose reminiscent of the Latino gang members , Cruz signed one : "" The fight for liberty never ends . ""
On April Foolsâ€ ™ Day , Cruz temporarily adopted the poster 's addition of a Winston Churchill tattoo .
Grasping at hipster iconography and attempts to refashion existing conservative tendencies is a big turn inward , not outreach .
It 's a conversation happening squarely within the Republican party â€ “ within one gender within the party .
It all but guarantees the GOP 's downward trend into irrelevance .
Republicans can blame the media all they want .
( I actually agree that the mainstream press covers outbursts of conservative extremism more lustily than it does the missteps of liberal activists . )
But the very conviction that the right does n't get a fair shake should n't make it easier to accept the ugliness at the fringes .
If you believe you 're being held to higher standard than your opponent , the solution is never to sink to their level .
The argument that "" the other side does it "" is only a defense if you think such insulting discourse gives the other side an unfair advantage .
Do conservatives really believe that ?
Do they think so little of the independents and single - women - who - should - get - married ?
Do they want to live in a country where that 's the case ?
If we 're going to re - civilize the conversation , someone has to go first .
This is not about being the thought police .
This is about deciding who your allies are .
Thinking bad thoughts , creating art that upsets people : I am for that .
Just do n't give a platform to someone just because he makes you giggle .
All this is to say , guys , you have to do something about this asshole .
Call me a concern troll if you want ; call me a hypocrite .
I 've certainly made my share of Palin jokes and vulgar asides .
Advice from a political opponent is cheap , and I 'd put teeth into my suggestion if I could .
I 'll stop writing columns if the right begins to shun all the sexism that creeps out along the margins .
I 'll retire into a life of kitten pictures and hot yoga if they split the make - up of their leadership fifty - fifty along gender lines .
Someone show me where to sign ."
2014-04-12,"Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz were among several potential Republican White House contenders to gather in New Hampshire on Saturday , for a conference seen by some observers as marking the unofficial beginning of the state 's 2016 presidential selection process .
New Hampshire is known as the â€œfirst in the nationâ€ � state , due to the timing of the staging of its four - yearly presidential primary .
Paul , Cruz and the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , who ran for the Republican nomination in 2008 , were among the scheduled speakers at the Manchester event , which is hosted by the conservative groups Citizens United and Americans for Prosperity .
Other speakers at the "" Freedom Summit "" included the real estate mogul Donald Trump , the former House speaker Newt Gingrich ( a 2012 candidate ) and the New Hampshire senator Kelly Ayotte .
Paul â€ “ who last month said he was â€œdefinitelyâ€
� considering a run in 2016 , used his speech to say conservatives needed a bold message to "" hit those who have n't been listening "" and to keep their political movement growing .
The senator from Kentucky said the GOP could not be "" the party of fat cats , rich guys and Wall Streetâ€ � and said conservatives must carry messages of justice , concern for unemployed workers and against government surveillance if they want to attract new people to the movement , including young people , Hispanics and blacks .
He added that the conservative movement had never been about rich people or privilege , and said : "" We are the middle class.â€ � Americans for Prosperity , which is affiliated with the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch , has spent millions of dollars on healthcare - related attack ads aimed at Democratic senators in New Hampshire , North Carolina , Alaska , Colorado , Iowa and elsewhere .
Healthcare duly provided a key theme of the New Hampshire event .
"" It 's the unofficial kick - off of the 2016 process , "" said a Republican operative , Mike Biundo , who managed the former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum 's 2012 presidential campaign .
Santorum is touring South Carolina this weekend .
In Manchester , the early speakers attacked the Affordable Care Act , President Barack Obama 's signature legislative achievement which Republicans are making a central issue in their midterm election strategy â€ “ despite reports this week of strong enrolment figures .
Some noted this week 's resignation of the health and human services secretary , Kathleen Sebelius , who presided over the law 's implementation .
Ayotte asked , "" What took so long ? ""
"" I have heard from the people of New Hampshire , and the people of New Hampshire want us to work to repeal this law and replace it with commonsense reforms , "" she said .
Sebelius resigned on Friday , days after the Obama administration announced that enrolment for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act had grown to 7.5 million , a figure that exceeded expectations and gave Democrats a surprise success after a disastrous rollout .
It was welcome news for Democrats , who have been forced to defend their support for the unpopular law .
As potential presidential candidates jockey for position , the stakes are high for the November midterm elections , where Republicans are fighting to claim the Senate majority .
The shift could block Obama 's legislative priorities in the final two years of his presidency .
A Democratic National Committee spokesman , Mike Czin , noted that Republican opposition to the healthcare law was the foundation of an unsuccessful political strategy in 2012 .
He said that the debate had changed now the law had been implemented and millions of people were enjoying its benefits .
"" That 's a debate that we 're going to have , and we 're eager to have , "" Czin said .
Representative Chris Van Hollen , who leads House Democrats ' campaign efforts , called for Republicans to defend their support for a GOP budget plan introduced this week that would repeal the healthcare law , transform Medicare , reintroduce the "" doughnut hole "" for prescription drug costs and enact deep cuts in education .
"" Republicans in Iowa and New Hampshire are supporting an agenda that hurts middle - class families , hurts women and will benefit billionaires like the Koch brothers , "" Van Hollen said ."
2014-06-03,"Ted Cruz is riding high right now .
Over the weekend , he gave a rousing anti - establishment speech at the activist - oriented Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans , and won the event 's straw poll .
He also appeared on ABC 's This Week to give a cathartic Hillary Clinton smack - down : "" The sad thing with Secretary Clinton , is it seems to be all politics , all the time . ""
Most significantly , the Texas GOP primaries gave the Tea Party and Cruz an important series of victories at a time when the insurgent movement 's electoral future seems otherwise uncertain â€ “ even and especially in this weekâ€ ™ s Super Tuesday primaries in Mississippi and elsewhere .
The person who should be the happiest about Ted Cruz 's visibility and apparent success ?
Rand Paul .
The more Cruz links himself to the Tea Party and basks in national attention , the more reasonable and mature Paul looks â€ “ and the less he has to tone down his own extreme positions .
Cruz and Paul are the only two possible 2016 candidates with the infrastructure and fundraising abilities that could plausibly challenge what used to be Chris Christie 's advantage , which is looking weaker by the day .
Do n't be distracted by straw polls .
Crowd size says more about notoriety and entertainment value than political support ( n.b .
Palin , S ; Bachmann , M ) .
The key indicator for the Cruz - Paul matchup , at this ultra - early stage , is found in state head - to - head polls against Clinton : in the most recent polls from Iowa and North Carolina , Paul is the GOP nominee who comes the closest to besting Clinton â€ “ beating not just Cruz but Christie and Jeb Bush , too .
In New Hampshire and Colorado , he 's the only Republican that can beat her .
Cruz 's heightened national profile has come with steady negative favorability ratings
â€ “ in fact , he 's never had a net positive favorability rating nationwide .
Even more perilously , the feedback loop of Tea Party adoration always pushes Cruz 's rhetoric into ever - more - fanciful flights of extremism .
In March , he accused pro - choice advocates of being Satanists ; last month , he cribbed Jack Nicholson 's firey "" A Few Good Men "" retort in the context of a Benghazi debate , saying Democrats "" ca n't handle the truth .
"" It 's a great line â€
“
it 's also the point in the movie at which it becomes clear that Nicholson 's character has confused patriotism with a blank check to commit atrocities .
Cruz 's considerable ego flourishes in the spotlight , while Paul has a cagier â€ “ and more wonkily sedate â€ “ approach to grandstanding .
Search the internet for wacky Rand Paul quotes .
He puts his most right - wing proposals in deceptively simple language : framing the elimination of Social Security , for instance , as "" I think the average American is smart enough to make their own investments . ""
His other gaffes are in support of libertarian ideas that sound weird only in the context of being a Republican in 2014 : "" I think torture is always wrong , "" for instance , or saying he would have voted against invading Iraq .
Itâ€ ™ s not that Paul doesnâ€ ™ t like the spotlight , or that gaffe - proofing yourself is the only strategy 889 days before Election Day .
But two showy Senate filibusters last year neatly illustrate the divide : Paul 's was , in fact , a filibuster ; Cruz 's speech was just that â€ “ a long speech , with his fundamental aimlessness betrayed by wildly off - topic soliloquies on everything from White Castle to Ashton Kutcher .
The Cruz bubble is built on a charismatic , if sometimes eccentric , appeal to the most conservative of the conservative base ; Rand 's popularity â€ “ and he came in third in that RLC straw poll
â€ “ has its roots in a few strong policy positions and the ability to not come off like an asshat in public .
He 's also created a new kind of base : outside both ideological orthodoxy and the entrenched establishment .
The irony of Paul benefitting from being the lesser of two crazies is that , in some ways , Paul is actually the more radical of the two , the candidate most likely to pull the GOP from its moorings .
Cruz rails against the party "" graybeards "" , but he is actually a kind of stealth establishment candidate : his radical rhetoric and lack of discipline may upset the party "" graybeards "" , but his positions are logical extensions of the traditional GOP platform .
Paul , on the other hand , is staking out new ground .
His positions do n't completely align with establishment GOP â€ “ nor do they fit the agenda ( such as it is ) of the Tea Party .
He is a Venn diagram of one .
Paul 's libertarianism is unapologetic ; where he 's strayed from GOP orthodoxy , it 's largely in the direction that the American public is going â€ “ and not just his call for National Security Administration oversight ( supported by 59 % of Americans ) .
On marriage equality ( also supported by 59 % of Americans ) , Paul told his party that they need to "" agree to disagree "" .
In contrast , Cruz has introduced a bill that would invalidate the federal benefits of same - sex marriages if the couple moves to a marriage - restricted state â€ “ and he asked listeners to "" pray "" that marriage equality rulings be reversed .
But it 's not just about bending with the popular will .
Paul has staked out positions outside the GOP orthodoxy that are also on the periphery of the average voter 's radar .
He at least admits that the Republican mania for voter ID laws is counter - productive : "" Republicans need to be aware that there is a group of voters that Iâ€ ™ m trying to court and that we should be trying to court who do see it as something directed towards them . ""
Both Paul and Cruz advocate drug sentencing reform , but Paul backs up that gesture with the belief that felons ' voting rights should be reinstated .
Look , Rand Paul is no moderate .
He 's pro - life and another Benghazi alarmist .
He wants to privatize Social Security .
He 's aligned with the National Rifle Association on gun rights .
But he 's not really much of a Republican â€ “ and that 's a good thing , if the GOP wants to survive .
Paul happens to be headed to Texas this week himself ; he 'll speak at the Texas State Republican convention .
People forget that Paul 's Texas roots are just as deep than Cruz 's : his father 's 37-year House career means that Paul was born and raised there .
This is no small thing in a state that takes its identity very seriously .
( That Texas has accepted and elevated a Cruz , a native Canadian , is perhaps the strongest proof of Cruz 's political genius ) .
But 2016 prognosticators should n't pay much attention to how Paul is received â€ “ they should keep an eye on the waves he does n't make .
He could surf those calm waters far ."
2014-08-09,"Rick Perry used the 2011 RedState Gathering conservative convention to announce his ill - fated 2012 presidential bid .
There was no such drama this time around from the man who is stepping down as Texas governor after Novemberâ€ ™ s election .
But he delivered a stentorian , crowd - pleasing and rhetoric - jammed speech on core Republican issues on Friday , doing nothing to counter the impression that he is laying the foundations for a second tilt at the White House .
Perry was praised by Ted Cruz during a speech at the Gathering three years ago , when Cruz was merely a little - known , underdog US senate candidate .
Now a Tea Party superstar , Cruz reiterated his admiration for his â€œfriendâ€ � on Friday night but before long the two may be rivals for the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential campaign .
Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech at the Gathering at a hotel in downtown Fort Worth , Cruz deflected â€ “ but did not dismiss â€ “ questions about whether he was considering a run .
â€œThereâ€ ™ ll be time enough to answer that question , but let me answer it this way
â€
¦
I think Republicans should nominate whoeverâ€ ™ s standing up and leading and fighting the fight , â€ � he said .
â€œBy all accounts there are 10 , 12 , 15 people that seem to be thinking about running .
What I would encourage each and every one of them to do is stand up and lead .
I think itâ€ ™ d be fantastic if a year from now we had five or six or seven Republicans , senators , governors , standing up and leading and making the case that what weâ€ ™ re doing isnâ€ ™ t working and thereâ€ ™ s a better path for America .
And so my focus is on energising and mobilising the grassroots and making the case weâ€ ™ ve got to change our path.â€
�
The 43-year - old had arrived on the podium to whoops and cheers from the crowd and a standing ovation .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s willing to do what must be done for freedom , â€ � Erick Erickson , editor - in - chief of the influential conservative blog RedState.com , said while introducing Cruz .
â€œThe rock star status here , itâ€ ™ s like all the Beatles in one person in the conservative movement.â€
�
A woman told Cruz during a brief question and answer session :
â€œWhen I look at you
I can imagine that youâ€ ™
d be just like one of the founding fathers of this country.â€ �
His speech centred on a half - dozen claimed â€œvictoriesâ€ � over the federal government on issues such as gun control .
At the end , activists bowed their heads as Erickson led the room in a prayer asking God for Cruz to be a â€œbeaconâ€ � for America .
Cruz cited President Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s failure to enact legislation in the wake of the Newtown school massacre as an example of successful conservative resistance to perceived government overreach .
â€œHe used it as an excuse to try to go after our second amendment right to bear arms , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œIn Texas , gun control means : hit what youâ€ ™ re aiming at.â€
�
He claimed that the current influx of unaccompanied minors across the southern border was a result of the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s deferred - action Daca programme .
â€œThis crisis is the direct consequence of President Obamaâ€ ™ s lawlessness , â€ � he said .
The senator argued that â€œ[Senate majority leader ] Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats engaged in naked obstructionismâ€ � to scupper the bill , although others have pointed the finger squarely at Cruz for his unwillingness to compromise .
Cruz predicted the GOP would retake the Senate this year .
â€œObamacare is an albatross hanging over the necks of these Democratic senators â€ ¦ theyâ€ ™ re paying the price ,
â€ � he said .
Despite the popularity of Cruz , and unlike in previous election years , mainstream Republican senators do not seem to be suffering serious consequences from the Tea Partyâ€ ™ s influence on grassroots conservatives .
High - profile right - wingers at the Gathering sought to put a brave face on recent setbacks .
Incumbent Republican senators seeking re - election all held off challenges from Tea Party - backed candidates in this yearâ€ ™ s primaries .
This week , Pat Roberts in Kansas ( aged 78 ) and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee ( 74 ) became the latest to vanquish insurgents in GOP primaries ahead of this autumnâ€ ™ s mid - term elections .
Jim DeMint , president of a leading conservative think tank , the Heritage Foundation , said there has been a ripple effect which has forced moderates farther to the right .
He added that he believes the Tea Party movement will effectively act as a watchdog to ensure that elected representatives do not compromise on conservative values .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to make it harder for them once they get past the general election not to follow through .
Iâ€ ™ m not discouraged at all .
What Iâ€ ™ ve seen â€ ¦ is that spirit of resistance and pushback is actually starting to invade the incumbents there in Washington , â€ � he told the audience .
â€œItâ€ ™ s making a difference and weâ€ ™ ve got to keep up the pressure.â€ �
The dayâ€ ™ s first speaker , Ken Cuccinelli , president of the Senate Conservatives Fund and the defeated candidate in Virginiaâ€ ™ s last gubernatorial election , denied that the groupâ€ ™ s backing of Tea Party candidates has been divisive and a waste of money .
â€œGeorge Washington lost more battles than he won , but he won the war .
This is a long war , â€ � he said .
Perryâ€ ™ s 2012 campaign was more of a brief skirmish .
An early frontrunner , his bid imploded after a high - profile debate gaffe and when his rivals used his support for government - funded tuition for undocumented immigrants to portray him as soft on immigration .
The surge of unaccompanied children crossing the border in the Rio Grande Valley has given Perry a fresh national platform which he has used to condemn the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s handling of the problem .
The likely effectiveness of Perryâ€ ™ s plan to send 1,000 National Guard troops to the border has been questioned in some quarters , but his stance was rapturously received here .
â€œIf
Washington wonâ€
™ t act to secure the border , as governor of Texas
I will , â€ � he said .
Perry met briefly with Obama in Dallas last month to discuss the crisis and the president described the talk as â€œconstructiveâ€ � , but there was nothing conciliatory about the governorâ€ ™ s tone in Fort Worth .
â€œThe root cause of this tragedy in Texas is a border the federal government refuses to secure , â€ � he said .
â€œAs a direct result of
this administrationâ€ ™ s naive policies , poor enforcement , failed leadership ,
weâ€ ™ re now faced with an unnecessary humanitarian crisis.â€ �
Perry used part of his speech to expound on a beloved theme in Texas : the quest for limited federal government and giving more power to states .
â€œThe founders knew that government closest to the people was best , â€ � he said .
â€œThomas Jefferson was right when he said a little rebellion now and then is a good thing .
And now , faced with another power - hungry oppressive ruler in a faraway place , itâ€ ™ s time for us to start a little rebellionâ€ � .
The 64-year - old proposed a â€œwarâ€ � on â€œthe battlefield of ideasâ€ � .
To the delight of the 300-strong crowd , Perry also launched an assault on Obamacare as a prime example of budget - draining federal overreach .
â€œ[Historyâ€ ™ s told us ] what government - run healthcare looks like .
It looks like these long lines and rationing in Britain , â€ � he said .
Perry announced the formation of a new political action committee , RickPAC , which aims to raise funds to boost the election chances of fellow Republicans nationwide in Novemberâ€ ™ s elections , such as Tom Cotton in Arkansas and Steve Daines in Montana .
â€œIn order to win back the Senate this fall Iâ€ ™ ve formed a new PAC to win races from coast to coast , â€ � said Perry .
The PAC , if successful , is likely to enhance Perryâ€ ™ s standing among party members beyond Texas .
Also adding fuel to the speculation about his presidential intent , Perry is scheduled to spend the next few days making his latest trip to Iowa , the location of the first GOP presidential caucus , for the Family Leadership Summit .
Cruz will be there too ."
2014-11-20,"Senator Ted Cruz led the conservative charge against Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to use executive action to reform the immigration system on Thursday , adapting remarks by the Roman philosopher Cicero to accuse the president of wanting to â€œdestroy the constitutionâ€ � .
In speech on the Senate floor , Cruz , a Texas Republican , appeared to mimic the Roman politician , whose defence of democracy he described as â€œpowerfully relevant 2,077 years laterâ€ � .
Obama is scheduled to unveil his plans to shield up to five million undocumented migrants from deportation in a move that has infuriated Republican opponents who argue he is overreaching his own powers to grant an effective â€œamnestyâ€ � .
â€œWhen , President Obama , do you mean to cease abusing our patience?â€ �
Cruz declared in a speech modelled on Ciceroâ€ ™ s First Oration Against Catiline to the Roman Senate .
â€œHow long is that madness of yours still to mock us ?
When is there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours swaggering about as it does now?â€ �
While Cruz was making the theatrical remarks , Republican leaders were struggling to establish precisely how they can use their control of Congress to undermine the presidentâ€ ™ s plans .
In a blow to Obamaâ€ ™ s conservative critics , the Republican chairman of the House appropriations committee , which Republicans had hoped could be used to defund any presidential action over immigration , said it was not technically possible .
Hal Rogers , from Kentucky , said the primary agency for implementing Obamaâ€ ™ s imminent executive order is â€œentirely self - funded through the fees it collects for any of its operationsâ€ � and is therefore not operationally funded by Congress .
â€œTherefore , the appropriations process can not be used to â€˜de - fundâ€ ™ the agency , â€ �
he said , adding that the US citizenship and immigration services would continue to operate in the event of a government shutdown .
His statement neutered one of the instruments Republicans were most hopeful of using to combat Obamaâ€ ™ s executive action , through which he is widely expected to grant work permits â€ “ and de facto permission to stay in the US â€ “ to millions of people who are in the country illegally .
Republican congressional sources said there was pressure from the top ranks of the party to delay any reaction to Obamaâ€ ™ s announcement until January , when the party retakes control of the Senate .
Cruz , who orchestrated the 2013 government shutdown in protest over Obamaâ€ ™ s healthcare law , has proposed another course of action , suggesting that incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell should block every Obama administration nomination sent to the Senate , except for those that relate to vital national security positions .
That too would rely on waiting until the next Congress .
McConnell also predicted a confrontation between the White House and Congress that will take place in January , when Republicans reap the benefits of their midterm election victories .
â€œIf President Obama acts in defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country , Congress will act , â€ � said McConnell .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re considering a variety of actions .
But make no mistake , when the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats , they will act.â€
�
Yet any such delay is unlikely to satisfy the partyâ€ ™ s right wing , particularly in the more conservative House , where Cruz has become a standard - bearer for Tea Party - aligned members .
Cruz delighted supporters at the height of the confrontation over Obamacare last year with a marathon Senate speech lasting 21 hours and 19 minutes , in which he quoted actor Ashton Kutcher and Dr
Seussâ€ ™ s
Green Eggs and Ham .
Thursdayâ€ ™ s speech , in which Cruz effectively twisted Ciceroâ€ ™ s remarks to turn it into a critique of presidential power , was far shorter â€ “ lasting just four minutes
â€ “ but no less bizarre .
He said the president was â€œopenly desirous to destroy the constitution in this Republicâ€ � and added : â€œWe alone , and I say it openly , are waiting in our duty to stop this lawless administration and its unconstitutional amnesty.â€ �
Rather than any complaint about executive power , Ciceroâ€ ™ s speech in 63 BC was actually a denunciation of a Catiline , a fellow Roman senator who had secretly plotted to violently overthrow the Republic .
Cambridge University professor Malcolm Schofield , one of the worldâ€ ™ s foremost experts on Cicero , said the Roman orator was , himself , accused of overreach .
â€œQuite a lot of people did think that in dealing with Catiline , Cicero overreached his powers , â€ �
he said .
â€œHe had some of [ Catilineâ€ ™ s ] associates , who were Roman citizens , summarily executed without trial .
It is a question whether he had the powers to do that.â€ �
That detail does not appear to have dissuaded Cruz .
Cruzâ€ ™
s remarks were the most high - profile among a cascade of complaints from Republicans , on the Senate floor and along the corridors of the Capitol , over a president they accused of forcing through an undemocratic policy that would deprive US citizens of jobs and act as a magnet for thousands of illegal migrants .
â€œShame on the age and its lost principles
, â€ � Cruz thundered .
â€œThis man dictates by his pen and his phone .
Dictates !
Ah , he wonâ€ ™ t even come into the Senate .
He will not take part in the public deliberations .
He ignores every individual among us .
And we gallant men and women think that we are doing our duty to the Republic if we keep out of the way of his frenzied attacks.â€ � Cruz added : â€œYou ought , President Obama , long ago have been led to defeat by your own disdain for the people.â€ �"
2014-11-21,"On Thursday , President Obama announced that he will use executive action â€ “ and push the limits of the law â€ “ to shield as many as 5 m undocumented immigrants from deportation .
The reaction from Republicans , even prior to his official announcement , was predictably measured : imminent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argued that Obama has waved a â€œred flag in front of a bullâ€ � ; Senator Ted Cruz invoked Cicero and called the president â€œan unaccountable monarch imposing his own policies in defiance of the American peopleâ€ � ; House Majority Leader John Boehner said Obama â€œsure acting like ... an emperorâ€ � .
Boehner actually invoked perhaps the emptiest threat in known human history on Thursday , asserting that if Obama acts , â€œThere will be no chance of immigration reform moving in this Congress.â€ �
I suspect that Obama can live with his actions and their success in reducing the likelihood that immigration reform will pass in the House from 0 % ... to 0 % .
It was inevitable that the Republican reaction would be overwrought ( â€œdictatorialâ€ � ! ) , inappropriate ( â€œsex traffickingâ€ � ! ) , pathetic ( â€œethnic cleansingâ€ � ! )
and/or downright stupid ( â€œanarchyâ€ � ! ) .
But do Obamaâ€ ™ s actions give the rest of us something to worry about ?
Hell , yes â€ “ Iâ€ ™ m not exactly looking forward to President Rand Paul unilaterally repealing the Civil Rights Act for the duration of his presidency .
Still , Obamaâ€ ™ s move on immigration may reflect some worrisome trends in the expansion of executive power â€ “ but that doesnâ€ ™ t mean heâ€ ™ s morally wrong to unilaterally act , nor constitutionally limited from doing so .
Is it the executive order legal ?
Probably , yes .
Separation - of - powers arguments do not involve mechanical precision , and itâ€ ™ s not impossible to argue that Obamaâ€ ™ s actions violate the Constitution .
But the arguments will be necessarily weak .
As Ben Wittes explained at the Lawfare blog , Congress gave the executive branch discretion over when to issue deportation orders and it didnâ€ ™ t require the attorney general to issue deportation orders for everyone who is theoretically eligible for deportation .
Obamaâ€ ™ s more systematic refusal to deport people eligible for deportation might violate the spirit of the law , but it doesnâ€ ™ t violate the letter .
Discretion in law enforcement is inherent to executive power , and in the case of immigration enforcement , Congress did not even try to eliminate it .
Claims that Obamaâ€ ™
s
refusal to deport people makes him a lawless tyrant are , to be charitable , overstated .
Does that make his executive order beyond reproach ?
Not necessarily : the letter of the law matters , but norms also matter , and there are plenty of procedural manoeuvres that can subvert basic democratic principles while being perfectly legal .
The frightening plan offered by some Republicans to rig the Electoral College is at war with basic principles of democracy , but itâ€ ™ s probably perfectly legal .
The Senate could , hypothetically , impose a de facto supermajority requirement on legislation , refuse to confirm any judicial or executive branch nominees , and vote to add 20 new seats to the US supreme court without exceeding its formal constitutional powers â€ “ but that wouldnâ€ ™ t be good for our government .
That wouldnâ€ ™ t be good for anybody .
American democracy canâ€ ™ t really work when everyone acts to the maximum extent of their legal power all the time â€ “ even if lawyers would all be making some solid overtime pay ,
thereâ€ ™ s
balance within checks and balances .
Obamaâ€ ™ s executive order is not as dangerous as trying to rig the Electoral College or summarily rejecting all supreme court nominees , but itâ€ ™ s far from an ideal way to address immigration reform .
If the Republican party was at all interested in actual governance , a mediocre immigration reform proposal passed by Congress would be preferable to an executive order , which can be undone with the stroke of a pen after the next election ( which will not have Barack Obama on the ballot ) .
But that also undermines claims
that Obamaâ€ ™ s executive order represents â€œtyrannyâ€ � .
Does using executive privilege to achieve immigration reform set a dangerous precedent ?
Well , long before Obama even ran for elected office â€ “ as Erwin Chemerinsky and Samuel Kleiner observed at the New Republic â€ “
Ronald Reagan â€œtook executive action to limit deportations for 200,000 Nicaraguan exilesâ€ � and the first President Bush did the same for some Chinese and Kuwaiti citizens .
At most , Obamaâ€ ™ s actions differ only in degree , not kind .
In a more general sense , presidents have been pushing the limits of their constitutional authority since the beginning of the republic .
If you had asked Thomas Jefferson in 1799 if the Louisiana Purchase was constitutional , he would almost certainly have said no â€ “
but we arenâ€ ™ t giving the land back .
( Admittedly , sometimes Iâ€ ™ m tempted to say that the US should look for the receipt and return some of those now - red states to France in exchange for a few dozen cases of ChÃ¢teauneuf - du - Pape . )
Itâ€ ™ s understandable for liberals to worry that just because Obama used his executive authority in this way , some future Republican president â€ “ like Rand Paul the Terrible , or Emperor Marco Rubio , or His Highness Ted Cruz â€ “ might push the limits of the law over the edge .
But itâ€ ™ s pretty unhelpful , too .
Both the second Bush administration and the actions of Republicans in Congress make it abundantly clear that the next Republican in the Oval Office is going to push toward â€ “ and probably beyond â€ “ the limits of his legal authority , no matter what Obama does .
( For instance , George W Bushâ€ ™ s warrantless wiretapping program , established by executive order , contradicted a statute outright , which Obamaâ€ ™ s order does not . )
If hypothetical president Rand Paul wants to refuse to enforce the Civil Rights Act , heâ€ ™ s not going to be dissuaded because Obama refused to act on immigration .
Obamaâ€ ™ s actions are legal , theyâ€ ™ re salutary on policy grounds , they have ample historical precedent , and they certainly donâ€ ™ t contravene actual existing norms of American politics .
Theyâ€ ™ re not the ideal way of addressing the immigration issue but , at this point , theyâ€ ™ re the best that can be done .
Republicans chose the game , and â€œKingâ€ � Obama isnâ€ ™ t doing anything wrong by throwing in his ante ."
2015-01-12,"Senator Ted Cruz will chair the committee that oversees science and Nasa in the new Republican - controlled Congress , raising fears that the conservative Texan will cut funding to the space agency and science programs .
Cruzâ€ ™ s appointment to the space , science and competitiveness subcommittee comes amid a broad shift of power in the Senate , where the GOP won a majority in the 2014 midterm elections .
Cruz was the top Republican on the subcommittee before the elections .
He has publicly stated support for Nasa but has also attempted at least once to cut the agencyâ€ ™ s funding , arguing that larger government cuts necessitated changes to the space programâ€ ™ s budget .
In 2013 , Cruz both tried to reduce Nasaâ€ ™ s budget and said :
â€œItâ€ ™ s critical that the United States ensure its continued leadership in space.â€ �
Cruz has constituents invested in the space agencyâ€ ™ s future â€ “ for instance , Nasa employees and contractors at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
Cruz has also spoken out against decades of science that indicate climate change , telling CNN last year that in â€œthe last 15 years , there has been no recorded warmingâ€ � to support â€œa so - called scientific theoryâ€ � .
His vociferous opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and his support of extreme budget cuts could spell trouble for Nasaâ€ ™ s less prominent programs , such as its own climate research and sophisticated supercomputers .
His role on the front lines of the 2013 government shutdown , which critics say had lasting negative effects on public safety , Nasa research and EPA scientistsâ€ ™ ability to visit contaminated sites , also suggests at best a narrow focus on Nasaâ€ ™ s largest projects and at worst a disregard for agencies that require science funding .
Senator Marco Rubio , Republican from Florida , was named chair to the subcommittee on oceans , atmosphere , fisheries and coast guard , which oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Nooa ) and the protection of oceans and marine life in US jurisdiction .
Rubio has said he does not â€œbelieve that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climateâ€ � , which is a more lenient position than the new chair of the environment committee , Jim Inhofe , who denies climate science outright .
In December , Congress gave Nasa a boost to its 2015 budget , setting aside hundreds of millions of dollars for its planetary science program and new Space Launch System rocket , which aims to revolutionize advanced rocketry .
Due to budget cuts and programs that the government has allowed to lapse , Nasa has increasingly relied on private space companies in recent years , including Elon Muskâ€ ™ s
SpaceX.
On Saturday SpaceX tested its own experimental rocket system , delivering supplies to the International Space Station before failing to land its reusable rocket on a floating platform ."
2015-01-25,"Heavyweight Republicans lined up in Iowa on Saturday claiming to be the leader who could retake the White House for conservatives , as the long race to become the partyâ€ ™ s nominee for US president in 2016 began in earnest .
Appearing at an all - day political beauty contest in front of voters whose caucuses will be the electionâ€ ™ s first nominating process next January , big - name Republicans from statehouses and congress explained why they had the vision and public appeal required for nationwide victory .
Ted Cruz , the precocious first - term senator from Texas , received the afternoonâ€ ™ s most enthusiastic reception from the 1,200-strong crowd in Des Moines , out of a schedule packed with party stars such as Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey , and former governors Rick Perry of Texas and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas .
Cruz won loud cheers as he challenged would - be rivals to â€œshow me where you stood up and foughtâ€ � for conservative priorities such as opposing abortion and same - sex marriage , endorsing religious rights and battling President Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s healthcare reforms .
â€œWe need to bring together a coalition of Americans who want to believe again in the miracle of America , â€ � said Cruz , in a sermon - style address that attacked the Internal Revenue Service and condemned the employees of the Environmental Protection Agency as â€œlocustsâ€ � .
Only Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin , hailed for pushing through anti - union legislation and slashing public spending in his Democratic - leaning state , appeared to match Cruz for enthusiasm among voters .
In a morning headline speech , Walker claimed his reforms â€œcan work anywhere in the countryâ€ � and urged Republicans â€œto go big and go boldâ€ � .
The speakers were gathered for the Freedom Summit , a nine - hour event convened by Steve King , a rightwing Iowa congressman and radio host .
The summit was backed by Citizens United , the conservative activist group that won a liberalisation of campaign finance limits at the US supreme court in 2010 .
Perry and Huckabee offered the clearest indications of any speakers that they would soon jump into a contest poised to be more crowded than any in recent memory .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been thinking a little of 2016,â€ � said Perry .
On why he recently left his show on Fox News , Huckabee said : â€œIâ€ ™ ll leave it to your imagination , but it wasnâ€ ™ t just so I could go deer hunting
every Saturdayâ€ � .
But their comments were only the most blatant overtures among a series of thinly - veiled pitches for the partyâ€ ™ s nomination to take on a Democrat for the job of commander - in - chief in November .
Hillary Clinton , the former secretary of state , is considered the likely Democratic frontrunner .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing wrong in America today that canâ€ ™ t be fixed with new leadership , â€ � said Perry .
â€œThe next two years are about hope and revival , and a vision to restore Americaâ€ ™ s place in the world.â€ �
To whoops and applause , Perry added : â€œAmerica is looking for a new path forward and starting today , right here in Iowa , lets give it to â€˜emâ€ � .
Christie , viewed by many as the most moderate would - be candidate in attendance , reeled off impressive statistics from his re - election victory in New Jersey last year as he received a predictably lukewarm response from the conservative - leaning audience .
â€œThe next century does not have to be a Chinese century , â€ � said Christie .
â€œIt can be an American centuryâ€ � .
Making the case for himself as a conservative in another Democrat - heavy state , Christie told the crowd : â€œIf our conservatism is really going to succeed , it is going to have to defend itself in every part of our countryâ€ � .
The response was silence .
Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush , former governors of Massachusetts and Florida , were the only major candidates viewed as likely to compete for the nomination who did not appear at Saturdayâ€ ™ s rally .
Romney was dismissed by Donald Trump , the television personality and real estate magnate , as a â€œchokerâ€ � who had had his turn while Bushâ€ ™ s support for the controversial Common Core educational standards was attacked by others .
All speakers were keen to attack Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy as a stance of weakness that had diminished Americaâ€ ™ s role in international affairs .
Criticising Obama for identifying climate change rather than Islamic State terrorists as the countryâ€ ™ s most serious threat in his State of the Union address last week , Huckabee said : â€œMr President , I would think that a beheading is a far greater threat to an American than a sunburnâ€ � .
Cruz sought to tie Obamaâ€ ™ s record overseas to the likely Democratic nominee , who was seldom mentioned in the dayâ€ ™ s speeches .
â€œWe have seen the fruits of the Obama - Clinton foreign policy of receding from the world , â€ � said the Texas senator .
â€œLeading from behind doesnâ€ ™ t work.â€ �
Amid a steadily improving economy that has seen the highest pace of job creation in years , Republican attacks on Obamaâ€ ™ s handling of the countryâ€ ™ s finances were rarer than during the 2012 election campaign , when the Republican nominee , Mitt Romney , styled himself as the candidate to turn around Americaâ€ ™ s economic fate .
However several continued to lament the countryâ€ ™ s $ 18 trillion national debt , with Perry arguing that the US needed â€œmajor economic and fiscal reformsâ€ � .
Boasting of the large proportion of new jobs that Texas had contributed to the national total under his governorship , he said : â€œI happen to know something about this.â€ �"
2015-02-26,"Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz served up a big helping of red meat for his Tea Party base in Washington on Thursday , with a pugilistic speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) .
Taking aim at the political establishment on both the left and right , the Texas senator told the crowd the biggest divide in the US was â€œnot between Republicans and Democrats ; it is between the career politicians in Washington and the American people.â€ �
In a speech that was almost a point - for - point rehash of his address at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January , Cruz set out his stall for the far right of the base , hitting all the touchstones along the way .
As in Iowa , Cruz quoted Ronald Reagan , saying : â€œThe path to victory â€ ¦ lies in painting with bold colours , not with pale pastels.â€ �
Pastel colours are certainly nowhere to be found in Cruzâ€ ™ s rhetorical palette .
â€œObamacare is a trainwreck â€ “ and thatâ€ ™
s actually not fair to trainwrecks
, â€ � he boomed , promising to repeal â€œevery blasted wordâ€ � of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s signature healthcare reforms .
Cruz was interviewed by Sean Hannity of Fox News , with whom he joked convivially .
â€œIâ€ ™ m asking you this next question because I know the liberal media will , â€ � said Hannity .
To general mirth , Cruz responded : â€œNo , I have not stopped beating my wife.â€ � Low - balled a question on the subject by Hannity , without a flicker of irony Cruz slammed â€œbirthersâ€ � who claim that since he was born in another country â€ “
Canada â€
“ he would be ineligible to run for president .
â€œUnder law I am a natural - born citizen , â€ � he said .
Asked what the first five actions on the agenda of a Ted Cruz presidency would be , he said : repeal Obamacare ; abolish the Internal Revenue Service ( â€œTake all 125,000 IRS agents and put them on the southern borderâ€ � ) ; stop â€œout of control regulationsâ€ � by the Environmental Protection Agency .
By item
No 4 , he seemed to be running out of steam .
â€œConstitutional rights!â€ � he shouted , after a brief pause .
â€œAll of them!â€
�
He ended with a slightly hammy , almost tearful setpiece on American exceptionalism .
â€œThis country is the greatest country in the history of the world , â€ � he intoned , his voice cracking for maximum emotional effect ."
2015-02-27,"Intra - party Republican fighting over how to confront the White House on immigration reform spilled outside the bounds of Congress on Thursdaywhen prospective Republican presidential candidates accused their colleagues on Capitol Hill of surrendering on the issue .
Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas both used appearances at the Conservative Political Action Committee in National Harbor , Maryland , to decry what they called an imminent capitulation .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got Republicans in Washington about to wave the white flag of surrender on amnesty , â€ � said Jindal .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re about to wave the white flag of surrender on Obamacare .
And weâ€ ™ re here to tell them : â€˜We wonâ€
™ t stand for thatâ€ ™
.â€ �
He said â€œthis election wasnâ€ ™ t about getting a nicer office for Senator Mitch McConnell , â€ � referring to the Republican sweep of the November midterms , adding : â€œThis election wasnâ€ ™ t about getting a bigger office for Speaker John Boehner .
This election was about taking our country back.â€ �
The battle over immigration reform shaped up after Democrats in the Senate stopped the body from taking up a House bill that blocked President Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions on immigration as part of legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security .
Democratic leaders accused Republicans of holding homeland security funding hostage .
Republicans said Democrats were using procedural maneuvers to avoid a vote on the issue .
The Senate seemed to be moving to act on Thursday evening on a new bill that would fund homeland security without touching , for the moment , the presidentâ€ ™ s immigration actions .
Boehner said on Wednesday that he would wait for the Senate to act before discussing the next move in the House .
Without action in both bodies of Congress , funding for the Department of Homeland Security was set to expire at midnight Friday .
Jindal spoke in an afternoon session that followed a crowd - pleasing midday speech by Cruz , one of the runaway stars of the gathering of hard - right conservatives .
Cruz said the Republican congressional leadership was â€œcutting a dealâ€ � with the White House on â€œexecutive amnesty.â€ � â€œIn Washington , K Street and Wall Street love amnesty , they support the substantive policy , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThere is a mendacity about Washington â€ “ they want to take a show vote , but they donâ€ ™ t actually want to follow through on what they say.â€ �"
2015-03-07,"Senator Ted Cruz has alleged that the leak of the pending indictment of the New Jersey Democratic senator Bob Menendez may be a politically motivated act of retaliation by Barack Obama and the Department of Justice .
Speaking to reporters at the Iowa Agricultural Summit in Des Moines on Saturday , the Texas Republican said he found it â€œawfully
coincidentalâ€ � that charges were reportedly set to be brought against Menendez , a leading Democratic critic of Obamaâ€ ™ s Middle East policy , during such a fraught period in US negotiations with Iran .
The two - term New Jersey senator has long been under investigation regarding his ties to Salomon Melgen , a wealthy donor .
The two have vacationed together in the Dominican Republic and Menendez has advocated for policy changes to Medicare which would financially benefit Melgen , an ophthalmologist .
To Cruz , it was â€œa troubling coincidenceâ€ � that a two - year investigation into Menendez was culminating in the same week the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , addressed a joint session of Congress to condemn the negotiations .
Cruz went on to say that this â€œraises suggestions to other Democrats if you dare part from [ the ] Obama White House that criminal prosecutions will be used potentially as a weapon against you as wellâ€ � .
Menendez , the ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee , has repeatedly pushed for tougher sanctions against Iran .
In January , he said the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s talking points on negotiations were â€œstraight out of Tehranâ€ � .
No indictment has yet been formally filed against Menendez and in a press conference on Friday night , he vehemently denied the allegations .
â€œI have always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law , â€ � he told reporters ."
2015-03-18,"Curtailing the Earth sciences mission of Nasa would deprive scientists of important data relating to volcanic eruptions , destructive algae growth , extreme weather events and much more , experts warned a week after a confrontation on Capitol Hill over the Nasa budget between Senator Ted Cruz and the agency director .
At a routine budget hearing , Cruz challenged Nasaâ€ ™ s administrator , Charles Bolden , a former astronaut , to explain why funding for the agencyâ€ ™ s Earth sciences mission had grown while funding for space exploration had shrunk .
â€œI would suggest that almost any American would agree that the core function of Nasa is to explore space , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œI am concerned that Nasa in the current environment has lost its full focus on that core mission.â€
�
Bolden replied that a shift in emphasis away from manned space shuttle flights had produced savings in the area of exploration , but that in any case the observation and study of Earth was a central part of Nasaâ€ ™ s core mission .
â€œIt is absolutely critical that we understand Earthâ€ ™ s environment , because this is the only place we have to live , â€ � Bolden said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got to take care of it .
and the only way to take care of it is to know whatâ€ ™ s happening.â€
�
The exchange raised eyebrows in part because Cruz is a climate change skeptic , and his attack on Nasaâ€ ™ s efforts to study the Earth , which it carries out primarily through satellite technology , was perceived as an attack on the ability to document climate change .
Cruzâ€ ™ s office did not reply to a request for comment .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s position could be seen as merely an extension of previous Republican attempts to reduce Nasaâ€ ™ s Earth sciences mission , which some have proposed should be shifted to another agency such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , said Marcia S Smith , founder and editor of SpacePolicyOnline.com .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not new , itâ€ ™ s not something that Senator Cruz came up with , â€ � Smith said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s arguing what has been a Republican line for some time , which is that this should not be Nasaâ€ ™ s responsibility , because Nasaâ€ ™ s unique role is space exploration , so that should be its priority.â€ � Top Earth and space scientists warned , however , that the particular exploration of earth that Nasa carries out with satellites could not readily be replicated by a different agency .
â€œNasa is an agency that has incredible expertise in satellites and in getting satellites into space , â€ � said Margaret Leinen , vice - chancellor for marine sciences and director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California - San Diego .
â€œAnd while Noaa does some of that , Nasa is the agency that , thatâ€ ™ s their bread - and - butter .
They are the experts.â€ �
Leinen said Nasa satellites could observe deformations of the Earth on a day - to - day , week - to - week basis that could identify a seismic or volcanic event .
â€œYou can see how a volcano is bulging , and how dangerous it is , â€ �
she said .
â€œWhether
itâ€ ™ s moving or whether itâ€ ™
s quiet .
You can look at the major faults in Los Angeles and other places , and see the accumulation of stress .
â€œOne of Nasaâ€ ™ s satellites that looks at the oceans , called Aqua , has many different measuring instruments on it , â€ � Leinen continued .
â€œOne of them , for example , allows us to look at the concentration of phytoplankton in the ocean , and what kind of phytoplankton are there .
And one of the things that thatâ€ ™ s used for is monitoring harmful algal blooms in coastal areas .
â€œItâ€ ™ s another great example of a basic research satellite thatâ€ ™ s also doing work thatâ€ ™ s essential to protecting us from harm.â€ �
A Nasa satellite project allowed teams responding to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to track the movement of the oil into coastal waterways and monitor other impacts , according to a letter sent to Cruz by the American Geophysical Union , which represents 60,000 earth and space scientists .
The White House agreed in its latest budget request that Nasaâ€ ™ s earth sciences program was critical , calling for a 10 % jump to $ 1.9bn for the program for fiscal year 2016 , out of $ 18.5bn total for the agency .
As chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees Nasa , Cruz can hold oversight hearings and originate legislation shaping Nasa , Smith has pointed out , but Cruz does not hold the agencyâ€ ™ s purse strings , which belong to appropriations .
In any case , Cruz , for his general budget hawkishness , has not called for cuts to Nasaâ€ ™ s space exploration mission .
Legislators from Texas tend to like space exploration , for one very good reason named the Lyndon B Johnson space center , which sprawls over 1,600 acres just outside Houston ( as in , â€œHouston , weâ€ ™ ve had a problemâ€ � ) .
Space exploration is â€œwhat inspires little boys and little girls across this countryâ€ � , Cruz said at last weekâ€ ™ s hearing .
â€œItâ€ ™ s what sets Nasa apart from any other agency , is the mission that has landed man on the moon , that has the potential to explore new worlds beyond our imagination.â€ � Bolden , the Nasa administrator , replied that space exploration would not be possible if rising sea levels sank launchpads in coastal areas such as Cape Canaveral , Florida .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t go anywhere if the Kennedy space center goes underwater , and we donâ€ ™
t know it , â€ � Bolden said .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s understanding our environment.â€
� Leinen said it was important for Congress to promote understanding of how and why Nasa looks at the Earth .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s concerning is that if people donâ€ ™ t understand the value of the Earth sciences mission , it can lead to cuts down the line , â€ �
she said .
â€œIt can lead to â€ “ in the same way that a misunderstanding in any part of life can lead to consequences â€ “ whatâ€ ™ s concerning is that this could lead to a misunderstanding within Congress about the importance of that valuable mission.â€ �"
2015-03-22,"Texas Senator Ted Cruz , a firebrand Republican , will become the first declared candidate in the 2016 presidential race on Monday morning when he announces his candidacy with a speech at Liberty University in Virginia .
Cruz , who has been in the Senate just two years , announced his plan to throw his Stetson in the ring with a short campaign video posted online overnight .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again , â€ � Cruz says in the video .
â€œAnd Iâ€ ™ m ready to stand with you to lead the fight.â€ �
Cruz is one of as many as 20 Republicans expected to declare a campaign for the 2016 White House .
The first primary voting starts in about 10 months with the Iowa Republican caucuses next January .
One of the most dynamic figures to emerge on the national political landscape since Barack Obama , Cruz quickly rose to fame as a freshman senator by pursuing a plan to block the presidentâ€ ™ s healthcare policy that resulted in a 16-day partial closure of the federal government in October 2013 .
Many Republican colleagues resented the move , which did not work and which they saw as politically costly .
But the conservative base loved it , and sharply anti - Obama , small - government partisans remain the core of Cruzâ€ ™ s support .
Cruz came in third in straw - poll voting at the Conservative Political Action Committeeâ€ ™ s annual conference in Washington earlier this year , trailing Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker .
â€œHe is a viable candidate , â€ �
one former critic of Cruz , Arizona senator John McCain , said on Sunday .
Back in early 2013 , shortly after Cruzâ€ ™ s arrival in the Senate , McCain had deemed him and colleagues with similarly flamboyant conservative plumage
â€œwacko birdsâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s a time for truth .
a time to rise to the challenge , just as Americans have always done , â€ �
Cruz says in his first campaign video .
As former solicitor general of Texas , Cruz , 44 , argued nine cases before the US Supreme Court , winning five of them .
He is a graduate of Princeton University and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard law school .
He was born three days before Christmas 1970 in Calgary , Alberta , but has said he has revoked his Canadian dual citizenship .
His father is a Cuban immigrant .
Cruzâ€ ™ s stub campaign site highlights his views on foreign policy , family values , the economy and the Constitution â€ “ that last heading an umbrella for some of the issues the senator has gotten his most political mileage from , including opposition to gun control and support for keeping the words â€œunder Godâ€

He would be the first Hispanic president in US history ."

2015-03-23,"Weâ€ ™ re going to wrap up our live blog for the morning .
Hereâ€ ™ s a summary of where things stand :
Ted Cruz , the Republican senator from Texas , is running for president , he announced .
Cruz outlined a hard - right conservative platform calling for an appeal of the presidentâ€ ™ s health care law , abolishment of the IRS , a flat tax , restrictions on abortion , support for Israel , a redoubled war on â€œradical Islamic terrorismâ€ � and more ( video here ) .
Cruzâ€ ™
s announcement was met with enthusiastic cheers from the auditorium crowd at Liberty University in Virginia , where attendance for students was mandatory .
The notable rhetorical trope of Cruzâ€ ™ s speech was a repetition of the word â€œimagine , â€ � as in , â€œimagine
a president who says I will honor the Constitution and under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.â€
�
Hillary Clinton spoke at a simultaneous , if not exactly parallel , event at the Center for American Progress about investment in urban infrastructure and employment programs .
She did not make any announcements .
Remember that crazy viral
Too Many Cooks video Judging by online reactions to Senator Cruzâ€
™ s announcement that he is running for president , it was preachy , idealistic , and off - the - cuff .
The Internet judged the Cruz announcement to be : Preachy ( USA Today ) :
His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church .
He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage .
He emotionally described how his fatherâ€ ™ s embrace of Jesus saved his parentsâ€ ™ marriage .
His father , Rafael , a pastor at a suburban Dallas church , fled Castroâ€ ™ s Cuba in 1957 .
Teleprompter - less ( The Hill ) :
Cruz made 2016 announcement speech without a teleprompter Sen. Ted Cruz ( R - Texas ) made his speech announcing that he would run for the presidency without the assistance of a teleprompter , his spokesman said Monday .
Imaginary :
Underfunded ( Bloomberg ) :
But a review of Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign finances shows surprising weakness when it comes to small donors .
Contributors giving Cruz less than $ 200 per election cycle made up just 16 percent of his funding base through the end of 2014 , compared to Kentucky Senator Rand Paulâ€ ™ s 43 percent , according to the Center for Responsive Politics Awesome ( Draft Ted Cruz PAC ) : This is an interesting factoid , playing on the fact that the last time a first - term senator with a law degree ran for president against Hillary Clinton he was inaugurated : The Clinton event is ending .
â€œAmen , â€ �
she says , in conclusion , in a transparent play to the sympathies of people of faith in the audience .
â€œI love sessions like this .
Itâ€ ™ s really nice to get back into an evidence - based discussion.â€ � Dan Roberts points out that for the sparsity of her speech at this roundtable , Clinton has managed to bring up the family foundation â€ “ donations to which from repressive foreign governments have been in the news â€ “ twice : ICYMI :
CSPAN has cut video of the Cruz announcement , representative reactions to which we are even now assembling for your review .
Clinton : â€œWe have at the last count I say 5.6 m people in America between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither at school nor at work.â€ �
â€œPart of the challenge is working with companies that will do exactly what youâ€ ™ re saying , making it possible to have these entry points ...
one thing that Germany does is instead of having an unemployment system , they have a wage subsidy system ...

Back at the Clinton event at the Center for American Progress , a guy in glasses with a glass of water in front of him says â€œWhat weâ€ ™ re learning on the ground is that thereâ€ ™ s no silver bullet to these urban challenges.â€ � â€œWe will restore that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America .
Thank you and God bless you.â€ �
Cruz is done .
Big cheers at Liberty University .
â€œAlmost a megachurch sermon
, â€ � somebody on CNN says .
Theyâ€ ™ re right , from the pacing evangelist all the way down to the electric bass .
There are some supporters of presidential hopeful Rand Paul â€ “ Stand with Rand types â€ “ in the audience today , as in any campus crowd .
And apparently there are some castration threats out against them .
â€œToday I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States , â€ � Cruz says .
First .
The touchstone word of Cruzâ€ ™ s speech is â€œimagine ,
â€ � whether he is inviting the crowd to imagine the abolition of Common Core education standards or the abolition of the IRS or â€œimagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israelâ€ � or â€œimagine a president who says I will honor the Constitution and under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.â€
�
Thatâ€ ™ s in the Constitution ?
Whatever .
Let us be the first of a million people to make this joke : Heâ€ ™ s still going .
â€œImagine itâ€ ™ s 1775 , and you
and I were sitting there in Richmond listening to Patrick Henry say ,
â€˜Give me Liberty or Give me Death.â€
™ â€ �
Cruz has been speaking for about 15 minutes now and
he still hasnâ€ ™ t declared his candidacy for president .
Heâ€ ™ s throwing progressively larger rhetorical punches , though .
And now a hint at why Cruz picked 23 March for his presidential announcement : â€œFive years ago today , the president signed Obamacare into law , â€ � he says , to resounding boos in the hall .
â€œImagine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare ,
â€ �
Cruz says .
The question is , would any presidential candidate dare to campaign on such a platform .
Hereâ€ ™ s good news : Weâ€ ™ ll be talking about flat taxes in 2016 !
â€œImagine a flat tax ,
that lets every American fill out his taxes on a post card ,
â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œImagine abolishing the IRS.â€ � Pop Quiz : which phrases did Ted Cruz just use in a passage of his speech
( he seems to be working without notes ) about â€œreigniting the promise of Americaâ€ � ?
( Hint , itâ€ ™ s e ) a ) American exceptionalism b ) clarion voice c )
City on a Hill d ) unique nation in the history of the world e ) all of the above Clinton has partners on her panel and has passed along the microphone for a moment .
Weâ€
™ re jumping fully into the Cruz canoe .
Cruz has been narrating the dramatic history of his family background and of his childhood and student years .
Cruz is telling his life story in the heroic third person .
â€œWhere he was alone and scared ...
At the age of 17 , he went to get two jobs to help pay his way through school ...
â€ �
OK , weâ€ ™ re going to go a cappella .
Who said it ?
Theyâ€ ™ re both drinking far too much .
Theyâ€ ™ re living a fast life .
When I was three , my father decided to leave my mother and I. Itâ€ ™ s not about race .
White and black citizens of a city like Atlanta both have low upward mobility .
Invited him to a Bible study ... and there my father gave his life to Jesus Christ .
We need to think hard about what weâ€ ™ re going to do , now that people are moving back to and living in cities .
[ Applause ] there are people who wonder if faith is real .
Weâ€ ™ ve got them now , speaking in parallel mere miles apart , your 2016 presidential candidates ( Hillary Clinton has not declared a presidential candidacy ) :
Clinton :
How do we make sure our cities are good places to live and work ?
Cruz : God Bless Liberty University .
I am thrilled to join you today at the largest Christian University in the world .
Today I want to talk with you about the promise of America .
Clinton : What we can do in partnership with the public and private sector .
Let me just make three quick points .
I think
that we for a long time at the federal level but also the state level ....
Cruz : She had a difficult father .
A man who drank far too much and frankly didnâ€ ™ t think that women should be educated .
Clinton :
But that raises the second point .
How do we repair and update our water infrastructure .
To say nothing of keeping up with an electric grid ...
Cruz :
[ Applause ]
Imagine a teenage boy .
Clinton :
Potholes exploding , all kinds of issues .
We have to really invest .
Is the contrast between the soft - rock uplift in the air at the Ted Cruz event and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s imminent appearance
â€ “
sheâ€

We report , you decide .
Hereâ€ ™ s a video stream of the Clinton event : Weâ€ ™ ve posted a video stream of the Cruz event atop the blog .
Enjoy .
The band , if you havenâ€ ™ t been listening , is kind of late - STP with an extremely diluted sprinkle of Monuments .
At the Cruz event so far : rock , faith : Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts ( @robertsdan ) is with Clinton this morning , while the Guardianâ€ ™ s Alan Yuhas is at the Cruz event :
Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the biggest day in American politics since the third season of House of Cards sucked .
Whatever else happens this Monday â€ “ barring some truly unforeseen twist â€ “ historians will remember 23 March , 2015 , as the official start of the 2016 presidential campaign .
Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas is scheduled to declare his presidential candidacy in a speech at Liberty University , the Christian institution in Lynchburg , Virginia , at 10 am ET .
Cruzâ€ ™ s was expected to the be first of what may be as many as 20 ( twenty ) eventual announcements on the Republican side of a willingness to lead the country out of the nightmare of the Barack Obama years .
Another major national politician , Hillary Clinton , also was expected to speak today , twice actually .
Following a morning speech on income inequality at the Center for American Progress , Clinton was to deliver the keynote address at a ceremony sponsored by Syracuse University to recognize the countryâ€ ™ s top political reporter , as identified by the judges for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting .
The recipient will be honored with $ 5,000 and a ceremonial blocking by Clinton of that reporterâ€ ™ s phone number .
Join us for a day of politics fun !"
2015-03-23,"Ted Cruz became the first official US presidential candidate on Monday , not by way of his home state of Texas but in a direct appeal to the Christian right .
Onstage with his trademark hands - free headset at Liberty University â€ “ founded by the late evangelist leader Jerry Falwell and touted as the largest Christian college in the world â€ “ Cruz made a pitch to voters that was equal parts megachurch sermon and unabashed conservative checklist .
In a Republican field that is about to become much more crowded , the freshman senator formally launched his campaign for the White House â€ “ and demonstrated the continued influence of religious conservatives on his party .
If that Bible - thumping base remains an obstacle between Republicans and the White House , the question now is : can Cruz stave off his rivals to get enough thump for his buck to topple the establishment â€ “ and still win over millennials ?
â€œToday , roughly half of born - again Christians arenâ€ ™ t voting .
Theyâ€ ™ re staying home , â€ �
Cruz declared in his speech .
â€œImagine instead millions of people of faith going out to the polls and voting our values.â€
�
Courting the support of the Christian right has long been a staple of the Republican primary season , even as the demographicâ€ ™ s prominence has waned in recent presidential contests as the US becomes more socially liberal .
The majority of red - state Republicans identify as evangelical Christians , and it was white evangelicals who predominantly helped propel the GOP to its landslide victory in the 2014 midterm elections .
In 2016 , religious activists and political operatives insist , the support of Christian voters will be critical in the early - voting states of Iowa and South Carolina , where evangelical leaders believe they can best winnow a deep Republican field to take on Hillary Clinton , the presumptive Democratic frontrunner .
â€œIn the past several election cycles , I donâ€
™ t think religious liberty has even been asked about in the primary or general election debates ,
â€ �
Russell Moore , president of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission , told the Guardian .
â€œBut this year , it is a major focus for evangelicals as well as for Roman Catholics.â€ � Cruz , a Tea Party favorite who was elected to the Senate in 2012 , once again invoked what he called the Obama administrationâ€
™ s
â€œassault on our religious libertyâ€ �
â€ “ name - checking everything from the supreme courtâ€ ™ s Hobby Lobby contraception case to church groups helping the poor , and from abortion to â€œthe sacrament of marriageâ€ � .
Moore , who has met with Cruz and other Republican candidates expected to declare in the coming weeks , said it would be essential for anyone who seeks evangelical support to be a staunch proponent of â€œthe sanctity of human life and family stabilityâ€ � .
Using abortion and gay marriage against Bush and Co Establishment - backed candidates - in - waiting like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have sought to avoid discussing reproductive rights and same - sex marriage , as the party struggles to make inroads with both young and female voters .
Even though the 2012 election marked a record 78%-21 % split among white evangelicals in favor of Republican candidate Mitt Romney , Obama trounced his opponent among key demographics such as youths , minorities and single women .
Since then , evangelicals have set out to ensure their values are not shut out by Republican party leaders taking steps to avoid a drawn - out primary in which the prospective nominee is , like Mitt Romney , forced too far to the right .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , 2012 presidential candidate Rick Santorum and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson are among the other Republican insurgents vying for the same demographic .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Florida senator Marco Rubio , arguably Cruzâ€ ™ s chief rivals , have also held meetings with faith leaders .
A GOP operative told the Guardian that this election cycle , evangelical voters are â€œputting a premium on experience and the ability to govern over slick packingâ€ � .
â€œWe have seen what has happened when the country elected somebody who was a one - term senator who gives a good speech with zero accomplishments , â€ � said the operative , who requested anonymity to speak freely about the gathering Republican field .
â€œThis time , Republican primary evangelicals and general election evangelicals want a candidate who not just talks a good game , but who has actual accomplishments in the areas that they care most about.â€
� Courting â€˜the lifeline of the Republican Partyâ€ ™
In his two - plus years in the Senate , Cruz has made a name for himself as a rabble - rouser who often butts heads with party leadership .
He has waged several ideological battles , most notorious among them his crusade against the presidentâ€ ™ s healthcare law that led to a 16-day government shutdown in 2013 , as well as sharp rebukes of Obamaâ€ ™ s immigration policies .
But even as Cruzâ€ ™ s tactics â€ “ which show little deference for Senate rules
â€ “ are often criticized by his Republican colleagues , the same theatrics have made him a star among grassroots social conservatives .
His success hinges on bringing together the three conservative factions of the Republican Party that donâ€ ™ t always walk in lockstep : evangelicals , Tea Party conservatives and libertarians .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got to have someone with broad enough appeal to reach within those three groups and pull enough supporters to beat the GOP establishment , â€ �
Steve Deace , a nationally syndicated radio host based in Iowa , told the Guardian .
Evangelicals , he added , remain the largest segment of the Republican base .
â€œIt is still the lifeline for the Republican Party even though they literally seem hell - bent at trying to betray them at every turn , â€ � Deace said .
â€œIf the GOP nominee
doesnâ€ ™ t energize the evangelical base and middle - class voters
â€
¦
I donâ€
™ t care how much money they have , I donâ€ ™ t care if the Democrats nominate a billy goat , they canâ€ ™ t win.â€
�
And while evangelicals have long been cast as so - called values voters , some believe they have a much broader role to play in 2016 than simply fighting the culture wars out loud .
Such voting blocs have been particularly spurred by the rise of terrorism and targeting of Christians and other religious minorities by militant groups overseas .
Indeed , Cruzâ€ ™ s biggest applause lines on Monday did not arrive when he spoke of how religion defined his upbringing or how â€œthe transformative love of Jesus Christâ€ � led his father to return home .
The crowd roared loudest when Cruz professed his support for Israel and spoke out against an emerging nuclear deal with Iran .
â€œImagine a president who will defeat radical Islam , and we will call it by its name ,
â€ � he said .
Although Obama is not on the ballot in 2016 , Republicans see an opening to extend the same attacks to his former secretary of state .
Given Clintonâ€ ™ s
advantage among white voters , a surge in evangelical turnout is a key factor , even this early , that could boost the eventual Republican nominee â€ “ and the reason why the Christian right can never be counted out ."
2015-03-23,"Texas senator Ted Cruz announced he is running for president on Monday with an uncompromising speech to Liberty University in Virginia , making the firebrand Republican the first official entrant in the 2016 race .
â€œI believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of America , â€ � Cruz said , â€œand that is why today I am announcing I am running for president of the United States.â€ � â€œWe stand together for liberty ,
â€ �
he told an arena of students at the intensely Christian university , which advertises itself as a training ground for â€œchampions of Christâ€ � in rural Virginia .
Cruz called for the crowd to join his â€œgrassroots army across this nationâ€ � and fight to â€œreclaim the constitutionâ€ � with other â€œcourageous conservativesâ€ � .
Cruz pre - empted his own announcement overnight , posting a campaign video online that declared his candidacy .
The choice of Liberty University underscores Cruzâ€ ™ s eagerness to win evangelical voters and define himself as a leader of a younger â€œnew generation of courageous conservativesâ€
� that he spoke of in his first campaign video .
In the speech , Cruz exhorted the crowd to imagine everything from â€œabolishing the IRSâ€ � to fighting abortion laws to a president who stands â€œunapologeticallyâ€ � with Israel , hammering talking points about cutting taxes , repealing the presidentâ€ ™ s healthcare law and fighting for conservative causes .
He also called on the crowd to imagine itself in the shoes of the men who signed the constitution in revolutionary America , and framed himself as a leader capable of the achievements of both Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Republican Ronald Reagan .
He also added a distinctly Christian flavor to the speech , repeatedly saying â€œour rights donâ€
™ t come from man , they come from God almightyâ€ � and suggesting he would fight to relax education laws , allowing some of the controversial materials for which Liberty University is known .
Cruzâ€ ™ s swaggering entrance on to the 2016 field complicates life for several other Republicans who are already running in all but name .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , brother of former president George W Bush and son of president George HW Bush , has spent months raising millions of dollars from donors of the Republican establishment .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul , the preferred libertarian candidate , has asked his home stateâ€ ™ s lawmakers to arrange a loophole that allows his candidacy .
Primary voting begins next January with Republicansâ€ ™ Iowa caucuses , and more than a dozen politicians could take the field , including Florida senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker .
Students who spoke with the Guardian all had positive reactions to Cruz , but not all said that the senator had their vote .
Matthew Lofgren , a freshman from Naples , Florida , said that he appreciated Cruzâ€ ™ s Christian values but that the senator â€œhad a lot of imagining going on ; it was a little unbelievableâ€ � .
Lofgren said he preferred Rand Paul , who he said would be a â€œmore realisticâ€ � candidate who could â€œunite more Democrats and Republicansâ€ � .
â€œCruz would just divide them , â€ �
Lofgren said .
Jonathan Watkins , a junior from Kentucky , also said he preferred Paul , his stateâ€ ™ s senator , although he said he would support Cruz and thought both senators â€œhave a good idea of the big pictureâ€ � .
â€œCruz has the values and Paul has the experience , â€ � Watkins said .
Watkins agreed with freshman Jim Brassell , of South Carolina , who said a dual ticket of Paul - Cruz would be â€œunstoppableâ€ � .
Brassell said he too was on the fence .
â€œI love Rand Paul to death , â€ � he said ,
â€œbut I like that Cruz had the balls to say that Iâ€ ™ m standing here before God asking for this .
Itâ€ ™ s not easy to defend your faith on national television like that.â€ � Samantha Mayo and Nicole Gage , both of Washington DC , both said they would support Cruz , adding that they particularly liked his comments about supporting Israel and preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon .
â€œIf he can stay out of controversy heâ€ ™ ll have a good shot , â€ �
Mayo said , â€œand I like that heâ€ ™ s standing up for his Christian values .
I think
thatâ€ ™ s what we need.â€
�
They said they found Cruzâ€ ™ s speech â€œinspiringâ€ � .
Cruz , 44 , has shot to national renown despite only two years in the Senate , boosted by insurgent Tea Party factions and his uncompromising will to stir up trouble in the Capitol .
In October 2013 , he orchestrated a plan to block the presidentâ€ ™ s healthcare law that forced the federal government to shut down for 16 days and did not block the plan .
Veterans in Congress have expressed a distaste for Cruzâ€ ™ s theatrics , with Arizona senator John McCain at one point calling his colleague one of several â€œwacko birdsâ€ � to have joined the party .
But deeply conservative voters , especially those who care most about social issues and slashing government budgets , have taken to Cruz with a passion .
The senator came in third at a straw - poll at this yearâ€ ™ s conference of the Conservative Political Action Committee ( CPAC ) , an annual rallying point for the Republican party .
A graduate of Harvard Law and Princeton University , born of a Cuban immigrant father and with dual Canadian - US citizenship , Cruz both checks boxes for electoral success and refuses to stay within the lines defined by his party .
As a student , he starred in a performance of The Crucible , the Arthur Miller play about witch hunts , and also worked on the prestigious Harvard Law Review .
Cruz went on to become solicitor general of Texas , winning five of the nine cases he argued before the US supreme court , and keeps in his office a large oil painting that depicts three courtroom artists drawing Cruz during arguments , thus portraying Cruz in quadruplicate .
Since Republicans took command of Congress in the 2014 election , Cruz has stirred controversy by asking Nasa scientists not to study global warming and alarming a three - year - old girl by crying â€œthe worldâ€ ™ s on fireâ€ � at her .
Cruz has expressed skepticism toward climate science without denying its validity outright , and was found by fact - checking organization Politifact to have â€œcherry - pickedâ€ � data .
Cruz vociferously supports cutting government budgets , especially for departments such as the Environmental Protection Agency .
He has also pitched himself as a defender of the words â€œunder Godâ€ � in the pledge of allegiance and a guardian of Christian causes in court .
If elected , Cruz would be the first Hispanic president .
Although born in Canada he qualifies as a â€œnatural born citizenâ€ � , as the constitution requires of presidents , thanks to the fact that his mother was a US citizen who lived in the US for more than 10 years .
He says he has renounced his Canadian citizenship ."
2015-03-23,"Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act with a meeting and a social - media hug to distance her campaign from rivals seeking to repeal the presidentâ€ ™ s health reforms .
As the conservative senator Ted Cruz became the first Republican candidate to formally seek his partyâ€ ™ s nomination for 2016 , the likely leading Democratic contender met Obama in an hour - long White House meeting that remained off his official public schedule .
â€œ16 m covered .
Young ppl .
Preexisting conditions .
Women get better coverage .
Repeal those things ?
Embrace them!,â€
� said a message on Clintonâ€ ™ s Twitter account , posted moments after the White House confirmed their Monday rendezvous â€ “ along with a picture of her embracing the president in 2010 , when his signature healthcare law first passed .
Recent statistical estimates from the Department of Health and Human Services showing a 35 % fall in the number of Americans without health insurance since the legislation came into affect have been seized upon by Democrats as a sign that the reforms are irreversible despite several outstanding legal and political challenges .
But earlier , at a event in Virginia , Cruz made repeal of the controversial legislation the centrepiece of his new campaign .
The White House , which earlier refused to acknowledge the presidentâ€ ™ s meeting with Clinton in advance when asked by reporters , subsequently issued a short statement confirming the event .
â€œAs
I noted in todayâ€ ™ s briefing , President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy catching - up in person when their schedules permit ,
â€ � the press secretary , Josh Earnest , said .
â€œThis afternoon they met privately for about an hour at the White House and discussed a range of topics.â€ �
This article was amended on 24 March 2015 to reflect that a photograph tweeted by Hillary Clinton was taken in 2010 ."
2015-03-23,"â€œAmen , â€ � sighed Hillary Clinton , as she debated urban development at a Washington thinktank that was 180 miles â€ “ and 180 degrees â€ “ away from the fiery campaign launch of Republican rival Ted Cruz at the same time in Virginia .
â€œI love sessions like this because itâ€ ™ s really nice to get back into an evidenced - based discussion
, â€ � she added , in oblique reference to the email scandal that has so far overshadowed her own attempt to begin a more earnest , policy - focused campaign .
None of the panel at the Center for American Progress â€ “ a centre - left thinktank set up by Clinton during her last tilt at the White House
â€ “ were rude enough to bring it up again during what proved a more tightly controlled appearance than her disastrous press conference on the affair two weeks ago .
But the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s relief at being back on ideological home turf could not have been more palpable .
Three times during her brief remarks , she also paid tribute to the Clinton Global Initiative and Clinton Foundation , family - run institutions whose reliance on corporate and overseas donors has also attracted more negative public attention of late .
A starker contrast still for Clinton was to the more colourful , if less cautious , political message being unveiled further south by Cruz .
White the Texas senator was reaching out to evangelicals and conservatives with a full - throated assault on the Washington consensus , Clinton was here to preach to its policy wonks , and hopefully show her concern for Democratic causes in danger of becoming captured by leftwing rival Elizabeth Warren .
â€œA lot of our cities truly are divided , â€ � said Clinton .
â€œThey have a lot a of inequality that has only gotten worse ...
They have people that are trapped in generational poverty and whose skills are not keeping up with what the jobs or today and tomorrow demand.â€ � This was no policy speech , more a mood music hymn , replete with the requisite buzz phrases such as â€œabolishing silosâ€ � and â€œcreating the conditions for coordination and collaborationâ€ � .
But this was also a putative presidential candidate willing to quote research by Harvard professors on the causes of social immobility and draw uncomfortable comparisons between parts of the country that had got it right and those that had not .
â€œTwo cities with similar affluence â€ “ Seattle and Atlanta â€ “ have markedly different rates of economic mobility , â€ � said Clinton .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not about race ...
It turns out that places where the fabric of community is strong , with a vibrant middle class , places that are more integrated across class , places with good skills , places with unions , places with religious and civil organisations , help people feel rooted in being part of a community and be able to pull together all of the aspects that play into upward mobility.â€ �
While Cruz railed against big government , the queen of Washingtonâ€ ™ s political class was also unafraid to sing its praises and hint at a more European - style economic intervention .
â€œWe have 5.6 million people in America between 16 and 24 who are neither in school nor at work , and if we donâ€ ™ t consciously try to reach out to these people and train them , [ then ] they donâ€ ™ t have the hard skills but they also donâ€ ™ t have the soft skills , â€ � she added .
â€œThe other thing that Germany has is instead of an unemployment system they have a wage subsidy system , so you donâ€ ™ t let people go in the first place , and I think there are lots of creative ideas both in our own country and elsewhere in comparable economies.â€ �
There may be many more speeches and events like this before Clinton even formally declares she is in the race for the White House .
But if the first public appearance since the first wave of scandals began to die down is anything to go by , Hillary is planning to carry on being Hillary ."
2015-03-24,"Twenty hours after declaring his candidacy for the presidency , Senator Ted Cruz is seeing â€œbreathtakingâ€ � energy on the campaign trail , he said in an interview on Tuesday morning .
â€œThe energy and exhilaration there yesterday and weâ€ ™ re seeing on the trail , it takes your breath away , â€ �
Cruz said in an appearance on NBCâ€ ™ s Today show , alongside his wife , Heidi .
It was unclear what trail stops Cruz was referring to .
Following the announcement of his candidacy on Monday at a Liberty University event at which student attendance was mandatory , Cruz returned to Washington to make an appearance on Fox News .
Sniping among Republican competitors for the 2016 presidential nomination heated up late Monday , with Senator Rand Paul slipping on to Fox News ahead of Cruz to poke fun at the fact that Cruz had launched his presidential campaign at an event with required attendance .
Paul , who is expected to declare his own candidacy within weeks , was asked about a group of students at the event who stood behind Cruz wearing red â€œStand with Randâ€ � T - shirts .
Paul said his team had not arranged the tableau .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure who did orchestrate it , â€ � Paul said .
â€œBut I kind of remember those days , because I went to Baylor University , and we were all required to go to convocation .
So all these kids were required , and some of those who were required wanted to make sure that just by having to be here , they werenâ€ ™ t expressing their support.â€ �
Paul suggested that Cruz , who is campaigning on a platform of abolishing the IRS and repealing â€œevery wordâ€ � of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s healthcare reforms , was â€œthrowing out red meatâ€ � to the conservative base without reaching out to the moderate voters who will be crucial to general election success .
â€œIf you look at our voting records ,
youâ€ ™ ll find weâ€ ™ re very , very similar , â€ �
Paul said of Cruz .
â€œI
guess what makes us different is probably our approach as to how we would make the party bigger .
And Iâ€ ™ m a big believer that you should stand on principle and be true to your principles ,
but I also think that we should take those principles and try to bring in new people with them.â€ �
In his Today show appearance , Cruz rejected the notion that he was an intransigent extremist whose unbending positions in the Senate had made him an enemy of compromise â€ “ the most glaring evidence of which , his critics say , being the partial shutdown of the federal government he helped precipitate in October 2013 with a profoundly feckless attempt to block the presidentâ€ ™ s healthcare law .
â€œIâ€ ™ m perfectly happy to work with anyone : Democrat , independent , libertarian , â€ �
Cruz said , â€œif theyâ€ ™ re shrinking the size and power of the federal government , shrinking the debt and expanding liberty.â€ � Asked about the secret Ted Cruz the public does not see , Heidi Cruz did not refer to a hidden penchant for compromise but to Cruzâ€ ™ s sense of conviction .
â€œIt was one of the things that really drew me to him , is that this is a person with conviction , â€ � said Heidi , who has taken leave from her job as a managing director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc to help the campaign .
Cruz , a champion debater in his college years with a distinguished record of arguing cases before the US supreme court , argued in his Hannity appearance against the idea that he was too radical to be electable .
Cruz specifically set his sights on an analysis published on Monday by the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight , which Cruz incorrectly referred to as being part of the New York Times , a bugbear for the Fox News audience .
FiveThirtyEight split with the Times two years ago , when founder Nate Silver moved the enterprise to ESPN / ABC News .
On Monday the siteâ€ ™ s senior political writer , Harry Enten , formerly of the Guardian US , published a piece called â€œLetâ€ ™ s Be Serious about Ted Cruz from the Start :
Heâ€ ™ s Too Extreme and Too Disliked to Win.â€ � â€œYou know , Sean , when the New York Times says the Washington elites despise me , my only question is whether I have to disclose that to the [ Federal Election Commission ] as an in - kind donation , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t think of a better ground to run on.â€
�"
2015-03-24,"Senator Ted Cruzâ€
™ s announcement at Liberty University of his campaign for President of the United States on Monday was breathlessly overwrought and preposterously vague , in the classic Ted Cruz style of seeming on the verge of weeping at its own vacuity .
His only new tic was beginning a series of statements with , â€œImagine ...
â€ � before running down
John Lennonâ€ ™ s song in ideological reverse , a rhetorical effort to conjure political change akin to rubbing a magic lamp .
Cruz is one of the most exhausting candidates of the 2016 elections because he is such a confirmed ideologue and so enamored of his oratory that he doesnâ€
™ t bother to change it much , which is odd , because one of his selling points is that heâ€ ™ s smart enough to write a new speech at the drop of a hat .
That he refuses to tailor his words to a specific audience does lead to amusing moments â€ “ like his canned speech to a firefightersâ€ ™ union that was greeted with absolute silence and after which one member said that he needed to take a shower â€ “ but mostly it just confirms Cruzâ€ ™ s message that you donâ€ ™ t change perfection .
( Whether heâ€ ™ s talking about himself or America is a distinction without a difference . )
The speech at Liberty University appears more flawed if youâ€ ™ re not part of his target audience â€ “ which didnâ€ ™ t include all of the 10,000 people obligated to attend as part of the terms of their enrollment , some of whom took to the internet to anonymously mock his speech .
Liberty is , to be sure , a conservative diploma mill founded to vacuum money out of the pockets of people who think that the AP American History test hates America .
But itâ€ ™ s also an institution hostile toward any part of government unable to bomb people , and itâ€ ™ s the birthplace of the Clinton Body Count , of one of the most deranged right - wing conspiracies about Bill and Hillary Clinton .
The universityâ€ ™ s name alone fits with Cruzâ€ ™ s tendency to invoke problems and then rhetorically combat them with â€œlibertyâ€ � and â€œfreedomâ€ � , which rain federalism and deregulation pixie dust upon them until they disappear .
But more importantly , 47 % of Iowa Republicans consider themselves â€œvery conservativeâ€ � and 57 % describe themselves as born - again or evangelical â€ “ the kind of people for whom a Liberty audienceâ€ ™ s applause might really resonate .
And , right now , only 5 % of Iowa Caucus participants name Cruz their first choice , and only 7 % pick him as their second choice .
So while his announcement told people with money that his presidential ambitions werenâ€ ™ t merely the idling state of his ego but rather something that now may be funded , those gauzy stories about his fatherâ€ ™ s immigration and conversion â€ “ as well as Tedâ€ ™ s
abiding faith â€ “ were designed to deliver a message to Iowa voters : I am the American dream , and the dream comes from God .
But if Cruzâ€ ™ s appeals to the Christian nation at Liberty seemed vague , he got into specifics with Sean Hannity later on Monday .
Cruz is nothing if not consistent in his urgency , so his dive into specifics was as vaguely rapturous and imperiled as his red - meat speeches .
Cruz talking about energy policy is a lot like asking a little boy to describe the working of a steam locomotive : Coal goes in , and everything moves forward really fast .
For example , Cruz touted his â€œAmerican Energy Renaissance Actâ€ � on Hannity , a bill he will probably cite a great deal on the campaign trail because heâ€ ™ s passed zero meaningful legislation .
The AERA will , he said , â€œunchain the private sectorâ€ � and â€œcreate millions of high - paying jobs.â€
�
The former is just code for â€œcompletely deregulate fracking , coal mining and oil drilling , while crippling the EPAâ€ � , and he doesnâ€ ™ t have an explanation for how that creates millions of good jobs .
Oil companies in particular are already shedding workers due to low energy prices , and Cruzâ€ ™ s plan relies on the Keystone XL , whose long - term job numbers â€ “
35 â€ “ Republicans have consistently overestimated by about 42,000 .
But screw the domestic policy : Cruz believes we need to free the private sector so we can export liquid natural gas to Europe to cut off Vladimir Putinâ€ ™ s energy profits that hold Europe hostage by keeping Russiaâ€ ™ s lights on and its missiles in Ukraine ....
as long as Putin doesnâ€ ™ t try to do something before 2017 , the earliest we could start significant exports .
The rest of the interview was even more vague .
We apparently have to repeal Obamacare and replace it with insurance â€œcompetitionâ€ � that keeps government from â€œstanding between you and your doctorâ€ � .
Cruz has been saying this since 2012 ; the specifics of his plan are still pending .
We need to abolish the IRS , a frequent Cruz assertion that at least this time didnâ€ ™ t come with bogus statistics , and replace it with an insanely regressive flat tax that Americans can fill out â€œon the back of a postcard.â€ �
We need a balanced - budget amendment , which every economist who doesnâ€ ™ t work at a think tank with a name like
Well Armed Traditional Family Freedom Flag Yurt will tell you is dumb as hell .
Despite earlier Chicken Littling about Putin and about Chinaâ€ ™ s increasingly assertive stance in the South China Sea , Cruz declared without specifics that â€œIran in the single greatest national security threat facing the country.â€ �
Also , â€œThis administration has been the most antagonistic to Israel in the history of this country.â€ �
Uh , no .
Itâ€ ™ s easy to write off this interview as a softball , which it was : Hannity recently emceed at CPAC , where his primary task was administering a tongue bath to anything candidate - shaped that moved within his field of vision .
But Cruz is a softball candidate .
Heâ€
™ s had three years to take his obvious Ivy League intelligence and fluency in political texts to deliver a comprehensive policy speech , and yet he always returns to the same melodramatic material :
Abolish the IRS , repeal Obamacare , Obama is an outlaw , deregulate all energy production , kill whatever it is overseas that needs killing most this week , break the government , religious quotes , look like heâ€ ™ s about to break down from so many emotions .
Repeat .
Liberty University handed Ted Cruz a captive audience in front of whom he could roll out his campaign platform ; Hannity turned over to him an entire hour of his show .
His message at both , as it has been for three years was , â€œDetails pending.â€ � Why not ?
So far itâ€ ™ s worked .
Maybe what he says is enough for his audience .
Ted Cruz tells people that theyâ€ ™ re smart and that his truth is self - explanatory and , for the most part , audiences love it .
It was only a passing exchange , but one thing he said to Hannity said everything you need to know .
Cruz : ( to hannity ) Youâ€ ™ re a numbers guy .
Hannity :
Yeah .
Words used to mean things in America .
Cruzâ€ ™ s real schtick is moving to the extreme right of his own party , condemning party leaders as feckless RINOs and then holding the entire US political process hostage until his own party leaders have to compromise with Democrats to accomplish anything and ultimately prove Cruzâ€ ™ s point .
This internecine fighting routinely culminating in failure is something he describes as having â€œthe courage to lead , â€ � and all the fallout merely confirms his necessity on the national stage .
For instance , early in the Hannity interview , the man who led the government shutdown over Obamacare explained his candidacy by saying , â€œWashington is broken.â€ �
By God , If he does well in Iowa , he can prove the Republican primary process is , too ."
2015-03-27,"Ted Cruz officially kicked off the long US presidential campaign when he declared his candidacy this week , but his anti - environmental rhetoric has already set the stage for a looming war over whether climate - change denial is a legitimate barrier to the most powerful job in the world .
Leading scientists are preparing for an American election in which global warming may receive much higher billing than before â€ “ and Republicansâ€ ™ statements will be exposed to a level of scrutiny they have not formally had to deal with .
Cruz , the red - meat Texas senator with an army of conservative followers , raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he told the Texas Tribune that people who believe global warming is real are â€œthe equivalent of the flat - Earthersâ€ � .
â€œIt used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat , and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier , â€ �
Cruz said .
The comments were emblematic of the environmental threat that has plagued the Republican party for years .
Buoyed by the oil and gas companies and fossil - fuel - funder mega - donors that increasingly bankroll their campaigns , most prominent Republican politicians have either denied that climate change exists or refused to stake out a clear position , citing their personal lack of scientific knowledge .
But as the subjectâ€ ™ s specter looms larger by the day , and as presumed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has stepped up her calls on the need to battle climate change as a potential signature issue , the â€œIâ€ ™ m not a scientistâ€ � line is infuriating scientists .
â€œI think , frankly , the Republican party is going to have to make a decision , â€ � Michael Mann , director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center , who contributed to a Nobel Prize - winning landmark report on global warming , told the Guardian .
â€œAre they going to move in the direction of logic and rationality , or are they going to continue to pursue this anti - scientific fringe movement within their party that is personified by people liked Ted Cruz ?
â€œAs long as the Koch brothers are pouring tens of millions of dollars into their campaigns , â€ � Mann said , referring to the top conservative donors , â€œthereâ€ ™ s going to be enough oxygen to keep these folks going.â€ �
The real test , Mann said , lies with establishment - backed candidates like former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who recently declared himself a climate skeptic despite his previous assertion that the climate may be warming .
As the governor of a state regarded as the hotbed for hurricanes and coastal erosion , Bush fought against drilling off the Florida coast and launched a massive Everglades restoration project .
Among the potential candidates expected to announce their intentions beginning in an April wave , only Kentucky senator Rand Paul and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham have bucked their party by acknowledging that climate change is real .
The conservative field for the 2016 election is otherwise made up of proud deniers , such as Cruz , and those who would rather plead ignorance , along with Florida senator Marco Rubio and Texas governor Rick Perry .
This ambiguity falls short of the criteria by which scientists believe the media â€ “ and undecided young voters
â€ “ should judge each candidateâ€ ™ s response .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not a doctor , but I know not to drink arsenic , â€ � Mann said .
â€œEach of these candidates is going to have to decide how theyâ€ ™ re going to contend with this.â€ �
Recent polls that show support among the majority of Americans , including half of Republicans , for government action to curtail greenhouse gas emissions may make uncomfortable reading for GOP candidates .
Two - thirds of Americans said they would be more likely to vote for candidates who campaigned on fighting climate change .
Among Republican voters , 48 % said they preferred candidates who would take on climate change .
Growing concern among the American electorate suggests climate change may emerge as a major issue in 2016 , something that would mark a change from prior elections in which it was scarcely discussed in debates or on the campaign trail , failing to make it into the topics that mattered most to voters .
In 2012 , Republican nominee Mitt Romney was not alone in ignoring climate change .
Even Barack Obama , who has taken a more aggressive approach in cutting carbon emissions during his second term , took heat from environmental activists in his base for being elusive over global warming during his presidential campaign .
More recently , the president has made the fight against climate change one of the top priorities of his administration .
The Pentagonâ€ ™ s declaration that global warming is a national security threat has also raised the debateâ€ ™ s national political profile .
Even so , scientists are not holding their breath for any outright climate change acknowledgements by Republican candidates .
â€œIt would be suicide in their primaries , â€ � John Abraham , a professor of thermal sciences at the University of St Thomas School of Engineering in Minnesota , told the Guardian .
The fate of the political discourse over climate change , he argued , in many ways lies in the hands of voters in town halls as well as reporters and debate moderators â€ “ and whether they accept outright denial from Cruz and vague obfuscation from other candidates at face value .
â€œIf this were a political issue , the media would be entirely within its rights to provide equal voice to both sides , â€ � Abraham said .
â€œHowever , this is a story that is grounded in science â€
“ itâ€
™ s a lot like what causes Ebola , what causes flu , or how do we treat cancer .
â€œGlobal warming is not a political problem â€ “ itâ€ ™ s a scientific problem.â€ �"
2015-03-28,"News that a Texas city is to be powered by 100 % renewable energy sparked surprise in an oil - obsessed , Republican - dominated state where fossil fuels are king and climate change activists were described as â€œthe equivalent of the flat - earthersâ€ � by US senator and GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz .
â€œI was called an Al Gore clone , a tree - hugger , â€ � says Jim Briggs , interim city manager of Georgetown , a community of about 50,000 people some 25 miles north of Austin .
Briggs , who was a key player in Georgetownâ€ ™ s decision to become the first city in the Lone Star State to be powered by 100 % renewable energy , has worked for the city for 30 years .
He wears a belt with shiny silver decorations and a gold ring with a lone star motif , and is keen to point out that he is not some kind of California - style eco - warrior with a liberal agenda .
In fact , he is a staunchly Texan pragmatist .
â€œIâ€ ™ m probably the furthest thing from an Al Gore clone you could find , â€ � he says .
â€œWe didnâ€ ™ t
do this to save the world
â€ “
we did this to get a competitive rate and reduce the risk for our consumers.â€ �
In many Texas cities the electricity market is deregulated , meaning that customers choose from a dizzying variety of providers and plans .
In Houston , for example , there are more than 70 plans that offer energy from entirely renewable sources .
That makes it easy to switch , so in a dynamic marketplace , providers tend to focus on the immediate future .
This discourages the creation of renewable energy facilities , which require long - term investment to be viable .
But in Georgetown , the city utility company has a monopoly .
When its staff examined their options last year , they discovered something that seemed remarkable , especially in Texas :
renewable energy was cheaper than non - renewable .
And so last month city officials finalised a deal with SunEdison , a giant multinational solar energy company .
It means that by January 2017 , all electricity within the cityâ€ ™ s service area will come from wind and solar power .
In 2014 , the city signed a 20-year agreement with EDF for wind power from a forthcoming project near Amarillo .
Taking the renewable elements up to 100 % , SunEdison will build plants in west Texas that will provide Georgetown with 150 megawatts of solar power in a deal running from 2016 or 2017 to 2041 .
With consistent and reliable production the goal , the combination takes into account that wind farms generate most of their energy in the evenings , after the sun has set .
Despite its proximity to the left - leaning Austin , Georgetown is not instinctively progressive .
Its main selling point is the old - school charm of its historic core , which credibly bills itself as the Most Beautiful Town Square In Texas .
It is not a natural political companion to Burlington , a similar - sized city in liberal Vermont that last year reportedly became the first in the US to use 100 % renewable energy .
Though Georgetown is home to Southwestern University , a liberal arts college , Briggs said that more than 40 % of residents are over 50 .
The area is conservative and much of the positive reaction to the announcement has come less because the citizens are desperate to help the planet than because they are getting the security of a fixed rate plan that will be similar to the current cost of about 9.6 cents per kilowatt - hour and will protect them against the impact of fluctuations in the price of fossil fuels .
Chris Foster , Georgetownâ€ ™ s manager of resource planning and integration , said that since the announcement he had â€œgotten calls from businesses as far away as California and Maryland wanting to know : what does it cost to move over here ?
[ They say : ] â€˜Weâ€ ™ re out here trying to be renewable ; itâ€ ™ s cheaper over there to be renewableâ€ ™ .â€ �
He said that for manufacturing companies conscious of their carbon footprint , basing themselves in a place that offers 100 % wind and solar energy would be an easy way to boost their green credentials .
In a state that loves to bash Washington , what little criticism there has been , Briggs said , has stemmed from the federal tax breaks handed out to encourage renewable energy .
â€œWell then , we should never have mass transit and quit farming â€ ¦ that argument , while itâ€ ™ s there , is really pretty shallow ,
â€ � he says .
Fearing an imminent end to the governmentâ€ ™ s generosity , private green energy companies have scrambled to build facilities .
At the same time , in recent years a glut of Chinese - made panels has made solar power more cost - effective .
And while west Texas is an oil drillerâ€ ™ s paradise , it is also sunny and gusty , making it a perfect corridor for renewable energy .
The region bordering New Mexico is one of the prime solar resource sites in the US and the wind whistles across the plains to such an extent that , as Scientific American pointed out last year , the state is Americaâ€ ™ s largest wind power producer â€ “ as well as leading the nation in the production of crude oil and the emission of greenhouse gases .
Renewable energy also uses much less water than traditional power generation â€ “ a bonus in a state where half the land and more than nine million people are affected by drought conditions , though Briggs said that for Georgetown , water conservation was only a â€œside benefitâ€ � .
Greg Abbott , formerly Texas attorney general and now governor , repeatedly sued the federal government over its attempts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .
Last year , the chairman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , Bryan Shaw , said there is a â€œlack of links between greenhouse gases and the climateâ€ � .
Shaw was appointed by former governor Rick Perry , a notorious climate - change sceptic and a prospective Republican White House candidate for 2016 .
Yet amid the rhetoric , denial and promotion of corporate interests and economic prosperity ahead of environmental concerns , over the past decade Texas lawmakers authorised the spending of $ 7bn of taxpayersâ€ ™ money on the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone , a vast infrastructure project to connect west Texas wind power to major urban areas .
So Texas has the weather , the infrastructure and â€ “ certainly in small places such as Georgetown â€
“ the current market conditions to be greener .
But a state report last September cast a cloud over the future of renewable energy in Texas , saying it was not reliable or extensive enough to meet peak demand .
â€œRenewables need conventional power backup , â€ � it said .
Fred Beach , assistant director for policy studies at the University of Texas at Austinâ€ ™ s Energy Institute , said that â€œat the moment , unfortunately , the legislature is pretty clueless when it comes to renewablesâ€ � and is failing to get the most out of their investment .
Beach suspects that Big Oil will fret that Georgetownâ€ ™ s pioneering move is the start of a trend , and polluting , inefficient coal power plants will be pushed out of service by more deployment of wind and solar energy .
But he believes that would likely prove good news for natural gas generators , who will be relied upon in the scorching summer months when demand is highest .
Ultimately , he said , in a practical - minded place like Texas , the best way to encourage the use of green energy is to appeal to heads rather than hearts and make a strong business case , as happened in Georgetown .
Russ Dickson , co - owner of an antiques shop on the main square , said he was delighted at the move .
â€œThis is a pretty conservative community and to see a conservative community step up [ and do this ] makes me feel good about the future , â€ � the 61-year - old said .
Outside , Jon Klopf , a barber , sat on a bench enjoying a splendidly sunny Thursday afternoon .
â€œThey were just looking out for the cheapest deal .
Thatâ€ ™ s just business , â€ � the 50-year - old said .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t really think we should be relying too much on oil , even though they have to right now .
That donâ€ ™ t last forever .
â€œSun will , though .
Long as the sun comes up , the wind will blow.â€ �"
2015-03-31,"Republican presidential hopefuls may be seeking to distinguish themselves , but contenders from the moderate establishment favorite Jeb Bush to the social - conservative evangelist Ted Cruz seem to agree on the hard - right controversy of the week : religious freedom includes the right to discriminate against the LGBT community .
Just as quickly as a new civil rights battle emerged over an Indiana law that opponents argue will allow businesses to deny service to LGBT people , GOP rivals were rushing to defend the man who signed it into law â€ “ and risked looking out of touch with an increasingly open - minded electorate .
Governor Mike Pence insisted on Tuesday that his state legislature would seek to â€œclarifyâ€ � the so - called Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
Even as backlash poured in from Appleâ€ ™ s CEO to the NCAA to many more companies , celebrities and outside states , the 2016 Republican candidates in waiting remained unfazed â€ “ all in the name of protecting religious liberty .
During a radio interview on Monday , Bush said Pence had done â€œthe right thingâ€ � by signing the law .
â€œI think once the facts are established , people arenâ€ ™ t going to see this as discriminatory at all , â€ �
he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt .
â€œThere are many cases where people acting on their conscience have been cascaded by the government , â€ � Bush said .
â€œThis law simply says the government has to have a level of burden to be able to establish there has been some kind of discrimination .
Weâ€ ™ re going to need this .
This is really an important value in our country , where you can respect and be tolerant of peopleâ€ ™ s lifestyles but allow for people of faith to exercise theirs.â€ �
In a statement , the Human Rights Campaign president , Chad Griffin , said : â€œGovernor Bushâ€ ™ s decision to defend this widely condemned law raises an important question : does he support legal non - discrimination protections for LGBT Americans , or does he believe businesses should have the legal right to fire gay and lesbian employees , evict LGBT Americans from their apartments , or refuse them service at a restaurant?â€
�
It was a rare moment for Bush , who often plays safe on social issues , to sound almost like the further - right Cruz , who hailed Pence for â€œholding the line to protect religious liberty in the Hoosier Stateâ€ � .
â€œIndiana is giving voice to millions of courageous conservatives across this country who are deeply concerned about the ongoing attacks upon our personal liberties .
Iâ€ ™ m proud to stand with Mike , and I urge Americans to do the same
, â€ � Cruz , the only officially declared presidential candidate thus far , said in a statement .
Other Republicans mulling a bid for the White House piled on , including Louisianaâ€ ™ s governor , Bobby Jindal , who declared his support for the Indiana law , as well as former presidential candidate Rick Santorum and neurosurgeon Ben Carson .
Some were more circumspect , such as the Florida senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker .
But even their caution came with a disclaimer that religious freedom must be protected as a matter of principle .
â€œObviously , itâ€ ™ s raised a lot of debate in America about how far these laws go and what implications they would have , and itâ€ ™ s a difficult debate to have for a lot of people , â€ �
Rubio said of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , during an appearance Monday on Fox News .
â€œBut I think the flip side of all of this debate is what about the religious liberties of Americans who do not want to feel compelled by law to provide a catering service or photography service to a same - sex marriage that their faith teaches is wrong?â€ �
Rubio , who is expected to declare his candidacy next month , added that the â€œconsensus view in Americaâ€ � was that it should not be legal to deny someone services because of that individualâ€ ™ s sexual orientation .
But critics have pointed out that the law , which goes into effect on 1 July , does precisely that .
Such has been the uproar â€ “ ranging from scathing editorials to some businesses threatening to boycott Indiana altogether
â€ “ that Pence said on Tuesday he will quickly move a legislative fix that would make clear the law does not allow for discrimination .
At the White House on Tuesday , press secretary Josh Earnest said Penceâ€ ™ s comparison of his stateâ€ ™ s religious exemption law to federal statute was â€œnot trueâ€ � .
The scurrying among presidential candidates to defend the law nonetheless underscores what political watchers have acknowledged is a major early predicament facing Republicans as the 2016 race ramps up : staking out a middle ground on LGBT issues remains a tough sell to a base for which socially conservative values continue to rule .
An overwhelming majority of Americans oppose businesses that refuse service to gay and lesbian customers â€ “ whether on religious grounds or not â€ “ and pollsters say those numbers could loom even larger with young , undecided voters .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re headed to the point where a political candidate who is perceived as anti - gay at the presidential level will never connect with people under 30 years old , â€ �
GOP pollster Whit Ayers told reporters at a breakfast event in Washington on Tuesday .
Same - sex marriage and discrimination issues could come back to haunt an eventual Republican presidential nominee , especially given the increasingly broad support among the American electorate for gay rights .
The religious freedom law also puts the GOP at odds with some of its corporate donors , who have shied away from similar efforts in other states .
At least one top contender has been noticeably silent this week on the Indiana law
â€ “ and others like it : Kentucky senator Rand Paul .
When a similar law was under consideration in Arizona last year , Paul said that â€œthe right to associate and the right to be free in your business decisions is out thereâ€ � .
But Paul added : â€œIâ€ ™ m not real excited about laws that sort of say you can deny people service.â€ �
A spokesman for Paul did not immediately return a request for comment when asked for the senatorâ€ ™
s
views on Indianaâ€ ™ s religious freedom law .
For her part , the presumptive Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton called it â€œsadâ€ � ."
2015-04-06,"This Easter Monday , egg - rolling took place at the White House for the 137th time .
It is a tradition as American as baseball , apple pie and Ted Cruz .
Like the Republican senator , however , the ceremony did not originate in the US .
Unlike Cruz , who as we know was honed and perfected in Canada and/or outer space , it was formed and refined in Europe .
The White House website will tell you how the annual roll has been â€œan American tradition since 1878â€ � , but eggs were giddily being rolled around in England and Germany well before then .
Nowadays , the combination of eggs and Easter is associated with Christianity : egg - rolling , hunting and eating has become wrapped up with the celebration of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ .
As Christianity would have it , the rolling of an egg is symbolic of the stone rolling back from Christâ€ ™ s tomb , allowing him out to prank his disciples .
Or , if you prefer , it is the hard shell of the egg that represents the tomb : cracking it represents letting him out .
Either way , the celebration of eggs at this time of year was actually appropriated by Christianity from elsewhere .
People have been painting eggs for laughs for thousands of years .
As many as 60,000 years ago , bushmen in sub - Saharan Africa were using ostrich eggs for flasks and decorating them to tell whose was whose , according to research by Dr Brian Stewart , an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge .
More recently than that , eggs were popular in pagan Easter festivals , in which the hatching or breaking open of the egg was associated with the birth or renewal of the Earth in the springtime .
People would celebrate their gods at this time of year by holding festivals in which egg - painting and egg - racing were common .
The act of egg - rolling likely comes from such festivals , as does the egg hunt and the exchange of the Easter egg .
When Christianity swept through Europe such traditions were kept , just with different explanations given as to their symbolism .
So it was that egg - rolling became , and remained , popular in the UK and other European countries .
To this day , at Easter time , British children can be seen egg - rolling on any given hillock .
Flat caps on heads and painted , hard - boiled eggs in hand , they gather at their grassy summit before gleefully hurling their prize yonder .
The childrenâ€ ™ s clogs make no sound on the downy earth as they give chase to their eggs , calling out to one another as they run .
When the egg is finally located it is time to break open that carefully decorated shell and greedily consume the goodness within .
When European colonialists came to the US , they brought their egg - rolling with them , and thus we have the White House egg roll .
It began formally in 1878 , under President Rutherford B Hayes , although there had been informal egg events earlier .
The popular egg - rolling spot before then was at the Capitol , owing to its steep inclines , but in 1876 , Congress , tired of crowds chewing up the grass , banned the practice .
The following year was a grave time for egg - rollers everywhere , but in 1878 , according to the White House , Hayes invited some children to roll their eggs on the White Houseâ€ ™ s south lawn .
And thus , a tradition began ."
2015-04-12,"Rand Paul , one of two declared candidates for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 , on Sunday answered criticism of his behaviour towards female interviewers by saying such women â€œhave come a long wayâ€ � , are â€œintelligentâ€
� and â€œshould be equal to their counterparts and treated equallyâ€
� .
Paul was appearing on CNN after a week in which he announced his candidacy , following the Texas senator Ted Cruz , and was criticised for a subsequent interview with NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie .
Speaking to CNN host Dana Bash in an interview filmed in Iowa City after he ended an interview with the Guardian early , causing further widespread comment , Paul was asked if he would â€œpull his punchesâ€ � with women interviewers from now on .
â€œI think women have come a long way , â€ � he said .
â€œWomen are in these positions not because theyâ€ ™ re women but because theyâ€ ™ re intelligent and they should be equal to their counterparts and treated equally .
â€œBut I can tell you that the interviewers in the last couple of days , I think , probably got it easier than what I gave to [ former New York governor ]
Eliot Spitzer on your programme here.â€ �
Paul added : â€œI would not come into our interview thinking , â€˜OK , itâ€ ™ s a woman versus a man kind of interview.â€ ™
I just think sheâ€ ™ s going to have tough questions , Iâ€ ™ m going to have tough questions , and Iâ€ ™ ve got to be prepared.â€ �
Asked by NBCâ€ ™ s Guthrie about his changed positions on some foreign policy points , Paul had said : â€œWhy donâ€ ™ t we let me explain instead of talking over me , OK ?
Before we go through a litany of things you say Iâ€ ™ ve changed on , why donâ€ ™ t you ask me a question :
â€˜Have I changed my opinion?â€ ™ â€
�
The senator also accused Guthrie of â€œeditorialisingâ€ � his views , in an exchange which reminded some critics of a February interview with CNBC in which he â€œshushedâ€ � host Kelly Evans and told her to â€œcalm downâ€ � .
On CNN , Paul repeated his complaint about â€œeditorialisingâ€ � by journalists .
â€œIâ€ ™ m unwilling to let people characterise things unfairly , and if someoneâ€ ™ s going to write an op - ed on me ... thatâ€ ™ s fair for them to try to do it , but itâ€ ™ s also fair for me to try to set the record straight and say theyâ€ ™ re editorialising in the question ,
â€ � he said .
Asked about how he would approach a debate with one potential Democratic opponent for president , Hillary Clinton , who is due to declare her candidacy today , he said : â€œIâ€ ™ m always polite , and even in all the interviews when Iâ€ ™ m accused of being too aggressive , Iâ€ ™ ve never yelled or got out of control â€ ¦ â€œI would treat her with the same respect I would a man , but I wouldnâ€ ™ t lay down and say , â€˜Iâ€ ™ m not going to respond â€ ¦ â€ ™ That would be a sexist response , to say : â€˜Oh , my goodness , she deserves to be treated less aggressively because sheâ€ ™ s only a woman.â€ ™
I would never say that about anybody.â€ �"
2015-04-14,"For months , Marco Rubio has positioned himself as the defense hawk rising from the Republican rubble â€ “ a John McCain for the millennial set .
The junior senator from Florida has taken his position on the powerful Foreign Relations Committee to remind the world that he would re - open the prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , defend the NSAâ€ ™ s dragnet surveillance and â€œstand upâ€ � against North Korea .
Rubio has adopted the â€œObama - Clinton foreign policyâ€ � line used by Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and raised them an Ayatollah .
Anything less than the â€œRubio doctrineâ€ � , he says , would be â€œchaosâ€ � .
The highly public ramp - up of his borderless credentials has built to this moment : a self - made politician is now , at 43 years old , attempting a long - shot bid to secure his partyâ€ ™ s nomination for president as a veteran of global affairs .
But foreign policy experts warn that if Rubioâ€ ™ s ultimate campaign plan is to simply serve up scathing critiques of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s failures â€ “ and by proxy those of Hillary Clinton , whom he calls â€œthe architectâ€ � â€ “ heâ€ ™ ll have to do a better sales job if he wants to stand a chance against a former secretary of state . â€œToo many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the 20th century , â€ �
Rubio said in a clear dig at Clinton on Monday , announcing his candidacy in Miami the day after she entered the race with a decidedly domestic pitch .
â€œThey have forgotten that when America fails to lead , global chaos inevitably follows , so they appease our enemies , betray our allies and weaken our military.â€ �
After laying the groundwork on Sunday talk shows and the Senate floor , the Miami unveil served as the first openly presidential platform for Rubio to lay out a vision for Americaâ€ ™ s role on the world stage that is at once openly interventionist and politically confrontational : likening Clinton to â€œa leader from yesterdayâ€ � , Rubio soaked up major applause lines while criticizing a nuclear deal with Iran , the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s souring relationship with Israel and renewed US ties with Cuba .
Just donâ€ ™ t try to call him inexperienced .
â€œPresident Obamaâ€ ™ s been a failure not because he was only in the Senate for four years
â€ “ heâ€
™ s been a failure because his ideas are bad , â€ �
Rubio said in an interview on Fox News after his announcement .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t care if he had been in the Senate for 50 years ; if he had done what heâ€ ™ s done now , he would have failed , too .
His ideas donâ€ ™ t work.â€ �
Rubio has been espousing his foreign policy ideas on the airwaves since about a year ago , when he burst back onto the scene with an impassioned speech on the Senate floor against human and civil rights abuses in Cuba and Venezuela .
Rubio has since emerged â€ “ especially amidst the thaw with Havana â€ “ as one of the most vocal skeptics of Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy , dubbing the president â€œthe worst negotiatorâ€ � since Jimmy Carter .
Along with his fellow Republican presidential contenders who think they can go hawk - to - hawk against Clinton in a general election , Rubio has extended the attacks on Obamaâ€ ™ s global legacy directly to the former secretary of state .
â€œIn many respects I think
itâ€ ™ s going to be a continuation , â€ � he told Fox News on Monday .
â€œYou have to assume sheâ€ ™ s going to continue his trajectory in terms of foreign policy positions.â€
�
While Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy may barely pass muster in the polls , experts said even relatively inexperienced Republicans â€ “ governors and junior senators alike â€ “ need to pass certain tests themselves .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not enough to criticize what has been done or what the other person proposes to do â€ “
you have to have a credible case of your own , â€ �
Christopher Preble , vice - president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute , told the Guardian .
â€œWhat do you believe are the criteria for the use of force , and under what circumstances should the US military be involved in other conflicts?â€ �
For Rubio , that test often means using his position on the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees to oppose the actions of the Obama administration .
Most recently , he co - sponsored a bill that would allow Congress to reject a nuclear deal with Iran .
He has also floated an amendment that would force Iran to recognize Israelâ€ ™ s right to exist as part of any agreement .
Rubio has been vehemently opposed to the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba , citing his personal background as the son of Cuban immigrants .
He supported arming Syrian rebels but voted against a Senate resolution proposing US military intervention in 2013 , and has tied Obamaâ€ ™ s response to the civil war to the rise of the Islamic State .
The views are largely consistent with most members of the growing 2016 Republican field , save for the libertarian - leaning Rand Paul , who has advocated for a more isolationist approach .
But Rubio and his advisers have said his foreign policy experience tops that of prospective opponents from within his own party .
Elliott Abrams , a former adviser to George W Bush and Ronald Reagan who has also advised Rubio on foreign policy , told the Guardian that Rubioâ€ ™ s presence on the two Senate committees had allowed him to better understand not just the specific issues facing the country but also how to craft policy in response .
â€œRepublicans have a choice to make between people who have been governors â€ “ like Rick Perry , Jeb Bush and Scott Walker , and therefore have executive experience â€ “ and people like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who have much more foreign policy experience , â€ �
Abrams said .
â€œIf itâ€ ™ s a governor whoâ€ ™ s never served in a foreign policy position , theyâ€ ™ re going to have to make the argument that they do have relevant experience â€ “ and more relevant experience for being president than Hillary Clinton does.â€ �
Most polling indicates an uphill battle for Rubio against the likes of Bush , Walker and Paul .
But top GOP aides believe he is the most gifted orator in the race , and many have privately said Rubio is the partyâ€ ™ s second choice for the nomination â€ “ leaving room for him to rise should Bush or other early front - runners stumble .
â€œI am prepared to debate foreign policy with anyone else running on this race , â€ � he said on Fox .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t just have speeches â€ “
we can tell you specifically what laws we would pass or repeal on each one of these issues .
I think thatâ€ ™ s what distinguishes us.â€
�
If he did survive a primary , Rubio would have to contend with just how many of his foreign policy views are out of step with the broader American electorate .
The majority of the US public remains war - weary after decade - long missions in Iraq and Afghanistan , unless there is a compelling national security interest .
Millennials are especially opposed to military intervention , a factor that has made Paul the leading Republican contender among a younger cohort of voters
â€ “ even though Rubio is the youngest candidate in the race and has cast himself as part of a new generation of leadership .
Clinton , of course , is perceived by Democrats as just as hawkish as some Republicans and was defeated by Obama in 2008 in part for holding what voters saw at the time as an outdated approach to foreign policy , plus a vote for the Iraq war .
This time around , she could be dragged down by Obama again for the opposite reason â€ “ being linked to his policies as a former member of his administration .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s not merely in his party but executing , and in some cases crafting , the foreign policy of his administration , â€ � Preble said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to be hard for her to shift the blame
elsewhere.â€ � Americans continue to disapprove of Obamaâ€ ™ s efforts to defeat the Islamic State and his foreign policy overall .
For Rubio , the challenge will be to prove to the American people that Clinton is equally to blame for their frustration , while making the case his are the answers theyâ€ ™ ve been waiting for â€ “ or else .
â€œA Rubio doctrine would be that the United States is the indispensable power on the planet ,
â€ �
the senator told Fox News host Sean Hannity .
â€œIn the absence of American leadership , the result is a vacuum .
That vacuum is filled by chaos.â€ �"
2015-04-14,"You got ta hand it to the Republican Party .
When one of their own makes history in the diversity game â€ “ say , Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court , Sarah Palin as a vice president nominee , or Ronald Reagan becoming our nationâ€ ™ s first actor president â€ “ that trailblazer is so noxious that their origin group largely disowns them , leaving the party to lick its affirmative - action wounds .
Thatâ€ ™ s exactly whatâ€ ™ s going to happen to Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , the first - ever Latino Republicans to seriously campaign for their partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination ( sorry , Ben Fernandez ) .
SÃ­ , letâ€ ™ s pause and marvel at the progress of Latinos in this country , that they can become also - ran presidential candidates as vacuous and bloviating as gringos !
But now that our moment of respect is done , letâ€ ™ s get real .
Not only do Cruz or Rubio have little chance of becoming the GOPâ€ ™ s sacrificial lamb against Hillary Clinton in 2016 , they are by far the worst candidates that Republicans could pick to recruit the very constituency that they so desperately need to stay relevant in a changing country : Latinos .
Itâ€ ™ s not that Latino voters donâ€
™ t respect the stories of Cruz and Rubio , whose parents came from working - class roots to achieve the American dream .
Nor is it necessarily Latinosâ€ ™ supposed hatred of Cubans , as some pundits try to paint it : go to Dodger Stadium , and see how the Chicano crowds cheer on outfielder Yasiel Puig , or go to any fiesta and hear Perez Prado , Celia Cruz , and Beny
MorÃ
© draw people to the dance floor .
Rather , many Latinos donâ€
™ t like that Cruz and Rubio represent the politics of Cuban immigration to los Estados Unidos , a saga far different from that of virtually every other Latino group .
Blame the White Houseâ€ ™ s
Cold War game for the divide between Cuban Americans and other Latinos in America , not traditional Latin American rivalries .
While Latinos who escaped sometimes - unfathomable violence in their countries â€ “ Central Americans during the 1980s , South Americans during their dirty wars , or Mexicans during this decadeâ€ ™ s narcoterrorism â€ “ were rarely granted refugee status because American allies inflicted the violence theyâ€ ™ d fled , Cubans famously received the red carpet treatment when fleeing Castroâ€ ™ s Cuba in the 1960s and beyond .
Latinos who came to el Norte illegally for economic reasons had to evade la migra ; Cubans who arrived after the initial wave were subjected to Americaâ€ ™ s infamously simple Cuban immigration policy : make it to land , and you can stay .
( Haitians certainly didnâ€ ™ t have it so easy . )
Because of the double standard , many Latinos have long cast Cubans as entitled recipients of a hand - up that the rest of us never got .
And , Cuban - Americansâ€ ™ embrace of the Republicans who welcomed them while demonizing all other Latinos also created a political rift in the Latino community that any Cuban - American politician running outside of Florida and New Jersey must confront .
That chasm , undeserved or not , wouldâ€ ™ ve already weighed down Cruz and Rubio before they even tried to court Latino voters .
Then we get to their actual politics .
Cruz is a blip in Latino popular culture , both because of his alignment with the evangelical fringe of the GOP and because his Spanish is virtually non - existent .
The latter isnâ€ ™ t a fair knock , and Cruz did have a great comeback in 2010 when explaining why he wouldnâ€ ™ t do a debate on UnivisiÃ³n : his Spanish wasnâ€ ™ t great and â€œThatâ€ ™ s the world in which I grew up , and thatâ€ ™ s a world in which a lot of second - generation immigrants find themselvesâ€ � .
But refusing to speak Spanish will draw snickers all along the campaign trail , especially when Jeb Bush can speak better Spanish than most Democratic Latino politicians .
Rubio , on the other hand , would seem to be a Latino dream candidate : young , fluent in Spanish , directly tied to the immigrant experience and even self - deprecating .
His advisors are even whispering about how his pop culture fluency will particularly appeal to young Latinos .
But Latino millennials are the exact group that Rubio has antagonized the most , because on immigration , Rubio went from being somewhat sympathetic to the plight of undocumented youth to blabbering about closing borders before anything else .
His new hard - line approach brought the scorn of young immigration reform activists , who seem to take glee in rattling him .
On this issue , the supposed Latino hive mentality comes to bite Rubio in the nalgas : you ainâ€ ™ t exactly going to win the Latino vote when you suggest that a generation of them ought to be deported for the simple act of living in this country without papers .
That the Republicans think Rubio â€ “ and Cruz , to a lesser extent â€ “ is their Great Brown Hope instead of a Great Brown Nope despite all his negatives with Latinos ( he even introduced Mitt Romney during the 2012 Republican convention ) shows , once again , how much work the Reeps need to do to attract non - Cuban Latinos to their party .
Rubio , at least , has long known this divide was going to be an issue for him and tried to stave it off : in 2012 , he told a crowd , â€œDividing Cubans against the rest of the Hispanic community is not only absurd , itâ€ ™ s offensive.â€ � ( Note to Rubio : telling undocumented students that they â€œdonâ€ ™ t have a right to illegally immigrate into the United Statesâ€ � when your own abuelito was ordered to be deported
didnâ€
™ t help your case . )
But the real offensive thing is how out - of - touch Rubio and Cruz are with non - Cuban Latinos .
You know youâ€ ™ re bad when a gringo like Jeb is more attuned to Latino issues than the two of them combined â€ “ and Jeb is a pinche Bush , for Chrissakes !
( He is not , however , actually Latino , all voter registration forms to the contrary . )"
2015-04-14,"Before Hillary Clinton could even declare her candidacy for US president this week , Jeb Bush had tied her to Barack Obama and â€œdamaged relationshipsâ€ � around the world .
â€œIs the world
a safer place because Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State?â€
� asked Texas senator Ted Cruz .
â€œThe answer is obvious .
No.â€ �
Senator Rand Paul called the former secretary of state â€œthe worst of the Washington machine â€ “ the arrogance of power , corruption and cover - up , conflicts of interest and failed leadership with tragic consequencesâ€ � .
Forty - three - year - old senator Marco Rubio , in announcing his candidacy on Monday , went for a generational contrast : â€œyesterday is overâ€ � was his attack line .
Clinton may have been short on policy and long on message en route to Iowa during the opening leg of her campaign , but her Republican rivals are busy testing attack lines to take the momentum out from under her .
Longtime GOP strategists and upstart â€œStop
Hillaryâ€ � operatives outlined several distinct approaches to going after Clinton that may be used against her for months â€ “ if not years â€ “ to come : criticizing her record at the State Department , returning to the controversy over her personal email and lambasting the entirety of the 67-year - oldâ€ ™ s â€œscandal - ridden careerâ€ � .
What remains to be seen in the 574 days before Election Day is whether any of the anti - Clinton tricks will work â€ “ or whether Clinton can turn back around her historical disadvantages and fight back .
â€œThis is a world in pure chaos and she was in the lead seat as secretary of state , â€ � the Florida Republican adviser Rick Wilson told the Guardian on Monday , citing what he called a â€œresetâ€ � with Russia and an imperfect American response to the Arab spring .
The line was echoed hours later by Rubio , in a Miami speech rolling out his candidacy : â€œWhen America fails to lead , global chaos inevitably follows.â€ � Beyond Republican scare lines , Wilson noted â€œsome lingering radiation with a lot of Democratic base votersâ€ � over Clintonâ€ ™ s 2002 vote for the Iraq war .
Bush has not officially declared his candidacy but has already pushed anti - Clinton supporters to be â€œcommitted to stopping herâ€ � .
The former Florida governor , who has sought to distance himself from his brotherâ€ ™ s foreign policy and â€œdo it on my ownâ€ � even as he re - hires members of the team that pushed to invade Iraq , released a video ahead of Clintonâ€ ™ s announcement on Sunday that went directly after her record .
â€œWe must do better than the Obama - Clinton foreign policy that has damaged relationships with our allies and emboldened our enemies , â€ � Bush said ,
â€œbetter than their their failed , big government policiesâ€ � on the economy .
On the domestic front , where Clinton offered hints in her own video that â€œthe deck is still stacked in favor of those at the topâ€ � , former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum released a statement suggesting the former first lady was out of touch : â€œI believe we need a president who puts the American worker first , not the corporate interests the Clintons have aligned with.â€ �
Indeed , Republican operatives and a growing number of opposition researchers are busy dredging up nearly a quarter - century of animosity toward the Clinton family â€ “ not just from the conservative base but what they see as a wide swath of voters .
According to a recent Bloomberg poll , 29 % of respondents had â€œvery unfavorableâ€ � feelings toward the former secretary of state â€ “ higher than any other political figure polled , including George W Bush and Congress as a whole .
As Wilson noted , Clinton has been in the public eye for so long that â€œthereâ€ ™ s no novelty about Hillary , no newnessâ€
� .
The result , he said , is that even among those not inclined to dislike her , a certain sense of â€œClinton fatigueâ€ � has set in .
Those tired of her decades in the public eye â€ “ on both sides of the aisle â€ “ can make for veiled or outright jabs at Clintonâ€ ™ s age and experience .
The Stop Hillary Pac , an organization funded almost entirely by small donors and devoted solely to riling up opposition to the former secretary of state , is poised to peel away at the entirety of Clintonâ€ ™ s â€œscandal - ridden careerâ€ � , spokesman Matthew Chisholm said .
â€œFrom her early days as an attorney to Clinton
Foundationâ€
™ s shady fundraising and â€˜servergateâ€ ™ , thereâ€
™ s no shortage of Clinton improprieties , â€ � he told the Guardian .
Clinton controversy spans back to Whitewater , the much - scrutinized Arkansas land investment in which Bill and Hillary Clinton lost $ 300,000 .
The deal and its link to a failed savings - and - loan business prompted years of investigations by independent prosecutors that culminated in the revelation of Clintonâ€ ™ s affair with Monica Lewinsky .
The Clintons were never linked to criminal wrongdoing related to the land deal , but several others connected to the transaction were prosecuted and convicted .
Wilson , who worked on Rudy Giulianiâ€ ™ s stillborn US Senate campaign in 2000 , dismissed much of what happened in Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s past as â€œnot all that compellingâ€ � .
He argued that while the former secretary of state â€œplayed a central role in cleaning upâ€ � her husbandâ€ ™ s
â€œmulti - decade infidelitiesâ€ � along with unexplored details of Whitewater and her investments in cattle futures in the 1980s , the media was â€œgoing to ignoreâ€ � it as old news .
But Republicans still see opportunities in drawing attention back to more recent â€ “ if slightly less scandalous â€ “ Clinton controversies .
The Republican National Committee has been sending out flash drives filled with opposition research to draw attention to the controversy around what it calls Clintonâ€ ™ s
â€œhomebrew email serverâ€ � .
The same Bloomberg poll , from before Clintonâ€ ™ s announcement , showed a majority of Americans believe Clinton has not been truthful about turning over emails from her tenure at the State Department .
It remains to be seen whether this distrust of the former secretary of state will continue once the campaign begins in earnest .
Clinton will hold her first event as a presidential candidate on Tuesday in Monticello , Iowa ."
2015-04-15,"Ted Cruz supports a constitutional amendment to allow states to avoid recognizing same sex marriage .
Marco Rubio has supported one to gut Obamacare .
But now Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s jumped on the constitutional amendment bandwagon , only she has a good idea : a proposal that should appeal to the 80 % of Americans who support limits on political donations to candidates .
At a roundtable on Tuesday in Monticello , Iowa , Clinton suggested that action was needed to reverse Citizens United and the other Supreme Court decisions that allow corporations , wealthy individuals and well - funded groups to dominate the political process .
Clinton said : â€œWe need to fix the dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all , even if that takes a constitutional amendment.â€ � As a tactic , a constitutional amendment to authorize greater regulation of campaign finance is probably doomed to fail .
But the call for a constitutional amendment may finally build political support for more viable responses to a situation that the majority of Americans think is a problem .
( It could also help Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign . )
Jennifer Jacobs already reported in the Des Moines Register that Republicans have declared Clinton a hypocrite because she plans to raise plenty of money : â€œRepublicans noted that as Clinton spoke , big Democratic donors , including Clinton allies , were convening in California to talk this week about spending millions of dollars on liberal groupsâ€ � .
But thatâ€ ™ s not just self - interested , itâ€ ™ s stupid .
Wanting to change the rules doesnâ€
™ t mean that Clinton is obligated to unilaterally disarm in the meantime .
Thereâ€ ™ s no contradiction in wanting to restrict the role of money in political campaigns while raising money under the existing rules â€ “ and the fact that Clinton is doing the very fundraising that is necessary to seek the presidency in 2016
doesnâ€ ™ t mean she isnâ€
™ t allowed to argue for changing the system .
Thereâ€ ™ s also nothing wrong in principle with initiating greater restrictions on campaign spending and donations .
Most other liberal democracies have had more restrictive campaign finance regimes without instituting widespread regimes of censorship â€ “ and nearly 60 % of Americans donâ€
™ t believe that donation caps violate our right to free speech .
The court - initiated elimination of campaign finance restrictions has allowed wealthy interests to increase their stranglehold on the legislative process , drowning out the voices of ordinary people .
Yet , Clintonâ€ ™ s amendment proposal would be almost impossible to execute in practice .
Under Article V , the most common pathway to an amendment requires two - thirds of both houses of Congress and three quarters of state legislatures .
The Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights was ratified .
In other words , an amendment would require a large degree of bipartisan consensus .
Given the increasing ideological hostility to campaign finance reform among Republicans , as well as the benefits many incumbents of both parties gain from the current system , getting this degree of consensus would be near to impossible .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t mean that Clintonâ€ ™ s call for an amendment is a bad idea .
Progressives need to mobilize on behalf of campaign finance reform and draw attention to the egregious pro - corporate tilt of the Supreme Court , and advocating for an amendment is one way to do so .
Even while Citizens United and other decisions restricting campaign finance remain in place , progressives should be focusing on the other avenues it leaves open as well .
The Supreme Court has not held that disclosure requirements are unconstitutional , so the proposed Disclose Act â€ “ which was filibustered to death in 2010 â€ “ should be a major priority for the next Democratic Congress .
If the wealthy want to spend money to try to buy politicians , they should at least have to do so openly .
A public finance system robust enough to counteract the new flood of money would be a heavier lift but is worth fighting for .
There is , of course , another way to get rid of Citizens United : have Justice Scalia and/or Kennedy be replaced by a Democratic president .
By the time the next president is inaugurated , those two justices as well as Justice Ginsburg will have celebrated their 80th birthdays .
In itself , this is a powerful rationale for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s candidacy ."
2015-04-16,"Ted Cruz is raising money for his presidential campaign at a significantly faster rate than Mitt Romney did four years ago , eclipsing the early total raised by the former Massachusetts governor who went on to win the Republican nomination in 2012 .
The conservative Texas senator , who is seeking to unite the Republicansâ€ ™
Tea Party wing behind his White House run , raised $ 4.3 m during the final days of March â€ “ his first full week after declaring as a candidate for president .
Cruz proved particularly popular with small donors , raising more in his first week from contributors giving $ 200 or less than Romney did in the first 11 weeks of his campaign .
But the rightwing senator also raked in some noteworthy donations from two wealthy Republican donors â€ “ a sports owner and a private - equity investor â€ “ who are likely to be kingmakers in the forthcoming race for Super Pac money .
Cruz benefited from becoming the first Republican to formally enter the race for the 2016 nomination , an early move which also made him the only candidate required to submit details of first - quarter fundraising to the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) .
A detailed analysis of Cruzâ€ ™ s filing by the Guardian and the Center for Responsive Politics reveals that his opening money tally significantly outstripped Romneyâ€ ™ s performance in the eight days after he formed an exploratory committee four years ago .
The analysis of Cruzâ€ ™ s filing , which details donations made between between his declaration on 23 March and the first FEC deadline on 31 March , suggests the crowded Republican presidential primary is on course to be both expensive and hard - fought .
Cruz is considered a second - tier candidate , but is proving he can gain financial traction through the combination of a small - contributor support and backing from key billionaires .
Romneyâ€ ™ s presidential declaration , in mid - April 2011 , marked the first day he started raising money for his second presidential run .
Cruz did not announce the formation of an exploratory committee , choosing instead to start raising funds on the day he announced he would be seeking the Republican nomination .
Of the total Cruz raised in his first eight days , $ 2.2 m was elicited from large donors â€ “ those giving between $ 200 and $ 5,400 .
By comparison Romney , an establishment candidate who was popular among wealthy business donors , amassed only $ 725,000 from large donors in his first eight days fundraising for his 2012 campaign .
Cruz also appears to have raised significantly more from small donors , suggesting the conservative senator has early grassroots appeal .
Romneyâ€ ™ s total take from small donors over the first 11 weeks was just $ 1.1 m .
Cruz easily outstripped that tally in just over a week , raising $ 1.8 m in his first eight days .
Even when Romneyâ€ ™ s initial haul is measured from the point at which he officially declared he was running for president â€ “ 2 June 2011
â€ “ he still raised only $ 1.38 m , around a third of the total Cruz has generated from donations in the same eight - day period .
However , Cruzâ€ ™ s comparatively large opening tally may be less an indication of his early success as a candidate than a sign of what is likely to be a highly competitive , well - funded Republican primary race for all the major candidates .
The Republican primary contest four years ago was long and drawn out , but actually turned out to be a relatively inexpensive race .
Romney amassed the bulk of his war chest â€ “ which , like that of Barack Obama , amounted to more than $ 1bn â€ “ during the general election , once sums raised by Super Pacs were included in FEC filings .
Both senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio declared their White House bids after the 1 April deadline for first - quarter submissions to the FEC .
Their campaigns did leak what , if accurate , would be significant first - day fundraising totals that also signify the Republican nomination contest is on course to be hugely expensive .
Paul claimed to have raised in excess $ 1 m within 24 hours of his campaign launch in his home state , Kentucky , through his website alone .
However , the rate of fundraising from Paul , who is competing from a similar donor - base to Cruz , appears to have slowed considerably since then .
Nine days after his campaign launch , Paul has raised $ 2.2 m , roughly half the total amassed by Cruz , though that figure can not be verified as Paul has filed no official reports with the FEC .
Rubio , who announced his presidential campaign in his home state of Florida on Monday , reportedly raised $ 1.25 m online during his first full day as a candidate alone .
Everythingâ€ ™ s bigger in Texas â€ “ but what about New York ?
Despite his apparently impressive fundraising totals , Cruzâ€ ™ s reported fundraising skews to a local base of support , and suggests his campaign has not yet become a broad , national effort .
Of the $ 2.2 m from large donors , a full two - thirds came from individuals in Cruzâ€ ™ s home state of Texas .
Just $ 62,000 came from donors in New York City , where many GOP candidates have historically had success tapping the deep pockets of Wall Street executives and hedge - fund managers .
Even within Texas , the donations are relatively tightly focused , with more than half a million coming from Houston , where Cruz lived and worked before coming to Washington as a senator in 2012 .
But Cruz did attract some mega - donors who are considered have giant figures in conservative fundraising circles since the US supreme courtâ€ ™ s 2010 Citizens United decision , which allowed unlimited donations to Super Pacs .
They include Robert McNair , owner of the NFLâ€ ™ s Houston Texans franchise , who along with several members of his family made the maximum donation to Cruzâ€ ™ s primary campaign .
In each of the past two election cycles , McNair has given more than $ 3 m to conservative Super Pacs , including $ 2 m to the Super Pac that backed Romney in 2012 .
Another name lit in neon in the Republican fundraising world that showed up with a maximum donation for Cruz is John W Childs , a billionaire private - equity investor .
He has given millions to conservative Super Pacs , including $ 700,000 to Freedom Partners Action Fund , which is linked to billonaire star donors the Koch brothers .
Childs also gave $ 1 m to Romneyâ€ ™ s Super Pac in 2012 , as well as $ 1.7 m to Karl Roveâ€ ™ s American Crossroads .

2015-04-23,"After a record delay filled by stark partisan warfare and charges of racism , Loretta Lynch was confirmed on Thursday as the next US attorney general in a narrow Senate vote .
Lynchâ€ ™ s nomination passed 56 - 43 , with 10 Republicans crossing party lines to support her .
Senator Ted Cruz , a Texas Republican , missed the vote after making a speech against Lynch on the Senate floor on Thursday morning .
Lynch , the US attorney for the eastern district of New York , was nominated by Barack Obama last November to replace Eric Holder , who was the first African American attorney general in US history .
Lynch will be the first African American woman to hold the office .
â€œToday , the Senate finally confirmed Loretta Lynch to be Americaâ€ ™ s next attorney general â€ “ and America will be better off for it , â€ � Obama said in a statement after the Senate vote .
Holder said he was â€œpleasedâ€ � and congratulated Lynch in a statement released after the vote .
â€œI have known and worked closely with Loretta for many years , and I know that she will continue the vital work that this Administration has set in motion and leave her own innovative mark on the department in which we have both been privileged to serve , â€ � Holder said in the statement .
The presumptive next Democratic minority leader , Chuck Schumer , called Lynch â€œsomeone who has excelled at every stage of her education and careerâ€ � .
â€œIf thereâ€
™ s an American dream story
, Loretta Lynch is it , â€ � Schumer said , adding that Lynch would be especially effective at navigating tricky police brutality cases .
â€œIn some of the most difficult cases , cases with police on one side and the community on the other
, she emerged with fair decisions that made both sides praise her , â€ � Schumer said .
But the congratulations could not obscure the months of partisan acrimony that preceded them , which began in earnest after Lynchâ€ ™ s confirmation hearing in January before the judiciary committee .
The Democratic Senate minority leader , Harry Reid , said before the vote : â€œWhile Iâ€ ™ m pleased that Ms Lynch will be confirmed as attorney general , her nomination process is proof of all that is wrong with Republican leadership .
Senate Republicans made Loretta Lynchâ€ ™ s nomination linger more than 10 times longer than the average attorney just to spite the president.â€ � â€œI am sad .
I am depressed , â€ � said Claire McCaskill , a Democrat from Missouri , on the Senate floor before the vote .
â€œBecause what we are about to see is base , ugly politics at its worst .
Doesnâ€ ™ t get any uglier than this .
Because what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying is : you can take one of the most qualified attorney general nominees in history
â€ “ doesnâ€ ™ t make any difference .
We have a new test .
You must disagree with the president who nominated you.â€ �
At her confirmation hearing , Lynch was asked by Cruz â€ “ now
a Republican presidential candidate â€ “ whether she agreed with analysis by the White House office of the legal counsel supporting the presidentâ€ ™ s actions to defer deportation for millions of undocumented migrants .
â€œI did find the analysis to be reasonable , â€ �
she said .
Cruz and other Republicans seized on the comment to paint Lynch as a partisan actor instead of an impartial proponent of the law â€ “ an assessment countered by decades of cases in which Lynch , as a federal prosecutor , repeatedly took on and defeated some of the countryâ€ ™ s most insidious criminal networks .
As US attorney , she broke up human trafficking rings , investigated government corruption , sent accused al - Qaida conspirators to prison and dismantled the mafia in the local region .
Owing to the strength of her prosecutorial record , which her opponents never contested , and to her reputation as a team player beloved and respected by colleagues , the Republicansâ€ ™ months - long refusal to schedule a vote on Lynch began to strike some Democrats as motivated by something deeper than run - of - the - mill partisanship .
The last straw for Dick Durbin , the minority whip , came when the majority leader , Mitch McConnell , announced in mid - March that the Lynch vote would have to wait until the Senate resolved a squabble over abortion language in a human trafficking bill .
The legislation had no logical bearing on the Lynch nomination , except insofar as she was reputed to be one of the countryâ€ ™ s most stalwart defenders of victims of sex trafficking .
Durbin took the Senate floor and compared Lynch to Rosa Parks , the African American woman whose refusal to give up a bus seat to a white passenger in 1955 helped set off the civil rights movement .
â€œAnd so , Loretta Lynch , the first African American woman nominated to be attorney general , is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar , â€ �
Durbin said .
â€œThat is unfair .
Itâ€ ™ s unjust .
It is beneath the decorum and dignity of the United States Senate .
This woman deserves fairness.â€
�
The cry of injustice failed to move the nomination forward until Tuesday , when senators announced they had reached a compromise on the abortion spat .
â€œIt certainly
shouldnâ€ ™ t have taken this long , â€ � said Patty Murray , the Democratic senator who brokered the deal .
â€œWhat Iâ€ ™ m worried about is that the Senate is making history for the wrong reasons , â€ � said Senator Patrick Leahy on Thursday .
Lynch has at least 21 months , the time remaining in Obamaâ€ ™ s presidency , to make her mark as attorney general .
She could serve longer , if Obama is succeeded by a Democrat .
Lynch was nominated 167 days ago .
The longest previous confirmation wait for any modern attorney general was 30 days for Alberto Gonzales , a George W Bush nominee , in 2005 ."
2015-04-24,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz last night insisted he was not softening his stance on same - sex marriage following reports of comments he made at an event hosted by two gay businessmen .
During the dinner , an intimate â€œfireside chatâ€ � at the Manhattan apartment of hoteliers Mati Weiderpass and Ian Reisner earlier this week , Cruz said if one of his daughters was gay , he would still love her â€œwith all our heartsâ€ � , the New York Times reported on Thursday .
The comments were interpreted as a shift in tone for Cruz , an ardent opponent of gay marriage who is targeting the evangelical vote as he seeks to become the Republicansâ€ ™ candidate for president .
In response , Cruz issued a statement accusing the media of trying to paint a caricature of conservatives and reaffirmed his opposition to same - sex marriage .
Cruz said he was asked about gay marriage at the event , to which he responded with his belief in â€œtraditional marriageâ€ � .
â€œOne
person further asked how Heidi and I would react if we found out one of our ( 4- and 7-year - old ) daughters were gay .
My reply : â€˜We would love her with all our hearts .
We love our daughters unconditionally , â€ ™ â€ � Cruz said .
â€œA conservative Republican who is willing to meet with individuals who do not agree on marriage and who loves his daughters unconditionally may not reflect the caricature of conservatives promoted by the left , but itâ€ ™ s hardly newsworthy.â€ �
Cruz introduced a constitutional amendment this week that would define marriage as between a man and a woman â€ “ as the supreme court prepares to hear legal arguments next week on whether gay marriage is a constitutional right .
Cruz , a Tea Party favorite who has built a grassroots following for taking a hard - right line against establishment Republicans , has also been a vocal supporter of so - called â€œreligious freedomâ€ � laws that have been accused of opening the door to discrimination against LGBT people .
Other GOP presidential hopefuls have tried to walk a finer line on the issue , faced with a general electorate in which the majority has embraced gay marriage .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and Ohio governor John Kasich have all positioned themselves as accepting of gay couples when faced with questions ahead of the supreme court case .
Rubio said last week he would attend a same - sex wedding and went on to say that being gay was not a choice , although he maintained his opposition to gay marriage .
Walker said he had been to a gay wedding , while Kasich said he planned to attend one soon .
Cruz has claimed questions on the subject are part of the liberal mediaâ€ ™ s agenda to paint Republicans as extreme on social issues .
Conservative host Hugh Hewitt asked both Cruz and former presidential candidate Rick Santorum if they would attend a gay wedding .
Rubio has disputed this idea .
On CNN earlier this month , host Jake Tapper asked the Florida senator if the media was playing a â€œgotchaâ€ � game with the GOP over such issues .
â€œNo , no , these are important issues , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œPeople want to know what you feel and think about them .
I think theyâ€ ™ re very important issues to a lot of people in this country .
And I recognize that weâ€ ™ re a country that has people on both sides of these issues that feel very strongly about it .
I owe people where I stand â€
“
I will tell you where I stand.â€

Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal joined the debate this week , penning an article attacking gay marriage in the New York Times .
â€œPolls indicate that the American consensus is changing â€ “ but like many other believers , I will not change my faith - driven view on this matter , even if it becomes a minority opinion , â€ � he wrote ."
2015-04-25,"The best comedian on the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday morning was Texas senator Ted Cruz .
The first - term senator who was the first Republican to declare his campaign for the presidency in 2016 received a warm reception from nearly 800 attendees at the spring meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition ( RJC ) at the Venetian Hotel .
He gave a speech packed with jokes , one - liners and even a Jay Leno impersonation as he sought to sell a rather establishment audience on his viability as a candidate .
The Texas senator emphasized his steadfastness on key issues .
â€œIt isnâ€ ™ t complicated to come to the RJC and say you stand with Israel , â€ � he said .
â€œUnless youâ€ ™ re a blithering idiot , thatâ€ ™ s what you say when you come to the RJC.â€
�
He then tried to differentiate himself from the competition by talking about his personal ties with Israel and his record in the Senate .
Cruz has long been known in Washington as a partisan firebrand , but he boasted about his bipartisan record on pro - Israel legislation .
He mentioned his work with a New York Democrat , Kirsten Gillibrand , and praised the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg , a figure despised by many conservatives for his support of gun control , for pointedly flying to Israel in 2014 , when the FAA briefly put a restriction on US airlines doing so after a Hamas rocket landed near Ben Gurion airport .
Cruz also said he would do â€œeverything humanly possibleâ€ � to stop the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s deal with Iran over its nuclear ambitions .
Yet he spent far more time highlighting his fundraising prowess and the success of his campaign so far .
Cruz noted , for example , that the super PAC supporting him raised $ 31 m in one week .
As he told attendees , that is â€œmore money than any other super PAC has raised in the opening week [ of a campaign ] in the history of politicsâ€ � .
He added that he was attracting crowds on visits to early primary states that were â€œstanding room onlyâ€ � .
In Cruzâ€ ™ s telling , his crowds were â€œlarger than those for any other candidate and double of the size of most of the other candidatesâ€ ™ . â€œThereâ€ ™ s going to be no candidate who works harder than me over the next two years , â€ �
Cruz said before pledging that both and he and his wife , Heidi , would â€œwork 16 hours a day , six days a weekâ€ � to win election to the White House in 2016 .
The Texas senator also tried to rebut concerns that his experience as a first - term senator made him little different from Barack Obama when he ran for the presidency in 2008 .
He proclaimed â€ “ to a loud and standing ovation â€ “ that Obama was â€œnot a lousy president because he was a senator .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a lousy president because he is a radical ideologue and a zealot and the ideas he believes have been profoundly dangerous to the United States and to the world.â€ �
While the audience seemed to inclined to back more establishment candidates such as Jeb Bush , Scott Walker and Marco Rubio , Cruz was clearly trying to establish himself as a viable contender and woo attendees who might be more skeptical about his electability than his ideology .
Among this discerning crowd of donors , partisan red meat and jokes are nice .
But winning is far more important ."

2015-04-26,"A day after the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said conservatives should â€œfall to our knees and prayâ€ � that the supreme court will not make same - sex marriage legal in all 50 states , comments from two attorneys who argued landmark cases on the subject suggested that prayer is indeed the last resort of those who remain opposed .
On Tuesday , the court will begin hearing oral arguments in same - sex marriage cases brought from four states .
The case is expected to settle the legality of same - sex marriage in the US for good by June .
Cruz , speaking at the Iowa Faith and Freedom gathering in Des Moines on Saturday , also said : â€œWe need leaders who will stand unapologetically in defense of marriage and life.â€ � Attorneys Ted Olson and David Boies suggested that such leaders would not be found â€ “ in sufficient numbers â€ “ among the nine supreme court justices .
Olson and Boies successfully argued against Californiaâ€ ™ s same - sex marriage ban , Proposition 8 , and the federal Defense of Marriage Act ( Doma ) , whose downfall in the supreme court in June 2013 precipitated the current situation in which same - sex marriage is legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia .
Eleven states and Washington DC have made same - sex marriage legal ; 25 states have been forced to allow it by judicial decisions following that of the supreme court .
On Sunday , Olson and Boies appeared on NBC .
Asked if the supreme court could yet hand opponents of same - sex marriage a lifeline by deciding that it was an issue for individual states to decide , Olson said : â€œWhat the supreme court said in the Defense of Marriage case , which was called the Windsor case , was that laws like the federal statute that restricted the rights of individuals who wished to get married to a person of the same sex were demeaning , disrespected their relationship , took away their constitutional rights .
â€œIf you read what the supreme court said in that case , thereâ€ ™ s really no other way for the supreme court to come out in the case thatâ€ ™ s up for argument on Tuesday.â€
�
Olson predicted that the same five supreme court justices who voted to strike down Doma by a 5 - 4 majority â€ “ Anthony Kennedy , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan
â€ “ would now vote to make same - sex marriage legal in all states .
John Roberts , Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia voted against the striking down of Doma .
â€œWe were hoping that all nine justices would finally fall in line once the case was decided , â€ � Olson said , â€œbecause of the inherent rights of individuals .
So Iâ€ ™ m still optimistic that it will be more than five votes , but we can count the justices from the Defense of Marriage case and their explanations for why they decided that way.â€ � Boies conceded that it was â€œa little hard to figure outâ€ � how any of the four who opposed on Windsor would switch their opinions , but said : â€œI think civil rights cases ought to be decided 9 - 0 or 8 - 1 , the way racial and civil rights decisions were largely made .
â€œIt sends a message that this country doesnâ€ ™ t tolerate discrimination .
I think the more justices that sign on , the better.â€ � Asa Hutchinson , the Republican governor of Arkansas , also appeared on NBC .
He was asked if he thought the court could yet leave the issue to the states .
â€œI think there is a way the court can do that , â€ � he said .
â€œIf you look at the way the Windsor case was spoken of , it was not just how gays were treated that was part of the decision .
There was also a deference to statesâ€ ™ definition of marriage .
â€œWhat has changed ?
The constitution hasnâ€ ™ t changed but a lot has changed in the state courts .
A lot of states have moved towards recognising gay marriages have done it through judicial fiat , versus the legislative process .
So the courts are really forcing this issue .
â€œAs to what the supreme court could do
, I think
itâ€ ™ s really unpredictable .
They could continue to give some deference to the states .
But I do think that weâ€ ™ ll have to recognise what happens in another state.â€ � Hutchinson , who recently said he would veto a controversial â€œreligious freedomâ€ � bill in his state after being lobbied by his own son , said the contention over same - sex marriage was stoked by political , geographical and generational differences .
Despite the seemingly impending decision in favour of same - sex marriage , such differences continue to fire up the declared and undeclared contenders for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination .
Many among the 20 or so politicians seeking support in the race , including Florida senator Marco Rubio , have tried to walk a fine line by saying â€ “ on an issue in which majorities of Americans are now in favour â€ “ that they oppose gay marriage without opposing gay rights .
Others , such as Cruz and the former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum , have maintained a harder line ."
2015-04-27,"A prominent gay hotelier in New York City has apologized to the gay community for meeting the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz , who staunchly opposes same - sex marriage .
Ian Reisner said in a Facebook post on Sunday he was â€œshaken to the bonesâ€ � about the response to his meeting with Cruz and called it â€œa terrible mistakeâ€ � .
Reisner and his business partner , Mati Weiderpass , hosted the presidential candidate for an intimate â€œfireside chatâ€ � at their Manhattan apartment last week .
At the meeting , according to the New York Times , Cruz said he would still love his daughters if they came out as gay .
He also said that states should decided whether to legalize same - sex marriage , but the former comment inspired suggestions that Cruz , who is courting the evangelical vote , was softening his position on same - sex marriage .
This prompted Cruz to reaffirm his opposition .
The same week , he had introduced legislation to protect state bans on same - sex marriage .
The meeting with Reisner and Weiderpass drew fire from the gay community , with thousands supporting a boycott of the hoteliersâ€ ™ properties .
â€œI was ignorant , naive and much too quick in accepting a request to co - host a dinner with Cruz at my home without taking the time to completely understand all of his positions on gay rights , â€ � Reisner said .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve spent the past 24 hours reviewing videos of Cruzâ€ ™ s statements on gay marriage and I am shocked and angry.â€ � More than 8,800 people have liked a Facebook page calling for a boycott of businesses which include OUT NYC hotel and gay beach resort Fire Island Pines .
The theater industry nonprofit Broadway Cares / Equity Fights Aids canceled a benefit at the hotelâ€ ™ s 42West nightclub , in response to the interview .
The fundraiser was scheduled for 10 May , but the foundationâ€ ™ s executive director , Tom Viola , said he could not â€œin good conscience hold an event at a venue whose owners have alienated our communityâ€ � .
Last week , Cruz introduced two bills to restrict legal challenges to state bans on same - sex marriage , just as the supreme court prepares to hear oral arguments on Tuesday about whether same - sex couples have a constitutional right to marry .
It is expected that the court will rule in favor of marriage equality .
But Cruz is seeking a constitutional amendment that would protect states with laws that define marriage as between man and a woman .
His second piece of legislation would block federal courts from being able to rule on challenges to such bans until the first piece of legislation is enacted .
â€œI sincerely apologize for hurting the gay community and so many of our friends , family , allies , customers and employees , â€ � Reisner said .
â€œI will try my best to make up for my poor judgement .
Again , I am deeply sorry.â€ �"
2015-04-29,"Senator Ted Cruz has accused Barack Obama , the countryâ€ ™ s first African American president , of having â€œinflamed racial tensionsâ€ � during his time in the White House .
Cruz , a Texan who is running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination , made the comments in a speech at a US Hispanic chamber of commerce event in Washington DC .
The speech included other controversial assertions , including that the growth of national support for same - sex marriage was â€œheartbreakingâ€ � and that Democrats had tried to â€œscareâ€ � Hispanics into voting for them by talking about immigration .
Cruz said that Obama â€œcould have chosen to be a leaderâ€ � on race relations , but instead â€œhas made decisions that I think have inflamed racial tensions â€ “ that have divided us rather than bringing us togetherâ€ � .
Cruz also got in a dig at Vice - President Joe Biden , saying a comment Biden made during the 2012 presidential race had likewise detracted from racial comity .
Biden appeared in August 2012 before a largely African American crowd in Virginia and said Mitt Romney would be a bad choice for president .
â€œHe is going to let the big banks once again write their own rules , unchain Wall Street , â€ �
Biden said .
â€œHe is going to put yâ€ ™ all back in chains.â€ �
The Obama campaign declined to apologize for the comment .
Americans have become more focused on racial tensions during the Obama presidency , polls have found .
Following the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , in August 2014 , the proportion of Americans naming â€œrace relationsâ€ � or â€œracismâ€ � as the top problem facing the country spiked to 13 % in a Gallup poll , a 20-plus - year high .
Cruz placed blame for the phenomenon not on the seemingly constant high - profile cases in which unarmed black men have been killed by police officers since Eric Garner was killed in July 2014 , but on the president .
Obama has faced the criticism before .
Some supporters during his first presidential run said he was too slow to talk about race in light of incendiary comments by his former pastor , Jeremiah Wright .
The candidate subsequently made a well - received speech in Philadelphia on the topic , which included the line : â€œBut it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts â€ “ that out of many , we are truly one.â€ �
In 2009 Obama said a white police officer had â€œacted stupidlyâ€ � in arresting Henry Louis Gates Jr , the distinguished professor , on the porch of his own home .
He later held a â€œbeer summitâ€ � at the White House between Gates and the arresting officer , sergeant James Crowley .
Reflecting on the death of Trayvon Martin , the 17-year - old shot dead by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012 , Obama said : â€œYou know , if I had a son , heâ€ ™ d look like Trayvon.â€ �
On Tuesday , Obama said that â€œsince Fergusonâ€ �
the country had â€œseen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals , primarily African Americans , often poor , in ways that raise troubling questionsâ€ � ."
2015-05-04,"Carly Fiorina formally declared herself a candidate for president on Monday , making her the first woman to seek the Republican nomination in 2016 â€ “ and perhaps Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s most antagonistic foil .
She announced the move on Twitter with the simple message : â€œI am running for president.â€
�
Fiorina , a former chief executive of Hewlett - Packard , joins senators Ted Cruz , Rand Paul and Marco Rubio in what is shaping up to be a crowded GOP field .
The retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson announced his candidacy too ; former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is expected to launch his campaign on Tuesday .
Fiorina , 60 , has never held public office , having lost a 2010 Senate bid in California after serving as an adviser to John
McCainâ€ ™ s 2008 presidential campaign .
But she has touted her private sector experience as the first female CEO of a Fortune 20 company , despite a tumultuous few years as the head of Hewlett - Packard that ultimately led to her losing her job .
On her new website , she wrote a message that has been a staple of the run - up to a formal campaign launch : â€œOnly in the United States of America can a young woman start as a secretary and work to become chief executive of one of the largest technology companies in the world.â€ � Fiorina is viewed by many as the Republican partyâ€ ™ s best answer to Hillary Clinton , the frontrunner among Democrats .
Fiorina is already assuming the role of Clinton attack dog and in numerous public appearances has gone after the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s family non - profit , the Clinton Foundation , and its dealings with foreign governments .
Her campaign launch video opens with her watching Clintonâ€ ™ s much - publicised campaign launch film on TV , before ostentatiously switching it off with her remote control .
â€œOur founders never intended us to have a professional political class ,
â€ �
Fiorina says .
â€œThey believed that citizens and leaders needed to step forward .
We know the only way to reimagine our government is to reimagine who is leading it.â€
�
She adds : â€œIf youâ€ ™ re tired of the soundbites , the vitriol , the pettiness , the egos , the corruption , if you believe that itâ€ ™ s time to declare the end of identity politics , if you believe that itâ€ ™ s time to declare the end of lowered expectations , if you believe that itâ€ ™ s time for citizens to stand up to the political class and say : â€˜Enoughâ€ ™ , then join us.â€ �
In a call with reporters on Monday , she said her campaign was not just anti - Clinton , then proceeded to attack Clinton again .
â€œYes , I would be running for president no matter who the nominee is on the Democratic side ,
â€ �
she told the call .
â€œShe
[ Clinton ] reminds people that there is a huge disconnect between that political class and the hopes and concerns of the hardworking Americans everywhere.â€
�
In an interview with ABCâ€ ™ s Good Morning America on Monday
, she went further : â€œShe clearly is not trustworthy , about a whole set of things , â€ � Fiorina said of Clinton .
On Tuesday , Fiorina is scheduled to speak at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York before traveling to Iowa .
Her new book , Rising to the Challenge , is also set for release on Tuesday .
It details aspects of her personal life and how the death of her daughter and her fight against cancer intensified her adherence to Christianity .
She is also the author of Tough Choices , a memoir that focused on her business career .
Nearly a dozen Republicans are expected to make a bid for the White House , including former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum .
On the Democratic side , the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders joined Clinton as an official candidate last week .
Former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley and former Virginia senator Jim Webb are also expected to run ."
2015-05-06,"Despite their all too obvious differences , one surprising policy unites the Democratic and Republican candidates for president : almost all of them want to change the US constitution .
From Bernie Sanders on the left to Ted Cruz on the right , seven of the eight politicians who have declared they are running for the White House have also supported the passage of a constitutional amendment .
Many of the remaining 2016 contenders have proposed this extreme legal option too , along with half a dozen congressmen in recent days , Barack Obama , dozens of states and 600 city councils or county boards .
Of course , not all of them agree on what it is that needs fixing in the 227-year - old document , and fewer still believe it will happen anytime soon , but the upsurge in talk suggests constitutional reform may no longer be the refuge of political kooks .
Some Democrats , such as senator Sanders and Hillary Clinton , have voiced support in recent days for an amendment as a last resort to reduce the power of money in political life , reversing a supreme court decision that removed campaign finance limits .
This weekâ€ ™ s new entrants to the 2016 race , Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson , back a long - standing Republican campaign for a balanced budget amendment that would stop Congress racking up the national debt .
Rand Paul wants to change the constitution to limit how long lawmakers can serve in office , while Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have respectively supported amendments to challenge Obamacare and gay marriage .
The current appetite for changing the constitution â€ “ a document usually revered as an immutable feature of American political life
â€ “ is doubly surprising given how futile most attempts at amending it typically prove .
â€œIt is very difficult in practice to change the constitution , â€ � observes Georgetown University law professor Louis Michael Seidman .
â€œIt is , by most peoplesâ€ ™ judgement , the hardest constitution in the world to amend .
So none of these amendments is likely to be enacted.â€ �
Since it was signed in 1787 , the US constitution has been successfully changed only 27 times , and all but two of these attempts took place more than 50 years ago .
Even the last successfully completed amendment in 1992 , limiting the ability of lawmakers to set their own salaries , took over two centuries to ratify .
The standard route requires the agreement of not just two - thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , but three - quarters of the state legislatures too â€ “ an all but impossible mountain to climb in these times of national political gridlock .
Unsurprisingly , attempts have dwindled since the heady days of the late 18th century when the first 10 amendments famously enshrined rights such as free speech and the right to bear arms .
Figures compiled by the US Senate show the number of proposals tailing off particularly as Congress has become riven by ever sharper partisan divides â€ “ halving from over 150 attempts per two - year term in the 1990s to less than double figures over the last decade and a half .
But constitutional experts say an increase in activity could coincide with the influential campaign for a balanced budget , which claims to be within seven states of the two - thirds majority of state legislatures needed to trigger an alternative method for seeking amendments .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a little complicated how you count it , but we are getting quite close the numbers requiring a constitutional convention , â€ � says Seidman .
â€œThis would be a very dramatic event because itâ€ ™ s not at all clear that the subjects the convention would take up can be limited in advance , so conceivably the convention could â€ “ as in 1789
â€ “ decide to just scrap the constitution and write an entirely new one.â€ �
Few predict anything that dramatic will happen .
Triggering a convention is still an enormous long - shot and one that could be easily blocked by challenges in the supreme court , yet its possibility highlights the extent of legal uncertainties .
â€œNobody has really thought hard about any of these issues â€ “ it hasnâ€ ™ t come up since 1789 â€ “
and nobody is paying much attention to it right now , â€ � adds Seidman .
â€œBut thatâ€ ™ s a possibility that would shake a lot of things loose .
Itâ€ ™ s possible
such a convention would consider things like campaign finance.â€ � That would certainly please the other grassroots movements pushing hard for an amendment that sees the dominance of corporate money in politics as just the sort of issues the founders expected to see tackled .
One such group is called Move to Amend .
It seeks to reform campaign finance by removing the protected status of corporations which it says lies at the heart of the 2010 supreme court ruling that political campaign spending is a form of free speech protected by the first amendment .
â€œThis movement began with 12 people in a living room , today we are 386,000 people and growing every day , â€ � says spokesman David Cobb .
â€œSix hundred communities have passed resolutions of support , 16 states on record and over 300 communities have voted on this issue and we have won every single one of them.â€ �
Though such local ballot initiatives carry little to no weight , Cobb views them as a â€œmovement building processâ€ � and appears to have been proved right by the recent introduction a similar bill backed by six progressive Democrats in the House of Representatives .
â€œItâ€ ™ s time to establish once and for all that corporations are not people
, money is not free speech , and our elections and public policy - making process are not for sale to the highest corporate bidders , â€ � says one sponsor , Rick Nolan .
â€œItâ€ ™ s time to take the molding and shaping of public policy out of corporate boardrooms , away from corporate lobbyists , and give it back to the American people.â€ �
Once dismissed as wildly idealistic , such views are increasingly mainstream among Democrats and some Republicans too .
Senator Sanders , who joined the presidential race last week , has authored legislation that seeks to â€œlimit the corrosive influence of money in our democratic processâ€ � .
Clinton , a former secretary of state and senator , has said she also wishes to â€œfix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all , even if it takes a constitutional amendmentâ€ � .
Even Obama has said he â€œwould love to see some constitutional process that would allow us to actually regulate campaign spending the way we used to , and maybe even improve itâ€ � .
They also have history on their side when it comes to arguing that the constitution is the appropriate vehicle to tackle conflicts of interest within the branches of government â€ “ even if the mountain has never looked harder to climb .
â€œThe majority of [ successful ] amendments were intended to expand the franchise and to give more people access to the political process â€ “ prohibiting denying the vote on the basis of race , on the basis of gender , of age , â€ � says professor Seidman .
â€œA very large number of them have been pro - democracy , but they were also enacted in a period where there wasnâ€ ™ t the gridlock there is now so there is no reason to be optimistic about any of these amendments passing.â€ �"
2015-05-16,"â€œWe are a bunch of babies , â€ �
Donald Trump warned a church full of conservative activists in Iowa on Saturday , as Republican presidential hopefuls stepped up their deployment of fear over national security as the weapon of choice to differentiate themselves in a crowded campaign .
â€œWe are led by stupid people and we canâ€ ™ t go on like this , â€ � added Trump , whose focus , like that of Bobby Jindal , Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum , was what they see as the threat posed by Islam : both from jihadists living within America and in the shape of Iran and the Islamic State .
â€œChristians canâ€ ™ t come into this country but Muslims can , â€ � said Trump .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s that all about ?
Something has got to be coming down from the top .
People are flowing through [ the southern border ] like water .
At what point is it going to be too late?â€
�
Santorum was also blunt about why he was addressing the small and mostly elderly crowd at the National Security Action Summit in Des Moines .
â€œYou have an opportunity to play a huge rule in deciding who is our next commander - in - chief , â€ � said the former Pennsylvania senator , who has not yet declared a second run for the White House .
â€œYou are leaders because you are Iowans
â€
¦ you are first out of the box .
There are an enormous number of people who are going to be vying for your attention.â€ �
But just in case the stateâ€ ™ s early role in voting for the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee
wasnâ€ ™ t enough to hold the crowdâ€ ™ s attention , Santorum brought his fears about Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme vividly to life .
â€œAn electromagnetic pulse over the state of Iowa could knock us back to the stone age , â€ � he warned .
â€œWorse , [ at least ] people in the stone age knew how to live in the stone age .
We donâ€ ™ t.â€ �
Asked by a concerned member of the audience how to tell the difference between peaceful Muslims and radical jihadists , Santorum answered : â€œIf you look at Islamists , they all have the same ideology .
By and large the only difference between the Muslim Brotherhood and Isis is the methods they will take to impose their theology.â€ �
Jindal , the governor of Louisiana , rejected accusations that a growing focus on Islamic extremism , particularly since an attempted attack in Garland , Texas this month , represented dangerous stereotyping of the religion as a whole .
â€œI came to speak about this in London this past January and when you say things like that you had better be ready , â€ � he said .
â€œThe politically correct crowd are going to tell you you are anti - Muslim or racist or you have an outdated mindset and Iâ€ ™
m telling you thatâ€ ™ s ridiculous .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t beat this enemy unless we recognise this enemy for what is .
â€œ Frank Gaffney , a controversial Washington figure who as president of the Center for Security Policy helped organise the conference , pulled fewer punches .
â€œ[Muslim ] doctors , civil engineers , and scientists have a capacity to prove very problematic if they embrace this jihadist doctrine of Sharia , â€ � he warned , in a lengthy speech on how the US was being infiltrated by â€œcivilisational jihadâ€ � .
Gaffney even accused Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s adviser Huma Abedin of having â€œextensive personal and family ties to the Muslim
Brotherhoodâ€ � .
Above all , it was Clinton and President Barack Obama who posed the biggest threat , the speakers agreed .
â€œ[Obama ] appeases our enemies and uses funny language to describe them , â€ � said Santorum .
Repeating a line from an appearance at a similar â€œsummitâ€ � in South Carolina last weekend , he added : â€œWe have a president that has abandoned ship on realism .
Let me give him a little primer .
Iran : enemy .
Israel : friend.â€ � â€œIt is a dark and dangerous world , â€ � said Ted Cruz , who spoke via video link .
â€œAnd it has got much more dangerous over the last six years.â€ � â€œIt is not optional for us to win this next election , â€ � concluded Jindal .
â€œWe must beat Hillary Clinton , not for the sake of the Republican party , not even for the sake of the conservative movement , but for the sake of the greatest country in the history of the world : the United States of America.â€ �"
2015-06-22,"Four presidential hopefuls are among 23 Republicans who have given up more than $ 36,000 in campaign contributions from the leader of a white nationalist group said to have influenced the Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof .
Scott Walker , Rand Paul , Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum led a GOP group spanning Congress and statehouses who said they would donate to charity or return money from Earl Holt , following the publication of a Guardian article on Sunday .
Many other Republicans who took money from Holt declined to comment on the contributions .
Josh Mandel , Ohioâ€ ™ s state treasurer , said he would not return $ 1,500
Holt gave to his failed 2012 US Senate campaign , as it had been spent .
Mandelâ€ ™ s campaign still has almost $ 50,000 in the bank .
Holt , the president of the Council of Conservative Citizens ( CofCC ) , has contributed more than $ 74,000 to Republican candidates and committees in recent years , according to public filings , while making dozens of racist statements online .
His organisation , which is labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center , was cited by the author of an extremist manifesto posted on a website registered in Roofâ€ ™ s name and hosting photographs of the 21-year - old .
Walker , the Wisconsin governor , will pass the $ 3,500 Holt gave his state campaigns to a charity , AshLee Strong , a spokeswoman , said in an email .
Walker is expected to officially announce a campaign for president in the coming weeks .
His decision followed 2016 candidates Paul , a senator for Kentucky , Cruz , a senator for Texas , and Santorum , a former senator for Pennsylvania , passing a total of $ 14,250 they received from Holt to a memorial fund for Emanuel AME church in Charleston , South Carolina , where nine people were shot dead last week .
â€œI abhor the sentiments Mr Holt has expressed .
These statements and sentiments are unacceptable .
Period .
End of sentence , â€ �
Santorum said in a statement .
The manifesto author , widely reported but not verified as Roof , recounted learning about â€œbrutal black on white murdersâ€ � from the CfCC website .
â€œAt this moment
I realised that something was very wrong , â€ � the manifesto said .
Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder .
He is accused of joining a Bible study group at the church last Wednesday evening and opening fire , declaring that the attack was racially motivated before fleeing in his car .
Jared Taylor , a spokesman for the CoCC , said in a statement on Monday that its leaders â€œutterly condemnâ€ � Roofâ€ ™ s alleged killings , but said the shootings â€œdo not detract in the slightest from the legitimacy of some of the positions he has expressedâ€ � .
Taylor said : â€œIgnoring legitimate grievances is dangerous.â€ �
Another $ 12,000 in Holt campaign contributions are to be donated to the church fund from senators Joni Ernst of Iowa , Thom Tillis of North Carolina , Jeff Flake of Arizona , Rob Portman of Ohio , Dean Heller of Nevada , Ron Johnson of Wisconsin , and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana , along with representatives Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , Steve King of Iowa , Ryan Zinke of Montana , Louie Gohmert of Texas , Kenneth Buck of Colorado , and Mark Sanford of South Carolina .
Spokespeople for the Texas governor , Greg Abbott , and senators Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Jim Risch of Idaho , who received a combined $ 6,000 in campaign contributions from Holt , according to filings , said they would be giving the money to charity .
Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas , Representative Thomas Emmer of Minnesota and Representative Mia Love of Utah â€ “ the first black female Republican in Congress
â€ “ said they would be returning a total of $ 3,000 in contributions to Holt .
â€œI do not agree with his hateful beliefs and language and believe they are hurtful to our country , â€ �
Cotton said in a statement .
In a statement published on Sunday , Holt said it was â€œnot surprisingâ€ � that Roof was apparently informed by the groupâ€ ™ s website as it reported race relations â€œaccurately and honestlyâ€ � .
However , he added : â€œThe CofCC is hardly responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.â€

2015-06-22,"The leader of a rightwing group that Dylann Roof allegedly credits with helping to radicalise him against black people before the Charleston church massacre has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republicans such as presidential candidates Ted Cruz , Rand Paul and Rick Santorum .
Earl Holt has given $ 65,000 to Republican campaign funds in recent years while inflammatory remarks â€ “ including that black people were â€œthe laziest , stupidest and most criminally - inclined race in the history of the worldâ€ � â€ “ were posted online in his name .
After being approached by the Guardian on Sunday , Cruzâ€ ™ s presidential campaign said it would be returning all money the senator had received from Holt .
Holt , 62 , is the president of the Council of Conservative Citizens ( CofCC ) , a Missouri - based activist organisation cited by the author of a manifesto - style text that was posted on a website registered in Roofâ€ ™ s name along with photographs of the gunman .
The FBI said on Saturday it was investigating the website .
The manifestoâ€ ™ s author , who has been widely reported but not verified as Roof , recounted learning about â€œbrutal black on white murdersâ€ � from the CofCC website .
â€œAt this moment
I realised that something was very wrong , â€ � the manifesto said .
Roof , 21 , is charged with the murders of nine black people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston , South Carolina , last Wednesday .
He is accused of joining a bible study group before opening fire and fleeing .
In a statement published on Sunday , Holt said it was â€œnot surprisingâ€ � that Roof was apparently informed by the groupâ€ ™ s website as it reported race relations â€œaccurately and honestlyâ€ � .
However , he added : â€œThe CofCC is hardly responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.â€ � Reached by telephone at home on Sunday evening by the Guardian , Holt said he was busy and hung up .
Holt has since 2012 contributed $ 8,500 to Cruz , the Texas senator running for the Republican presidential nomination , and his Jobs , Growth and Freedom Fund political action committee , according to Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) filings .
On some filings Holtâ€ ™ s occupation was listed as â€œslumlordâ€ � .
He has also given $ 1,750 to RandPAC , the political action committee of Paul , the Kentucky senator and presidential contender , and he gave $ 2,000 to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney .
A further $ 1,500 was donated by Holt to Santorum , the former Pennsylvania senator and 2012 Republican presidential primary runner - up , who is running for president again in the 2016 race and attended Sundayâ€ ™ s memorial service at Emanuel AME Church .
In response to questions from the Guardian , Rick Tyler , a spokesman for Cruz , said in an email : â€œUpon review , we discovered that Mr Holt did make a contribution .
We will be immediately refunding the donation.â€ �
Tyler said Cruzâ€ ™ s own campaign and leadership Pac would â€œbe making a full refundâ€ � .
On Monday , however , a spokesman for Cruz said the senator had decided not to return the contributions to Holt after all and would instead be making an $ 11,000 donation to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund .
â€œUpon learning
Mr Holtâ€ ™ s background , Senator Cruz made an immediate decision to return his contributions , â€ � said the spokesman .
â€œHowever after reflection , he decided that the best use of that money would not be to return it but instead use it to help support the families of victims from the Charleston shooting.â€ �
On Monday morning Paulâ€ ™ s presidential campaign said he , too , would be forfeiting the money contributed by Holt .
â€œRandPAC is donating the funds to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund to assist the victimsâ€ ™ families , â€ � said Doug Stafford , his chief strategist .
On Sunday Matthew Beynon , a spokesman for Santorum , said in an email : â€œSenator Santorum does not condone or respect racist or hateful comments of any kind .
Period .
The views the Senator campaigns on are his own and he is focused on uniting America , not dividing her.â€ �
In a statement on Monday afternoon , Santorum said he , too , would be donating past campaign contributions to the fund for the victimsâ€ ™ families .
â€œI abhor the sentiments Mr Holt has expressed , â€ �
Santorum said .
â€œThese statements and sentiments are unacceptable.â€ �
A series of racist statements have been posted over the past four years to the website of The Blaze , a conservative news outlet , by a user going by Holtâ€ ™ s full name , Earl P Holt III .
The user referred to Longview , Texas â€ “ which is where Holt lives â€ “ as his hometown .
A commenter using the same screen name on various other news websites has identified himself as a member of the CofCC .
Jared Taylor , a close associate of Holt and former director of the CofCC , who said Holt had asked him to handle media inquiries relating to the massacre , said in an interview : â€œIf thereâ€ ™ s a statement that is â€˜Earl P Holt IIIâ€ ™ , he probably made it.â€ �
Several of the comments referred to black people as â€œAfricanus Criminalisâ€ � , a faux - Latin label also used in an online message for which Holt reportedly apologised in 2004 .
Holt , then a radio host in Missouri , referred to black people as â€œniggersâ€ � five times in the message .
In June 2012 the poster â€œEarl P Holt IIIâ€ � stated that he had bought and become proficient in â€œa great many weaponsâ€ � to ensure that being white did not â€œget me murderedâ€ � by non - white people .
Two months earlier the same user responded to an article about the New Black Panther Party with a request for advice on buying ammunition â€œDoes anyone know where I can get 180 grain .308
NATO rounds with a polymer tip?,â€
� he wrote .
Under a February 2014 article , the same user warned other readers that black activists would â€œkill you , rape your entire family , and burn your house to the groundâ€ � .
According to an account of a report by a witness , Roof complained to his victims in Charleston last week : â€œYou rape our women.â€ �
One comment said of black people : â€œOne can extricate them from the jungle , but one CANNOT purge the jungle from THEMâ€ � , while another said : â€œI do wish theyâ€ ™ d keep their violence and savagery within their own communitiesâ€ � .
The commenter using Holtâ€ ™ s name also complained under a story about white privilege about his taxes being distributed â€œto every baby - daddy , baby - momma , welfare cheat , drug - dealer , Oprah - watcher , felon , alcoholic , drug - addict and deadbeat in Americaâ€ � .
Holt has also distributed tens of thousands in campaign contributions among prominent Republicans in congress , such as Representative Steve King of Iowa ( $ 2,000 ) , Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas ( $ 1,500 ) and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona ( $ 1,000 ) .
He also gave $ 3,200 to the former Minnesota congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann .
Flakeâ€ ™ s office said the senator was donating the contribution to the victimsâ€ ™ family fund ."
2015-06-24,"Photographs of a Republican presidential candidate have supposedly â€œstirred outrageâ€ � in the States because they are said to have â€œeditorialised the gun violence
issueâ€ � .
The shoot - from - the - lip pro - guns Texas senator Ted Cruz was pictured by the Associated Press photographer Charlie Neibergall while speaking at a â€œcelebrate
the 2nd amendmentâ€ � event at a shooting range in Iowa at the weekend .
* Conservatives immediately turned on the news agency , which released a statement saying the five photos it issued â€œwere not intended to portray Senator Cruz in a negative lightâ€ � .
After â€œconsiderationâ€ � , said the statement , â€œwe have decided to remove those photos from further licensing through AP Imagesâ€ � .
One prominent conservative , Ann Coulter , was unimpressed with APâ€ ™ s response .
She said on Fox News : â€œThat is so outrageous .
Donâ€ ™
t insult our intelligence by saying , â€˜oh
, we didnâ€ ™ t even noticeâ€ ™ â€ � .
* I should explain that the image - which has been taken down to comply with APâ€ ™ s decision to withdraw its licence - pictured Cruz in the foreground with a poster behind him in which a large gun appeared to be aimed at his head .

2015-06-30,"Chief justice John Roberts â€œviolated his oathâ€ � when he backed Obamacare in a crucial supreme court decision last week , the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on Tuesday .
The Texas senator , who has vowed to â€œrepeal every word of Obamacareâ€ � if elected , said he was personally disappointed by the chief justiceâ€ ™ s decision to uphold Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s seminal healthcare law , during an interview with MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe .
â€œHe violated his oath , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a good enough lawyer .
He knows he did that .
It was deeply disappointing.â€ �
Cruz said on MSNBC that he considers Roberts a friend , and called him one of the best supreme court litigators alive .
The presidential contender and former Texas solicitor general added that he used to try to emulate Roberts when he litigated in front of the court .
Both Cruz and Roberts clerked for the former chief justice William Rehnquist .
Last Thursday , the justices agreed in a 6 - 3 decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act in a case that turned on the meaning a vague four - word phrase .
â€œGiven that the text is ambiguous
, we must turn to the broader structure of the act to determine the meaning , â€ � wrote Roberts in the ruling , which enraged conservatives .
â€œSadly , these will go down in his legacy as the most political decisions heâ€ ™ s ever made , â€ � Cruz told Yahoo anchor Katie Couric on Monday , also referring to a 2012 decision in which Roberts and the supreme court upheld Obamacare .
â€œAnd it is violating his oath of office .
It was heartbreaking and depressing three years ago when he did it
â€ “
and it was every bit as heartbreaking last week ,
â€ � he said .
The decision all but guarantees that Obamaâ€ ™ s healthcare reforms will survive intact until at least the 2016 election , and many supporters are hopeful that the measures will become impossible to reverse â€ “ even if a Republican is elected to the White House .
Cruz has been among the most vocal opponents of the healthcare reforms , leading a 21-hour filibuster against the law in 2013 .
He also introduced legislation to repeal the law â€ “ a promise he has also campaigned on â€ “ and has proposed an alternative plan to the presidentâ€ ™ s model .
The following day , the court ruled that same - sex couples have the right to marry in all 50 US states in a 5 - 4 decision , with Roberts joining his conservative colleagues in dissent .
Cruz called Robertsâ€ ™ s dissent on the same - sex marriage case â€œspot onâ€
� , during an interview on Monday on the conservative Hugh Hewitt show ."
2015-07-10,"Six Republican candidates touted their anti - abortion credentials on Friday at the National Right to Life Convention in New Orleans .
Marco Rubio , Rick Santorum , Rick Perry and Ben Carson all appeared on stage in front of numerous American flags and a sign that said â€œWe are a voice for the voicelessâ€ � , while Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz sent video messages to the gathering .
In recent weeks , Republicans have been pushing legislation that would ban women from having abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy , but candidates at the convention focused less on legislation and instead touted their deep opposition to abortion and their anger with the supreme court .
â€œWe have reached a point in America where the will of the people is subjugated to an oligarchy of nine lawyers and that is no longer a democracy , â€ � said former senator Rick Santorum .
â€œAnd we have an obligation to fight and we have to have people leading our country who are willing to engage in that battle.â€ �
Santorum announced in May that he would make his second bid for president and said that he has been targeted because of his beliefs .
â€œBut you know that the area that is the hardest to fight on , the one where you pay the biggest price , is on the moral and cultural issues â€ “ and none bigger than life , â€ � he said .
He drew a clear line between the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade supreme court decision that said women have the right to seek an abortion and last monthâ€ ™ s historic ruling Obergefell v Hodges , which made same - sex marriage legal across the United States .
â€œWhen
did it become the law of the land that the supreme court has the final say on anything?â€ �
Santorum said .
â€œThe American people have the final say on everything .
Thatâ€ ™ s the country I live in â€
“ is that the country you live in?â€ �
While Santorum boosted himself as the strongest â€œpro - lifeâ€ � candidate in the field , his friend Texas governor Rick Perry spent most of his 20-minute speech discussing his childhood and the importance of Christianity in his life .
He spoke comparatively little about abortion , though he has created a situation where only nine abortion clinics are open in Texas , the second most populous state .
â€œOur most basic right that we have emanates from our creator and it is that unalienable right to life , â€ � Perry said .
He too insisted on reforming the supreme court , saying that the next president could have the opportunity to pick three supreme court justices .
There is already a 5 to 4 conservative majority in the court and three of the justices are going to be more than 80 years old for the 2016 election , provoking speculation that the next president could have the opportunity to fill their seats if they retire .
â€œWe need to make sure that we come together , that we take aim , that our candidate to be nominee , not only will win , but understands how to pick credentialed conservatives for the United States supreme court because we are probably going to put three on there , â€ � Perry said .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , a co - sponsor of the 20-week abortion ban , spoke more generally about the supreme court .
He said Roe v Wade was â€œa historically , egregiously flawed decisionâ€ � that â€œhas condoned the taking of innocent life on a massive scaleâ€ � .
He said : â€œIt is fundamentally impossible for America to reach her destiny as a nation founded on the equal rights of all if our government believes an entire segment of the human population doesnâ€ ™ t have a right to exist.â€ �
Ben Carson , a retired pediatric neurosurgeon , was the only of the four candidates to not condemn the supreme court in his speech and instead warned about â€œbaby killersâ€ � and other perceived health threats .
â€œThe baby killers , thatâ€ ™ s what they do
, they manipulate you into thinking this is not a human being
and they capitalize on peopleâ€
™ s
lack of knowledge and understanding , â€ � Carson said .
Carson implied that liberal policies could lead to euthanasia and rationed healthcare .
â€œIt is the natural consequences of the kind of thinking that has become pervasive in our society , â€ � he said .
Two Republican presidential hopefuls sent videos to the convention .
Florida governor Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s video was less than three minutes long and focused on what he did in Florida to restrict abortion .
â€œWhen
we devalue life , whether itâ€ ™ s at the beginning of life or at the end , we devalue our society , we devalue our culture , â€ �
Bush said in his campaign - style video .
Texas senator Ted Cruz provided a six - minute address where he spoke extensively about how conservative Texas politicians defeated state senator Wendy Davis , who filibustered for 11 hours to stall a bill that would close nearly every abortion clinic in the state .
â€œOur founders had the foreknowledge to protect life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , in that order , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œWithout life , there is no liberty , Without life , there is no pursuit of happiness .
Abortion is a stain on our nationâ€ ™ s history.â€ �"
2015-07-26,"Bernie Sanders could participate in a one - on - one , leftwing versus right debate with Ted Cruz during the presidential primary , without violating restrictive rules set by the Democratic and Republican national committees .
The two senators would just have to face off at their workplace , the US Capitol .
The first debate of the extended primary election will see the top 10 Republican candidates in a field of 16 face off in Cleveland on 6 August , in an event hosted by Fox News .
Both parties have made clear that if candidates appear in unsanctioned debates , they will be barred from any official debates .
But staffers for both the DNC and RNC confirmed that the restrictions on presidential debates do not apply to debates held on the floor of Congress .
Sean Spicer , the chief strategist for the RNC , told the Guardian : â€œSenate business would not be a violation.â€ � Sanders , a self - professed democratic socialist who represents Vermont as an independent but is running for the Democratic nomination , attracting large crowds and performing well in the polls , has long expressed a willingness to debate Republican rivals one on one .
In an interview with MSNBC in June he said he wanted to do so in order to expose what he called â€œan absolutely reactionary agendaâ€ � .
In the interview , Sanders emphasized how much he valued â€œthe clash of ideasâ€ � , which he said led to â€œpeople becom[ing ]
more engaged in the political processâ€ � .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a good thing for progressives , â€ � he said .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a good thing for American democracy.â€ �
Cruz , a rightwing hardliner who is trailing in presidential polls , this week departed from normal Senate behavior by accusing from the floor of the chamber one of his party leaders , Mitch McConnell , of lying .
He has welcomed the possibility of a debate with Sanders .
In Iowa last week , he told reporters : â€œI welcome as many debates as possible , â€ � adding that he was â€œin for any discussionâ€ � .
Now the two presidential candidates have the possibility of making such a debate happen , albeit with the caveat that it would have to happen on the Senate floor , according to the rules of that chamber ."
2015-07-27,"The increasingly shrill tone of the Republican presidential campaign has provoked a rare overseas rebuke from Barack Obama , who criticised candidates like Donald Trump , Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz for lacking â€œseriousness , decorum and honestyâ€ � .
During an official visit to Ethiopia , the president broke with diplomatic protocol to wade into domestic US politics instead and respond to those on the American political right who have recently compared his administrationâ€ ™ s policies to Nazi death camps and the crucifixion of Christ .
â€œPart of what historically has made America great is , particularly when it comes to foreign policy , thereâ€ ™ s been a recognition that these issues are too serious , that issues of war and peace of such grave concern and consequence , that we donâ€
™ t play fast and loose that way , â€ � Obama told reporters .
â€œWe have robust debates , we look at the facts , there are going to be disagreements .
But we just donâ€ ™ t fling out ad hominem attacks like that because it doesnâ€ ™ t help inform the American people.â€
�
The outburst was prompted by a question about Mike Huckabeeâ€
™ s claim that the Iran nuclear deal would â€œtake the Israelis and march them to the door of the ovenâ€ � .
But Obama argued the problem was more than just a disagreement over this current deal and singled out similar comments by Arkansas senator Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz , the Texas senator and 2016 candidate .
â€œThe particular comments of Mr Huckabee are I think part of just a general pattern weâ€ ™ ve seen that would be considered ridiculous if it werenâ€ ™ t so sad , â€ � he said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve had a sitting senator call John Kerry Pontius Pilate .
Weâ€ ™ ve had a sitting senator who also happens to be running for president
suggest that Iâ€ ™ m the leading state sponsor of terrorism .
These are leaders in the Republican party.â€ � Obama also broke his relative silence on Donald Trump , whose outspoken attacks on both the president and more moderate Republicans have dominated the 2016 campaign agenda in recent week .
â€œWhen you get rhetoric like this maybe it gets attention , maybe this is just an attempt to push Mr Trump out of the headlines , but itâ€ ™ s not the kind of leadership thatâ€ ™ s needed for America right now , â€ � said the president .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s what anybody â€ “ Democrat or Republican or independent â€ “ is looking for out of their political leaders.â€ �
Trump has embarrassed many on the right too , with his attack on the war record of Vietnam prisoner and former Republican nominee John McCain prompting even conservatives like former Texas governor Rick Perry to dismiss him as a â€œbarking carnival actâ€ � .
But Obama is now accusing others in the 2016 race of chasing after Trump , and questioned why they remained silent when similar personal attacks were made about Democrats .
â€œItâ€
™ s been interesting when you look at whatâ€ ™ s been happening with Mr Trump , when heâ€ ™ s made some of the remarks that for example challenged the heroism of Mr McCain â€ “ somebody who endured torture and conducted himself with exemplary patriotism â€ “ the Republican party is shocked and yet that arises out of a culture where those outrageous kind of attacks have become far too commonplace and yet circulate non - stop through the internet and talk radio and news outlets , â€ � said the president at the press conference in Addis Ababa .
â€œWhen outrageous statements like that are made about me that a lot of the same people who were outraged when they were made about Mr McCain were pretty quiet , â€ � he added .
Obama also implied he regarded several of those candidates who have been most outspoken in their attacks as not fit to lead the Republican party , let alone take over from him in the White House .
â€œThe point is weâ€ ™ re making a culture that is not conducive to good policy or good politics .
The American people deserve better .
Certainly presidential debates deserve better , â€ � said the president .
â€œIn 18 months Iâ€ ™ m turning over the keys ; I want to make sure Iâ€ ™ m turning over the keys to somebody who is serious about the serious problems the country faces and the world faces , and that requires on both sides , Democrat and Republican , a sense of seriousness and decorum and honesty .
I think thatâ€ ™ s what the voters expect as well.â€ �
Nonetheless , the sight of the commander - in - chief using an official overseas trip to make political attacks on his partyâ€ ™ s opponents at home is likely to only inflame the increasing rancorous debate over foreign policy .
Huckabee was quick to respond to the presidential swipe , by doubling down on his comparison of the Iranian deal to Nazi appeasement .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s ridiculous and sad is that President Obama does not take the Iran threats seriously .
For decades , Iranian leaders have pledged to â€˜destroyâ€ ™ , â€˜annihilateâ€ ™ and â€˜wipe Israel off the mapâ€ ™ with a â€˜big Holocaustâ€ ™ ,â€ � he said in a statement .
â€œ â€˜Never againâ€ ™ will be the policy of my administration and I will stand with our ally Israel to prevent the terrorists in Tehran from achieving their own stated goal of another Holocaust.â€ �"
2015-08-01,"The competition among Republican presidential candidates for the support of the political and fundraising network of Charles and David Koch will heat up this weekend .
Five Republican candidates will attend a retreat held by Freedom Partners , a key cog in the political network of the Koch brothers .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Texas senator Ted Cruz , former CEO Carly Fiorina , Florida senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker will all attend a gathering of well - heeled GOP donors at a luxury resort in Orange County , California .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul was invited but declined to attend , citing previous commitments to campaign in Iowa .
The event is designed to boost those who the Koch brothers consider to be in â€œa top tier of candidatesâ€ � who , in the words of one person familiar with the efforts of the Koch network , â€œare most likely to elevate a serious debate on the principles of freedomâ€ � .
All five candidates will participate in a moderated policy discussion with Politico reporter Mike Allen and will be able to mix and mingle with the approximately 450 high - powered donors expected to attend .
However , the current frontrunner will not be in that top tier of GOP candidates .
Donald Trump is not considered among the candidates who are most capable of elevating that debate and Politico has reported that the Koch network is â€œfreezing him outâ€ � .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
signature policy , his hostility to immigration from Mexico and Latin America , runs counter to the Kochsâ€ ™ support for immigration reform and efforts to sell Hispanic Americans on conservative ideas .
The Koch network has long funded the Libre Initiative , a group dedicated to â€œadvanc[ing ] the principles and values of economic freedom to empower the US Hispanic communityâ€ � .
The Trump campaign declined to comment .
Even if Trump were welcome at the event , it would counteract the increasingly populist message of the bellicose billionaire .
The former reality television star has flaunted his wealth to demonstrate his independence from special interests in politics .
At a campaign event in Iowa earlier in July , Trump said of Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush : â€œThose people are controlled by whoever gave them their money , and I will tell you they are totally controlled.â€ �
He boasted of buying influence with politicians himself in the past :
â€œI give to everybody and they do whatever I say.â€
�
Trump hasnâ€ ™ t quite gone as far as to criticize the Koch network by name .
His only mention so far came in a tweet on Wednesday :
â€œI really like the Koch Brothers ( members of my P.B. Club ) , but I donâ€ ™ t want their money or anything else from them .
Can not influence Trump!â€
�
The real estate mogul isnâ€ ™ t being singled out , though .
A number of other candidates have also not been invited , including Ohio governor John Kasich , whose support for expanding Medicaid in the Buckeye State has made him anathema to many in the Koch network .
Like Trump , not only will Kasich not be attending this weekendâ€ ™ s event in California , but he will be absent from another Koch - affiliated event in Ohioâ€ ™ s state capital of Columbus in September .
The Ohio governor reportedly alienated attendees at the Koch - affiliated conference in 2014 by giving a fiery defense of his decision to expand Medicaid .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know about you , lady ,
â€ �
Kasich told one prominent Republican donor .
â€œBut when I get to the pearly gates , Iâ€ ™ m going to have an answer for what Iâ€ ™ ve done for the poor.â€ �
According to Politico , roughly 20 attendees walked out of the room in protest at the Ohio governorâ€ ™ s answer .
The event , which lasts through the weekend , will be the last significant milestone on the Republican primary calendar before the first debate , sponsored by Fox News , is held in Cleveland on 6 August ."
2015-08-03,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has stated that he doesnâ€ ™ t believe in the science behind global warming .
In a forum hosted by Freedom Partners on Sunday evening , a key cog in the political network of the Koch Brothers , the Texas senator stated that â€œthe data and facts donâ€ ™ t supportâ€ � that global warming is occurring .
The moderator of the forum described Cruzâ€ ™ s stance as â€œfull out denialâ€ � .
The Texas senator did not disagree with that characterisation .
Cruz has previously compared those who believe in global warming to â€œflat - Earthers.â€ �
Cruz also criticised the new regulations , set to be unveiled by the Obama administration on Monday , to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants .
To the Republican presidential candidate , these new rules were a sign that the Democratic party had abandoned union members for â€œCalifornia environmentalist billionaires and their campaign donationsâ€ � , in a clear reference to hedge fund mogul and environmentalist Tom Steyer .
In denying global warming , which Cruz saw as a Trojan horse used by liberals to impose â€œmassive government controlâ€ � on the economy , the Texas Republican distinguishes himself from many others in the GOP field .
Earlier , 2016 rival Marco Rubio also attacked the new regulations , although the Florida senator was loth to address the science behind global warming .
In contrast , other Republicans , like former Florida governor Jeb Bush , have acknowledged that the planet is getting warmer .
However , Bush did have some fierce words for the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s plans on Sunday .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a disaster .
Itâ€ ™ s typical of the Obama administration , taking the power he doesnâ€ ™ t have , â€ � he told the audience at the Freedom Partners forum .
He added that he thought the regulations were both â€œunconstitutionalâ€ � and â€œa job killerâ€ � .
Research by the federal government shows that the rate of global warming has been steady and unchanging in recent years and that 2014 was the warmest year on record ."
2015-08-03,"Food safety experts and gun experts have warned against cooking bacon on the barrel of a machine gun , after Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz released a video showing him doing just that .
The film , published on conservative website IJReview , shows Cruz carefully wrapping rashers around the barrel of what appears to be a semi - automatic rifle .
The Texas senator then fires off several rounds , apparently cooking the bacon from the heat of the weapon .
â€œThere are few things I enjoy more than on weekends cooking breakfast with the family , â€ �
Cruz says in the video , titled Making Machine - Gun Bacon with Ted Cruz .
â€œOf
course in Texas , we cook bacon a little differently than most folks ,
â€ � he adds .
However when the Guardian contacted FoodSafety.gov â€ “ a federal website dedicated to promoting safe food consumption â€
“
a representative said the Texas method of bacon - cooking was unsafe .
â€œI do not recommend cooking bacon that way
, â€ � a FoodSafety.gov representative said during an online chat .
â€œThere is no way to accurately tell if the bacon is getting the proper amount of heat using this form of cooking.â€ � Hygiene could be a problem as well , the representative said .
â€œCleanliness is also a concern here .
You want to make sure the surface you are using to prepare food is well sanitized and clean .
The end of a machine gun is not recommended.â€ �
In the video Cruz , who is hoping to become the Republican candidate for the White House , is shown applying the bacon directly to the barrel of his gun .
The senator carefully wraps tinfoil around his rashers before firing at a target .
Gun manufacturers Smith and Wesson also advised against this method of cooking .
â€œWe certainly wouldnâ€ ™ t recommend you cooking bacon on that ,
â€ � a representative said .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t think the gun is designed to cook bacon.â€ �
Using a gun to cook bacon could also have other implications .
â€œItâ€ ™ s grease , â€ � the Smith and Wesson representative said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not designed to do that and if anything bad was to happen it wouldnâ€ ™ t be covered under the warranty thatâ€ ™ s for sure.â€ �"
2015-08-03,"One of 24 Republican sponsors of a bill to withdraw federal funding from Planned Parenthood said he did not support a potential government shutdown over the issue , ahead of a vote scheduled for Monday .
Appearing on CNN on Sunday , the Kentucky senator and candidate for the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination in 2016 , said : â€œI support any legislation that will defund Planned Parenthood .
But I donâ€ ™ t think you start out with your objective to shut down the government.â€ �
Another sponsor and 2016 hopeful , Texas senator Ted Cruz â€ “ a driving force behind the shutdown of October 2013 , over the Affordable Care Act
â€ “ floated the possibility of another shutdown last week .
Most Republicans are wary of the political cost of such a course .
Paul , however , echoed some voices on the right when he suggested that if the federal budget was not approved because of a political issue such as abortion , the fault would lie with the White House .
â€œIf President Obama wants to shut down the government because he doesnâ€ ™ t get funds for Planned Parenthood , â€ �
he said , â€œthat would be President Obamaâ€ ™ s determination to shut down the government.â€ � Planned Parenthood , which in its most recent annual report said it performed 328,000 of around 1 million abortions carried out in the US each year , has been at the centre of a political storm over the release of â€œundercoverâ€ � videos in which officials appear to discuss the sale of body parts from aborted foetuses .
Planned Parenthood has apologised for comments made by employees in the video but says it has broken no laws .
It accuses opponents of using selective editing for an assault on womenâ€ ™ s health choices .
Last week , the organisation said it had notified the FBI and the Department of Justice that hackers were attempting to access employee data .
Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards , meanwhile , wrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post in which she called the attacks â€œa new lowâ€ � and their creators â€œextremistsâ€ � .
The 24 Republican senators unveiled their legislation last Wednesday , before the release of a fourth such video by the Center for Medical Progress , an anti - abortion group lauded by conservatives .
The bill is expected to be blocked by Democrats or vetoed by Obama should it reach his desk , a prospect which prompted Cruzâ€ ™ s suggestion of a shutdown as a means of forcing the issue .
Democrats including presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton have stuck to their supportive stance regarding Planned Parenthood .
But as the first Republican debate approaches , the videos have stirred passions among the 17 candidates for the GOP nomination .
Referring to media controversy over the killing of a lion in Zimbabwe by a dentist from Minnesota , the Florida senator Marco Rubio tweeted : â€œLook at all this outrage over a dead lion , but where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies.â€ �
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee did not rule out using federal troops and law enforcement to stop abortions taking place anywhere .
Paul , who in April said it â€œsounded likeâ€ �
Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schulz was â€œOK with killing a 7 lb babyâ€ � , released an ad which said Planned Parenthood received â€œover a half a million tax dollars every yearâ€ � for performing â€œabortions and sell[ing
] baby body
partsâ€ � .
The ad also described the candidate as a â€œpro - life doctorâ€ � and pictured him posing in a white doctorâ€ ™ s coat labelled â€œRand Paul MDâ€ � .
Paul is a qualified ophthalmologist .
On his Facebook page , Paul announced a â€œDefund Planned Parenthood Money Bombâ€ � , seeking donations of â€œ$20.16 or moreâ€ � to â€œhelp me turn up the heat on my allies in Congressâ€ � and â€œgive us the best chance to pass my bill to finally strip Planned Parenthood of every dime of our tax dollars before the August recessâ€ � .
On Sunday , on CNN , he took a slightly more conciliatory line .
â€œI think we can have disputes , you know , over abortion , â€ � he said .
â€œOur country is divided .
Some people are pro - choice .
Some are pro - life .
But I think a lot of people , even a lot of pro - choice people , are upset by these videos .
â€œThey , you know , [ are ] manipulating the baby , turning the baby around to get the body parts and then selling the liver and the doctors [ are ] cavalierly saying : â€˜Oh , well , yes , liver is popular right now for sale.â€ ™ â€œI think most Americans donâ€ ™ t want their tax dollars going to this .
So I think when something is so morally repugnant to so many people , why should tax dollars go to this?â€ �
The legislation up for a vote on Monday would bar federal aid to Planned Parenthood and shift the money to other healthcare providers .
Introducing the bill on Wednesday , Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said : â€œThis bill will ensure that taxpayer dollars that are supposed to be spent on womenâ€ ™ s health are , in fact , spent on womenâ€ ™ s health.â€ � Planned Parenthood , which points out that abortions represent only a fraction of the healthcare services it provides to women nationwide , says that of $ 1.3bn in revenue last year , $ 528 m came from taxpayers , including state funds that help finance Medicaid .
The organisationâ€ ™ s defenders say cutting federal aid would not affect abortions , because such money can not be used for such procedures except in cases of rape or incest or when a womanâ€ ™ s life is in danger .
Republicans say nearly 9,100 federally funded community health centres â€ “ more than 10 times the number of Planned Parenthood locations â€ “ could pick up the slack .
Planned Parenthood says its sites serve disproportionate numbers of low - income women and are often situated where no alternatives exist .
Paul said he supported â€œsome funding for community health centresâ€
� because â€œthere are people who do need helpâ€ � .
â€œBut really , â€ � he said , â€œPlanned Parenthood is sort of a front for doing abortion.â€ �
Returning to a political point set to feature heavily in the Republican primary , he added : â€œI think if you look at it objectively , people would say , why do we have to get involved with a group thatâ€ ™ s , you know , selling baby organs , you know ?
â€œEven pro - choice people are upset by these videos .
So , I mean , I think the country ought to wake up and we ought to get rid of this funding.â€ �"
2015-08-13,"The most shocking thing about the Republican debate last week â€ “ apart from the discovery that Ted Cruz is only 44 â€
“ was the way in which we were made to take Donald Trump seriously .
When analysts talk about a candidate being the kind youâ€ ™ d want to have a drink with we understand them , at some level , to be talking metaphorically .
In Trumpâ€ ™ s case he literally sounds like the guy mouthing off at the bar , slightly squiffy and up for a fight .
Far from undermining Trump , this intemperance plays in his favour .
The degree to which a candidate is identified as that most coveted thing in a presidential race â€ “ a political outsider â€ “ comes down in large part to language .
Hillary Clinton , the wonkâ€ ™ s wonk , is capable of making a speech about energy that includes references to â€œgeologic sequestrationâ€ � and â€œcellulosic ethanolâ€ � .
Obama , too , is sometimes thought to be too academic and both have had problems with the charge of elitism .
And here is Trump , talking in the kind of amazing non sequiturs that plagued Sarah Palin , but without the panic that ultimately killed her .
When a host on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press asked Trump if he had meant , in his now infamous remarks , to refer to Megyn Kellyâ€ ™ s menstrual cycle , he replied : â€œHey , I went to the Wharton School of Finance , the toughest place to get into .
I was a great student .
I donâ€
™ t talk that way.â€ � Over on CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union , he answered a similar question with , â€œI went to the Wharton School of Finance .
I was an excellent student .
Iâ€ ™ m a smart person .
I built a tremendous company .
I had a show called The Apprentice that NBC desperately wanted me to do another season .
I do all this stuff .
Do you think I make a stupid statement like that?â€
�
This rehearsed inarticulacy , with its weird boasts and odd syntax , is Trumpâ€ ™ s signal to voters that , like a rightwing version of Warren Beatty in Bulworth , you should vote for him because he just doesnâ€ ™ t care .
Itâ€ ™ s an odd paradox , a kind of nihilism masquerading as the human touch , one that has served Nigel Farage well in Britain .
Both men give the impression theyâ€ ™ ll say any old thing , since caution is the refuge of the weak .
Both use the word â€œstuffâ€
� a lot .
( â€œThereâ€ ™ s important stuff to contemplate , about Labour in the south - east of England , â€ � said Farage earlier this year ) , a verbal shrug that says : Iâ€ ™ m so sure of myself I donâ€
™ t mind sounding stupid .
And both have more than a pinch of self - mockery , something scarce on the ground in politics , which in Trump manifests itself as wild self - aggrandising :
â€œWhen I was attacked viciously by those women , of course , itâ€ ™ s very hard for them to attack me on looks , because Iâ€ ™ m so good - looking.â€ � Farage , on the other hand , knows that in England the way to ingratiate yourself is through self - deprecation , and so talks about how â€œuselessâ€ � he is , confesses heâ€
™ d be a bad prime minister and describes his own partyâ€ ™ s manifesto as â€œa complete Horlicksâ€ � .
The Brits already know this , but as Trump watchers discovered in the US this week , itâ€ ™ s hard to land a blow on the guy who treats the whole thing as a joke .
A waffle too far in New York To get away from it all
, I walked to the new beer garden in New Yorkâ€ ™ s Central Park .
On the way , I passed my local supermarket , which sells a product called Stroopwafel .
I passed the Wafels and Dinges snack cart on the corner of Broadway .
At the park , I ordered bratwurst and a friend ordered schnitzel .
You used to have to go all the way to Astoria , in Queens , for Belgian beer and confectionery .

2015-08-17,"Itâ€ ™ s not unusual for presidential campaigns to deploy staffers across the country in the year before voting begins .
But Republican candidate Ted Cruz has gone one step further and sent an operative across the Pacific Ocean .
The Cruz campaign has dispatched political consultant Dennis Lennox to Guam to organize in advance of that islandâ€ ™ s GOP caucuses .
The decision to send Lennox , a former county drain commissioner in his native Michigan , to Guam represents the most zealous outreach of any presidential campaign to the US island territory located nearly 8,000 miles from Washington DC .
David Sablan , a Republican National Committee member from Guam , said last week that Cruz had dispatched an operative to the island and said his was one of only three presidential campaigns that had reached out to Guam Republicans .
The other two campaigns were those of former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker .
Sablan said that he had met personally with Bush , talked with him about the campaign and continued to stay â€œin touch with peopleâ€ � .
In addition , he mentioned that the Walker campaign was â€œmaking some overturesâ€ � and doing outreach to get a sense of the island territoryâ€ ™ s delegate selection plan .
However , the Cruz campaign , which did not respond to a request for comment , was the only one to actually have a presence on the ground in Guam .
While Guam only has nine delegates out of the total of 2,470 who will attend the Republican convention in Cleveland in July 2016 , it is far more significant than its size would indicate under RNC rules .
Under rules passed in 2012 , any Republican candidate needs the support of a majority of delegates from eight states to have his name placed into nomination .
Under RNC rules , a territory is considered a state and winning Guam makes it that much easier for a candidate to tally the eight states necessary if there ends up being a floor fight in Cleveland next year .
A floor fight is where the identity of the nominee has not been determined prior to the convention and the primary ends with an actual vote with consequences on the convention floor .
Sablan said the island lends itself to retail campaigning .
â€œGuam is maybe a third the size of Rhode Island , â€ �
he said .
â€œIt is very easy to get around and talk to a few people.â€ �
Sablan noted that it was very probable that , at the convention , delegates â€œgo to one candidateâ€ � right away and lock up one of the eight states needed at the RNC .
In 2012 , Mitt Romney won all nine of Guamâ€ ™ s delegates after being backed by 207 of the 216 delegates to Guamâ€ ™ s territorial Republican convention .
All this effort in Guam may be for naught .
There has not been a true floor flight at a Republican convention since 1976 .
But , with 17 candidates in the running for the GOP nomination , it is possible this may be the year that that pattern changes .
And , if so , it is clear which campaigns are already playing the long game ."
2015-08-21,"Presidential hopefuls are used to having animated conversations about policy at the Iowa State Fair .
But their interlocutors are not always Oscar - nominated actors .
On Friday , Texas senator Ted Cruz engaged in a heated debate about LGBT rights and religious liberty with Juno and Inception star Ellen Page while flipping pork burgers at the Iowa State Fair .
Page , who came out as gay in a 2014 speech , initially asked Cruz about his opposition to ENDA , federal legislation which would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation .
The Texas Republican responded to Pageâ€ ™ s initial question by arguing â€œwhat weâ€ ™ re seeing right now is actually Bible - believing Christians being persecutedâ€ � .
Cruz is hosting a â€œrally for religious libertyâ€ � in Des Moines on Friday night , and mentioned the Odegaards , a couple due to appear at his event .
The Texas Republican said that the Iowa couple , who have a wedding chapel on their property , were approached by a gay couple who wanted to hold their wedding there .
The Odegaards refused , citing their religious faith , and ended up facing litigation as result , which they settled out of court for $ 5,000 .
The Texas senator felt that the Odegaards should have been free to refuse to host the gay coupleâ€ ™ s wedding and said he also believed that a gay florist would have the right to refuse to provide flowers to an evangelical wedding .
Cruz went on to claim that there is â€œliberal intoleranceâ€ � against â€œanyone that dares follow the biblical teaching of marriageâ€ � .
Page disagreed and argued that â€œthere needs to be more tolerance for LGBT people .
It used to be illegal and they were thrown in jail and they have come a really long way.â€ �
Cruz then argued that gay people faced the most discrimination from Isis and Iran and tried to attack Obama for reaching a nuclear deal with the Iranian regime .
Page then pointed out that gay people faced violence and discrimination from â€œChristians in Russia , Christians in Uganda , Christians in Jamaicaâ€ � .
The Texas senator then said â€œmurder is murder and it is wrongâ€ � but argued â€œthere is a difference between a community like Jamaica which has different standards ; it may not have gay pride parades but they arenâ€ ™ t murdering people.â€
�
Page then responded accurately that â€œa lot of gay people are getting killed in Jamaicaâ€ � .
A 2014 report from the global NGO Human Rights Watch said there was â€œunchecked homophobic violenceâ€ � in Jamaica .
Shortly afterwards , Cruz abruptly ended his exchange with Page .
The Texas Republican told reporters afterwards : â€œI think the conversation is about persecution of religious liberty and she didnâ€ ™ t want to have that conversation.â€ � Page , who â€ “ like Cruz â€ “ was born in Canada , has long been an active critic of the Texas senator ."
2015-08-21,"Itâ€ ™ s
August , the heat is miserable , kids are going back to school and that means one thing for Americaâ€ ™ s conservatives :
itâ€ ™ s the perfect time to take a cheap shot at the nationâ€ ™ s teachers .
John Kasich , the Republican governor of Ohio â€ “ who is generally considered less extreme than Texas Senator Ted Cruz , less dynastic than former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and less crazy than professional troll Donald Trump â€ “ recently said : â€œIf I were , not president , if I were king in America , I would abolish all teachersâ€ ™ lounges where they sit together and worry about â€˜woe is
usâ€ ™ .â€ � Kasich addressed a New Hampshire â€œeducation summitâ€ � sponsored by the 74 Million , an education â€œnews siteâ€ � which Huffington Post points out is run by failed CNN host Campbell Brown â€œdespite having little to no training in education , and never having taught students herself.â€ �
Many other Republican presidential hopefuls , including Governors Bush , Scott Walker of Wisconsin , Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Chris Christie of New Jersey , addressed the gathering .
Republicans love to hate teachers and imply that all the ills of US society are the result of their laziness .
If only schools could be turned over to market forces and not held back by greedy teacher unions , conservative logic goes , everything would be fine
â€ “ even though charter schools perform no better than traditional schools .
Trying to bust unions in general ( and those of teachers in particular ) turns conservatives on as much as trying to deny climate change , defend the NRA , defund Planned Parenthood or battle for a check from the Koch brothers .
But trying to deny teachers a place to rest for a few minutes between classes , as Kasich is fantasizing about , is ludicrous .
Whatâ€ ™ s wrong with having a place to eat a snack between classes or talk to other teachers about lesson plans and their common students without 30 children within ear shot ?
According to Politicoâ€ ™ s analysis of Kasichâ€ ™ s 45 minute conversation with Brown , the Republican hopeful wants to remove teachersâ€ ™ lounges to keep educators from complaining to one another and , presumably , to keep them from colluding in greed to protect their benefits and working conditions .
Imagine the possibilities .
Without a place to meet , teachers â€ “ who already work alone in most classrooms â€ “ could be even more isolated .
Sure , theyâ€ ™ d be unable to exchange teaching techniques or ideas for improvement , but theyâ€ ™ d also be working with more alienation .
Politico notes that Randi Weingarten , president of the American Federation of Teachers ( which has already endorsed Hillary Clinton ) , asked Kasich on Twitter :
â€œafter u get rid of places
teachers eat lunch ,
whatâ€ ™ s next -getting rid of teachersâ€ ™ chairs
so they stand all day?â€ �
But this has already happened long ago at least at one non - unionized charter school I know .
Years ago , I reported about the Imagine Me Leadership Charter School in Brooklyn â€ “ a publicly funded , privately managed school housed in a church complex in Brooklyn â€ “ where teachers were not allowed to have desks in their rooms .
As the principal told me in 2011 : â€œWe believe teachers need to be on their feet , working with the kids.â€ �
Every minute of every day .
So forget the lounges : sitting has become stigmatized for teachers , even at a desk .
The idea that a teacher might need to sit â€ “ say , to grade a paper , write down attendance or give their feet a momentâ€ ™
s
rest during a long day â€ “ was recast as a potential cause for poor student performance .
Republicans have always hated teachersâ€ ™ unions for obvious reasons .
They reliably support the Democratic party , even though Democrats routinely go to war against teachers as well , particularly alumni from the Obama administration .
Teachersâ€ ™ unions are made up of groups Republicans always love to bash : government workers with lady parts .
Often , when school closure fights happen between unions and austerity politicians , it is black teachers who are the most likely to lose their jobs .
So teacher unions and Republicans are natural enemies .
Indeed , all year Republican presidential hopefuls have gleefully slashed education budgets , with Walker eroding tenure and some $ 250 m from public colleges in Wisconsin and Jindal cutting $ 300 m from Louisianaâ€ ™ s state college system .
Cutting teachersâ€ ™ lounges would have the â€œbenefitâ€ � of saving a little money - another classroom could go in that wasteful space , Kasich might argue .
But more importantly , it could deplete camaraderie and morale for instructors at the same time .
Thatâ€ ™ s what Republicans would call a win - win .
Still , the rhetoric about their hatred of teachers is getting more violent , heated and punitive .
Christie , who has been yelling at teachers for a while , recently said teachers unions deserved a â€œpolitical punch in the faceâ€ � for being the â€œsingle most destructive forceâ€ � in education .
The real â€œmost destructive forceâ€ � in American education right now is not teachers .
It is the fact that many of the top contenders for the countryâ€ ™ s highest office , running in one of the nationâ€ ™ s two major political parties , are against science , against immigrants , against women - and against supporting the workforce which teaches our children ."
2015-08-22,"The Texas senator and Republican presidential campaigner Ted Cruz on Saturday told a Koch brothers - sponsored gathering he would have a busy agenda on his first day in the White House .
Speaking to activists at the annual summit of Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) in Columbus , Ohio , Cruz said if elected he would rescind â€œevery single illegal and unconstitutional executive orderâ€ � signed by President Barack Obama , begin investigating the womenâ€ ™ s health organisation Planned Parenthood , â€œrip to shredsâ€
� the Iranian nuclear deal and order all federal agencies to end the religious persecution of Christians .
Cruz â€ “ who on Friday night in Iowa was publicly challenged on LGBT rights by the actress Ellen Paige â€
“ was the first of three GOP presidential contenders to speak on Saturday to a packed crowd .
Florida senator Marco Rubio and former Texas governor Rick Perry were the others .
The former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal spoke on Friday .
Cruz peppered his address with jokes , scriptural references and jabs at Obama and the Democratic frontrunner for 2016 Hillary Clinton .
He said he was the best choice among the 17-strong Republican field because he would always do what he said he was going to do .
Among Cruzâ€ ™ s jokes was a remark that he would like to see the Internal Revenue Service discontinued and its 90,000 employees used to guard the US - Mexico border .
Rubio , following Cruz , told the audience US economic growth was lagging because other countries were doing better at what the US set in motion but abandoned .
He said : â€œThere are dozens of countries that have learned from our example â€ ¦ so the first thing we must do is become globally competitive again .
Thatâ€ ™ s why we talk about tax reform.â€
�
The crowd cheered often during his 20-minute speech , and laughed at his jokes , though not as fervently as they did during Cruzâ€ ™ s speech .
Unlike Cruz , who appeared in shirtsleeves , Rubio , at 43 the youngest GOP candidate , wore a dark suit , white shirt and Republican - red tie .
The latest RealClearPolitics.com polls average puts Cruz at 7.3 % support among likely Republican voters , enough for sixth place and a position in the next main debate .
Rubio is a place ahead with 7.6 % while Perry is 12th , with 1.3 % .
Donald Trump , the clear leader in polls concerning the Republican primary field , was not invited to the AFP event , which is sponsored by the vastly influential and wealthy Kochs .
AFP president Tim Phillips told Reuters the group would keep its â€œlaserâ€ � focus on issues like tax reform , repealing the Affordable Care Act and fighting environmental regulations , no matter who was eventually elected .
â€œWe talked to people who had records that for the most part were philosophically aligned with us , â€ � Phillips said , adding that â€œwe didnâ€ ™ t want a cattle callâ€ � while noting that Trump had appeared at past AFP events .
According to AFP , 3,600 people attended .
Among them , support for and criticism of Trump was evident .
â€œIt really frustrates me when he bashes other candidates â€ “ and theyâ€ ™ re really cheap personal shots , â€ � said Althea Cole , 31 and from Cedar Rapids , Iowa , a county chairwoman for the campaign of the neurosurgeon Ben Carson .
Cole , however , had some admiration for Trumpâ€ ™ s business success .
â€œThe manâ€ ™ s a jackass , but you donâ€
™ t get to be a billionaire by making friends , â€ � she said .
A group of college students from a Republican club at Augustana College in South Dakota felt Trump was too much of a bully .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s mocking it with his presence , â€ � said Cara Beck , 20 , as she stood with five male students between 19 and 21 years of age .
Their picks for president were Bush , former Ohio governor John Kasich , Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Rubio .
Among a group of young Tennesseans , Trump garnered mixed reactions â€ “ plaudits for his business acumen , and boos for the reality TV starâ€ ™ s showmanship .
â€œBoth my parents love Donald Trump
but I canâ€ ™ t stand him , â€ � said Michael Stooksbury , 18 , who liked Paul best .
â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t have any experience ,
heâ€ ™ s just an entertainer.â€ �
Thomas Parham , 29 , said the US could benefit from Trumpâ€ ™ s business background .
â€œIâ€ ™

â€œThat way we can take over country after country , territory after territory , without firing a single shot.â€ �"
2015-09-08,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally against the Iran nuclear deal on Wednesday â€ “ whose guest star will be his rival Donald Trump â€
“ is the tip of an iceberg of campaigning and fundraising to thwart the deal by non - profits funded partly by casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson , conservative groups and other GOP candidates such as Marco Rubio .
These drives to block the nuclear accord on Capitol Hill are going strong , even though the White House has locked up enough Democratic Senate supporters to ensure it has the votes to sustain a veto from Barack Obama of any resolution of disapproval that anti - deal congresspeople do manage to pass .
And some of these groups are readying drives for more sanctions against Tehran to replace ones set to expire as part of the nuclear deal .
Over the summer , Texas senator Cruz helped forge a coalition of staunchly pro - Israel and conservative groups which has worked aggressively to build backing for congressional resolutions opposing the nuclear deal , a top Obama administration priority .
And a non - profit group set up by allies of Senator Rubio of Florida has spent about $ 4.5 m on an ad blitz in which Rubio blasts the nuclear deal , and may spend more , a spokesman for the group said .
The high - stakes fight could also yield political dividends for GOP presidential candidates , say Republican operatives and other conservatives .
â€œAggressively fighting the Iran deal benefits you with activists , and has a not - so - small side benefit of pleasing one of the GOPâ€ ™ s most generous donors , â€ � one veteran GOP operative said , referring to mega - donor Adelson , a staunch opponent of the deal .
Mort Klein , president of the Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) , a group which historically has been heavily funded by Adelson and is co - sponsoring Wednesdayâ€ ™ s rally , praised Cruz as a â€œman who tells the truthâ€ � about the Iran nuclear deal , and said that â€œinadvertently this could benefit his appeal to some donorsâ€ � .
The lobbying battle royale has pitted Republicans , conservative groups and some Democrats , who argue the nuclear agreement is not strong enough and poses a serious threat to the security of Israel and the United States , against the administration and a growing number of Democratic allies who insist it will significantly diminish the Iranian nuclear threat for at least a decade .
Rubio and Cruz are among several candidates vying intensely for Adelsonâ€ ™ s financial backing .
A close ally of the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , and an implacable foe of the Iran deal , Adelson has poured millions of dollars into a few of the big ad efforts under way by outside groups , according to three conservatives with ties to the Las Vegas mogul .
Adelson , who in 2013 suggested dropping a nuclear bomb in the Iranian desert as a warning to Tehran against building nuclear weapons , has also made personal calls to some Democratic senators to urge them to oppose the deal , sources say .
Both Rubio and Cruz have had multiple meetings in the last year with Adelson , a sometimes mercurial donor , who gave close to $ 150 m in 2012 to numerous Super Pacs and â€œdark moneyâ€ � non - profits in an attempt to oust Obama and help congressional Republicans .
Boasting strong pro - Israel and hawkish credentials , Rubio and Cruz are said to be near the top of the list of those candidates Adelson is considering backing with his big checkbook , a decision that will probably turn on the candidatesâ€ ™ ideological bona fides coupled with an assessment of their electability .
The topic of Wednesdayâ€ ™ s Cruz - orchestrated rally was broached in a late July meeting in the senatorâ€ ™ s office that drew a couple of dozen conservative groups .
The three event co - sponsors â€ “ the Tea Party Patriots , the Center for Security Policy and the ZOA
â€ “ were in attendance .
Klein , of the ZOA , lauded Cruz for inviting Trump because â€œhis participation substantially increases the publicity and visibility of the Iran nuclear deal , which is a catastropheâ€ � .
This Thursday , as Congress is poised to vote on the deal , Klein will lead a lobbying blitz with some 70 of his board members and donors targeting at least 50 members of Congress , including those who appear undecided and some backers of the accord .
( Klein added that his group would keep pressing Capitol Hill for a resolution that would back Israel and other countries â€œin taking any steps they deem necessary to protect themselves against Tehranâ€ � and other measures . )
Meanwhile , the Conservative Solutions Project , a non - profit group run by allies of Rubio , has featured the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s words and image in its $ 4.5 m anti - nuclear deal ad blitz which has run on cable , radio and the internet .
Jeff Sadosky , a spokesman for the group , said in an email : â€œWeâ€ ™ re prepped to continue advertising throughout the time that Congress is considering the Presidentâ€ ™ s
dangerous Iran treaty.â€ � Adelson has given â€ “ or pledged â€ “ a seven - figure check to the pro - Rubio group , say three sources familiar with the casino mogulâ€ ™ s donations .
The Rubio - allied group , which reported raising almost $ 16 m in the first half of 2015 , isnâ€ ™ t required to publicly disclose its donors under IRS rules .
Sadosky declined to comment on whether Adelson has donated to the project .
Rubio recently said : â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing about this [ Iran agreement ] thatâ€ ™ s binding on the next administration.â€ �
The non - profit American Security Initiative , which was founded earlier this year by former senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota , an Adelson ally , and three other ex - senators , including onetime Democrat Joe Lieberman , has also spent big money fighting the deal .
The group says it has spent almost $ 10 m running hard - hitting ads against the deal â€ “ including a late August blitz aimed at six Democratic senators .
Conservative sources say that the Coleman group has received seven - figure support from Adelson .
Coleman declined comment on its donors , but said in a phone interview that the goal â€œhas been to alert both Members and the American publicâ€ � about what the group deems the dealâ€ ™ s risks .
( Coleman and Adelson are also board members of the Republican Jewish Coalition , a conservative pro - Israel group that receives hefty funding from Adelson and has mounted a lobbying and ad effort against the nuclear accord . )
An Adelson spokesman declined to respond to questions for this piece ."
2015-09-19,"On Saturday , the Texas senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz sought to connect with a Republican establishment crowd â€ “ in part by telling them jokes .
â€œSo now , â€ � he told the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference , â€œthe Democratic field consists of a wild - eyed socialist with ideas that are dangerous for America and the world â€ ¦ and Bernie Sanders.â€
�
The remark elicited laughter .
Jabs at Hillary Clinton aside , Cruz struck a chord with his call to drastically shrink the size of government .
So did John Kasich .
The Ohio governor said : â€œOne of the most important things we have to do in this country is shift the power from Washington back to the states.â€
�
Cruz was first on stage , and more than 2,000 activists and donors looked on as the darling of the Tea Party movement , who has consistently polled in the middle of the 16-strong Republican field , punctuated his remarks with references to the anti - establishment wave riding through the far right of the party .
That wave has placed two non - professional politicians , Donald Trump and Ben Carson , at the top of the polls .
â€œWe are seeing an awakening sweeping this country and let me tell you right now , help is on the way , â€ � Cruz said .
On day one in the White House , Cruz said , he would strike out â€œevery illegal and unconstitutional actionâ€ � taken by President Obama through a series of executive orders used to bypass a Republican - controlled Congress .
â€œPresident Obama likes to say
heâ€ ™ s got a phone and heâ€
™ s got a pen , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œWell , you live by the pen , you die by the pen.â€ �
He added : â€œMy pen has got an eraser.â€ �
The senator shifted to the controversy surrounding Planned Parenthood , saying he would order the Department of Justice to launch an investigation into what he called â€œhorrible videosâ€ � .
The videos , released by an anti - abortion group , allege that the womenâ€ ™ s health organisations profited from the sale of aborted fetal body parts , a claim the organization denies .
Cruz also vowed to end the â€œpersecution of religious libertyâ€ � in the US , and to â€œrip to shredsâ€ � the Iran nuclear deal .
â€œIf this deal goes through , â€ �
he said , â€œthe Obama administration will become quite literally the leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism in the world.â€ �
That is a claim the president denies .
The deal â€ “ negotiated by Iran , the US and five other world powers â€ “ has survived Congressional attempts to block it .
The first day of a Cruz administration would apparently be a busy one .
Cruz said he would immediately set about reforming â€œthe alphabet soup of federal agenciesâ€ �
he said inhibit economic growth .
He would also rein in the Environmental Protection Agency â€œand in the days that follow â€ ¦ pass fundamental tax reformsâ€ � , moving the US to a flat tax .
Calling for the abolition of the IRS , he tried another joke , suggesting that the agencyâ€ ™ s 90,000 employees be moved to the Mexican border .
â€œIf â€ ¦ youâ€ ™ re swimming across the Rio Grande and the first thing you see is 90,000 IRS agents ,
â€ �
Cruz said , â€œyouâ€ ™ d turn around and go home.â€
�
Earlier in the day , Cruz had spoken at the Mackinac school gym , where he ended his remarks in similar fashion .
Though the main conference is typically considered a gathering for establishment Republicans , the senatorâ€ ™ s campaign had a strong presence .
One audience member , Irving Ginsberg , a retired physicist and University of Michigan lecturer , said Cruz has his vote .
He particularly appreciated his remarks about the Iran deal .
â€œThe agreement is a catastrophe , â€ � he said .
Kasich , meanwhile , has enjoyed rising poll numbers following his performance at Wednesdayâ€ ™ s second Republican debate .
He emphasized his experience as a politician , and said : â€œMy mother used to tell me , â€˜Johnny , itâ€ ™ s a sin not to help people who need help , but itâ€ ™ s equally a sin to continue to help people who need to learn how to help themselves.â€ ™ â€ � While Cruz framed his remarks around a vision for the future , Kasich opened with a rundown of his political backstory and , perhaps , an attempt at Cruz - esque humour .
Just one month after beginning classes at Ohio State , he said , he made an appointment to see the university president .
The president informed the 18-year - old Kasich he knew President Richard Nixon .
Unfazed , Kasich asked the president to send a letter to Nixon â€ “ and was rewarded with a trip to the White House .
The long - winded anecdote drew , eventually , to a conclusion : the 20-minute meeting with Nixon was a more memorable achievement than his 18-year stint in the US Congress , Kasich said .
According to a poll from VoterGravity , after Wednesdayâ€ ™ s second debate , Kasich received 9 % support among more than 2,800 New Hampshire Republican primary voters , placing him fourth in the mix .
The former chairman of the House budget committee received praise from several prospective voters on Mackinac Island for his cool demeanor and sense of calm â€ “ an unusual trait in a Republican field led by Donald Trump and his like .
Kasich didnâ€
™ t win over attendee Jerry Clixby , though .
He said : â€œRight now , heâ€ ™ s not on my short list .
â€œIâ€ ™ m looking for someone whoâ€ ™ s a small government guy
, â€ � Clixby said , adding that he wasnâ€ ™ t swayed by Kasichâ€ ™ s call to shift power to state governments .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul and ex - Hewlett - Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina were scheduled to speak on Saturday night ."
2015-09-29,"Ted Cruz was abandoned by his colleagues Monday night in yet another high - stakes showdown over the federal budget .
With a government shutdown looming , the Senate voted strongly to advance a bipartisan spending bill to keep the federal government open by a vote of 77 - 19 .
The Texas Republican then spoke angrily and at times tearfully for an hour to a near - empty Senate chamber , saying that Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell stripped a provision that would cancel federal funding of Planned Parenthood in exchange for keeping the government open .
Afterwards , Cruz spoke to media organisation outside , including the Guardian .
â€œRepublican leadership has abdicated its responsibility to fight for conservative principles , and has handed control of the agenda over to Barack Obama , [ Senate minority leader ] Harry Reid , and [ House minority leader ] Nancy Pelosi , â€ � he said .
He reiterated his accusation that the outgoing Speaker of the House , John Boehner , had â€œprecookedâ€ � an agreement with Democrats to avoid a shutdown of the government and pass a bill that would fund Planned Parenthood .
â€œIt is exactly the legislation that would have passed if Harry Reid were still majority leader , â€ � he said .
McConnell is under fire from tea partiers who have demanded he fight harder against Planned Parenthood even at the risk of a partial government shutdown , but McConnell is more concerned with protecting his 2016 re - election class from political damage if Republicans are blamed for a shutdown .
Last week , Democrats led a filibuster of a Senate stopgap measure that would have defunded Planned Parenthood .
Eight Republicans voted against it , leaving it short of a simple majority , much less the 60 votes required for the bill to advance for a final vote .
The current bill is â€œthe only viable way forward in the short termâ€ � , McConnell said .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t represent my first , second , third or 23rd choice when it comes to funding the government , but it will keep the government open through the fall.â€ �
The Senate is expected to approve the bill Tuesday and send it to the House .
The White House endorsed the measure since it would allow â€œcritical government functions to operate without interruption , providing a short - term bridge to give the Congress time to pass a budget for the remainder of the fiscal yearâ€ � .
The Planned Parenthood fight helped topple Boehner , who announced his resignation last week after informing several conservatives he would not use the must - pass spending measure to take on the group .
The measure would keep the governmentâ€ ™ s doors open through 11 December , but the battle is sure to be rejoined then at a potentially greater risk of a shutdown .
On Monday night , Cruz served notice that he would be a big part of that fight .
The Texas lawmaker assailed his Republican leadership , saying it â€œreflexively surrenders at the outsetâ€ � , while complimenting Democrats for their willingness to â€œcrawl on broken glass with a knife between their teethâ€ � to fight for their policies .
He compared Obama to the â€œTerminatorâ€ � for his tenacity in passing his agenda .
â€œI believe the American people deserve leaders in both houses who are committed to honouring the promises we made to them , â€ �
he told reporters Monday evening .
â€œI do not believe our leadership has been doing that .
Hope springs eternal that leadership might choose to change course.â€
�
On an interview on Sunday on CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation , Boehner hit out at â€œfalse prophetsâ€ � in the Republican party , and pointed to the October 2013 shutdown over Obamacare , which was led by Cruz .
When asked if Cruz was one of the â€œfalse prophetsâ€ � , he said : â€œYou can pick a lot of names out ; Iâ€ ™ ll let you choose them.â€ � Republicans have targeted Planned Parenthood for years , but the release of secretly recorded videos that raised questions about its handling of fetal tissue provided to scientific researchers has outraged anti - abortion Republicans .
The group says it is doing nothing wrong , and isnâ€ ™ t violating federal law ."
2015-10-06,"Conservative mega - donors allied with the sprawling political and fundraising network spearheaded by the billionaire
Koch brothers have already contributed at least $ 20 m to a handful of Super Pacs backing Republican presidential candidates , the Guardian can reveal .
Several prominent Koch network donors have written checks of between $ 100,000 and $ 11 m to the super Pacs â€ “ organizations independent of the candidatesâ€ ™ campaigns which , unlike the campaigns , may raise unlimited amounts of money from individual donors â€ “ backing senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas , as well as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett - Packard CEO who reports over the weekend claimed was being considered for donations from the Kochs themselves .
A number of donors allied with the Kochs also chipped in millions to the Super Pac backing Wisconsinâ€ ™ s governor , Scott Walker , who dropped out of the race last month , sparking a subsequent free - for - all for their allegiance and big checks .
The Koch donor network is a group of over 200 wealthy conservatives overseen by Charles G Koch and David H Koch that meets twice a year at exclusive resorts to discuss small government and free - market policy priorities and raise funds for nonprofits that push their agenda .
Campaign finance reports and interviews with donors and operatives suggest that the powerful donor network , which intends to spend almost $ 900 m on political and advocacy drives this election cycle , remains divided about its presidential choices .
Of the $ 900 m target for total spending in the 2016 election cycle , about $ 300 m is slated to go to political spending , according to published reports .
Two conservative sources say that the network has raised and has commitments for about $ 600 m .
Most of the Koch network spending will be done by nonprofits which , unlike super Pacs , do not have to disclose their donors .
The tens of millions that Koch network donors have already given to Super Pacs supporting
GOP presidential candidates seems to come on top of their other spending goals .
Two of these presidential Super Pacs are run by operatives with ties to nonprofit groups that have been backed by Koch network donors .
Over the summer , Rubio , Bush , Fiorina , Cruz and Walker made presentations at a Koch network fundraising and policy retreat at a posh resort in Dana Point , California , which drew hundreds of wealthy donors including Charles and David Koch .
The brothers , who together are worth almost $ 100bn and control the multinational industrial giant Koch Industries , have suggested they may personally help a few candidates who meet their deregulatory , low - tax and free - market policy priorities .
The summer donor retreat was hosted by Freedom Partners , the Koch networkâ€
™ s fundraising hub that is set up as a business trade group and has over 200 members who donate at least $ 100,000 a year .
Last year , Freedom Partners launched its own Super Pac , Freedom Partners Action Fund , which raised almost $ 29 m and is expected to spend $ 100 m or more in 2016 .
Even before the summer retreat , network donors were coughing up big checks to Super Pacs , which sprang up after the supreme court in 2010 overturned decades of campaign finance law and allowed corporations , individuals and unions to give unlimited sums to ostensibly independent groups promoting federal candidates .
Koch network donors who have contributed to Super Pacs backing Republican presidential candidates in this election cycle include : Arizonan Randy Kendrick , a wealthy conservative who has donated $ 100,000 to a pro - Rubio Super Pac and is also a leading fundraiser for his campaign committee in her home state of Maryland .
Kendrick is a regular attendee at the Kochsâ€ ™ s semiannual retreats .
Ken Griffin , who runs Citadel , a large Chicago hedge fund , and has donated to Koch network projects .
Griffin also chipped in $ 100,000 to the pro - Rubio Super Pac , and $ 100,000 to the pro - Jeb Bush super Pac , Right to Rise USA .
Hedge - fund mogul Robert Mercer , a big donor to the Koch network , who poured $ 11 m into the pro - Cruz Pac , Keep the Promise I , of which $ 500,000 was shipped to the Fiorina - supporting Super Pac , Carly for America .
Helen Schwab , the wife of investor Charles Schwab , a longtime donor to the Koch network , who gave $ 1.5 m to the Jeb Bush - supporting Super Pac , Right to Rise USA .
Other heavy hitters in the Koch network , such as multibillionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson and hedge - fund billionaire Paul Singer , have not yet given to Super Pacs , but have met with top GOP contenders including Rubio , Bush and Fiorina .
Adelson , sources say , gave or pledged a seven - figure check to a Rubio - allied nonprofit that does not have to disclose its donors .
Koch network donors attest to the fundraising muscle that the semiannual network retreats offer .
â€œAnybody who goes to the Koch conferences is willing to put their money where their beliefs are , â€ � said Stan Hubbard , a billionaire broadcaster from Minnesota who has attended a few meetings .
â€œThe Koch meetings are an important audience to go before.â€ � Hubbard , who was an early backer of Walker and chipped in $ 50,000 to a Super Pac backing him called Unintimidated , indicated shortly before Walker pulled out of the race that he was going to give the maximum federal donation of $ 2,700 to the campaigns of Rubio , Fiorina , the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , and Ben Carson .
Asked if he would donate again to a Super Pac , Hubbard said : â€œAnybody who looks like theyâ€ ™ d be a great candidate and is searching for help , weâ€ ™ d certainly consider.â€ �
Another big contributor to Walkerâ€ ™ s Super Pac who has been been a Koch network donor for a few years is Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks .
The founder of ABC Supply Co , Hendricks gave $ 5 m to Walkerâ€ ™ s
Unintimidated Super Pac .
In addition , some of the Super Pacs and campaigns are being run by operatives who have either worked for nonprofits funded by Koch donors or have lobbied for Koch Industries .
For instance , the president of the pro - Cruz Super Pac , Keep the Promise I , is Kellyanne Conway , a GOP pollster who has been a consultant to a few Koch backed advocacy groups including Americans for Prosperity , and attended some Koch donor retreats .
Likewise , the executive director of the Fiorina - supporting Super Pac , Stephen DeMaura , is a Washington operative who recently led Americans for Job Security , a nonprofit which received millions of dollars in the 2012 elections from Koch allied donors .
AJS was embroiled in a California campaign finance scandal that led to a $ 1 m fine against two Arizona groups to which it funneled millions of dollars that were spent on California ballot initiatives without properly disclosing the actual donors .
And Fiorinaâ€ ™ s campaign manager is Frank Sadler , a former lobbyist for Koch Industries .
The Koch network is helping GOP candidates in other ways too .
Americans for Prosperity , which intends to spend over $ 200 m in the coming elections on advocacy and political drives , has hosted a few rallies in key primary states , including New Hampshire and Nevada , where Koch favored candidates including Rubio , Bush and Cruz have been featured guests .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re going to keep inviting favored candidates to key state events , saving the campaigns money and supplying them with made - for - TV exposure , â€ � said a GOP source familiar with Americans for Prosperityâ€ ™ s plans .
Other Koch entities are providing donors with guidance on which candidates might be worth looking at more closely .
Just days before Walker dropped out , Freedom Partners hosted a conference call to update dozens of donors on the status of network plans and the latest appraisals of candidates .
Two donors say that on the call Koch operatives indicated that both Fiorina and Ben Carson were added to their list of viable candidates along with Rubio , Cruz and Bush ."
2015-10-18,"The Texas senator Ted Cruz says the rise of Donald Trump makes him â€œvery optimisticâ€ � the next occupant of the White House will be a conservative â€ “ perhaps himself
â€ “ propelled there by the â€œvolcanic rageâ€ � of voters .
Speaking to NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday , the Republican presidential candidate said : â€œIâ€ ™ m very encouraged [ about ] where we are right now because I think what weâ€ ™ re seeing happening every day is conservatives coalescing behind our campaign .
â€œAnd you know , one of the reasons Iâ€ ™ m very optimistic is ... is you look at the impact of Donald Trump .
I like Donald.â€
�
Trump , a real estate billionaire , leads most polls of the 15-strong Republican field , over Ben Carson , a retired neurosurgeon who also has no experience in elected office .
Carly Fiorina , a former Hewlett - Packard chief executive who has fought one losing campaign for the US Senate , has also shown strongly .
In a Fox News poll on the Republican field this week , Trump led on 24 % , from Carson on 23 % .
Cruz was third with 10 % and Fiorina scored 5 % , enough for sixth place behind Florida senator Marco Rubio ( 9 % ) and former Florida governor Jeb Bush on 8 % .
Notwithstanding the trend for Republican primaries to lurch right before a general election fought in the centre , it is a startling message for a faction - riven party seeking to end eight years of Democratic control of the White House .
Asked by NBC host Chuck Todd what distinguished him from Carson and Trump â€ “ the latter of whom Cruz has not attacked for his many controversial remarks , unlike most of the rest of the field â€ “
the Texas senator said he was different â€œfrom everyone else on that [ debate ]
stageâ€ � .
â€œI think my record is markedly different in terms of actually standing up and taking on the Washington cartel , â€ � he said .
Cruz is a first - term senator who has earned the enmity of many in his own party for the kind of hardline conservatism that saw him play a leading role in the government shutdown of 2013 , a failed attempt to bring down President Obamaâ€ ™ s signature healthcare reform .
His views , however , are shared by voters and elected representatives aligned with the Tea Party movement , which bemoans bipartisan deal - making , the traditional way of getting things done on Capitol Hill .
In his interview with NBC , Cruz attempted to explain why he , a sitting US senator , could appeal to those attracted to â€œoutsidersâ€ � like Carson and Trump .
Conservative voters feel â€œvolcanic rageâ€ � , he said .
â€œPeople are ticked off with politicians â€ ¦ that make great promises on the campaign trail
but then they donâ€
™ t actually follow through.â€
�
Asked if he had followed through on vows to shut down Obamacare and the multinational nuclear deal with Iran â€ “ which both remain standing â€
“ Cruz said : â€œWhat I promised is that I would fight with every breath in my body to stop the out - of - control spending and the debt that is bankrupting our country , to stop Obamacare , to protect our nation .
â€œAnd â€ ¦ all of those are promises that I have honored every single day in the Senate.â€ � Though he declined to make direct attacks on Senate leader Mitch McConnell and outgoing House speaker John Boehner , who recently called conservatives such as Cruz â€œfalse prophetsâ€ � , Cruz spoke with elemental fury about the â€œRepublican leadershipâ€
� .
Such â€œvolcanic rageâ€ � among conservative voters , he said , had produced â€œtidal waveâ€ � and
â€œtsunamiâ€ � elections of Republicans to Congress but had not produced results , leading to the primacy of Trump , Carson and himself .
â€œLeadership voted to fund Obamacare , â€ �
he said .
â€œThen they voted to fund amnesty [ for undocumented migrants ] .
Then they voted to fund Planned Parenthood .
And then Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general .
â€œNow Chuck , which one of those decisions is one iota different than what would happened under [ Senate minority leader ] Harry Reid and the Democrats ?
The truth of the matter is Republican leadership are the most effective Democrat leaders weâ€ ™ ve ever seen.â€ �
After a discussion of foreign policy in which he argued for counterterrorism over large - scale military force and â€œstrong menâ€ � such as Egyptian general and president Abdel Fatah al - Sisi leading Middle Eastern countries , Cruz was asked about the upcoming deadline for raising the US debt limit , another flashpoint for conservatives .
He did not say he was in favor of attaching conditions to approval of a raise , saying : â€œWhat Iâ€ ™ d like to see on the debt limit is Republican leaders fight for something .
For Peteâ€ ™ s sakes , anything.â€ �
Turning his fire back on the other Republican candidates , Cruz concluded : â€œYou know , everyone just filed their fundraising reports .
Out of all 17 Republican candidates who started â€ ¦ the one with the most cash on hand is our campaign , $ 13.8 m .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got $ 3.5 m more in the bank than Jeb Bush .
If Iâ€ ™ d said that six months ago , you would have said I was off - my - rocker insane.â€ �"
2015-10-28,"Three Republican senators running for president have assailed a bipartisan budget deal to avert a government shutdown , with one of them launching an almost certainly futile attempt to block its passage .
Rand Paul vowed to filibuster the agreement , while Marco Rubio dismissed it as â€œseverely flawedâ€ � and Ted Cruz dubbed it as â€œcomplete and utter surrender.â€ � â€œI will do everything I can to stop it , I will filibuster it ,
I will not let them condense the time ,
â€ �
Paul said on Tuesday during a campaign swing in Colorado ahead of the third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday .
â€œI will make sure that the country is aware that really both sides appear to have given up , right and left.â€ �
But despite Paulâ€ ™ s grievances there is little he or any of the other candidates can do to stop the bill in its tracks .
The deadline to raise the debt limit is not until 5 November and the House of Representatives is set to vote on the bill on Wednesday in what outgoing speaker John Boehner said would be a strong bipartisan show of support .
Under the Senate rules , if there are 60 votes in favor of advancing the bill Paulâ€ ™ s only option would be to eat up any debate time by speaking on the floor without pause â€ “ as he has done in high - profile fights over drone strikes and mass surveillance .
But in this case itâ€ ™ s unlikely he would be able to block the bill â€
“ and leadership aides said part of why they planned to move expeditiously was to avoid a scenario in which the budget debate moved into next week , when Paul or other opponents of the deal could actually risk hitting the debt ceiling .
A spokeswoman for Paul did not immediately return a request for comment when asked how , under the current rules , he planned to filibuster .
The senator did not hide his disdain for the accord , which , in addition to extending the debt limit and funding the government through 2017 , raises caps on both defense and domestic spending .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a horrible â€
” itâ€
™ s hard for me to not use profanity in describing it , â€ � Paul said .
Rubio criticized the â€œpolitical establishmentâ€ � for a lack of transparency in reaching a deal he said would â€œirresponsiblyâ€ � raise the debt ceiling without substantive reforms .
â€œWe need to fundamentally reform our entitlement programs for future generations and adopt major economic reforms that would boost growth and help us pay down our debt , â€ �
Rubio said in a statement announcing his opposition to the deal .
â€œThis deal does nothing that future generations of Americans will be proud of us for ; instead , it postpones tough decisions until after the next election.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s office did not return a request for comment when asked if he would join Paul in seeking to delay the vote .
Itâ€ ™ s unclear
if the Florida senator , whose low Senate attendance has been a subject of scrutiny , will return to Washington for the vote .
Rubio is currently scheduled to campaign in Iowa on Friday and Saturday .
Cruz , the conservative firebrand who played a significant part in orchestrating the government shutdown of 2013 , also did not commit to trying any delaying tactics with respect to the budget agreement .
The Texas senatorâ€ ™
s office did not have any details on how Cruz planned to approach the issue , other than to say they were waiting to see what the process would look like for considering the measure in the Senate .
Cruz unleashed sharp criticism on Republican leaders for what he said was â€œa slap in the faceâ€ � to conservatives after the party regained control of Congress in the 2014 midterm elections .
â€œWe now have a GOP Congress but no one watching this budget surrender would know it , â€ �
Cruz said in a statement .
â€œMake no mistake
: the Speakerâ€ ™ s golden parachute is a victory for the Washington Cartel , for the politically connected elite , and for big business and lobbyists who get in bed with career politicians to grow government.â€ �
Both Cruz and Paul have raised significant money â€ “ and elevated their profiles nationally â€ “ through marathon speeches on the Senate floor .
Paul has struggled in the crowded Republican presidential field , raising just $ 2.5 m in the last quarter .
Whether another â€œStand with Randâ€ � moment will help boost his campaign remains to be seen ."
2015-10-28,"The third Republican debate is over .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned : There were tricky questions for Marco Rubio , the senator from Florida , about missing a lot of votes in Congress , for Ted Cruz , the senator from Texas , about his contrarianism ... and one about fantasy football that Chris Christie , the governor of New Jersey , spiked in the end zone .
â€œWe are 19tn in debt , we have Isis and al - Qaeda attacking us , and weâ€ ™ re talking about fantasy football?!â€ � he exclaimed .
Cruz got cheers for attacking the media , successfully turning the crowd against the moderators by saying the quality of the questions was â€œwhy the American people donâ€
™ t trust the mediaâ€ � .
The moderatorsâ€ ™ performance was also decried afterward by Reince Priebus , the national Republican chairman , on Twitter .
The crowd booed one moderator for pressing Ben Carson , the retired pediatric neurosurgeon , on whether his appearance on the web site of a company later accused of false advertising did not reflect badly on his judgment .
Carson said he had nothing to do with the company .
It emerged through fact - checking , however , that Carson had in fact performed in a video for the company .
The episode was representative of an uneven night for the doctor .
Rubio repeatedly turned tricky questions into strong applause lines .
Pressed on having to liquidate a retirement fund even after a $ 1 m book deal , Rubio quipped : â€œAnd I used it to pay off my loans .
And itâ€ ™ s available in paperback!â€ �
Jeb Bush stumbled in trying to attack Rubio for not showing up for work in the Senate , and reverted to flat stump speech - talk when he got a chance to talk about his economic plan .
Donald Trump , the erstwhile frontrunner , turned in an uncharacteristically short - winded performance , denied ever having made a criticism of Rubio that was printed on his website and used his closing statement to brag about having held the debate to two hours instead of three .
Everyone from the audience to the moderators to the candidates to the online audience seemed thankful to Trump for that .
The other four candidates â€ “ former tech CEO Carly Fiorina , Ohio governor John Kasich , Senator Rand Paul and governor Mike Huckabee â€ “ seemed to hold their places without breaking through .
The possible exception was Kasich , who had a couple persuasive moments of exasperation at the â€œfantasyâ€ � plans for entitlements and immigration presented by his rivals .
Searches on Google for the candidates tonight :
Luckily for Jeb !
no Republicans have ever heard of this guy Mike Huckabee was the first one to mention the blimp that came free from its mooring in Maryland today and drifted to Pennsylvania before it was eventually grounded , writes Adam Gabbatt .
â€œIf you saw that blimp that got cut loose in Maryland today , itâ€ ™ s the perfect example of government , â€ � he said .
Unfortunately for Huckabee , his own metaphor had even more in common with the blimp .
Just as the military lost control of its gaseous vessel , Huckabee quickly lost control of his analogy .
Soon his rather hot - aired trope was drifting around without direction or purpose , before eventually flopping to the ground .
â€œWhat we had was something the government made , basically a bag of gas , that got cut loose , destroyed everything in its path , left thousands of people powerless , but they couldnâ€ ™ t get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it.â€
�
He added bafflingly : â€œSo we had to keep it.â€ �
Dominic Rushe and Jana Kasperkevic of the Guardianâ€ ™ s business desk were here to cast their keen eyes over the economic aspects of the debate .
Hereâ€ ™ s what they thought :
Dominic Rushe :
So ... lovely as it is to spend the evening with you Jana , that was a bit crap wasnâ€ ™ t it ?
The main event was better than the kiddie table warm - up and - for such a busy debate - there was some fairly substantive stuff on taxes , on H1-B visas and a few digs at the Fed ( stay with me ) ... but minimum wage ?
No .
Womenâ€ ™ s wages ?
â€œI love my mom , governmentâ€ ™ s bad ,
OK?â€ �
Where was the debate on free trade ?
I miss Trump saying â€œChinaâ€ � .
Pretty lame really for a debate labelled : â€œYour Money ,
Your Vote.â€
�
There were more mentions of â€œmiddle - classâ€ � in the warm - up .
And they should have bumped Lindsey Graham up to first class .
I was surprised that the crowd got so angry given that very few of the questions really struck a nerve .
Jana Kasperkevic :
I , too , missed Lindsey Graham .
You know what else I missed ?
Serious questions about peopleâ€ ™ s money .
There was too much talk about tax plans .
All people want to hear is : â€œI will tax the rich .
I will not tax you .
In fact , I will cut your taxes.â€
�
Anything other than that and peopleâ€ ™ s eyes glaze over .
I know mine did .
Here are the questions CNBC should have asked : Do you think $ 7.25 is high enough for a federal minimum wage ?
Could you survive on about $ 15,000 a year ?
Do you know the average age of a minimum wage worker in America ?
Nine of the candidates on that stage are millionaires .
Ask them : what do you think you and other millionaires should be paying in taxes ?
Ask candidates with children like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz - are you worried about paying for your kidsâ€ ™ college ?
How will you do it ?
Ask Carly Fiorina how it felt to be one of the first female CEO ?
What advice would she give to average American women about asking for a raise ?
After all , in 2014 , US women earned 79 cents for every dollar that men did .
And why not ask Fiorina about the 30,000 people she laid off at HP ?
Does she ever think about them ?
The chairman of the Republican National Committee is not happy with the proceedings this evening .
The candidates blasted the moderators for asking questions they said were irrelevant or petty or antagonistic .
It was the Republicansâ€ ™ big night , but it was Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s name we kept hearing , reports Lauren Gambino , who is on the campaign trail with the Democratic frontrunner in Bartlett , New Hampshire .
While the top 10 polling Republicans take center stage in Boulder , the Democratic frontrunner is watching the debate â€ “ and live texting her reactions â€ “ from somewhere * in New Hampshire .
* She was asked several times by journalists at two events where she was watching the debate and did not answer .
Itâ€ ™ s possible too
that she couldnâ€ ™ t
hear the question amid the adoring throngs , but not likely , leaving us to wonder â€ ¦ where in the Granite State is Hillary Clinton tweeting from ?
Her first text of the night : â€œHillary here .
Iâ€ ™ m here in New Hampshire watching the GOP debate
- how about you?â€ �
Earlier in the evening , Clinton described the third Republican debate as â€œa little scaryâ€ � and said she â€œfeels
sorryâ€
� for her GOP counterparts .
During a speech at the partyâ€ ™ s Annual Grover Cleveland Dinner in Bartlett â€ “ where Clevelandâ€ ™ s grandson
George impersonating his presidential ancestor introduced Clinton â€ “
she joked : â€œFor those of you masochistic enough to want to watch weâ€ ™ ll try to get you outâ€
� of the event in time .
Clinton carried on the joke , saying that the Republican debates are actually a lot like a â€œreality TV show , but the cast of characters are out of touch with actual realityâ€ � .
The room roared with laughter .
She also said she felt bad for Republicans , who attacked her â€œwhen in doubt , when they have nothing else to say , when they donâ€ ™ t want to take any responsible actionâ€ � .
Meanwhile , residents in the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa are hearing Clintonâ€ ™ s voice coming out of the television , too .
The Clinton campaign began airing a series of issue - based television ads featuring working women .
Though Clinton does not appear in the ads , she does the voice over .
So far weâ€ ™ ve seen a commercial about Sarah , the senior business analysts , Alexis , the financial programming associate , Mindy , the cardiac nurse and Cheryl , the Kindergarten teacher .
Oh , and her team is rapidly working to respond to attacks over immigration , taxes , social security and Medicare , the economy , healthcare , LGBT equality , equal pay , affordable college , gun safety , criminal justice , raising the minimum wage and climate change .
Wherever she is , sheâ€ ™ s keeping busy .
Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s campaign is angry at CNBC , according to a Politico report , which witnesses a backstage spat .
Jeb Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz got into a heated confrontation with a CNBC producer outside the debate as it was happening , according to two sources familiar with the incident .
Closing statements .
Paul :
I want small government .
The budget deal this week is terrible .
Iâ€ ™ m going to filibuster it tomorrow .
Enoughâ€ ™ s enough .
Christie : Speaking to camera .
Are you fed up with Washington ?
Are you concerned about the debt ?
Are you serious about it ?
Then elect someone whoâ€ ™ s â€œdeadly serious about changing this culture.â€ � Chris Christie for clean government .
Cruz :
Who up here has actually taken on Washington ?
I have .
My dad fled oppression .
Freedom is personal for me .
Fiorina :
Every election we hear talk and intentions .
â€œWhat we need now is a proven leader who has produced results .
Thatâ€ ™ s how you go from secretary to CEO.â€ � â€œI
am Hillary Clintonâ€
™ s
worst nightmare .
In your heart of hearts you can not wait to see a debate between [ me ] and HRC.â€ � Carson : I want to thank my colleagues and the audience â€œfor being attentive and noticing the questions and noticing the answers.â€
�
People are waking up .
Political correctness stinks .
Trump :
Our country doesnâ€
™ t win anymore .
We used to .
We lose on trade , we lose with Isis .
With Iran .
We donâ€ ™ t win .
These folks , CNBC .
$ 250,000 for a 30-second ad .
Nobody wants to stand up here for 3.5 hours .
They lost a lot of money .
Everybody said it was going to be 3.5 hours .
And after two minutes .
I renegotiated it down to two hours
so we can get the hell out of here .
Rubio :
America is great .
I love it .
Itâ€ ™ s special .
But itâ€ ™ s slipping away .
Leaders are out of touch .
Letâ€ ™ s expand the American dream .
Vote Rubio .
Bush : Americaâ€ ™ s at a crossroads .
I will change the culture in Washington .
Just as I changed [ cough ] the culture in Tallahassee .
We rule .
Thank you .
Huckabee :
To the media this is a game and weâ€ ™ re the players .
But we give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people .
â€œFor those of us who are serious enough to run for president , think long and hard about why weâ€ ™ re here ...
weâ€
™ re not here for ourselves.â€ � Kasich : If youâ€ ™ ve saved one life , youâ€ ™ ve changed the world .
We need to rebuild families .
We need to know our neighbors .
America is great from the bottom up and the bottom up is us .
We will renew America .
God Bless America .
Applause .
Thatâ€ ™ s it .
Checkered flag .
Roger Stone is the longtime Republican political operative and former adviser , this cycle , to Donald Trump .
He accuses Kasich of dealing pot in the 1970s .
The story feels pretty iffy â€ “ not that Kasich sold pot , but that Stone fired him for it in 1976
Itâ€ ™ s Royals 4 , Mets 1 , in the bottom of the 6th .
You can catch up over on our World Series live blog here .
Oh wait the debate is back .
Chris Christie = Allen Iverson .
â€œIâ€
™ m supposed to be a franchised player , and we in here talking about practice .
Not a game!â€ �
Commercial break with closing statements coming up â€ “ so whoâ€ ™ s winning ?
Itâ€ ™ s dawning on us that some of you out there have lost the feeling of jaunty adventure normally associated with national presidential debates .
Letâ€ ™ s talk about that ?
Bush is asked about betting on fantasy sports .
Isnâ€ ™ t that gambling ?
â€œWell first of all , Iâ€ ™ m 7 - 0 in my fantasy football league , â€ � he says .
But he says it has to be looked at it .
â€œThere has to be some regulation , if they canâ€ ™ t regulate it themselves , the NFL has to look at it.â€ �
Christie strikes with a big applause line , figuratively pulling out his hair that with the urgent crises facing the county the debate has turned to fantasy football .
We are 19tn in debt , we have Isis and al - Qaeda attacking us , and weâ€ ™ re talking about fantasy football ? !
Harwood , the moderator , talks over Christie in asking a new question , about renewable energy .
â€œJohn do you want me to answer or do you want to answer ?
Because Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , even in New Jersey what youâ€ ™ re doing is rude , â€ � Christie says .
More applause .
The crowd is against these moderators .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund , live in the â€œstand your groundâ€ � state of Florida : You know that your campaign is really reaching for anything at the point at which you pledge that , as president , youâ€ ™ ll make sure that Americaâ€ ™ s cops will no longer feel unsafe when they get out of their cars .
Chris Christie is going to # 8 with a bullet .
( I actually donâ€
™
t know where Christie is currently ranked .
I canâ€
™ t think that helped . )
Kasich is asked about student debt .
He says that in Ohio , universities will not get paid under a new plan until students complete courses .
He says there are other revenue streams for universities .
He uses the word â€œdisintermediate.â€ �
He arrives at a policy proposal .
Public service to pay off student debt .
â€œThis is a big moral issue for America , living a life bigger than yourself.â€
�
Bush says that government should not get involved in student loans because it would blow up the debt .
Fiorina says â€œthe more the government gets engaged in the economy , the slower the economy becomes.â€ �
She mentions minimum wage laws .
From Guardian US columnist Cindy Casares : Marco Rubio just said : â€œOur immigration system , from now on , needs to be merit - based unlike how it was when my parents got in.â€ �
Ok , maybe Iâ€ ™ m paraphrasing , but thatâ€ ™ s practically
what he just said with a straight face .
That canâ€ ™ t have been easy .
Christie says crime is going up because the president does not support police .
The number one job of the president ... is to protect the safety and security of the American people .
This president has failed .
Actually itâ€ ™ s to uphold the constitution .
Whatever the case , Christie says he would do better .
Much more substance in the â€œgrown - upâ€ � debate , writes Dominic Rushe .
There was almost a serious debate about visas and in particular the H-1B visas , given to skilled tech workers from abroad , that Silicon Valley is lobbying so hard to have increased .
There is some compelling evidence that H-1B visas , loved by Mark Zuckerberg et al , are a scam .
This study from the Economic Policy Institute found the top 10 users of H-1Bâ€ ™ s were all offshore outsourcing firms .
â€œThere are two reasons these firms hire H-1Bs instead of Americans : 1 ) an H-1B worker can legally be paid less than a U.S. worker in the same occupation and locality ; and 2 ) the H-1B worker learns the job and then rotates back to the home country and takes the work with him ,
â€ � according to the report .
Zuckerberg - backed lobby FWD.US has been pushing for an increase , supported by Rubio .
And Trump has been highly critical of the scheme - but not tonight .
Trump has called for employers to pay H-1B workers much more money in an attempt to discourage companies and boost job prospects for Americans .
He also wants tech jobs offered to unemployed Americans before workers with H-1B visas â€œThis will improve the number of black , Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program .
Mark Zuckerbergâ€ ™ s personal Senator , Marco Rubio , has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities , â€ �
Trump wrote in his immigration plan in August .
Tonight he had no problem with Zuck !
Interesting .
Heâ€
™ s prepared to take on CNBC , even Fox , but not Facebook .
Huckabee is asked whether Trump has the moral authority to unite the country .
Huckabee says he loves Donald Trump , â€œheâ€ ™ s a good man.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m wearing a Donald Trump tie tonight , get over that one.â€
�
Is it made in Mexico ?
Kasich asks .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s a nasty question , â€ �
Trump says , apparently in reference to the original question but perhaps to the Mexico question .
Trump is asked about his concealed carry permit and whether he would be more comfortable if his employees could carry at work .
â€œYes
I might feel more comfortable .
I have a permit , which is very unusual in New York , to carry .
And sometimes I carry .
Not a lot .
But I like to be unpredictable.â€ �
Laugh and applause .
Ha ha . ha .
Trump says he would change policies at Trump resorts to allow guns .
Theyâ€ ™ re back .
CNBC hits Trump with a fact check for his denying he called Rubio Zuckerbergâ€ ™ s senator .
Itâ€ ™ s on your web site !
Quick of CNBC points out .
Trump says however people come in they have to come in legally .
Rubio takes the question .
He says that immigrants must â€œcome here to be an American .
Not just be in America.â€ �
Commercial break .
How much time is left ?
20 minutes ?
Whoâ€ ™ s winning ?
Tell us whoâ€ ™ s winning !
Pot question for Kasich .
Legalize it ?
â€œSending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster , â€ � he says .
Then Kasich switches back to income inequality and makes a call for freezing all regulations for a year except for on public safety , cutting taxes , balancing the budget and sending federal programs back to the states .
â€œAnd that will get to the nub of opportunity for children and an ability to see wages
rise.â€ � â€œYou want to fix America ?
This is the formula .
It worked for Reagan , and it worked for our team in Ohio.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s a rather rousing speech , but does not seem to get much applause in the room .
Weâ€ ™ re on to Rubioâ€ ™ s tax plan .
The Tax Foundation has scored Rubioâ€ ™ s plan as saying that incomes for top earners would go up 29 % while middle incomes would rise 15 % , Harwood says .
Rubio starts talking really fast and brings up his dry cleaner .
He basically accuses Harwood of making up the Tax Foundation scoring .
Rand Paul cuts in , laboriously .
He has a rather difficult time getting the microphone but he manages .
He says he gets rid of the payroll tax .
( Paul supports a 14.5 % flat tax except for the lowest earners pay 0 . )
Theyâ€ ™ re all trying to jump in with their memorable tax plans .
The stand - out moment from tonightâ€ ™ s debate so far , asks Adam Gabbatt?Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s promise to give a â€œwarm kissâ€ � to a Democrat capable of cutting spending .
The image of Bushâ€ ™ s soft , puckered lips slowly moving towards a political rival , the light of an open fire dancing upon their entwined bodies , has captured the mood of the nation .
Or at least it has disgusted some people on Twitter .
By the way , do not google warm kiss .
That is not the kind of warm kiss Bush was referring to .
If you were following the runaway blimp story of earlier today -- that just came up .
It was pretty good .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund : â€œThe Democrats have the ultimate Super Pac , itâ€ ™ s called the mainstream media.â€ �
Marco Rubio was doing some kindergarten - level trolling , especially after Ted Cruz already demonized the moderators as biased attack dogs in the middle of a debate ... where Tea Party inspiration Rick Santelli is asking questions .
Paul takes a question about the Fed .
â€œWe shouldnâ€ ™ t have price controls on the price of money , â€ � he says .
Carson takes a question about support he had voiced for oil subsides .
â€œI was wrong about taking the oil subsidy , â€ � he says .
He says he studied it and changed his mind .
â€œThe best policy is to get rid of all subsidy , and get government out of our lives , â€ � he says .
Then Carson says â€œthis is a bunch of crapâ€ �
â€ “
did he say that ?
He kind of swallowed the line .
Not characteristic speech from the good doctor .
From Guardian US columnist Cindy Casares : Ted Cruz opened up to let us know that his father Rafael â€ “ an outspoken , staunchly conservative fundamental Christian who often passes judgment on everyone else
â€ “ was once a deadbeat dad .
Turns out he was also a drunk .
Thank God Rafael found Jesus so he could lead Ted to Washington and now we get two Senators for the price of one .
Becky Quick , the moderator , asks Trump about calling Rubio â€œMark Zuckerbergâ€ ™ s personal senator.â€ �
Trump says , I never have called him any such thing , this is another lie by the lying media liars .
But : Trump gets in his much - anticipated hit on Super Pacs .
â€œIâ€ ™ m the only person in either campaign
thatâ€ ™ s self - funding , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI will be putting up , you know , tremendous amounts of money .
Super pacs are a disaster , theyâ€ ™ re a scam ... and Iâ€ ™ m not blaming these folks , but , I guess I do.â€
�
Then Trump refers to â€œall of these nasty and ridiculous questions.â€ �
Rubio jumps in .
â€œDemocrats have the ultimate super Pac .
Itâ€ ™ s called the mainstream media.â€
�
Then he talks about Clintonâ€ ™ s appearance before the Benghazi committee , calling it damning -- for Clinton .
â€œIt was the week she got exposed as a liar .
But she has her Super Pac helping her out .
The American mainstream media.â€ �
Media really taking it on the chin tonight .
From Guardian US columnist Jessica Valenti : It was disappointing to see Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina pivot from giving real answers to questions about their views on equal pay .
Cruzâ€ ™
s answer was basically just listing a bunch of women in his life
â€
“
we get it , some of your best friends are women .
Fiorina went after Clinton , claiming that â€œever single policy she espouses has been demonstrably bad for women.â€ �
Come on .
( Also , letâ€ ™ s talk about how bad being anti - choice is for women and their familyâ€ ™ s economics . )
And it looks like Fiorina is back on the train to Fibs - ville again :
No , women didnâ€ ™ t lose 92 % of the jobs lost under Obama .
Rubio is asked about his support for expanded H1-B visas for skilled immigrants .
Rubio says American workers should have the first shot at jobs and America should train more high - skilled workers â€œso we donâ€
™ t have to rely on people abroad.â€
�
Jeb Bush finally threw down the gauntlet at his former protege Marco Rubio tonight , but his efforts to attack the Florida senator may have backfired , reports Sabrina Siddiqui , who has followed Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign closely .
Bush interjected as Rubio tried to explain away his low attendance record in the Senate , on the same day one of the largest newspapers in their home state of Florida called on Rubio to resign his seat .
Rubio recalled how several presidential candidates before him had missed a large percentage of their votes - including Barack Obama and John Kerry - and yet the same paper , the Florida Sun Sentinel , endorsed them for president .
â€œI read the editorial with great amusement , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThis is another example of the double standard that exists in this country , between the mainstream media and the conservatives.â€ �
The crowd erupted in applause --
only thatâ€ ™ s where Bush stepped in , speaking as a resident of Florida and thus one of the senatorâ€ ™ s constituents .
â€œI expected he would do constituent service , which means he shows up to work , â€ � said Bush , while seeking to disprove Rubioâ€ ™ s theory of bias by pointing out the paper had endorsed his 2010 Senate bid .
â€œWhen you signed up for this , this is a six - year term .
You should be showing up to work , â€ � Bush said .
â€œLiterally , the Senate , is it a French work week ?
You get three days to show up .
â€œJust resign and let somebody else take the job .
There are a lot of people who are living paycheck to paycheck in Florida.â€ �
But Rubio was ready , having clearly prepared for the moment in the wake of increasingly aggressive barbs from Team Jeb leading up to the debate .
â€œSomeone convinced you attacking me is going to help you , â€ �
Rubio told his former ally , before pivoting to his optimistic campaign message .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s the bottom line : my campaign will continue to be about the future of America .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to attack anyone else on stage .
I will continue to have tremendous admiration for Governor Bush .
Iâ€ ™ m not running against anyone on the stage .
Iâ€ ™ m running for president , because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton.â€
�
Bush and Rubio are competing for the mantle of the more mainstream , electable Republican candidate .
The two are also courting similar donors , and Bushâ€ ™ s inability to gain traction poses a risk that he may lose financial backers to Rubio .
Rubio has only slightly risen in the polls over the last month , but his aides have been optimistic that his well - received debate performances will help boost his profile - and persuade Bush donors to eye their younger , insurgent campaign .
Carson is asked about his affiliation with Mannatech , a medical supplement maker accused of false advertising .
He says he never had anything to do with the company and he canâ€ ™ t help it if they used his image on their web site .
Quintanilla pushes him : But does it not speak to your judgment that your image appeared on this discredited site ?
The moderator is booed .
But Carson was involved with the company : Carson is asked about his role on the corporate board of Costco , which is gay - friendly , in some rankings .
Given his views on homosexuality .
Carson says â€˜you must not understand my views on homosexuality.â€ ™
He says the Constitution protects everybody .
The he says his views on same - sex marriage are not the same as his views on homosexuality .
â€œThey should not automatically assume that because you believe in marriage between a man and a woman , that you are a homophobe.â€ �
From Guardian US columnist and Marco Rubio constituent Jeb Lund , live in Tampa , Florida :
CNBC reporter Becky Quick going in on Rubioâ€ ™
s using Florida Republican party credit cards and defaulting on a mortgage is the first time
Iâ€ ™ ve heard this brought up in a debate and a mainstream forum like this .
Naturally , he dismissed the issues as â€œdiscreditedâ€ � â€ “ which is a good reply if today is Opposite Day .
Cruz says â€œweâ€ ™ ve got to turn the economy around for people who are struggling.â€ �
Then he delivers a somewhat surprising lecture on the struggles of single moms .
â€œYou look at working women .
There are a lot of single moms in my family .
My sister .
Both of my aunts .
My mom was a single mom [ for a while ] ...
thank God my father was invited to a Bible study .
â€œThe struggle of single moms is extraordinary.â€ � Kasich strikes out at this weekâ€ ™ s budget deal .
â€œThis is the same old stuff since I left .
You spend the money today , hoping youâ€ ™ ll save it tomorrow .
â€œIf you really want to get to a balanced budget , you need to reduce your expenses , and you need to grow your economy.â€ �
Doesnâ€ ™ t sound like rocket science on TV .
Rubio is asked about having liquidated a $ 68,000 retirement fund and taking out a second mortgage on his house .
How can he be trusted with the national budget ?
He says thatâ€ ™ s a list of discredited attacks from his Democratic opponents .
Then he talks about growing up without money .
â€œBut Iâ€ ™ m not worried about my finances , Iâ€ ™ m worried about the countryâ€ ™ s finances.â€ � Follow - up question :
But you got a $ 1 m book deal .
Rubio :
â€œAnd I used it to pay off my loans .
And itâ€ ™ s available in paperback!â€ � Applause .
Heâ€ ™ s pressed on liquidating his retirement after a book deal like that .
He says heâ€ ™ s raising a family in the 21st century .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t learn about this by reading about it , â€ � he says .
Laid down some significant relatability ground there , perhaps .
Fiorina is asked about ... something she ignores , to talk about creeping socialism .
â€œYou see folks , this is how socialism starts .
Government causes a problem , and then government steps in to solve the problem .
This is why , folks , we have to take our government back .
â€œBig government favors the big , the powerful , wealthy and well - connected and crushes the small and powerless.â€ �
Sheâ€ ™ s applauded .
From Guardian US columnist Cindy Casares in Austin , Texas : CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla confronted Florida senator Marco Rubio about the cognitive dissonance between his Cuban immigrant heritage and his partyâ€ ™ s anti - Latino immigrant stance .
Rubio has gone from co - sponsoring a bill to create sweeping immigration reform two years ago to co - sponsoring a bill to crack down on so - called sanctuary cities this month .
Now nobody trusts him .
Oh , Marco .
His first response â€ “ to reform immigration policy â€
“ was the genuine one .
Now heâ€ ™ s only doing what he thinks that he has to do to get his old school Cuban Republican community to like him .
But he shouldnâ€ ™ t worry about what a bunch of old hypocrites think .
Rubio could be at the head of the new generation of Cuban leaders if heâ€ ™ d only do what he knows in his heart is right .
Bush takes a question about the budget deal .
He reverts to his laundry list about US economic performance .
â€œI actually have a recordâ€ � in Florida , he says .
A triple - A debt rating .
Economic growth and job creation .
He ends on a strangely vivid note : â€œYou find me a Democrat that would cut spending $ 10 , Iâ€ ™ ll give them a warm kiss.â€
�
Christie takes a question about no one at General Motors going to jail for faulty ignition switches that caused fatalities .
Christie says he would have prosecuted .
The problem with the Obama administration , he says , is â€œitâ€ ™ s a political justice department.â€ �
He claims justice went after David Petraeus , as an example .
Who is now in prison .
Oh wait .
From Guardian US opinion editor Megan Carpentier : Texas Senator Ted Cruz learned the hard way that playing to the audience in the house might not play well with the debate moderators , when he used his time on a substantive question about his economic policies â€ “ particularly on the debt limit â€ “ to insult the CNBC reporters asking some hard - hitting questions of all the candidates .
Cruz â€ “ who eventually got 30 seconds to answer the question â€ “ decided to use his initial time to earn kudos from the audience for noting that â€œnoneâ€ � of the members of the media moderating the debate would be voting in the Republican primary and
so , he alleged , they should be nicer to the candidates .
( In fairness to Cruz , the debate â€ “ which started off with a pro - forma interview question about each candidateâ€ ™ s weakness , turned heated quickly as moderators sought to contrast candidatesâ€ ™ positions with economic realities and actual , you know , math . )
But while Cruz earned a round of applause from an audience that is , by now , completely accustomed to Republicans shrieking about the mainstream mediaâ€ ™ s liberal bias , to viewers at home , asking Carson to explain how heâ€ ™ d plug the deficit by converting all taxes to tithes and then following up when he couldnâ€ ™ t answer the question is supposed to be a debate moderatorâ€ ™ s job .
Theyâ€ ™ re not running for best promise - maker , theyâ€ ™ re running for president .
And a little realism in the Republican race is better for Republicans than itâ€ ™ ll be for Democrats .
Carson is asked about pharmaceutical companies profiteering from charging too much for drugs .
Carson says some companies have abused their positions .
â€œWe have to think about ... what can we do for the average Americans ? ..
The average small manufacturer , if they have less than 50 employees , the average cost in terms of regulations is $ 34,000 per employee .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have to have a major reduction in regulatory influence.â€
�
So he answers the question about profiteering with a call to erase regulation .
Trump is asked about the bankruptcies of his Atlantic City casinos .
He says he used it to his advantage but never personally filed for bankruptcy .
â€œCame out
great ...
thatâ€
™ s what I could do for the country . ...
Boy am I good at solving debt problems .
Nobody could solve it like me.â€ �
Thereâ€ ™ s a Democrat out there watching -- and liking what he sees : Big moments so far weâ€ ™
d say from Cruz and Rubio .
Carson and Bush kind of wavering .
Trump amazingly silent - ish .
Commercial break .
Bracing policy conversation breaking out tonight in Boulder !
Whoâ€ ™ s winning do you think ?
Cruz offers to buy Quintanilla , the moderator , â€œsome famous Colorado brownies.â€
�
Then Cruz says the budget deal is symptomatic of whatâ€ ™ s wrong with Washington .
Then he calls for raising the retirement age for social security and privatizing a portion of it for younger workers .
Huckabee is going to have the last word before break .
â€œThe government has no business stealing more from people who have paid this in , â€ � he says .
Among these Republicans , by reputation budget hawks , which has dared to take a hint of a swing at entitlements ?
Christie is known for talking tough on entitlements .
IF thatâ€ ™ s tough ...
Christie finally gets to speak .
He gets a question about his pitch to raise the retirement age for social security and cutting benefits for some well - off seniors .
Christie turns to the camera .
â€œThe government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.â€ �
He says social security faces insolvency in 7 - 8 years .
He says too much federal spending -- 70%-- is on entitlements and debt servicing .
Then he attacks Clinton , the only one really to do so by name .
â€œIf someoneâ€ ™ s already stolen money from you , are you going to give them more?â€ �
Lots of candidates on stage tonight .
10 .
And not all have spoken yet .
After 50 minutes .
Finally , Number 10 .
He says that entitlements amount to stealing from paychecks .
What is this payroll tax .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like a 400 pound man saying , Iâ€ ™ m going to go on a diet , but Iâ€ ™ m going to eat a sack of Krispy Kremes before I doâ€ � .
Krispy Kremes are donuts .
The World Series is 0 - 0 in the bottom of the third .
Jana Kasperkevic examines Fiorinaâ€ ™ s corporate record : Earlier , Carly Fiorina was questioned about her boast that billionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins was a supporter .
He has some interesting views on democracy , notes Dominic Rushe .
â€œThe Tom Perkins system is : You donâ€ ™ t get to vote unless you pay a dollar of taxes , â€ �
Perkins said last year .
â€œBut what I really think is , it should be like a corporation .
You pay a million dollars in taxes , you get a million votes .
Howâ€ ™
s
that?â€ �
Paul is asked why he opposes the budget deal .
Paul says itâ€ ™ s taking money from entitlements to spend on the military and domestic spending .
He says that the debt limit â€œshould be leveraged to try to reform government.â€ � â€œWe should use the debt ceiling to force upon them budget reform , â€ � he says .
Cruz is asked about his opposition to the budget deal .
Cruz says , your questions stink , and they indicate why the American people do not trust the media .
Applause line .
Then Cruz pops off with a rather brilliant series of caricatures of the questions so far for various candidates .
He says in contrast , the Democrats were asked â€œwhich of you is more handsome and wise?â€ �
Cruz says Republicans are better than Democrats .
Jeb Bush has on his debating boots , it seems : Fiorina takes a question about how terribly Hewlett - Packard stock did during her tenure as CEO .
Why should she be hired now ?
Fiorina rolls out her usual defense , about how badly the NASDAQ did while she was running HP .
Something tells us that old argument is not going to perform well , this tenth or twelfth time
sheâ€ ™ s
tried it .
Bush is asked about troubles with his campaign .
He kind of rolls into a boring laundry list of statistics about the countryâ€ ™ s economic challenges .
He tries to hit applause lines but the crowd does not seem to be with him .
First blood to John Kasich in what was a fairly substantial exchange on taxes , adds US business editor Dominic Rushe .
Enough to make Donald Trump go for his throat , so it must have worked .
Kasich has been very strong on the - cough - somewhat odd tax plans of the candidates , especially Trump and Ben Carson .
Carsonâ€ ™ s plan seems to be something to do with a 10 % tithe , although tonight that has swollen to 15 % .
As moderator Betty Quick said such a scheme would require a 40 % cut in government spending : â€œIâ€ ™ ve done the math.â€ �
Carson was very unconvincing .
Itâ€ ™ s not enough , Kasich said , to say : â€œWhy
donâ€ ™ t we just give chicken in
every potâ€ �
or say we â€œare just going to be great.â€
�
Rubio says a Florida Sun - Sentinel editorial hitting out at him for missing Senate votes was unfair .
He lists other candidates - Kerry , Obama - who missed as many votes but got the paperâ€ ™ s endorsement , and attacks the â€œmainstream mediaâ€ � for bias .
Applause for Rubio .
Bush jumps in to hit Rubio on his absenteeism .
â€œMarco , when you signed up for thisâ€ � - in the Senate - â€œwhat is it , like a French work week?â€ � Rubio :
â€œItâ€ ™ s interesting , in the last six weeks I listened to Jeb , saying that he was going to model his campaign after John McCain.â€ �
McCain missed a lot of votes , Rubio says .
Bush did not have a problem with it then .
More applause for Rubio .
None for Bush .
The first real Rubio - on - Bush fireworks .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund : John Kasichâ€ ™ s appeal in this debate â€ “ â€œFolks , we got ta wake
up!â€
� â€ “ seems geared to both independents and to the Republican establishment .
His direct message here might as well be , â€œLetâ€ ™
s cut the BSâ€ � : defending Medicare and social security ; slamming Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s fantasy tithing tax ; slamming Trumpâ€ ™ s vague calls for greatness .
Kasich is taking the role of the pragmatic conservative that Jeb Bush canâ€ ™ t avoid being , but heâ€ ™ s doing it with an edge and energy that Bush constitutionally lacks and has been skittering away from as he tries to portray himself as a radical conservative during the primary .
Thereâ€ ™ s a virtue in polling toward the bottom , as Kasich is : it gives him the luxury of making being a conventional conservative sound like an edgy outlier position .
Mike Huckabee
couldnâ€ ™ t think of any weaknesses he had right now , Adam Gabbatt notes .
He has a pretty glaring one though : his habit of doing and saying wrong things : a )
When he threw his support behind Kim Davis , the Kentucky county clerk who refused to marry gay couples .
b )
The time he said : â€œI trust @BernieSanders with my tax dollars like I trust a North Korean chef with my labrador !
# DemDebateâ€ � .
c )
The time he said homosexuality was part of a lifestyle , like drinking and swearing .
d )
When he kept claiming Barack Obama grew up in Kenya .
e )
When he said , following the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting , that the removal of God from schools meant they had become â€œa place of carnageâ€ � .
Rubio takes a question about all the votes heâ€ ™ s skipping .
â€œWhy
donâ€
™ t you slow down?â€
�
â€œThatâ€ ™ s an interesting question , â€ � he says .
â€œThatâ€
™ s exactly what the Republican establishment says too .
Why donâ€ ™ t you wait in line .
â€œWait for what?â€
�
Fiorina is up now .
She says Washington has been talking about tax reform forever but never pulls it off .
She says the 70,000 page tax code could be reduced to three pages .
She makes a persuasive argument about the ability of the rich to hire an â€œarmy of lawyersâ€ � to decipher a more complex code .
So a complex code equates with cheating , in her view .
Carson jumps in .
He rejoins the debate with Quick about whether a flat tax of 15 % would fund the government .
He presents some sketchy back - of the envelope math based on the ability to multiply 18 by .15 .
Cruz is not going for a 0 % flat tax â€ “ itâ€ ™ s 10 % .
It adds up , he says .
He claims the CBO has scored â€œevery one of our plans.â€ �
What plans ?
Most candidates have not floated specific proposals on most tax policy .
Cruz says he just released his .
Trump smashes Kasich .
He says that he got lucky in Ohio because of fracking , that he was on the board of Lehman Brothers , and that his poll numbers have tanked â€œand
thatâ€
™ s why heâ€ ™ s on the end.â€ �
Kasich says that yes , Ohio has an energy industry , and that heâ€ ™ s â€œproudâ€ � of his time as a banker .
Kasich pipes up .
He says heâ€ ™ s actually balanced the federal budget .
True , as the former chair of the budget committee .
He accuses his opponents of â€œfantasy tax schemes.â€
�
This stuff is fantasy , just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid .
Come on , you donâ€ ™ t scare senior citizens like that .
Then he has a â€œmad as hellâ€ � moment .
You have a 10 % tithe and thatâ€ ™ s how you fix government ?
Or that weâ€ ™ re just going to be great ?
Or that we are going to move 10 m people out of the country ? !
Folks , weâ€ ™ ve got to wake up !
We got to elect someone who knows how to do the job !
Carson takes a question about his flat tax , of 10 - 15 % ( he hasnâ€ ™ t said how much ) .
How did he come up with that number ?
Carson says he did not say the rate would be 10 % , it would be 15 % .
And he suggests getting rid of all the deductions and loopholes , and doing â€œsome strategic cuttingâ€ � in federal agencies .
Carsonâ€ ™ s magic number is 645 .
The number of federal agencies .
He says the number over and over .
Quick says youâ€ ™ d have to cut government by 40 % to make his tax plan work .
Carson says thatâ€ ™ s not true .
Quick says it is .
Carson says itâ€ ™ s not .
Now thatâ€ ™ s a debate !
Q for Trump .
Youâ€ ™ ve made many big promises .
Letâ€ ™ s be honest .
Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign ?
Trump :
No , and thatâ€ ™ s not a nice way to ask that question .
He says his plan brings tax rates down to 15 % , which is true for most middle - income households , though his top tax bracket is 35 % .
Then Trump riffs on building a wall , â€œand Mexico is gon na pay.â€ �
Harwood cuts off Trump .
He says Trump can not cut taxes as much as he wants without blowing up the deficit .
Bush jumps in .
Quick jumps in .
This thing is a disorganized mess so far .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund , deep in the American heartland / swing state of Florida :
This CNBC intro rephrased : â€œWhich one of these Republicans must we elect to rescue the United States?â€ �
First question : Whatâ€ ™ s your biggest weakness ?
Kasich goes first .
He ignores the question and says he fears the party will nominate someone not up for the job .
He mentions
Carsonâ€ ™ s proposal to end Medicare and Trumpâ€ ™ s to deport undocumented migrants .
Not realistic , he says .
Huckabee says he doesnâ€ ™ t have a weakness .
But if he did it might be that he plays by the rules .
Which Washington does not .
Bush says he is by nature impatient .
But also : â€œI canâ€ ™ t fake anger ...
I just donâ€ ™ t believe that this countryâ€ ™
s days are going to be deeply , you know , going down.â€ �
Rubio : â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure itâ€ ™ s a weakness , but ... I believe thereâ€ ™ s a sense in this country that our best days lay behind us.â€ �
Trump : Iâ€ ™ m too trusting .
And when they let me down , if they let me down , I never forgive .
Carson :
Probably in terms of applying for a job of president ... would be , not really seeing myself in that position , until hundreds of thousands of people told me to do it .
Fiorina :
Well gee , after the last debate I was told that I didnâ€
™ t smile enough .
[ BIG SMILE ] .
OK thatâ€ ™ s funny .
Cruz : â€œIâ€ ™ m too agreeable , easygoing.â€ � Ha .
â€œYou know I feel my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite .
Iâ€ ™ m a fighter ...
If you want someone to grab a beer with , I might not be the one .
But if you want a ride home , I will get it done.â€
�
Christie : â€œI donâ€ ™ t see a lot of weakness on the stage , quite frankly .
I see weakness on the Democratic stage .
I see a socialist , and isolationist and a pessimist .
And Iâ€ ™ m not sure which is which.â€
�
Paul :
The budget deal this week stinks ...
I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it .
Itâ€ ™ s started .
The candidates are taking the stage .
Carson has just emerged .
He joines Fiorina , Cruz and Christie .
And thereâ€ ™ s the Donald .
Whoâ€ ™ s going to make the wildest promise on cutting taxes ?
Cruz has said he favors a flat tax at an unspecified level .
For a detailed guide to each candidateâ€ ™ s tax plan so far , such as they are , visit the Tax Foundation web site .
Before we move on to the main event , Ben Jacobs in Boulder has been talking to Bobby Jindal .
The Louisiana governor wonâ€
™ t commit to supporting the Republican nominee to succeed him in his stateâ€ ™ s gubernatorial runoff on 21 November .
In last weekâ€ ™ s first round of voting , Senator David Vitter , a Republican , finished second behind Democratic legislator John Bel Edwards in the stateâ€ ™ s â€œjungle primary.â€ �
In Louisiana , all candidates compete in one primary and then the top two then advance to a general election .
Vitter , despite being the favorite , just managed to barely edge out two other Republican candidates .
However , Jindal , who long been engaged in a feud with Vitter , refused to endorse the Republican standard bearer to succeed him .
When asked by the Guardian if he would campaign on Vitterâ€ ™ s behalf , Jindal said : â€œI respect the judgment of the voters in Louisiana .
I think the press makes too much of watching voters try to endorse each other and look forward to seeing which candidate will commit to policies that will continue the economic development weâ€ ™ ve done in Louisiana.â€ �
When pressed about whether he would even endorse Vitter , he said : â€œWe havenâ€ ™ t made that decision yet ; that doesnâ€ ™ t mean we wonâ€ ™ t but we havenâ€
™ t made that decision.â€ � Politics in Louisiana are complicated by the fact Jindal has an approval rating of only 32 % and is deeply disliked by many voters .
Vitter has his own issues .
He was embroiled in a prostitution scandal several years ago and a private investigator employed by his campaign was arrested last week for spying a county sheriff .
Mitt Romney , the 2012 nominee , gives Lindsey Graham an upvote .
Graham does seem to be the subject of some not insubstantial buzz following the undercard the debate .
Reminder : he said : â€œMake me commander in chief and this crap stops.â€
�
Itâ€ ™ s past 8 pm ET , starting time , but the only Republican onstage is RNC chairman Reince Priebus .
We invite you , while we wait , to check in on our live blog coverage of game two of the World Series between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets , where someone has just sung the national anthem .
But donâ€ ™ t get lost over there !
Come on back to Colorado in a few minutes .
Itâ€ ™ s the presidency at stake , here .
Speaking of Ben Carson , here he is testing out his lectern earlier : And hereâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs with a peek at Carsonâ€ ™ s debate strategy this evening :
Cher : not a Ben Carson fan , evidently .
Further reaction to the undercard : The entire country , to hear Google tell it , was all , Who is this Lindsey Graham ! ? !
Except Delaware , which was all , whoa , George Pataki , hello :
Recreational marijuana use is legal in Colorado â€ “ but will CNBC take the opportunity to grill the candidates ?
Jeb Bush copped ( again ) to pot use as a kid in the last debate , apologizing to his mother for announcing it on national TV .
Itâ€ ™ s not just a lifestyle issue for Colorado â€
“ itâ€ ™ s an economic issue .
Republicans must address whether the next president should continue to let states do as they please with marijuana laws , as Obama has done .
Itâ€ ™ s a point of contention among Republican presidential aspirants , and one that could come up again tonight .
Welcome back for our coverage of the big show , the third Republican presidential debate .
Donald Trump has been invited on national television to talk about money .
Ben Carson takes the stage as a freshly minted frontrunner .
Jeb Bush seems on the verge of fumbling the handoff of the White House from bro and pops .
Marco Rubio was born to talk .
Will Trump go after Carson for surpassing him in his beloved polls ?
Will Carson reveal a heretofore hidden depth on economic policy ?
Will Jeb Bush give America a reason to vote for him that does not have to do with his last name ?
( Some reason ! , some say . )
Ted Cruz raised $ 12 m last quarter .
Carly Fiorinaâ€ ™ s whole campaign strategy seems to be to kick ass in debates .
John Kasich seems angry about something .
Rand Paul and Chris Christie are just glad to be invited .
And Mike Huckabee used to be the governor of Arkansas .
The main event is about to start .
Itâ€ ™ s only two hours this time , and itâ€ ™ s going to go fast .
So stay tuned and please let us know whoâ€ ™ s winning â€ “ and whoâ€ ™ s slipping â€ “ in the comments ...
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ben Jacobs is just one cowboy hat away from asking Rick Santorum the question that will settle this thing .
Guardian US business editor Dominic Rushe branches out into hair criticism : From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund , live from Tampa , Florida .
That was a really fun bit during the Kiddie Table debate , when Lindsey Graham joked about being a Fox News instead of CNBC watcher .
Itâ€ ™ s just a little reminder that CNBC is the Marxist network that aired Rick Santelliâ€ ™ s 1 % whine about taxation and moochers that the conservative astroturf group FreedomWorks used to launch the Tea Party .
The undercard debate in Boulder featured a solid , if unexciting , exchange between the four second tier Republican candidates participating , reports Ben Jacobs in Boulder .
South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal , former New York governor George Pataki and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum spent an hour discussing economic issues with occasional moments of feistiness and a near constant stream of one - liners from Graham .
While there was a spirited exchange on tax policy between Jindal and Santorum over the relative importance of balancing the budget and simply cutting taxes in reducing the size of government and George Pataki echoed former Democratic candidate Jim Webb in complaining his lack of speaking time , the real star of the night was Graham .
The South Carolina Republican is well known for his sense of humor and seemed to cracked jokes nonstop during the debate .
Graham mocked Senate colleague Bernie Sanders , saying â€œhe went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I donâ€ ™ t think he ever came backâ€ � while also proclaiming :
â€œI know beer.â€
�
The question is whether Graham will get any mileage out of the debate .
After all , voters are electing a commander in chief and not a comedian in chief .
Weâ€ ™ ve only got 45 minutes till the main debate .
Will the Republicans hit Hillary Clinton for this zany story about running around in a driveway with Bill and Chelsea in a frustrated attempt to crack a coconut ?
In the Democratic frontrunnerâ€ ™ s defense , that was probably before YouTube , and so before about a thousand helpful videos like this one .
While the kids wave their arms and squabble around one of the grown - ups , Jeb Bush , is tweeting , reports Adam Gabbatt .
Heâ€ ™ s made a video !
Visually itâ€ ™ s beautiful .
Thereâ€ ™ s a sunrise !
Someone welding something .
A jazzy shot in the window of a carâ€ ™ s rear view mirror .
Unfortunately for Jeb !
the images donâ€ ™ t quite detract from what he is saying , which is ... strange .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no way that Barack Obama or the progessive liberals in Washington can take away from the bigness of this place , â€ � he says .
He is referring to America .
I looked bigness up and apparently itâ€ ™ s a real word .
Anyway while Bush was governor of Florida â€œwe turned the systems upside down that werenâ€ ™ t workingâ€ � , so suck on that Donald Trump .
Suck on that , gravity .
The video is worth watching for the euphoric backing track alone .
Fetch the glow sticks !
Enjoy the bigness !
Itâ€ ™ s a wrap !
There goes the first round .
Who do you think won ?
Tell us in the comments .
Closing statements : Graham :
Somebody said â€˜letâ€ ™ s make America great againâ€ ™ .
America is great !
I will win a war we canâ€
™ t afford to lose .
Support the troops .
Make me commander - in - chief !
Pataki :
Thanks for the opportunity .
I love 10th Amendment ( balance of powers ) .
I embrace science .
Santorum :
I announced bid from factory floor .
I come from steel country .
I align myself with working men and women .
Jindal : Conservatives , this is our hour .
Democrats are insane and incompetent .
Weâ€
™ re Christians and Americans .
We can not allow Hillary Clinton to take us further down this path toward socialism .
Now Quick trims them to 20 seconds per answer !
Lightning round .
Whew .
What are your top three apps ?
Jindal : wastes his time by saying he has a blackberry not an iphone .
Santorum : MLB , NHL and Wall Street Journal .
Pataki :
Uber ,
Twitter Graham :
The only reason I have an iPhone is because I gave my number to Donald Trump .
Should the day after Super Bowl be a national holiday ?
Jindal :
Go Saints .
I think itâ€ ™ d be a great day to take off .
Santorum :
Go Steelers .
It is in Pennsylvania already .
Pataki :
Go Jets .
No , thereâ€
™ s no reason .
The Mets are gon na win .
Graham :
I think the national holiday would be the day that commander in chief Barack Obama doesnâ€ ™ t have that job .
Go Tom Brady .
Huh .
Google trends is tracking searches for candidatesâ€ ™ names .
Graham is the blue line .
The blue line is often higher than the other lines .
Graham is the nominee .
Commercial !
Letâ€ ™ s check in on the hacks :
Hacks hacking !
Carry on .
Graham is now mounting a near - tearful defense of Social Security .
â€œ50 % of todayâ€ ™ s seniors would be in poverty without Social Security , â€ �
he says .
â€œI promise you if you make me your president , I will save social security because I know why it exists , â€ � he says .
As for beer policy , he says , he grew up behind a bar .
Epperson cuts him off .
What have we learned from kiddie table economics so far , asks Guardian US business editor Dominic Rushe ?
Not a lot .
Socialism is bad , Obama is bad ( and probably a socialist ) , taxes are bad .
Not all Republicans believe climate change is a lie ( but the ones who believe itâ€ ™ s true probably wonâ€ ™ t get elected ) .
And the arid Boulder weather has done wonders for Rick Santorumâ€ ™ s hair .
In terms of economic policy no one has really excelled - let alone broken ahead of the ( trailing ) pack .
Santorum busts out some etymology .
â€œThe word economy comes from the Greek oikonomos which means family , â€ � he says .
FACT CHECK Our dictionary thinks oikonomos means manager of a household and oikos means house .
Did Santorum just blow his last chance at the nomination ?
Pataki believes climate change is real and caused by humans .
Heâ€
™ s asked about that .
â€œOne of the thing that troubles me about the Republican party is that too often we question science that everyone accepts , â€ � he says .
Pataki mentions the science behind vaccines and climate change .
CO2 emissions trap greenhouse gases , he says .
â€œIt does .
Itâ€ ™ s uncontroverted.â€
�
He actually gets a little applause for that talk , from this presumably Republican crowd .
Beer question !
Is it right to have one third of breweries in this country owned by one brewer ?
Is there a threat to competition in beer ?
Now thatâ€ ™ s a debate question .
The debate is happening in an arena named for Coors , which is brewed in nearby Golden at the worldâ€ ™ s very largest brewery .
Santorum says he travels far and wide and , believe him , thereâ€ ™ s a brewery in like every town .
No worries about keeping beer in the USA competitive , he says .
Whew .
Santorum argues that a failure to protect exports pushed Boeing partly to France .
Santorum seems on tonight ?
Heâ€
™ s speaking with energy and conviction about protecting American jobs .
Heâ€ ™ s not going too long , making arguments instead of speeches .
Looking to break 2 % in Iowa .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund , live from Tampa :
Perhaps this doesnâ€ ™ t reflect that well on me , but I can think of no more fitting commentary on the Republican Kiddie Table Debate than the fact that I was washing dishes and cleaning the house on domestic autopilot and listening to my TV blaring CNN commentary about the main debate without realizing that there was an actual debate being broadcast at the time .
I mean , I DVRd it , but still .
Rick Santelli is up .
He asks Pataki : â€œHowâ€ ™ re you doing tonight?â€
�
Patakiâ€ ™ s good .
Santelli says interest rates should be higher for savers who rely on the growth of their deposits .
He ( Santelli ) is taking issue with the Fedâ€ ™ s hesitancy to raise interest rates .
Pataki does not really engage on the monetary policy question .
He does say the Fed screwed up .
Then : â€œNo question Barack Obama faced an economic disaster in 2009,â€ � Pataki said , but he made it worse with Obamacare .
Soundnibbles !
Indeed .
Itâ€ ™ s as if the moderators are afraid of letting the candidates speak .
Or maybe they just have an eye on the ratings , and realize that churn plays better than drone .
Or maybe this is just the bracing fast pace that money moves at .
Pew pew pew ...
Hereâ€ ™ s a question about paid family leave , and mandatory paid maternity leave .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not for the government mandating that , â€ � Jindal says .
â€œWe already have too many mandates out of DC ...
the government canâ€ ™ t wave a magic wand and make that happen.â€
�
He says that Obama has put the country â€œon the path to socialism.â€ �
He says economic growth will magically produce benefits like paid family leave .
Santorum blames immigration for keeping wages and economic participation rates low .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re bringing in people to compete against low - wage workers , â€ � Santorum says .
That of course is highly debatable .
Graham jumps in once again as the realist on immigration .
He says US companies need workers .
â€œIf you
canâ€ ™ t find an American worker after you advertise for a competitive wage , bring inâ€ � workers , Graham says .
Then everybody starts talking .
Pataki is waving his arms .
Heâ€ ™ s noticeably taller than Graham .
Quick wants him to end his speech .
Quintanilla takes the mic .
Graham has committed the heresies , in the context of the current Republican primary conversation , of saying climate change is real and supporting a path to citizenship for undocumented migrants .
Heâ€
™ s asked to defend himself .
â€œI think Iâ€ ™ m trying to solve problems , â€ � Graham says .
â€œI have been to the Antarctic , I have been to Alaska .
Iâ€ ™ m not a scientist , and I have the grades to prove it ...
[ but ] the greenhouse gas effect is real , that weâ€ ™ re heating up the planet .
I just want a solution that does not destroy the economy.â€ �
He also wants to win elections :
â€œIâ€ ™ m tired of losing!â€ � Graham says .
â€œGood god look who weâ€ ™ re running against.â€
�
The number one candidate [ claimed to be broke ] after eight years in the White House .
The number two guy went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon , and I donâ€
™ t think he ever came back .
Laugh line , including among the moderators .
Pataki has a chance to defend Wall Street , as a former New York governor .
He does not .
â€œI think they have gone too far , â€ � he says .
â€œI think weâ€ ™ ve seen Wall Street blossom and do really well , while a lot of people are struggling.â€ �
He blames a corrupt relationship with Washington .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve cut taxes more than anybody on this stage , more than anybody on the next stage combined , â€ � he boasts .
Cramer invites Graham to indulge his darkest fantasies about geopolitical threats bearing down on Americaâ€ ™ s shores .
â€œThe foreign policy of Barack Obama needs to be
replacedâ€ �
and you canâ€
™ t do that by electing his secretary of state , Graham says .
Then he produces quite a moment , raising a fist and an open palm .
â€œTo the Chinese , when it comes to dealing with me , youâ€ ™ ve got a clenched fist and an open hand , and you choose which , â€ � Graham says .
â€œThe partyâ€ ™ s over .
Make me commander in chief and this crap stops!â€ �
Cramer asks Pataki whether we need a military response to cyber - warfare .
( The debate is back on .
This is not happening in some weird corner of the internet .
Itâ€ ™ s happening in a weird corner of national TV . )
Pataki hits out at Clinton for â€œputting an unsecure server ... as secretary of state , that without a doubt was hackedâ€ � by China and Russia .
Pataki says Clinton is disqualified .
The crowd whistles and cheers .
As the undercard debate began , Jeb Bush rolled out an endorsement from a former vice president , notes Ben Jacobs in Boulder .
The Bush campaign announced that George HW Bushâ€ ™ s vice president , Dan Quayle was backing the former Florida governor .
The endorsement drew some skepticism .
Quayle , who mounted an abortive bid for the White House in 2000 against George W Bush , was never regarded as one of the best and the brightest in American politics .
Perhaps his best known moment was in 1992 when he insisted to a grade school student that the word â€œpotatoâ€ � should be spelled â€œpotatoeâ€ � .
Well ... Is Hillary Clinton watching tonight ?
Sheâ€ ™ s playing with the Republicans on Twitter , at least : Commercial .
Do what you have to do around the house .
Jindal says itâ€ ™ s â€œdangerous times for Americaâ€ � because of the size of the debt , $ 18tn .
( The debt limit reset in March was $ 18.113tn . )
My colleague Jana Kasperkevic will be analysing the debate through a series of Vines tonight .
Here she highlights the wealth of the candidates in this undercard debate .
Pataki agrees with Graham on the current budget , saying it protects the military .
An air of comity prevails in Boulder .
Jindalâ€ ™ s tie is pink .
The backdrop to the stage is electric blue and rather aggressively branded with the CNBC logo .
Big moment for the little cable channel that could .
Santorum takes a question about his flat tax - he wants to tax every household income at an even 20 % .
He says the biggest problem is the breakdown of the American family .
He says his plan is pro - growth and pro - family .
He doesnâ€ ™ t get into how throwing out the graduated tax system is more pro - family than a flat tax .
Quick asks about debt limits .
Would you blow through the debt ceiling in order to resist passing a disagreeable budget , like the one before Congress now ?
Jindal says itâ€ ™ s a false choice because the government could cut spending and not keep running through the ceiling .
He says something about â€œturning the American dream into a European nightmare , â€ � with reference to unemployment and growth rates .
Harwood swipes the spotlight .
He asks Graham whether he would vote for a budget deal agreed to Monday night .
Graham ignores the question .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll tell you what is real , â€ � he says .
â€œThe threat to our homeland.â€ �
Heâ€ ™ ll vote for the budget , he says , because it puts â€œ$40bn back in the defense department at a time we need
it.â€
�
Harwood has the first Q. Itâ€ ™ s not about $ $ at all .
Itâ€ ™ s about how popular outsider candidacies are this year and asks Jindal , the Louisiana governor , how he fits the bill .
Jindal says he will chop government , which is the most outsider - y thing of all .
Santorum says that he was a force for reform during his two senate terms .
Pataki , the thrice - elected governor , says Washington needs and outsider but
â€œyou canâ€
™ t just be an outsider.â€
�
Graham says thanks for having him and asks the audience to applaud itself .
He says the only way he could have gotten into UC - Boulder was to be invited to the presidential debate .
Hard to tell whether they laughed .
Then he zooms to the end of his statement about national security threats being real .
The event begins .
Becky Quick introduces the show .
Candidates get 30 seconds per question and the same for rebuttals , she explains .
Quintanilla is on her right , your left .
Harwoodâ€ ™ s on the other side .
Oh pity .
Theyâ€ ™ re making them stand there behind their lecterns without , for the moment , asking them anything .
Itâ€ ™ s a silent debate .
Aaand now theyâ€ ™ ve gone to commercial .
Well , Marco Rubio made a joke on YouTube today .
Did you see it ?
Timeâ€ ™ s up for preliminary niceties .
The four bonus candidates have taken the stage .
Bobby , Rick , George and Lindsey .
Letâ€ ™ s listen to what these guys have to say .
Is Donald Trump in trouble ?
In advance of the debate , he was already complaining about an â€œunfairâ€ � fight
The essence of his beef was that CNBC has been broadcasting the same poll everyone else has picked up on this week , which for the first time since July showed Trump trailing Ben Carson in the nominating race .
It was a solid poll , commissioned by CBS News /New
York Times and conducted over the telephone by people , as opposed to through robo - calling or over the Internet , which latter techniques are considered less effective .
The poll found Carson ahead of Trump 26 - 22 .
Trump would rather have America look at a poll published just today , by YouGov/ The Economist and conducted over the Internet , which shows him ahead of Carson 32 - 18 .
Hosting tonightâ€ ™ s event is the cable channel CNBC , which has wrangled three moderators and three sideline questioners for the job .
Theyâ€ ™ re calling it â€œThe Republican Presidential Debate : Your Money , Your Vote.â€ �
The moderators are Becky Quick , John Harwood and Carl Quintanilla .
The questioners are Jim Cramer , Sharon Epperson and Rick Santelli .
Harwood comes into the event with already one debate scalp tacked to his wall .
Remember Texas Governor Rick Perryâ€ ™ s big â€œoopsâ€ � in 2012 ?
That was thanks to Harwood :
But Santelli may be the real star of the evening :
heâ€ ™ s credited with giving rise â€ “ and giving a name â€ “ to one of the most influential forces in conservative politics in the last 50 years .
A Santelli rant on the floor of the Chicago stock exchange in 2009 about bailing out bad mortgages captured the outrage many Americans felt over what they considered to be bad fiscal habits in Washington and a national malady of spending beyond oneâ€ ™ s means .
Behold , how the Tea Party , in part , was born :
Hello ! and welcome to our coverage of the third Republican presidential debate .
Tonight , itâ€ ™ s all about money .
Money :
whatâ€ ™ s more important to you ?
Whatâ€ ™ s more important to anyone ?
Nothing , and yet too often the national political conversation burbles along with no real discussion of the policies that matter most for your bottom line : taxes , debt , pensions , trade , healthcare and capital - G Growth .
The 14 remaining Republican candidates are going to tear into those questions tonight with their teeth , in what should be at the very least an impressive competition to see who can make the most wildly impossible promises about lowering taxes while protecting the entitlements programs voters hold most dear .
On the off chance that those $ $ topics leave you cold , consider this : tonight may present one of the rare moments when Donald Trump will not be the loudest person in the room .
Hosting the debate this evening will be no fewer than six television personalities from the cable financial news channel CNBC , whose programs go by names like Squawk on the Street and Squawk Alley and Squawk Box .
Itâ€ ™ s a great channel !

2015-10-29,"Republican presidential candidates turned fire on the media on Wednesday as their economic policies were put under the spotlight in an acrimonious but revealing presidential debate in Colorado .
Tough questioning from CNBC moderators , who pressed the candidates over the viability of their tax plans , prompted Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz , Donald Trump , Ben Carson and others to unite against the television network , attacking them for bias .
â€œDo
you want to answer , or do you want me to answer?â€ � demanded governor Chris Christie , who was among the most vocal in taking on CNBC .
â€œEven in New Jersey what you are doing is called rude.â€ �
But the intense focus on the unconventional policies of outsiders â€ “ and current frontrunners
â€
“ Trump and Carson appeared to bolster the hopes of more moderate candidates , particularly Rubio , who used the debate to reinforce his claim to be a strong compromise candidate .
Rubio upstaged his former mentor Jeb Bush , who desperately needed a strong performance to rescue his plummeting poll numbers and restore flagging confidence among donors .
Instead , a clash between Bush , the former governor of Florida , and Rubio , the stateâ€ ™ s senator , was among the most memorable moments of the the night .
The pair , once close allies , are now battling over the same home turf , both a rich vein for donors and a key swing state .
When CNBC moderators brought up a stinging editorial in Floridaâ€ ™ s Sun Sentinel newspaper that pointed out Rubio had missed more votes than any other senator , and should consider resigning , Bush pounced .
â€œMarco , when you signed up for this , this was a six - year term , and you should be showing up to work , â€ � said Bush .
â€œI mean , literally the Senate , what is it , like a French work week ?
You get like three days where you have to show up?â€ �
But the younger rival managed to turn difficult questions into an opportunity to boast of his humble background and promise of change .
â€œI am not running against Governor Bush I am running for president , â€ � responded Rubio , who appeared among the most polished of the 10 candidates in the main debate .
Turning to his former mentor , Rubio added : â€œSomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you .
Itâ€ ™ s not.â€
�
However , it was Rubio and some other candidatesâ€ ™ concerted pushback at the TV moderators , whom they accused of liberal bias , that proved to be the biggest talking point after the debate .
Trump , who has for months been the frontrunner in an average of national polls of Republicans , accused TV executives of seeking to profit from overly long debates and blasted what he claimed were â€œnasty and ridiculousâ€ � questions .
Carson , who is gaining ground on Trump , particularly in the first - in - the nation primary state of Iowa , received vocal support from the crowd after he was questioned on his links to a disgraced pharmaceutical company .
He concluded his appearance by thanking fellow panellists â€œfor not falling for the trapsâ€ � .
â€œThe questions that have been asked so far on this debate illustrate why the American people donâ€ ™ t trust the media , â€ � claimed Cruz in comments that brought some of the biggest cheers of the night from the Colorado crowd .
The Texas senator even went so far as to stand up for several rival candidates , defending them against CNBCâ€ ™ s moderators .
Reince Priebus , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , which organises the debates in coordination with TV networks , reacted angrily to the line of questioning .
â€œWhile
I was proud of our candidates and the way they handled
tonightâ€
™ s debate , the performance by the CNBC moderators was extremely disappointing and did a disservice to their network , our candidates , and voters ,
â€ �
he said in a statement .
â€œCNBC should be ashamed of how this debate was handled.â€
�
The aggressive scrutiny was welcomed by Democrats , who used the opportunity of the debate to send out a fundraising email to supporters .
â€œI had chills watching the debate tonight â€ “ and not in a good way , â€ � wrote the Democratic National Committeeâ€ ™ s chair , Debbie Wasserman Schultz .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t let a single one of them get close to the White House.â€
�
The forensic questioning also laid bare some of the unconventional policies and claims made by candidates , particularly Carson and Trump .
The latter faced an especially embarrassing moment when CNBC moderator Becky Quick asked the real estate mogul about his claim that Rubio was Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbergâ€ ™ s â€œpersonal senatorâ€ � .
Trump disputed ever having made the statement â€ “ and claimed to be unaware where Quick could have found such erroneous information .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œYou people write this stuff.â€
�
As Quick pointed out 20 minutes later , it came from the immigration policy paper on Trumpâ€ ™ s own website .
Despite the heat , there was also substantially more light than in previous debates as candidates were held to account over what many economists view as extreme tax and spending policies as well as conflicting promises on social security .
â€œFolks , we got ta wake up , â€ � said Ohio governor John Kasich in an opening exchange which hinted at a concerted establishment fight - back against the outsiders .
â€œWe can not elect someone who doesnâ€ ™ t know how to do the job.â€ �
The veiled attack on Trump produced a typically robust response from the billionaire TV celebrity , who said Kasichâ€ ™ s poll numbers had tanked .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why heâ€ ™ s on the end [ of the stage],â€ �
Trump said .
â€œAnd then he got nasty.â€ �
CNBC business journalist John Harwood further rattled Trump by asking if his fiscal policy amounted to a â€œcomic - book way to run a presidential campaignâ€ � .
But the difficult questioning was not limited to the so - called â€œoutsiderâ€ � candidates who have never held public office .
Rubio , for example , was asked : â€œDo you have the maturity and the wisdom to lead a $ 17tn economy?â€
�
He responded by accusing the mainstream media of favouring Democrats and failing to hold Hillary Clinton to account in their coverage of the Benghazi hearings .
â€œDemocrats have the ultimate Super Pac , itâ€ ™ s called the mainstream media , â€ � he said .
Danny Diaz , Bushâ€ ™ s campaign manager , later tried to push back on the narrative that Rubio had gotten the better of his candidate .
â€œI think Marco Rubio is an outstanding performer .
We knew that going in , we know
that coming out , â€ � he said .
â€œThe reality is that he doesnâ€ ™ t have a record of accomplishment .
The reality is that he hasnâ€ ™ t demonstrated that he is qualified to be president.â€ �
Meanwhile , Trump , predictably , heralded himself the victor .
â€œI think I did very well according to all the online polls , â€ � he said afterwards .
â€œI got 80 % as a win and hundreds of thousands of people are sending their numbers in and according to every single poll
thatâ€ ™ s a win.â€ �
His wife , Melania , accompanying him for the first time on the trail , said her husband had been â€œfantasticâ€ � .
While Bush and other stragglers such as Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee failed to make much impression on the debate , the third Republican TV showdown revealed how wide open its primary race remains compared with a Democratic race increasingly dominated by Clinton ."
2015-10-29,"The third Republican debate is over .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned : There were tricky questions for Marco Rubio , the senator from Florida , about missing a lot of votes in Congress , for Ted Cruz , the senator from Texas , about his contrarianism ... and one about fantasy football that Chris Christie , the governor of New Jersey , spiked in the end zone .
â€œWe are $ 19tn in debt , we have Isis and al - Qaida attacking us , and weâ€ ™ re talking about fantasy football?â€ �
he exclaimed .
Cruz got cheers for attacking the media , successfully turning the crowd against the moderators by saying the quality of the questions was â€œwhy the American people donâ€
™ t trust the mediaâ€ � .
The moderatorsâ€ ™ performance was also decried afterward by Reince Priebus , the national Republican chairman , on Twitter .
The crowd booed one moderator for pressing Ben Carson , the retired pediatric neurosurgeon , on whether his appearance on the website of a company later accused of false advertising did not reflect badly on his judgment .
Carson said he had nothing to do with the company .
It emerged through fact - checking , however , that Carson had in fact performed in a video for the company .
The episode was representative of an uneven night for the doctor .
Rubio repeatedly turned tricky questions into strong applause lines .
Pressed on having to liquidate a retirement fund even after a $ 1 m book deal , Rubio quipped : â€œAnd I used it to pay off my loans .
And itâ€ ™ s available in paperback!â€ �
Jeb Bush stumbled in trying to attack Rubio for not showing up for work in the Senate , and reverted to flat stump speech - talk when he got a chance to talk about his economic plan .
Donald Trump , the erstwhile frontrunner , turned in an uncharacteristically short - winded performance , denied ever having made a criticism of Rubio that was printed on his website and used his closing statement to brag about having held the debate to two hours instead of three .
Everyone from the audience to the moderators to the candidates to the online audience seemed thankful to Trump for that .
The other four candidates â€ “ former tech CEO Carly Fiorina , Ohio governor John Kasich , Senator Rand Paul and former governor Mike Huckabee â€ “ seemed to hold their places without breaking through .
The possible exception was Kasich , who had a couple of persuasive moments of exasperation at the â€œfantasyâ€ � plans for entitlements and immigration presented by his rivals ."
2015-11-12,"Firebrand senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s tax plans are â€œcrazyâ€ � and would cost the US at least $ 16.2tn , according to an analysis by thinktank Citizens for Tax Justice ( CTJ ) .
The Republican presidential candidate who has made a name for himself attacking government spending set out specific tax plans earlier this week that he claimed would cost $ 1tn .
He also announced plans to shut down the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and replace the taxman with a 10 % flat - rate income tax , that he said would reduce personal income taxes by 60 % .
Such a plan would cost $ 12.8tn over a decade , according to CTJ .
Cruz would also eliminate corporate income tax , at a 10-year cost of $ 4.7tn , and repeal the estate tax , at a cost of $ 300bn , the left - leaning thinktank calculates .
Cruzâ€ ™ s other major proposal is to repeal payroll taxes for social security and Medicare ( at a cost of $ 13.1tn ) and replace those taxes with a value - added tax , or national sales tax , that would raise $ 14.7tn .
All in all , CTJ calculates the Cruz plan would reduce total federal revenues by about 37 % .
On Tuesday at the fourth Republican presidential debate Cruz said his flat rate plan would mean â€œevery income group will see double - digit increases â€ “ from the very poorest to the very weakest â€ “ of at least 14 % .
So if youâ€ ™ re a single mom , if youâ€ ™ re making $ 40,000 a year , what that means is an extra about $ 5,000 in your pocket to provide for your kids , to make ends meet .
It has a powerful , powerful effect.â€ � Bob McIntyre , CTJâ€ ™ s director , said the plan was unworkable and could be even more expensive than his calculation .
â€œCruzâ€ ™ s claim that his plan would cost â€˜less than a trillionâ€ ™ depends critically on raising an enormous amount from his 16 % VAT , which would apply to almost everything American consumers purchase .
The remaining revenue shortfall would , in Cruzâ€ ™ s estimate , be offset by a supposed economic boom based on the discredited supply - side magic that has been part of the far rightâ€ ™ s economic fantasies for decades , â€ � said McIntyre .
â€œBut Cruzâ€ ™ s math has a gigantic hole in it .
He wouldnâ€ ™ t just make consumers pay his VAT , he would also make the government pay the tax ( to itself ) on all of its purchases , from warplanes to paper clips and the wages it pays to its employees .
Cruzâ€ ™ s claim that the government can raise money by taxing itself accounts for a third of the alleged yield from his VAT .
Without this sleight of hand , Cruzâ€ ™ s overall plan would cost more than $ 16tn over a decade and reduce total federal revenues by well over a third.â€ � McIntyre said his $ 16tn cost estimate may seriously understate the real cost of Cruzâ€ ™ s plan , since he says he will eliminate the IRS .
â€œIf he really means that , then he would apparently reduce total federal revenues by close to 100 % , since without a tax collection agency , no one would pay any taxes , â€ � said McIntyre .
CTJ has run similar analyses of plans by other Republican candidates including frontrunner Donald Trump , Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush .
With those analyses CTJ calculated a distributional analysis , working out which income groups would receive the most benefits from the cuts .
Rubioâ€ ™ s plan , for example , would give the top 1 % a tax cut of $ 220,00 a year , according to CTJ .
McIntyre did not do a distributional analysis for Cruzâ€ ™ s plan because
â€œitâ€ ™ s
too crazyâ€ � ."
2015-11-13,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz on Friday took a sharp turn to the right by laying out a plan that would place new limits on legal immigration , increase deportations of undocumented immigrants , end birthright citizenship and build a wall along the US - Mexico border .
The Texas senator unveiled his proposal at a fiery campaign rally in Orlando , Florida , where he echoed the hardline immigration rhetoric of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
While Cruz has been a vocal opponent of comprehensive immigration reform , the senator has until now supported measures to expand legal immigration to the United States .
But in recent days , he has been locked in a war of words with Marco Rubio , the Florida senator who like Cruz has steadily risen in the Republican presidential polls .
Cruzâ€ ™ s latest move marks an attempt by the senator to seize Trumpâ€ ™ s followers and claim the mantle of the outsider candidate during a primary driven in no insignificant part by divisions over immigration .
Under his new plan , Cruz pledged to â€œbuild a wall that worksâ€ � and triple the number of patrol agents along the Mexican border .
Most notably , he proposed to halt increases to legal immigration â€œso long as workforce participation rates remain below historical averagesâ€ � , an undisputed about - face from policies Cruz has previously championed .
Cruz has previously backed a five - fold expansion of the H-1B visa program for high - skilled workers , a position he frequently touted before pro - business audiences .
One amendment introduced by Cruz in 2013 , during an immigration reform debate in the Senate , would have increased the number of H-1B visas to 325,000 from 65,000 annually for high - skilled workers .
On Friday , Cruz also said the H-1B visa program should be suspended for 180 days to probe reports of abuse .
â€œLegal immigration needs to be structured so that it serves Americaâ€ ™ s needs , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œWe welcome people from all over the world , but we shouldnâ€
™ t welcome people defying and gaming our laws.â€ � Cruz also declared that it was â€œwell past time to end birthright citizenshipâ€
� , echoing his recent support for an amendment to the US constitution and an idea pushed heavily by Trump over the summer .
Although Cruz said months ago that he held a similar view , the Texas senator said as recently as August that it would be â€œdifficult to achieveâ€ � .
And in 2011 , Cruz argued that it was â€œa
mistakeâ€ � for conservatives to try and fight the constitutionâ€ ™ s protection of birthright citizenship .
Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father and held dual citizenship until last year .
But as questions surfaced over the legality of a potential presidential bid on his part , Cruz formally renounced his Canadian citizenship .
Cruz also said he would immediately repeal Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions on immigration , which provide deportation relief to millions of undocumented immigrants â€ “ including those brought to the country as children and the parents of US citizens or lawful permanent residents .
Rubio has also vowed to phase out Obamaâ€ ™ s immigration programs , although he has not committed to doing so right away .
Cruz and Rubio are the only two Latino candidates on either side of the 2016 field , and both have benefited in recent weeks after registering strong performances in consecutive debates .
Speculation has risen that the Republican primary could boil down to the two first - term , 44-year - old senators , and Cruz began to hint earlier this week at how he would approach a battle with Rubio .
Cruz initially dubbed Rubio as a â€œmoderateâ€ � who would compete in the establishment lane , a veiled jab in a primary dominated by outsiders and deep - rooted frustration with Washington .
After the fourth Republican presidential debate , Cruz quickly picked a fight with Rubio over his work on a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 and likened Rubioâ€ ™ s support for the legislation as being in favor of â€œamnestyâ€ � .
Although Rubio has long distanced himself from the bill , it continues to be seen as his main liability in the primary â€ “ especially with figures like Trump and Cruz looking to further incite conservative anger over the issue with sharp anti - immigration rhetoric .
Rubio hit back by highlighting Cruzâ€ ™ s own support for legalizing undocumented immigrants .
During the same immigration debate in 2013 , Cruz offered an amendment to Rubioâ€ ™ s bill that would guarantee legal status but bar any pathway to citizenship .
â€œOn
the immigration front
â€ ¦ Iâ€
™ m puzzled and quite frankly surprised by Tedâ€ ™ s attacks since Tedâ€ ™ s position on immigration is not much different than mine , â€ � Rubio told reporters Friday after addressing a Republican conference in Orlando , where Cruz also spoke .
â€œHe is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally .
â€œIf heâ€
™ s changed that position , he certainly has a right to change his position on that issue , but he should be clear about that.â€ �
Cruz laughed off Rubioâ€ ™ s comments in his own interview Friday , calling it a â€œtruly stunningâ€ � statement .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s like Obama saying my position is the same as his on Obamacare , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s like Ayatollah Khamenei saying my position is the same as his on the Iranian nuclear deal.â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has insisted the legalization measure was designed to kill the broader immigration reform efforts .
As his aides put it , Cruzâ€ ™ s goal was to expose that Democrats would settle for nothing less than citizenship in the hopes that Republicans might rescind their support for the comprehensive bill â€ “
but it passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote anyway .
Even so , several clips and interviews with Cruz reveal he advocated in favor of legalization â€ “ which were fervently circulated by Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign over the past two days on social media and in press releases .
Cruzâ€ ™ s new immigration plan did not address the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants .
Whereas Trump has said he would deport them all , Cruz proposed simply to â€œincrease
deportationsâ€ � and multiple attempts by reporters on Friday to get more specificity were ignored .
In his remarks on Friday , Cruz launched into a lengthy rant against â€œamnestyâ€ � in a bid to portray it as counter to conservative ideals .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re supporting amnesty ,
youâ€ ™ re supporting the Obama - Clinton abandoning of the nation of Israel , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re supporting amnesty , youâ€ ™ re supporting the Ayatollah Khomeini having nuclear weapons in Iran.â€ �"
2015-11-14,"Ted Cruz led Republican criticism of White House policy on Syria on Saturday , in light of the devastating terror attacks in Paris , deriding Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s pledge to take more refugees and calling for intensified action against Islamic State .
Marco Rubio took a different tack , however , in declaring â€œa civilizational conflict with radical Islamâ€ � .
â€œThis is not a grievance - based conflict , â€ �
Rubio said in a video released by his presidential campaign .
â€œThis is a clash of civilizations .
And either they win , or we win.â€
�
Cruz and presidential candidates including Donald Trump , Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee seized on the news to demand drastic action on immigration , a hot - button issue on the campaign trail .
Rubio , however , has made foreign policy a central focus of his run for the White House .
In that light , he said the attacks in Paris were â€œa wake - up callâ€ � .
â€œThey literally want to overthrow our society and replace it with their radical , Sunni Islamic view of the future , â€ � the Florida senator said .
â€œThey do not hate us because we have military assets in the Middle East .
â€œThey hate us because of our values .
They hate us because young girls here go to school .
They hate us because women drive .
They hate us because we have freedom of speech , because we have diversity in our religious beliefs .
They hate us because weâ€ ™ re a tolerant society.â€ �
Cruz , the senator from Texas who is riding high with rightwing voters , unleashed a scathing indictment of Obama and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton .
â€œPresident Obama and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America
: it is nothing less than lunacy , â€ �
he said , in an interview with Fox News .
He later said the US should â€œnot allow jihadists to come back to America using US passports to murder innocent men and womenâ€ � .
Rubio also criticized the president for lacking a strategy against Isis .
The Florida senator called for a more aggressive tack against the militants , although he placed the onus on Sunni countries to defeat Isis â€œideologically and militarilyâ€ � with the US playing a supporting role .
Other candidates kept their focus on the implications of the Paris attacks for immigration policy .
The Kentucky senator Rand Paul went directly after Rubio , who two years ago co - authored a comprehensive immigration reform bill .
Paul said he had offered an amendment to Rubioâ€ ™ s bill that would have applied â€œspecial scrunityâ€ � to immigrants coming to the US from countries â€œthat have large jihadistsâ€ � .
He then accused Rubio of having done a â€œsecret dealâ€ � with Democrats to block any amendments to the bill .
â€œMy amendment ... was defeated because Rubio was more intent on working with Chuck Schumer than he was in working with conservatives , â€ �
Paul said .
Alex Conant , a spokesman for Rubio , disputed the claim .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what Senator Paul is talking about .
The Senate voted on amendments , including conservative ones , â€ �
Conant told the Guardian .
â€œIt would appear Senator Paul is trying to change the subject away from his dangerous isolationist agenda and proposals to cut defense spending.â€ �
But in a sign that the immigration debate would continue to dominate the Republican primary , other contenders reacted to the Paris attacks with calls to ramp up security along US borders .
At a rally in Beaumont , Texas , Donald Trump said : â€œWith the problems our country has , to take in 250,000 people , some of whom are going to have problems , big problems , is just insane.â€ �
Elsewhere , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal said it was time â€œto close our borders and keep our people safe from these radical , evil terroristsâ€ � .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t just have open borders like they do in Europe.â€
�
In September , the White House said it would accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in the fiscal year starting on 1 October 2015 , up from less than 2,000 .
Refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war have caused a crisis in Europe , where rightwing politicians reacted to the Paris attacks with tough rhetoric .
It was reported on Saturday that one of the gunmen who carried out the Paris attacks was a Syrian who passed through Greece as a refugee last month .
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bomb and shooting attacks in Paris on Friday night , in which 129 people were killed and 352 wounded , 99 of them critically .
The group said it had acted in response to French involvement in Syria .
On Saturday , the US military said an airstrike had killed the Isis leader in Libya .
Speaking to reporters ahead of a â€œrally for religious libertyâ€ � in Greenville , South Carolina , Cruz said of the victims of the Paris attacks : â€œThey were not injured by some faceless menace .
They were not injured by some abstract and inchoate violent extremism .
â€œThey were injured by radical Islamic terrorism , an evil that is at war with the people of America , that is at war with freedom - loving people across the globe.â€ � Repeating a common charge against Obama regarding semantics as much as policy , Cruz added : â€œWe need a commander - in - chief willing to utter the words â€˜radical Islamic terrorismâ€ ™ because it is the Islamists who embrace this extreme political and theological philosophy that â€ ¦ will murder or try to forcibly convert anyone that doesnâ€ ™ t share their extreme view of Islam.â€
�
Cruz continued :
â€œI call on Congress to pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act , legislation Iâ€ ™ ve introduced that says that any American who goes and takes up arms and joins Isis to wage jihad against the United States of America , that by doing so they forfeit their American citizenship .
â€œWe should not allow jihadists to come back to America using US passports to murder innocent men and women.â€ � Huckabee â€ “ who , unlike Cruz , is well off the pace in polls of the 2016 field and missed out on

prime - time Republican debate â€ “ said Syrian refugees should be provided a safe haven , but it did not have to be in the US .
â€œWe need to have a better process , â€ � Huckabee said on CNN .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t just have open borders like they do in Europe.â€
�
Huckabee also attacked Obama for saying recently that Isis had been â€œcontainedâ€ � and said the president was more concerned with â€œimage of Islamâ€ � than defeating extremist terror groups .
The former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum , speaking at the Republican Party of Floridaâ€ ™ s Sunshine Summit , said he was uniquely qualified to lead the US in the effort against Islamic State because â€œno other presidential candidate has been in [ the ] Isis magazineâ€ � .
Promising a major offensive against Isis if he made it to the White House , he said : â€œThey know who I am and I know who they are.â€ �
In South Carolina , Cruz advocated a similar course of action and invoked a familiar Republican exemplar , saying : â€œWhat is the answer to radical Islamic terrorism ?
It is , to paraphrase President Ronald Reagan with regard to the Cold War , very simple .
We win , they lose .
That is the only appropriate resolution to this.â€ �
He continued : â€œIt would start with a commander - in - chief laying out the objective that we will utterly destroy Isis .
The next thing that would happen would be using overwhelming air power .
You know , in the first Persian Gulf war we launched roughly 1,100 air attacks a day .
Overwhelming air power .
â€œRight now , President Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day .
It is pinprick air assault .
It is photo - op foreign policy .
It makes for a good shot on CNN , but it doesnâ€ ™ t actually do anything to stop the terrorists.â€ �
On Friday , Cruz issued a statement which appeared to suggest that airstrikes that risked killing innocent civilians would be acceptable , given the nature of the threat ."
2015-11-18,"Cuban immigrants account for less than 1 % of the US population , but they are uniquely poised by our immigration system to receive power and status that , in just one generation , can produce a candidate â€ “ or two â€ “ ready to enter the political scene on a national level .
Thatâ€ ™ s why , though most Hispanics lean Democrat , though they are the largest minority population in the US , and though Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s entire presidential campaign should be a Hispanic recruitment coup for the Democratic party , itâ€ ™ s not actually surprising that the two Hispanic frontrunners in the presidential race , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , are both Republicans .
When pollsters say the vast majority of Hispanics lean Democrat , theyâ€ ™ re speaking of Mexican Americans , who make up the largest group of Hispanics by a landslide .
Nearly two - thirds of Hispanic Americans
â€ “ 64 %
â€ “ are of Mexican descent .
Sixty - five percent of those , or 22.3 million , are US - born .
Hispanics of Mexican origin make up 11 % of the US population .
But Mexican and Cuban immigrants have had vastly different experiences immigrating to this country .
When Cubans are caught entering the United States without documentation , theyâ€ ™ re granted refuge if they have at least one foot on US soil .
Before 1980 , when both Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s parents and Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father arrived in this country , any Cuban could receive political refuge in the United States even if they were rescued at sea .
A year after arriving , those Cuban immigrants could apply for permanent residency and eventually US citizenship .
Think about that the next time you hear Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father Rafael bragging about coming to the US legally .
Immigration policy is just the beginning of the Cuban immigrantâ€ ™ s advantage in the United States .
During Fidel Castroâ€ ™ s Cuba , which lasted until 2008 , US banks pioneered small business loans for Cuban exiles who had no credit or collateral in this country .
With that startup capital , Cuban immigrants were uniquely set up by the American establishment to succeed financially .
Their neighborhoods and communities were able to develop robust economic and political systems to support the success of newer Cuban immigrants .
Their descendants had a fast track to join the American elite .
As a result , according to the Pew Research Center , compared with the rest of the Hispanic population in the United States , Cubans have a higher level of education , higher median household income and higher rate of home ownership .
Mexican Americans , on the other hand , inherit a legacy of discrimination that goes back to the founding of this country .
The highly controversial Mexican American war , which secured Texas , California and the land in between for the US , is acknowledged by historians to be a land grab of dubious moral imperative .
General Ulysses S Grant , who fought in it , said it was â€œone of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation .
It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies , in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.â€ �
The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 , but many of the Hispanic families that remained in the newly created American south - west had their land grants stolen by Anglo settlers .
These grabs were often backed by the American statesâ€ ™ court systems .
Thus began a grand American tradition of redlining American citizens of Mexican descent that continued openly until the 1980s , when it went largely underground .
It still exists today in the form of economically depressed neighborhoods and even whole regions , like the one from which I hail : the Rio Grande valley of Texas .
The legacy of over 150 years of Mexican Americans â€ “ and later , immigrants from throughout Latin America â€ “ being segregated into the poorest communities our country has to offer has resulted in Hispanic Americansâ€ ™ devastatingly low educational attainment rate and high rates of poverty , unemployment , incarceration and poor health .
These circumstances hardly provide a pool brimming with high - level political talent .
So Mexican Americans and other Hispanics are still not appearing in positions of national political power in proportion to their numbers â€ “ especially not within the Democratic party .
In fact , a recent op - ed from NBC News points out that Bob Menendez is the only Latino Democrat in the US Senate , and heâ€ ™ s in danger of losing the job due to possible federal corruption charges .
There are also only two Latino governors in the country , and they are both Republicans .
There are exceptions to these dire numbers .
I know hundreds of them .
Latinos who , despite growing up in less - than - ideal circumstances , managed through great parenting , the advantages won by civil rights activists of the baby boomer generation and some God - given brains , to rise to the top of their fields .
Two high - profile examples of this , and the best chance Americans have for a future Democratic presidential candidate of Hispanic descent , are the 41-year - old Castro twins of San Antonio , Texas .
Joaquin is a US congressman , and JuliÃ¡n was the mayor of San Antonio and now serves as the US secretary of housing and urban development .
Their mother , Rosie , is an activist who raised her sons on her own .
She taught them to value community service and education , and they both graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Law .
They have been in the national spotlight since Barack Obama ran for re - election and I believe they are , wisely , waiting until they are a little older before one of them throws his hat in the ring for the White House
â€ “ though there are rumors that JuliÃ¡n is on the shortlist to become Hillary Clintonâ€ ™
s
running mate
should she gain the Democratic nomination .
Texas Democratic party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa â€ “ the first Hispanic to hold the position
â€ “ told me in a written statement that his organization believes many issues important to Latinos , such as increasing incomes , making debt - free college a reality , ensuring paid - family leave , improving healthcare and fixing a broken immigration system , have been well represented by the current list of Democratic presidential candidates , but his organization hopes that whoever wins the nomination will consider a Latino running mate .
â€œTexas Democrats like JuliÃ¡n and Joaquin Castro have the values , government and leadership experience to be president , â€ � Hinojosa said .
For today , Hispanics have a choice between voting for a party that openly hates them and one that takes them for granted , because who else are they going to vote for ?
How long can Democrats hold on to Hispanics with this tactic ?
If the Republicans keep recruiting conservative Cubans , sooner or later they will grab a larger share of the rest of the Hispanic vote , too ."
2015-11-18,"Here are a few of the things conservatives have done in response to the terrorist attacks on Paris : multiple Republican governors â€ “ and one Democrat â€ “ have announced they will do everything in their power to keep Syrian refugees out of their states ; Donald Trump has called for shutting down mosques ; his fellow candidates Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have proposed screening refugees and allowing just Christians in while keeping Muslims out .
These are acts born of fear , and it is rational to be afraid of terrorists .
There is no doubt Isis would love to attack the United States , and it is perfectly reasonable to want to take steps to beef up our security while still promoting American values by offering a safe haven to refugees .
A Paris - style attack in the United States would be a horror , and we should take reasonable , commonsense steps to prevent such a scenario â€ “ like making sure terrorists canâ€ ™ t get guns .
But if there is anything more irrational in this world than violent religious extremism , itâ€ ™ s the American gun lobby .
It is extremely easy for terrorists to obtain a gun in the United States .
There is a federal requirement for background checks , but the loopholes are so big you could drive a Mack truck filled with AR-15s through them .
Gun shows , private sales and the internet all make it simple for anyone who wants a mess of assault rifles to obtain them easily .
Itâ€ ™ s so easy that in 2011 , al - Qaida released a video urging radicalized Muslims in the US to buy guns to carry out terror attacks .
â€œAmerica is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , â€ � said the American - born terrorist who narrated the video .
He was right .
Not only is it simple to obtain a gun in America without a background check , but terrorist ties donâ€ ™ t prevent you from buying a gun even if they show up on a background check .
You canâ€ ™ t pass a background check if youâ€ ™ re a felon .
You canâ€ ™ t pass one if youâ€ ™ ve been involuntarily institutionalized ( assuming it shows up on the check ) .
But if the federal government suspects youâ€ ™ re tied to Isis , al - Qaida or any other recognized terror organization , you can walk into a gun shop and buy any gun you want , background check and all .
As late as this year , bipartisan coalitions in Congress have attempted to pass a law that would forbid anyone on a terrorist watchlist from purchasing a gun .
But the National Rifle Association opposes the law , because it reflexively opposes any legislation restricting gun ownership , no matter how much support it has , even among its own members .
That includes closing the background - check loopholes , so we know if people trying to buy guns
shouldnâ€ ™ t have them .
It includes a national firearm registry , so we know who has the guns .
It includes allowing the Centers for Disease Control to study gun violence , so we can determine the best ways to prevent it .
And yes , it even includes keeping people with suspected terrorist ties from buying guns in the first place .
In Texas , Governor Greg Abbott was one of the Republicans who announced he would do what he could to keep Syrian refugees out of his state .
A state representative , Republican Tony Dale , expressed one of his top concerns about allowing refugees in : it would be too easy for them to buy guns in Texas .
So many politicians fear an Isis attack that it could keep refugees who desperately need our help from reaching safe haven in the United States .
Maybe those politicians should redirect that energy toward something that could go to prevent real violence , and work to put some sensible restrictions on gun ownership .
At the very least , they could deny guns to terrorists ."
2015-11-20,"The race for the Republican nomination for the White House took a new turn in the aftermath of the Paris terrorist attacks on Thursday as the front - runner , Donald Trump , called for a database to track Muslims living in the United States , while his closest rival , Ben Carson , suggested refugees of the Syrian conflict should be screened as they might be â€œrabid
dogsâ€ � .
As the rhetoric exploded , the House of Representatives voted by an overwhelming majority to stiffen requirements to vet Syrian refugees seeking to enter the United States , and CNN , the cable news network , suspended a reporter for two weeks for reporting the news on Twitter with the comment : â€œStatue of Liberty bows head in anguishâ€ � .
A week after attackers linked with the Islamic State group killed 132 people in Paris , the simmering political debate in the United States rose to a boil , with Trump , Carson , Texas Senator Ted Cruz , former Florida governor Jeb Bush and others floating new proposals they said would protect the United States from such an event .
Earlier in the week Cruz and Bush proposed a religious test for refugees from Syria â€ “ only about 2,200 of whom have entered the United States in the last four years after extensive security vetting
â€ “ saying that Christian applicants should be prioritized .
By Thursday a religious test for refugees had become a religious test for all Americans for one Republican candidate , with Trump telling reporters he would â€œabsolutelyâ€ � implement a database of American Muslims and unspecified other measures .
â€œI would certainly implement that .
Absolutely , â€ � Trump told NBC between town hall appearances in Iowa .
â€œThere should be a lot of systems , beyond databases , â€ � he added .
â€œWe should have a lot of systems .
And today you can do it.â€ �
Asked whether there would be a sign - up at mosques , Trump said : â€œDifferent places .
You sign them up at different places .
Itâ€ ™ s all about management.â€
�
Asked how the practice of registering Muslims would be different from registering Jews in Nazi Germany , Trump said : â€œYou tell me.â€
�
Earlier he told Yahoo :
â€œCertain
things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy.â€
�
Asked whether this might mean registering Muslims in a database or giving them a form of special identification that noted their religion , the candidate would not rule it out .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely , â€ � Trump said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have to look at the mosques .
Weâ€
™ re going to have to look very , very carefully.â€
�
The US Holocaust Memorial Museum was moved to join the debate on Thursday with an extraordinary statement .
â€œAcutely aware of the consequences to Jews who were unable to flee Nazism , the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum looks with concern upon the current refugee crisis ,
â€ � the statement began .
â€œWhile recognizing that security concerns must be fully addressed , we should not turn our backs on the thousands of legitimate refugees.â€ �
A spokesperson for the museum said the statement was not released based on any one statement from a presidential candidate or on the House vote .
â€œWe have been evaluating the situation over the past days and weeks , â€ � said museum spokesman Andrew Hollinger in an email to the Guardian .
â€œThe statement was not timed with a specific announcement .
It was released when we evaluated the situation and felt that we needed to contribute to the conversations.â€ �
On Thursday , Carson , who has opposed all new entries for Syrian refugees , sought to explain his position at a campaign stop in Alabama with an analogy about rabid dogs .
â€œIf thereâ€
™ s
a rabid dog running around in your neighborhood , youâ€ ™ re probably not going to assume something good about that dog , â€ � Carson said .
â€œAnd youâ€ ™ re probably going to put your children out of the way .
That doesnâ€
™ t mean that you hate all dogs.â€ �
The retired neurosurgeon later insisted that his statement only referred to terrorists .
Republican candidate Jeb Bush criticised Trumpâ€ ™ s comments as â€œabhorrentâ€ � in an appearance on CNBC on Friday .
â€œThere are no Christian terrorists wandering around the world trying to take out peace - loving Muslims .
This is a serious problem , â€ � he said .
â€œIt does not mean we should be disrespectful of Muslims in our country or anything like that .
In fact , I find it abhorrent that Donald Trump is suggesting we register people.â€ �
The clamor stateside followed sharp criticism of the Republican position on Tuesday from Barack Obama , speaking in the Philippines where he was attending a regional summit .
â€œWe are not well served when , in response to a terrorist attack , we descend into fear and panic , â€ � Obama said .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t make good decisions if itâ€ ™ s based on hysteria or an exaggeration of risks.â€ �
The House vote was widely seen as a symbolic acknowledgment of national angst in the wake of the latest brazen terror attack on a world capital .
Democrat Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri , who opposed the House bill , told reporters : â€œPeople are scared â€ “ it has nothing to do with party affiliation , but people in this country right now are frightened over what they see as a flawed immigration system.â€ �
He said any politician who disregarded â€œthe legitimate and very real fear thatâ€ ™ s out there , weâ€ ™ re going to get slapped
aroundâ€ � .
However he insisted the bill was simply designed to make people â€œfeel betterâ€ � about a vetting process that was already very rigorous and would never become law .
Cleaver echoed the thoughts of Bob Corker , the Republican chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
The Tennessee senator told reporters that he thought the administration was undermining its own attempts to convince the American public that Syrian refugees should continue to be admitted .
â€œSomeone needs to explain clearly to American people the processes that we go through before we admit refugees , â€ � Corker said .
â€œTo browbeat someone because they are concerned about their kids is not a productive process.â€

2015-11-24,"Without ever leading in a single poll , Ted Cruz has become the frontrunner in Iowa .
The Texas senator and conservative firebrand has closed the gap on real - estate mogul Donald Trump and is now trailing Trump by only a margin of 25 % to 23 % in the Hawkeye State , according to a poll released on Tuesday by Quinnipiac University .
But , more than that , Cruz has been notching up key endorsements in Iowa and positioning himself to win the stateâ€ ™ s first - in - the - nation caucuses on 1 February .
The poll comes in the aftermath of Cruzâ€ ™ s successful appearance at the Presidential Family Forum in Des Moines last Friday , hosted by social conservative powerbroker Bob Vander Plaats .
The eventâ€ ™ s
moderator , top Republican pollster Frank Luntz , told the Guardian that Cruz â€œhad the biggest meeting after the session .
He was the most organized , most professional , doing this all step by step.â€ �
Luntz said the Texas senator deserved superlatives for every aspect of his performance : â€œIf there was a most , he had it.â€
�
Steve Deace , a well - connected conservative radio host and Cruz supporter , echoed Luntzâ€ ™ s praise of Cruzâ€ ™ s performance at the event .
But he noted that Cruz would have been in strong position regardless of how he had done at the event with â€œthe existing organization and support he had builtâ€ � .
To Deace , the one area where Cruz had been â€œa little bit
softâ€ � was in ardently conservative north - west Iowa .
However , the Texas senator had addressed that weakness when he secured the endorsement of congressman Steve King earlier in the month , Deace said .
King , a vocal opponent of illegal immigration , is wildly popular among Republicans in that part of the state and is considered to be the most influential conservative in the state .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t make Cruz inevitable yet .
Trump has built up a strong organization in the state and has more staffers on the ground there than any other Republican candidate .
The real estate mogul has drawn unprecedented crowds at events across the state and , with the exception of a two - week hiccup during Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s October surge in the state , has led in every poll since August .
Last week , King told reporters he would not rule out Trump winning on caucus night .
He said : â€œIf I had predicted Trumpâ€ ™ s ascendance , Iâ€ ™ d have more confidence in predicting his downfall.â€ �
But for all of Trumpâ€ ™ s staying power , his campaign seems to have reached a ceiling .
Deace compared Trump to former Texas congressman Ron Paul in that both candidates had â€œa high floor and a low ceilingâ€ � .
Deace thought Trumpâ€
™ s antics were â€œboth a good and a bad thingâ€ � .
â€œOn one hand , it produces a loyal following that is attracted to that persona which will not leave you .
On the other hand , it limits your ability to grow beyond that , â€ � he said .
This was borne out in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s poll , in which Cruz did better than any other Republican when respondents were asked which candidates they would definitely not support for the GOP nomination .
Only 5 % of respondents ruled out backing Cruz while 26 % said they would not back Trump .
Cruzâ€ ™ s advantage is that , while he is by no means an insider , he has managed to become the strongest candidate among party activists in both the evangelical and Tea Party factions of his party .
The Texas senatorâ€ ™
s campaign has now moved on to waging a quiet war with Rand Paulâ€ ™ s supporters over the small but influential libertarian wing of the GOP .
While Paul has held on to almost all of the key activists in Iowa who supported his father in 2012 , that support has not been reflected in his poll numbers .
Cruz has waged a steady appeal to more socially conservative libertarians who have not embraced Rand Paul in the same way that they backed his father , Ron , and he is attracting Republican regulars from different wings of the party .
In contrast , Trumpâ€ ™ s supporters are irregular voters at best .
Many of the crowds at his rallies may just be there for the celebrity experience â€ “ after all , while politicians visit quite frequently , itâ€ ™ s not often that a television star comes to Burlington , Iowa .
Even those most devoted to him have rarely participated in a caucus .
The typical supporter is someone like Phil Burnsmann of Fairley , Iowa , who camped for hours in August to see Trump appear in Dubuque .
He seemed befuddled when asked about the last time he had caucused .
â€œWhen Bush was in there , â€ �
Burnsmann haltingly told the Guardian .
Steve Rosanke , of Dubuque , said at the time : â€œI havenâ€
™ t been to a caucus for a while , that would be when I was in college , a few years back.â€ �
He added : â€œI always vote but I donâ€ ™ t always vote Republican.â€ �
The key challenge for the Trump campaign is to somehow convert these supporters into caucusgoers and lure them out for hours on a cold February night .
For now , Cruzâ€ ™ s
advantage is that he has a much easier task .
His supporters will be showing up on caucus night no matter what .
The Texas senator just has to make sure that they are staying in his corner .

2015-11-29,"Texas senator Ted Cruz has become the first Republican presidential candidate to directly address the fatal shooting of three people at Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado , calling the attack â€œhorrificâ€ � .
Speaking in Lamoni , Iowa , Cruz said that while the motives behind Fridayâ€ ™ s attack were not clear , â€œit was unacceptable , horrific and wrongâ€ � .
â€œWe know that police officers and civilians have been targeted and lost their lives and our prayers are right now are with the families , â€ � Cruz said .
Many of the partyâ€ ™ s candidates have come out strongly against Planned Parenthood on the campaign trail as they seek to secure conservative votes .
One police officer , Garrett Swasey , and two other civilians were killed and nine others were wounded in the attack .
The suspect Robert Lewis Dear , 57 , has been taken into custody .
Law enforcement was still investigating whether opposition to abortion motivated the attack on the Planned Parenthood clinic .
The non - profit group has been controversial in recent months after videos were released that purportedly showed the group selling fetal organs for profit .
Planned Parenthood has disputed the accuracy of those videos .
Cruz said : â€œI have spent much of my adult life working in law enforcement , working against murderers and those who commit violent crime , and that one officer who lost his life is particularly tragic.â€ �
Cruz became the first Republican presidential hopeful to address the attacks in person .
The Texas senator had previously tweeted about the attack earlier on Saturday .
In contrast , all three Democratic presidential candidates have issued statements about the attack , as has Barack Obama ."
2015-12-01,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has accused Democrats of inventing a so - called â€œcondom policeâ€ � as a means of scaring women into voting for them , spinning a question about access to birth control into a harangue about Hillary Clinton and â€œthe war on womenâ€ � .
â€œJiminy crickets , this is a made - up , nonsense example !
Last I checked we donâ€ ™ t have a rubber shortage in America , â€ �
Cruz told a crowd in Bettendorf , Iowa , on Monday .
He was asked by a voter about his position â€œon making contraception available for womenâ€ � , which he bridged into a long comment on accusations by Democrats that Republicans want to deny women contraceptives .
â€œLook , when I was in college we had a machine in the bathroom .
You put 50 cents in and voilÃ ,
â€ � the senator said to laughs .
â€œYes , anyone who wants contraceptives can access them , but itâ€ ™ s an utter made - up , nonsense issue.â€ � Reproductive rights and womenâ€ ™ s health have emerged as major campaign issues after months of debate over Planned Parenthood , which has been painted by some conservatives as dealing in fetal tissues for research .
Last week a gunman killed three people at a Planned Parenthood center in Colorado , allegedly telling police â€œno more baby partsâ€ � .
On Saturday , Cruz called the attack â€œunacceptable , horrific and wrongâ€ � no matter its intent , but said anti - abortion rhetoric should not take the blame for inspiring the attack .
â€œI am proud to be unambiguously pro - life to support protecting every human life , from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death , â€ �
he said a day later in Iowa .
He warned : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t fully know the motivations of this deranged individual.â€ �
But on Monday the Republican senator preferred a jocular tone , arguing that his party has never sought to keep contraceptives out of anyoneâ€ ™ s hands .
â€œI have never met anybody , any conservative , who wants to ban contraceptives .
As I noted , Heidi and I , we have two little girls ,
â€ �
he said , alluding to his wife and pausing for a beat .
â€œIâ€ ™ m very glad we donâ€ ™ t
have 17.â€ � Cruz has called for Congress to defund Planned Parenthood , which provides women with access to birth control and safe abortions as part of its range of reproductive services .
The organization and Democrats have also opposed a Republican - led bill that would allow women to buy birth control pills over the counter at pharmacies , arguing that such a measure would drive up the price of prescriptions which healthcare should cover .
In 2013 , Cruz called birth control pills â€œabortifacientsâ€ � , and as a senator has supported â€œreligious libertyâ€ � measures intended to protect private employers who would invoke religious beliefs so as not to pay for birth control , or who might take action against employees who use birth control or have had an abortion .
But accusations of a â€œwar on womenâ€ � are political theater , Cruz told the Iowa audience , staged to distract voters away from the flaws of the Democratic frontrunner , Clinton .
â€œSo what do you doâ€ � with a weak candidate , he asked the crowd .
â€œYou go , â€˜Aha , the condom police!â€ ™ â€
�
He neatly turned accusations familiar to far - right conservatives â€ “ for instance that Republicans are guilty of fearmongering over gun rights or refugees â€ “ back toward Democrats over womenâ€ ™ s health .
Clinton and others had resorted to the tactic out of desperation , he said : â€œIâ€ ™ m going to make up a completely made - up threat and try to scare a bunch of folks who are not paying a lot of attention into thinking someoneâ€ ™ s going to steal their birth control.â€ �"
2015-12-01,"Republican presidential candidates have poured scorn on Barack Obama for his comments at the Paris climate talks , with Mike Huckabee mocking him as the â€œmeteorologist - in - chiefâ€ � and Ted Cruz claiming Obama thinks â€œhaving an SUV in your drivewayâ€ � is more dangerous than Isis .
In a speech to more than 130 world leaders and other delegates at the key UN summit on Monday , the US president quoted Martin Luther King by saying â€œthere is such a thing as being too lateâ€ � .
â€œAnd when it comes to climate change , that hour is almost upon us , â€ � the US president said .
â€œBut if we act here , if we act now , if we place our own short - term interests behind the air that our young people will breathe , and the food that they will eat , and the water that they will drink , and the hopes and dreams that sustain their lives , then we wonâ€ ™ t be too late for them.â€ �
The threat of climate change â€œcould define the contours of this century more dramatically than any otherâ€ � , he added .
The presidentâ€ ™ s remarks were derided by Republicans , who accused him of failing to adequately recognise what they saw as the greater threat posed by Islamic militants .
Donald Trump , the GOP frontrunner in polls , said Obamaâ€ ™ s speech was â€œone of the dumbest things
Iâ€ ™ ve ever seen , or perhaps most naiveâ€ � .
â€œI think one of the dumbest statements Iâ€ ™ ve ever heard in politics , in the history of politics as I know it , which is pretty good , was Obamaâ€ ™ s statement that our No 1 problem is global warming ,
â€ �
Trump , who disputes the mainstream scientific understanding that human activity is warming the planet , told CNN .
Other Republicans vying for the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination weighed in , with Texas senator Cruz telling a gathering in Iowa that Obama â€œapparently thinks having an SUV in your driveway is more dangerous than a bunch of terrorists trying to blow up the worldâ€ � .
Huckabee , former governor of Arkansas , tweeted along similar lines , calling Obama â€œcluelessâ€ � and mocking him as â€œmeteorologist - in - chiefâ€ � .
Mitch McConnell , the US Senate majority leader , told the Senate that international leaders should be aware that there was more than one base of political power in the US and that Congress opposed Obamaâ€ ™ s
â€œregressive and likely illegalâ€ � regulations on power plants designed to slash their greenhouse gas emissions .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s currently trying to sell that power plan to world leaders in Paris as proof of the American governmentâ€ ™ s commitment to his energy priorities , â€ � McConnell said .
â€œBut with all due respect to the president as our commander - in - chief , governments currently engaged in this round of climate talks will want to know that there is more than just an executive branch in our system of government.â€ �
McConnell raised the possibility of a Republican successor to Obama tearing up the power plant plan , claiming that the regulations â€œcould result in the elimination of as many as a quarter of a million US jobsâ€ � without any significant impact upon world temperatures .
As expected , Congress approved two motions on Tuesday to overturn Obamaâ€ ™ s centrepiece emissions reduction policy , which uses the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce new limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants .
The move is expected to be symbolic as Obama has promised to veto the bills .
The votes went largely along party lines , although 10 Republicans sided with Democrats to oppose a motion that blocked emissions limits on new power plants .
Steve Scalise , Republican majority whip , said Obamaâ€ ™ s plan means â€œunelected bureaucrats at the EPA will bring forth regulations that will kill jobs in the US and increase energy and other costs on hardworking taxpayers.â€
�
The staunch opposition of Republicans is in contrast to the urgency expressed by a succession of international leaders over the need to tackle climate change .
Pope Francis added his voice to the political leaders on Monday , warning that the world was â€œat the limits of suicideâ€ � if nations did not ramp up efforts to reduce emissions .
Meanwhile , the World Food Programme warned that unchecked climate change , linked to extreme weather and prolonged droughts , risked leaving millions of people without reliable access to food .
Obama had a working dinner with the French president , FranÃ§ois Hollande , on Monday before meeting with leaders from small island nations on Tuesday morning .
The US president announced a $ 30 m package to help the island nations , which are particularly vulnerable to sea level rises and extreme weather , improve their climate resilience ."
2015-12-02,"Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz has condemned the growing wave of campus protests in the US as a product of â€œpampered teenagers who are scared of an idea that challenges their world viewâ€ � .
Speaking to the Guardian on a swing through Iowa , the 44-year - old Texas senator â€ “ increasingly seen as a potential unity candidate for Republicans â€ “ was disdainful of protesters who staged an occupation protest last month at his alma mater , Princeton .
Students have called for the Wilson School of Public and International Affairs on campus to be stripped of the name of two - term Democratic president Woodrow Wilson because of his racism and efforts to promote segregation in the federal workforce .
â€œI think it is more than a little ironic that the activities are targeting a leftist progressive Democrat like Woodrow Wilson , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œI am not a fan of Woodrow Wilson .
I think his policies did a great deal of damage to this country , but that being said I think the protesters at Princeton who are embracing this radical political correctness where they are claiming a right to be offended at anything they deem contrary to their vision of the world â€ “ that is completely antithetical to the mission of a university.â€ �
Wilson was a key figure in American political history , overseeing the creation of the Federal Reserve and leading the US in the first world war , but campus protesters have targeted his well - documented racism , which included firing many black government employees .
Cruz said : â€œWas Woodrow Wilson an unmitigated racist ?
Of course he was .
Should we denounce it and call it out for what it was ?
Yes .
But the idea that we should somehow be sanitizing our history because our ears are too fragile to recognize that the course of human existence has been a complicated course beset with human frailty â€ “ that undermines the entire purpose of a university.â€ �
In the wide - ranging interview with the Guardian , Cruz also declined to weigh in on efforts to implement a mandatory reporting system for police - involved shootings .
The federal government currently does not collect data on these incidents .
Through The Counted project , the Guardian has tallied more than 1,000 people killed by the police in the US .
FBI director James Comey has said it is â€œunacceptableâ€ � that the Guardian has better information on this subject than the federal government .
Cruz simply said : â€œI am a big defender of the first amendment and the rights of journalists to pursue stories , I think that is important , â€ � adding that tracking police - involved shootings was â€œthe Guardianâ€ ™ s prerogativeâ€ � .
He condemned what he called â€œa very problematic tendency under the Obama administration of vilifying police officersâ€ � and said â€œthere is absolutely a Ferguson effectâ€ � , linking the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement to rising crime rates in minority communities .
Cruz noted that Baltimore had a drastic increase in murders after the unrest following the death of Freddie Gray in April .
â€œAfter the riots there were 45 murders in the city of Baltimore in July .
It was the bloodiest month in Baltimore history since the 1970s , â€ � said Cruz .
â€œOf those 45 murders , 43 of those victims were African Americans , so you look at a movement like Black Lives Matter â€
“ of course
black lives matter â€ “ and what about those 43 African Americans who lost their lives to murders?â€
�
Cruz saw Democratic contempt for law enforcement as a phenomena that was not exclusive to the Obama administration .
He cited the December 2014 funeral â€œwhen the NYPD stood up and turned their backs on Mayor de Blasioâ€ � as â€œa moment that stood out and cut throughâ€ � .
On the question of Syrian refugees , Cruz , a vocal opponent of admitting any to the US , thought the solution was simple .
â€œAmerica needs to lead , â€ � he said .
â€œWe should destroy Isis .
That would go a long way towards ending this refugee crisis.â€ �
He insisted that the US could demonstrate that â€œwe are a compassionate and loving people who are responding to this crisisâ€ � without allowing any refugees to enter the country .
The Texas Republican also continued to refuse to criticize Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
Cruz connected Trump to the increased viewership of the televised presidential debates .
â€œI am very grateful for Donald Trump for bringing all those millions of extra eyeballs to the debate and giving people a chance to hear my message , â€ � he said .
Cruz also praised the real - estate mogul for â€œattracting so much energy and passion to the raceâ€ � .
However , Cruz said he felt the questioning about Trump was merely academic .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think Donald Trump is going to be the nominee , â€ � said Cruz .
â€œI like Donald , I respect Donald .
I donâ€
™ t believe he is going to be the nominee.â€ �
Instead , the Republican firebrand was convinced that it would be him leading the GOP in November 2016 ."
2015-12-02,"A conservative group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers and their wealthy allies boasts a scorecard on its website that rates the presidential candidates based on their opposition to policies meant to tackle climate change , such as EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions , a renewable fuels standard , and a tax credit that benefits wind energy .
Texas senator Ted Cruz scored the highest rating on the American Energy Alliance site , which labelled him a â€œheroâ€ � due in part to his opposition to regulation and taxes .
Cruz was followed on the scorecard by four other Republican candidates â€ “ Florida senator Marco Rubio , ex - Florida governor Jeb Bush , ex - Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who were named as â€œdefendersâ€ � .
Other GOP candidates , such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson , were labelled â€œdoubtersâ€ � , while Hillary Clinton and her Democratic rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley were bottom of the heap and branded â€œvillainsâ€ � .
As Republican presidential candidates compete to corral big checks from the industrialists Charles and David Koch and the 400-odd super - rich donors who support their political and advocacy network , the AEA scorecard is one of a number of tools that Koch - backed outfits are using to test the hopefulsâ€ ™ conservative credentials â€ “ and perhaps sway their stances â€ “ on major energy issues and other free market , small government priorities they support .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a public negotiation with these candidates to see which ones will be best on their pet issues , like climate change and environmental regulations , â€ � said one senior conservative operative .
Freedom Partners , the funding arm of the Koch network , and Americans for Prosperity , a leading political and advocacy group in the network , hosted separate multi - day gatherings in August which drew several candidates deemed strong on energy matters , plus slashing regulations and taxes .
The events drew Rubio , Cruz , Bush and a few other contenders who gave talks stressing their pro free enterprise bona fides .
The Koch networkâ€ ™ s intense political vetting process underscores the high stakes for candidates scrambling for six- and seven - figure checks for Super Pacs backing their campaigns , as well as scores of donors seeking the strongest candidate to implement their deregulatory climate - change skeptical and low tax agendas .
Super Pacs sprang up after the supreme court overturned decades of campaign finance law in 2010 and allowed corporations , individuals and unions to give unlimited sums to ostensibly independent groups promoting federal candidates .
With two months to go before the first primaries , Charles and David Koch have given mixed signals about their plans .
In April , Charles Koch told USA Today that he and his brother might back more than one candidate in the primaries , suggesting that if â€œthey want our support , one way to get it is to articulate a good messageâ€ � on certain policies .
But in late November , in another USA Today interview , he took another tack .
â€œI have no plans to support anyone in the primaries now , â€ � he said , leaving himself some wiggle room but surprising some donors and fellow conservatives .
â€œMy view is that [ Charles Koch ] is trying to set up an advocacy competition between the major candidates for the support of network donors , â€ � said former House majority leader Dick Armey , who after he left Congress spent about two years chairing a now defunct Koch - backed lobbying group .
â€œAnybody who wants to get enthusiastic support from the Kochs is going to have to show real enthusiasm on the climate issue.â€ �
The Koch brothers , whose combined net worth is close to $ 88bn , derive their fortunes from Koch Industries , the energy and industrial giant they control .
The brothers and their donor network have long fought climate change regulations and several other high - profile EPA rules for a mix of ideological and business reasons , say some conservatives .
Charles Koch has strongly rejected the idea that his political and advocacy efforts are driven by bottom - line concerns .
While the Koch brothers remain coy about their candidate preferences , a number of billionaire donors in the Koch network , including hedge fund chieftains Paul Singer and Robert Mercer , have either made large donations to Super Pacs supporting candidates , or are expected to do so .
Rubio , who reportedly won a straw poll of some conference donors at a Freedom Partners event in January , and Cruz for now seem to have an edge among network donors .
Singer in October sent an enthusiastic letter to scores of big conservative donors â€ “ including a number in the Koch orbit â€ “ endorsing Rubio .
Singer is slated to host a large campaign fundraiser for the senator in New York this month , and is expected to write a big check â€ “ and raise money from others â€ “ for a pro - Rubio Super Pac .
And Mercer has already plowed a whopping $ 11 m into one of four Super Pacs supporting Cruz .
Overall , the Koch network plans to spend $ 750 m in 2016 on direct political activity and issue advocacy .
The political spending is expected to total about $ 300 m in the general election .
Besides prodding GOP candidates , several Koch - funded advocacy groups are engaged in aggressive energy lobbying drives at both the federal and state levels targeting EPA regulations of carbon emissions from power plants , efforts to expand wind and solar power usage via tax incentives , and the climate change accords currently under discussion in Paris .
The multi - front lobbying battles are being waged by several Koch backed groups , such as Americans for Prosperity and the American Energy Alliance .
Tom Pyle , a former lobbyist for Koch Industries , runs the American Energy Alliance .
The two groups are also working to lift the ban on oil exports and to end funding for the US governmentâ€ ™ s Export - Import Bank , which they deem an example of â€œcrony capitalismâ€ � .
Currently , Americans for Prosperity , the American Energy Alliance and a few other nonprofits backed by the Koch network are embroiled in a big fight in Florida over a pro - solar ballot initiative in 2016 which , if passed , would expand solar power usage in the Sunshine State .
Charles Koch , in an interview with the Washington Post at the Freedom Partners donor retreat in August , raised alarms about the impact of climate change regulations on the economy , a point echoed by some GOP candidates .
In the interview , Koch asked : â€œDo we want to create a catastrophe today in the economy because of some speculation based on models
that donâ€ ™ t work?â€
�
But some veteran oil industry lobbyists say that such economic arguments are often overblown .
â€œIf
I believed all the predictions that the economy was going to hell because of new regulations , the industry would have declared Chapter 11 many times , â€ � said Don Duncan , a former top lobbyist for ConocoPhillips ."
2015-12-02,"Ted Cruz idolizes Ronald Reagan .
The Republican presidential hopeful has read dozens of biographies of the 40th president and invokes his name at every campaign stop .
In fact , Cruz discusses Reaganâ€ ™ s victory in the 1980 general election so often that a casual listener might think the Texas senator is preparing himself to run against Jimmy Carter and not Hillary Clinton .
But thereâ€ ™ s one other modern president whom Cruz deeply admires â€ “ and itâ€ ™ s not a Republican .
In a wide - ranging interview with the Guardian , the first - term senator - in - a - hurry revealed that his push for the White House is based not only on the vision of Reagan , but the tactics of Barack Obama .
He deplores the direction Obama has taken at home and abroad , but praises him as someone who has â€œdemonstrated real courageâ€ � in fighting for his principles .
And his admiration for the â€œpotentâ€ � Obama election machine is so great he admits buying copies of Democratic campaign manager
David Plouffeâ€ ™ s memoirs to hand out to his own staff during his successful 2012 Senate race .
â€œObama ran a masterful campaign .
It was a grassroots guerilla campaign , encircled the Hillary campaign before they knew what hit them , â€ � the Texas senator said .
Like Obama , he is now ready to take on the party establishment as something of an insurgent .
The difference is that Cruz hopes to use those same tactics to reverse every major accomplishment of the Obama administration while returning to what he sees as â€œcommon sense
valuesâ€ � .
The 44-year - old Cuban - American is increasingly seen as a potential unity candidate for Republicans who see themselves as either outsiders , libertarians or deeply conservative evangelicals .
On a three - day swing across Iowa , plenty of Republicans were receptive to Cruzâ€ ™ s message as he drew big crowds in the smallest of towns .
His campaign hoped to hold whistle - stop events at small - town gas stations where he could mingle with one or two dozen voters .
Instead , he packed every stop , forcing inquisitive crowds to cram the aisles between refrigerated cases of soda and long links of beef jerky .
In the town of Van Horne , Iowa ( population 671 ) , Cruz drew more than 100 people at a Sunday night stop at the town gas station .
The night before , he had drawn more than 50 to a gas station in Chariton , Iowa at 10 pm on a Saturday .
However , one attendee told Cruz he shouldnâ€ ™ t be too impressed with the crowd â€ “ after all , there was nothing else going on in Chariton on a Saturday night .
In Newton , Iowa , a town of 15,000 , he drew the biggest crowd to a political event at Pizza Ranch , a local chain that is invariably visited by Republican candidates , ever since Rick Santorum visited on the eve of 2012 victory in the Iowa caucuses .
He didnâ€ ™ t limit himself to politics .
Cruz is a self - described â€œhappy warriorâ€ � , borrowing Wordsworthâ€ ™ s immortal line for Lord Nelson , given modern American political gloss by Reagan when he exhorted supporters three decades ago to â€œseize back a countryâ€ � .
Cruz trotted out a series of jokes at every event at the expense of targets like Obama , Hillary Clinton and government bureaucrats which invariably met with laughter , both from the audience and Cruz .
The noted movie buff even performed an entire scene from the 1987 movie The Princess Bride , imitating every character while speaking at an evangelical church service on Sunday morning in Des Moines .
Yet the outspoken conservative wasnâ€ ™ t all sunshine and jokes .
In huddles with reporters across the weekend , Cruz took shots at Republican rival Marco Rubio for making â€œbogus attacksâ€ � on him and noted Rubioâ€ ™ s support of comprehensive immigration reform , or , as the Texas senator called it , Rubioâ€ ™ s â€œlongtime partnership with and collaboration with President Obama ... in pushing a massive amnesty planâ€ � .
The Republican hopeful also is not shy about tossing out red meat for his social conservative base .
On Monday , Cruz cast scorn on the idea that Republicans were trying to reduce access to contraception , telling a questioner : â€œJiminy Crickets , this is a made - up , nonsense example !
Last I checked , we donâ€ ™ t have a rubber shortage in America.â€ �
He then reminisced about the condom machine in his college dorm bathroom .
For Cruz , who insists that he follows Reaganâ€ ™ s famous 11th commandment , â€œThou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republicanâ€ � , it was a delicate balance between â€œhappy warriorâ€ � and aggressive politician .
Speaking to the Guardian , he challenged the conventional wisdom that he was â€œthe snarling face of the angry rightâ€ � , a phrase used by one liberal presenter that the Texas Republican recited from memory .
â€œMany in the media like to characterize me and other conservatives as far right and extreme .
And I think thatâ€ ™ s all nonsense .
The principles I am fighting for â€ “ live within your means ,
donâ€ ™ t bankrupt your kids and grandkids
, follow the constitution â€ “ are the essence of common sense .
They are the principles every small town , small business , families in this country have understood for hundreds of years .
â€œReagan got that .
He got that simply giving voice to values of American people has power , and speaking the truth with a smile has enormous potency .
Itâ€ ™ s what Reagan did every day and what Iâ€ ™ m trying to do in this campaign.â€ �
Yet Cruz , described by Senate colleague John McCain as a â€œwackobirdâ€ � , has made a surplus of enemies in Washington .
He is widely disliked by many colleagues who see him as an unprincipled showboater .
Cruzâ€ ™ s role in instigating a 17-day - long government shutdown in October 2013 is considered a deep source of frustration .
Fellow Republicans thought that the shutdown , with the stated goal of forcing Obama to sign a bill defunding Obamacare , was doomed to fail .
But it burnished Cruzâ€ ™ s reputation with the conservative grassroots .
In campaign stops , the Texas Republican tried to use his unpopularity in Washington DC as an asset .
â€œIf you see a candidate who Washington embraces , run and hide , â€ � he repeatedly told voters .
Cut from the same cloth Despite their differing political outlooks , Cruz and Obama have similar life stories .
Both Harvard Law graduates with undergraduate degrees from Ivy League schools , they grew up in complicated family circumstances .
Obama was raised mostly by his grandparents after his Kenyan - born father abandoned his family in infancy , although he spent several years in his youth with his mother and stepfather in Indonesia .
Cruz was born in Canada in 1971 , where his father , a Cuban refugee , had moved with his American - born mother to work in the oil and gas industry .
Cruzâ€ ™ s father left the family before becoming Christian and returning .
Obamaâ€ ™ s dash for the presidency is well - known ; Cruzâ€ ™ s rise was almost as sudden .
Although long seen as a rising star in conservative circles , Cruz was a long shot in his bid for a Senate seat in 2012 , but he upset an establishment - backed rival with a dash to the right .
With his Latino heritage and solid conservative credentials , Cruz was immediately labeled a figure to watch and almost as quickly started to lay the groundwork for a potential presidential bid , appearing at Iowa cattle calls within months of his election .
Cruz and Obama do not just have biographical similarities : they also share a similar view of Reagan as a transformational figure .
Obama said in a 2008 interview : â€œRonald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not , and a way that Bill Clinton did not ...
He tapped into what people were already feeling , which was , â€˜We want clarity , we want optimism.â€ ™ â€ �
Cruz praised Obamaâ€ ™ s Reagan - like sense of purpose : â€œIf you look at the Reagan administration , one of the ways they implemented a conservative vision that really changed the direction of this country in a policy manner is that people were put in place who shared common ideals and understood the presidentâ€ ™ s principles and were prepared to implement him .
â€œTo his credit , Barack Obama has done the same thing .
There are some in the political world that vilify Barack Obama .
Personally , Iâ€ ™ ve never been one of them .
I think he is deeply committed to his principles and demonstrated real courage in fighting for them.â€ �
The Texas senator has pledged that , if elected , heâ€ ™ ll repeal the Obamacare health insurance reforms , abolish the IRS tax collection agency and four different cabinet departments , and defeat Islamic State while ending illegal immigration by totally securing the US border with Mexico .
It is a drastically conservative view that would attempt to fundamentally change the role of government in American life , a view perhaps epitomized by a joke Cruz makes at every campaign stop about using pesticide on government bureaucrats .
But where Obamaâ€ ™ s efforts have hit roadblocks in office , Cruz thought he could get around them .
In the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s opinion , â€œthere is a limit to Obamaâ€ ™ s model that although he organized from the grassroots , the policies that he is pushing , I think , are contrary to the views and values of the American people , and so it becomes harder to energize and mobilize the grassrootsâ€ � .
In contrast , Cruz said he was confident that his principles were â€œthe essence of common senseâ€ � .
This vision resonated with many of those who came out to see Cruz , such as Carson Haring , from Cambria , Iowa , who drove 17 miles with four of his children to see thesenator at 10 pm on a Saturday night .
Haring told the Guardian that Cruz was â€œthe first presidential candidate to remind me of Ronald Reagan in all these
yearsâ€ � .
He said he thought both shared in a belief â€œthat the constitution comes firstâ€ � .
Others were more skeptical , but Cruz as always invoked Reagan to ease fears .
In a tiny restaurant in Lenox , Iowa , a town of just over 1,000 people and no traffic lights , the hopeful again summoned the 40th president to show that his promises were not delusional .
â€œImagine all of us were sitting here
, it was 1979 , and imagine the former governor of California walked in and we sat down and listened to him , â€ �
Cruz told attendees .
â€œImagine if Reagan stood up and said :
â€˜If you elect me president , we will cut the top marginal tax rate from 70 % to 28 % , we will dramatically reduce regulations killing small businesses .
We will go from economic stagnation to by the fourth year of my presidency ... booming economic growth , millions will be lifted out of poverty .
In addition to that , Iran will release the hostages the day I am sworn into office , and within a decade we will win the cold war and tear the Berlin Wall to the ground.â€ ™ â€œNow , sir , if you and I , or any of us sitting there listening to Ronald Reagan in 1979 say that , we would have said , â€˜This guy is bark - at - the - moon crazy , you can not do thatâ€ ™ ...
You would have said this man does not understand Washington and politics.â€ � Snarling face of the right or bark - at - the - moon crazy , Cruz rejects both labels and sees himself as the next president of the United States .
If Barack Obama can do it from the left , he believes he can do it from the right , with a grassroots army of his own .

2015-12-02,"Black university students are recognizing that they share a common struggle : they can not merely navigate universities that are white - created , led and dominated , be it culturally , economically , politically , demographically or epistemologically .
Instead , they face additional pressure to be excellent in , and to change , spaces that were not created for their benefit .
So when Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz condemned the growing wave of campus protests â€ “ including at his alma mater , Princeton â€ “ in a Guardian interview Tuesday as a product of â€œpampered teenagers who are scared of an idea that challenges their world
viewâ€ �
, he completely missed the point .
Renaming buildings at Georgetown or Princeton , or altering the Harvard crest , isnâ€ ™ t some overzealous request for a safe space , but rather the equivalent of cutting the heart out of the body of white supremacy .
Itâ€ ™ s important that the old system be no longer be celebrated , and itâ€ ™ s important that , in the process of articulating why we are bringing down the symbol , we dig up the dark history of it , to degrade the symbol publicly and to expose the truth behind it so the university can no longer be proud of it .
The short - term wins from this fallâ€ ™ s nationwide campus protests are positive .
Students at more than 60 schools have posted their demands online , and people are listening : administrators have resigned ; diversity task forces have been created .
This has all certainly brought a form of moral reparation and recognition of dignity .
But itâ€ ™ s mostly involved tearing down monstrosities .
The mid - range goals for more black faculty and new safe spaces are necessary â€ “ although as a black professor , let me be clear : just as a black cop , or a black president , can end up administering an anti - black state , even if they themselves are not anti - black , black professors and black university presidents can administer anti - black classrooms and universities .
But it is implementing an alternative vision of these elite institutions , a new vision that goes beneath the surface to the structure , that is worth putting oneâ€ ™ s body on the line for : we can not stop until we replace the defiled value system of white supremacy that these institutions have embodied .
It shouldnâ€ ™ t be surprising that students are working together , nationwide , to do so .
Many of the same youth who took the streets to protest racist state violence have taken to the campus to protest racial hostility in the Ivory tower .
As Robin Kelly noted in Freedom Dreams : The Black Radical Imagination , voices of resistance throughout the black world often erupt out of collective social movements and overlap .
But beyond the injuries of protest , black students bear the weight of the theoretical work of unravelling the thread of the intellectual project .
Black students must continue to protest , but they also must continue to re - theorize the structure and values of the academy , globally , in the 21st century .
Black students must continue to question the foundations of their schools .
Who decides the curriculum ?
Who teaches ?
Who are the buildings named after ?
Who has final say over the budget ?
Who brings in guest speakers ?
The protests , and the responses , need to close the gap between the principles that these institutions espouse to students , parents and alumni , and the reality that they impose on students and faculty .
Only through the practice of questioning the status quo can students truly say that they are placing their hard - won theoretical knowledge at the service of the people â€ “ as all activist intellectuals aspire to do .
The utter destruction of icons of white supremacy is of paramount importance .
It is painful to remember these histories , but like heroes , the students must go through a type of hell first before getting their win .
Then the systems can be restructured more thoroughly .
In The Wretched of the Earth ( better translated from the French as the â€œcondemnedâ€ � of the earth ) , Frantz Fanon speaks about the â€œgrandeur and weakness of spontaneityâ€ � , which is the inclination of colonized intellectuals to fail to organize a rebellion , fail to introduce the people to a radical agenda and fail to engage in sustained public education so that the struggle can continue to elevate .
For the black youth movement to reach its goal of sustained structural change , it will need to eventually go beyond local campus demands .
As Robin Kelly reminded us : â€œWithout new vision , we donâ€ ™ t know what to build , only what to knock down.â€ �
Students , with time and intellectual capacity , can lead the way on this .
In decolonization , there can be no self - weakening â€
“ no compromise whatsoever .
To allow such compromise is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the threat that white supremacy still holds for people of color .
Racial violence is ensconced deeply into the DNA of the institutions that we seek to dismantle and rebuild anew , so every single detail of these institutions has to be rethought .
It takes more resources than we will have at our fingertips alone ."
2015-12-02,"Support for Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s bid to be the Republican presidential nominee has faded , according to a poll released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University .
The poll , which was conducted after the terror attacks on Paris , from 23 - 30 November , showed Carson tied in third place with Texas senator Ted Cruz , both attracting 16 % of Republican voters .
A poll by the same company last month had Carson in second place on 23 % .
Donald Trump , meanwhile , solidified his frontrunner status with 27 % of voters , while Florida senator Marco Rubio attracted 17 % .
However , Trump remains the more divisive candidate : when respondents were asked if there were any candidates they definitely would not vote for , 26 % of respondents selected Trump but only 5 % ruled out Rubio .
Hillary Clinton also widened her lead in the Democrat race by a further 12 percentage points .
A total of 60 % of respondents who identified as Democrat or Democratic leaning said that if the primary were to be held today , they would vote for Clinton , while 30 % said the same about Vermont senator Bernie Sanders .
Last month in a poll by the same university , Clinton had 53 % of support and Sanders was at 35 % .
The 72-question telephone survey , conducted among registered voters by one of the more accurate political pollsters , also asked about specific voting concerns and uncovers a revealing shift in priorities .
Republican voters showed more interest in foreign policy and terrorism compared to a month ago .
Given that Carson has struggled to grasp foreign policy , changing voter concerns might well explain the candidateâ€ ™ s fall in support .
When asked to name the issue they considered most important in determining their vote for the Republican nomination , 26 % said the economy and jobs ( 35 % said the same last month ) , 24 % said terrorism ( previously 11 % ) and 17 % said foreign policy ( also previously 11 % ) .
The poll showed a clear difference between the stated priorities of Republican and Democratic voters .
Less than 1 % of Republicans said climate change was a key concern , compared to 8 % of Democrats .
The No 1 concern among Democrats was also the economy and jobs
â€ “
but by a clearer margin , well ahead of foreign policy and terrorism .
Neither Democrats nor Republicans expressed a strong concern about gun policy or abortion when choosing a candidate â€ “ both topics were chosen by less than 5 % of respondents .
Responses about current voter concerns provide more accurate numbers than responses about voting intention at the general election in 11 monthsâ€ ™ time .
An Ipsos analysis of 300 polls showed that there is an eight - point margin of error on average when polls are conducted a year before an election .
Even less reliable are responses about hypothetical scenarios about the presidential election which the interviewers described to respondents .
Those numbers suggest that a race fought between Clinton and Rubio would be closer than one fought between Clinton and Trump .
Below are the responses based on the various scenarios they suggested to respondents : In a race that is ... Clinton v Carson : 46 % to 43 % Clinton v Trump : 47 % to 41 % Clinton v Rubio : 45 % to 44 % Clinton v Cruz : 47 % to 42 % Sanders v Carson : 47 % to 41 % Sanders v Trump : 49 % to 41 % Sanders v Rubio : 44 % to 43 % Sanders v Cruz : 49 % to 39 %
The Quinnipiac University survey of 1,453 registered voters nationwide has a margin of error of + /-
2.6 percentage points .
The poll included 672 Republican or Republican - leaning voters and 573 Democratic or Democratic - leaning voters ."
2015-12-04,"A day after 14 people were killed in the mass shooting in San Bernardino , California , all four Republican presidential candidates in the US Senate â€ “ Ted Cruz , Lindsey Graham , Rand Paul and Marco Rubio â€
“ opposed a measure that would introduce tighter gun laws .
They were among Republicans who overwhelmingly voted down a gun control measure that would extend FBI background checks on every firearms purchase .
Only four of the 54 Republican senators voted on Thursday in favour of applying the checks to currently unregulated sales of firearms online and at gun shows .
Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania , who co - sponsored a similar failed attempt at gun reform in the wake of the December 2012 massacre in Newtown , Connecticut , was joined in supporting the tighter restrictions by fellow GOP senators Susan Collins of Maine , Mark Kirk of Illinois and John McCain of Arizona .
But they were the only four Republicans to do so .
The almost blanket opposition to greater gun controls â€ “ even in the wake of the bloodiest mass shooting since Newtown â€ “ underlined the hardline position that the Republican party has come to adopt over the second amendment .
A second gun control effort by Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein suffered a similar fate , voted down by a solid Republican bloc giving 54 votes to 45 .
It would have removed one of the most glaring anomalies of current US gun laws whereby individuals who are listed on the stateâ€ ™ s terror watchlist â€ “ and forbidden from flying as a result â€ “ are nonetheless able to buy lethal firearms .
Both measures were introduced by the Democrats as a means of casting light on the almost rock - solid hostility of the modern Republican party to gun controls despite the rash of recent mass shootings .
It was not always like that .
Ronald Reagan , a figure of worship for many modern conservatives , was far more amenable to the idea of intervention to reduce the carnage .
The late president , also a former governor of California , was profoundly influenced in his thinking on firearms by the assassination attempt on his life in 1981 that injured him and left his press secretary Jim Brady paralyzed .
Brady went on to found the leading gun control advocacy group in the country , the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence .
Reagan himself , on leaving office in 1989 , added his considerable political weight to key pieces of gun control legislation .
In 1991 he wrote an article for the New York Times titled â€œWhy Iâ€ ™ m for the Brady billâ€ � in which he explained why he supported a new provision â€ “ named after Jim Brady â€ “ that forced gun buyers to wait seven days before acquiring a firearm , giving time for background checks by local police .
â€œEvery year an average of 9,200 Americans are murdered by handguns , â€ � Reagan said .
â€œThis level of violence must be stopped .
If the passage of the Brady bill were to result in a reduction of only 10 - 15 % of those numbers ( and it could be a good deal greater ) , it would be well worth making it the law of the land.â€ �
Three years later Reagan joined fellow former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford in writing a letter to the Boston Globe in which they backed a ban on assault rifles .
â€œWhile we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime , statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns , making them less accessible to criminals , â€ � the presidents wrote .
It is not coincidental that the shift from Reaganâ€ ™ s relatively moderate stance on guns to the Republican partyâ€ ™ s hard line today is mirrored by an identical trajectory shown by the NRA .
As Adam Winkler of UCLA has shown , the NRA in the 1920s and 30s was a leading proponent of gun control laws .
The lobby group pioneered legislation that banned the concealed carrying of handguns in public places without police permission .
It also backed the introduction of permits that only granted firearms to individuals who could show a â€œproper reason for carryingâ€ � .
Josh Sugarmann , executive director of the Violence Policy Center and an authority on the NRA , said the groupâ€ ™ s moderate position came to an abrupt end in 1977 when it sharply changed tack under the leadership of Harlon Carter .
â€œFrom then on the NRA dropped its focus on sporting activities and concentrated primarily on politics , â€ � Sugarmann said .
Over the past 20 years the NRA and the Republican party have moved in concert towards increasingly rigid policies opposing any gun controls .
Their combined strength has seen the rolling back of even the meagre regulations that were in place , including the lapsing in 2004 of the assault weapons ban that Reagan had supported .
The NRA and its GOP allies in Congress have similarly consistently blocked any attempt to end the situation in which individuals on the terror watchlist are allowed to buy guns .
As a result , as the Washington Post has pointed out , in the 10 years up to 2014 suspected terrorists attempted to buy firearms in the US at least 2,233 times .
Given this solid wall of opposition , signs of compromise on the right are extremely few and far between .
But there was one such opening on Thursday when the former GOP congressman who was seminal in introducing an NRA - fostered ban on federal research into gun violence announced he now wants to see the prohibition lifted .
Jay Dickey , a former US House representative from Arkansas , called for the scrapping of his 1996 amendment that banned the federal agency the Centers for Disease Control from engaging in research aimed at reducing gun deaths .
Hours after the San Bernardino rampage
Dickey wrote in a public letter : â€œDoing nothing is no longer an acceptable solution.â€ � Having recently expressed his regrets about the legislation he championed , Dickey went further and argued that from now on the CDC should be allowed to conduct research designed to reduce gun violence .
Dickey cited its other important work in investigating how to cut fatalities from car crashes .
â€œResearch could have been continued on gun violence without infringing on the rights of gun owners , in the same fashion that the highway industry continued its research without eliminating the automobile ,
â€ �
Dickey said .
In addition to voting against the gun reform measure in the Senate , one of the Republican presidential candidates â€ “ Paul , who is senator for Kentucky â€ “ introduced an amendment to allow the federal government to essentially override the District of Columbiaâ€ ™ s strict gun control laws .
It failed to achieve the necessary 60-vote supermajority to advance and failed by a margin of 54 - 46 .
Meanwhile , Cruz , who represents Texas , and is currently considered among the frontrunners in the Republican race for the White House , announced his campaign would be holding a â€œsecond Amendment eventâ€ � at a gun store in suburban Des Moines on Friday ."
2015-12-06,"The US woke up on Friday to the news that Donald Trump was a full 20 percentage points ahead of Ted Cruz , his nearest rival , for the Republican nomination , and a good 16 percentage points higher than Americaâ€ ™ s top political analysts thought he would be .
Running on a platform of â€œmaking America great
againâ€ � , his campaign has been noteworthy for Trumpâ€ ™ s egregious widespread insults and total fabrications , on a gargantuan scale .
The most recent of which was him claiming to have seen â€œthousands of Muslimsâ€ � dancing in the streets of New Jersey after 9/11 .
No evidence exists of this , because it never happened .
Almost as disturbing to the media as the fact that you can build a successful campaign on fantasy has been the lack of spent advertising dollars .
In fascinating figures released by NBC News , Donald Trump has so far spent a mere $ 217,000 on broadcast advertising , compared to the eye - watering $ 28.9 m spent by Jeb Bush , currently languishing at 3 % of the poll compared with Trumpâ€ ™ s 36 % .
Trump is allowing the evolved ecology of TV coverage and the new power of the social web do the work for him , live tweeting along the way .
The Trump campaign has so far become as absorbing and troubling for media critics as it has for his rivals .
As NYU Professor and media critic Jay Rosen put it , â€œuntangling the MÃ¶bius strip of Trump coverageâ€
� feeds the campaign itself .
Media theorist Douglas Rushkoff wrote that he was re - evaluating his initial belief that the internet would deliver its own truth serum : â€œOn the internet , information streams can be isolated , almost meaninglessly decontextualised triggers â€ “ or , worse , as elements in a feed algorithmically configured by a social media platform to keep users clicking and spreading.â€ � Rushkoff hits on something here , which social platforms and search engines are themselves struggling with : should you privilege facts over feelings ?
In the past few weeks I have travelled around America , east coast , west coast and parts in between , sitting in different rooms listening to technologists and journalists chew over how to make information on the internet , and specifically on social platforms deliver â€œhigher quality news and informationâ€ � .
In one room a senior executive at a social media company said that serving the stakeholders of â€œusers and Wall Streetâ€ � would force â€œbetter quality informationâ€ � to be highlighted .
This is patently not true .
Wall Street only cares about higher revenues and users like to be entertained even more than they like to be informed .
This is the tabloid dilemma writ large .
A well respected journalist and chief executive of a Pulitzer winning news site made the point at another meeting that , despite consistently and meticulously producing original reporting on important issues relevant to a wide range of people , his organisationâ€ ™ s work was never favoured by search or social platforms over more eye - catching but erroneous content .
Google is investing in tools to help bring more facts to the fore and backing projects to build â€œtrust in mediaâ€ � , Facebook and Twitter talk openly about wanting to promote higher quality information through better curation or algorithms .
However the point Rushkoff makes is the right one : the quest for â€œsharingâ€ � , â€œlikesâ€ � and opinion favours feelings over facts every time .
Digitally native outlets themselves fashion headlines of the â€œyouâ€ ™ ll never guess â€ ¦
â€ � nature to engage Generation Swipe Left ( or millennials as they are more often known ) .
The question then that we ought to be asking is : â€œWhat is Facebook ( or your social platform of choice ) going to do about Donald Trump?â€ � .
When it is possible to remove all traces of a campaign claim which is completely untrue , and demonstrably so , by building verifiability into the algorithm , will social platforms and search engines go ahead and do it ?
It is the same question that Arthur Brisbane , the former public editor of the New York Times , wrote in a column asking if journalists ought to be â€œtruth
vigilantesâ€ � .
What he meant was , should reporters report something even if they know it to be false ?
Brisbane was rather taken apart by his audience , who were sure journalists ought to be truth vigilantes .
However , the new layer of emotion and engagement , empathy and feeling that we are now invited to apply to information by the social web actually relegates complexity and truth below feelings and opinion .
These are not societal constructs either , but rather commercial .
Embedding material in the social web , or creating a virtual reality presentation of it , or a comedy show around it , creates a new relationship with information , more vivid and meaningful than a plain account of the event .
The liberals can relax about Trump for now , as there is not yet any real danger of him being elected president .
The questions raised by the mechanics of his campaign , however , and what it means for the future of news , are going to be with us for some time to come ."
2015-12-10,"Ted Cruz has launched a stinging attack on fellow Republicans who have demanded the return of mass telephone surveillance in the wake of the San Bernardino terrorist attack .
The Texas senator , who is surging in the 2016 polls by running as the most conservative candidate in the race , has rejected the calls from many in his own party who believe the Paris and California attacks are grounds for a return to the controversial bulk data collection techniques revealed by Edward Snowden .
Demands have grown in recent days from national security hawks , but Cruz said the techniques outlawed during recent reforms of the National Security Agency had failed to detect the plotters behind the San Bernardino shooting .
As new information emerges from the FBI suggesting the husband and wife shooters were radicalised up to two years earlier and may have been plotting other attacks , Cruz argued that blanket surveillance had proven to be counter - productive in spotting potential Islamic extremists operating in the US .
â€œOn
the right
, there are some who have called for resurrecting the government bulk data collection that existed under the Patriot Act [ but ] more data from millions of law abiding Americans is not always better data , â€ � Cruz said , in a major national security speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .
â€œHoarding tens of billions of records of ordinary citizens did not stop Fort Hood , it didnâ€
™ t stop Boston , it didnâ€ ™ t stop Chattanooga , it didnâ€ ™ t stop Garland
and it failed to detect the San Bernardino plotters , â€ � he added .
Cruz was a co - sponsor of the USA Freedom Act , which replaced lapsed authority under the Patriot Act and now forces authorities to demand specific data from phone companies instead of collecting all of it and storing it in government databases .
Though the reforms received widespread bipartisan support at the time they passed Congress and are supported by the White House , a backlash has grown in recent weeks , with figures such as CIA director John Brennan criticising â€œhand - wringingâ€ � over surveillance .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul â€ “ who has campaigned on libertarian grounds against the invasion of privacy of millions of Americans
â€ “ has also attempted to hold the line in the face of the renewed criticism , accusing hawks such as presidential rival Chris Christie of demanding Americans â€œgive up their liberty for a false sense of securityâ€ � .
â€œWhat Snowden revealed is we were collecting all of Verizonâ€ ™
s records on all Americans , â€ � Paul told MSNBC earlier this week .
â€œI think
itâ€ ™ s actually made us less safe because I think the haystack is so large that weâ€ ™ re getting lost in the haystack.â€ �
But Paul has made little headway in the crowded Republican primary and the fresh support from Cruz , who recently overtook Donald Trump in polling in Iowa , threatens to catapult the libertarian issue back to the top of the party debate .
â€œWhen the focus of law enforcement and national security is on ordinary citizens rather than targeting the bad guy , we miss the bad guys while violating the constitutional rights of American citizens , â€ � said Cruz on Thursday .
â€œInstead the bulk data programme was emblematic of the bureaucratic tendency to gather more not better information , which gives government tremendous opportunity for abuse ,
â€ � he added .
â€œLike
the fable of the scorpion and the frog , government will do what is in its nature : amass power at the expense of people.â€ �
Both Cruz and Paul argue that their bill makes it easier for the NSA to target specific suspects .
â€œUnder the old bulk data programme , all of us were presumed guilty at the outset and yet the universe of phone records that could be searched was materially smaller than under the USA Freedom Act , â€ � said the Texas senator .
â€œWe should not shy away from smarter policies.â€ �
His intervention came as politicians on both sides of Congress were receiving new classified security briefings on the San Bernardino shootings ."
2015-12-11,"Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s presidential campaign is using psychological data based on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users , harvested largely without their permission , to boost his surging White House run and gain an edge over Donald Trump and other Republican rivals , the Guardian can reveal .
A little - known data company , now embedded within Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign and indirectly financed by his primary billionaire benefactor , paid researchers at Cambridge University to gather detailed psychological profiles about the US electorate using a massive pool of mainly unwitting US Facebook users built with an online survey .
As part of an aggressive new voter - targeting operation , Cambridge Analytica â€ “ financially supported by reclusive hedge fund magnate and leading Republican donor Robert Mercer â€ “ is now using so - called â€œpsychographic profilesâ€ � of US citizens in order to help win Cruz votes , despite earlier concerns and red flags from potential survey - takers .
Documents seen by the Guardian have uncovered longstanding ethical and privacy issues about the way academics hoovered up personal data by accessing a vast set of US Facebook profiles , in order to build sophisticated models of usersâ€ ™ personalities without their knowledge .
In the race to advance data - driven electioneering strategies pioneered by successive Obama campaigns , Cruz has turned to Cambridge Analytica for its unparalleled offering of psychological data based on a treasure trove of Facebook â€œlikesâ€ � , allowing it to match individualsâ€ ™ traits with existing voter datasets , such as who owned a gun .
Analysis of Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) filings shows Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has paid Cambridge Analytica at least $ 750,000 this year .
The â€œbehavioural microtargetingâ€ � company has also received around $ 2.5 m over the past two years from conservative Super Pacs to which Mercer or members of his family have donated .
In an interview with the Guardian last month , Cruz said his funding and outreach apparatus â€œis very much the Obama model â€ “ a data - driven , grassroots - driven campaign â€ “ and it is a reason why our campaign is steadily gathering strengthâ€ � .
Cruz is increasingly seen as a leading Republican contender , uniting factions within the party beyond his evangelical and Tea Party base .
In Iowa â€ “ the first state to vote in the presidential primary , in less than two months â€ “
the outspoken Texas senator dethroned Trump in a poll for the first time this week as the mogul became ensnared in yet more controversy .
Cambridge Analytica has also worked with the Republican candidate Ben Carson , receiving $ 220,000 from his campaign earlier this year .
But the company is more closely involved in Cruzâ€ ™ s presidential bid , with a team of its data scientists currently working at Cruz campaign headquarters in Houston .
Having donated $ 11 m to the main pro - Cruz Super Pac , Keep the Promise I , Mercer is Cruzâ€ ™ s top financier â€ “ and the largest individual donor to Super Pacs or outside groups during the presidential election cycle thus far , according to data compiled by the political transparency website Open Secrets .
Mercerâ€ ™ s connections to both the Cruz campaign and the data firm that is apparently helping to power the senatorâ€ ™ s advantages were previously reported by Politico and Bloomberg .
But political strategists and privacy advocates agreed that Mercerâ€ ™ s parallel funding channels , combined with concerns over the surreptitious , commodified Facebook data â€ “ reported here for the first time â€ “ represented an intensified collision of billionaire financing and digital targeting on the campaign trail .
â€œIf people begin to be turned off by Trump , the Cruz campaign will probably have a better strategic understanding of the implications and how to capitalize upon them , â€ � said Bud Jackson , a Democratic specialist in digital grassroots campaigning , when asked to review the relationships .
â€œWhere a candidateâ€ ™ s campaign may be afraid to go outside the boundaries of ethical behaviour because of a potential public backlash , an outside group may be less afraid.â€
�
In an interview , Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said the campaign had contracted Cambridge Analytica â€œbecause theyâ€ ™ re a market leader and best in the fieldâ€ � but that officials had â€œdone our due diligenceâ€ � .
â€œMy understanding is all the information is acquired legally and ethically with the permission of the users when they sign up to Facebook , â€ � he said , referring questions about previous research to Cambridge Analytica .
The Guardian contacted Cambridge Analytica prior to publication via email with its findings and a list of detailed questions .
Repeated calls were also made to its offices in Washington and New York , as well as its parent company in London .
A representative in New York refused to speak with the Guardian and hung up the phone .
After this article was published , Facebook said the company was â€œcarefully investigating this situationâ€ � regarding the Cruz campaign .
â€œ[M]isleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do , including banning those companies from Facebook and requiring them to destroy all improperly collected data , â€ �
a Facebook spokesman said in a statement to the Guardian .
Christopher Soghoian , principal technologist and senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union , described the Guardianâ€ ™ s findings as â€œtroublingâ€ � and highlighted shortcomings by the FEC to adequately regulate campaignsâ€ ™ use of data .
â€œWhat it essentially means is there is no one regulating campaignsâ€ ™ privacy data and security practices , â€ � he said .
â€œSo it means you have a wild west , where the campaigns can do whatever they want and get away with it.â€ � Research that seeded data on millions Documents seen by the Guardian show Cambridge Analyticaâ€ ™ s parent , a London - based company called Strategic Communications Laboratories ( SCL ) , was first introduced to the concept of using social media data to model human personality traits in early 2014 by Dr Aleksandr Kogan , a lecturer at Cambridge Universityâ€ ™ s renowned psychology department .
Kogan established his own company in spring that year and began working with SCL to deliver a â€œlarge research projectâ€
� in the US .
His stated aim was to get as close to every US Facebook user into the dataset as possible .
The academic used Amazonâ€ ™ s crowdsourcing marketplace Mechanical Turk ( MTurk ) to access a large pool of Facebook profiles , hoovering up tens of thousands of individualsâ€ ™ demographic data â€ “ names , locations , birthdays , genders â€ “ as well as their Facebook â€œlikesâ€ � , which offer a range of personal insights .
This was achieved by recruiting MTurk users by paying them about one dollar to take a personality questionnaire that gave access to their Facebook profiles .
This raised the alarm among some participants , who flagged Kogan for violating MTurkâ€ ™ s terms of service .
â€œThey want you to log into Facebook and then download a bunch of your information , â€ � complained one user at the time .
Crucially , Kogan also captured the same data for each personâ€ ™ s unwitting friends .
For every individual recruited on MTurk , he harvested information about their friends , meaning the dataset ballooned significantly in size .
Research shows that in 2014 , Facebook users had an average of around 340 friends .
Kogan assured the MTurk users their Facebook data would â€œonly be used for research purposesâ€ � and remain â€œanonymous and safeâ€ � .
However , the Facebook data was then used to generate sophisticated models of each of their personalities using the so - called â€œbig fiveâ€ � personality traits and characteristics â€ “ openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , neuroticism ( known as the OCEAN scale ) .
By summer 2014 , Koganâ€ ™ s company had created an expansive and powerful dataset .
His business partner boasted on LinkedIn that their private outfit , Global Science Research ( GSR ) , â€œowns a massive data pool of 40 + million individuals across the United States â€ “ for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profilesâ€ � .
Documents show SCL agreed to a contract with GSR , whereby it would pay its data collection costs in order to improve â€œmatch
ratesâ€
� against SCLâ€ ™ s existing datasets or to enhance GSRâ€ ™ s algorithmâ€ ™ s â€œnational capacity to profile capacity of American citizensâ€
� .
In an email , Kogan said he was unable to explain in detail where all the data came from , as he was restricted by various confidentiality agreements .
He said SCL is no longer a client .
He said that while GSR often used MTurk for data collection , it â€œnever collected more than a couple thousand responses on MTurk for any one project , or even across all projects for a single client â€ “ the vast majority of our MTurk data collection as a company is in the form of surveys onlyâ€ � .
He said GSR stores Facebook data anonymously .
Kogan explained that separate from his university role , his private company undertook various commercial ventures relating to data analysis .
He said that when GSR collect Facebook data , the terms detail the use that information collected will be put to and make clear to participants that they are giving GSR full permission to use the data and user contribution for any purpose .
He said Cambridge University had â€œno knowledge of the clients or projects GSR had worked onâ€
� and that GSR has never used any data collected as part of his university activities .
â€˜Packaging voters like theyâ€ ™ re consumersâ€ ™ Today , Cambridge Analyticaâ€ ™ s central offering to US politicians is to enable them to use the OCEAN scale in shaping highly targeted campaign messages .
This allows candidates like Cruz to campaign on specific issues , but communicate them in multiple ways to different audiences depending on the personal information the company holds about them .
As the companyâ€ ™ s CEO , Alexander Nix , explains in a promotional video : â€œThe more you know about someone , the more you can align a campaign with their requirements or their wants and needs.â€ �
He did not respond to a request for comment .
Michael Zimmer , an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , where he specialises in privacy and internet ethics , described this as a â€œparticularly problematicâ€ � kind of voter targeting that raised broader concerns in the US about â€œpackaging voters like theyâ€ ™ re consumersâ€ � .
â€œItâ€ ™ s
one thing for a marketer to try to predict if people like Coke or Pepsi , â€ � he said ,
â€œbut itâ€
™ s another thing for them to predict things that are much more central to our identity and whatâ€ ™ s more personal in how I interact with the world in terms of social and cultural issues.â€ �
Prior to its relationship with Cruz , Cambridge Analytica worked with a handful of 2014 midterm candidates , according to FEC filings .
The firm also secured hundreds of thousands of dollars of business with John Boltonâ€ ™ s Super Pac , formed by the hawkish former UN ambassador to support conservative candidates campaigning on national security issues .
Ahead of the midterms , Cambridge Analytica reportedly developed a series of TV ads for candidates supported by Bolton , each aimed at different personality types and aired at times when viewers with personalities it aimed to reach were most likely to be watching .
Last week , the Cruz campaign launched a combative TV ad timed to air during a major college football game in Iowa .
In the 30-second ad , Cruz vows : â€œWeâ€ ™ ll rebuild our military , weâ€ ™ ll kill the terrorists and every Islamic militant
will know â€ “ if you wage jihad against us , youâ€ ™ re signing your death warrant.â€
�
Tyler , the Cruz spokesman , said Cambridge Analytica did not work on television advertising for the campaign .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re helping with online targeting and messaging , and thatâ€ ™ s how we find people online ,
â€ � he said .
It remains unclear when Mercerâ€ ™ s involvement with Cambridge Analytica began , but FEC filings show the company started working with Super Pacs that the secretive conservative donor has backed during the second half of 2014 .
On Wednesday in Washington , Cruz was the only member of the Senate armed services committee to skip a hearing on US strategy to combat the Islamic State .
Instead , he travelled to attend a fundraising luncheon in New York hosted by the president of Keep the Promise
I , the Super Pac funded by Mercer that , one day earlier , had announced a $ 600,000 digital advertising strategy to be rolled out via social media in early voting states .
A spokesman for Mercer declined to comment for this article .
Additional reporting by Ben Jacobs in Amana , Iowa"
2015-12-12,"A new poll released on Saturday showed Ted Cruz taking a potentially decisive lead in the Republican field in Iowa .
In a poll released on Saturday by Bloomberg and the Des Moines Register , the Texas senator had the support of 31 % of likely Republican caucus - goers in the first - in - the - nation state , well ahead of Donald Trump at 21 % .
The two were followed by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 13 % and Florida senator Marco Rubio at 10 % .
The only other candidate to poll above the 3 % mark was former Florida governor Jeb Bush .
While the poll was only the second to show Cruz leading in the Hawkeye State , it was conducted by respected pollster Ann Selzer , who is considered the gold standard in measuring the attitudes of the Iowa electorate .
Selzer has consistently outperformed her rivals in predicting the Iowa caucuses .
The poll showed a major collapse since October in support for Carson , who had reached 28 % .
His fortunes have fading as his foreign policy acumen has been called into question , in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California .
In contrast , Cruzâ€ ™ s support has nearly trebled from 10 % in October .
Trump , who leads national polls of likely Republican voters , has shown only a marginal improvement , rising from 19 % to 21 % .
The result reinforces the conventional wisdom that Iowa is a two - man race between Cruz , who has a strong base among evangelicals , and Trump , who has built an organization to turn out the voters who have flocked to his populist campaign .
During a Friday appearance in Des Moines , Trump took aim at Cruz for the first time , criticising his opposition to ethanol subsidies â€ “ a popular issue in the agricultural state ."
2015-12-13,"Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to run as an independent presidential candidate , as Republican backlash over his proposed ban on Muslim immigration coincided with signs of him slipping in the crucial battle for Iowa .
The once dominant frontrunner is now 10 percentage points behind conservative rival Ted Cruz in the state , according to a Des Moines Register - Bloomberg poll that saw Trump slide to second just 49 days before the Iowa caucus on 1 February .
Trump duly turned his fire on Cruz , calling him â€œa little bit of a maniacâ€ � in an interview with Fox News .
In a series of interviews , Trump sought to defend his controversial proposal to bar entry to the US to all Muslims .
He appeared to try to soften his message and deflect claims of racism by attacking the supreme court justice
Antonin Scaliaâ€ ™ s comments on African American students .
But in perhaps the most significant twist in a crucial weekend for the Trump campaign , the maverick real estate mogul once again raised the prospect that he could run as a third - party candidate if he feels badly treated by the Republican establishment .
This nightmare scenario for the GOP , which could dramatically split the conservative vote , was previously ruled out by Trump , who promised to run as a Republican â€ “ but only so long as he was â€œtreated fairlyâ€ � .
He responded angrily to reports this week that party leaders have been discussing alternative ways of deciding the nomination process if Trump leads a divided field by the time of the national convention in Cleveland next July .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been hearing about these closed - door meetings , and I donâ€ ™ t like that , that wasnâ€ ™ t the deal I made , â€ �
Trump told CNN .
â€œI signed a pledge , but a pledge was a double deal : itâ€ ™ s supposed to be honourable .
If itâ€ ™ s that way , they are going to have problems , but I hope itâ€ ™ s not going to be that way.â€ �
Trump also focused on Cruz .
â€œYou look at the way heâ€ ™ s dealt with the Senate , where he goes in there like a â€ “ you know , frankly like a little bit of a maniac , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re never going to get things done that way.â€ �
Cruz took to Twitter to record his tongue - in - cheek response to the claim .
Trump remains ahead of his Texas rival in national polling â€ “ up by 27 % to 22 % , according to the latest NBC / Wall Street Journal poll this weekend â€ “ but is seeing growing questions about his own judgment , particularly on national security and foreign policy .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re in medieval times .
Having a strong temperament is good ,
â€ �
he told CNN when asked about reported comments by House speaker Paul Ryan claiming his anti - Muslim rhetoric could â€œruin the partyâ€ � .
He also questioned the veracity of polling in the wake of his immigration proposal .
â€œI
didnâ€ ™ t do it for polls , so I donâ€ ™ t care what the polls say â€ ¦
I donâ€
™ t think the polls are accurate , â€ � said Trump , who has spent much of his campaign highlighting positive polling .
But there were also signs that the cross - party furore over the proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the US was beginning to get to the normally unflappable reality TV star .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a temporary solution until we get our hands around the problem , â€ � Trump said .
â€œYou are going to have exceptions .
You are going to have people coming in.â€
�
And after being accused of prejudicial language against Hispanic and Muslim people , Trump sought to shore up his credentials among African American voters by attacking justice
Scaliaâ€ ™ s controversial comments this week about black college students deserving to go to â€œlesser schoolsâ€ � .
â€œI thought his remarks were very , very tough â€ ¦ to the African American community , â€ � he said .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t like what he said .
I was very surprised at Scaliaâ€ ™ s comments.â€ �"
2015-12-15,"Donald Trump has once again commanded centre stage â€ “ or at least the attention of the media , if not the world â€ “ with a controversial plan to ban Muslim immigration into the United States , with the release of his health records and with his knack for television ratings .
But as nine Republican candidates eyeing the White House prepare for the partyâ€ ™ s fifth presidential debate on Tuesday night , conservatives are bracing for another narrative to prevail at the Venetian casino and hotel here : the emergence of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio as the most viable alternatives to the mogul who refuses to go away .
Both Cruz and Rubio have steadily risen in the polls behind Trump , prompting many political observers to forecast a scenario in which Republican primary voters will ultimately break away for the first - term senators instead .
Although Trump has shown no signs of fading , questions loom over whether his base of supporters will actually turn out to choose the bombastic businessman as the partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
Cruz and Rubio have until now steered clear of sparring with each other directly on the debate stage , but that dynamic has noticeably shifted since the last time they met five weeks ago .
The two senators , who at 44 are the youngest candidates in the race , have escalated their attacks on each otherâ€ ™ s record while seeking to consolidate support among grassroots conservatives ahead of the Iowa caucuses in early February .
And as issues such as national security and immigration have taken prominence amid terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California , Cruz and Rubio have increasingly sought to exploit what they view as the otherâ€ ™ s weakness .
The contrast is expected to take a sharper turn at the debate , which CNN has already pledged to focus on national security â€ “ even if , as moderator Wolf Blitzer admitted , Trump is â€œprobably rightâ€
� that many viewers come to watch the frontrunner .
With growing concerns among Americans over their safety at home , Rubio has renewed the debate over intelligence gathering and hit Cruz repeatedly over his vote earlier this year to reduce the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s surveillance authorities .
The Florida senator has also looked to portray Cruz as weak on defense more broadly , questioning his tough talk against the Islamic State ( Isis ) and vote against boosting defense spending .
Cruz has taken hold of another angle of the national security debate to make his case against Rubio , seizing on anxiety toward migrants among a faction of conservatives to paint Rubio as weak on border security .
The Texas senator has drawn attention to Rubioâ€ ™ s role in crafting a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 â€ “ an anathema to many conservatives over its inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US .
There are caveats to both arguments : many Republicans , including some who have endorsed Rubio , also voted with Cruz to end the NSAâ€ ™ s bulk collection of phone records , and while Cruz has fashioned himself as an immigration hardliner , he has refused to outline a plan for undocumented immigrants and consistently ducked questions from reporters on whether he supports at least a path to legal status .
But those are mere details as Rubio and Cruz seek to blunt each otherâ€ ™ s momentum , no less at the casino and resort owned by Republican mega - donor Sheldon Adelson .
The billionaire , who in the 2012 election spent roughly $ 100 m in support of Republicans , is notoriously fixated on national security .
Some reports have suggested Adelson is close to endorsing Rubio , while others have noted his wife Miriam favors Cruz .
Cruz took a 10-point lead in the influential Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll of likely Iowa caucus - goers over the weekend , furthering his position as the latest candidate on the rise .
His sudden surge could also open up Cruz to attacks from other contenders , including Trump , who at a pre - debate rally Monday evening dismissed Cruzâ€ ™ s ascent as a fabrication of the media .
Cruz could receive an assist from Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who has also taken to criticizing Rubio over immigration and , like Cruz , is a staunch defender of reforming the NSA .
On foreign policy too , Paul favors a less interventionist approach and has used similar jabs as Cruz in tying Rubio to so - called â€œmilitary adventurismâ€ � favored by neoconservatives .
In an ad leading up to the debate , Paul attacked both Rubio and Cruz over their prior support for taking in more Syrian refugees â€ “ a position the two senators no longer hold .
But Paul has focused the bulk of his ire on Rubio , seeking to dredge up the immigration issue in a host of interviews with conservative media outlets .
The final debate of the year will also be significant for a host of other candidates who are either on the cusp of rising to the next level â€ “ or one step removed from descending into irrelevance .
New Jersey governor Chris Christie has benefited from the national security focus in New Hampshire , the site of the second nominating contest with a hawkish Republican electorate .
Christie , who last month was relegated to the undercard debate , will be back on the main stage Tuesday evening and looking to pick up steam with no clear establishment choice .
( Mike Huckabee , Rick Santorum , George Pataki and Lindsey Graham will spar in the early edition this time around . )
The establishment mantle was once thought to be held by Jeb Bush , whose dramatic fall from presumed frontrunner has made for one of the more unexpected storylines of the political year .
While debates have not been Bushâ€ ™ s forte , a good enough performance will enable the former Florida governor to fend off calls to drop out the race .
Other candidates for whom the debate could be a make - or - break evening include Paul , who barely made the polling cut for the primetime stage , and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina , who some political operatives now view as little more than a passing fad .
Trumpâ€ ™ s shadow is nonetheless expected to loom once again , as the fallout continues from his suggestion that all Muslims be barred from entering the country .
Candidates have until now been reluctant to rally against him , but with the debate marking the final high - profile event of 2015 , it could be the last opportunity with millions watching for Republicans to recapture the party from the corrosive effects of Trump â€ “ if it isnâ€ ™ t already too late ."
2015-12-16,"The US governmentâ€ ™ s right to monitor citizensâ€ ™ phones and data in an effort to catch potential terrorists took centre stage early in Tuesday nightâ€ ™ s Republican debate in Las Vegas .
Candidates clashed over the balance between surveillance and privacy as they sought to prove their security credentials as potential commander - in - chief .
Texas senator Ted Cruz defended his Senate vote earlier this year in favour of the USA Freedom Act , which restricted bulk data collection from millions of people and was hailed as a â€œmilestoneâ€ � by privacy activists .
It improved the previous legislation , he claimed , because it allowed the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to monitor mobile and internet phones as well as landlines .
â€œThe old programme covered 20 to 30 % of phone numbers to search for terrorists , â€ � he said .
â€œThe new programme covers nearly 100 % .
That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism.â€ �
But Marco Rubio , the Florida senator , went on the offensive , saying the authorities had lost an important tool for keeping America safe .
â€œLet me just be very clear : there is nothing that we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before , â€ �
he said .
He also warned that the bill took away agenciesâ€ ™ ability to quickly access phone records , adding : â€œI promise you the next time there is an attack on this country , the first thing people are going to want to know is why didnâ€ ™ t we know about it and why didnâ€ ™ t
we stop it , and the answer had better not be because we didnâ€ ™ t have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attacked.â€ �
Rubio himself then came under attack from Rand Paul .
â€œI think Marco gets it completely wrong , â€ �
he said .
â€œWe are not any safer for the bulk collection of all Americansâ€ ™ records ; in fact I think we are less safe.â€
�
â€ �
In 2013 , whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed in the Guardian the US governmentâ€ ™ s ability to see phone records , follow people from location to location through their phones and track their emails and website visits .
The USA Freedom Act was hailed as an important victory for individual privacy but the rise of Islamic State , and recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , have led to calls from the CIA and others for greater surveillance .
Pressure is also growing on tech companies in Silicon Valley to allow access to encrypted data .
In the wake of terrorist attacks in San Bernardino , Rubio has pushed for restoring the NSAâ€ ™ s phone and data collection programs â€ “ and attacked Cruz for voting in favor of the USA Freedom Act earlier this year .
Asked if he regretted his vote to end the NSAâ€ ™ s bulk collection , Cruz said the reform bill had been mischaracterized .
â€œWhat the Obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens , they focus on law - abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys , â€ � Cruz said .
Rubio bluntly said Cruz was wrong and said more tools were needed for intelligence gathering .
Law enforcement authorities â€œneed the tools and the tools involve encryption , where we can not hear what theyâ€ ™ re even planning , and when we see red flags â€ “ a father , a mother , a neighbour who says weâ€ ™ ve got a problem here
â€ “ then we have to give law enforcement the ability to listen so they can disrupt these terrorist attacks before they
occurâ€ � said Ohio governor John Kasich .
â€œWe can do this but we got ta get moving .
Pay me now , or pay me a lot more later .
This is the direction we need to go.â€ �
Kasich added : â€œWe have to give the local authorities the ability to penetrate and disrupt .
Encryption is a major problem and Congress has got to deal with this , and so does the president , to keep us safe.â€ �
Asked if Silicon Valley firms should be forced to surrender encrypted data , Carly Fiorina , former chief executive of Hewlett - Packard , said : â€œThey do not need to be forced .
They need to be asked to bring the best and brightest , the most recent technology to the table .
I was asked as a CEO .
I complied happily and they will as well .
But they have not been asked.â€ �
Fiorina told an anecdote about how she had worked with the NSA shortly after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks .
â€œSoon after 9/11
I got a phone call from the NSA .
They needed help ; I gave them help .
I stopped a truck load of equipment .
I had it turned around .
It was escorted by the NSA into headquarters .
We need the private sectorâ€ ™ s help because government is not innovating .
Technology is running ahead in leaps and bounds .
The private sector will help , just as I helped after 9/11 , but they must be engaged and they must be asked .
I will ask them ; I know them.â€ � Yahoo !
News reported earlier this year that , after 9/11 , Fiorina received an urgent phone call from the then NSA director Michael Hayden asking her to quickly provide his agency with HP computer servers for expanded surveillance .
The leader in the polls , Donald Trump , had little to say on the subject of the NSA but , asked if he wanted to close parts of the internet to combat Isis , he replied : â€œI would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody .
I sure as hell
donâ€ ™ t want to let people that want to kill us and kill our nation use our internet.â€ � Chris Christie , meanwhile , was unimpressed by Cruz and Rubioâ€ ™ s wrangling over the intricacies of legislation .
â€œIf your eyes are glazed over like mine , this is what itâ€ ™ s like to be on the floor of the United States Senate , â€ � he said .
â€œEndless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people who never had to make a consequential decision from an executive position.â€ �"
2015-12-16,"Carpet - bombed cities , world war three and internet blockades were among the images conjured up by Republican candidates for president on Tuesday night , as the hopefuls took bellicose rhetoric to new heights over the inconveniences of law and fact .
Senator Ted Cruz struck arguably the most overtly belligerent tone of all the candidates , backtracking only slightly from his promise to â€œcarpet bombâ€
�
Islamic State militants wherever they are .
On Tuesday , he said he would â€œcarpet bomb where Isis is , not a city , but the location of troopsâ€ � with â€œdirectedâ€ � air power .
â€œThe object isnâ€ ™ t to level a city .
The object is to kill the Isis terrorists , â€ � he said , only a slight departure from his campaign promise to bomb them â€œinto oblivionâ€ � .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know if sand can glow in the dark , â€ � he told a rally in early December ,
â€œbut weâ€ ™ re going to find out!â€ �
Because Isis largely embeds in cities with the civilian population that it claims to rule , Cruzâ€ ™ s plan would by definition entail wholesale bombing of places where hundreds of thousands of people â€ “ many the victims of Isis crimes themselves â€ “ live .
During the debate , Cruz compared his notion of carpet bombing to the US strategy in the first Iraq war , when the US launched about 1,000 airstrikes a day .
Pentagon leaders past and present have noted that those air strikes , which relied on precision missile technology and targeted a traditional military , were not a carpet - bomb campaign like the one the US unsuccessfully carried out in Vietnam in 1972 .
Testifying before the Senate last week , Gen Paul Selva , vice - chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said Cruzâ€ ™ s proposal â€œis not the way that we apply force in combat .
It isnâ€ ™ t now nor will it ever
be.â€ � The first Iraq war also left dictator Saddam Hussein in power , despite his defeat , an end that no presidential candidate has suggested would be acceptable for the leaders of Isis .
Cruz did say , however , that he prefers dictators , such as Egyptâ€ ™ s deposed Hosni Mubarak and Libyaâ€ ™ s
now - deceased Muammar Gaddafi , to the unpredictable revolutionaries who followed them .
He claimed that Gaddafi assisted the US in fighting terrorism , even though he was designated the leader of a state sponsor of terrorism for decades .
Chris Christie similarly said he sided with autocrats , name - dropping his â€œfriendâ€ � King Hussein of Jordan
â€ “ a monarch dead 16 years and the father of current King Abdullah .
Cruzâ€ ™ s repeated promises to â€œhunt
downâ€ � and â€œutterly destroyâ€ �
terrorists made him the most explicitly aggressive candidate on Tuesday night , but even he did not express nonchalance about killing civilians , as Donald Trump and Ben Carson did .
Earlier this month , Trump said the US should â€œtake outâ€
� the families of militants to deter terrorism .
On Tuesday he repeated his rationale for killing civilians : â€œI would be very , very firm with families .
Frankly , that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives , but they do care , believe it or not , about their familiesâ€ ™ lives.â€ �
Carson , a retired neurosurgeon , compared the strategy of indiscriminate force to the process of opening up a childâ€ ™ s head to remove a tumor .
â€œYou have to be able to look at the big picture and understand that itâ€ ™ s actually merciful if you go ahead and finish the job , â€ � he said , â€œrather than death by 1,000 pricks.â€ �
Asked by the moderator whether he was â€œOK with the deaths of thousands of innocent children and
civiliansâ€ � , Carson replied : â€œYou got it .
You got it.â€
�
The Geneva Conventions prohibit â€œindiscriminate
attacksâ€ � , including aerial bombardment ; the US and most of the worldâ€ ™ s nations are signatories to the conventions , although the US has not signed on to all provisions and has tried to interpret the rules to its advantage .
In October , a US warplane bombed a civilian hospital in Afghanistan , raising prospects of a war crime inquiry over the apparent accident .
A bombing campaign as prescribed by Cruz , Carson or Trump would at best have questionable legality , make the US an international pariah and exacerbate the refugee crisis .
â€œIf you are going to kill the families of terrorists , realize that thereâ€ ™ s something called the Geneva Convention weâ€ ™ re going to have to pull out of , â€ � Senator Rand Paul pointed out to his rivals .
â€œIt would defy every norm that is America.â€ �
Candidates were not only insouciant about human rights abroad ; they also felt comfortable doubting rights enshrined by US law .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re an American citizen and you decide to join up with Isis , weâ€ ™ re not going to read you your Miranda rights ,
â€ �
Senator Marco Rubio said , referring to the fifth amendment right to silence and the sixth amendment right to legal representation .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re going to be treated as an enemy combatant , â€ � Rubio said , â€œa member of an army attacking this country.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s threat recalls the controversial drone strike that killed American Anwar al - Awlaki , an al - Qaida leader , in Yemen in 2011 .
The ACLU sued the US government over that strike , and any policy that would strip Americans of rights in the US would almost certainly face challenges , if not outright rejection , from the courts .
Rubio , Chris Christie and others also support expanded surveillance powers for the NSA and FBI â€ “ a proposal that has already , at least in part , been ruled illegal in court .
Bulk collection of phone and internet records raises a slew of constitutional questions , all of which are pet peeves for the libertarian - leaning Paul .
Trump went further , suggesting the US should â€œpenetrate the internetâ€ � and block sections of it to stop Isis recruitment .
â€œI would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody , â€ �
he said .
â€œI sure as hell donâ€
™ t want to let people that want to kill us and kill our nation use our internet.â€ � Paul quickly raised first amendment speech rights , arguing that Trumpâ€ ™ s idea amounts to censorship .
â€œAre you going to change the constitution?â€ � he asked .
Trump also said Isis was â€œusing the internet better than we are ... and it was our ideaâ€ � .
It was in fact Sir Tim Berners - Lee , a Briton , who invented the world wide web .
Paul also repeatedly accused his rivals of pushing the US toward a third world war , and relative moderates , like Jeb Bush and John Kasich , called their opponents cartoonish and unrealistic â€ “ to no avail .
The tone that won the debate was aggressive from start to finish , and candidates ended by taking aim at political correctness itself .
Christie called the president a â€œfeckless weaklingâ€ � , Bush named Trump a â€œchaos candidateâ€ � , Carson demanded we â€œget rid of all this PC stuffâ€ � , and Cruz claimed â€œpolitical correctness is killing peopleâ€ � .
â€œThe Obama administration , like a lot of folks here , â€ � he said , â€œwant to search everyoneâ€ ™ s cellphones and e - mails and not focus on the bad guys.â€
�
Cruz did not elaborate on how authorities would have noticed the pseudonymous Facebook post of a San Bernardino attacker , or the â€œpublic call to jihadâ€ � of one of the Boston Marathon bombers , if only they had not worried about offending someone .
Instead the senator changed the subject , to a simpler question of language .
â€œOne of the things weâ€ ™
ve seen here is how easy it is for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to get distracted from dealing with radical Islamic terrorism , â€ � he said .
â€œThey wonâ€ ™ t even call it by its name.â€ �"

Hereâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s crackling in politics : Rubio and Cruz beef continues to build The rival Republican camps of Florida senator Marco Rubio and Texas senator Ted Cruz threw jabs Wednesday after the candidates clashed at Tuesdayâ€

The conservative blogosphere burbled with signs of resentment that Cruz was attacking Rubio while laying off Trump .
Candidates flee Vegas ... except Carson Speaking of Trump , he popped up in his airplane in Mesa , Arizona , for what looked like a sizable rally .
Cruz flew to Los Angeles while Rubio hit Iowa and then New Hampshire .
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , though , stayed for a rally in Las Vegas , where he predicted he would be a one - term president , at most .
Congress announces deal on taxes and spending Early Wednesday morning , House speaker Paul Ryan announced that leaders of both chambers had reached a bipartisan agreement on a tax ( $ 650bn)-and - spending ( $ 1.1tn ) package that Congress is likely to pass later in the week .

: Rubio - Cruz continues : How embarrassed does Trump look to be holding a copy of Playboy with himself on the cover ?
In which Benjy Sarlin at MSNBC helpfully explains what that Cruz - Rubio immigration fight last night was all about .
â€œLike
a lot of arguments involving two senators , the fight rests on a complicated argument over policy , procedure , and tactics , â€ � Sarlin writes .
The two argued about where they stand now on handling the estimated 11 m undocumented migrants in the United States , where they stand now on the question of admitting more immigrants legally , and where they stood in 2013 , when a group of senators including Rubio led the passage of an immigration reform bill .
Hereâ€ ™ s Sarlin on a shift in Cruzâ€ ™ s position on what to do with undocumented immigrants :
But on illegal immigration , things get more complex .
Cruz has spent months and months and monthsducking questions as to what he would eventually do with undocumented immigrants , usually saying itâ€ ™ s a â€œconversationâ€ � for another time once the border is secure .
Read this exchange with Chuck Todd onMeet The Press from July .
Itâ€ ™ s almost painful how much Cruz does not want to address this topic .
That changed on Tuesday , though , when Rubio challenged Cruz to say whether he favors legal status or not .
For the first time , Cruz appeared to shift decisively against it .
â€œI have never supported legalization , and I do not intend to support legalization , â€ � Cruz said .
Rubioâ€ ™ s camp pointed to the phrase â€œintendâ€ � as an obvious weasel word ...

As the debate unfolded in Las Vegas , House speaker Paul Ryan went to work to sell a bipartisan tax - and - spending deal to his caucus , ultimately issuing a statement of a sealed deal after midnight .
The House plans to pass the package as two separate bills , to be rolled together for the Senate to pass , likely later this week .
Congress was expected pass yet another piece of legislation to avert the risk of a government shutdown before the new package is in place .
Ryan said the spending bill puts a two - year moratorium on a tax on medical devices and postpones the â€œCadillac
taxâ€ � on costly health care plans .
Additionally , the agreement extends valuable tax reflief to lumber companies , racetrack owners , apple growers , cider makers and others , according to the New York Times .
The tax breaks are worth about $ 650bn and the spending bill weighs in at $ 1.1tn , according to the Washington Post .

After the debate , four caucus - goers who represented a fair cross section of establishment Republican sentiment offered mixed reviews of the moderators and the candidates .
Shane Blanchard , a member of the city council in Waukee , said : â€œI think CNN did a good job , â€ � although he expressed some concerns about the lengthy back - and - forth exchanges between candidates like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio .

and it goes for so long
it does a disservice to the debate , â€ � he added .

divisiveness.â€ �

The Bush team cuts a web video around the candidateâ€ ™ s attack lines last night on Trump : Annoyed into responding by Bushâ€ ™ s badgering , Trump last night snapped : â€œIâ€ ™ m at 42 and youâ€ ™ re at three!â€ �
A factcheck shows us that while the recent Monmouth University poll had Trump at 41 % support among Republicans and Republican - leaning voters and Bush at 3 % , the national polling averages have Trump closer to 33 and Bush clear up at 4 .
While former Florida governor Jeb Bush spent Tuesday evening attacking Trump , Chris Christie , the New Jersey governor , noticably laid off the polling frontrunner .
Christie continued to pull his punches this morning .
Not good primary politics to attack the Donald , it appears heâ€ ™ s decided .
Or maybe this is simply the way he feels .
If you missed last nightâ€ ™ s proceedings , you can experience them as if in real time here , on our live blog : The Republican debate on Tuesday in Las Vegas was so long ago that Marco Rubio has already stopped in Iowa en route to New Hampshire , Ted Cruz is already under Senate investigation and a central conjecture of the candidatesâ€ ™ discussion on national security appears to have folded .
Never fear â€ “ weâ€ ™ ll catch you up and run along the campaign trail so you donâ€

Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs was with Rubio in Ankeny , Iowa ... ...
while Sabrina Siddiqui and Paul Lewis in Las Vegas have delivered a comprehensive analysis of last nightâ€ ™ s proceedings , for those still catching up : ( Thereâ€ ™ s this , too , from columnist Jeb Lund on the Strip . )
As for Cruz , Senate intelligence chair Richard Burr says his staff is looking into the possibility that the candidate aired classified info in his discussion onstage last night of how the USA Freedom Act changed the NSAâ€ ™
s ability to search phone numbers .
Burr didnâ€ ™ t watch the debate , though , with more urgent programming to see : UPDATE : Reuters reports that the suspects in the San Bernardino terror attacks did not describe their intentions to commit terrorist acts on social media , as has been widely reported and as discussed extensively last night be the candidates .
The â€œfactâ€ � that the department of homeland security â€œfailedâ€ � to search the suspectsâ€ ™ social media accounts , many Republican candidates said , pointed to alarming flaws in the countryâ€ ™ s procedures for screening immigrants , and to a basic incompetence at the core of the Obama administration .
Except it appears there were no social media posts .
( CNN is reporting elsewhere , however , that the FBI has concluded the suspects exchanged direct messages in 2013 stating their intentions . )

2015-12-16,"Long story short from Las Vegas on Tuesday : It was long on substance .
Candidates were asked about national security issues , immigration policy , government surveillance and naughty things the candidates have said about each other on the campaign trail .
Florida senator Marco Rubio and Texas senator Ted Cruz locked horns ... ...
over Rubioâ€ ™ s support for immigration reform and over Cruzâ€ ™ s support for reining in NSA surveillance .
Both fought expertly .
No clear winner declared .
Donald Trump said he had no plan to run ... ... as a third - party candidate .
( Sorry . )
â€œI am totally committed to the Republican party , â€ �
Trump said as the festivities were concluding .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush repeatedly attacked Trump He called him the â€œchaos candidateâ€ � and said : â€œYouâ€ ™ re not going to insult your way to president of the United States.â€
�
Was it such a combative night ?
Not really â€ “ neither Cruz nor Rubio , nor New Jersey governor Chris Christie , opted to totally tangle with Trump , who himself passed on an invitation to go after Cruz .
( Christie did , however , call President Obama a â€œfeckless weaklingâ€ � . )
Did Trump botch a question ?
There was one about the countryâ€ ™ s triad of nuclear defenses .
He didnâ€
™ t answer a question about which needed updating most urgently .
Rubio left the door open on a path to citizenship on immigration
At least for some undocumented migrants , which is considered heresy in some corners of the Republican party .
â€œI personally am open to people having the possibility of applying for a green card , â€ � he said â€ “ after 10 yearsâ€ ™ probation and strict tests .
Rand Paul , the Kentucky senator , did go after Trump
Because , you know , Trump said he wanted to shred the Constitution .
But Trump pretty much ignored him .
A
( sort of ) substantive big - picture debate broke out !
Over whether itâ€ ™ s better for the US national security to have dictators in the Middle East .
This , however , remains unresolved .
And former Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina quoted Thatcher â€œMargaret Thatcher once said , if you want something talked about , ask a man .
If you want something done , ask a woman.â€ �"
2015-12-16,"The Republican partyâ€ ™ s next - generation candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz went head - to - head on immigration reform , surveillance and US foreign policy in the final presidential debate of the year , battling to claim the mantle as the most viable alternative to the bombastic frontrunner Donald Trump .
The pair of first - term senators , who have been on a collision course for weeks , dominated the stage in Las Vegas , Nevada , with a series of fiery exchanges in a debate devoted almost entirely to national security following terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California .
As Rubio and Cruz sparred over how to respond to the threat posed by the Islamic State , Jeb Bush instead took on the challenge of countering the Trump phenomenon .
The former Florida governor came out swinging early on in the debate , questioning Trumpâ€ ™ s ability to serve as commander - in - chief after his controversial plan to ban all Muslim immigration into the United States .
â€œDonald is great at the one - liners , but heâ€ ™ s a chaos candidate .
And heâ€ ™ d be a chaos president , â€ � Bush said .
â€œHe would not be the commander - in - chief we need to keep our country safe.â€ �
Trump , who tolerated him at first , eventually turned on Bush in a tart and petty exchange which scarcely rose above the level of playground taunts about who was toughest .
The debate at the Venetian hotel was arguably the most charged performance by Bush , whose campaign is in desperate need of a boost after struggling to take off despite his family legacy and mighty war chest .
The evening was nonetheless dominated by the escalating feud between Rubio and Cruz , which has spilled out into the public arena over the last five weeks .
The two senators , both 44 , exposed a deep rift within the Republican party and competing visions of the future : on military intervention amid global chaos ; on the federal governmentâ€ ™ s spying authorities ; and on how the US should reform its broken immigration system .
Perhaps the most consequential exchanges between the two were on the subject of the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States â€
“ a contentious and potentially defining issue of the Republican primary .
Cruz , joined by Kentucky senator Rand Paul , resurrected Rubioâ€ ™ s role as the co - author of a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 that provided a path to citizenship for the undocumented , in an attempt to tie the senator to a so - called â€œamnestyâ€ � policy reviled by grassroots Republicans .
Rubioâ€ ™ s immigration efforts , a continued source of skepticism among conservatives , had not been raised in the four previous debates .
The Cuban - American Florida senator stood by what he deemed his â€œpersonalâ€ � support for eventually allowing law - abiding undocumented immigrants to apply for green cards â€ “ and attempted to turn the tables on Cruz for having a position not too dissimilar to his .
Cruz supported legalization for the undocumented and a massive expansion of visas for high - skilled workers , Rubio argued â€ “ an analogy Cruz likened to comparing â€œthe fireman and the arsonist â€ ¦ because they were both at the scene of the fireâ€ � .
Cruz nonetheless continued to dodge the question of what he would do with the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the country , simply stating , â€œI have never supported legalization
and I do not intend to support legalization.â€
�
An even lengthier back - and - forth occurred over the issue of surveillance , with Rubio making an aggressive push for the restoration of the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s power to collect phone and data records in bulk .
Bush and Trump also lined up with him , while Cruz and Paul resisted .
â€œI promise you the next time there is an attack on this country ,
the first thing people are going to ask is why didnâ€ ™ t we know about it , â€ � Rubio said , while adding that Cruz , Paul and other Republicans had voted to â€œweakenâ€ � the federal governmentâ€ ™ s intelligence - gathering methods .
Rubioâ€ ™ s claim was rebuffed by both Cruz and Paul , who accused the Florida senator of misleading on the effectiveness of the NSA programs .
â€œWhat [ Rubio ] knows is that the old program covered 20 - 30 % of phone numbers to search for terrorists , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThe new program covers nearly 100%.â€ �
Paul added that the country was â€œnot any saferâ€ � after its bulk collection , but in fact less safe due to the distraction of having millions of Americansâ€ ™ records rather than focusing specifically on potential terrorists .
The use of American military might also drew sharp divisions between Rubio , who took on a traditional hawkish tone , and the less interventionist approach favored by Cruz and Paul .
Cruz , who has advocated against US involvement in the Syrian civil war , argued it was not in the countryâ€ ™ s interest to join in the toppling of foreign governments .
â€œWe keep hearing from President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Washington Republicans that theyâ€ ™ re searching for these mythical moderate rebels , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like a purple unicorn .
They never exist .
These moderate rebels end up being jihadists.â€ �
Paul also pushed back against engaging the US military in the fight against Isis , focusing instead on the need to close borders and halt immigration from â€œhigh - risk terrorist countriesâ€ � .
At one point , he rebuked the hawkish New Jersey governor Chris Christie , telling the audience : â€œIf you are in favor of World War III , you have your candidate!â€ �
Not everyone on stage was enthused by the dominance of the three senators .
Christie looked to position himself as a candidate who actually had direct knowledge of combating terrorism , drawing on his experience after the terrorist attacks on September 11 2001 .
In his trademark blunt style , Christie looked into the camera to speak with the audience watching on television .
â€œIf your eyes are glazing over like mine , this is what itâ€ ™ s like to be on the floor of the United States Senate , â€ � Christie said .
â€œI mean , endless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people
whoâ€ ™ ve never had to make a consequential decision in an executive position .
â€œThe fact is , for seven years , I had to make these decisions after 9/11 , make a decision about how to proceed forward with an investigation or how to pull back , whether you use certain actionable intelligence or whether not to .
And yet they continue to debate about this bill and in the subcommittee and what â€ “ nobody in America cares about that.â€ �"
2015-12-16,"The deep fissures in the Republican race for the White House have been laid bare during a televised debate marked by profound ideological clashes between candidates desperate to be noticed amid the suffocating dominance of the Republican frontrunner , Donald Trump .
On a night that may be remembered for Trumpâ€ ™ s defence of a policy of deliberately killing innocent civilians if they are the family members of Islamist fighters , his rivals for the Republican nomination appeared divided on issues as fundamental as immigration , surveillance , freedom of speech and regime change abroad .
It was a debate of repeated , one - on - one duels on the debate stage in Las Vegas , the most consequential of which occurred between Texas senator Ted Cruz and Florida senator Marco Rubio .
The two candidates , who are best poised to challenge Trump in a nomination process that begins with the Iowa caucus in just seven weeks , repeatedly locked horns over the ideological battles that have been engulfing their party for years .
It was the final Republican presidential debate of the year â€ “ and the first since the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California , which prompted Trumpâ€ ™ s incendiary proposal to ban foreign Muslims from entering the country .
None of the other eight candidates on stage supported Trumpâ€ ™ s plan for religious discrimination at the border .
But amid polls showing as many as 59 % of Republicans supporting a halt on Muslims entering the country few candidates showed much appetite for taking on the former host of The Apprentice .
â€œI understand why they feel that way , â€ �
Rubio said of Republicans supportive for Trumpâ€ ™ s ban on Muslims .
Cruz chose similar language , saying â€œeveryone understands why Donald has suggested what he hasâ€ � .
Amid a general show of timidity toward the frontrunner , one of the exceptions was former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who stepped up to the plate to swing at Trump with uncharacteristic zeal .
Bush said the ban on Muslims was â€œnot a serious proposalâ€ � and would alienate the very allies in the Middle East required to defeat Islamist fighters .
â€œDonald , you know , is great at the one - liners , â€ � Bush added .
â€œBut heâ€ ™ s a chaos candidate , and heâ€ ™ d be a chaos president.â€ �
It was the first of several tense bouts between Trump and Bush , who twice told the billionaire : â€œYouâ€ ™ re not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.â€
�
Another altercation occurred when Trump defended his position of intentionally killing innocent civilians who are family members of Islamic State militants â€ “ a breach of international law .
Trump invoked the September 11 terrorist attacks to justify killing family members of militants , saying it would deter future attacks .
â€œThey may not care much about their lives , but they do care , believe it or not , about their families , â€ � he explained .
Bush hit back , insisting the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s proposal was â€œjust crazyâ€ � .
Trump , who tolerated him at first , eventually turned on Bush in a tart and petty exchange that scarcely rose above the level of playground taunts about whose turn it was to talk .
The fracas ended with Trump mocking Jebâ€ ™ s standing in the polls .
â€œIâ€ ™ m at 42 and youâ€ ™ re at three , â€ �
Trump said , referring at a poll this week that showed he has increased his already commanding lead .
â€œSo
Iâ€ ™ m doing better.â€ � â€˜World War IIIâ€ ™ The tussles between Trump , who has exceeded all expectations in this race , and Bush , who even allies concede has been underwhelming , set the tone for a debate that drew out the points of differences between the White House aspirants .
The most noteworthy divisions were between Cruz and Rubio , who are second and third respectively in most of the polls .
Early on , the pair became embroiled in a detailed debate over the merits of the USA Freedom Act , the legislation that halted the bulk collection of Americanâ€ ™ s phone records disclosed by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden .
Rubio criticised Cruz for having supported the legislation .
â€œI promise you the next time there is an attack on this country , the first thing people are going to want to know is why didnâ€ ™ t we know about it and why didnâ€ ™ t
we stop it
, â€ � the Florida senator said .
â€œAnd the answer had better not be because we didnâ€ ™ t have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attacked.â€ �
Other candidates quickly became involved in the debate over privacy and national security â€ “ one that will keep fact - checkers busy for days to come .
Ohio senator John Kasich called for legislation to â€œsolve the problem of encryptionâ€ � , after claiming secure communications impeded the FBI from viewing communications between the San Bernardino shooters and other individuals they were monitoring .
( No such evidence has been made public by the FBI . )
Meanwhile , Carly Fiorina touted her cooperation with the NSA when she was chief executive of Hewlett Packard , and claimed that other Silicon Valley tech firms â€œdo not need to be forcedâ€ � to cooperate with law enforcement because they will happily comply if asked .
( Companies such as Apple , Facebook and Twitter , which are all resisting what they regard as undue government interference , may beg to differ . )
Trump , on the other hand , did not show much interest in the finer points of privacy , encryption and internet freedom , instead advancing a vague notion that parts of the internet could somehow be â€œclosedâ€ � .
He declined to be drawn on specifics on what that would mean , saying only that he would want â€œbrilliant people from Silicon Valley and other placesâ€ � to figure out a way to impede Islamic Stateâ€ ™ s use of the internet â€œYou talk freedom of speech .
You talk freedom of anything you want , â€ � he said .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want them using our internet to take our young , impressionable youth.â€ �
Libertarian senator Rand Paul was left aghast at what he portrayed as multiple assaults on constitutional rights from his fellow Republicans .
The Kentucky senator took rivals to task over the the wisdom of seeking to depose dictators such as the Syrian leader , Bashar al - Assad , and the logic of shooting down Russian fighter jets found to be intruding over any future no - fly zone over Syria .
It was the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , who is predicating his bona fides as a tough , no - nonsense commander - in - chief , who said that he would not flinch when faced with errant Russian fighter jet in the region .
â€œYes , we would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now , â€ � Christie said .
Paul responded that any such move would be â€œrecklessâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s a recipe for World War III , â€ � the senator said .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re in favour of World War III , you have your candidate.â€ � â€˜Fireman and arsonistâ€ ™
The end of the debate , hosted at the Venetian , an Italian - themed casino resort owned by Republican mega - donor Sheldon Adelson , and billed as a wide - ranging discussion of national security in its broadest terms , focused mostly on issues of defence .
The CNN moderators did not ask a single question about the historic global accord reached in Paris on Saturday to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change â€ “ which Barack Obama and many other leaders around the world regard an issue of national security .
Neither did they ask about gun control , despite the recent spate of mass shootings .
Immigration , however , was discussed extensively , and was the source of the most significant standoff between Cruz and Rubio .
The two senators , both staunch conservatives elected on the back of Tea Party support , are vying for the position as Trumpâ€ ™ s chief challenger .
Both are sons of Cuban immigrants but are on opposing ends of the Republican spectrum on the vexed issue of immigration reform .
Rubioâ€ ™ s achilles heel in the race is his failed attempt to pass comprehensive reform through the Senate two years ago , and his continued â€ “ albeit heavily caveated â€ “ support for a path that would enable some undocumented migrants to one day become US citizens .
It has put him at odds with the majority of his party â€ “ and at loggerheads with Cruz who , like Trump , is making an unforgiving stance on immigration a cornerstone of his campaign .
When Rubio tried to downplay the differences between the two candidates , Cruz responded with a sharp retort .
â€œFor Marco to suggest our recordâ€ ™ s the same is like likening the fireman and the arsonist because they are both at the scene of the fire , â€ � he said .
Cruz added the battle against the Islamic state â€œisnâ€ ™ t just in Iraq and Syria , itâ€ ™ s in Kennedy airport and the Rio Grandeâ€ � and accused Rubio of being on the side of the â€œmassive amnesty planâ€ � pushed by Obama and other Democrats .
Yet for all his debating skills , Cruz also found himself cornered by Rubio .
After weeks of ducking questions from reporters over whether he would countenance granting undocumented immigrants any form of legal status , Cruz was finally pressed to take a position when his rival asked him whether he would rule it out .
â€œI have never supported legalisation , and I do not intend to support legalisation , â€ � he said .
The argument was concluded when the moderator intervened and asked Trump which of the candidates â€ “ Cruz or Rubio â€ “
he sided with .
The frontrunner looked momentarily flummoxed .
â€œI have a very hardline position , â€ � he answered , declining to take sides .
It was an apt response after a night when , despite all of the fighting talk from Republican hopefuls , there was no clear victor .
Neither was there an obvious loser , although the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , who has watched his support base collapse in recent weeks , struggled to make an impression .
Carson opened the night with a moment of silence for victims of the San Bernardino that lasted all of five seconds , responded to his very first question by complaining he wasnâ€ ™ t being given enough airtime â€ “ and then declined a request to contribute to the debate over surveillance .
â€œI think you have to ask them about that , â€ �
Carson answered when CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer invited him to intervene in a discussion over reform of the NSA .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to get in between them .
Let them fight.â€ �"
2015-12-17,"Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform were always thought to be a vulnerability in the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s
pursuit of the Republican nomination for president .
But few expected it would be Ted Cruz , the Texas senator who has fashioned himself as an immigration hardliner , who would find himself on the defensive .
The hints of a brewing storm over immigration â€ “ a contentious issue among Republicans , exacerbated this cycle by frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial tone toward immigrants â€ “ have been evident for some time .
But a sharp exchange in this weekâ€ ™ s presidential debate between Rubio and Cruz , both Cuban American senators , exposed the fissures that could define the remainder of the Republican primary .
It is Cruz , a longtime critic of so - called â€œamnestyâ€ � policies , who has spent the greater part of the debateâ€ ™ s aftermath seeking to clarify his position .
That Americaâ€ ™ s complex immigration system needs reform is an area of widespread consensus .
But the crux of the rift among Republicans is what to do about the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US .
Itâ€ ™ s a question Cruz had ducked for weeks , despite repeated efforts by reporters to pin down the senatorâ€ ™ s position on the campaign trail .
Standing on the debate stage before millions of Americans watching at home , Cruz finally addressed the issue by coming out against legal status for undocumented immigrants .
â€œI have never supported legalization and I do not intend to support legalization , â€ � Cruz said , after Rubio pressed the Texan in a tense back - and - forth between the two senators .
It was a tepid declaration , leaving many observers â€ “ including Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign â€ “ zeroing in on Cruzâ€ ™ s use of â€œintendâ€ � to remain deliberately vague .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign chairman later told reporters the senator was â€œunequivocallyâ€ � against legalization for anyone residing in the country illegally .
Cruzâ€ ™ s bullishness against legalization , however , marked a shift from two years earlier when the US Senate debated a comprehensive immigration bill co - authored by Rubio .
The 2013 legislation , at the time a landmark compromise by a bipartisan group of senators known as the â€œGang of Eightâ€ � , included a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented .
At the time the bill was debated , Cruz repeatedly advocated for an amendment that would strip citizenship from the compromise and instead stop at simply legalization for the undocumented .
On Wednesday , Cruz stumbled through an interview on Fox News when asked to reconcile his prior statements in support of legalization with the position he took in the debate less than 24 hours earlier .
â€œThe fact that I introduced an amendment to remove part of the Gang of Eight bill doesnâ€
™ t mean I support the rest of the Gang of Eight bill , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThe Gang of Eight bill was a mess , it was a terrible bill.â€
�
Fox News host Bret Baier , armed with quotes Cruz gave during the Senate immigration debate , painted a different picture â€ “ in which the senator repeatedly pushed for legalization .
Among them was an appearance by Cruz at his alma mater Princeton University , in which he cast his pro - legalization approach as a meaningful compromise .
â€œI believe that if my amendments were adopted , the bill would pass , â€ �
Cruz said in his remarks in May 2013 .
â€œMy effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and fixed the problem.â€ �
Asked to respond in his interview with Fox , Cruz appeared somewhat flummoxed .
â€œOf
course I wanted the bill â€ “ my amendment , to pass , â€ �
he said .
â€œWhat my amendment did was take citizenship off the table.â€
�
Cruz went on to claim that his measure was a poison pill , designed to kill the broader immigration bill and expose â€œthe hypocrisyâ€ � of those pushing for its passage .
He also tied Rubio to Democrats for his role in shepherding the immigration bill through the Senate .
In his own interview with Fox on Wednesday , Rubio said Cruz was â€œclearly a supporter of legalizationâ€ � and was only now singing a different tune as he courts conservatives , skeptical of immigration reform .
â€œBasically the argument he was making is , we can pass immigration reform
but we canâ€
™ t do citizenship .
Letâ€ ™ s just do legalization and if we do that , this bill has a chance of passing ,
â€ �
Rubio said of Cruz .
â€œNow , of course , in this campaign heâ€ ™ s looking for political advantage and so he tries to obscure the lines on it.â€ �
Rubio framed his own involvement in the comprehensive immigration reform effort , which subsequently soured his appeal among grassroots conservatives , as wanting to make a difference under a Senate led by Democrats .
He has since disavowed that approach and , for nearly two years , has advocated for a piecemeal approach to immigration reform that begins with enforcement at the border .
â€œAt this point
itâ€ ™ s the prudent thing to do , â€ �
Rubio said on Fox .
â€œWe just canâ€ ™ t pass this comprehensively.â€
�
Of his showdown with Cruz , Rubio added : â€œThe point I was trying to make is , I donâ€
™ t know how he can attack me on this issue when he himself supports legalization.â€
�
The rivalry between Rubio and Cruz is expected to dominate the coming weeks , as both senators jockey to dethrone Trump of his frontrunner status when the nominating contests begin .
Both senators have steadily risen in the polls and are well positioned in two of the early states â€ “ in Iowa , Cruz surged and in one influential poll last week took a 10-point lead over Trump ; and in New Hampshire , Rubio has ranked second behind Trump in a series of polls .
There are several other areas of disagreement between the two â€ “ including on surveillance and engaging the US military overseas â€ “ but the implications of the immigration debate are arguably the most profound .
Rubioâ€ ™ s own pollster predicted that Republicans would need to secure roughly 40 % of the Latino vote to win back the White House .
In 2012 , Mitt Romney pulled in just 27 % .
Alfonso Aguilar , the executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles , said Rubio was following a smarter strategy in positioning himself for a general election .
â€œRubio has said that the Senate bill he supported wasnâ€ ™ t a perfect bill , but he thought we needed to get the ball rolling .
Now heâ€
™ s saying , look Iâ€ ™ m still committed , we just have to change tactics to get things done , â€ �
Aguilar said .
â€œCruz , on the other hand , now has a credibility problem by going after Rubio , because in the debate he moved to the extreme .
It looks like clear pandering.â€ �
While building his candidacy as an inevitable landing place for Trump supporters should the real estate mogul fall from his mantle , Cruz has flipped on other aspects of the immigration debate .
He has called for the suspension of H-1B visas for highly skilled workers , after having previously supported a five - fold expansion of the same program .
Cruz has also embraced an end to birthright citizenship , even though he once stated it was â€œa
mistakeâ€ � for conservatives to fight the protection of birthright citizenship under the US constitution .
Rubioâ€ ™ s transformation has centered more on process as opposed to principles .
The senator has maintained he is â€œpersonally openâ€ � to some of the law - abiding undocumented immigrants eventually applying for green cards , although he has yet to specify how a pathway to citizenship would be achieved under his step - by - step proposal .
Rubioâ€ ™ s Democratic opponents have argued there would be no citizenship under his administration and , along with progressive immigration advocates , labeled the Floridian no less tough on the issue than Trump and Cruz .
In a speech before the National Immigrant Integration Conference this week , Hillary Clinton previewed a line of attack against Rubio in a potential general election match - up .
â€œNow you know , Senator Rubio actually helped write the 2013 immigration bill .
Now he renounces it ,
â€ � she said .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re all moving toward the extreme.â€ �
Rubio defended his attitude toward immigration in Tuesday nightâ€ ™ s debate , speaking of the issue as one he is intrinsically tied to through his family and West Miami hometown , with its sprawling Latino community .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an issue Iâ€ ™ ve lived around my whole life , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œMy family are immigrants .
My wifeâ€ ™ s family are immigrants .
All of my neighbors are immigrants.â€ � â€œI see every aspect of this problem .
The good , the bad , and the ugly.â€ � While the consequences of adopting too hard of a line could linger should Rubio be the nominee , at least for now , the senatorâ€ ™ s main challenge is blunting Cruzâ€ ™ s momentum .
And on immigration , itâ€ ™ s a battle in which he has unexpectedly turned the tables on Cruz in this initial round .
In recent days , Cruz has gone so far as to suggest he would deport undocumented immigrants
â€ “ another question on which he had previously hedged .
â€œI would enforce the law , â€ �
Cruz told CNN after the debate .
â€œFederal immigration law provides that if someone is here illegally and is apprehended , that they should be sent back to their home country.â€ �
Arizona senator John McCain , who co - authored the Senate immigration bill with Rubio , said his impression was that Cruzâ€ ™
s posturing did indeed amount to a flip - flop .
â€œSenator Cruz has done a remarkable 180 , but you can do that nowadays when youâ€ ™ re running for president , â€ �
McCain said when asked by the Guardian if he believed Cruz genuinely supported legalization .
â€œHe used to , â€ � McCain said , before adding in a mocking tone : â€œHe wanted to expand the H1-B visas â€
“
that was an amendment he had on that
â€˜terribleâ€ ™ Gang of Eight proposal ... that evil plot to destroy America.â€ � Craig Robinson , an Iowa Republican strategist , dubbed the Rubio campaignâ€ ™ s move as â€œpretty savvyâ€
�
given the obstacles Rubio will face if he is successfully defined as being â€œpro - amnestyâ€ � .
â€œNow
itâ€ ™ s
Cruz that has to do the explaining , â€ � Robinson said .
â€œCruz is the one who has to say how his position is really all that different from what Rubioâ€ ™ s position is , which puts him at odds with some of the more conservative candidates in the race.â€ �
â€œThis is new to a lot of people.â€ �"
2015-12-23,"Donald Trump has pulled further ahead of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination , as he heads towards 2016 with a 21-point lead , according to a new CNN poll .
Ted Cruz has also surged into a clear second place , leaving others trailing far behind .
Since the last Republican debate of the year last week , and his comments that Muslims should be banned from entering the US , Trump has become more popular .
The New York real estate mogul has topped the latest poll with 39 % support from registered GOP voters and Republican - leaning independents , an analysis on Wednesday morning from CNN / ORC revealed .
Thatâ€ ™ s twice as much support as his closest rival , Ted Cruz , who has nevertheless risen two points since the last poll to reach 18 %
â€ “ 21 points behind Trump .
In the previous CNN / ORC survey taken in late November , Trump was at 36 % and , on the far horizon , three others were bunched fairly closely together to make a small but important second - placed pack :
Cruz with 16 % , Ben Carson with 14 % and Marco Rubio with 12 % .
All of the other contenders were polling below 5 % .
In the latest poll , Carson and Rubio have slid , both standing at 10 % behind Cruzâ€ ™ s 18 % .
The next contender is New Jersey governor Chris Christie , at 5 % , followed by Rand Paul at four and Jeb Bush at three .
Trump has been unassailably on top of the polls since he first took the lead in July .
With less than six weeks to go until the first official nominating contests begin with the Iowa caucus , followed swiftly by the crucial opening primary in New Hampshire , the more establishment Republican candidates are crisscrossing the New England state in an effort to crack Trumpâ€ ™ s lead .
In the CNN poll , 46 % of GOP voters say the Republicans have a better chance of winning the White House in 2016 with Trump as their nominee ; but a greater percentage of those polled think another candidate would clinch the nomination .
The remaining problem for Trumpâ€ ™ s rivals is that voters are split on who that should be .
Cruz has bolstered his strength in the runner - up position .
A quarter said they would support the Texas senator if they chose someone other than Trump , followed by Rubio at 16 % and Carson at 13 % .
When respondents were asked who had the right experience to be president , Wednesdayâ€ ™ s poll found Cruz leapfrogged Trump and was by far the favorite with 62 % , ahead of Trumpâ€ ™ s 57 % and third - placed Rubio at 53 % .
Significantly for the national race , a Quinnipiac poll on Tuesday found that half of US voters say they would be embarrassed if Trump were elected president ."
2015-12-23,"The weather has finally cooled a bit , and that can only mean one thing : time for Ted Cruz to dump his ill - fitting suits and ties for his even iller - fitting collection of flannel shirts and leather jackets .
The # Cruz Country Christmas Tour ( in a private jet ) is under way and headed to a town near you .
Why does the Texas senator lumberjack around America when the temperature drops ?
Is he trying to create synergy with the cover of his latest book ?
Thatâ€ ™ s possible , but the real reason Ted Cruz wears flannel shirts and leather jackets in the winter is because he wants nothing more than to be perceived as one of the guys .
Not just because it could win him the White House , but because heâ€ ™ s always been that kid in school that had no friends .
The one whose parents made him insufferable by constantly telling him how much better he is than everyone else .
Cruzâ€ ™ s father , Rafael , has been brainwashing his son since he was about four years old to believe heâ€ ™ s â€œgifted above any man he knowsâ€
� and â€œdestined by God for greatnessâ€ � , the kinds of delusions that were guaranteed to get him stuffed in a locker by junior high .
Unfortunately , training to become Daddyâ€ ™ s little messiah didnâ€ ™ t leave Cruz time to develop even the slightest sense of style , and GQ has some stern fashion advice for him .
â€œIn general , weâ€ ™ re not exactly sure why presidential hopefuls think that oversized , awkward leather jackets will make them seem more , â€˜relatable to votersâ€ ™ ,â€
�
the website said on Tuesday .
First , the jacket just doesnâ€ ™ t fit .
If youâ€ ™ re looking for one , make sure the shoulder seams hit at your actual shoulders and thereâ€ ™ s not so much fabric pooling around your elbows ( a slimmer cut would fix that ) .
Second , itâ€ ™ s also a bizarrely vague style , neither a bomber nor a cafe - type racer .
Cruz opted for a nondescript zip - front jacket that we think calling basic might be too complimentary .
Even that weird , animatronic twang Cruz speaks with , despite having grown up in urban Houston attending private schools , raised by his Canadian mom and Cuban - accented dad , is a sad attempt to make you think heâ€ ™ s a regular working stiff .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
So he pretends to fit in with blue - collar types , but he was also pretending when in the company of his supposed milieu .
Ever since Cruz came on the national , political stage in 2013 , his freshman roommate at Princeton has been tweeting college memories of the junior senator , and not in a good way .
â€œI begged them for a different room or roommate .
Begged .
They didnâ€ ™ t understand then .
They do now ,
â€ � Craig Mazin tweeted about Cruz in 2013 .
Mazin is a professional screenwriter and avowed anti - Cruzite . â€œI would rather have anybody else be the president of the United States .
Anyone , â€ � he told The Daily Beast .
â€œI would rather pick somebody from the phone book.â€ �
Of course , not everyone at Princeton hated Cruz .
The other dorks on the debate team thought he was a master debater and a â€œsort of studâ€ � with girls on the debate circuit .
( Hoo boy . )
Cruzâ€ ™ s debate style meant he didnâ€ ™ t respond to arguments , but reframed them so he could control the conversation .
Erik Leitch , who lived in the same building as Cruz , saw that style bleed over into his personal interactions .
â€œThe only point of Ted talking to you was to convince you of the rightness of his views , â€ � Leitch said in the same Daily Beast piece .
So , Cruz was a weird kid saddled with a messiah complex who didnâ€ ™ t fit in with the liberal , Ivy League intellectuals in college .
Surely he finally found his peer group when he got to Washington , right ?
Political strategist Matthew Dowd , who worked with Cruz on the George W Bush campaign , tweeted that â€œif truth serum was given to the staff of the 2000 Bush campaignâ€ � , an enormous percentage of them â€œwould vote for Trump over Cruzâ€ � .
â€œI
just donâ€ ™ t like the guy , â€ � George W Bush himself said of Cruz at a political fundraiser for his baby brother Jeb .
Well , sure , but heâ€ ™
s just saying that because of his brother , surely .
â€œThe tenor of what he said about the other candidates was really pretty pleasant , â€ � one donor at the party said of Bush .
â€œUntil he got to Cruz.â€ �
And Bush is certainly not the only Republican willing to go on the record with his hatred for Cruz .
â€œThe list of GOP politicians and operatives willing to take open shots at Cruz has grown long , â€ � says the Washington Post , listing Senators John McCain , Rand Paul , Lindsey Graham , John Cornyn and John Thune , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , former House speaker John Boehner and former senator Tom Coburn , for starters .
It looks like a flannel shirt and a leather jacket arenâ€ ™ t going to be enough to overhaul Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s image .
Heâ€ ™ d need some idea of who he really is instead of who heâ€ ™ s trying to be to win over voters ."
2016-01-04,"Marco Rubio on Monday framed the presidential election as a choice that would define Americaâ€ ™ s role on the global stage .
In doing so , he took direct aim at both Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s record as secretary of state and Republican candidates he called â€œisolationistsâ€ � .
In response , a spokeswoman for one such opponent , Senator Ted Cruz , called Rubioâ€ ™ s stance on foreign policy â€œincoherentâ€ � and â€œdangerousâ€ � .
Wrapping a visit to New Hampshire , which will hold the first presidential primary in just over a monthâ€ ™ s time , Rubio accused Clinton of lying in her response to the September 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi .
He also called her â€œincompetentâ€ � and criticised her policy regarding Russia and Syria .
But the senator , polling in the top tier of a crowded Republican field , reserved some of his sharpest criticism for his own party .
Although he did not mention any candidate by name , he took subtle shots at Cruz , Kentucky senator Rand Paul and the frontrunner , Donald Trump .
â€œOn the other side of this election is the party of Reagan , the party of strong national defense and moral clarity , â€ �
he said .
â€œYet we have Republican candidates who propose that rulers like [ Syrian president Bashar al- ]
Assad and [ Russian president Vladimir ]
Putin should be partners of the United States , and who have voted with Barack Obama and Harry Reid rather than with our men and women in uniform .
â€œWe have isolationist candidates who are apparently more passionate about weakening our military and intelligence capabilities than about destroying our enemies.â€ �
Of Saudi Arabia cutting diplomatic ties with Iran , amid regional anger over the Saudi regimeâ€ ™ s execution of an Iranian cleric , Rubio told reporters after his speech that despite his not being â€œa big fan of the judicial system in Saudi Arabiaâ€ � , â€œour response should be to stand with our alliesâ€ � .
â€œOne of the things
thatâ€ ™ s hurt this country in the Middle East
has been this presidentâ€ ™ s betrayal of our allies in favor of Iran with this deal , â€ �
he said , referring to the multinational agreement regarding Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear ambitions .
â€œThe other thing , â€ � he continued , â€œis
it [ the situation with Saudi Arabia ] reveals the true nature of the criminal government that governs Iran â€
“ they allowed protesters to storm a diplomatic facility .
â€œThey allowed them to storm a wing or section of the Saudi embassy and trash it , and it just gives you an indication of who weâ€ ™ re dealing with here , which is a country that has no respect for international laws , has no respect for norms of governance.â€ �
As the start of voting approaches , Rubio has been especially critical of Cruz and Paul on national security â€ “ namely their support for ending the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s bulk collection of phone records .
As president , Rubio said , he would not only restore the NSAâ€
™ s
authorities but strengthen them .
â€œIsis does not use carrier pigeons to communicate , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThey use sophisticated encryption and carefully secured networks .
It was already difficult to infiltrate them ; now it is even harder.â€ �
Like Rubio , Cruz is a first - term senator of Cuban descent with a strong hold over grassroots conservatives .
In his stump speech , Rubio often questions Cruz , if never by name , for suggesting he would â€œcarpet bomb Isis into oblivion â€ ¦ until the sands glowâ€ � .
On Monday , Rubio said â€œwords and political stunts can not ensure our securityâ€ � ; nor could Isis â€œbe filibusteredâ€ � . â€œWhile
some claim they would destroy Isis , that they would make the sands of the Middle East â€˜glow in the darkâ€ ™ , my question is :
â€˜With what?â€ ™ â€ �
Rubio said , before charging some of his Republican opponents with voting to lower defense cuts .
Later on Monday , in response to Rubioâ€ ™ s speech , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign offered its own assessment of the senatorâ€ ™ s worldview .
â€œSo Rubioâ€ ™ s foreign policy and national security strategy
is to invade Middle Eastern countries , create power vacuums for terrorist organizations , allow their people to come to America unvetted , give them legal status and citizenship , then impose a massive surveillance state to monitor the problem , â€ �
Alice Stewart , a national spokeswoman for Cruz , said in a statement to the Guardian .
â€œIâ€ ™ m trying to figure out if it is more incoherent than dangerous or vice versa.â€ � Alex Conant , a Rubio spokesman , hit back : â€œNo amount of false rhetoric will cover up the fact that Cruz voted for Rand Paulâ€ ™ s isolationist budget to slash military spending and gut US intelligence programs .
Cruz might talk tough , but he would endanger America by partnering with rulers like Assad and Putin .
Marco has consistently fought to strengthen Americaâ€ ™ s military , intelligence programs and border security , and as president his top priority will be to keep Americans safe.â€ �
National security , a top priority among Republican voters , has been central to Rubioâ€ ™ s platform .
Since the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , he has cited his knowledge of foreign policy as what separates him from the rest of the Republican field â€ “ he sits on the influential Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees .
His opponents have pointed out that several of Rubioâ€ ™ s congressional backers also voted in favor of reforming the NSA , and by pointing to his vote in the foreign relations committee against authorizing US strikes in Syria in 2013 .
After his speech on Monday Christina Reynolds , a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign , accused Rubio of hypocrisy .
â€œMarco Rubioâ€ ™ s attempts to curry favor among the Republican base by blasting Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration on foreign policy are ironic considering he backed many of the very policies he now points to as problematic , â€ �
Reynolds said in a statement .
â€œRubio supported the US intervention in Libya , saying the administration â€˜did the right thingsâ€ ™ .
At various points , Rubio supported arming the moderate opposition in Syria , a position Hillary Clinton advocated .
And in fact , when President Obama sought congressional authorization to strike Syria for using chemical weapons on their own people , which Hillary Clinton supported , it was Marco Rubio who voted against it.â€ �
Rubio has defended that vote by saying the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s proposal to launch air strikes against Assad would have been â€œcounterproductiveâ€ � , while additional air power deployed against Isis would be appropriate .
On Monday , Rubio said he has been clear about his aim to confront Isis : â€œWhen you vote for me , you know exactly what youâ€ ™ ll get .
Youâ€ ™ ll get a president who will destroy terrorists overseas by authorizing whatever tools our commanders need.â€ �
And as the Pentagon prepares to transfer more detainees from GuantÃ¡namo Bay in the coming week , Rubio vowed to fully utilize the facility for interrogation and imprisonment â€ “ including of American citizens .
â€œWhen
I am president , foreign terrorists caught overseas will receive a one - way ticket to GuantÃ¡namo , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œAnd if youâ€ ™ re an American who has committed the ultimate act of betrayal against our country , I will have no qualms about treating you like the enemy combatant
you are if you have actionable information and refuse to cooperate.â€ �"
2016-01-06,"Donald Trump cast doubt on Republican candidate Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility for the presidency on Tuesday , on the basis that he may not be a natural - born US citizen .
In an interview with the Washington Post , Trump said the fact that Cruz was born in Canada was a â€œvery precarious one for Republicans because heâ€ ™ d be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision .
You donâ€
™ t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head.â€
�
The Republican frontrunner went on to claim a â€œlot of people are talking about â€ ¦ the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport.â€ � Cruz , whose campaign declined to comment , was born in Calgary in 1971 .
Although his father Rafael was not an American citizen at the time , his Delaware - born mother , Eleanor , was .
Article II of the US constitution requires that â€œno person except a natural born Citizen â€ ¦ shall be eligible to the Office of President.â€ �
However , legal scholars have long interpreted natural born citizen to refer to whether someone acquired their citizenship at birth , not the geographic location where they were born .
As a result , Cruz , who was a citizen at birth , is a natural born citizen .
Cruz has been reluctant to directly engage Trump during the Republican debate season , however this episode did prompt a feisty tweet from the senator from Texas .
He posted as his response â€œ@realDonaldTrump calling into question my natural - born citizenship , â€ � with a YouTube clip of the character Fonzie from Happy Days â€œjumping
the sharkâ€ � .
This moment was seen as an irreversible downward turn for the showâ€ ™ s quality and has spawned the phrase â€œjumping the sharkâ€
� for the moment when a once - successful product permanently goes wrong .
Cruz declined to go beyond that tweet in a gaggle with reporters in Iowa on Tuesday .
â€œI am going to stick with Fonzie jumping the shark , â€ � he said .
The senator added : â€œI like Donald Trump .
I like everyone.â€ �
Cruz was asked at a November campaign stop in Chariton , Iowa , about the circumstances of his birth .
Cruz said : â€œAs a legal matter it is plain as day that a child of a US citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen .
So will people raise this for political mischief ?
Sure ,
itâ€ ™ s
politics , thatâ€ ™ s what they do , but as a legal matter â€ ¦
itâ€ ™ s quite straightforward and
I donâ€ ™ t believe there is any impediment whatsoever.â€ � Trump , who was one of the most vocal â€œbirthersâ€ � pushing the false claim that Barack Obama was born in Kenya â€ “ which incidentally would still have made him a natural born citizen â€ “ has questioned Cruzâ€ ™ s citizenship in the past .
In 2013 , he told ABC Newsâ€ ™ Jonathan Karl that the Texas senator might not be eligible to be president .
â€œIf he was born in Canada , then perhaps not .
That will be ironed out .
I donâ€
™ t know the circumstances .
If he says he was born in Canada , thatâ€ ™ s his thing.â€
�
A few Democrats have also questioned Cruzâ€ ™ s citizenship .
Florida congressman Alan Grayson called Cruz â€œa Canadianâ€ � in 2014 and said he was not eligible to serve in the White House ."
2016-01-08,"Donald Trump has eclipsed the coverage in the US media of every major global story , according to a study by a fellow of the Washington - based think - tank , the Cato Institute .
â€œIn December , â€ � writes Cato fellow Trevor Thrall , â€œTrump appeared in twice as many stories as both Ted Cruz , his closest competitor in both the polls and coverage , and President Obama .
â€œSimply put ,
Trump is incredibly newsworthy given the way in which American news outlets define news and given the news Americans appear to want.â€ � And further proof of this phenomenon comes with Time magazineâ€ ™ s latest issue , featuring a cover story headlined â€œHow Trump won.â€
�
That means he has won more poll support than any other Republican presidential contender , of course .
But it also means he has won more media time and space than anyone else .
In her letter to readers , Timeâ€ ™ s editor , Nancy Gibbs , writes that Trump â€œhas defied every convention and conviction about how politics works and has surfed atop the polls for five months.â€ �
The magazineâ€ ™ s editor - at - large , David Von Drehle , argues that in the coming Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary , where Trump and Cruz are likely to emerge as front - runners , the Republican party must choose between â€œa bombshell and a kamikaze.â€ �
But Trump is favourite among several of the interviewees quoted in the article .
Greg Casady , a 61-year - old Army veteran from Iowa , says : â€œItâ€ ™ s time for us to do a totally insane thing ... because nothing else is working.â€ �
And Teresa Raus , also from Iowa , says : â€œI feel real confident that he can make America better .
I believe
himâ€
¦ Iâ€ ™ m sick of politicians.â€
�
Trump , described by Von Drehle as a â€œpot - stirring plutocratâ€ � , has managed to convince Americans that he is an apolitical outsider .
The writer concludes that he â€œmay well steamroll through winter into spring with the lionâ€ ™ s share of the delegatesâ€ � and the partyâ€ ™ s
officials â€œwonâ€ ™ t stop Trump because they canâ€ ™ t stop Trump.â€ �
And the media has , even if unconsciously , played a large part in his forward motion .
For Thrall , writing on Huffington Post , Trump has shown an â€œuncanny ability to set the news agenda.â€ �
Why ?
Because of his â€œtendency to make outrageous statements , tapping into anger and frustration in the electorate.â€
�
Sure , but also because TV and newspapers lap up outrage , seeing it as newsworthy .
In so doing , argues Thrall , Trump has already changed the debate about foreign and domestic policy .
His statements about Isis , for example , have fostered â€œan increasingly hawkish toneâ€ � among his Republican rivals .
It has also encouraged Hillary Clinton â€œto take a more aggressive stance ...
The end result is that public approval for military intervention against Isis is at an all - time high.â€ �
Similarly , â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s rhetoric has shifted the debate about borders and refugees in a decidedly nativist direction.â€ �
First , it involved the US - Mexican border .
Then , and especially after the Paris attacks , it moved on to the Syrian refugee crisis .
The effect ?
â€œIt will be surprising if the United States manages to take in even the 10,000 refugees President Obama originally promised and it seems extremely unlikely that the next president will suggest taking in any additional refugees.â€ � Thrallâ€ ™ s conclusion should be taken to heart : â€œIn a Trump - dominated news environment the world loses its complexity and we lose the ability to ground foreign policy in a realistic and sophisticated debate about how to meet the challenges we face .
Though election watchers remain doubtful that Trump will wind up the Republican nominee , 2016 begins with Trump in first place both in the national polls and in news coverage .
And whether Trump wins a single caucus or primary , the echoes of his campaign will be felt for a long time to come.â€ �
Meanwhile , in Britain , Trumpâ€ ™ s popularity and his media dominance remains mystifying .
UK news media - newspapers , TV and radio - have sometimes treated his more outrageous claims with undue seriousness .
Did the Daily Telegraph really think Trumpâ€ ™ s threat to withdraw nearly Â£700 m million of investment in Britain was worthy of a giant front page headline on Thursday ?
But that was relatively unusual .
Most of the articles about Trump have treated him as a form of entertainment , implying that no - one could possibly take the man seriously .
Underlying this viewpoint is a widely - held belief among all sections of the British populace that the average American lacks the sophistication of the average Briton .
In this sense , I guess there was a grain of truth in Rupert Murdochâ€
™ s 21 December tweet , in which he berated â€œLondon elites , media , etcâ€ � for â€œsneering at Trump.â€
�
He added : â€œNo understanding of mid - America conditions or politics.â€ �
Then again , and this surely is the point , it is difficult for editors , whether in the United States or Britain , to know quite how to handle Trump .
As much as they might wish to ignore him , that has been impossible ( not least because it ignores his popularity and would reek of censorship ) .
Giving him due measure , however , even when deriding him , plays into his hands by giving him the oxygen of publicity on which his populism feeds ."
2016-01-09,"Ted Cruz reaches the dramatic climax of his pitch to voters with a flourish that is as subtle as it is selfless .
After asking them to vote , he also asks them to pray .
Every day , between now and the Iowa caucuses in just three weeks .
And not just for victory , but for salvation .
â€œFather God please keep this awakening growing , â€ � he told a devoted crowd at the Praise Community church in Mason City on Friday .
â€œKeep this revival growing .
Awaken the body of Christ that we might rise up to pull this country back from the abyss.â€ � Standing in front of a distressed wooden crucifix , flanked by an electronic drum kit and keyboard , the Texas senator is not just the candidate most likely to save the country from a Donald Trump nomination .
He is the savior of an exceptional and divinely ordained nation , brought to the precipice of the Obama abyss .
When the chorus of amens dies down , Cruz takes his flock to an ecstatic finale by casting himself in the starring role of the Second Coming of Ronald Reagan .
He solemnly raises his right hand and places his left hand on an imaginary Bible , as he re - enacts the 1981 inauguration , with the holy book open at the same page from Second Chronicles .
â€œIf my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves in prayer and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , â€ � he intones , along with his audience , â€œthen I will hear their prayers , and will forgive their sins and I will heal their land.â€ �
He stretches his lips across his teeth into a forced smile , as his congregation gives him the third standing ovation of the morning .
( The first two having been for his promises to destroy Isis and mount some kind of insurrection in Washington . )
Nobody votes for a self - effacing candidate .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s aura of smug sanctimony , like his lack of humility , is striking even in an age of Trumpery .
After several months of some kind of mutual non - aggression pact , Trump finally turned on Cruz last week by questioning his status as a natural - born citizen who is constitutionally eligible to serve as president .
Cruz , who was born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father , merely chuckled at the attack as confirmation of his political status .
â€œThree weeks ago , just about every Republican in the field was attacking Donald Trump on a non - stop basis , â€ � he told reporters in a frigid airport hangar in Webster City , Iowa .
â€œToday just about every Republican in the field is attacking me .
That suggests the dynamics of this race has changed.â€ �
For his campaign , the dynamics of the race roll along two - lane roads through snow - crusted cornfields .
On an exhaustive six - day bus tour , the first - term Texas senator is â€ “ in the words of his campaign â€ “ Cruzinâ€ ™ to Caucus .
It is unclear why his otherwise crack political team has picked up this particular pun .
Perhaps they enjoyed the schlocky movie where Al Pacino is an undercover cop tracking down a homicidal homophobe in the gay bars of 1970s New York .
Or maybe they were thinking of the smoochy Smokey Robinson number where heâ€ ™ s cruisinâ€ ™ together with his baby .
It would have made more sense had they stuck to the language that drips from the candidate like so many souvenirs at Lourdes .
Judging from the polls , he is Cruzifyinâ€ ™ to victory in the first presidential contest .
And if Trump collapses under the weight of his own hairdo , the senator might just be Cruzadinâ€ ™ to the nomination â€ “ and almost certain defeat in the general election .
Rafael Edward Cruz is shrewd enough to build his campaign on more than just an evangelical sermon or two .
He rails against illegal immigration , against the â€œbipartisan corruptionâ€ � of what he calls the Washington cartel , and against government regulation .
He picks and chooses his red meat from all corners of the conservative menu : a libertarian dream to return to the gold standard , a nativist drive to end sanctuary cities , a business goal to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency , a home - schoolerâ€ ™ s hatred of Common Core education standards , a John Birch conspiracy theory against the world .
This leads to some glaring inconsistencies .
It is hard to be pro - business but also want to issue currency in line with the value of gold bars .
It is hard to win Iowa farming votes while opposing all subsidies , including those for corn - based ethanol .
He is far stronger when he stops talking policy and wraps himself in the flag .
Or wraps the flag in the Turin shroud and settles in for a good night of prayer .
In the Church of Cruz , American exceptionalism is being destroyed by same - sex marriage , the persecution of Christians , Planned Parenthood and Obamacare .
In particular , jihadis are terrorizing Americans either with the prior knowledge of the Obama administration , or thanks to its complete incompetence .
For his followers , the links are obvious , and the threats are everywhere .
One questioner in Webster City asked the candidate about the Trilateral Commission conspiracy to rule the world ; Cruz answered by bragging about a case where he struck a blow against the international court of justice in the case of a particularly brutal Mexican rapist and murderer .
The two have nothing to do with one another , but thatâ€ ™ s not the point .
This is a broad church of believers in Americaâ€ ™ s more obscure enemies .
Another voter asked about an attempted beheading â€ “ in sleepy downtown Des Moines â€ “ of a Muslim woman who wanted to remove her burqa .
The questioner appeared to refer to a domestic dispute in 2010 , but no matter .
He asked Cruz if he would ban sharia law in the United States , and mercifully the senator said he would .
This is the Texasification of American politics : a process that started with the previous governor , Rick Perry , but ended up with the current wing - nut extremism of Governor Greg Abbott .
Abbott was previously the stateâ€ ™ s attorney general , and he hired Cruz to be his solicitor general as they took their constitutional arguments across the country .
One of their landmark victories was to defend a monument of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol .
Abbott this week proposed a new constitutional convention to add nine amendments to the supreme law of the land , to curb the power of the federal government and the supreme court itself .
This kind of politics makes the last Texas president look like a bleeding - heart liberal and international statesman .
In place of George W Bushâ€ ™ s compassionate conservatism , Cruz and his allies lament the way that compassion can interfere with the law .
Cruz traveled on his bus tour with Representative Steve King , the Iowa congressman famous for suggesting that undocumented immigrants have â€œgot calves the size of cantaloupes because theyâ€ ™ re hauling 75lbs of marijuana across the desertâ€ � .
King has a similarly buffoon - like quality on stage as he does in interviews .
Whenever Cruz praised him for his hardline position against immigration , King mugged for the crowd by pointing to himself , grinning , and giving himself two thumbs up .
In church this week , King said that although he loved Reagan , he was angry that the president had signed a 1986 amnesty law for illegal immigrants .
He expected the president to know that â€œthe rule of law was more important than our compassionâ€ � .
The lack of feeling tends to go both ways in todayâ€ ™ s Republican party .
There is an unkind joke among Cruzâ€ ™ s colleagues on Capitol Hill : why do so many people take an instant dislike to him ?
Because it saves time .
The butt of the joke takes pride in this kind of rejection .
Cruz cares not that his fellow Republicans hate him for engineering a government shutdown in 2013 over yet another failed attempt to defund Obamacare .
That shutdown was opposed by 81 % of the American people , but Cruz â€ “ whose marathon Senate speech included a reading of Green Eggs and Ham by Dr Seuss â€
“ believes it set the stage for the bigger victories to come .
Cruz is shrewd enough to have built a best - in - class campaign in Iowa , and nationally , with every interaction underscoring his brand of firebrand politics .
After all , his campaign logo is a ball of fire in stars and stripes , underscoring a slogan about Courageous Conservatives
Reigniting the Promise of America .
When Cruz emails you for money , he doesnâ€ ™ t just tell you to give him your credit card details .
He asks instead for a quickie sacrifice .
â€œRunning for president of the United States has been a HUGE sacrifice , â€ � he recently wrote his fellow conservatives , before urging them to make their own sacrifices .
â€œTo make it as quick and easy as possible , Iâ€ ™ ve asked my staff to put together the secure links below so you can make an instant , secure sacrificial gift
â€ “ it can be done in five minutes or less.â€
�
At the Praise church in Mason City , pastor Jeff Dahlin ( hobbies : cooking , reading , stained glass art , and hunting ) sounded like there was nothing quick or easy about Cruz .
The pastor liked his faith , but he loved his fight .
â€œI like Ted Cruz because I think heâ€ ™ s really fighting the battles not just against the Democrats , but against the Republican party as well , â€ �
he said after the Cruz town hall .
â€œI
havenâ€ ™ t
seen that with the other candidates .
I am very frustrated with the party .
They campaign on promises and
then donâ€ ™ t do what they said they would do.â€
�
Cruz may not have passed any legislation but he can say he kept his promise to frustrate the establishment .
The Cruz conundrum is whether a candidate can successfully run against his own party and still win its nomination .
Among the communities of faith in Iowa , that may be possible .
But it would be another kind of miracle for the Gospel according to Cruz to spread across the nation ."
2016-01-10,"Marco Rubio tore into his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination on Sunday , suggesting that Ted Cruz helped Isis by limiting US surveillance powers and that an elected Chris Christie would amount to a third term for Barack Obama .
Rubio and Cruz have increasingly traded barbs as they have steadily risen in the polls behind the Republican frontrunner , Donald Trump .
And as the early state contests draw closer , the two first - term senators , from Florida and Texas respectively , have sharpened their attacks .
On Sunday Rubio emphasized a sharp disagreement with Cruz on the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s power to sweep up phone records and metadata .
â€œThere is no doubt that groups like Isis will benefit from us having a diminished intelligence capacity , â€ �
Rubio said in an interview with ABCâ€ ™ s This Week .
He added that he stood by an earlier claim that the terrorist group would have supported the surveillance bill if it had lobbyists in Washington .
Rubio then noted that Cruz had praised Edward Snowden , the former NSA contractor who leaked surveillance documents to the Guardian in 2013 .
â€œI never believed Edward Snowden was a good public servant the way that Ted Cruz once said , that he had done a public service for America , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œHe took our intelligence information and gave it to the Chinese and gave it to the Russians .
We can not afford to have a commander - in - chief who thinks people like Edward Snowden are doing a good public service.â€ �
Snowden has said that he lost possession of the tens of thousands of documents when he gave them to journalists , before he sought asylum in Russia .
Neither the US nor UK have ever publicly claimed that Russia or China gained access to Snowdenâ€ ™ s cache before he handed it over to journalists , though disputed reports have alleged as much .
The debate over security versus privacy in the US has calmed since 2013 , with fewer outcries of betrayal and more interest in reforms .
But many in Congress and the intelligence agencies are still seeking vengeance .
And while Cruz has criticized Rubio for his role in an immigration reform bill in 2013 that included a pathway to citizenship , the Florida senator fired back on Sunday that Cruz had â€œchanged his position on immigration all over the placeâ€ � .
â€œHe used to be for birthright citizenship , now he says heâ€ ™ s against it .
He used to be for legalizing people that were here illegally .
Now he says heâ€ ™ s against it , â€ � Rubio said , adding that Cruz had also backed away from his support for doubling green cards and expanding the H1-B visa program for high - skilled workers .
â€œThis is not consistency
â€ “
this is calculation , as heâ€ ™
s changed this position on these issues as we get closer to election day , â€ � Rubio said .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign said Rubio was simply trying to distract from his role as the co - author of immigration reform .
Rubio helped shepherd the legislation through the Senate , but has since disavowed the approach in favor of a piecemeal plan that prioritizes border security .
â€œItâ€ ™ s understandable why Senator Rubio would launch these false attacks , â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s spokesman , Rick Tyler , told the Guardian .
â€œBut as much as he now regrets joining upâ€ � with Democrats , he continued , â€œthe record is exceptionally clear.â€
� â€œHe supported dangerous policies that would have encouraged more illegal immigration , left our border wide open , and allowed Syrian terrorists acting as refugees into the country , â€ � Tyler said , adding that Cruz â€œled the fightâ€ � against the bill .
â€œThe American people are not confused on these points no matter how many times Senator Rubio says otherwise.â€ �
In Iowa , which will hold its caucus on 1 February , Cruz has overtaken Trump in some recent polls .
In New Hampshire , the state to hold the first primary voting on 9 February , Rubio currently sits in second place behind the real estate mogul .
Nipping at Rubioâ€ ™ s heels in New Hampshire , according to a new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist poll released on Sunday , is the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie .
The pair have also engaged in a back - and - forth in recent weeks that has at times grown unusually testy .
In recent interviews , Christie said he did not think Rubio could â€œslime his way to the White Houseâ€ � and argued that Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton would â€œpat [ Rubio ] on the head and then cut his heart outâ€ � in a general election .
Asked for his response on Sunday , Rubio looked to frame Christieâ€ ™ s record as more in line with the Obama administration than that of a Republican .
â€œChris doesnâ€ ™ t want to have a debate about his record , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œChrisâ€ ™ s record , for a Republican , is not what we need.â€ �
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a supporter of Common Core .
Heâ€
™ s personally given a donation to Planned Parenthood .
Heâ€ ™ s a supporter of gun control , â€ � he added .
â€œThe last thing we need in our Republican nominee is someone who agrees with Obama and Hillary Clinton on many of the key issues before this country.â€ �
Christie has since reversed his stance on the issues Rubio cited , but said in his own interview on Sunday on CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation that he was â€œhappy to stand by my record of having made decisionsâ€ � .
â€œFor him to be trying to characterize my conservative record in that way is contrary to what Marco himself said ,
â€ �
Christie said of Rubio .
â€œMarco himself has said that I was a conservative reformer in New Jersey .
So hereâ€ ™ s the thing , Iâ€ ™ m not going to spend my time talking about Marco Rubio ,
OK?â€ �
Pressed nonetheless on whether he had contributed to Planned Parenthood , the womenâ€ ™ s health organization Republicans have looked to defund ,
Christie denied having done so .
â€œI
never donated to Planned Parenthood , so
thatâ€ ™ s wrong , â€ � he said .
The declaration runs counter to what Christie said in 1994 , while running for local office in New Jersey .
According to a Star - Ledger article from the time , Christie said : â€œI support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution , and that should be the goal of any such agency , to find private donations.â€ �
A spokeswoman for Christieâ€ ™ s campaign reiterated that the governor had not made a donation to Planned Parenthood when asked about the conflicting statements .
Christie , as governor , has repeatedly vetoed funding for Planned Parenthood and also supports defunding the organization at the federal level .
He has said he changed from pro - choice to pro - life after hearing the heartbeat of his unborn daughter in the mid-1990s ."
2016-01-10,"Ted Cruz once more dismissed claims from that he is not qualified to be president on Sunday , as Donald Trump and other Republicans question whether the former Canadian - American dual citizen is eligible to run .
â€œThe son of a US citizen born abroad is a natural - born citizen ,
â€ �
Cruz , the son of an American mother and a Cuban father who was born in Canada , told CNN in an interview broadcast on Sunday .
â€œThe internet has all sorts of fevered swamp theories , â€ � added Cruz , who renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014 , adding that his mother , a US citizen , had never voted in Canada .
He also called such accusations and questions from opponents distractions from the serious issues of a presidential campaign .
Cruz gave the interview on his campaign bus , during a tour through Iowa , where he leads the Republican field ahead of the stateâ€ ™ s 1 February caucuses .
An NBC poll released on Sunday put him at 28 % support to Trumpâ€ ™ s 24 % among likely caucus - goers .
Donald Trump , however , leads nationally and in the other key early voting state , New Hampshire .
This weekend , he continued to press the issue he first raised and other candidates have since discussed .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re not , â€ � the billionaire said , addressing the issue of whether Cruz was a natural - born citizen at a rally in Iowa on Saturday night .
â€œYou
canâ€
™ t have a person running for office , even though Ted is very glib and he goes out and he says , â€˜Oh , well , Iâ€ ™ m
a natural - born citizen.â€ ™
The point is , youâ€ ™ re not . â€œI mean , youâ€ ™ ve got to get a declaratory judgment , you have to have the courts come up with a ruling or you have a candidate who just can not run because the other side will immediately bring suit and youâ€ ™ ve got that cloud on your head.â€ �
Trump has repeatedly contended that if Cruz becomes the GOP nominee , Democrats will sue on constitutional grounds to prevent him from running .
The real estate magnate was asked about the comments , which have drawn comparison to the â€œbirtherâ€ � theories that question Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s right to be president , in an interview with NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press , to be broadcast on Sunday .
Asked whether he questioned Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility because of the senatorâ€ ™ s rising status in the polls , Trump said : â€œSo what happens is I was watching Laurence Tribe of Harvard yesterday , whoâ€ ™ s a constitutional expert , one of the true experts .
And according to him , itâ€ ™ s a real question mark .
â€œYou know , I would say he is one of the great authorities on this subject .
He has a question mark.â€ �
In 2008 Tribe , co - founder of the American Constitutional Society , concluded that John McCain , who was born in the Panama Canal Zone to American parents , was a natural - born US citizen and thus eligible to run for the White House .
This week , Tribe told ABC News he did not think the question was â€œsettled lawâ€ � , as â€œthe supreme court has never addressed the issue one way or the otherâ€ � .
That is the â€œreal question markâ€ � , Trump said .
Tribe , however , also told ABC : â€œMy own view as a constitutional scholar is that the better view , the one most consistent with the entire constitution , is the broader definition , according to which Cruz would be eligible.â€ �
That broader definition , Tribe said , would include anyone who was a US citizen at birth and did not need to be naturalised .
On NBC , Trump was not to be discouraged or deflected , although he and Cruz have had an unusually friendly relationship on a campaign trail marked by vitriol and animosity .
â€œLet me tell you , â€ � he said .
â€œFrom Tedâ€ ™ s standpoint and from the partyâ€ ™ s standpoint , he has to solve this problem .
Because the Democrats will sue him if heâ€
™ s the nominee .
If Ted is the nominee , he will be sued by the Democrats.â€ �
Regarding the motivation for Trumpâ€ ™ s attacks , during his own swing through Iowa Cruz told reporters : â€œI understand that a lot of candidates in the field are dismayed .
Theyâ€ ™ re dismayed because theyâ€ ™ re seeing conservatives uniting behind our campaign .
â€œAs that happens youâ€ ™
re seeing candidates trying to throw whatever rocks they can .
Thatâ€ ™ s
fine , thatâ€ ™ s their prerogative .
I like Donald Trump
, I respect Donald Trump ,
heâ€ ™ s welcome to toss whatever attacks he wants.â€
�
At his Saturday night rally in Clear Lake , Trump protested that he only wanted Cruz to legally confirm his right to run .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to win this way , â€ � he said .
â€œI want to win fair and square.â€ �"
2016-01-11,"Presidential candidate Marco Rubio escalated his criticism of his opponent Ted Cruz this week by suggesting a central component of the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s
tax plan was both â€œintentionally sneakyâ€ � and a â€œdangerous expansion of Washingtonâ€ ™ s powerâ€ � .
Although he did not mention Cruz by name , Rubio used an economic policy speech in his home state of Florida on Monday to suggest his rival would transform America into Europe by enacting a value - added tax ( VAT ) .
As if to rub salt in the wound , Rubio name - checked Republican hero Ronald Reagan as an opponent of a VAT and President Barack Obama as one of its proponents .
â€œBelieve it or not , multiple Republican candidates for president support new taxes on the American people , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œSome even support imposing a new tax that generations of conservatives have fought against , called a Value Added Tax â€ “ also known as a VAT .
â€œIt attempts to trick people into believing their taxes are being lowered , when in reality theyâ€ ™ re simply being shifted to employers â€ “ meaning everyday Americans would feel its impact through higher prices and lower wages.â€ �
Cruz has proposed to dramatically transform the existing tax code with a plan that would implement an individual 10 % flat tax on income and replace corporate income and all payroll taxes with a 16 % â€œBusiness Flat Taxâ€ � .
The latter is essentially a rebranded name for a value - added tax ( VAT ) , commonly used around the world but viewed with skepticism by many conservatives who see it as a vehicle for big government .
According to an analysis of Cruzâ€ ™ s tax plan by the conservative - leaning Tax Foundation , the US government â€œwould raise 71 % of all revenue from the new broad - based value - added tax , â€ � which would be levied on companiesâ€ ™ profits but not purchases from other businesses or capital investments .
Rubio on Monday said the implementation of a VAT in America would mirror Europe , where he argued the government has â€œgrown in sizeâ€ � â€œItâ€ ™ s no wonder that fans of the VAT include [ House Democratic leader ] Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama , who called it a â€˜novelâ€ ™ idea , â€ � the Florida senator said .
Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pushed back on Rubioâ€ ™ s characterization in a statement to the Guardian .
â€œAnyone who has read the Cruz plan knows it doesnâ€ ™ t feature a European - style national sales tax , â€ � Frazier said .
â€œInstead , his business flat tax is a proportionate tax on labor and capital , it dramatically simplifies taxes for businesses , and it is more competitive for capital investment and trade .
It allows us to eliminate numerous other taxes , flatten the income tax rate down to 10 percent and provides full expensing of business investment.â€ �
She added that Rubioâ€ ™ s attacks on Cruz were designed to change the conversation from his record on immigration .
â€œRather than misconstruing our tax plan ,
Marcoâ€ ™ s time is probably better served explaining to voters why he continues to support amnesty and has recently tripled - down on offering in - state tuition for those who are here illegally , â€ � Frazier said .
â€œThe reality is Marco will do and say anything to distract voters from his support for the Gang of Eight amnesty bill.â€ �
Rand Paul has also embraced a VAT , under the moniker of a â€œBusiness Transfer Taxâ€ � , but there was little doubt Rubioâ€ ™ s criticism was largely aimed at Cruz .
The two senators are competing in the early states behind Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , whereas Paul barely registers in most polling .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has , in the past , pointed to a number of influential conservatives who have embraced the idea of a VAT .
But Rubio argued that by renaming it a â€œBusiness Flat Taxâ€ � , Republican candidates were attempting to veil their support for the essence of the proposal .
â€œDonâ€
™ t be fooled , â€ � he said .
â€œIf it acts like a VAT , taxes like a VAT , and grows government like a VAT â€
“
itâ€ ™ s a VAT.â€ � Rubio also took thinly veiled jabs at the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , and former Florida governor Jeb Bush , again without invoking their names , for backing an internet sales tax .
â€œThe internet is the marketplace of the 21st century and itâ€ ™ s unacceptable that anyone who claims to be a conservative would join the liberal call for an online tax , â€ � Rubio said .
The senator added he did not support new taxes â€œof any kindâ€ � , and would look to reform entitlement programs such as Medicare and social security to solve the nationâ€ ™ s debt crisis .
Rubio introduced a plan last year that would eliminate taxes on interest , dividends and capital gains , lower the corporate tax rate to 25 % from 35 % and set the top rate on wage income to 35 % from 39.6 % .
The senatorâ€ ™ s opponents have said Rubioâ€ ™ s plan disproportionately favors the wealthy .
Rubio has also proposed creating a new , partially refundable child tax credit of up to $ 2,500 per child , and a tax break for employers that offer paid family leave ."
2016-01-11,"The legal and constitutional issues around qualification for the presidency on grounds of US citizenship are â€œmurky and unsettledâ€ � , according to the scholar cited by Donald Trump in his recent attacks on Ted Cruz .
Trump has sought to cast doubt on whether the senator , who was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father , is a â€œnatural - born US
citizenâ€ � .
In doing so he has referred to the work and words of Laurence Tribe , perhaps the most respected liberal law professor in the country .
Tribe taught both Cruz and Barack Obama at Harvard Law School .
He also advised Al Gore in the 2000 Florida recount and has advised Obamaâ€ ™ s campaign organisation .
â€œDespite Sen[ator ] Cruzâ€ ™ s repeated statements that the legal / constitutional issues around whether heâ€ ™ s a natural - born citizen are clear and settled , â€ �
he told the Guardian by email , â€œthe truth is that theyâ€ ™ re murky and unsettled.â€ �
Tribe has said previously that the question of Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility is â€œunsettledâ€ � .
On Sunday , Trump cited that position in an interview with NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press , in which he described Tribe â€œas a constitutional expert , one of the true expertsâ€ � .
At a rally in Reno , Nevada later on Sunday , the real - estate billionaire , who has said Democrats will sue to stop Cruz running should he win the nomination , described himself as â€œa PhD in litigationâ€ � .
Of Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility , he said : â€œThere is a doubt .
We canâ€ ™ t have a doubt.â€ � Article II , section I , clause V of the US constitution states : â€œNo Person except a natural born Citizen , or a Citizen of the United States , at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the Office of President.â€ �
In his emails to the Guardian , Tribe discussed Cruzâ€ ™ s own approach to constitutional issues , noting that under â€œthe kind of judge Cruz says he admires and would appoint to the supreme court â€ “ an â€˜originalistâ€ ™ who claims to be bound by the historical meaning of the constitutionâ€ ™ s terms at the time of their adoption â€ “ Cruz wouldnâ€ ™ t be eligible because the legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and 90s required that someone be born on US soil to be a â€˜natural bornâ€ ™ citizen.â€ �
He added : â€œEven having two US parents wouldnâ€ ™ t suffice for a genuine originalist .
And having just an American mother , as Cruz did , would clearly have been insufficient at a time that made patrilineal descent decisive .
â€œOn the other hand , to the kind of judge that I admire and Cruz abhors â€ “ a â€˜living constitutionalistâ€ ™ who believes that the constitutionâ€ ™ s meaning evolves with the needs of the time â€ “ Cruz would ironically be eligible because it no longer makes sense to be bound by so narrow and strict a definition.â€
�
Tribe said : â€œThere is no single , settled answer .
And our supreme court has never addressed the issue.â€ �
Trump , who trails Cruz in polls in Iowa , first raised the issue last week .
Cruz has since cited a bipartisan Harvard Law Review article by two former solicitor generals , Neal Katyal and Paul Clement , to back his contention that he is a natural - born citizen .
Some of his rivals have pushed back ; the Kentucky senator and presidential rival Rand Paul and Arizona senator John McCain , the 2008 candidate , have declined to support him .
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney , the Republican nominee in 2012 , tweeted on Friday that Cruz was indeed a â€œnatural - born citizenâ€ � .
Tribe , who became a hated figure to many on the right thanks to his role in derailing the supreme court nomination of Robert Bork in 1987 , gave legal advice to McCain when similar â€œnatural - born citizenâ€
� questions arose in 2008 .
McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone , to two Americans .
Working with Ted Olsen , a former solicitor general in the George W Bush administration , Tribe concluded : â€œ[McCainâ€ ™ s ]
birth on a US military base within a territory controlled by the US from 1903 to 1979 â€ ¦ under a treaty with Panama probably ( although not certainly ) qualified him as a natural born citizen , especially because both his parents were US citizens at the time.â€ �
On Sunday , he wrote : â€œThat situation differed greatly from the one Sen[ator ]
Cruz finds himself in.â€ �
Asked if he was surprised by Trumpâ€ ™ s use of his name , Tribe wrote : â€œWhat I find surreal isnâ€ ™ t that a Republican presidential candidate would favorably cite my legal conclusions , but that anyone should find that phenomenon so shocking .
â€œThe fact that Iâ€ ™ m a lifelong liberal and a registered Democrat who taught constitutional law to President Obama ( and , by the way , to Chief Justice Roberts and Senator Cruz ) makes my citation by a likely Republican nominee for president surprising only because our political divisions have become so profound and so paralyzing that people no longer believe in the possibility of disinterested legal research .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s really sad.â€ �"
2016-01-12,"With Ted Cruz emerging as a threat in Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s path to the Republican presidential nomination , the real estate mogul has looked to blunt Cruzâ€ ™ s momentum by questioning his eligibility to run for president because he was not born in the United States .
Cruz was born in Canada to an American - born mother .
But that hasnâ€ ™ t stopped Trump , who memorably fueled the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born in Kenya , from casting doubt on Cruzâ€ ™ s qualifications in the run - up to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary .
What is Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s background ?
Cruz was born in Calgary , Canada , in 1970 to Rafael Bienvenido Cruz and Eleanor Darragh .
His father was born in Cuba and was not a US citizen at the time of Cruzâ€ ™ s birth .
But his mother , Eleanor , was an American , born in Delaware , who never gave up her US citizenship .
According to Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign , she lived in Canada under a work permit and at no point applied for Canadian citizenship or permanent residence .
Cruz instantly acquired US citizenship when born and moved to the United States at the age of four .
In 2013 he released his birth certificate
â€ “ which prompted the Dallas Morning News to discover that the Texas senator was also a citizen of Canada based on his birthplace .
Cruz , who said he was until then unaware of his dual status , subsequently renounced his Canadian citizenship .
So is he eligible to run for president ?
Among the qualifications to run for president of the United States is the requirement that a candidate must be a â€œnatural born Citizenâ€ � .
Most legal experts have interpreted that to be anyone who is a citizen at birth and who did not need to undergo a naturalization process to obtain citizenship â€ “ a definition under which Cruz would qualify .
In a Harvard Law Review article , two former solicitor generals , Neal Katyal and Paul Clement , wrote : â€œDespite the happenstance of a birth across the border , there is no question that Senator Cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a â€˜natural born Citizenâ€ ™ within the meaning of the Constitution.â€ �
But some have pointed out that the supreme court has never addressed the question of eligibility for those seeking the presidency as it pertains to citizenship .
It was unlikely that the courts would even take up such a case , experts say , and it would be difficult for a citizen seeking to legally challenge a candidateâ€ ™ s qualifications to prove standing .
Laurence Tribe , a Harvard Law professor who taught both Cruz and Obama , said the constitutional questions surrounding Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility are â€œmurky and unsettledâ€ � .
But he added that the â€œarc of historyâ€ � has shown someone like Cruz to meet the qualifications .
How are politicians reacting ?
At least some of Cruzâ€ ™ s
Republican opponents , such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Florida senator Marco Rubio , have dismissed the notion that he is ineligible .
But not everyone has been as willing to come to Cruzâ€ ™ s defense .
Iowaâ€ ™ s Republican governor , Terry Branstad , sparked a new round of headlines on Monday by deeming the eligibility questions â€œfair gameâ€ � .
â€œWhen you run for president of the United States , any question is fair game .
So let the people decide , â€ �
Branstad told reporters at a press conference .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who is polling in low single - digit numbers in the Republican race , fanned the flames in several interviews
â€ “ even quipping that Cruz was qualified to be the prime minister of Canada .
Arizona senator John McCain , who faced similar scrutiny in his 2008 presidential bid over his birth on a US military base in the Panama Canal Zone , also raised eyebrows last week for asserting Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility â€œought to be looked atâ€ � .
McCain later walked back the comments by noting he was not passing judgement .
Reince Preibus , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , declined to weigh in altogether .
â€œListen
, I donâ€ ™ t get involved .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to get in the middle of all these candidate issues , â€ � he told Time .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a bad place for me to be .
Iâ€ ™ ll let all these folks argue about this stuff , and Iâ€ ™ m going to stay out of it.â€ � Cruzâ€ ™ s supporters have claimed that the Republican partyâ€ ™ s establishment wing is reluctant to defend the firebrand senator because they would rather he not secure the nomination .
Cruz has largely ignored the issue , telling reporters the matter is â€œsettledâ€ � .
How might the conversation affect his bid ?
Polling continues to show Cruz running neck - and - neck with Trump in Iowa , and there is little indication the birthplace chatter will affect his standing .
Reporters who followed the senator on a six - day , 28-county swing through the state last week said voters did not seem concerned with Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility .
But if Trump continues to amplify the subject , it could easily become a distraction for Cruz .
Trumpâ€ ™ s relentless focus on Cruz also puts the senator in a tough spot , given his reticence to criticize the Republican frontrunner in public .
â€œI like Donald Trump , I respect Donald Trump .
Heâ€ ™ s welcome to toss whatever attacks he wants ,
â€ �
Cruz told reporters in Iowa on Saturday .
Top Republicans could help Cruz quash the issue by rallying more forcefully to his defense .
But it is little secret that Cruz has few friends in Washington , many of whom are probably holding out hope for an alternative to prevail over both him and Trump as voters approach the process of selecting their nominee ."
2016-01-12,"Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s latest commercial , titled â€œInvasionâ€ � , now running in New Hampshire , claims the mainstream media refuses to cover immigrationâ€ ™ s economic ramifications â€ “ how it hurts local workers â€ “ because white - collar elites
canâ€
™ t relate to those whoâ€ ™ ve seen their wages drop .
( Ha ! )
Cruz then goes on to say that if heâ€ ™ s elected president , heâ€ ™ ll â€œtriple the border patrolâ€ � , build a wall â€œthat worksâ€ � and â€œsecure the borderâ€ � .
â€œSecure
the borderâ€ � is Ted Cruzâ€
™ s mantra .
He would have no political platform were it not for his ability to harness Americaâ€ ™ s combined fear and hatred of brown people .
Which would make him just like every other Republican huckster were it not for the fact that heâ€ ™ s been elected to represent the border region , yet he rarely shows his face there , let alone asks its residents whether they feel the need for three times the border patrol and a â€œwall that worksâ€ � , whatever that means .
None of this would be so noteworthy if Cruz werenâ€ ™ t literally banking his entire presidential campaign on â€œsecuringâ€ � this place with which he is barely acquainted .
I tried to verify with Cruzâ€ ™ s press people how many times heâ€ ™ s visited the border region , but they didnâ€ ™ t respond to multiple emails .
According to what I could find online , since Cruz took over as US senator representing Texas in 2013 , heâ€ ™ s only visited the entire Texas - Mexico border region â€ “ a distance of 1,254 miles â€ “ six times .
In the Rio Grande valley , he visited the McAllen area three times and Harlingen once .
Outside the valley , he visited Laredo once and El Paso once .
None of his visits lasted even 24 hours and as best I can tell , heâ€ ™ s never visited the largest city in the Rio Grande valley : my hometown , Brownsville .
Iâ€ ™ m not the only one whoâ€ ™ s noticed the fissure either .
A Texas Tribune article from March 2015 , â€œCruz Heavy on Border Rhetoric , Light on Tripsâ€ � , pointed out the dearth of Cruz visits to the border region , which then only numbered three .
By comparison , the article said , Texas senior Senator John Cornyn took 13 trips to the area in the same amount of time .
In the article , Steve Ahlenius , president and CEO of the McAllen chamber of commerce , lamented the fact that politicians like Cruz â€œparachuteâ€ � in to use the border as a â€œred - meat
issueâ€
� .
â€œThey donâ€
™ t come in with viable solutions that really kind of take into account the feedback , comments and ideas coming from the local area , as opposed to what they think someone in Iowa is going to want to hear , â€ �
Ahlenius told the Tribune , adding that the McAllen chamber of commerce invited Cruz to visit McAllen three separate times since he took office and was turned down each time .
Not coincidentally , Iâ€ ™ m sure , a Cruz fundraiser was set up just three months later in McAllen .
Cruz was in and out ( as always ) in less than a day .
This blatant marginalization by an elected official of one of Texasâ€ ™ s most populous regions didnâ€ ™ t stop Cruz from saying the following at the 2015 Heritage Action Conservative Policy Summit : One of the fun things in Washington is listening to Senate Democrats who live in states far , far , away from the border explain to those of us who live in states on the border how wonderfully secure the border really is .
I have a modest suggestion , perhaps we should move the White House down to the Rio Grande Valley .
I have a modest suggestion for Ted Cruz .
I dare him to spend a whole 24 hours in the Rio Grande valley talking to the people who live there , not holed up in some private fundraiser .
I dare him to look the people of Brownsville , Texas in the eyes and tell them about his plan to further militarize their home .
He wonâ€ ™ t do that , because the Rio Grande valley is one of the last Democratic strongholds in the state .
Cruz lost the election for senator in every major city along the border in 2012 and no Republican candidate for governor has garnered even half the vote along the border in decades .
Think about that for a second : the place that Republicans are bending over backwards to â€œsecureâ€ � wonâ€ ™ t vote for them .
Thatâ€ ™ s because the people of the border donâ€ ™ t want their home to be militarized .
You know what they want ?
Jobs .
â€œTraditional command and control measures do not address the principal root cause of illegal immigration and insecurity â€ “ poverty , insecurity and lack of opportunity , â€ � says a document from the Bi - national Economic Development ( BiNED ) initiative created by a coalition of border cities on both sides of the Rio Grande .
Instead , BiNED members say the solution is to â€œpromote a safe and prosperous border through targeted economic development and specifically through a bi - national advanced manufacturing strategy that encompasses the entire southwestern border with the US and Mexicoâ€ � .
Ted Cruz could hear this from them firsthand if heâ€ ™ d give up some of his trips to Iowa to visit the valley .
According to the site p2016 , which tracks presidential candidate campaigns , Cruz has taken at least one trip a month to Iowa since his 2013 election , sometimes multiple trips , usually for at least a few days at a time .
By the end of September 2015 , Cruz had visited Iowa 19 times for a total of 28 days .
And just the other day , Cruz wrapped his latest visit , a six - day bus tour of the state that was part of a pledge he made to Iowans to visit all 99 counties in that state .
As a Texan , a taxpayer and a native of the border region , I â€ “ and everyone
I grew up with â€
“ take the border situation very seriously .
And I take it personally when politicians like Ted Cruz barely show their faces in our community and then exploit the region for their own personal gain ."
2016-01-12,"Good evening , Mr Speaker Steve Scalise .
Good evening , members of Congress .
Good evening , Mr Vice - President Ted Cruz .
Hello to my fellow Americans .
In 2016 , Americans voted unanimously for Trump .
Donald Trump .
They saw that I would make America great again , and they saw this because of my baseball cap , which said on it : â€œMake America
Great Againâ€ � .
I also had T - shirts printed , which are still for sale on whitehouse.gov/shop .
I defeated Hillary Clinton .
She ran an OK race .
But in the end , voters were able to see what I had been saying all along : that Hillary Clinton is a woman .
A woman with feeble woman arms and a feeble womanâ€ ™ s brain .
I am a man with big strong arms and a great big brain .
I won .
Thatâ€ ™ s what I do : I win .
Already , my fellow Americans , the effects of the Trump presidency are visible .
In one of my first moves I rebranded the White House as the Trump House .
Then , I rebranded the Capitol as the Trump Capitol .
Next week , signage will be completed on the new Trump monument .
I promised I would introduce a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States .
After consultation with key aides I decided to extend that ban to Muslims and Hindus and Buddhists and all the other religions that my base of angry white men mistrust .
No longer will the United States be overrun by monks and joss sticks and those little statues of the fat man with the big ears .
I promised I would deport the illegals .
I have done that .
The vice - president is being transported to the Canadian border later tonight .
My fellow Americans , we are now a month into the Trump presidency .
One month .
And already people are saying I am one of the greatest presidents ever .
Roger Ailes has said it .
Tom Brady has said it .
I have said it .
Two weeks ago , we began to build the Trump wall on the Mexican border .
The Trump name stands for quality , and this wall is going to be of the highest quality , and of exquisite beauty .
For one thing , it will be covered in 40-foot - high pictures of Donald Trump , arms outstretched , finger pointing the illegals back toward their impoverished homes .
Three weeks ago I began work on my new book .
It will be about how I managed to become president .
How I alerted the nation to Vice - President Cruzâ€ ™ s Canadian - ism .
How I alerted the nation to the fact I consider Hillary Clinton to be unattractive .
How I threatened to punch Megyn Kelly following the first presidential debate .
It will be called the Art of the Election , by Donald Trump .
You can order it now on whitehouse.gov/shop .
There is already much to celebrate .
But there is much more to come .
I will continue to alienate China , Mexico , Russia and all the other countries in the world .
I will expand the range of Donald Trump products available at whitehouse.gov/shop .
And finally , my fellow Americans , I will return to host The Apprentice this coming fall , the first time a sitting president has done so ."
2016-01-13,"As Barack Obama sought to ease the fears of an anxious nation in his final State of the Union address , the Republicans seeking to replace him in the White House said it was the president who had sown divisions among the American public .
Presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , senators of Florida and Texas , respectively , reacted swiftly to Obamaâ€ ™ s address by criticizing both his tone and focus .
During an interview with Fox News , Rubio said Obama had â€œbitterly divided this country , and done so for his own gainâ€ � .
â€œThis president has been the single most divisive figure this country has had over the last decade , â€ � Rubio said .
In his own appearance on Fox , Cruz said the president was â€œout of touchâ€ � and more concerned with â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ � than with national security .
â€œThis was less a State of the Union than it was a state of denial , â€ � said Cruz , who chose to skip the address in favor of the campaign trail .
Although Obama did not mention any candidates by name , he dedicated a lengthy portion of his speech to what many interpreted as a rebuke of the Republican primary â€ “ particularly its tenor on immigration and refugees .
â€œAs frustration grows , there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes , to scapegoat fellow citizens who donâ€ ™ t look like us , or pray like us , or vote like we do , or share the same background , â€ � Obama said , in a clear reference to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
He went on to deliver a forceful critique of anti - Muslim rhetoric , while warning of the implications of ascribing the actions of terrorists to an entire faith .
â€œThis is not a matter of political correctness .
Itâ€ ™ s a matter of understanding what makes us strong ,
â€ � Obama said .
Many of the Republican candidates , including Rubio , Cruz and former Florida governor Jeb Bush , have consistently attacked Obama on the campaign trail for refusing to declare the war on terror as one with â€œradical Islamâ€ � .
As Obama spoke , Bush rejected the presidentâ€ ™ s characterization of terrorists as â€œkillers and fanaticsâ€ � . â€œTheyâ€ ™ re radical Islamic terrorists .
Still canâ€ ™ t call them by name , â€ � Bush tweeted .
While itâ€ ™ s not uncommon for Obama to use the bully pulpit to push back on the rhetorical arguments of Republican candidates , on Monday his message was augmented by the fact that he will soon be succeeded by a new leader .
And he appeared intent on shaping the final major speech of his presidency around not only a defense of the worldview that has defined his time in office , but also the record he hopes his successor will carry forward .
That included economic policies to combat income inequality , expand college affordability , further access to healthcare and education , and remove the influence of money and power from politics â€ “ all of which are central themes in the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .
Both Democratic candidates reacted to Obamaâ€ ™ s remarks on Twitter , with Clintonâ€ ™ s account expressing support for the presidentâ€ ™ s record with a warning that Republicans would â€œrip away [ his ] progressâ€ � .
Sanders said the speech was â€œimportantâ€ � , adding that â€œthe president reminded us not to be afraid of change , but to wield it to improve the lives of Americansâ€ � .
But to effect positive change , as was his hope when he arrived in Washington eight years ago , Obama urged those who may disagree with his agenda to , at the very least , step back from the doom - and - gloom that has taken hold of the 2016 race .
Alluding to the cautionary tales of American instability told by Republicans on the campaign trail , Obama offered a sharp rebuttal .
â€œI told you earlier all the talk of Americaâ€ ™ s economic decline is political hot air , â€ � he said .
â€œWell , so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker .
The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth .
Period .
Itâ€ ™ s not even close.â€ �"
2016-01-13,"Rand Paulâ€ ™ s presidential campaign has drafted in his father , libertarian icon Ron Paul , to directly attack Republican rival Ted Cruz in a robocall in Iowa , the first time the former presidential candidate has gone on the offensive on his sonâ€ ™ s behalf .
In the call , exclusively obtained by the Guardian , the former Texas congressman criticizes Cruz for missing a vote on Tuesday on a bill to audit the Federal Reserve .
Ron Paul says of Cruzâ€ ™ s decision : â€œThatâ€ ™ s not the type of leadership we need in the White House.â€
�
He adds : â€œI am Ron Paul , asking you to support real liberty - minded leadership and help elect Rand.â€ �
Cruz has long been trying to woo over the type of libertarian - oriented Republican who overwhelmingly backed Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012 .
He has gone out of his way to boast of his support for auditing the Fed on the debate stage and rolling back NSA surveillance while attacking neoconservatives in his own party who Cruz claims about pursuing military conflict with Iran are overeager .
As a result , the senator from Texas has been able to make significant inroads in the liberty wing of the Republican party , in particular , among more socially conservative libertarians .
A Cruz adviser told the Guardian : â€œRand is always going to have support among the liberty vote .
But we have a significant number of liberty voters , which makes his case for candidacy weaker and what we have been able to do â€ “ which he hasnâ€ ™ t
â€ “ is to compete in other lanes [ sections of party
support].â€ �
However , by skipping the vote on auditing the Fed , Cruz risks jeopardizing some of the credibility he has built in this faction of the Republican party .
Auditing the Federal Reserve has long been an animating cause of Paul and his supporters and it has taken on major symbolic significance .
One prominent libertarian Cruz supporter in Iowa , Joel Kurtinitis , went so far as to write on Facebook : â€œGod bless Ted Cruz ,
heâ€ ™ s a good man
and I am doing my best to make sure he wins the Iowa Caucuses and the nomination .
That said , I am deeply disappointed by his choice to miss the Audit the Fed vote .
I think it was a terrible decision , both principally and pragmatically.â€
�
The question is whether this missed vote will cause a deeper rift among the libertarian voters that Cruz is wooing .
The senator has consistently been in the top two in polling in both Iowa and nationally while Rand Paul has been lagging far behind .
However , it is clear , with Ron Paul off the sidelines , that the Rand Paul campaign will do all it can to win back the voters in Iowa who made up his fatherâ€ ™ s base in the Hawkeye State ."
2016-01-13,"The one person who can stand up to Donald Trump isnâ€ ™ t Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton â€ “ or even Ted Cruz .
Itâ€ ™ s President Barack Obama .
In his final State of the Union on Tuesday , Obama didnâ€ ™ t settle for running down a list of accomplishments or even outlining what policies heâ€ ™ d like to see enacted in the coming year .
Instead he set his sights on the future of America , by focusing in part on who might be elected in November .
But rather than coming out as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton or any other Democrat , Obama defined himself more abstractly as against fear .
Itâ€ ™ s a clever move , implicating both Donald Trump and to a lesser extent Ted Cruz , whoâ€ ™ ve in recent weeks capitalized on the politics of fear â€ “ both Americansâ€ ™ economic anxieties and xenophobia â€ “ to drive their campaign messages home .
Itâ€ ™ s the kind of insinuation that only a wordsmith could get away with , and so deft was his attack on the GOPâ€ ™ s frontrunners on Tuesday that he never even had to name them to invoke them .
Take the following : â€œWe live in a time of extraordinary change , â€ � Obama began ; itâ€ ™ s not the first time America has been through such changes , and each time , weâ€ ™ ve acted anew .
â€œWe did not , in the words of Lincoln , adhere to the â€˜dogmas of the quiet past , â€ ™ â€ � Obama added , â€œInstead we thought anew , and acted anew.â€ �
Though his rhetoric was lofty and seemingly above the fray , the jab at Trump was clear .
By encouraging Americans to be forward - looking and -thinking , he positioned himself as diametrically opposed to Trump , whose tagline â€ “ â€œMake America great
againâ€ �
â€ “ would have us all look backward for our solutions , to our â€œdogmas of the pastâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s all a matter of perspective , of course , and Obama wants the lines between him and Trump drawn clearly whether on national security , immigration or the economy .
â€œThe future we want â€ “ opportunity and security for our families ; a rising standard of living and a sustainable , peaceful planet for our kids â€ “ all that is within our reach , â€ � Obama continues .
â€œBut it will only happen if we work together .
It will only happen if we can have rational , constructive debates.â€ �
Here a call for rational debates isnâ€ ™ t just a dig at a gridlocked Congress , though it certainly is that ; itâ€ ™ s also a comment the Republican debates , one of which is on Thursday and which have previously devolved into schoolyard - style insult hurling .
This time , Obama suggests , he is hoping that weâ€ ™ ll see something a bit more constructive : â€œOur public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention , â€ � the president lamented .
( Again : he was talking about Trump . )
In other places , Obama was even less subtle in his jabs .
His reference to Trumpâ€ ™ s bigoted call to ban all Muslims from entering the country
was , at best , thinly veiled
: â€œWhen politicians insult Muslims , when a mosque is vandalized , or a kid bullied , that doesnâ€ ™ t make us safer.â€

That was uncannily similar to an argument put forth by Hillary Clinton in a recent debate , when she said Trumpâ€ ™ s anti - Muslim rhetoric was actively being used in recruitment videos byterrorists .
( Though that particular claim wasnâ€ ™ t immediately demonstrable , we now know that some terrorists are indeed doing precisely that . )
By not defining tolerance and acceptance of Muslims as a stance against Trump or for Hillary , Obama can take Clintonâ€ ™ s side but be principled , not partisan .
If he can successfully build support for an anti - Trump brand of politics , Obama will have accomplished what nobody on the Democratic or Republican side has been able to do : take down Trump .
Jeb Bush , upon embarking on that mission quickly became laughing stock ; Cruzâ€ ™ s strategy has relied on appeasement ; even Clinton , the supposed powerhouse in the race , backed off her Trump offensive when he attacked her husbandâ€ ™ s sexual history post schlong - gate .
However , Clinton wasnâ€ ™ t the only beneficiary of tonightâ€ ™ s debate : Bernie Sanders also had an advocate in Obama tonight , when he backed the senator up on everything from the link between climate change and national security to a discussion of the perils of American - driven regime change ( an issue on which Sanders has sparred with Clinton ) .
Obamaâ€ ™ s building up of Democratic candidates isnâ€ ™ t altruism : Hillary Clinton has been actively campaigning on upholding many aspects of Obamaâ€ ™ s legacy , including recently announcing her intent to see that his newest gun control measures remain the law of the land .
Before that , she promised to build upon the historic climate deal the president helped facilitate in Paris ; Sanders said heâ€ ™ d take that foundation but go much further .
A vote for another Democratic presidency is a vote to protect Obamaâ€ ™ s legacy , and he didnâ€ ™ t shy away from calling people to the polls .
â€œOur collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen , â€ �
he said , tellingly speaking more to Americans than the members of Congress assembled for the State of The Union .
Though Obama never once mentioned Clinton by name , his presence from afar could make the best campaign trail surrogate yet for Clinton .
On Tuesday , we may just have seen the beginnings of his stump speech ; title it : â€œAgainst fear.â€ �"
2016-01-14,"Thursdayâ€ ™ s Republican presidential debate in Charleston is shaping up as two different battles .
The first will be between the fieldâ€ ™ s two frontrunners , New York businessman Donald Trump and Texas senator Ted Cruz , to determine who will hold top dog status just three weeks before the Iowa caucus , the first electoral test of the 2016 election .
The second will be between the remaining five candidates on the main stage as they try to muscle their way into the spotlight .
Cruz had long clinched Trump tight in a boxerâ€ ™ s move that was half an embrace and half an attempt to keep the real estate mogul from throwing a clean punch , but he has abruptly changed tone in recent days .
After Trump repeatedly fanned the flames over whether Cruz was eligible to be president because of the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s birth in Canada , Cruz went on the offensive .
In a series of interviews Wednesday , the Texas senator accused Trump of having â€œNew York valuesâ€ � , suggested that Trump could not win a general election and echoed Jeb Bush in attacking Trump for being unprepared on foreign policy .
Trump has been careful , though , not to directly criticize Cruz .
Instead , he has simply phrased his doubts about the Texasâ€ ™ s senator Canadian birthplace as concern over potential Democratic litigation .
He tweeted on Wednesday : Cruz is showing less restraint .
â€œIt seems the Hillary folks are very eager to support Donald Trump and the attacks that are being tossed my direction , â€ � the Texas senator has said .
According to one Cruz adviser , the campaign sees Republican primaries as historically culminating in a matchup between a conservative candidate and an establishment candidate .
The adviser sees Cruz as the one dominant conservative candidate with only retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson competing in that â€œlaneâ€ � â€ “ political jargon for a section of the party â€ “ and the other five presidential hopefuls on the main stage â€ “ Trump , Florida senator Marco Rubio , New Jersey governor Chris Christie , former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Ohio governor John Kasich â€ “ fighting for the other spot .
While it may be counterintuitive to think of Trump as an â€œestablishment candidateâ€ � , the adviser pointed out that Trumpâ€ ™ s strength in polls is with moderate voters .
In conversations with Iowa Republicans , several see Trump as a potentially becoming the candidate of pro - business , relatively moderate Republicans in the state who want to beat Cruz .
Thursdayâ€ ™ s debate is shaping up as the first major contest between the two .
While Trump has done well in the many Republican debates that have taken place so far , he has faced relatively few direct attacks .
Cruz has arguably given the strongest and most consistent performances of any candidate so far in the debates and is likely to be well prepared for any Trump retorts .
The question is whether another candidate from the so - called establishment , a term which now includes a hard - right conservative such as Marco Rubio and a leader of the 1994 Republican Revolution such as John Kasich , can emerge to challenge Trump .
While Rubio is currently the strongest , polling in third place in Iowa and second place in New Hampshire , he has yet to break through in any one state and rivals have raised questions about his rather lackadaisical schedule on the campaign trail .
The Florida senator is currently caught in a political netherworld between Cruz and Trump and the rest of the field .
He is liked in national polls and various state polls , but still struggling to stand out , and is consistently mired at just over 10 % in every survey .
However , Rubio is competitive in all three early states , unlike his â€œestablishmentâ€ � competitors .
Those three candidates , Bush , Christie and Kasich , are all focused on New Hampshire and are all seeking a breakout moment in the campaign .
One well - connected New Hampshire operative noted that Kasich had one of the two strongest campaign operations in the state , along with Rand Paul .
However , in a crowded , competitive field , a strong such program might not be enough to stand out â€ “ and these candidates are all expected to target Rubio on Thursday night .
For Rubio , who was the focus of most of his rivalsâ€ ™ attacks in the last debate , Thursday will again put his resolve to the test .
In recent weeks , he has found himself engaged in a battle with Cruz over who is less â€œpro - amnestyâ€ � â€ “ an issue that stems from Rubioâ€
™ s work on a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 .
Allies of Bush have also seized on Rubioâ€ ™ s inconsistency on immigration in a bid to rile up resentment among conservatives who were rankled by the senatorâ€ ™ s efforts to pass a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants .
And with Christie emerging as a potential threat in New Hampshire , Rubio has been forced to fend off a series of attacks from the New Jersey governor questioning his preparedness to serve as president .
After first telling the Washington Post that Rubio canâ€ ™ t â€œslime his way to the White Houseâ€ � , Christie later framed a Rubio - Clinton matchup as one in which the former secretary of state would â€œpat [ Rubio ] on the head and rip his heart outâ€ � .
Rubio has responded by questioning Cruzâ€ ™ s own consistency on immigration and Christieâ€ ™ s more moderate past on guns and abortion â€ “ but he has been put on the defensive more often than not .
The main debate will be preceded by an undercard debate with three participants : former Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul was invited to participate in the lower debate but declined , insisting that his campaign was â€œtop tierâ€ � and worthy of being on the main stage ."
2016-01-15,"At the Republican debate in South Carolina on Thursday , Ted Cruz got the first question after the first break .
It was about his Canadian birth to an American mother .
Donald Trump has called you not â€œnatural - bornâ€ � as prescribed in the constitution , Cruz was asked .
Are you eligible ?
â€œIâ€ ™ m glad we are focusing on the important topics of the evening , â€ �
Cruz began .
â€œBack in September , my friend Donald said he had his lawyers look at this in every which way .
â€œSince September , the constitution hasnâ€ ™ t changed â€ “ but the poll numbers have .
And I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa .
But the facts and the record here are really quite clear.â€ �
Then Cruz said that both McCain , born in Panama , and George Romney , Mittâ€ ™ s father , born in Mexico , were eligible to run for president .
He continued : â€œThe birther theories that Donald is relying on say that you have to have two parents born on US soil .
I would be disqualified , Marco Rubio would be , Bobby Jindal would be disqualified .
And Donald Trump would be disqualified.â€ �
Trumpâ€ ™ s
mother was born in Scotland .
Cruz then added an old Reagan line : â€œOn the issue of citizenship , Donald , Iâ€ ™ m not going to use your motherâ€ ™ s birth against you.â€ �
Trump answered : â€œBecause it wouldnâ€ ™ t work.â€ �
He then bragged about his poll numbers , and was booed for doing so .
Then he warned that if Cruz beat the rest of the field : â€œI already know that the Democrats will sue.â€ � â€œIf you become the nominee , who the hell knows if you can even serve in office , â€ �
Trump added .
â€œAnd you should go out and get a declaratory judgment.â€ �
Why was Trump raising the question now ?
He pointed to the polls , saying of Cruz : â€œNow heâ€ ™ s doing a little bit better .
He never had a chance .
Now heâ€ ™ s doing a little bit better , heâ€ ™
s got probably a 4 - 5 % chance.â€
�
Trump turned to Cruz : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a big question mark on your head , and you canâ€ ™ t do that to the party .
The Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit .
And you have to have certainty.â€ �
The crowd was restive .
Hollers and boos broke out again .
Cruz turned them to cheers by saying that he had spent his life arguing the constitution .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to take legal advice from Donald Trump , â€ � he said ."
2016-01-15,"Endorsements from gun - rights advocacy organizations were brandished with gusto on the debate stage on Thursday , with Jeb Bush , Ted Cruz , Chris Christie , Marco Rubio and Donald Trump dueling over who would do more to protect the second amendment rights of Americans concerned about their access to firearms .
Cruz went furthest in playing to such fears , pointing out that the next president could have multiple supreme court appointments to make , which he said meant : â€œThe government could confiscate your guns.â€ � Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo ignited the battle when she asked Bush whether , in light of the revelation that the suspect in the fatal mass shooting that claimed nine lives in Charleston last year was able to procure a weapon despite not passing a federal background test , there was anything that could be done to limit access to deadly weapons by those who would use them to commit violent crimes .
Bush touted his A - plus rating from the National Rifle Association and said that the failure lay not with loopholes in the law , but with the federal government .
â€œThe FBI made a mistake , â€ � Bush said .
â€œThe law requires a background check.â€
�
The true area of the federal governmentâ€ ™
s focus , Bush said , should be with mental health , rather than restrictions on firearms .
When asked if he believed in enacting any restrictions on access to guns , Trump â€ “ who has previously described himself as â€œa big second amendment
personâ€
�
â€ “ responded that such restrictions may have led to the deaths of 130 people in terrorist attacks in Paris .
â€œEven in Paris , if they had guns on the other side , going in the opposite direction , you wouldnâ€ ™ t have 130-plus people dead.â€ �
With a variation on an old line , he added : â€œThe guns donâ€ ™ t pull the trigger , the people pull the trigger.â€ � Rubio , in a bid to top Trump , declared that any president who was willing to take guns away from American citizens wasnâ€ ™ t a president worth having .
â€œI am convinced that if this president could take away every gun in America , he would , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThe first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law - abiding citizens.â€ � Echoing Trumpâ€ ™ s insistence that gun restrictions contributed to the fatalities in the Paris terrorist attacks , Rubio said that restrictions would only aid those who would commit crimes while armed .
â€œIsis and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show , â€ �
he said .
â€œ[Obamaâ€ ™ s ] immediate answer , before he even knows the facts , is gun control .
Hereâ€ ™ s a fact : Weâ€ ™ re in a war with Isis.â€ �
Christie , in his take on the presidentâ€ ™
s
record on the second amendment , gave a variation on a line he has used before .
â€œThis
guyâ€ ™ s a petulant child , â€ �
Christie said .
He followed that up by saying that â€œweâ€ ™ re not against you â€ “ weâ€ ™ re against your policiesâ€ � and that â€œweâ€ ™ re going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fallâ€ � .
Cruz also questioned the fidelity of his rivals to the second amendment , saying that as a Republican candidate for president , â€œunless you are clinically insane , thatâ€ ™ s
what you say in the primaryâ€ � .
â€œBut peopleâ€ ™ s actions donâ€ ™ t always match their words , â€ � he added ."
2016-01-15,"The Ted Cruz and Donald Trump love story
â€
“ donâ€
™ t call it a â€œbromanceâ€ � , now that Carly Fiorinaâ€ ™
s used the word â€ “ is over .
It was a short - lived and incredibly well - documented political phenomenon that began last month when Trump conspicuously held his punches against Cruz in a debate , and Cruz happily returned the favor .
Conventional wisdom held that Cruz was positioning himself as Trumpâ€ ™ s best friend .
And indeed , if Trump had any intention of dropping out â€ “ or to put it in his terms , not - winning â€ “ their special relationship might well have blossomed .
But it was not to be .
The first sign that things had gotten rocky came last week , when Trump started loudly questioning Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility to serve as president , since Cruz was born in Canada .
Then , going into Thursdayâ€ ™ s debate , perhaps the biggest question on anyoneâ€
™ s mind was whether Cruz would finally revise his policy of Trump appeasement and take him on .
Well , the answer is in , and the two menâ€ ™ s love â€ “ forged of political convenience
â€ “ is officially deader than Ben Affleckâ€
™ s marriage .
Ultimately Cruzâ€ ™ s betrayal was born of his instinct for political self - preservation .
He went after Trump early â€ “ the moment that moderators brought up the question of his eligibility â€ “ and he did it much more skillfully and with considerably greater success than anyone else has managed to date .
Asked about whether his Canadian birth disqualified him for president , the Harvard - trained lawyer drove home his legal expertise even as he questioned Trumpâ€ ™ s motives : back in September , Cruz noted , Trump had his lawyers look at the birther question every which way
and nothing came of it .
â€œSince September , the constitution hasnâ€ ™ t changed , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œBut the poll numbers have.â€
�
Later in the two - and - a - half - hour debate , the dissolution of their accord got even uglier when Cruz , asked to address the meaning of his previous comment that Trump has â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � , didnâ€ ™ t back off or even hedge .
Cruz instead went for Trumpâ€ ™ s throat â€ “ the soft vulnerable spot that is Trumpâ€ ™ s association with patently liberal , elite New York .
â€œThe concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out , â€ � Cruz said , adding to applause from the audience in South Carolina : â€œNot a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan , Iâ€
™ m just saying.â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s response was cool - headed , exactly the sort of polished Princeton debate performance he was expected to deliver .
And Trumpâ€ ™ s counter
â€ “ that conservative William F Buckley came from New York â€
“ wasnâ€ ™ t the strongest .
Though he lacks the formal debating prowess of Cruz , Trumpâ€ ™ s secondary attack was more adept .
Instead of preying upon Americanâ€ ™ s economic anxieties or their irrational fear of Muslims and Mexicans , Trump invoked the spirit of New Yorkers after 9/11 .
â€œThe people in New York fought and fought and fought , â€ � he said , recalling how the world â€œloved New York and loved New Yorkersâ€ � .
It was a tactic that Cruz , for all his own calculated lines of attack , didnâ€ ™ t seem to have anticipated , and he backed off .
And yet , despite the fact that it was quite possibly the weakest - looking Trumpâ€ ™ s ever come out of a debate tussle with another candidate thus far , he didnâ€ ™ t miss but a beat before pivoting to patriotism and the place where he does excel like no other : pulling heart - strings and reminding Americans of the things they fear .
If Cruz ended the contretemps technically ahead in the abstract realm of argumentation , he was decidedly less so in the realm of the human and intuition .
Speaking from the heart doesnâ€ ™ t appear to come naturally to Cruz the way it does to Trump , even if it makes Cruz less susceptible to gaffes played off as bombast .
Still , it was the kind of night that Cruz has reportedly been working toward , changing his debate style to be less lofty and more overtly aggressive .
And there he succeeded .
He may not have landed a definitive victory but he did something else : he answered the question of whether anything could ever stop Trump or even effectively counter his insults .
And while Trumpâ€ ™ s performance was certainly strong , but we may just have seen the first chink in his armor â€ “ thanks to Cruz , and the end of their super sad love story ."
2016-01-15,"The race for the Republican presidential nomination erupted into open conflict between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz on Thursday night , with the partyâ€ ™ s two frontrunners launching blistering attacks over their values and eligibility for the nationâ€ ™ s highest office .
With just 18 days to go before the starting gun of the 2016 presidential election is fired at the Iowa caucuses , tensions that have been simmering beneath the surface exploded into plain sight .
And the rhetoric got hotter as candidates vied with one another to sound toughest on guns , fear of Muslims , immigration and American foreign policy .
Liberal â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � were deplored by Cruz , while Florida senator Marco Rubio vowed to start sending more terrorist suspects to GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
However , a debate which lasted more than two and a half hours was dominated by Trump , the billionaire real - estate tycoon , and Cruz , the senator for Texas .
After tiptoeing around each other for months as they compete for the ultra - conservative vote , they finally let their mutual disdain emerge at the sixth Republican debate in South Carolina .
As Trump and Cruz went after each other with new abandon , the North Charleston debate had the effect of appearing to further tighten the Republican contest .
At the start of the debate , the number on stage had already been whittled down to seven â€ “ the fewest yet following the relegation for lackluster poll ratings of Rand Paul , the libertarian senator for Kentucky , and former technology executive Carly Fiorina .
By the end of the debate , the pool of serious contenders appeared to have been reduced to just four â€ “ the battling frontrunners Trump and Cruz , Rubio and Chris Christie , the governor of New Jersey .
The remaining three â€ “ former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Ohio governor John Kasich and the once ascendant former neurosurgeon Ben Carson , spent much of the debate looking on from the sidelines .
The unofficial truce between Trump and Cruz , who are running essentially neck - and - neck in Iowa according to the latest local polls , was torn apart by the billowing spat over whether or not Cruz is a â€œnatural - born citizenâ€ � and thus eligible to run for the presidency .
Trump has been baiting Cruz in recent days , suggesting that doubts about the senatorâ€ ™ s eligibility because he was born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father could present the Democrats with a legal and electoral gift .
Under the television lights at the North Charleston Coliseum , where Trump yet again took pride of place in center stage and Cruz stood right beside him in recognition of his second - place ranking , the senator accused the billionaire of peddling â€œextremeâ€ �
â€œbirther
issuesâ€ � that only four months ago Trump himself had dismissed as immaterial .
â€œSince September the constitution hasnâ€ ™ t changed , but the poll numbers have , and I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa , â€ � Cruz said .
Cruz went on that under the most extreme birther theories , which suggest both parents of a president have to be born in America , â€œinterestingly enough Donald J Trump would be disqualified because Donaldâ€ ™ s mother was born in Scotlandâ€ � .
â€œBut I was born here .
Big difference , â€ �
Trump shot back .
Asked why he had raised the citizenship issue at this point in the race , Trump replied : â€œBecause now [ Cruz ] is doing a little better .
I didnâ€ ™ t care before
, he never had a chance .
Now he has a 4 - 5 % chance.â€ �
Later in the debate , Trump and Cruz went at each otherâ€ ™ s jugulars a second time â€ “ on this occasion over Cruzâ€ ™ s recent jibe that Trump subscribed to â€œNew York
valuesâ€
� .
â€œI think most people know what New York values are â€ ¦
Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan , â€ � Cruz said .
Trump , looking theatrically irate , hit back with a long diatribe about how New York City had responded to the 9/11 attacks .
â€œThe people of New York fought and fought and fought .
We saw more death , even the smell of death , it was with us for months .
Everyone in the world watched and everyone in the world loved New York .
I have to tell you , that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.â€ � The unrestrained fighting between the two frontrunners sucked much of the oxygen out of the debate , causing frustration among the others .
At one point , Rubio blurted out : â€œI hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.â€
�
Rick Tyler , Cruzâ€ ™ s national spokesman shied away from describing Cruz as attacking Trump .
Instead , he thought the campaign had entered the contrast stage .
â€œThey presented different points of view on different issues , â€ � he said of the spat between the candidates .
â€œThatâ€
™ s a contrast
, I donâ€ ™ t consider those attacks , if thereâ€ ™ s a difference on policy weâ€ ™ ll point out difference on policy .
When we get attacked on silly things like birther conspiracies , weâ€ ™ ll respond.â€
�
The clash at the top of the Republican pile was echoed in harsh exchanges between two more contenders who are struggling with one another â€ “ Rubio and Christie .
The Florida senator and New Jersey governor are banking on a strong finish in New Hampshire , which Christie has made a focus of his campaign , in the hope of being crowned the â€œanyone - but - Trumpâ€ � alternative to the tycoon .
Rubio turned on Christie , attacking him for what he characterized as a liberal record in New Jersey .
â€œI like Chris Christie , â€ � said Rubio , â€œbut we canâ€ ™ t afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.â€ �
The Florida senator then went on to attack Christie for donating to Planned Parenthood and for supporting the supreme court nomination of liberal judge Sonia Sotomayor .
Christie insisted that â€œsomeone has been whispering in olâ€ ™ Marcoâ€ ™ s earâ€ � to encourage him to make such untrue negative talks .
â€œI
didnâ€ ™
t support Sonia Sotomayor .
I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.â€
�
Both of Christieâ€ ™ s statements are untrue .
Christie said in 2009 of Sotomayor , â€œI am confident that she is qualified for the position of Associate Justice of the US supreme court.â€ �
Christie also said in 1994 ,
â€œI support Planned Parenthood privately with
my personal contributionâ€ �
and said gun control was the issue that â€œenergized himâ€ � to enter politics .
The New Jersey governor , though , went on to mourn the fact that Rubio attacked him .
â€œTwo years ago , he called me the conservative reformer that New Jersey needed , â€ � said Christie â€œIâ€ ™ ve never changed my tune .
Marco Rubio is a good guy and a smart guy.â€
�
The rising temperature of the nomination race as Iowa fast approaches prompted a tone of debate that was sharper , more shrill than in the previous five televised engagements .
In particular , the candidates tried to outdo each other in attacking Obama and the Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in ever more lurid terms .
Christie took the prize , calling Obama a â€œpetulant childâ€ � and vowing that the Republicans would â€œkick your rear end out of the White House from this fallâ€ � .
Rubio also took a notably more aggressive posture than he had in previous debates
â€ “ dropping a more cerebral approach for caustic comments on Obama , Clinton and in regard to national security .
He vowed if he were elected president to wage war against â€œradical jihadist terroristsâ€ � , saying â€œif we capture any of them alive they are getting a one - way ticket to GuantÃ¡namoâ€ � .
Yet again , Bush tried to take a shot at Trump after the frontrunner defended his call for an temporary ban on all Muslims entering the US .
Bush argued that â€œthis policy is a policy that makes it impossibleâ€ � to fight Isis and noted â€œthe Kurds are our strongest allies , they are Muslimsâ€ � .
In the former Florida governorâ€ ™ s view , Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œrash statementsâ€
�
sent â€œsignals of weaknessâ€ � to the rest of the world .
Kasich sounded a more conciliatory tone on the issue of police shootings .
The governor of a state that saw Black Lives Matter protests in the aftermath of the shooting death of Tamir Rice , said â€œprotest is fine but violence is wrongâ€ � and insisted â€œthe country needs to be healedâ€ � .
A further brutal exchange broke out late into the debate between Cruz and Rubio , whose similarities â€ “ both sons of Cuban fathers , both senators â€ “ can not disguise their mutual hostility .
Rubio hit Cruz on surveillance and his support of the USA Freedom Act by alleging the Texas senator acted in concert with Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders and libertarian Republican Rand Paul on the floor of the Senate .
In contrast , Rubio maintained his national security bona fides insisting : â€œEdward Snowden is a traitor and if I am president and we get our hands on him , he is standing trial for treason.â€ � South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy , a prominent Rubio supporter , thought the attack on Cruz was fair game for the Florida senator .
â€œI think contrast is good if itâ€ ™ s done in context and itâ€ ™ s fair , â€ � said Gowdy .
â€œIf you present yourself as being pure without any deviations , it is fair to have episodes of , shall we say non - compliance , pointed out to peopleâ€ � in what was a barely disguised slam at Cruz .
Carson , briefly a frontrunner , seemed flummoxed throughout the debate , and was a non - factor .
The retired neurosurgeonâ€ ™ s campaign has been beset by high staff turnover and accusations of financial irregularities .
Much of the money the campaign has raised has gone to direct mail vendors .
After the debate , when asked by the Guardian if his campaign was a direct mail scam , Carson said : â€œNot that I know of.â€ �
In the undercard debate earlier on Thursday evening , Fiorina , former senator Rick Santorum from Pennsylvania , and the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee also targeted their fire primarily on Clinton .
In one of the more memorable lines from the hour - long discussion , Fiorina said : â€œUnlike another woman in this race , I actually love spending time with my husband.â€ � Paul had decided to boycott the early debate in protest at being ejected from the main primetime event .
But he was represented in that main debate , after all , when a group of hecklers briefly interrupted proceedings with shouts of : â€œWe want Rand !
We want Rand!â€
�
At the end of the debate , Clinton made clear her view of the event in a tweet : â€œ2 1/2 hours of this ?
Imagine 4 years.â€ �"
2016-01-15,"Toward the end of last nightâ€ ™ s 523rd Republican presidential debate , Senator Ted Cruz , whom you might remember as the demonic spirit from the movie It Follows , suddenly turned into the Moviefone guy and reminded America that a very , very important motion picture is set for release on Friday .
â€œTomorrow morning a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi , â€ � he said .
â€œAnd the politicians that abandoned them.â€ �
He was referring to 13 Hours :
The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi , which you might know better as â€œThe Benghazi Movieâ€ � .
I honestly havenâ€
™ t heard many people actually refer to the film by its official title .
Ask someone on the street if theyâ€ ™ ve seen 13 Hours and they might respond with : â€œOh , you mean the Spike Lee movie?â€ � No , thatâ€ ™ s
the 25th Hour .
â€œIs
that the movie about the Cuban missile crisis?â€ � Negative , thatâ€ ™ s Thirteen Days .
So , I just call it The Benghazi Movie .
Sorta like The Lego Movie , but replacing Batman , Lord Business and Wyldstyle with a series of sitcom actors wearing identical beards and some sheep .
Senator Cruz is still pretty hung up on the events of 11 September 2012 , an assault on American diplomatic and espionage bases in Libya .
To be fair , so was everyone else on the stage last night .
Chris Christie promised that Hillary Clinton , secretary of state during the Benghazi attack , would â€œnot get within 10 miles of the White Houseâ€ � because of her perceived crimes were he to become president .
That seems kind of harsh .
After all , she used to live there .
What if she left her sunglasses in the Lincoln bedroom ?
But that pointed rhetoric is indicative of the conservative view of Clinton and the tragedy in Benghazi .
They want someone punished , preferably Hillary , since sheâ€ ™ s actively running for the highest office in the land .
Four Americans died , plus those who lost their lives on the other side of the conflict .
The people who survived the siege of the American outposts had their very existence changed irrevocably .
No one should have to experience such a horror show .
Except you can right now , for a price .
It only cost me $ 14 , plus the cost of two Uber rides , to experience said horror show â€ “ well , at least Michael Bayâ€ ™ s multimillion - dollar fictionalized , shaky - cam approximation of a horror show .
After Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s call to arms , I knew that it was my duty as an American to swallow a bucket of popcorn like a baby bird while watching the truth about Benghaziâ€ ™ s heroes on the largest screen available .
I needed to join my fellow patriots and do my duty .
Plus , I had no other plans and no one was answering my phone calls .
I was seeing the film at the Americana at Brand , an outdoor mall - slash - consumerist pleasure palace that resembles a quaint , small - town American main street .
Thereâ€ ™ s a trolley that ferries shoppers from one end of the mall to the other , which takes much longer than just walking .
I suppose itâ€ ™ s great for tourists who want to take pictures .
â€œLook , honey ,
â€ � they might say .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s the Apple store !
And a Cheesecake Factory !
And a Sephora !
Wow , this really is the greatest country in the world.â€ �
In that moment , as I take in the capitalist splendor , I feel grateful that I was seeing 13 Hours at the Americana .
It reminds me what our boys in Libya were fighting for .
The mall has a theater â€ “ a generic monstrosity called the Pacific Theaters 18 â€ “ in the middle of the complex .
I walk in a half - hour before the 9.05pm screening is set to begin .
The clerk at the front of the house asks me to pick my seat
â€
“ LA is civilized , so most multiplexes have assigned seating now .
I have a litany of options , as the theater is maybe 30 % full , if Iâ€ ™ m being generous .
I deliberately choose a seat close to the screen , because if Iâ€ ™ m going to get the truth about Benghazi , I want the whole truth .
As I enter the auditorium , I scan the crowd for the purposes of assessing the demographics .
Thereâ€ ™ s only one woman I can see , and sheâ€ ™ s on a date .
I wonder what kind of sadistic creature considered 13 Hours an acceptable date movie .
Itâ€ ™ s not quite Love , Actually , people .
Itâ€ ™ s more like Death
, Eventually â€ “ a grisly , jingoistic tale of noble beards fighting for survival .
I suppose thatâ€ ™ s kind of romantic .
John Krasinskiâ€ ™ s character has a wife and children ( with another one on the way ) that motivate him to survive certain peril at the hands of cruel , nihilistic terrorists .
Maybe Ted Cruz will take his wife to see this on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day and declare that he would also gladly eviscerate another human being to see her face again .
Hold me , Iâ€ ™ m swooning .
All thoughts of romance leave me once the lights dim and the ominous music kicks in .
This film is very dumb , very bleak and very graphic .
I laugh when the squirrelly guy from Breaking Bad screams : â€œI donâ€ ™ t want to hear it , Tyrone , â€
� as though heâ€ ™ s the surly chief from a bad 80s cop movie .
Toward the middle of the picture , Toby Stephens â€ “ the English actor best known as the villain from James Bond movie Die Another Day â€ “ turns to camera with a straight face and requests â€œa bag full of money and a flight to Benghaziâ€ � , which is the kind of thing that only sounds clever and significant in hindsight .
I guarantee you , no one knew that the word â€œBenghaziâ€ � would matter one bit to Americans back home almost four years later .
Still , Stephens delivers the line as though heâ€ ™ s talking to an audience in 2016 rather than the character
heâ€ ™ s sharing the scene with in the imaginary version of 2012 .
After a bit of banter and some exposition , the violence begins .
One of the lead beards gets his arm shot in half and spends a good portion of the third act with his forearm and hand dangling from the rest of his body like a sausage hanging in a deli window .
Bay is sure to frame the broken arm for maximum viewing disruption .
Itâ€ ™ s
so hideous â€ “
what with the dripping blood and exposed bones and what not â€ “ that you canâ€ ™ t help but pay rapt attention , albeit through the spaces between your fingers as you shield your face from the simulated mutilation .
I canâ€ ™ t help but wonder if the couple who came to see this film are regretting their decision as much as I am .
Dawn breaks and the cavalry arrives to save our heroes , and the film wraps up with our remaining beards escaping the hellish war zone and returning to their families .
Nicky Sobotka from The Wire asks John Krasinski what they get for their trouble .
Krasinski says : â€œWe get to go home.â€ �
In that moment , I felt like he was speaking for me .
Granted , I just watched the movie .
I didnâ€ ™ t even act in it .
I certainly didnâ€ ™ t live it .
All the same , I took great comfort in knowing I was about to go home too .
Just like John Krasinski , I was about to see my long - suffering , lonely wife .
I just hoped she wasnâ€ ™ t also pregnant .
The brave souls who ventured to the outdoor mall in order to watch a fake version of a real war exit the theater peacefully .
Hardly anyone speaks to each other , presumably because of the sheer gravity of the art theyâ€ ™ ve witnessed , or maybe just because theyâ€ ™ re really , really exhausted at midnight on a Thursday .
The lone couple makes some small talk , none of it about the movie , from what I can tell .
Two men walk out in front of me .
Theyâ€ ™ re also whispering , but I can definitely make out one of them saying the word â€œcrapâ€ � .
I donâ€
™ t know if thatâ€ ™ s in reference to 13 Hours , the current state of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team , or just life in general .
Some mysteries should never be solved .
My Uber driver on the ride home is named Lavrent .
He speaks with an accent , but I donâ€ ™ t dare speculate on its origin for fear of mislabeling him .
â€œPretty cold out , â€ �
Lavrent says in an attempt to make small talk .
â€œYup , though it could be worse .
It could be snowing , â€ �
I respond .
He goes on to tell me how he once witnessed 20 minutes of snow in Burbank , a town not far from Glendale .
His obligatory anecdote complete , we sit in silence for a bit until I venture to ask him how his night is going so far .
â€œI just started , â€ � he tells me .
My question is nothing more than a clever way to ask him what he thinks about 13 Hours .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s cool .
I just saw the Benghazi movie ,
â€ �
I say .
From there he shuts down , like I just pressed a button on Data from Star Trekâ€
™ s neck and deactivated him .
â€œYeah , it was really bad .
I donâ€
™ t know why I bothered seeing it ,
â€ �
I continue , hoping heâ€ ™ ll have an opinion or really any response at all .
Nothing .
I realize then that I either offended him or made him think I was about to commit a hate crime .
We get to my apartment , I thank him , he mumbles , and I leave .
I rate him five stars to apologize for our awkward moment â€ “ a minor penance for my social faux pas .
Itâ€ ™ s clear to me that collectively , and individually , we donâ€ ™ t want to talk about Benghazi .
Granted , neither did Hillary Clinton , but she did , for hours , more than once , with cameras trained on her the entire time .
Hillary probably doesnâ€ ™ t want to talk about it because itâ€ ™ s a roadblock in front of her path to the presidency .
The average citizen might not want to talk about it because itâ€ ™ s a divisive , politically charged topic with a tinge of xenophobia on the side .
Conservatives badly want to talk about it , though , because itâ€ ™ s politically advantageous for them in a presidential election year .
In all cases , our response to Benghazi is self - interested , predicated on our political leanings and our tolerance for tragedy .
Right or wrong , I donâ€
™ t think most Americans understand or care about Benghazi .
The rest have moved on .
A Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll from November of last year found that only 38 % of Americans found Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s response to the Benghazi attack unsatisfactory .
That it is still a throbbing , raw nerve in the gladitorial pit of our democracy is surprising .
That itâ€ ™ s now a form of escapist entertainment is depressing .
Iâ€ ™ m sure
the intention of Michael Bay and the other film - makers behind 13 Hours was to honor the fallen of Benghazi , but at least with the audience I saw the film with , the end result is a mind - numbing sensory assault thatâ€ ™ s barely coherent .
Itâ€ ™ s a movie
thatâ€ ™ s no more political than a Transformers sequel , probably because Michael Bay is less interested in politics than he is in social hierarchies and class warfare .
Like in any Michael Bay movie , bureaucrats , intellectuals and upper - class snobs are benign , arrogant foils for the true heroes
â€ “ the muscle - bound oaf or the horny teen .
If thatâ€ ™ s a political statement , then I guess Caddyshack belongs in the same Netflix category as Bowling for Columbine .
Regardless , Ted Cruz and his fellow candidates will surely try to use this motion picture for their own personal gain for as long as possible .
Thatâ€ ™ s what we do with tragedy in this country , after all .
We build a memorial , complete with a gift shop stocked with all the cheaply made junk imaginable .
We crank out corny movies based on the true story in the hope that enough people will drag their significant other to the theater to experience the sadness first - hand , with the explicit goal of making a sorry buck off the misery .
And we try to score political points whenever possible .
Thatâ€ ™ s the American Way ."
2016-01-16,"When I found out that Ted Cruz has his own birthers â€ “ that the eligibility of the Canadian - born candidate to become President of the United States is being contested in a â€œpoorly written , 28-page complaintâ€ �
â€ “ my first thought was , â€œItâ€
™ s nice when two people find each other.â€
�
I thought that 28 pages of rambling would , should contain some kind of right - wing treasure ( like , at least one mention each of â€œchemtrailsâ€ � and â€œpurity of essenceâ€ � ) but , alas , Newton B Schwartz Sr , the 85-year - old Houston - based attorney who filed the suit against Cruz , appears to be a Democrat still grinding his teeth about the Obama birther non - conspiracy .
And , in any case , heâ€ ™ s wrong about Cruz .
So the only thing left to do is have fun with this anyway .
Weâ€ ™ ve all earned it .
Itâ€ ™ s easy to forget just how plain nutty and self - contradictory the original birther thing was .
Building on the decades - long conceit that any Democratic defeat of a Republican presidential candidate must represent a fundamental thwarting of the will of the American people , it naturally followed that Barack Obama was not actually president at all .
The only logical solution , then , to the conundrum of his election , was that Obama , a man born in Hawaii to an American mother , just wasnâ€ ™ t American , period , and thus ineligible to serve as president .
And while that theory allowed conservatives to engage in a lot of racialized â€œotheringâ€ � of Barack Obama , a lot of it was just funny , because after agreeing that Obama wasnâ€ ™ t American , no one reading from The Manchurian Candidate
For Toddlers could quite agree on how , precisely , the circumstances of his birth made him ineligible .
Supposedly , the president was really born in Kenya , so that automatically disqualified him .
Although , just to be on the safe side , he supposedly also needed to have two naturalized parents to be considered American enough , which meant that just having a Kenyan father disqualified him .
Someone even produced a fake birth certificate from 1961 , showing Obama born in the Republic of Kenya three years before it was born .
Then , of course , the birthers claimed that his American short - form birth certificate was fake , so we needed to see the long - form one ... which we eventually did , and the birthers declared that it , too , must have been faked .
Maricopa County , Arizonaâ€ ™ s fascist sheriff dispatched a fact - finding mission to Hawaii and came up with a press release .
And then there appeared a series of Photoshopped birth certificates in which Barack Obama was allegedly originally named â€œBarry Soeteroâ€ � , discovered by some of the same people who were convinced that Obama was born in Kenya , which made perfect sense , since a kid born in Kenya in 1961 would definitely have the last name of the Indonesian stepfather his mom didnâ€
™ t meet until years later in Hawaii .
The eventual figurehead for all the birther nonsense was attorney Orly Taitz , who seemed like someone who tried to file suit at a dry cleaners and overall came off like a severely dehydrated Lady Gaga tanking an audition to play Natasha Fatale in between huffing a mixture of helium and nitrous oxide .
( America in 2009 was not the best place , but at least it had this show going for it . )
Interestingly enough ( as MSNBCâ€ ™ s Chris Hayes noted on Friday )
it seems as if , in retrospect , the birther movement was following a goofy script designed to set someone like Ted Cruz up for failure in a quest for the presidency .
In addition to Cruz actually being born outside of the United States â€ “ in the Canadian city of Calgary â€ “
all those imagined ( and some perhaps less so ) constitutional eligibility standards about a parent who was not a citizen or another parent who might have in some way renounced or suspended her citizenship actually describe Cruzâ€ ™ s family history far more than they ever did the Hawaiian - born Obamaâ€ ™ s .
And most of Congress already hates Ted Cruz for his grandstanding , camera - hogging , obstreperous non - collegial ways , which is why so many Republican Party members seem to be having fun with his predicament .
Rand Paul suggested that Ted Cruz was absolutely qualified to become Prime Minister of Canada .
Mike Huckabee is compelled and convinced !
Arizona Senator John McCain , who had to fend off his own birther questions by pointing out that he was born on a US military base in Panama , has despised Cruz since the manâ€ ™ s early days in the Senate , when Cruz implied that McCain buddy Chuck Hagel might have accepted money from North Korea .
McCain was probably rolling the words around his mouth like they were stolen sweets when he told a radio host that he â€œdidnâ€ ™ t know the answerâ€ � as to whether Cruz was eligible to be president .
Meanwhile , Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , who probably wishes Ted Cruz would go try to make toaster strudel in a full bathtub , initially refused to comment definitively on his eligibility , stating , â€œIâ€ ™ ll let all these folks argue about this stuff , and Iâ€ ™ m going to stay out of it.â€ �
Now , thereâ€ ™ s a school of thought that people shouldnâ€ ™ t be enjoying this newest strain of birtherism ; that , after deploring the conduct of conservatives asserting Obamaâ€ ™ s illegitimacy , teasing and tweaking the Cruz birther phenomenon only retroactively legitimizes what was clearly a broadly racist movement to undo the Obama presidency without having to count actual votes .
But that generous impulse conflates two distinct issues .
Obama birtherism was the result of a lot of people who refused to recognize a lawfully elected public official because of what he looked like or the theory of government he espoused .
It was a malignant extension of a frame of thought that says certain people are not allowed power over â€œAmericansâ€ � .
Cruz birtherism is just trolling an unbearable prick .
Itâ€ ™ s doubtful that any non - crazy people truly believe that Ted Cruz is disqualified to become president .
Even the person pushing that narrative now the most ( and who once himself rode the tide of Obama birther sentiment ) , Donald Trump , likely doesnâ€ ™ t believe a word of it .
Trump , after all , is an opportunist who will believe whatever closes the deal .
Cruz birtherism is a fake issue that couldnâ€ ™ t find a better target : a Princeton and Harvard educated white - shoe litigator married to a Goldman Sachs executive who likes to fire weapons covered in bacon and LARP as a good olâ€ ™ boy with that Duck Dynasty yahoo , who clerked for the US supreme court but acts as if the NRAâ€ ™ s faux - academic flunkies are the last word on Second Amendment jurisprudence , who paraphrases Molon Labe in fundraising emails and pretends that the president will confiscate all our guns and who studied American history and yet claims with a straight face that Barack Obama is the most left - wing president in history .
The Ted Cruz birther conspiracy is a fatuous gimmick , but , come on , so is the candidate .
Itâ€ ™ s nice when these people find each other ."
2016-01-16,"On a chilly January weekend , as Marco Rubio kicked off the most important year of his political career , two voters offered competing advice on how he should address immigration â€ “ an issue that has roiled the race for the Republican presidential nomination .
Under attack over a comprehensive immigration reform bill he helped craft in 2013 , which drew widespread conservative ire over its inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , the Florida senator found himself on defense .
Negative advertisements , sponsored predominantly by allies of Ted Cruz , the Texas senator and immigration hardliner , painted Rubio as a proponent of so - called â€œamnestyâ€ � .
As Rubio addressed a packed crowd in Hampton , one woman asked : why not take a page from Barack Obama and deliver a speech on a â€œmore perfect unionâ€ � ?
It was a reference to the 2008 address in which the future president responded to controversial remarks by his former pastor with a sweeping address on race , religion and politics .
As the son of Cuban immigrants , the voter said , Rubio was uniquely positioned to reset the narrative .
Less than 24 hours later , less than an hour away , Rubio encountered the opposite view .
A second woman said she had discussed Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy with others and was troubled to learn he was â€œsoftâ€ � on immigration .
He would need to assure her that was not the case .
The immigration question has been an evolving one for Rubio , who if elected president would be the first Latino to occupy the White House .
But in Thursday nightâ€ ™ s presidential debate in North Charleston , South Carolina , the senator set before millions of viewers the approach he plans to take in the home stretch of the Republican primary .
Asked about his immigration bill and its proposed expansion of green cards for foreign workers , Rubio sidestepped , seeking to recast the topic as a matter of national security .
The issue , he said , was now â€œdramatically differentâ€ � than two years ago , due to the emergence of â€œa group of radical crazies named Isisâ€ � .
â€œOur
No 1 priority must now become ensuring that Isis can not get killers into the United States , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œSo whether itâ€ ™ s green cards or any other form of entry into America , when Iâ€ ™ m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming , you are not going to get into the United States of America.â€
�
The following morning , his campaign launched two new TV ads .
In one â€ “ a direct response to an ad by a pro - Jeb Bush Super Pac that accused Rubio of flip - flopping on immigration â€ “ Rubio vowed to undo Obamaâ€ ™ s executive orders , cut funding for so - called â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ � , finish 700 miles of border wall , add 20,000 border agents and deport â€œcriminal aliensâ€ � .
â€œWhen Iâ€ ™ m president , there will be no amnesty , â€ � Rubio said .
The urgency with which Rubio now presents a tougher demeanor stands in stark contrast to the greater part of last year .
After launching his candidacy in April at Miamiâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower , the first stop for Cuban exiles fleeing Fidel Castroâ€ ™ s regime from 1962 to 1974 , Rubio largely spoke of immigration through the story of his parents .
Only in America , he said , could immigrants who worked as a bartender and a maid leave their son in a position to run for president .
But unless asked by a voter or a reporter , Rubio seldom brought up immigration reform .
He did , nonetheless , lay out a three - step plan that would secure the border , modernize legal immigration and promote visas for high - skilled workers , and finally determine how to bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows .
He almost never uttered the word â€œamnestyâ€ � and , when pressed , acknowledged being â€œpersonallyâ€ � open to green cards for law - abiding undocumented immigrants .
It was not until late December , as he and Cruz escalated their feud , that Rubio began to raise the subject of immigration in his stump speech â€ “ but only to emphasize that as president , he would â€œenforce the lawâ€ � .
In recent weeks , he has made the case that immigration is inextricably linked to terrorism .
There may be no other option in a primary where a majority of Republicans are rankled by national security concerns and more skeptical of immigrants than in any recent election .
Polling in recent months found that a significant faction of voters favor the extreme line drawn by frontrunner Donald Trump , including his proposed ban on Muslim immigration .
That the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants living in the US are now being conflated with the Syrian refugee crisis is a byproduct of Trumpâ€ ™ s dominance .
Trumpâ€ ™ s first TV ad invoked the mass shooting in San Bernardino , California , touted his proposed moratorium on Muslim migrants and alluded to terrorists streaming across the southern border .
Although he has rejected a religious test for entry into the US , Rubioâ€ ™ s stance on refugees has changed .
He was among the first candidates to say the US should allow them in , a stance he reversed after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November .
He then suggested he was open to the admission of â€œcommonsenseâ€ � individuals that could be vetted , such as elderly women , children and Chaldean priests .
On the stump , Rubio compares the refugee question to locking oneâ€ ™ s door .
There was a time when people did not do so , he says , before observing that the world has changed .
â€œWhen you lock your doors , itâ€ ™ s not because you hate the people outside of your home , â€ � he often says .
â€œYou lock your doors because you love the people inside.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s opponents have pointed out that terrorist groups hardly cropped up overnight .
Immediately after Thursdayâ€ ™ s debate , his critics resurrected a clip from 2013 following the Boston Marathon bombing â€ “ an event that coincided with negotiations over Rubioâ€ ™ s immigration bill .
Then , Rubio urged skeptics to â€œkeep in perspectiveâ€ � that the bombers were just two migrants and any lessons learned could be worked into his legislation .
Today , he insists national security has prompted him to rethink immigration entirely .
What that means for his appeal to Latino voters remains to be seen .
For now , he must fend off attacks from his right , as from Cruz and Trump , and from those who agree with him on broader policy issues .
On Friday , Bush , who once praised Rubioâ€ ™ s work on immigration , knocked the senator over what he deemed to be a lack of leadership .
â€œMarco cut and run , plain and simple , for whatever reason , â€ � Bush told reporters in South Carolina .
The former Florida governor had just earned the endorsement of Senator Lindsey Graham , a coauthor of Rubioâ€ ™ s immigration bill in 2013 who dropped out of the race last month .
On the campaign trail , Rubio portrays his twists and turns as a matter of pragmatism .
He has also taken to reminding voters that he knows the issue .
â€œMy entire family is immigrants , â€ �
Rubio told the New Hampshire voter who suggested he had a â€œsoftâ€ � reputation , also citing his West Miami community .
â€œI understand the good , the bad , and the ugly , and every aspect of it .
I know the story of people who are here illegally , and it would break your heart .
And I know the story of people that are here legally , whose stories would boil your blood .
â€œNo one who has ever run for president understands this issue personally better than I do and thatâ€ ™ s why I can tell you and you should tell your friends that no one running for president is better prepared to fix it than me.â€

It brought his loudest applause of the morning ."
2016-01-17,"In two of Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s signature legal briefs before the supreme court , he cited the liberal law professor whom Donald Trump has invoked in questioning Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility to be president .
As Texas solicitor general , Cruz cited Harvard professor Laurence Tribe as â€œa prominent commentatorâ€ � in his brief for Medellin v Texas , a case the senator invariably mentions on the stump .
In Thursday nightâ€ ™ s Republican debate , under fire from Trump , Cruz changed his tune about Tribe , who taught him constitutional law at Harvard , calling him â€œa leftwing judicial activist , [ a ] Harvard law professor who was Al Goreâ€ ™ s lawyer in Bush v Gore â€ ¦ a major Hillary Clinton supporterâ€ � .
The Medellin v Texas brief is posted to Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign website and the case features in a campaign ad , as it did when Cruz sought election to the US Senate in 2012 .
In that case , Cruz successfully argued that Texas should be allowed to execute a Mexican national convicted of rape and murder who had not been advised of his rights to contact his countryâ€ ™ s consulate under international law .
Cruz also cited Tribe in his brief for District of Columbia v Heller , a landmark 2008 case in which the court held that the second amendment provided for an individual right to bear arms .
Cruz wrote : â€œFor example , although arguing for a narrow construction of the amendment , Professor Laurence Tribe has squarely concluded that the second amendment provides a â€˜right ( admittedly of uncertain scope ) on the part of individuals to possess and use firearms in the defense of themselves and their homesâ€ ™
.â€
�
This brief is also posted to the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s
campaign website and Cruz has promoted his role in the case as one of his key accomplishments in public life .
As the 2016 presidential campaign enters a crucial stage , Trump has attacked on the citizenship question .
Last weekend , Tribe suggested in an interview with the Guardian that the issue was â€œunsettledâ€ � .
On Saturday , Tribe told the Guardian , via email , that he found Cruzâ€ ™ s citations in his supreme court briefs â€œinterestingâ€ � .
â€œApparently Senator Cruz doesnâ€ ™ t think Iâ€ ™ m too far left for him to cite me in his supreme court brief on behalf of 31 states as a principal authority on constitutional interpretation â€ “ when it suits his purposes , â€ � said Tribe .
â€œSomehow I donâ€ ™ t feel particularly complimented.â€ �
Trump has become a fan of Tribe , praising him an interview on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press as â€œa constitutional expert , one of the true expertsâ€ � and citing him in Thursdayâ€ ™ s debate .
Tribeâ€ ™ s views have become the bedrock of Trumpâ€ ™ s argument that Cruzâ€ ™
s
Canadian birth will leave Republicans on uncertain legal ground if the Texas senator is the presidential nominee .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a big question mark on your head .
And you canâ€ ™ t do that to the party .
You really canâ€ ™ t , â€ �
Trump said during the debate , in Charleston .
The constitution requires the president to be â€œa natural - born citizenâ€ � .
Speaking to the Guardian last week , Tribe noted that it was unclear whether someone born to an American mother abroad , as Cruz was in Canada , met that qualification .
Although Tribe said â€œthe kind of judge that I admire and Cruz abhors â€ “ a â€˜living constitutionalistâ€ ™ who believes that the constitutionâ€ ™ s meaning evolves with the needs of the timeâ€ � would find Cruz eligible , he thought an â€œoriginalist judgeâ€ � who shared the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s legal philosophy might not .
On Saturday , a Cruz spokeswoman said , in a statement : â€œ[Tribeâ€ ™ s ] agreement on a matter of the constitution gives further credibility to Cruzâ€ ™ s arguments
â€ “ even liberals recognize the straightforward facts about the constitution and the law.â€ � Regarding the Texas senatorâ€
™ s
recent statements about his former law professor , the spokeswoman added : â€œCruz is stating the facts : Tribe is a liberal and he supports Hillary Clinton so his attacks are clearly politically motivated .
That is a surprise to no one .
â€œRegardless , their agreement on certain matters of the constitution enhances Cruzâ€ ™ s credibility on the issues at hand.â€ �"
2016-01-17,"As political battles raged across the talk shows and within both parties on Sunday , ahead of the Iowa caucuses which start the presidential primary season on 1 February , Jeb Bush fired a salvo from the margins of the Republican race .
Referring to Donald Trump , the GOP frontrunner who spent the weekend happily deepening his argument with his nearest challenger , Ted Cruz , Bush told NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press : â€œThe guyâ€ ™ s entertaining , for sure .
But â€ ¦ heâ€ ™ s not going not win the nomination .
And I am.â€
�
The former Florida governorâ€ ™ s confidence is not backed by polling data .
According to the realclearpolitics.com poll average , on Sunday he sat in fifth place nationally .
That put the one - time favourite ahead of seven candidates in the still - crowded Republican field , but his 4.8 % return left him nearly 30 points behind Trump ( 34.5 % ) and well adrift of Cruz ( 19.3 % ) , Marco Rubio ( 11.8 % ) and even the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson ( 9 % ) , whose numbers appear to be in terminal decline .
Bush is off the pace in the two early voting states , Iowa and New Hampshire , polling at 4.5 % in the first state and 8.4 % in the second ( an improved figure which nonetheless leaves him sixth , behind New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Ohio governor John Kasich ) .
In recent history , only Bill Clinton , in 1992 , has won a presidential nomination without taking either of those states .
Nonetheless , Bush continued to attempt to take the fight to Trump .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not a conservative , â€ � Bush continued , explaining why he thought he was the only person to have gone after Trump on economic issues in Thursday nightâ€
™ s debate .
â€œShould the opportunity come up in the next debate to talk about [ Trumpâ€ ™ s ] bankruptcies , Iâ€ ™ ll do it .
Four times bankrupt .
He claims he was just using the law but a lot of people got wiped out because of that.â€ � Asked by host Chuck Todd what he thought was the secret of Trumpâ€ ™ s success despite his own efforts against him â€ “ which now include an ad that quotes Bush calling Trump â€œa jerkâ€ � â€ “ the former governor said : â€œWell , thereâ€ ™ s a lot anxiety .
People are frustrated with Washington ; theyâ€ ™ re frustrated about their own lives .
â€œThe big guy comes in and offers the moon and the stars , and people have latched on to that .
But the reality is heâ€ ™ s not offering anything to lift people up.â€ � Bush declined to say , though , that he would not support Trump if the billionaire won the Republican nomination .
The prospect of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders being the next Democratic president was â€œchillingâ€ � , he said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to win this nomination , thatâ€ ™ s my focus , thatâ€ ™ s
what Iâ€ ™ m trying to do , but anyone would be better than Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.â€ �
Asked if it was time for the more moderate conservatives in the Republican field to unite and pick one candidate to stop Trump and Cruz , Bush avoided the question .
â€œNew Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and Nevada are going to shape the contest in March , â€ �
he said , â€œand we have the resources and weâ€ ™ re on every ballot and Iâ€ ™ m going to do it.â€ �"
2016-01-20,"Donald Trump has expanded his polling lead in New Hampshire to a commanding 20 % margin over senator Ted Cruz of Texas , as the Republican presidential frontrunnerâ€ ™ s momentum widens in the second - in - the - nation voting state .
The real - estate mogul is now backed by 34 % of Republicans likely to vote in
New Hampshireâ€ ™ s 9 February primary , according to a CNN / WMUR poll released on Wednesday â€ “ the same survey that sent shockwaves through the Democratic race with a surge for Bernie Sanders the day before .
Trumpâ€ ™ s lead in the Granite State is now more than double Cruzâ€ ™ s support , which drifts at a distant 14 % , although that represents a six - point jump in support from the last CNN / WMUR survey of Republicans conducted in December .
The rest of the field , according to the latest New Hampshire poll , remains relatively crowded : Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is tied for third place with fellow Floridian Marco Rubio , at 10 % each .
Thereâ€ ™ s a three - way tie for fourth place , with Chris Christie , John Kasich and Rand Paul each pulling in the support of 6 % of likely Republican primary voters .
The rest of the field falls below the pollâ€ ™ s 4.8 % margin of error for support .
There remains room for positivity among the lower ranks , however .
A mere 31 % of Republicans surveyed told CNN that they have definitively made up their minds about who theyâ€ ™ re voting for , and Cruz remains the most popular second - choice candidate , with 20 % of primary voters saying that the Texan senator of Canadian extraction would be their runner - up .
On the issues , Trump continues to dominate with voters .
He was named the most - trusted candidate to handle both Isis and the economy by likely voters , with 32 % and 48 % of those surveyed saying that heâ€ ™ s best suited to tackle them , respectively .
Trump continues to be divisive among New Hampshire voters , however , with nearly one in three telling CNN that they would not vote for the billionaire frontrunner â€œunder any circumstanceâ€ � .
Bush is the only other candidate to crack the double digits on unpopularity , with 18 % of New Hampshire voters saying that they would rather vote for any other presidential candidate ."
2016-01-20,"In a recent congressional hearing , Ted Cruz ( one of the leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination ) first asked us to follow the science , and then misused and abused the very science he reportedly admires .
The contrarian scientists that were invited to testify are members of a shrinking tribe that every year has to work harder to deny the clear evidence of a human - caused warming world .
Those scientists were William Happer , Judith Curry , and John Christy .
They argued that the Earth isnâ€ ™ t warming ( or has slowed its warming ) or that satellite temperature measurements are the best way to measure the Earthâ€ ™ s temperatures .
In fact , satellites donâ€ ™ t measure temperature at all , but these witnesses didnâ€ ™ t mention that fact .
Additionally , the satellite measurements that they showed are from the middle of the troposphere , high in the atmosphere ( not at the surface ) .
Finally , the contrarians declined to emphasize that the synthetic satellite temperature data have been wrong for years .
The upper part of the atmosphere ( stratosphere ) is cooling as a result of the increased greenhouse gases while the lower layer ( the troposphere ) is warming .
If any measurements of the stratosphere bleed into the measurements of the troposphere , it can cause a cooling bias .
I had the ( dis)pleasure of testifying at a hearing in Minnesota where William Happer also testified .
He , Roy Spencer , and Richard Lindzen all made errors in their testimony that were repeated at the Cruz congressional hearing .
At the Minnesota hearing , these contrarians were representing Peabody Energy â€ “ the worldâ€ ™ s largest private sector coal company .
They focused on high - altitude temperatures in the tropical part of the globe ( near the equator ) rather than temperatures at the surface or in the oceans .
But it gets even worse â€ “
they combined two sets of satellite data into a single curve when in reality , satellite temperature measurements differ by as much as a factor of four depending on whose data you use !
The figure below is nearly identical to Figure 9 Exhibit 2 in Richard Lindzenâ€ ™ s direct testimony , and similar to Figure 3 in Exhibit 2 to Roy Spencerâ€ ™ s Direct Testimony .
You can see the schedule for the testimony here and access the filed court documents .
My rebuttal testimony is available here and my surrebuttal is here .
Climate scientist Andrew Dessler also testified at the hearing and his reports can be found here and here .
As I wrote last year and submitted in my court filings , the table below shows the huge spread amongst various satellite measurements .
Why didnâ€ ™ t the contrarians point this out ?
Why do they only use the coldest two datasets ?
Why didnâ€ ™ t Roy Spencer tell the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission that his work has been found to be wrong multiple times ?
Why does this Peabody Coal case in Minnesota matter ?
Well , the same arguments were made by Ted Cruz and his contrarian witnesses in December in Washington DC .
You can watch the video here .
You can read John Christyâ€ ™ s testimony here .
You can read Judith Curryâ€ ™ s written testimony here .
The similarity between this group of contrarian documents is shocking .
It is almost as if portions of their testimony were cut and paste .
I am not really surprised the Ted Cruz would question climate science .
And I am not surprised the well - known contrarians Judith Curry , John Christy , William Happer , Roy Spencer , and Richard Lindzen continue to question the mainstream expert consensus .
I am not really surprised that some of these scientists are representing fossil fuel companies in litigation or hearings .
What I am surprised about is that they are being so selective in presenting data and not telling the full story .
For instance , why donâ€ ™ t Roy Spencer and John Christy tell these judges and panels that they have had to revise their own temperature estimates several times over the past two decades when other scientists identified errors in their model ?
They originally claimed that the atmosphere was cooling , and now their data shows it is warming .
Why do these contrarians mislead by only showing some groupsâ€ ™ satellite temperature estimates while omitting others ?
Why do they neglect temperature measurements in the oceans and Earthâ€ ™ s surface where the warming is clear ?
Why do they falsely claim that there has been a halt or even a slowdown in overall global warming when no such halt or even slowdown has occurred , and in fact the warming is accelerating ?
Why do some of these witnesses refer to their own publications after they were shown to be hugely in error , containing undergraduate - level math errors ?
Why donâ€ ™ t
these contrarians and Ted Cruz tell us that the referenced satellite temperature recording team ( Remote Sensing Systems ) disagree with the way their dataset is being used ?
I invite readers to view this great video created by Peter Sinclair which includes interviews from many real experts who discuss this very issue in a clear and understandable way .
It will be interesting to see what the next contrarian argument is .
They have retreated to higher and higher elevations in the atmosphere to run away from the reality of global warming .
At some point , youâ€ ™ d expect they will reach escape velocity ."
2016-01-21,"The veteran billionaire speculator and philanthropist , George Soros , has launched an astonishing attack on Donald Trump , accusing the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the US presidency of â€œdoing the workâ€ � of Islamic State .
Speaking at a dinner in Davos , Soros broke off from giving his views on the fragile state of global financial markets and the migration crisis to decry Trump and Ted Cruz , a rival Republican , of driving muslims to terrorism .
â€œBy fear - mongering , he and [ Ted ] Cruz are doing the work of Isis , â€ �
Soros said .
â€œThey want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim community think there is no alternative to terrorism .
It turns the Muslim community into a breeding ground for Isis.â€ �
Trump caused controversy when he said there should be â€œa
complete and total banâ€ � on Muslims entering the US .
Trumpâ€ ™
s
words brought a strong response from Soros , who said it was â€œharmfulâ€
� when people did things out of fear .
The investor , made famous by his attack on the pound that led to Britainâ€ ™ s departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 , said the migration crisis was causing Europe to â€œfall apartâ€ � , adding that refugees had been treated better when he was fleeing totalitarianism in the 1940s and 1950s .
â€œI was a migrant for 15 years , but migrants were treated better in those days .
I could study , get a job , get travel documents , and think about making $ 100,000 before retiring .
All this while I was a displaced person.â€
�
Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the migration crisis worse by authorising Russiaâ€ ™ s bombing of civilians in Syria .
â€œHe wants the EU to collapse , â€ � he said .
He added that he did not think the Russian president was serious about reaching a political solution to the civil war in Syria .
â€œThe EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration , â€ � Soros said .
â€œThe EU is falling apart.â€ �
Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan for countries neighbouring Syria , Soros said he was thrilled that the German finance minister , Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble , a strong supporter of budgetary austerity , had backed the idea .
Soros said : â€œMost people know that something has gone terribly wrong .
It has to be put right.â€ �
Soros said on migration : â€œWe have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic .
It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.â€ �
On the global economy , he said the same conditions were in place as those that caused the crisis in 2008 .
â€œThere is a financial crisis and a bear market , â€ � said Soros .
â€œThe source of the disequilibrium is different .
In 2008 it was US sub - prime housing .
Today it is China , where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.â€ �
Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year .
There would be no further rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank would ease policy in March ."
2016-01-21,"Presidential contender Chris Christie has resisted demands to â€œsmackâ€ � Donald Trump as the Republican party establishment panics over the billionaire celebrityâ€ ™ s seemingly unstoppable rise .
The New Jersey governor was among four mainstream candidates who crisscrossed New Hampshire on Wednesday , bracing for a primary poll that could be their last stand if , as polls suggest , the Iowa caucuses are dominated by Trump and hardline conservative Ted Cruz .
Between them , they challenged the abrasive billionaireâ€ ™ s credentials as a conservative , and as a credible leader given his unwillingness to lay out how he intended to achieve any of his sweeping policy ideas .
However , frustration is mounting amid fears that the Republican party could tear itself apart , yet only Jeb Bush has attacked Trump head on .
Christie , hosting a town hall event in Derry , was confronted by a female US army veteran who asked :
â€œWhen are you going to take the gloves off and start smacking him around ?
You donâ€ ™ t have much time.â€ �
Often described as pugnacious , Christie elicited audience laughter by replying : â€œYou know , I think itâ€ ™ s the first time in my political career that people have said to me youâ€ ™ re not aggressive enough.â€ �
He went on : â€œListen , you know when I will ?
When I think it makes sense to .
Iâ€ ™ m not in this to just beat Donald Trump .
Iâ€ ™ m in this to become president of the United States and Iâ€ ™ m going to make certain decisions about when I want to say what Iâ€ ™ m going to say.â€ �
Christie also voiced Republican hopes that the opinion polls have been wrong all along .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s the other thing : everyone is kind of obsessed with him .
I donâ€ ™ t
quite get it .
Hereâ€ ™ s what I donâ€
™ t get about it : no one has voted yet .
How many times have you people in New Hampshire turned the polls upside down?â€ � Christie recalled working for George W Bush in the 2000 presidential primary when the polls put him ahead of or level with Republican rival John McCain in New Hampshire .
But come the results , McCain won by 18 percentage points .
â€œNow Iâ€ ™ m sure the people who were working for McCain thought that was going to happen but I can tell you , the news media didnâ€ ™ t think it was going to happen and the people working for Bush didnâ€
™ t think it was going to happen.â€ �
However , Christie could not resist at least a jab at Trump , who dominated media coverage again this week after gaining the backing of McCainâ€ ™ s former running mate Sarah Palin .
â€œI
tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event , â€œIf you get to ask a question , just ask him â€˜How?â€ ™ â€ �
I donâ€ ™ t care which of the things he talks about just ask him , â€˜How?â€ ™ See , I can answer â€˜how?â€ ™
And I can answer â€˜how?â€ ™ because Iâ€ ™ ve done it
â€
¦
No one can say , â€˜I donâ€
™ t know howâ€ ™ .
They can say , â€˜I disagree with himâ€ ™ .
But not , â€˜He
doesnâ€ ™ t knowâ€ ™ .
Thatâ€ ™ s the difference between a governor and Donald Trump .
Thatâ€ ™ s the difference between a governor and Marco Rubio .
Thatâ€ ™ s the difference between a governor and Ted Cruz.â€ �
He added : â€œIâ€ ™ m going to keep making my pitch
and I know thereâ€
™ s some of you out there , because plenty of people have come up to me just like you and said ,
â€˜Come on , youâ€ ™ re the tough guy from Jersey , slug him.â€ ™ You know ?
You know what I am ?
Iâ€ ™ m
the winner from New Jersey.â€ � Trump and Cruz are running a close race in Iowa , where caucuses are held on 1 February , while polls show Trump with a significant lead in New Hampshire , which holds its primary on 9 February .
Senior Republicans have been shaken by the populist rebellion within the party and fear long - term damage .
Bob Dole , the 1996 Republican presidential nominee , told the New York Times that he views Cruz as an extremist and said â€œnobody likes himâ€ � .
Some within the party are slowly resigning themselves to a Trump nomination , according to media reports , but others remain implacably opposed .
The mainstream candidatesâ€ ™ reluctance to lock horns with the tycoon may be understandable given his apparent immunity to criticism .
Confronting Trump has certainly not worked well for Bush so far .
His itinerary on Wednesday included a low - key event with two dozen military veterans at an American Legion hall in Manchester , where he was accompanied by former - candidate - turned - supporter Lindsey Graham .
â€œI try to avoid in these meetings to have a Trump therapy session , â€ � Bush said .
â€œSo , hereâ€ ™ s what I know to be true .
The president of the United States needs to have a steady hand , needs to have leadership skills , needs to have a backbone and a heart and brain , and needs to stick with things .
The worldâ€ ™ s a dangerous place and the way you bring order to the world is the word of the president
is meaningful â€ ¦
That does not require the unpredictability of the leading candidate .
That would be chaotic .
No one would know where we stand on anything because he doesnâ€ ™ t know where we stand.â€ � Asked about the endorsement by conservative firebrand Palin , Bush told the Guardian : â€œI admire her but Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s not a conservative .
He can get endorsements , but man , heâ€ ™ s been all over the map on positions and heâ€ ™ s not a conservative .
We need a conservative to win the conservative partyâ€ ™ s nomination.â€ �
The establishment vote is split , so gaining an edge in New Hampshire is a matter of survival .
Christie , the Florida senator Marco Rubio and Ohio governor John Kasich addressed the stateâ€ ™ s house of representatives in Concord on Wednesday .
Rubio carefully flattered his hosts , contrasting their sense of civic duty â€ “ they earn just $ 100 a year
â€ “ with the government - industrial complex in Washington .
â€œOne truth
I know is that independence runs in your veins , â€ �
he said , speaking under a full - length portrait of George Washington in the oldest chamber in the US still in continuous legislative use .
â€œâ€˜Live free or die.â€ ™
That call to action inspires and echoes through the generations .
If Washington encroaches on our states , we will forfeit much of what makes us different , and special , and unique from all the nations on the Earth.â€ � Kasich , reportedly enjoying a surge in the New Hampshire polls , also appealed to anti - Washington sentiment , telling the House :
â€œI believe in running our country from the bottom up.â€ �
Meanwhile , at his event in Derry that ran for two and a half hours , Christie condemned Congressâ€ ™ s vote last year to restrict bulk data collection , insisting that anti - terrorism agents should have access to phone records as long as they can gain a court order and work within the constitution .
â€œThis idea that weâ€ ™ ve somehow sacrificed civil liberties is insane , â€ �
he said .
However , he acknowledged that the debate over data encryption is complex and requires cooperation with the tech industry .
â€œI think to go at this with a sledgehammer and just pass a law would put us in an anti - competitive position vis - a - vis the rest of the world and create other problems .
But there have to be ways for us to be able to access this information .
We can not allow there to be dark corners of the internet where these people communicate and plot to kill people around the world and we have absolutely no way of figuring it out.â€ �"
2016-01-21,"Sarah Palin has endorsed Donald Trump for president and now itâ€ ™ s official : the Republican Armageddon has begun .
While the Ted Cruz campaign licks its wounds and remembers the days of hanging out with Palin on the campaign trail , Palin has taken her rightful place alongside Trump as the architect of his 2016 campaign .
Republican leadership and other evangelicals may be shocked , but this has been a long time coming and it shows the fracturing among evangelicals .
Ralph Reed , chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition said it best : â€œEndorsements alone donâ€ ™ t guarantee victory , but Palinâ€ ™ s embrace of Trump may turn the fight over the evangelical vote into a war for the soul of the party.â€ �
It will be a war , not only for the soul of the Republican party , but for the soul of Evangelicalism too .
The group is deeply divided between those who think Trump can bring America back , and those who donâ€ ™ t think he holds evangelical moral and religious values .
This deep rift between evangelical voters goes back to 2008 , with McCain choosing Palin as a running mate ; she was not a traditional evangelical , but a born - again Pentecostal Christian who attended an evangelical church in Wasilla , Alaska .
McCain courted in 2008 what I would call fringe evangelicals , in part because evangelicals were skeptical of his commitment to values voters .
McCainâ€ ™ s embrace of Palin came after having to scuttle endorsements from John Hagee and Rod Parsley , charismatics who believed in Armageddon and fiercely supported Israel .
Then , in 2012 , evangelicals were forced to choose between traditional candidates like Rick Santorum and Rick Perry , but Mitt Romney , a Mormon , would become the presidential candidate .
They rallied around Romney despite the fact that many in evangelical leadership thought Mormonism was not a true Christian religion .
The moment of true capitulation came when the Billy Graham evangelistic association quietly took Mormonism off the list of apostate religious groups .
Now , in 2016 , the Republican party and evangelical leadership have been stymied by the fact that Trump is drawing in the â€œreligious rightâ€ � .
Russell Moore , president of the Ethics and Liberty commission of the Southern Baptist Convention , has been very vocal in his criticism of Trump .
Other traditional evangelical choices have practically disappeared from the 2016 Republican roster .
Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal already proved that prayer meetings and courting traditional evangelical leadership are a non - starter .
Rick Santorum is barely visible on the campaign trail , along with Mike Huckabee , who at one time led in 2008 .
Thatâ€ ™ s largely because evangelical leadership is no longer found in denominational leadership , but in reality television and televangelists .
Even Phyllis Schafly , a longtime evangelical leader , supports Trump .
Evangelicalismâ€ ™
s
moral values are now articulated by reality stars like the Duggar family , who Mike Huckabee embraced , and Duck Dynasty , whose patriarch , Phil Robertson , endorsed Cruz .
Palin herself , an evangelical darling in 2008 , has had two reality TV shows :
Sarah Palinâ€ ™ s Alaska and Sarah Palinâ€ ™ s Amazing America .
These are the evangelical leaders of the 2016 election .
Meanwhile , Trump has courted so - called â€˜prosperity gospelâ€ ™ preachers like Pastor Paula White , a good friend of Trump , who arranged for other prosperity preachers to meet the candidate .
These leaders are the new conservative Christian support , which is predicated largely on wealth restoration , preserving the constitution and second amendment rights and spreading Islamophobia .
Moral values such as pro - life and opposition to same - sex marriage are taking a backseat to these issues .
While Cruz and Trump are both trying to court evangelicals in Iowa , this evangelical split will follow both candidates into the primary season long past the Iowa caucuses .
Cruz is the establishment evangelical choice , but it is questionable whether that will help him gain voters in southern states .
Trumpâ€ ™ s courtship of the prosperity gospel leaders , reality show Christians and Palin will likely take him much further than the traditional evangelical leadership .
This is a seismic shift in how the Republican party relates to the religious right .
Most political pundits will be derisive about the Palin endorsement , but it is time for them to ask themselves what her alliance with Trump means for the 2016 election cycle .
It is certainly more than the amusing side - show that many are treating it as ."
2016-01-23,"Senator Chuck Grassley introduced Donald Trump at a rally in Iowa on Saturday , using the billionaireâ€ ™ s â€œmake America great againâ€ � slogan , and hinting that mainstream Republicans could get behind the candidate if it meant the defeat of Texas senator Ted Cruz .
â€œI want Mr Trump to know I appreciate his support for me and most importantly for Iowa being first in the nation and our all - important Iowa caucus.â€
�
The veteran Iowa senator went on to attack what he saw as the unconstitutional actions of Barack Obama and told attendees they needed the same energy they showed Trump
â€œto win back the White House in Novemberâ€ � .
He also sounded some favorite themes of Trump , telling the audience : â€œYou and I believe in sovereign borders ; you and I believe in the right to keep and bear arms.â€ �
No federal elected official has yet to endorse Trump , although others , such as Alabama senator Jeff Sessions , have appeared at Trump rallies .
Trump described Grassley without his usual vitriol for career politicians , saying the senator was â€œa great guy , respected by everybodyâ€ � .
Grassley , a six - term senator who is regularly re - elected with two - thirds of the vote , appeared at the event on the same day that Texas senator Ted Cruz made a campaign appearance in Grassleyâ€ ™ s hometown of New Hartford , Iowa , population 514 .
The Iowa senator , known as the â€œhog farmer from New Harfordâ€ � , has never endorsed in the caucuses and long been beloved among Republicans in the Hawkeye state .
Jill Kozeny , a spokeswoman for Grassley , told the Guardian in a statement that the senator â€œhas been attending events for and with Republican presidential candidates ( all , I believe ) in Iowa since last summer , whenever heâ€ ™ s been invited and it can be scheduled .
â€œGrassley will be on the campaign trail with others , too , through next weekend .
Heâ€ ™ s committed to doing whatever he can to help elect a Republican president this year.â€ �
She added that the senator plans to appear at an event held for fellow senator Marco Rubio next Saturday as well .
A spokesperson for the Cruz campaign told the Guardian later Saturday that Grassley will also appear with the Texas senator on Friday at a scheduled campaign stop in Wilton , Iowa .
The Iowa senator declined to answer questions about his attendance at the rally , merely saying â€œIâ€ ™ m just hereâ€ � and â€œI just want to beat Hillaryâ€ � when the press shouted questions at him .
Grassley sat in the front row of the theater at Central College .
Grassleyâ€ ™ s presence at the rally is likely a sign of the Republican establishmentâ€
™ s distaste for Cruz .
Iowa governor Terry Branstad , another six - term Republican , told reporters that he wants to see the Texas senator defeated in the Iowa caucuses because of his opposition to ethanol .
Cruz is also deeply unpopular with Senate colleagues and a number of prominent Washington political figures , including Bob Dole , have explicitly said they prefer Trump to Cruz because of Cruzâ€ ™ s personality .
But few prominent Republicans have voiced their support for the real estate billionaire , who has instead courted support from figures such as Sarah Palin , the former governor and reality TV star who last held office in 2009 .
The Trump campaign did not respond to request for comment .
A Grassley spokesman said the scheduling was coincidental .
â€œEverythingâ€ ™ s scheduled based on logistics , â€ � she said .
â€œSenator Grassley has an event in Des Moines this evening.â€ �
Earlier on Saturday , Trump reinforced his reputation as the most outrageous candidate in the presidential field , saying his current dominance over his Republican rivals would not weaken even if he shot someone .
â€œI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody
and I wouldnâ€ ™ t lose any voters ,
â€ � the billionaire said at a rally at Dordt College , a Christian school in Sioux Center , Iowa .
The billionaire proceeded to belittle his rivals , as he often does , as well as Glenn Beck , the conservative radio host who has largely thrown his support to Cruz .
Beck joined more than a dozen prominent conservatives who declared themselves â€œagainst Trumpâ€ � in the magazine National Review last week ."
2016-01-23,"Theoâ€ ™ s
Pizza Restaurant is heaving , the anger and frustration palpable .
James Egloff drove his family five hours on a frostbitten day to be here .
Preacherâ€ ™ s son Ted Cruz , in blue jacket and open - collared shirt , does not disappoint , eviscerating the political establishment , talking guns and religion and prophesying a national â€œawakeningâ€ � .
The audience , clapping and hollering , loves his firebrand act .
At the Henry J Sweeney Post of the American Legion , meanwhile , things are not so hot .
Jeb Bush , in shirt , tie and suit trousers , works the wood - panelled room with Senator Lindsey Graham in tow .
The candidate is unfailingly polite and a little stiff , with agitation brewing beneath the surface .
He promises better healthcare for military veterans and a pragmatic strategy for fighting Islamist terrorism .
The retail politics of the New Hampshire primary , in which contenders for the most powerful office in the world must brave chill winds to shake hands and pose for selfies in unromantic beer halls and school canteens , are impressive in the digital media age .
But the contrasting energy in Manchester last week illustrated how the 2016 presidential election has confounded all expectations .
A year ago Jeb Bush versus Hillary Clinton looked like a safe , if dull bet .
No one dreamed that , with the Iowa caucuses approaching on 1 February , polls might be suggesting the rather less likely head - to - head of Donald Trump versus Bernie Sanders , a clash not of political dynasties but of popular movements .
Trump , 69 , a billionaire celebrity from New York who has never held political office , has dominated the national Republican race although hardline conservative Cruz , 45 , another outsider , appears to have the edge in Iowa .
Neither has the endorsement of a single sitting governor or senator .
Sanders , a 74-year - old socialist senator from Vermont , appears well placed to beat Clinton among Democrats in both Iowa and New Hampshire .
While she remains the long - term favourite , the former first lady could be forgiven for suffering stomach - knotting flashbacks to her defeat by Barack Obama in 2008 .
The 162-year - old Republican party of Lincoln and Reagan , and the 188-year - old Democratic party of Roosevelt and Kennedy , are facing simultaneous revolts from their own rank and file that threaten to reshape the American political landscape .
Both find themselves assailed by a popular uprising against Washington : Democrats disappointed that their president hasnâ€ ™ t achieved more in seven years , Republicans riled that their control of both houses of Congress has yielded little â€ “ and independents despairing of unprecedented deadlock on Capitol Hill .
Sanders told the MSNBC channel last week : â€œWhat we are doing in this campaign , it just blows my mind every day because I see it clearly , weâ€ ™ re taking on not only Wall Street and the economic establishment , weâ€ ™ re taking on the political establishment.â€
�
And Cruz bellowed at the pizza joint : â€œIf
you think Washington is fundamentally broken , that there is a bipartisan corruption of career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests and grow and grow and grow Washington , and we need to take power out of Washington and back to â€˜We the peopleâ€ ™ , that is what this campaign is all
about!â€ �
The crowd in Manchester , New Hampshire , erupted in whoops and applause .
Egloff , who had brought his wife and three children from New Jersey , has donated to a candidate for the first time in his life , giving $ 1,500 to the Cruz campaign .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t tell the difference between Democrats and Republicans any more , â€ � he said .
â€œThere is zero change with either .
Republicans are every bit as complicit as liberals .
To see Cruz coming along to blow everything up is so exciting .
We are sick of the entrenched establishment.â€ �
There is also a deeper dissatisfaction with the status quo .
As a small software business owner , Egloff , 45 , complains about high taxes and belongs to a generation that , while hardly destitute , feels constantly stressed and hard done by compared with its predecessors .
â€œIâ€
™ m being told things are better than they are .
I survive and I eat but Iâ€ ™ m not getting ahead .
Itâ€ ™ s not what my father experienced.â€ �
The United States remains the worldâ€ ™ s sole superpower and biggest economy .
Politicians constantly tell voters they are living in the greatest nation the earth has ever seen and stress the exceptionalism of the American dream .
But this may only help to inflate expectations and sow discontent .
Dan Cabanel , 56 , a financial sales representative from Concord , New Hampshire , blames Obamaâ€ ™ s health reforms for wiping out some of his insurance business .
â€œIf Obama had been a really good president , we wouldnâ€ ™ t have this uncertainty ,
â€ � he said .
â€œHe was supposed to be uniter , bringing the country together , but he has been the most polarising leader.â€ � Such frustrations found expression in social movements such as Occupy Wall Street on the left and the Tea Party on the right in recent years .
Now they are lapping at politiciansâ€ ™ feet .
Americansâ€ ™ approval of Congress averaged just 16 % in 2015 , according to pollster Gallup .
Rich Galen , a Republican strategist and former press secretary to Vice - President Dan Quayle , said : â€œI do believe there is a confluence of anger at the pillars of American society .
Look at what people have confidence in : Congress is down below used car dealers and reporters .
Weâ€ ™ re in an era when nobody likes anything and the two people most vocal about not liking things are Trump and Sanders .
From two different directions , theyâ€ ™ ve attracted people who like the way they see the world.â€ �
They divide along a line seldom acknowledged in US discourse : class .
Sanders draws strong support from graduates and students , whereas most of Trumpâ€ ™ s followers are on low incomes and did not go to university .
One hammers Wall Street , the other demonises immigrants , but both are perceived as authentic and unspun , right down to their oddball hair .
They are two sides of the same coin .
Neil Levesque , executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College , said : â€œI talk to many people whose first choice is Trump and second choice is Sanders , even though theyâ€ ™ re diametrically opposed .
People feel Trump is saying what they think , and if you asked supporters of Sanders , one word they would use is â€˜authenticityâ€ ™ .
A lot of this is the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street .
Those were the seeds and now the grass is growing.â€
�
The ground is fertile because of circumstantial weakness at the top of both parties .
Bush , 62 , and 68-year - old Clinton are arguably less impressive campaigners than the former presidents who share their surnames .
At a recent Democratic debate , Clinton presented herself as a continuity candidate barely distinguishable from Obama â€ “ hardly a cri de cÅ“ur at the best of times .
Bush , meanwhile , faces the additional complication of an overcrowded field , with the likes of Chris Christie , John Kasich and Marco Rubio threatening to split the â€œestablishmentâ€ � vote .
Angus Johnston , a historian of student activism based at City University of New York , said : â€œClinton has been wrapping herself in the Obama presidency and presenting herself as the successor but , in a lot of ways , Sandersâ€ ™ s campaign looks a lot more like Obamaâ€ ™ s in 2008 than Clintonâ€ ™ s does .
Iâ€ ™ m seeing in young peopleâ€ ™
s debates itâ€ ™ s
â€˜pragmatic and practicalâ€ ™ versus â€˜letâ€ ™ s shoot for the starsâ€ ™ because the Obama administration has not been the transformational force they hoped it would be .
Sanders is clearly responding to the energy coming off recent campus protests and channeling it in his own way.â€
�
As for Trump , Johnston continued , â€œWe see a reaction against the cultural trends of the last few years .
He attacks political correctness and the ideology of the left , calling for a ban on Muslims and wall to keep out Mexicans .
A lot of this is framed as a willingness to tell the truth .
Thereâ€ ™ s anti - Washington stuff and also more general cultural attacks on intellectuals.â€
�
Like Jeremy Corbyn of the British Labour party , neither man is quite as unelectable as they first appeared to the pundits .
Johnston said : â€œThe further we go into this campaign , the clearer it becomes that Sanders is not really a socialist .
Heâ€ ™ s a liberal Democrat and , win or lose , heâ€ ™ s in the mainstream of the left wing of the Democratic party.â€ �
Trump is â€œa very gifted speakerâ€ � from New Yorkâ€ ™ s Queens , home to various ethnic groups including a large black middle class .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not just coming from a position of rural whiteness.â€ � Twelve major Republican candidates and three significant Democrats are shuttling Iowa and New Hampshire with growing intensity as the day of reckoning nears , knocking on doors and making speeches in modest , no - frills towns in all weathers .
Voter Brian Pickowicz , 22 , from Franklin , New Hampshire , said : â€œFor the last 12 years Americans have seen the establishment at work , whether Obama or Bush .
They are done with the status quo .
The talking points are not working like they used to .
â€œDonald
Trump is running one of the best campaigns ever seen .
He is doing a great job of using fear and hate speech so people will vote for him .
Itâ€ ™ s kind of
scary.â€ �
But the establishment elders are not taking the parallel rebellions lying down .
Clinton , who has husband Bill on her side and remains popular among African Americans and Hispanics , has unleashed a series of attacks on Sanders in the past week .
Bush has denounced Trump as â€œa
jerkâ€ � and on Friday the National Review magazine published essays by 22 prominent conservative thinkers in opposition to the tycoonâ€ ™ s candidacy .
Former governor Sarah Palin , whose stream - of - consciousness endorsement of Trump last week entertained more than it informed , nevertheless hit the mark when she warned : â€œOur own GOP [ Grand Old Party ] machine , the establishment , they who would assemble the political landscape ?
Theyâ€ ™ re attacking their own frontrunner!â€
�
Some predict the Republican party could split in two if Trump prevails .
But Lindsey Graham , the South Carolina senator whose own campaign for the presidency crashed and burned , refuses to panic , insisting the widespread frustration will not last .
â€œIn the Bernie world , big banks are out to get you and the rich guyâ€ ™ s screwing you over , â€ � he said .
â€œIn Trumpâ€ ™ s world , the illegal immigrants are going to sell your kids drugs and rape your wife , and foreigners are going to take your jobs .
â€œThis has happened before when people had economic anxiety but it never pans out .
We always reject this .
It will level out .
Polling is just ether right now .
When people go into the voting booth and theyâ€ ™ re quiet , nobody there but them , New Hampshire particularly and South Carolina are going to take seriously the job of picking the next president .
Thatâ€ ™ s why I think Jeb is very viable.â€ �
Graham added : â€œThis is a fad that will pass .
The anger is real but the solutions make no sense .
We canâ€
™ t have 90 % tax rates and , on the Republican side , we canâ€ ™ t insult everybody in the world and become president of the United States.â€ �"
2016-01-24,"Ted Cruz was more right than he knew â€ “ the scourge of â€œNew York

he so memorably criticized in the last presidential debate is coming on thick and fast .
Itâ€ ™ s manifest not just in the candidacy of Donald Trump , but all across the presidential field , from former New York senator Hillary Clinton to Brooklyn - raised and accented Bernie Sanders .
Now the race is threatening to get even more New York - centric .
On Saturday we learned that Mike Bloomberg â€ “ the cityâ€ ™ s three - time former mayor and quite possibly the most New York person ever
â€ “ is mulling a third party presidential bid .
Bloomberg , who confidants say has been disturbed by the â€œtone and tenorâ€ � of the race and unsettled by the persistent rise of the Donald , wants to make sure America has yet another rich white New York billionaire to consider : himself .
In all reality , a third - party bid from Bloomberg could do more to help than hurt Trump .
While itâ€ ™ s not clear whom Bloomberg would steal the most votes from , and while many liberals donâ€ ™ t like his Wall Street coziness or affinity for aggressive policing , it also seems safe to say Bloombergâ€ ™ s patently progressive views on immigration , gun control and climate change â€ “ to say nothing of his support for abortion and gay marriage â€ “ are unlikely to sit well with fervent Trump supporters .
Bloomberg could , however , steal away the votes of moderate Republicans .
Trump has said he would welcome a bid from the New York technocrat , and called him a â€œfriendâ€ � and â€œgreat guyâ€ � .
Remember , though , Trump also attended Clintonâ€ ™ s wedding , and until recently had nice things to say about Cruz â€ ¦ before he had nasty things to say about both of them .
Bloomberg is presumably just as intent , if not more so , on going after yet another New Yorker : billionaire - hating Bernie Sanders , the self - described democratic socialist whoâ€ ™ s made it a personal crusade to break up the very same Wall Street banks that Bloomberg has made billions off of as his customers .
The former New York mayor has even said he wouldnâ€ ™ t rule out a third - party bid against the best - known ( adopted ) New Yorker of all : Clinton .
Clinton , a technocrat like him , socially liberal but relatively sympathetic to Wall Street , could see her campaign devastated by a third - party candidacy from Bloomberg .
Itâ€ ™ s not clear he cares , despite the fact that he has had a strong working relationship with Clinton and once encouraged her to succeed him as mayor of New York City .
Even if Clinton wins the nomination , sources close to Bloomberg have revealed several factors that might persuade him to run anyway , according to the New York Times .
The federal investigation shrouding Clintonâ€ ™ s use of email , for instance , could weaken her credibility , as could early losses to Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire .
The presidential race is threatening to become alarmingly New York - centric .
One New Yorker , such a city exceptionalist that he changed term laws to serve as mayor a third time , wants to challenge a New York mogul - turned - reality - TV - star - turned - presidential candidate , who wants to defeat the most powerful woman in New York state , who wants to elbow out a Brooklyn Jew - turned - Vermonter who canâ€ ™ t stop yelling at people in an accent perfectly personified by New York comedy legend Larry David .
But the Bloomberg story isnâ€ ™ t just potentially helpful to Trump .
Looked at another way , it could be a fortuitous turn for Sanders , who has long sought to frame his campaign through the lens of class warfare .
If Trump wins his partyâ€ ™ s nomination and Bloomberg enters the race , it would be Bernie versus the Billionaires .
For a guy whoâ€ ™ s struggled to consolidate a lead in a cycle dominated thus far by talk of foreign policy , an area of comparative weakness , this could be his big break .
But for my money , nobody is more pleased about the Bloomberg development than New York - hating Ted Cruz .
Though the initial consensus was Cruz went too far in the most recent debate when he criticized Trump for his â€œNew York
valuesâ€ �
, it was a consensus more driven by the media than by the electorate .
And in a sign of where Cruz thinks the politics lie , he hasnâ€ ™ t backed off the attack , issuing a â€œsorry - not - sorryâ€ � apology to further drive home his point .
Cruzâ€ ™ s attack , after all , marks the first time since Trump took over the race that someone not named Trump has changed the conversation .
And thereâ€ ™ s some indication that Republicans , at least in Iowa , care a whole lot more about traditional Christian ideas like Cruzâ€ ™ s
â€ “
ie opposing gay marriage and abortion rights â€ “ than about protecting their impression of New York values .
Thatâ€ ™ s what Cruz was trying to tap into in his somewhat clumsy distinction with Trump .
His execution was imperfect , but the attack was strong .
Now heâ€ ™ ll be able to draw that distinction not just with Trump but with the entire presidential field , and all the more so if Bloomberg jumps in .
Welcome to the 2016 circus , where the framing changes almost weekly .
Will it come down to a case of Bernie against the billionaires ?
Or Ted Cruz versus the New York values of Clinton , Bernie , Bloomberg and the third - party specter of Trump ?
Or will America face a kind of choose - your - own - white - New Yorker adventure : Trump , Hillary or Bernie , and Bloomberg ?"
2016-01-24,"A new ad from a pro - Mike Huckabee Super Pac directly targets Ted Cruz and Donald Trump for lacking the seriousness and dignity to hold the presidency .
The 30-second spot , released by Pursuing Americaâ€ ™ s Greatness , includes footage of Trump mocking New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleskiâ€ ™ s disability .
The narrator says of both the current frontrunner and Cruz :
â€œItâ€ ™ s hard to watch .
Itâ€ ™ s as if they forget they are both running for president .
An office held by great men like Lincoln , Eisenhower and Reagan.â€ �
The narrator then segues to proclaim : â€œLetâ€ ™ s get serious .
Weâ€ ™ re electing a president.â€
�
The ad then goes on to extol the positive virtues of Huckabee , a three - term former governor of Arkansas who won the Iowa caucuses during his previous bid for the Republican nomination in 2008 .
The spot represents a major part of the final closing effort by Huckabee supporters to give the Republican hopeful momentum in the final week before the Iowa caucuses .
Pursuing Americaâ€ ™ s Greatness is spending $ 750,000 just to air that ad on cable and broadcast television in Iowa in the week before the caucuses .
The ad campaign represents a much - needed boost for Huckabee , who has been lagging in the polls .
The former Arkansas governor has been relegated to the undercard debate and is consistently polling below 5 % among Iowa Republicans .
In contrast , Trump and Cruz are neck - and - neck for the lead in Iowa and are consistently the top two candidates in national polls .
Huckabee is spending the last week of the campaign before the caucuses in Iowa and is holding a rally in Des Moines with Grammy Award - nominated country singer Josh Turner on Monday ."
2016-01-26,"As is so often the case , the latest US presidential election polls seem to be sending different messages about whoâ€ ™ s up and whoâ€ ™ s down .
Here are a few words of analysis that might help you make sense of it all . 1 )
A CNN / ORC poll out today shows Donald Trump polling at 41 % nationally while Texas senator Ted Cruz trails at a mere 19 % .
Change :
This is the highest level of support Trump has received since CNN / ORC began polling this Republican nomination race .
Method : A random national sample of 1,002 adults contacted by telephone between 21 and 24 January .
Margin of error : +
/- 3 percentage points .
2 )
A national poll from the Washington Post / ABC News gives Trump 37 % of support while Cruz comes in second with 21 % .
Change :
Trumpâ€ ™ s support is steady compared to a month ago .
Method : 356 Republican - leaning registered voters were contacted from 21 - 24 January .
Margin of error : + /-
5.5 percentage points .
3 ) Todayâ€ ™ s Quinnipiac University poll of Iowa voters has Trump polling at 31 % and Cruz at 29 % .
Change : Virtually no change since their last Quinnipiac poll earlier this month .
Method : 651 likely Iowa Republican caucus participants were contacted between 18 and 24 January by real people via landlines and cellphones .
Margin of error : + /-
3.8 percentage points .
Analysis That CNN / ORC poll might sound like the best of the bunch ( decent number of respondents , low margin of error ) , but when you take a closer look , it gets tricky .
Thatâ€ ™ s because the topline numbers about Republican candidates are only based on 405 registered voters who are Republicans or Republican - leaning .
Suddenly , the margin of error jumps to five percentage points .
That doesnâ€ ™ t change the fact that Trump appears to be significantly ahead of Cruz nationally ( although the margin could be much narrower at 36 - 24 ) , but it does show the fragility of polling numbers that are based on such a small number of US voters .
Hereâ€ ™ s another thing thatâ€ ™ s worth keeping in mind :
Itâ€ ™ s easy to focus on answers to the rather simplistic ( and very hypothetical ) question : â€œIf the primary or caucus in your state were today , for whom would you vote?â€
�
But itâ€ ™ s every bit as interesting to consider what people say when theyâ€ ™ re asked who they definitely wouldnâ€ ™ t vote for and who they might vote for .
In a write - up of their poll , the Washington Post added up respondentsâ€ ™ first and second choices and found that the race tightened a little , with Trump at 49 % and Cruz at 39 % .
One last point to keep in mind : research has repeatedly shown that one of the best ways to predict whether someone will vote is to look at whether they have voted in the past .
As Ryan Struyk at ABC points out , those Quinnipiac polling numbers look very different when you only take previous voting attendance into account .
Still , whichever way you slice these numbers , thereâ€ ™ s one clear takeaway : Trump is doing great ."
2016-01-27,"Donald Trump told ABC Newsâ€ ™ Tom Llamas that Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s $ 1.5 m offer for a â€œmano y manoâ€ � debate on Saturday night is â€œa desperate attempt to gain more publicity.â€ � â€œSuper PAC money is dirty money , â€ �
Trump continued .
This may be the first time Donald Trump had a reason to thank someone at ThinkProgress for a campaign tip , but ...
In addition to booking a venue for his proposed â€œmano y manoâ€ � debate with Donald Trump on Saturday night , Texas senator Ted Cruz has sent a letter to the Republican frontrunner imploring him to attend for the sake of Iowa voters : Dear Donald , We owe it to the men and women of Iowa to ensure that they hear jointly and directly from the two leading Republican candidates so that they may contrast our positions on the critical issues we face as a nation as they make their final choice leading up to Mondayâ€ ™ s caucuses .
Accordingly , please accept this invitation to join me at an in - person , two - hour Town Hall event at Western Iowa Tech Community College in Sioux City this Saturday , January 30th at 8:00 p.m.
Central .
This venue is already reserved and I would propose that our campaign evenly divide available seating / ticketing .
Our teams can jointly work on the logistical details .
Additionally , I propose one of the following three individuals serve as a Town Hall facilitator : Mark Levin , Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh , If none of these proposed individuals are acceptable to you , I suggest that instead we alternate in fielding direct questions from the audience .
I look forward to your timely response .
Ted No word yet on Trumpâ€ ™ s response , although he did previously suggest hosting such an event â€œin Canada
, â€ � the place of Cruzâ€ ™ s birth .
According to a statement by Super PAC donors , Cruz is also sweetening the deal with the offer of a $ 1.5 million donation to organizations benefitting US veterans : Senator Cruz and Mr. Trump both respect the veterans and hold them in the highest regard but Senator Cruz respects the process and we are calling on Mr. Trump to do the same and debates are the purest form of democracy .
Iowans - and Americans - deserve to hear from the frontrunners in this â€˜two - man raceâ€ ™ one last time .
Not only would this be a heck of a debate , but it would also be a terrific opportunity to generate millions of dollars for the veterans.â€
�
The donors - Bob Mercer and Toby Neugebauer , who have committed $ 11 m and $ 10 m to Cruzâ€ ™ s super PACs , respectively - said that they would join together to donate $ 1.5 m to a charity of Trumpâ€ ™
s
choice if he were to accept Cruzâ€ ™ s invitation to debate on Saturday night .
Billionaire Republican frontrunner and aspiring solo
( debate ) artist Donald Trump gave a scorched - earth performance on the airwaves of the very network whose upcoming presidential debate he plans to boycott .
Speaking with primetime host Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly on The Oâ€ ™ Reilly Factor , Trump declared that â€œI have zero respect for Megyn Kelly , â€ � whose opening line of questioning at the first Republican debate in Cleveland , Ohio , led Trump to later insinuate that Kelly had been menstruating at the time .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think sheâ€ ™ s good at what she does
and I think sheâ€ ™ s highly overrated
, â€ � Trump continued .
â€œAnd
frankly , sheâ€ ™ s a moderator ; I thought her question last time was ridiculous.â€
�
Kelly ,
who will also co - moderate tomorrow nightâ€ ™ s debate in Des Moines , Iowa , has been vigorously defended by the network , whose â€œwise guyâ€ � press release criticizing Trumpâ€ ™ s ambivalence about attending the debate led him to declare that he would host an event in support of US military veterans instead of attend the debate .
Itâ€ ™ s unclear how the event , tickets for which are free , will raise funds for veterans .
Trump dismissed Oâ€ ™ Reillyâ€ ™ s numerous attempts to convince him that foregoing tomorrow nightâ€ ™ s debate is a fatal mistake .
â€œI believe , personally , that you want to improve the country , â€ �
Oâ€ ™ Reilly said .
â€œBy doing this , you miss the opportunity to convince others â€ ¦ that is true .
â€œYou have in this debate format the upper hand - you have sixty seconds off the top to tell the moderator , â€˜Youâ€ ™ re a pinhead , youâ€ ™ re off the mark and hereâ€ ™ s what I want to say.â€ ™ By walking away from it , you lose the opportunity to persuade people you are a strong leader.â€ �
But Trump , as he is wo nt to do , pointed that Fox News stood to lose a lot more than he will by his refusal to attend its debate .
â€œFox was going to make a fortune off this debate , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œNow theyâ€ ™ re going to make much less.â€ �
Trump - whose debate performances have been consistently middling - told Oâ€ ™ Reilly that heâ€
™ s tired of debating , and that the inclusion of candidates like Jim Gilmore , whose standing in national polls are comparatively minuscule , diminish the eventâ€ ™ s importance .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to go on forever with these debates - at some point you have to start doing other things than debating ,
â€ �
Trump said .
Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ campaign manager , Jeff Weaver , has issued a statement calling for additional debates among the Democratic Party presidential candidates : From the beginning of this campaign Sen. Sanders has called for more debates .
Secretary Clinton has not .
Now she is asking to change the rules to schedule a debate next week that is not sanctioned by the DNC .
Why is that ?
The answer is obvious .
The dynamics of the race have changed and Sen. Sanders has significant momentum .
Sen. Sanders is happy to have more debates but we are not going to schedule them on an ad hoc basis at the whim of the Clinton campaign .
If Secretary Clinton wants more debates thatâ€ ™ s great .
We propose three additional debates .
One in March , April and May and none on a Friday , Saturday or holiday weekend .
And all of the three Democratic candidates must be invited .
If the Clinton campaign will commit to this schedule , we would ask the DNC to arrange a debate in New Hampshire on Feb. 4.â€ �
Bernie Sanders wasted no time pointing out that while he may have just come to this eveningâ€ ™ s rally from the Oval Office , Hillary Clinton is at a fundraiser with wealthier financiers and Jon Bon Jovi back east .
â€œMy opponent is not in Iowa tonight , she is raising money from a Philadelphia investment firm , â€ �
he told the packed crowd in Mason City .
â€œI would rather be in Iowa.â€ �
â€œHere we are again facing the machine , â€ � says actress and activist Susan Sarandon as she introduces Sanders by recalling campaigning against Clinton for Obama eight years ago .
â€œThis is not about gender ; this is about issues.â€ �
There was no mention of Bill Clinton , however , who is just two miles away at a rival rally on his wifeâ€ ™ s behalf at exactly the same time .
Instead , Sanders is devoting an unusually large portion of his speech to attacking Donald Trump , who he clearly sees now as just as much of an opponent as Clinton .
As the overseas media begins turning up in large numbers to the event , Sanders also reminds the audience of the recent debate in the British parliament about whether Trump should even be allowed into the country .
â€œThink about how this man is going to deal with the world when he canâ€ ™ t even deal with our strongest ally , â€ � says Sanders .
Ted Cruz offered a direct challenge to rival Donald Trump on Wednesday , saying that he had booked a venue in Sioux City , Iowa , on Saturday night for the two Republican frontrunners to engage in a one - on - one , â€œmano y manoâ€ � debate .
Deriding Trump as â€œgentle Donaldâ€ � for his decision to pull out of Thursdayâ€ ™
s
scheduled presidential debate on Fox News
, Cruz announced that had already reserved a hall at Western Iowa Tech Community College for an one on one debate with the New York real estate mogul .
He initially challenged Trump to a debate in an interview Tuesday with radio host Mark Levin .
Trump , who is holding an unspecified benefit for veterans at the same time as the debate in Des Moines , had long hesitated to participate in the Fox News debate .
He had long complained about his dissatisfaction with tough questioning from anchor Megyn Kelly in the first Republican presidential debate in August , 2015 .
Her questioning led Trump to say that he thought â€œthere was blood coming out of her whereverâ€ � , a comment widely believed to refer to menstruation .
However , the final straw was when Fox sent out what Trump called â€œwise guy press
releaseâ€ � mocking him .
In the one - on - one debate Cruz suggested prominent conservative radio host Mark Levin as a moderator if â€œgentle Donald can not handle Megyn Kellyâ€ � .
He also suggested Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh as potential moderators if Trump found Levin unacceptable as well an option with no moderator and the two simply answering questions from the audience .
The event marked the continued shift in tone from Cruz who has launched blistering attacks on Trump in recent weeks .
Although the two had long been friendly and the Texas senator openly bragged about his refusal to attack Trump , he has since attacked the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � after Trump questioned whether the Canadian - born Cruzâ€ ™ s birth made him constitutionally ineligible to be president .
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on whether he would accept Cruzâ€ ™ s challenge .
Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is widely viewed as a â€œgoodâ€ � or even â€œgreatâ€ � potential president by Republican voters despite his perceived lack of religiousness , a new survey has found : Of the 56 % of Republican voters who see Trump as a potentially good or great president , 17 % say they think he is not religious .
Republican voters surveyed exhibited a very different pattern when asked about the other leading presidential candidates .
Virtually all Republican voters who think Carson , Cruz and Rubio would be good or great presidents said they view those candidates as at least somewhat religious .
Only 2 % of Republicans said Rubio would be a good president and that he is not particularly religious ; just 1 % said the same about Carson and Cruz .
The poll also reflected that having a president who â€œshares their religious beliefsâ€ � is important to Americans , a view commonplace among Republicans .
About two - thirds of Republicans say it is â€œsomewhat importantâ€
� that their president share their religious beliefs .

Expect our book report on the political science tome that everyone and their mother is talking about after the weekend .
Tonightâ€ ™ s Ted Cruz rally in West Des Moines feels like the event of someone about to win the Iowa caucus .
The room is packed , the national press has descended like vultures and there is an energy and excitement in the air .
The difference , though , is Donald Trump .
The rise of Trump has upset every rule about American politics , let alone the Iowa caucuses .
In a normal year , the suspense would focus on Cruzâ€ ™ s margin of victory .
But this isnâ€ ™ t a normal year .
This is Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s year and every benchmark that reporters have once relied upon can no longer be trusted .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign has released a short statement to supporters about his â€œspecial eventâ€ � in Des Moines tomorrow night :
With just 5 short days before the Iowa Caucus , Mr. Trump will be holding a special event tomorrow night to benefit Veteran Organizations at Drake University - Sheslow Auditorium and we want you to be there !
The address of the venue is 2507 Carpenter Avenue , Des Moines , IA 50311 .
The doors will open at 5:00 p.m. and the event will begin at 7:00 p.m. Register for tickets at TrumpDrakeU.Eventbrite.com .
Please arrive early and limit personal items to expedite entrance into the auditorium .
We hope that you will be able to attend this special rally in honor of our veterans .
See you tomorrow !
Sincerely , Team Trump Still no word on which veterans organizations in particular that will benefit from the event , or how the free event will raise money for those organization .
Also , a reminder for those desperate to RSVP :
The Sheslow auditorium is host to a mere 775 seats - so get those tickets while theyâ€ ™ re hot .
In politics , as in opera , it ainâ€ ™ t over â€˜til the fat lady sings .
But if FiveThirtyEightâ€ ™ s newest Iowa caucus forecast is any indication , the fat lady is cracking open a tin of Gretherâ€ ™
s
Pastilles as we speak .
According to the statistical analysis juggernautâ€ ™ s latest â€œpolls - plus forecast , â€ � Donald Trump and Ted Cruz each have a 44 % chance of winning the Iowa caucuses - the first time Trump has been seen as the ( co-)favorite to win the caucuses in the metric since FiveThirtyEight began crunching the numbers months ago .

Most of the other Republican candidates are staying mum on Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s announcement , but Texas senator Ted Cruz is marking the announcement with a hat - based fundraiser .

The hat retails for a $ 25 donation to Cruzâ€ ™ s presidential campaign .
Cruz - whose spokesman told Politico that thereâ€ ™ s no way that the billionaire frontrunner would skip tomorrow nightâ€ ™ s debate , â€œmark my wordsâ€ � - has been the most vocally critical candidate of Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to forego Thursdayâ€ ™ s debate on Fox News for his own â€œspecial event.â€ �
After news broke on Tuesday of Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to â€œprobablyâ€ � skip the debate , Cruz told radio host Mark Levin that he was personally challenging Trump to a two - person debate - â€œmano
y mano.â€ � Donald Trumpâ€
™ s counter - programming for the Republican presidential debate tomorrow night has officially been announced .
Here are the details , from the Donald himself :
For those keeping score , Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œspecial eventâ€ � will occur squarely in the middle of Fox Newsâ€ ™ presidential debate schedule - the undercard debate , featuring Carly Fiorina , Mike Huckabee , Rick Santorum and Jim Gilmore , will be aired starting at 7 pm Eastern , while the primetime debate is set to air at 9 pm Eastern , the same time as Trumpâ€ ™ s event .
At the same time as Trump campaignâ€ ™ s release of event details ( such as they are )
, the candidate tweeted a clarification of the reasoning behind his refusal to join the rest of the Republican field at the Fox News debate : Speaking of the Fox News debate : Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told CNNâ€ ™ s Wolf Blitzer that there wonâ€ ™ t be a Clint Eastwood - esque
â€œempty lecternâ€
� on the debate stage tomorrow night
- regardless of Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to forego the event .
â€œNo , I think thatâ€ ™ s pretty standard for debates , â€ � Spicer said .
â€œYou know whether or not they show up or not , or whether they happen to be offstage during a commercial break , that generally both sides have always had an unwritten rule saying that empty podiums will not be shown , and of course that will be the case this time as well.â€ �
More details to come : Thereâ€ ™ s no telling how long Trumpâ€ ™ s event will run , or even what the proceedings will entail - more Sarah Palin ? -
but if Trumpâ€ ™ s other events are any indication , the people of Des Moines had better start lining up now regardless .
If youâ€ ™ re just such an Iowan , free tickets are available here , but be warned : The Sheslow auditorium has a maximum capacity of 775 people , and Trumpâ€ ™ s events have a history of overselling - and donâ€ ™ t even think of protesting , silently or otherwise .
The endorsement game is afoot for Donald Trump .
Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€
™ s truce with Donald Trump has gone the way of the dodo , the Guardianâ€ ™ s Sabrina Siddiqui reports :
After cozying up to Trump for the greater part of last year â€ “ part of a longer - term gambit to eventually run away with Trumpâ€ ™ s supporters â€ “ the Texas senator made clear the time had come for the two to distinguish their candidacies .
The choice before Iowans , Cruz said , was simple : â€œWho has been a consistent conservative that we can trust to stand by our principles?â€ �
The poster behind him provided the answer , which the senator affirmed in a fiery speech delivered in his sermon - like speaking style .
While a second - place finish for Cruz might not be fatal , it would be more than underwhelming with expectations running high for his candidacy there .
So when Trump announced in the evening that he would not participate in the next Republican presidential debate , to be held on Thursday in Des Moines , Cruz wasted no time before he pounced .

â€œWe were treated as if we had come from the moon .

� While making her closing pitch to Iowans in the final days before the stateâ€ ™ s caucuses , Hillary Clinton stopped at a bowling alley on Wednesday where the screens bore not her initials but the Democratic frontrunnerâ€ ™ s â€œFighting for usâ€ � slogan .
It was the sort of backdrop candidates often choose as part of the retail politics associated with courting everyday Americans - Clintonâ€ ™ s own husband , former president Bill Clinton , paid a visit to a New Hampshire bowling alley during his 1992 campaign .
But Clintonâ€ ™ s visit to the Adel Family Fun Center , brimming with a couple hundred supporters , was not a photo - op .
It was instead a nod to the early days of her campaign , when the former secretary of state embarked on a low - key listening tour , and what she gleaned from that experience .
The local business in which she stood , with her back to the bowling lanes , was owned by Bryce Smith .
Introducing Clinton , he revealed they had met last April at one of the roundtables her campaign organized as she traveled between Iowa and New Hampshire reintroducing herself to voters .
Then , Clinton walked into the race as the presumed frontrunner and arguably the most well - known candidate to ever seek the presidency .
She remains the latter , but has found herself locked in a dead heat in Iowa and trailing in New Hampshire to less of a household name : Vermont senator Bernie Sanders .
Clinton has recently emphasized that she is the more electable candidate and continued in the same vein on Wednesday .
â€œDonâ€
™ t just focus on one thing in this campaign , â€ � she warned , drawing a subtle contrast to Sandersâ€ ™ idealism .
But by and large , Clinton focused more intently on her Republican opponents and the implications of Democrats ceding control of the White House in November .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like two totally alternative universes , â€ � Clinton said , after criticizing Republicans for denying climate change and clinging to trickle - down economics .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re living in reality , theyâ€ ™ re living in ideology.â€
�
She also invoked their fixation with attacking her , calling it â€œperversely flattering
but â€
¦ also instructive.â€
�
â€œThey know me , they know I say what I mean
, â€ � Clinton said , returning again to the idea that she was best positioned to take on Republicans as her partyâ€ ™ s standard bearer .
â€œA lot of folks have tried to take me out before , and Iâ€ ™ m still standing.â€

The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ben Jacobs says it all , really .
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is about to â€œfeel the Bernâ€ � from Red Hot Chili Peppers , which will headline a concert - slash - fundraiser for for the presidential candidate on February 5 in Los Angeles .
Tickets for the show will go on sale the day of the show , with prices ranging from $ 30 to $ 2,700 for a seat at the concert - not exactly the price most of Sandersâ€ ™ grassroots fundraisers are usually willing or able to shell out .
The lineup is a particularly Sanders - friendly one : All four members of Red Hot Chili Peppers have publicly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate , joining a list of dozens of other artists in signing a letter that endorses Sandersâ€ ™ â€œvision that pushes for a progressive economic agenda ,
â€ �
and â€œthat creates jobs , raises wages , protects the environment and gets big money out of politics.â€ �

Donald Trump was criticized last week for retweeting an acolyte with the handle â€œ@whitegenocideTM
, â€ � the latest instance of what some have called the candidateâ€ ™ s uncomfortably close following among white supremacists .
The incident inspired Marshall Kirkpatrick at Little Bird , a social - media analytics company , to analyze the Twitter accounts of the 21 people Trump retweeted in the past week .
Of those accounts , 28 % ( 6 out of 21 ) follow at least one of the top 50 most popular white nationalist Twitter accounts on the internet , and 62 % of them ( 13 out of 21 ) follow at least three people who have used the hashtag # WhiteGenocide lately .
Kirkpatrickâ€ ™ s conclusion
: It turns out that Donald Trump mostly retweets white supremacists saying nice things about him.â€
� Kirkpatrick also found that 114 of the last ( roughly ) 2,000 people who have used the hashtag # WhiteGenocide also have the word â€œTrumpâ€ � in their Twitter bios .

Buuuurrnnn Update : from the Cruz camp :
Buuuuuurrrnnn FiveThirtyEight profiles Ann Selzer , the â€œpolling Cassandra of Des Moines.â€
�
It doesnâ€ ™ t quite have the ring of â€œOracle of Omaha ,
â€ �
but it gets the point across .
Clare Malone writes : Selzer , who has overseen nearly every one of the Registerâ€ ™ s Iowa Polls since 1987 , is almost universally thought to hold the keys to their secret , fickle hearts .
Itâ€ ™ s a reputation that is not unearned
: She has on more than one occasion foretold an outcome that no one else saw coming , been pilloried for it , and not budged â€ ” the polling Cassandra of Des Moines .
And her rise has come at a show - me - a - hero time in polling , as the industry rapidly loses its grip on what has made it tick for so many years : Landline calls are fewer and farther between , and Internet polls might be the wave of the future .
Which is why this one question seems so pressing : What makes Ann Selzer so good ?

The last Selzer poll of the Republican race in Iowa , published on 13 January , had Ted Cruz up by 3 points , with Trump second .
On the Democratic side , Hillary Clinton had slid down to a 2-point lead over Vermont senator Bernie Sanders .
Rush Limbaugh , the pro talker , cigar aficionado and ragemonger , today went on the air and described his admiring understanding of Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to ditch the Republican debate .
From the transcript : RUSH :
Okay , where are we on the situation here with Trump and the debate ?
So far Trump says heâ€ ™ s not showing up .
He claims heâ€ ™ s not showing up because Megyn Kelly is going to continue to be a moderator .
And if you believe that , I can give you substantive reasons .
And itâ€ ™ s all in The Art of the Deal .
Trump is not that hard to understand if you pay attention to him and read his books .
In The Art of the Deal , one of the things that he makes a huge deal about is being able to know when to walk away and have the guts and the courage to do it . [ ... ]
But the rules of the game say when thereâ€ ™ s a debate , you show up .
Screw the rules , heâ€ ™ s saying .
Why should I willingly give them another shot at me in a circumstance they control , why should I do it ?
Whatâ€
™ s the sense in it for me ?
Iâ€ ™ m leading ; Iâ€ ™ m running the pack here ; why in the world should I put myself in that circumstance ?
Iâ€ ™ ve already seen whatâ€ ™ s gon na happen .
This Dittohead approves :
Hereâ€ ™ s a nice endorsement pick - up for Texas senator Ted Cruz ,
whoâ€ ™ s been making a full - court press in Iowa with former Texas governor Rick Perry at his side .
Tony Perkins , president of the influential evangelical group the Family Research Council , is joining Cruz on the campaign trail in Iowa , Perkins says : The support of core evangelical voters in Iowa appeared a few weeks ago to be Cruzâ€ ™ s to lose .
But with Donald Trump winning surprising backing among evangelicals , prominently including Liberty University president Jerry Falwell , Jr. â€ “ and with challenges from lesser candidates such as Mike Huckabee questioning the integrity of Cruzâ€ ™ s faith â€ “ Cruz has had to keep scrambling to capture values voters .
A subreddit has raised more than $ 1 m for Bernie Sanders , the Burlington Free Press reports : The â€œGrassroots for Sandersâ€ � campaign organized around an online message board has raised over $ 1 million for Bernie Sanders .
The board , with over 150,000 subscribers , is a subsection of the online discussion site Reddit , which allows users to organize around topics .
A Montpelier - based former grape picker , Aidan King , started the Sanders for President board in 2013 , alongside David Fredrick .
King now works with the campaign as a digital organizer .

The foundering campaign of Ben Carson , the retired neurosurgeon , has parted ways with most of
Carsonâ€ ™ s old core group of friends and advisers â€ “ Terry Giles , Berry Bennett , Doug Watts .
The informal adviser who always stuck , going on TV to put out brush fires and starting new ones , was conservative media personality Armstrong Williams .
Carson has downplayed Williamsâ€ ™ role in the campaign before .
Now
heâ€ ™ s downplaying it louder :
In Carson campaign trail news , Iowa senator Joni Ernst will join him for an event this evening , the Des Moines Register reports .
She previously appeared on the trail with Florida senator Marco Rubio .

Thanks for participating !
As long as youâ€ ™ re enjoying yourselves ! :
Bernie Sanders has emerged from his meeting with Barack Obama in the White House .
He says they had a â€œproductive and constructiveâ€ � meeting , discussing Isis , relations with Iran , and other points of foreign policy .
Sanders mounts a defense of the presidentâ€ ™ s foreign policy , saying â€œwhat the president is trying to do is the right thing.â€ � Update :
Sanders said he told Obama how difficult it had been , years ago , to go to many funerals , even â€œin my small state of Vermont ,
â€ � of young soldiers killed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
â€œIâ€ ™ m very happy to tell you that in the last few years that I have not gone to funerals ,
â€ �
Sanders told reporters outside the White House .
â€œI think what the president is trying to do is the right thing , â€ � Sanders continued .
â€œAnd what he is trying to do is to keep our young men and women out of perpetual war in the quagmire of the Middle East.â€
�
Sanders also found occasion to mention a certain 2002 senate vote : â€œAs
you all know , I voted against the war in Iraq .
And thatâ€ ™ s a major point of difference between myself and secretary Clinton.â€ � Donald Trump
is so steamed at Fox News that ... heâ€

Guardian politics reporter Sabrina Siddiqui checks in on Hillary Clinton at a bowling alley in Adele , Iowa :
More to come ...
A new video ad in produced by an outside group supporting former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee calls into question the sincerity of Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s Christian faith .
Huckabee won the Iowa Republican caucuses in 2008 .
Woman 1 : â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t tithe ?
A millionaire that brags about his faith all the time?â€
� Woman 2 : â€œJust what we need .
Another phony.â€ � The Huckabee video teams are working overtime .
The candidate is also out with an interminable and weakly humorous Adele parody : Do you understand how the Iowa caucuses work ?
Then youâ€ ™ ll want to skip this elegantly simple video explainer : Hereâ€ ™ s Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi with a look at todayâ€ ™ s polls â€ “ and all the caveats you need to make sense of them .
1 .
ABC News / Washington Post have a poll suggesting that nationally , the race between Clinton and Sanders is getting closer : the former Secretary of State got 55 % of support while Sanders received 36 % ( Oâ€ ™ Malley managed just 4 % ) .
Change :
Quite a bit - this is the narrowest the race has been between the two candidates since ABC News / Washington Post began polling the Democratic nomination - thatâ€ ™ s because Clintonâ€ ™ s support has fallen and because Sandersâ€ ™ support has risen .
The average of all polls from Real Clear Politics ( reminder : many polls are always better than just one ) suggests that that the contest was actually narrower in mid - January , when Clinton was ahead by less than 10 percentage points .
Method :
A national sample of 1,001 adults were contacted by cell phones and landlines and interviewed in English and in Spanish between January 21 and 24 , 2016 .
Margin of error : + /-
3.5 percentage points overall .
Among registered voters the margin of error rises to + /-
4 percentage points and among Democrat - leaning registered voters ( the group that really matter ) it rises even higher to + /-
5.5 percentage points .
2 .
Emerson College have conducted a poll which Jeb Bush is understandably quite excited about - it shows Trump on 35 % in New Hampshire , with Bush at 18 % , in second place for the first time in a long time .
Change : Iâ€ ™ ll say .
Looking at Real Clear Politics averages , the last time Bush was in second place was August last year ( when these polls were an even less reliable indicator of who Americans will actually vote for ) .
This poll is a huge outlier - at the moment those averages have Bush in 5th place behind Ben Carson .
Method :
Strange to say the least .
If Iâ€ ™ ve understood correctly , 373 adult registered likely primary voters in New Hampshire were called on Monday , January 25 at 12 pm through Tuesday evening January 26 .
They were called on landlines and then their data was collected using an Interactive Voice Response system ( flashback to the last time I tried to report a stolen credit card - we all know how great those systems are ,
right ? ) .
Margin of error : + /-
5 percentage points 3 .
A poll from Quinnipiac University suggests that Bernie Sanders is ahead in Iowa with 49 % of the vote compared to Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s 45 % .
Change :
Actually , not much .
These results are very similar to ones that Quinnipiac collected two weeks ago .
Method :
A total of 606 likely Iowa Democratic caucus participants were interviewed by telephone ( landline and cellphones ) between January 18 and 24 , 2016 .
Margin of error : + /-
4 percentage points
Although the Quinnipiac poll doesnâ€ ™ t show much change , there are some interesting results once you drill a little deeper into it .
The demographics of respondents suggest that Sanders and Clinton have a very different support base .
Younger voters , men , those from poorer households and ( perhaps unsurprisingly ) those who describe themselves as very liberal are more likely to say theyâ€ ™ ll vote for Bernie .
Clinton , meanwhile , is popular among survey respondents who are older .
Hereâ€ ™ s a little breakout showing just how big those gaps are : These numbers show just how important turnout is in shaping results on voting day .
If younger voters stay at home ( and they might ) , Bernie could be in trouble in Iowa .
Marco Rubio takes the high road in the Trump - Cruz - Fox spat .
Hereâ€ ™ s a statement tweeted by his comms team .
â€œThese kinds theatrics [ sic ] by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are an entertaining sideshow , but they have nothing to do with defeating Hillary Clinton , â€ � Rubio says in the statement : Rubioâ€ ™ s been hanging in a distant third place in Iowa for about a month now , according to Real Clear Politics polling averages .
Is there time to close the gap ?
Iowa caucuses in five days .
Rupert Murdoch wants Michael Bloomberg to run for president .
Murdoch , remember , is a political clairvoyant , recognizing Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s weakness early on in 2012 .
Or was that obvious .
Back in 1987 , Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders went into a small studio in Vermont to cut a folk album , undaunted by the fact that , according to the projectâ€ ™ s own producer , â€œBernieâ€ ™ s not a singer.â€ � Jim Farber has revisited the album , called We Shall Overcome , in a review for the Guardian : The way Sanders talks through the songs makes Rex Harrison sound like Pavarotti .
But itâ€ ™ s not the tone deaf delivery which transfixes the listener .
Itâ€ ™ s the accent .
If Woody Allen sang Woody Guthrie songs , theyâ€ ™ d sound like this .
Thereâ€ ™ s less dust bowl in these grooves than borscht belt .
Meanwhile , the arrangement of This Land Is Your Land features a reggae beat as only a pick - up band in Vermont could render it .
Hereâ€ ™ s a sampler !
Read the full piece here : A diner in Winterset , Iowa , has created a Trump burger : a third of a pound beef patty resting on half a pound of ham layered with grilled onions and melted cheese .
Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs ate it , for science .
At least he tried to :
In fact , the â€œyugeâ€ � burger was so big , it needed two hands to consume , and this reporter is forced to admit he left it unfinished , dropping out of the race early much as many skeptics once predicted the Donald would .
Check it out :
Yet despite the burger , Trump hadnâ€ ™ t won any votes in the Northside Cafe .
Both Valencia and Jahnke were fiscal conservatives who were wary of voicing support for any candidate .
But Abby Emmons , a waitress there who supports Marco Rubio , had a far clearer opinion of Trump :
â€œI think heâ€ ™ s a bit of a jackass.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s not
just Trump ; Megyn Kellyâ€ ™ s brash , unforgiving and often cutting approach to political interviews have made her a formidable opponent for politicians of every stripe , writes Guardian West Coast bureau chief Paul Lewis :
Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly is not the first journalist to incur the wrath of Donald Trump .
But she may be the first to have forced the combative Republican presidential frontrunner into submission .
Certainly , she must be the first TV anchor who dedicated an entire live broadcast to a news event that was , as she put it on Tuesday , about â€œyours trulyâ€ � .
That was how she reported that Trump was pulling out of the final Republican TV debate before the Iowa caucuses , essentially because he didnâ€ ™ t like the idea of being questioned by Kelly .
â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t get to control the media , â€ �
Kelly told viewers of her evening show , The Kelly File , hours after the billionaire real estate mogulâ€ ™ s dramatic declaration that he was withdrawing from the debate .
â€œWhile he has made his position clear about me after that first debate
, Roger Ailes made his position clear too , â€ �
she said , referring to the Fox News TV executive who has stood by Kelly .
She added that Trump had been bringing up the issue of her moderation of the forthcoming debate â€œagain and again and again and againâ€ � .

“ until two weeks ago
, that is , when Trump began sending serious ordnance Cruzâ€ ™ s way .
Now Cruz is fighting to hold ground in the Hawkeye State .
His flashiest gambit : challenging Trump to a one - on - one debate , with a moderator of Trumpâ€ ™ s choosing .
Trump has not picked up the gauntlet .
In a radio interview and rally Tuesday night in Fairfield , Iowa , Cruz hammered on Trumpâ€ ™ s withdrawal from the debate as a sign of weakness .
â€œIf
he thinks Megyn Kelly is so scary , what exactly would he do with Vladimir Putin ?
I promise you Putin is a lot more scary than Megyn Kelly , â€ �
Cruz told talk radio host Mark Levin .
At the rally , Cruz joked that Trump was â€œa fragile soul [ whose ] hair might standâ€ � if faced with tough questions .
â€œIf someone did that â€ “
didnâ€
™ t show up at the interview
â€ “
you know
what youâ€ ™ d say ?
Youâ€ ™ re fired!â€ � Cruz exclaimed .
The crowd , which applauded him throughout his riff , roared in agreement .
Following Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s announcement Tuesday that he would not participate in the Thursday Republican debate produced by Fox News , the network released a statement saying that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had threatened Fox anchor Megyn Kelly with harsh public treatment .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees , â€ � the Fox statement concludes .
In full : Capitulating to politiciansâ€ ™ ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards , as do threats , including the one leveled by Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , toward Megyn Kelly .
In a call on Saturday with a Fox News executive , Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a â€œrough couple of days after that last debateâ€ � and he â€œwould hate to have her go through that again.â€ �
Lewandowski was warned not to level any more threats , but he continued to do so .
We canâ€ ™ t give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees .
Trump video : â€˜Megyn Kelly is a lightweightâ€ ™
Trump is still replying to Foxâ€ ™ s earlier , sarcastic statement about how â€œAyatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairlyâ€
� :
Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Donald Trump says he will skip Thursdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate in Des Moines because ... he can ?
In a news conference Tuesday night , Trump attacked Fox News for slating Megyn Kelly , one of the networkâ€ ™ s top anchors , as co - host .
Trump complained about â€œthe wise - guy press releasesâ€ � that Fox sent out making fun of him for fearing Kelly .
Then he said he would hold a competing event to â€œraise some money for the wounded warriorsâ€ � .
Trump and Kelly have beef , because she once asked him a question about his past disparaging comments about women .
What kind of an irrelevant , tendentious question is that ?
Anyway , this morning Trump tweeted that he would not â€œcall Megyn Kelly a bimbo , because that would not be politically correctâ€ � .
Trump holds a 17-point lead in the Republican race in national polling averages , and a 59 % majority of political insiders in an informal , very insidery poll think heâ€ ™ s the nominee .
In other debate news , Kentucky senator Rand Paul has made it back to the main stage and former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore , who is still running for president despite no measurable support , somehow made it into the undercard .
Sanders to chat with Obama at White House
In the Democratic race , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is headed to the White House today for a surprise meeting with the president .
Barack Obama strongly implied in an interview published Monday that he thought Hillary Clinton was the stronger candidate .
But he has a visible soft spot for Sanders â€ “ who doesnâ€ ™ t need the president to tell people what heâ€ ™ s about , in any case .
Clinton will take a quickie break from campaigning in Iowa today to run to Philadelphia for a fundraiser featuring Jon Bon Jovi , the rock star .
Democrats donâ€
™ t think sheâ€ ™ s as honest and trustworthy as Sanders , according to new ABC News polling data .
Notice that 36 % of Democrats do think Hillary Clinton is more honest and trustworthy than Bernie Sanders .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Gary Younge went to a Trump rally last night ... ... and Jeb Bush has played the heathen card on Trump :
Hereâ€ ™ s where some of the team is deployed today : Washington correspondent David Smith is at the White House to cover Sandersâ€ ™ surprise private meeting with Obama .
DC bureau chief Dan Roberts takes over the Sanders beat this evening in Mason City , Iowa Sabrina Siddiqui and Gary Younge will catch up with Hillary Clinton outside of Des Moines this morning , while Dan will be at a Bill Clinton event in Mason City , Iowa .
Ben Jacobs is hanging out with former Texas governor Rick Perry and current Texas senator Ted Cruz , who have a pro - life rally planned .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s in South Carolina tonight ."
2016-01-27,"There was something striking about Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s backdrop when he took the stage on Tuesday at an event center in south - eastern Iowa , less than one week before the stateâ€ ™ s caucuses could drastically shape his presidential ambitions .
In red , white and blue , a large sign bore the phrase â€œTRUSTEDâ€
�
â€ “ a play on the Texas senatorâ€
™ s
name â€ “ with a series of accompanying adjectives : â€œCourageous .
Conservative .
Consistent.â€ �
But Cruzâ€ ™ s colleagues in the US Senate , where he has served for three years , have portrayed him as anything but , and his opponents in the Republican race for president â€ “ chief among them Donald Trump and Marco Rubio â€ “ have also sought to undermine his message by attacking Cruzâ€ ™ s positions on issues ranging from immigration and tax reform to ethanol subsidies .
But when Cruz appeared before a raucous crowd of supporters , he was nothing if not defiant .
â€œIf
you see a candidate who Washington embraces , â€ � the senator said ,
pausing for dramatic effect , â€œrun and hide.â€ �
The roughly 150 Iowans who had gathered to see Cruz erupted in a knowing sort of laughter .
Moments later , he suggested that conservative icon and former president Ronald Reagan was also loathed by Washington .
Cruz then expressed a desire to chart a similar legacy , with the help of those standing before him .
A first - term senator who rose to national fame by upending the norms of Senate procedure , Cruz is inching closer to a dream he has held since the age of 18 â€ “ to , one day , be president of the United States .
And Iowa , with its evangelical stronghold , has long been viewed as his for the taking , as the pastorâ€ ™ s son whose faith has played an integral role in his story .
Barring , of course , one not - so - subtle caveat .
â€œMy friend Donald Trump , â€ �
Cruz began , almost immediately after he was introduced by former Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry and Iowaâ€ ™ s popular congressman Steve King .
â€œSomeone must have stolen his Twitter account , because no one in their right mind would say nasty things about Bob.â€ �
Bob was Bob Vander Plaats , a prominent evangelical leader in Iowa who last year endorsed Cruz and in recent days became the target of one of Trumpâ€ ™ s social media tirades .
â€œIf he wants to engage in insults , if he wants to engage in attacks , my advice to Donald is to stick with me , â€ � Cruz said .
His words grew sharper as the day went on , a marked shift in recent weeks as Cruz and Trump have emerged as decidedly ahead of their opponents in the contest for the Republican presidential nomination .
After cozying up to Trump for the greater part of last year â€ “ part of a longer - term gambit to eventually run away with Trumpâ€ ™ s supporters â€ “
the Texas senator made clear the time had come for the two to distinguish their candidacies .
The choice before Iowans , Cruz said , was simple : â€œWho has been a consistent conservative that we can trust to stand by our principles?â€ �
The poster behind him provided the answer , which the senator affirmed in a fiery speech delivered in his sermon - like speaking style .
Cruz had led the fight against illegal immigration , steered a grassroots movement against Obamacare ( which led to the first government shutdown in 17 years ) , and bowed to no one in what he has dubbed â€œthe Washington cartelâ€ � .
Trump , he said , is nothing if not unpredictable .
â€œNext thing
you know heâ€
™ s going to say Iowans are stupid , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œHe already did!â€
�
a man shouted from the back of the room .
Cruz indeed did know , but had revived the infamous Trump line with precious days remaining before Iowans determine the outcome of the first nominating contest .
Because while Cruz remains well positioned in the state , his numbers have dropped in some recent polls while Trumpâ€ ™ s have largely remained steady â€ “ if not grown .
While a second - place finish for Cruz might not be fatal , it would be more than underwhelming with expectations running high for his candidacy there .
So when Trump announced in the evening that he would not participate in the next Republican presidential debate , to be held on Thursday in Des Moines , Cruz wasted no time before he pounced .
Addressing voters in Fairfield , roughly 30 minutes away , the senator broke the news of Trumpâ€ ™ s debate decision within seconds of his appearance .
â€œApparently Megyn Kelly is really , really scary , â€ �
Cruz said mockingly , in a reference to Trumpâ€ ™ s ongoing dispute with the Fox News anchor .
â€œI would ask that he at least show respect to the great men and women of Iowa , â€ � he added , before once more jabbing Trump .
â€œIf someone did that â€ “
didnâ€
™ t show up at the interview
â€ “
you know
what youâ€ ™ d say ?
Youâ€ ™ re fired!â€ � Cruz declared .
The crowd erupted into applause , hooting and whistling as Cruz twisted the knife .
â€œDonald
Trump is a fragile soul ,
â€ � Cruz said ,
whose â€œhair might standâ€ �
should he face tough questions .
His audience , which filled the large room of a convention enter and curved up a stairwell , was enthralled .
There were few lines they did not cheer .
That Cruz was strongly disliked in Washington , voters said , was a bonus .
Dan Cavanaugh , of Ottumwa , said he planned to caucus for Cruz because of the senatorâ€ ™ s
â€œsteadfastness , consistency and recordâ€ � , particularly in taking on the establishment .
Trump , on the other hand , was â€œa
celebrityâ€ � , he said .
â€œIs he a conservative ?
Nobody knows the answer to that question.â€ �"
2016-01-27,"Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is widely viewed as a â€œgoodâ€ � or â€œgreatâ€ � potential president by voters from his party despite his perceived lack of religiousness , a new survey has found .
The study , conducted by the Pew Research Center earlier this month , found that being an atheist continues to be one of the biggest perceived shortcomings of a candidate running for president , with 51 % of adults saying they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who does not believe in God .
But few Republican voters think Trump is a particularly religious person , when compared with other leading candidates like Ben Carson , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio .
Of the Republicans surveyed by Pew , 44 % said Trump is either â€œvery religiousâ€ � or â€œsomewhat religiousâ€ � , while 47 % said the candidate is either â€œnot too religiousâ€ � or â€œnot at all religiousâ€ � .
In contrast , the majority of Republican voters see Carson , Cruz and Rubio as religious people .
About 80 % of Republican voters see Carson as religious , 76 % see Cruz
as religious and 70 % see Rubio as religious .
The findings are the latest of Pewâ€ ™ s research on the impact of religion on presidential campaigns .
American voters tend to see Republican candidates as more religious than Democratic ones .
While the majority of American voters view Carson , Cruz and Rubio as at least somewhat religious , only about half say the same about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , and just 40 % of voters view Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders as a religious person .
â€œBeing seen as a religious person is generally an asset for candidates ; people who think a candidate is a religious person tend to be more likely to see that candidate as a potentially good president ,
â€ � the study authors wrote .
â€œBut many Republicans think Trump would be a good president despite his perceived lack of religiousness.â€ �
Of the 56 % of Republican voters who see Trump as a potentially good or great president , 17 % say they think he is not religious .
Republican voters surveyed exhibited a very different pattern when asked about the other leading presidential candidates .
Virtually all Republican voters who think Carson , Cruz and Rubio would be good or great presidents said they view those candidates as at least somewhat religious .
Only 2 % of Republicans said Rubio would be a good president and that he is not particularly religious ; just 1 % said the same about Carson and Cruz .
The poll also reflected that having a president who â€œshares their religious beliefsâ€ � is important to Americans , a view commonplace among Republicans .
About two - thirds of Republicans say it is â€œsomewhat importantâ€
� that their president share their religious beliefs .
For voters , a president being an atheist is a bigger drawback than one
whoâ€ ™ s had an extramarital affair , financial troubles or one whoâ€ ™ s used marijuana .
But the survey found that the share of Americans who would hesitate to vote for an atheist presidential candidate has been declining over time .
â€œAs recently as 2007
, more than six - in-10 Americans said they would be less likely to support an atheist presidential candidate , while just 51 % express this view today , â€ � the study authors wrote .
â€œOver this period , the share who say a candidateâ€ ™ s lack of belief would not be a factor in how they vote has been growing.â€ �
When it comes to religiousness and the Democratic candidates , about two - thirds of Democratic voters said Clinton is at least somewhat religious .
About half of Democratic voters said the same about Sanders .
For Clinton , views about her perceived religiousness is linked to whether voters think she would be a successful president .
About 69 % of voters see Clinton as religious , and said she would be a good or great president .
A similar link was not found for Sanders .
The survey found differences among major religious groups in views toward Clinton and Sanders , with more religiously affiliated voters who saw Clinton as a good president .
The majority of Democratic Catholics ( 69 % ) and Protestants ( 66 % ) view Clinton as a good or great president .
Among Democratic Catholics , 46 % said Sanders would make a good president , and 43 % of Democratic Protestants agreed .
But among religiously unaffiliated Democratic voters , 65 % said Sanders would be a good president , while just 57 % said the same about Clinton ."
2016-01-28,"Ted Cruz offered a direct challenge to rival Donald Trump on Wednesday , saying that he had booked a venue in Sioux City , Iowa , on Saturday night for the two Republican frontrunners to engage in a one - on - one , â€œmano a manoâ€ � debate .
Deriding Trump as â€œgentle Donaldâ€ � for his decision to pull out of Thursdayâ€ ™
s
scheduled presidential debate on Fox News
, Cruz announced that he had already reserved a hall at Western Iowa Tech community college for a debate with the New York real estate mogul .
He initially challenged Trump to a debate in an interview on Tuesday with radio host Mark Levin .
Trump , who is holding an unspecified benefit for veterans at the same time as the debate in Des Moines , had long hesitated to participate in the Fox News debate .
He had complained about his dissatisfaction with tough questioning from anchor Megyn Kelly in the first Republican presidential debate in August 2015 .
Her questioning led Trump to say that he thought â€œthere was blood coming out of her whereverâ€ � , a comment widely believed to refer to menstruation .
However , the final straw was when Fox News sent out what Trump called a â€œwise guy press
releaseâ€ � mocking him .
For the one - on - one debate , Cruz suggested Levin as a moderator if â€œgentle Donald can not handle Megyn Kellyâ€ � .
He also suggested Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh as potential moderators if Trump found Levin unacceptable , as well as an option with no moderator and the two simply answering questions from the audience .
The event marked the continued shift in tone from Cruz , who has launched blistering attacks on Trump in recent weeks .
Although the two had long been friendly and the senator from Texas openly bragged about his refusal to attack Trump , he has since attacked the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � after Trump questioned whether the Canadian - born Cruzâ€ ™ s birth made him constitutionally ineligible to be president .
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on whether he would accept Cruzâ€ ™ s challenge ."
2016-01-28,"If you lived in north - east Iowa , the evangelical stronghold where the battle for the soul of conservative American politics will play out in person on Monday , and happened to have given Senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign your email address sometime in the last few months
, you might find something especially appealing this weekend in your Facebook feed .
You might see , amid the family photos , a menacing video of Donald Trump talking about how â€œmy views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowaâ€ � .
LIKE ON ABORTION , blares the sponsored ad from Cruzâ€ ™ s deep - pocketed , social media - savvy digital team .
And you might wonder how this campaign managed , by paying Facebook , to differentiate between Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � and â€œOURSâ€
� .
Facebook , which told investors on Wednesday it was â€œexcited about the targetingâ€ � , does not let candidates track individual users .
But it does now allow presidential campaigns to upload their massive email lists and voter files â€ “ which contain political habits , real names , home addresses and phone numbers â€ “ to the companyâ€ ™ s advertising network .
The company will then match real - life voters with their Facebook accounts , which follow individuals as they move across congressional districts and are filled with insightful data .
The data is encrypted and not maintained by Facebook after ads run , the company said .
Acxiom , a massive data broker based in Little Rock , Arkansas , helps campaigns upload the voter info .
But a campaign operative said the Texas senator has been using Facebook ads to raise money , among other things , and a Guardian analysis shows Cruz - affiliated donors are spending $ 10,000 per day on Facebook â€œplacementâ€ � as the first vote nears .
In Iowa , the Cruz campaign is using Facebook to target voters on a range of broad issues like immigration controls to niche specific causes such as abolishing state laws against the sale of fireworks .
The Guardian understands the campaign has built a specific model for this relatively small group of voters , who may be responsive to Cruz ads against big government , and in some cases is going out to find them individually .
Political scientists , current campaign advisors and former digital gurus to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agree : a Facebook ad is perhaps the best money to spend in what could be a nearly $ 10bn election , and 2016 is fast becoming the year Facebook learned to profit from how you vote .
The acceleration of real - time voter targeting reflects a growing consensus that , in addition to knocking down Trump this weekend , campaigns of the future will depend as much on being able to track people across screens and apps as knocking on doors or sending out flyers .
Facebook profiles turned into campaign currency also offer another sign of Silicon Valleyâ€ ™ s growing influence in Americaâ€ ™ s political system .
The company in recent years has increased its lobbying efforts in Washington to press immigration , surveillance and patent policy , while doubling its political staff and adding other features to make it easier for campaigns to reach specific voting groups in what Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg this week dubbed â€œthe new town hallâ€

â€œFacebook is the easiest and most effective platform , â€ � said Zac Moffatt , the top digital strategist for Romneyâ€ ™ s 2012 campaign whose firm , Targeted Victory , has worked with most of the Republican presidential candidates and the Republican National Committee during this election cycle .
â€œThey are so much more valuable than they were eight years ago.â€ � Shaping perceptions , making millions Campaigns have been using Facebook to talk to voters since 2008 , when Obamaâ€ ™ s first bid for president famously used the platform to get supporters to push their digital friends to support the upstart senator .
In 2012 , Facebook began co - sponsoring presidential debates in the Republican primaries .
This time around , as Republicans spend big to catch up on Democratsâ€ ™ advantage on tech - driven campaigns , Facebook has launched another new feature to help campaigns target politically active users , who might post constantly about Trumpâ€ ™ s latest insult or share the increasing poll leads of Bernie Sanders .
Facebook will find users who like lots of political content and share it with their friends , mark them as â€œpolitical influencersâ€
� and allow campaigns to target them specifically .
As one of Facebookâ€ ™ s monetization executives explained to Wired after the quiet launch of influencer tracking in November : â€œPeople are more likely to trust information that their friends share.â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign began using this product immediately after launch .
Chris Wilson , the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s director of research and analytics , said the campaign had found success in targeting voters in this way .
â€œIt can help the message to spread far more quickly than other types of advertising , â€ � he told the Guardian .
Facebook is â€œplaying a key role in shaping the public perception of a candidate definitely more so than in the pastâ€ � , said Marie Danzig , former deputy digital director for the 2012 Obama campaign and now head of creative and delivery at Blue State Digital , a Democratic campaign group that also works with nonprofits and companies .
Part of the shift , Danzig said , comes from Facebook â€ “ long the place where cranky relatives debate politics and politicians ask for â€œlikesâ€ � â€ “ growing older as â€œmore and more of our grandparents popped up on thereâ€ � .
The presidential race was the most discussed topic on the site in 2015 â€ “ the year before voting starts , with the Iowa caucuses on Monday and a slew of primary states thereafter .
In the meantime , Americans in general are spending more time on smartphones and since the last election Facebook has begun serving mobile video ads .
In an earnings call last year , Facebook executives said that one of every five minutes Americans spend on smartphones is spent on Facebook .
It remains unclear how much Facebook stands to profit from its role in the election , but political spending on digital ads is expected to exceed $ 1bn in 2016 , up from $ 159 m in 2012 , according to research by media analysts at Borrell Associates .
Half of online political ad spending in 2016 is expected to go toward social media .
Analysts at Citigroup this fall estimated campaigns will spend about $ 607 m on digital ads during the 2016 cycle , an increase from $ 145 m in the 2012 election .
The analysts expect Facebook to edge out Alphabetâ€ ™ s YouTube as the leading recipient of that spending .
Those campaign spending estimates represent a sliver of the $ 5.6bn in ad sales Facebook reported on Wednesday that it had earned during the last three months of 2015 .
( The company said 80 % â€ “ about $ 4.6bn â€
“ came from mobile advertising alone ) .
Facebook does not break out ad spending on politics , and the price per ad is based on a constant auction .
Sandberg , the Facebook chief operating officer , told investors during a call on Wednesday that â€œthe 2016 election is a big deal in terms of ad spendâ€ � , comparing direct political advertising from campaigns and outside groups to the World Cup , the Super Bowl and the Olympics .
That ability to target , Sandberg said , was key : â€œUsing Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district , you can target by interest , you can target by demographics or any combination of thoseâ€ � , she told analysts .
â€œAnd weâ€ ™ re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.â€ �
Mark Zuckerberg , the Facebook founder and chief executive , said the company was trying to â€œintroduce organic ways the people can interact with businessesâ€ � as well as â€œthe politicians â€ “ not necessarily ads but organic interactionsâ€ � .
Sandberg was more specific in connecting organic sharing with targeted advertising : â€œWe think that kind of direct engagement , where people can hold their elected officials accountable and elected officials can speak directly to constituents , is a really important part of our mission.â€ � â€˜A tool that travels with youâ€ ™ Volunteers and operatives from more than a dozen campaigns are busy knocking on doors and blitzing old - fashioned mailboxes this weekend .
But perhaps the more effective direct marketing is being done far away from backyards in Iowa .
When Trump dropped out of Thursdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate in a boycott of Fox News , Cruzâ€ ™ s digital team turned around an instant meme â€ “ Ducking Donald â€ “ that went viral , but more importantly provided them with fresh email addresses , which in turn could become more donations and targeted Facebook ads .
The Texas senator told the Guardian in an interview last year that his digital funding and outreach apparatus â€œis very much the Obama modelâ€ � , but many Republican campaigns have accepted so - called micro - targeting as the new norm in spending unregulated donations effectively .
While â€œFacebook ads definitely donâ€ ™ t replace direct mailâ€ � , the companyâ€ ™ s increasing capabilities to match Facebook profiles against voter databases â€œallow better targeting and faster turnaround timeâ€
� , said Marianne Copenhaver , creative director for Kentucky senator Rand Paulâ€ ™ s presidential campaign .
â€œFacebook has been a game - changer for our campaign and for the entire electoral process , â€ �
she said .
â€œWe now have the ability to go live directly to the voters and reach thousands of people instantly.â€ � Features that target political â€œinfluencersâ€
� across social media are especially helpful as voters move from one address to another .
â€œFacebook is a tool that travels with you , â€ � said Eitan Hersh , assistant professor in political science at Yale University .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has paid at least $ 750,000 to a consulting firm with expertise in harvesting psychological data from tens of thousands of Facebook profiles , as the Guardian revealed in December .
Wilson , from the Cruz campaign , said : â€œ[Facebook ] is effective because it allows us to reach voters and itâ€ ™ s useful because it allows us to take our message directly to them.â€ �
He suggested Facebook ads are less intrusive because , unlike traditional TV ads , people can scroll past them .
He dismissed any suggestion of a discrepancy between Cruzâ€ ™ s past opposition to government bulk surveillance and his use of targeted techniques online .
In a telephone interview , Wilson said : â€œThereâ€ ™ s an important difference between what people share voluntarily on social media and what they have no desire to share , like their cellphone metadata.â€ �
On its campaign website , Facebook cites a 2013 study that found $ 1 can buy 200 ads on its newsfeed compared to two direct mail pieces .
Analysis of federal campaign disclosures shows the Keep the Promise group of Super Pacs , which support Cruz , have poured almost $ 100,000 into Facebook ads this month .
In recent days , its spending with Facebook has intensified to around $ 10,000 per day for â€œdigital media production / placementâ€ � .
Overall , this kind of spending would allow the donor coalition to place an estimated 20 m ads across the social network .
The next round of mandatory disclosures is expected to reveal a windfall of digital consulting fees on Sunday , allowing a fuller transparency of how Super Pac funding powers social media targeting to arrive just one day before the Iowa caucuses .
For all the talk of technical wizardry , it remains risky for campaigns to become overly reliant on digital acumen , said Harper Reed , the chief technology officer of Obamaâ€ ™ s 2012 re - election campaign .
â€œItâ€ ™ s just more complicated , â€ � Reed said in a recent interview .
â€œItâ€ ™ s so much more about technology than people .
Politics are weird - ass nuanced things.â€ �

2016-01-28,"Maybe the escalating hostilities between Donald Trump and Fox News in advance of Thursday nightâ€ ™ s Republican debate are best imagined as a three - cornered tag - team match :
Trump and his famous Twitter account v Fox News chairman Roger Ailes and anchor Megyn Kelly v Ted Cruz and the rest of the Republican presidential field .
You know , Jeb Bush and those other people .
Who is winning and who is losing ?
Itâ€ ™
s hard to know just where to start analyzing the scramble , but it is perhaps Fox News that comes out worst â€ “ unkindly torn between its three ill - fitting personas : responsible news outlet , ratings - hungry cable tabloid and right - wing political kingmaker .
Fox took a hit on all three fronts , a trifecta !
Trump , who announced Tuesday that he was bailing from the debate , which Kelly is still moderating despite his demands that she exit , looked truly awful for a while .
He still does to some extent â€ “ a bully trying to gain the upper hand by use of threats ; a coward attempting to evade a hard - charging journalist who had called him on some fact - checked and ugly statements about women .
Then Fox News jumped the shark .
The network issued a childish taunt , saying that network officials â€œhad learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president.â€
�
The official Fox statement got even sillier , to say that Trump â€œhas his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetingsâ€ � .
It was over the line , and Trump somehow began to look like the adult in the room .
Or , more precisely , the adult not in the room .
According to New York magazineâ€ ™ s Gabriel Sherman , the statementâ€ ™ s central author was Roger Ailes .
Trump has boycotted Fox News before , in September , after Kelly questioned his history of derogatory language toward women in the first debate â€ “ a strike that lasted all of five days , until he appeared on The Oâ€ ™ Reilly Factor .
His new boycott comes just days before the 1 February Iowa Caucus .
To their credit , Roger Ailes and Fox News supported their anchor .
â€œMegyn
Kelly is an excellent journalist and the entire network stands behind her ,
â€ �
Ailes said , even if it means losing Trump in Thursday nightâ€ ™ s
debate number seven .
Which it did , apparently .
Trump waffled for a while , but in the end bailed out .
He says heâ€ ™ ll instead hold a fundraiser at the same time , for injured war veterans .
Being Trump , he could change his mind again , I suppose , but the startling decision seems to be final .
Trump isnâ€ ™ t looking like the ultimate loser of this affair .
Nor is Fox News , where people will undoubtedly turn to see what candidates say in his absence .
You canâ€
™ t hold a serious presidential argument and expect the other candidates not to mention the frontrunner .
The actual losers are the Americans who care about who gets to be the next president .
On the eve of a big voting day , they wonâ€ ™ t get to see the GOP national frontrunner handle serious challenges , not just from Megyn Kelly , but from the rest of the candidates , several of whom seem to have realized only lately that if they donâ€ ™ t hit Trump hard he will win .
How would Trump have handled this ?
Weâ€
™ ll likely never know .
We should .
My solution ?
There is a long tradition in American politics of debating an empty chair .
Clint Eastwood gave it a try , to mixed reviews , at the last Republican convention , talking to an invisible Barack Obama .
As Smithsonian magazine noted in covering Eastwoodâ€ ™ s 2012 stagecraft , the tradition stretches back to at least 1924 , when the Progressive party vice - presidential nominee , Burton K Wheeler , took a stab at an invisible President Calvin Coolidge .
That occured in Des Moines , as a matter of fact .
In a manner of speaking , Trump will be in the room whether he gets a chair or not .
They might as well give him one ."
2016-01-29,"The seventh Republican presidential debate â€ “ and the first without Donald Trump , who decided to hold an event of his own elsewhere in Des Moines , Iowa â€ “ is in the can .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned : The knives were out for Texas senator Ted Cruz , who is polling second behind Trump in Iowa .
Florida senator Marco Rubio said Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign was built on a â€œlieâ€ � of shifting positions for votes .
It was a substantive debate .
Body cameras for police , Libya , Iran , Kim Davis , mental illness , Bridgegate , immigration , Isis , Obamacare , veteransâ€ ™ affairs , Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s affairs â€
“
it was all in there .
Speaking of shifting positions , the moderators strived to pin Cruz and Rubio down on immigration , using video medleys of their most blatant calls for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants to prove that they had in the past supported a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants .
The pair waffled .
The absent Trump came under early attack .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a maniac , and everyone on this stage is stupid , fat and ugly , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œAnd Ben , youâ€ ™ re a terrible surgeon .
And now that weâ€ ™ ve got the Donald Trump portion out of the way ...
â€ �
For multiple candidates it was their peppiest outing yet .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was notably animated , accusing Rubio of having â€œcut and runâ€ � on immigration .
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson produced the memorable line : â€œPutin is a one - horse country : oil and energy.â€ �
The crowd seemed against Cruz , booing him when he tried to wrest more time from the moderators .
The candidates , especially New Jersey governor Chris Christie , attacked Clinton .
Rubio said : â€œHillary does not want to run against me , but I can not wait to run against her.â€ �
Kentucky senator Rand Paul took a stand against government surveillance .
â€œThe bulk collection of your phone data ... did not stop one terrorist attack , â€ � he said .
A dutiful John Kasich explained how his experience as Ohio governor would help him deal with everything from the Flint , Michigan , water crisis to health care reform to the challenge of cyber warfare .
Read our live coverage as it happened here ."
2016-01-29,"The clear winner of the final Republican debate , just four days before the first votes are cast in Iowa , was the Macavity candidate .
Just like the mystery cat , Donald Trump was nowhere near the scene of the crime at the Fox News debate .
You could find him on rival news channels , but the damage was already done to poor Ted Cruz : the only candidate who could come close to beating him in Iowa .
Cruz , standing exposed in the middle of the stage , was subject to a barrage of fire from the moderators and his rival candidates .
And Trump didnâ€ ™ t have to do any of the dirty work himself .
At first , Cruzâ€ ™ s
Olympic - sized debate skills allowed him to shape the debate .
When Foxâ€ ™ s Megyn Kelly asked a tough question about why he flip - flopped on his feelings towards Trump ( he used to praise him but now suggests heâ€ ™ s a closet Democrat )
Cruz chose to answer a completely different one .
Cruz pretended that Kelly had asked him to insult the Republican frontrunner : an imaginary question he was only too happy to condemn as an outrageous attempt to lure him into gutter politics .
If they couldnâ€ ™ t snag him on Trump , the moderators would try national security .
Once again , Cruz proved himself a world - class question - dodger .
Chris Wallace asked him about his votes against defense budgets , so Cruz launched into an extended diatribe against Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s defense budgets .
Even when asked a follow - up â€ “ in response to a few barbed comments by Marco Rubio â€ “ Cruz talked not about his own position , but about his idol : Ronald Reagan .
In all cases , it is far easier to talk about Reaganâ€ ™ s status as a Republican idol than your own awkward budget votes .
Soon even the expert debater was wilting .
Cruz began complaining about â€œmean questionsâ€ � and offered an underwhelming joke about threatening to leave the stage .
The Des Moines audience seemed unamused , and began cheering for the moderator .
In an age when journalists are almost universally loathed , especially by Republican voters , it takes a special kind of candidate to elicit sympathy for the downtrodden media .
Then again , perhaps Donald Trump had recruited all the anti - Fox Republicans to his own rival event at the same hour .
Trumpâ€ ™ s absence allowed the moderators to train their fire on another up - and - comer : Marco Rubio .
Rubio blinked furiously as he dealt with a series of flip - flopper accusations on cap - and - trade legislation and immigration .
If blinking is a sign of nervousness , the young Florida senator was clearly unnerved by the moderators , who unkindly replayed video of his previous contradictory statements on amnesty for undocumented immigrants .
Rubioâ€ ™ s eyelashes fluttered until he could regain his composure to challenge Jeb Bush â€ “ standing beside him â€ “ for also flip - flopping on immigration .
Yet Bush himself looked liberated by Trumpâ€ ™ s absence .
He happily conceded that he too had flip - flopped on immigration .
Like his fellow third - tier candidates , Bush was far more confident and fluid than he appeared at any other debate .
That may be a low bar , but it reflects how far Trump has crushed his rivalsâ€ ™ spirit with his mere presence on stage .
John Kasich , who normally bumbled and flustered his way through a debate , seemed to be loving every minute .
When Wallace described him as an inside - outside candidate , Kasich pursed his lips several times in a strange kind of pout .
He almost loved the question so much that he wanted to kiss the moderator .
Later Kasich was confident enough to explain his position on social policy and the governmentâ€ ™ s ability to help those in most need .
â€œWe innovated the governmentâ€ � , said John Kasich , before talking about low rates of recidivism , drug addiction and mental health .
It might just have been the most substantive , meaningful response in any of the several Republican debates .
Which obviously meant that it was a terrible debating tactic .
There were no promises to kill Isis , and no canned lines attacking his rivals .
In a year of Mexican walls and carpet - bombing deserts , Kasichâ€ ™ s thoughtfulness will clearly lead nowhere .
You could tell the Trumpless debate was an almost normal presidential event by the nature of the closing statements .
There was something almost comforting in seeing the candidates fill their own suits , rather than Trumpâ€ ™ s .
Chris Christie , modeling himself on George W Bush , insisted that â€œterrorism in this country scares everyoneâ€ � .
Which is a statement the entire world can surely agree on .
Jeb Bush insisted several times that he had â€œa proven recordâ€ � , begging the question why he needed to mention such a proven thing quite so many times .
Marco Rubio ended his debate performance by citing the Bible , but Ted Cruz one - upped him by asking voters to pray on their decision .
But the line of the night came from the brain surgeon who somehow stumbled onto a presidential stage in 2016 .
Ben Carson quoted from the preamble to the Constitution , before adding his own memorable summary : â€œEnough said.â€ � How true ."
2016-01-30,"Ted Cruz began his last weekend before the Iowa caucuses by describing a bloodcurdling , dystopian vision of Americaâ€ ™ s future â€ “ out - of - control judges , monuments stripped bare , â€œabortion on demandâ€ � â€ “ that will come to fruition if anyone else is elected president .
At a sometimes awkward early morning gathering in a middle school in snowy Hubbard , 60 miles north of Des Moines , the Texas senator warned that even other Republicans would put at risk religious freedoms if they were in the Oval Office , and would allow a â€œlawlessâ€ � supreme court to push a radical leftwing agenda .
â€œWe are one justice away from the supreme court taking away every single restriction on abortion and mandating abortion on demand , â€ � he said ,
â€œup to the moment of birthâ€ � .
With the next president potentially able to nominate four new supreme court judges , Cruz said the nation was merely â€œone justice
awayâ€ � from â€œveteransâ€
™ memorials being torn down if any have religious symbols
â€ ¦ chisels coming out to chisel off crosses and Stars of David on the tombstonesâ€ � .
Cruz , a former supreme court clerk , argued before the court as Texas solicitor general and written 70 briefs to justices .
He loudly supported John Roberts during confirmation hearings to join the court in 2005 , but on Saturday claimed the Republican appointee and one of his colleagues on the court were â€œdisastersâ€ � .
The senator vowed to elect â€œprincipled and proven constitutional conservativesâ€ � .
About 150 supporters , mostly crowded around child - sized dining tables , heard Cruz vow to order a criminal investigation into Planned Parenthood on day one as president , right after rescinding â€œevery single illegal unconstitutional executive action taken by President Obamaâ€ � .
After that , he said , he would tell the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) to end religious persecution , before using day two in the White House to rip the Iran nuclear deal to shreds , move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and repeal Obamacare .
He was challenged by one man who wanted to know what Cruzâ€ ™ s idea for replacing Obamacare would look like ; the questioner noted that his own brother - in - law had only gained health insurance in a losing battle against cancer because of Obamaâ€ ™ s healthcare reforms .
In an awkward exchange , Cruz faced the man and told him that in spite of his familyâ€ ™ s experience , millions of Americans had lost their health coverage because of Obamacare .
Urging Republicans to caucus for him on Monday , Cruz said : â€œWho do you know who will kill the terrorists , defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?â€ �
Cruz has ratcheted up his rhetoric to apocalyptic extremes in private settings for months , once telling a small , worried child , â€œyes , your world is on fireâ€ � .
But locked in a tight race for Iowa with Donald Trump and a rising Marco Rubio , the Texas senator has had to press hard to expand from his base of highly conservative supporters .
Abby Coster , a mother of six and Cruz caucus captain for nearby Ellsworth , said she was backing the Texas senator for his integrity and willingness to stand up to Congress .
â€œDonald
Trump is for himself ,
â€ �
she said of the national frontrunner , â€œwe have no idea what he actually would be as a president .
I donâ€
™ t think he has the integrity because he is a salesman , the product is himself and he will say anything .
â€œAs for Marco Rubio
, I honor him , I think he is a very good Christian man .
He would make a good president , however , he failed to keep his commitments to the people of Florida concerning immigration and amnesty.â€ �"
2016-01-31,"Ted Cruz has come under fire just two days before the Iowa caucuses for sending mailers to voters here that accuse them of a â€œvoting violationâ€ � , earning the Texas senator and his campaign a formal denunciation by top officials in the first - in - the - nation voting state .
The mailers , which came to light on Friday and were confirmed by Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign as their own , include a voting score and the phrase â€œofficial public recordâ€ � .
They call out by name not only the recipients , but also their neighbors , as part of a broader attempt to shame Iowans for not having participated in prior elections .
Paul Pate , Iowaâ€ ™ s Republican secretary of state , condemned Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign on Saturday for distributing the mailers .
He said the strategy â€œmisrepresents the role of my office , and worse , misrepresents Iowa election lawâ€ � .
â€œAccusing citizens of Iowa of a â€˜voting violationâ€ ™ based on Iowa caucus participation , or lack thereof , is false representation of an official act , â€ �
Pate said in a statement .
â€œThere is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting .
Any insinuation or statement to the contrary is wrong and I believe it is not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa caucuses.â€ �
Cruz struck a defiant tone in a swift response : â€œI apologize to nobody for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote , â€ � he said at a press conference in Sioux City on Saturday evening .
The senator went on to argue that the Iowa Republican party had previously used such mailers and characterized them as â€œroutineâ€ � .
The literature was â€œa standard mailer that folks at the Iowa Republican party and other get - out - the - vote groups have used to help motivate low - propensity voters , â€ � said Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to do everything we can to turn these folks out.â€ � Matt Schultz , Cruzâ€ ™ s Iowa state chairman and a former secretary of state here , added that the mailer was modelled after similar mailers in the 2014 midterm elections that were sent out by the Republican party of Iowa .
Those mailers , he said , â€œhelped elect numerous Republican candidates during that cycleâ€ � .
Steve Deace , an influential conservative radio host and key surrogate for Cruz , also dismissed the backlash â€ “ after he initially declared that the mailers were fake , and corrected himself later .
â€œWatching the same people not outraged when Cruz was called a fake Christian now pretend to be outraged by a mailer is , well , horse puckey , â€ � Deace wrote on Twitter .
Even so , Cruzâ€ ™ s tactics raised eyebrows across the political spectrum for their directness .
One Iowan tweeted his outrage with a picture of the mailer , which included an F rating for how he had voted in the past .
The man said he had not been planning to caucus , but upon receiving the mailer he was , in fact , persuaded to caucus â€ “ for Florida senator Marco Rubio , one of Cruzâ€
™ s chief opponents .
Asked about the mailers on Saturday , Rubio told reporters he had heard about them from voters who were upset and â€œdisturbedâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s kind of an unusual way to end your campaign in a state , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t sound like heâ€ ™
s feeling too good .
It sounds like heâ€ ™ s under pressure and maybe not reacting very well to it , which is problematic because presidents are under pressure every day.â€ �

2016-01-31,"The likely next president of the United States appeared on stage in Iowa on Saturday night as huge crowds of enthusiastic supporters were joined by rock stars , televangelists and duck hunters in a frenzy of political campaigning .
Working out which of several simultaneous rallies actually contained the future occupant of the White House was less easy , however , as voters in the state prepare to launch the nationwide process of picking Republican and Democratic nominees on Monday amid unusually tight primary races in both parties .
Just before the last - minute crescendo of campaigning began , a highly regarded opinion poll by the Des Moines Register newspaper saw Donald Trump retaking the top spot in the Republican race from Ted Cruz , and Hillary Clinton clinging to a narrower lead over Bernie Sanders among Democrats .
But the energy was with Sanders and Cruz on Saturday night at lively rallies that suggested neither challenger was out of their respective race yet .
Sanders drew the biggest crowds as an estimated 5,000 supporters descended on the University of Iowa in Iowa City to hear the Vermont senator supported by performances from bands including Vampire Weekend and Foster the People .
â€œThe pundits say young people donâ€ ™ t vote , â€ � he told the many students in the audience .
â€œHow would you like to make the pundits look dumb on election night?â€ � Vampire Weekend , who admitted that one of their earlier songs had an inappropriately â€œnihilisticâ€ � theme , were joined on stage at the end of the night by the senator and his wife Jane Sanders for a rousing finale of Woody
Guthrieâ€
™ s
This Land is Your Land .
The 1940 folk classic has long been a favourite of Sandersâ€ ™ and its lyrics chimed poignantly with his cry to seize back American democracy from the billionaire class : â€œfrom California to the New York island , from the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters , this land was made for you and meâ€ � .
Earlier , Sanders had sought to manage expectations in an interview with the Guardian , stressing how far his insurgent campaign had come since he first began challenging Clinton from the left .
â€œWhat is interesting about Iowa is there are 44 delegates at stake and the truth is I think at the end of the day whether I win or I lose , the number of delegates we each get is going to be like this , â€ �
he said , holding forefinger and thumb together to indicate how close this more meaningful measure of success could be even if he loses overall .
â€œThere is a symbolic thing about winning here , which I admit â€ ¦
I want to win here in Iowa and weâ€ ™ ve got a shot
, â€ � added Sanders in remarks shortly before the Des Moines Register poll .
â€œBut we are in this race to run to the convention .
People have underestimated this campaign from day one.â€ � Half an hour up the road Hillary Clinton was joined by husband Bill and daughter Chelsea at a smaller , though similarly upbeat , event at a high school in Cedar Rapids .
Her warm - up band however was made up of four young men , who told reporters that while they were undecided as caucus - goers , they were inclined to favor Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination .
Two days before the state will hold the first nominating contest of 2016 , this embodied in many ways Clintonâ€ ™ s predicament : a struggle to resonate , particularly with young voters who have been drawn to Sanders in droves .
Taking the stage with her husband , Bill , and daughter , Chelsea , Clinton sought to once again drive home the idea that Sanders was merely a shiny object : attractive and principled , but without a realistic plan to achieve the ambitious goals he has pledged to a larger - than - expected grassroots movement .
â€œI am a progressive that actually likes to make progress .
That is what I believe in , â€ �
Clinton said before a raucous crowd of 1,100 people .
â€œWhat we need is a plan and a commitment.â€
�
She was interrupted by a woman who shouted :
â€œAnd you!â€ � Bill Clinton made precisely the same point .
What the White House needed , he said in warming up the crowd , was a seasoned hand .
With his signature charisma the former president reflected on his wifeâ€ ™ s history of advocacy â€ “ for children , for women , and for middle and working class Americans .
â€œEvery place
sheâ€ ™ s ever been sheâ€ ™ s made better , â€ � he said .
â€œShe always makes something good happen.â€
�
Roles were also reversed in the Republican race where Donald Trump broke with his standard formula of a pumped - up rally for something that looked more like a Saturday night talk show .
The billionaire sat on a stage for a softball interview with the Christian evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. Rows of the Adler Theater were packed with popcorn - eating spectators , many of whom appeared to have crossed the nearby border with Illinois to see the billionaire former star of The Apprentice .
â€œThis is a movement , â€ �
he said in Davenport , on the eastern edge of the state .
â€œNothing like this has ever happened before.â€
�
The format may have been different , but during the 35-minute show the audience was given a glimpse of the rambling , unscripted monologues that have defined his presidential campaign , one that always seizes on his remarkable poll numbers .
He briefly mentioned the Des Moines Registerâ€ ™ s result that he said had made him â€œvery happyâ€ � .
Trump said he was most heartened by the underlying data in the newspaperâ€ ™ s poll that showed an increase in support from evangelicals .
He attributed that to Falwell , president of a deeply Christian college in Virginia and son of one Americaâ€ ™ s most famous conservative preachers .
The billionaire insisted Falwell was â€œa man of faithâ€ � .
â€œMaybe Iâ€ ™
m a little bit not as good as he is in that way , â€ � Trump said .
â€œBut Iâ€ ™ m good.â€ �
There was a brief interruption , shortly after the Q&amp;A was over and Trump was shaking hands with supporters , from a small crowd of students who broke out in a chant of â€œFeel
The Bernâ€ � .
It was largely drowned out by a rendition over the loudspeakers of opera singer Pavarottiâ€ ™ s famous rendition of Nessun Dorma .
But in Sioux City , Ted Cruz addressed a packed room of supporters in a community college auditorium with more of the celebrity buzz that surrounds Sanders .
A near - dozen introductory speakers preceded the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s appearance .
These included two special guests , Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson and conservative talk show host Glenn Beck .
Robertson urged attendees to blow duck calls that the campaign had handed out in order to entice Donald Trump , whom he called â€œDonald Duckâ€ � to come debate Cruz .
He was followed by Beck who gave a half - hour stemwinder that included the media personality brandishing George Washingtonâ€ ™ s personal copy of Don Quixote .
Cruz finally took the stage an hour and half after the scheduled start of the event and soon started to attack Trump for not participating in Thursdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate .
He noted Trump was â€œa gentle soulâ€ � who was afraid Megyn Kelly might â€œask him a hard question â€ “ his hair might stand on endâ€ � .
Earlier in the week the Texas senator had challenged Trump to show up at Saturdayâ€ ™ s event for a â€œmano a manoâ€ � debate .
Needless to say Trump did not appear .
But that mild ribbing was the full extent to which Cruz went after his rivals at the event .
Instead Cruz portrayed himself as the true heir to Ronald Reagan and the only committed conservative in the race .
However he struck a far more confrontational tone at a press conference prior to the event .
Speaking to reporters , Cruz went after his two main opponents in brutally direct terms on policy .
â€œA vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for amnesty and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for Obamacare.â€ � All four main candidates are expected to continue campaigning through Sunday before slowly winding up ahead of the caucuses at 7 pm on Monday ."
2016-01-31,"As polling day looms and the cameras turn only toward the contenders to win the Iowa caucuses , at least some around nation canâ€ ™ t help but wonder : what happened to the other guys ?
On the final weekend before the Iowa caucuses , the presidential candidates straggling behind the leaders â€ “ Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for the Republicans , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats â€ “ carried on with brave faces , despite sinking poll numbers and ambivalent voters .
Underdog candidates could , however , have an outsize effect on the campaign : their supporters represent the spread between the leaders .
Sway voters who prefer a third- ( or fourth- or fifth- ) tier contender could bring another candidate closer to the nomination .
For example supporters of the third Democratic candidate , Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley , polling at 3 % in Iowa could ultimately sway the race on Monday .
According to caucus rules , a candidate must have support from 15 % of caucus - goers in any given precinct to reach â€œviabilityâ€ � .
If too few voters support a candidate , they are free to support another .
Both the Clinton and Sanders camps have sought to win over Oâ€ ™ Malley backers .
Nonetheless , on Saturday in Boone , Iowa , the former governor of Maryland told supporters not to waver .
â€œHold strong in that first alignment , â€ � he said .
â€œWe have to beat expectations .
Iâ€ ™ m hoping and working to make my campaign the surprise that comes out of Iowa.â€

Touring the state he won eight years ago , meanwhile , Republican Mike Huckabee projected the aura of a tired heritage act as he spoke to Iowans in small - town clubs and bars .
One part preacher to two parts standup guy , the former Arkansas governor charmed the room at the Inspired Grounds coffee shop in West Des Moines .
But after visiting all 99 counties these past eight months , he is nowhere in the polls .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to be glad
, â€ � he told the gathering , â€œwhen we finally actually base this whole election on votes rather than some east coast pollster who has never spent a night in Iowa , and doesnâ€ ™ t have a clue about voters who are going to be going to the caucuses.â€ �
In the age of Instagram and viral videos , Huckabee spoke up for â€œthe old - fashioned wayâ€ � of electioneering .
â€œHard work and handshakesâ€ �
, he said are the real way to pass your audition for a job at the White House .
There was no policy pitch , except for a moment to hymn the value of lawmaking experience and warn of the danger of appointing as president another untried freshman senator â€ “ a swipe at Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and Rand Paul .
Outside , Gary Leffler , a resident and Huckabee supporter , said the former governor is â€œa man of faith , a man of Godâ€ � , and that â€œyou have to vote on principle and Iâ€ ™ m a principled manâ€ � .
Asked about the long odds of his preferred candidate , Leffler said he would at least vote Republican no matter what .
Huckabeeâ€ ™ s
rival Ben Carson , a retired neurosurgeon whose support in the state peaked at 25 % but has now dropped to 10 % , pledged to voters that he would defy the odds .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re seeing a lot of movement on the ground , thereâ€ ™ s a lot of shifting going on right now , â€ �
Carson told the Detroit News on Friday , in south - east Iowa .
â€œIt almost feels like an earthquake .
And I think a lot of it is shifting in our favor .
So weâ€ ™ re actually looking forward to a very good night , which would be quite surprising , I think , to a lot of pundits.â€ �
Another one - time frontrunner , former Florida governor Jeb Bush , has seen his numbers steadily decline to the point that he found 2 % support in the Register poll â€ “ neck - and - neck with â€œundecidedâ€ � .
In recent days Bush has traveled with his wife Columba and daughter Noelle .
Next month , they will be joined in New Hampshire by their four grandchildren and former president George W Bush .
In Sioux City , he told reporters : â€œThis is a family deal , especially when you get to the beginning of the end.â€ �
Chris Christie , the governor of New Jersey , made the rounds in Iowa , with a stop at the Chrome Horse Saloon in Cedar Rapids .
â€œWhen
you see me in a place like this ,
â€ �
he told the crowd , â€œI become smarter and more charming and better looking and funny .
By the time you walk out of here , you are going to be , â€˜Damn , man , that guy should be emperor.â€ ™ â€ � Christie , the Financial Times reported , cautioned the crowd against supporting Trump , the Republican frontrunner .
â€œShowtime is over , â€ � he said .
â€œWe are not electing the entertainer - in - chief , everybody
â€
¦ we are electing the commander - in - chief .
This isnâ€ ™ t a game .
This isnâ€ ™ t a TV show .
This is the real world.â€ � Carly Fiorina , too , has walked a long road in Iowa , pushing her program to â€œtake our government backâ€ � .
In Mason City , USA Today reported , the former Hewlett - Packard CEO tried to explain her concept of zero - based budgeting .
â€œIt means you can examine any dollar , you can cut any dollar and you can move any dollar .
All the government does now is discuss the rate of increase.â€ �
Senator Rand Paul , too , predicted he will surprise in Mondayâ€ ™ s caucus , arguing that polls are skewed toward older voters , not the younger voters who rally to his pro - liberty positions .
He told NBC on Sunday that his campaign has called â€œa millionâ€ � Iowans : â€œI think weâ€ ™ ve called them so much we know them by name by now.â€ �
And Ohio governor John Kasich , recently endorsed by the New York Times as their editorial boardâ€ ™ s Republican of choice , gave up on Iowa almost completely .
He campaigned in New Hampshire , accompanied by a guitarist , and said he was â€œthrilledâ€ � by the newspaperâ€ ™ s endorsement .
â€œIt really illustrates for a lot of people that Kasichâ€ ™ s a conservative but he has wide appeal , â€ � Kasich told reporters .
â€œHe can get people to come who traditionally donâ€ ™ t go .
And the last guy I can think of who could do that is Ronald Reagan.â€ � Lauren Gambino contributed to this report ."
2016-01-31,"The candidates have set out their final stalls for Iowans before Mondayâ€ ™ s caucus â€ “ the first votes of the 2016 election cycle .
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are polling within the margin of error of each other , and Donald Trump is similarly tied with Ted Cruz .
In a fiery address in Des Moines , Clinton hit out at Sanders on healthcare , and also called for â€œcommon senseâ€ � gun control reform .
Sanders , in his final appeal to Iowa voters , stuck to his stump - speech talking points in front of an enthusiastic audience â€ “
1,700 strong were feeling the Bern .
Trumpâ€ ™ s final rally was in Sioux City , where he appealed to evangelical Christians by appearing in a townhall meeting with televangelist Jerry Falwell , Jr. Federal funding disclosures Sunday night also highlighted some interesting points in the campaign , especially Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s increasingly dismal fundraising and Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s extraordinary hat expenditure .
Also revealed was billionaire George Sorosâ€ ™ $ 6 m donation to the Clinton campaign .
Tomorrow , Iowa goes to caucus .
Weâ€ ™ ll be there with non - stop coverage from across the Hawkeye State â€ “ and jokes !
At Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally at the Iowa State Fair , in a room that is reportedly turning supporters away at the door because itâ€ ™ s over - capacity , a heckler shouts that heâ€
™ s â€œsickâ€ � of the Texas senator .
Sabrina Siddiqui reports from Des Moines , where Hillary Clinton made her final pitch on the eve of the Iowa caucuses to a packed gymnasium of roughly 2,600 people - a crowd that was not only among her largest but also rivaling in its enthusiasm the scene that has become synonymous with a Bernie Sanders rally .
Clinton , facing a second chance at the Democratic nomination , stood before voters in the state that seven years ago handed her a bruising defeat and delivered a resounding speech on the stakes of the presidential election .
Accompanied by her husband Bill and daughter Chelsea , the former secretary of state fashioned herself as a pragmatic progressive with a history of accomplishments to match her soaring rhetoric .
â€œI hope you will caucus for me .
I hope you will fight for me , â€ � Clinton implored .
â€œI will fight for you.â€ � Hours before Clintonâ€ ™ s final rally , hundreds had already formed a line that wrapped around an entire residential neighborhood .
They eventually packed a high school gymnasium , bustling with excitement echoed through their frequent chants of â€œHillary !
Hillary!â€
� and â€œI believe she will
win.â€ �
The positive mood has traveled with Clinton in her final stretch across Iowa , the state that on Monday will begin the first nominating contest of the 2016 race .
Although Clinton remains locked in a competitive battle with Sanders , she holds a slight advantage here over the senator from Vermont .
The crowd cheered her frequently , but reserved its most thunderous reception for when Clinton ticked through priorities that included defending Planned Parenthood and marriage equality , protecting voting rights , and pushing for criminal justice reform and gun control .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a better candidate ,
â€ �
she told them , â€œand , thanks to you , Iâ€ ™ ll be a better president.â€ �
One fascinating tidbit from Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign disclosures - exactly how much the campaign is spending on those famous hats .
He has $ 6.9 m in cash on hand as of the end of 2015 .
A large majority of his campaignâ€ ™ s finance was a $ 10.9 m loan to his campaign from Trump himself .
He also raised just under $ 3 m in donations .
Hillary Clinton finishes her speech in Des Moines .
â€œI will fight for you ,
â€ � she says , in a fiery speech which set out her stall for Iowa voters before tomorrowâ€ ™ s caucuses .
The crowd is getting more and more fired - up in Des Moines for Clinton .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s take on the gun lobby !
Letâ€
™ s stand and vote for common sense , â€ �
she says .
Clinton aiming to put clear water between herself and Sanders on healthcare , saying that she would make Obamacare â€ “ which she says was previously â€œknown as Hillarycareâ€ � work , rather than â€œstart a contentious national debate.â€

Clintonâ€ ™ s livestream on MSNBC just dropped because of â€œtechnical difficultiesâ€ � Two different views on Hillary Clintonâ€
™ s rally tonight , from pollster Frank Luntz and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan :
Edward Helmore and David Taylor have written a delightful run - down of the underdogs going into the primary , who are putting on brave faces despite daunting poll gaps .
Touring the state he won eight years ago , meanwhile , Republican Mike Huckabeeprojected the aura of a tired heritage act as he spoke to Iowans in small - town clubs and bars .
One part preacher to two parts stand - up guy , the former Arkansas governor charmed the room at the Inspired Grounds coffee shop in West Des Moines .
But after visiting all 99 counties these past eight months , he is nowhere in the polls .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to be glad

â€œHard work and handshakesâ€ �
, he said are the real way to pass your audition for a job at the White House .
You can read the whole piece here .
Hillary very fired - up .
She is currently saying she believes we can bring back manufacturing to America - echoing , in an indirect way , what Donald Trump has been saying on the stump , when he talks about making Apple make phones in the US , rather than China .
Clinton , in Des Moines , is leaning heavily on Obamaâ€ ™ s legacy .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think President Obama got the recognition he deserves for making sure
America didnâ€ ™ t fall into another Great Depression , â€ � she says .
Meanwhile in South Carolina , scheduled to primary soon after New Hampshire , Marco Rubio received an extremely important endorsement - from wildly popular congressman and Benghazi committee chair Trey Gowdy , who is currently stumping for him in the state .
â€œBut I also know that over the last days I have people come up to me who still havenâ€ ™ t made up their minds , â€ � Clinton continues .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve had them ask a question , and then have them say they will support me.â€ � â€œI feel so strongly , we canâ€ ™ t afford ot make a mistake ,
â€ � she says .
She asks the audience to think about â€œwhat the Republican candidates are speaking about.â€ �
She says that the American economy is better with a Democrat in the White House .
â€œIn my husbandâ€ ™ s case , it was a recession , the quadrupling of the national debt ... when he got to Washington
, someone said , what do you uniquely bring to Washington ?
He said : arithmetic .
Weâ€ ™ re going to make it add up for everybody.â€ � â€œI am so thrilled to have my husband and my daughter here , â€ � Clinton says .
I am proud to have the support of so many Iowans .
Also as Bill was saying , friends , former colleagues who have come here this weekend because they know whatâ€ ™ s at stake in this election .
The FEC filings for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s super - PAC , Priorities USA Action , are out .
As you might expect , they have a lot of money - $ 35 m cash on hand at the end of December 2015 .
Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign disclosures , however , are not yet released - they are due soon .
Bill and Chelsea Clinton take the stage in Des Moines to introduce Hillary for her final rally before tomorrow .
A fascinating nugget from Rick Santorumâ€ ™ s FEC disclosures spotted by Politicoâ€ ™ s Ken Vogel : the candidate loaned his own campaign $ 24,000 at the end of December last year .
This is particularly poignant because Santorumâ€ ™ s own disclosures , Vogel points out , show him as having negative net worth ...
Hillary Clinton is set to speak soon at Abraham Lincoln High School in Des Moines :
Lest you forget , the long - shot former senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum won Iowa last time around , besting Mitt Romney .
Political reporter Ben Jacobs has this update alongside the reigning champ , filing from Urbandale , Iowa : Just like four year ago , Rick Santorum held his last event before the Iowa caucuses at a Pizza Ranch in suburban Des Moines .
Then , as Santorum was on the verge of a historic upset , he drew a massive crowd that packed the local Iowa chain restaurant .
Groups of reporters were pinned against the salad bar as movement was almost impossible and the candidate had to give two different speeches , one with a bullhorn .
Four years later , the mood was totally different .
This was no campaign rally .
It was a wake .
Santorum filled the party room at a Pizza Ranch just miles from the site of his pre - caucus rally in 2012 â€ “ and only a handful of reporters were present .
The parking lot , though , was filled with Santorum bumper stickers from all over .
These were the loyal supporters : staff members , volunteers , even longtime - mega donor Foster Friess .
These were the people who had been with Santorum since he was at 2 % percent in the polls back in 2011 and stood by him throughout the political roller coaster ride that followed .
They are with him again now , back at 2 % .
In both of his campaigns , Santorum had twice made the retail campaigning mega - tour of visiting each of Iowaâ€ ™ s 99 counties .
In 2012 , it gave him the grassroots support that he needed to win .
In 2016 , Santorumâ€ ™ s long haul means nothing as Ted Cruz usurps his role as the candidate of social conservatives and Donald Trump has swallowed up all the media attention .
Santorum arrived insisting he was going to do a real town hall .
After all , he noted he had performed 700 events like this one in the past five years and was going to end on a strong note .
He maintained confidence that he could somehow pull off another even more improbable upset , noting that 36 % of his supporters made up their mind on caucus night in 2012 and that even more people could still be persuaded this year .
He noted that the undercard debates , all of which he participated in , had demeaned the second - tier polling candidates .
To Santorum , there was a need for â€œserious candidates to be taken seriouslyâ€ � .
He dismissed polls and instead Iowans to â€œvote your convictionsâ€ � .
By the end of Sunday nightâ€ ™ s wake , it became more of a valedictory .
Santorum was made an honorary Pizza Ranch employee .
His campaign chairman noted that he had been to 120 different locations for the restaurant .
He was presented with a Pizza Ranch t - shirt â€ “ a fleece , too .
Santorum told attendees that he liked campaigning in Iowa â€œbeyond measure and I have learned so much from itâ€ � .
He hoped to come back to a Pizza Ranch next time .
â€œWhen
I come in on Air Force One ,
â€ � he joked , â€œthere may not be as many of these types of deals.â€ �
When Trump made his lone appearance at a Pizza Ranch earlier in January , the companyâ€ ™ s CEO Adrie Groeneweg appeared to endorse Trump .
Santorum got the honorary swag from his own campaign staffers .
All the same , Santorum seemed grateful .
He was moved by the presentation , and stayed to take selfies with well - wishers and supporters long after he stopped speaking .
One Pizza Ranch miracle had worked before , he figured ; there was no reason for him to suppose that it couldnâ€ ™ t happen again .
Sanders has just wrapped up his rally at Grand View University in Des Moines .
Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts reports from the scene : Having heard Sanders speak more than 30 times over the last year , I can faithfully report that he did not diverge an inch from his standard stump speech during tonightâ€ ™ s last rally before the Iowa caucus .
Even Bernie is clearly tiring of repeating himself â€ “
â€œLet me say it for the umpteenth time .
I believe healthcare is a right not a privilegeâ€ � â€ “ but even in a room full of his most ardent supporters here in Des Moines , there are still plenty of people hearing it for the first time .
â€œCan you believe , his average donation is just $ 27,â€
� says the guy next to me .
Well , yes , I can actually because he reminds me everywhere I go .
The highly - disciplined messaging strategy appears to be very effective with voters however .
I met another supporter in Waterloo today who had heard Sanders speak three times and said none of it surprised him him any more , he just liked hearing the dreams .
Increasingly many in the audience are beginning to finish the senatorâ€ ™ s sentences .
Iowa campaign co - ordinator Pete Dâ€ ™
Allesandro reminds the crowd
how far they have come : â€œWhen we started this
we had three people , we had no name recognition and no money , and we were 50 points down in the pollsâ€ �
The official crowd count here at Grand View University is 1,700 , but there are many more outside who can not get in .
If , and itâ€ ™ s a big if , this turnout and enthusiasm is matched across the state in caucuses tomorrow , this race is not over yet .
On MSNBC , Hillary Clinton is speaking to Rachel Maddow and Brian Williams over the phone .
Maddow asks if a tactical decision has been taken to keep Martin Oâ€ ™ Malleyâ€ ™ s campaign viable to prevent his supporters defecting to Bernie Sanders .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the first Iâ€ ™ ve heard of that , â€ � Clinton says .
Asked about Sandersâ€ ™ fundraising numbers - he raised $ 20 m in a single month last year - Clinton tells Maddow she isnâ€ ™ t worried .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not only raising money for myself , Iâ€ ™ m raising money to help Democrats up and down the ballot , â€ � she says .
â€œWe will have the resources to compete .
We have a lot of momentum , and Iâ€ ™ m looking forward to the week ahead.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ d thought this was going to be a good contest , and itâ€ ™ s certainly turning into one , â€ �
she adds .
Meanwhile , in Wisconsin , on the eve of the Iowa caucuses , one - time frontrunner and early Trump casualty Scott Walker has found a way to take his mind off the primaries .
Kinda heartbreaking , huh .
FEC disclosure roundup !
Plenty of juicy facts to pick apart as the fourth quarter data comes out of campaign fundraising and spending , and Twitter has been doing just that .
Hereâ€ ™ s a few of the best nuggets : Tick , tock .
Also speaking in Des Moines right now : Chris Christie Clinton is preparing to speak in Des Moines too , and we are on the scene : Among the handful of billionaire donor to have poured millions into pro - Clinton Super Pac Priorities USA Action , is financier and scion of one of the richest families in the US , J. B. Pritzker and his wife , M. K. Pritzker , reports Harry Davies .
Together , the couple gave $ 1.8 m to the group , which pulled in an eye - watering $ 25 m , according to the latest FEC disclosures .
Pritzker , who is one of the heirs to the Hyatt hotel fortune , has a net worth of $ 3.3bn according to Forbes .
He is an influential figure in Chicago , where he runs the private equity and venture capital firm , The Pritzker Group , which contributed to the re - election of Chicago mayor Rahm Emmanuel .
A 2014 Chicago Magazine profile of Pritzker named him : â€œThe Other Mayor of Chicagoâ€ � .
The wealthy investor and philanthropist is the brother of Penny Pritzker , the Obama - appointed Commerce Secretary and fellow multibillionaire , who is known to use her personal Gulfstream private jet for official business .
The Rubio campaign says they received over 93,000 donations from all 50 states and raised over $ 5 million online .
The Rubio campaign says they received over 93,000 donations from all 50 states and raised over $ 5 million online , Sabrina reports .
Ben Jacobs is listening to Rick Santorum speak in a restaurant in Urbandale , Iowa , where the former senator was introduced by Chuck Grassley : Santorum won Iowa in 2012 in an upset that surprised pretty much everyone - can he pull off the same coup this time ?
According to the polling , probably not ; but stranger things have happened .
â€œIowans have a unique role to play in the presidential process , and they take taht responsibility very seriously , â€ � the Vermont senator says .
The live feed is still down - the guy is currently complaining that the government has purposefully damaged infrastructure in this country .
But Dan is on the scene , so weâ€ ™ ll have a more detailed report for you soon .
In the meantime , Sanders appears to be campaigning on the dating app Tinder , so you can catch him there : Iowa is set for a snowstorm tomorrow , according to weather reports .
Caucuses begin at 7PM central time , roughly at the same time as the National Weather Service has issued blizzard watch warnings for across much of the state , with parts of Iowa forecast six to 18 inches of snow .
Whether this will have an effect on caucus turnout is difficult to say , but itâ€ ™ s going to get pretty snowy in the Hawkeye state tomorrow evening .
Itâ€ ™ s interesting to compare the venues of Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s rallies in Iowa this evening .
Sanders is in Des Moines : Clinton will speak at Abraham Lincoln high school in Des Moines , in what looks to be a considerably more modest space : More Google data here ; these live - updated charts show search interest in candidates across the state of Iowa right now :
Trump is on the phone with MSNBCâ€ ™ s
Joe Scarborough right now , absolutely slamming Ted Cruz , his main rival in the polls in the first caucus state .
Itâ€ ™ s interesting , in Canada , he said he did nt know he was a Canadian citizen ... said he didnâ€ ™ t know about his loan from Goldman Sachs .
This guy is a lying guy , heâ€ ™ s hated by everyone .
Canâ€
™ t get the endorsement from the governor of Texas ...
[ he is running ] ads that are unbelievably untrue .
Bernie Sanders is about to speak at a rally in Waterloo , Iowa right now , and Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts is on the scene .
Dan reports that organisers at the last Bernie Sanders rally before caucus night are focused heavily on reminding the audience where to go and what to do tomorrow night .
â€œStand in the corner with the Bernie stuff , get there early and have fun , â€ � one young volunteer tells the enthusiastic crowd at Grand View University in Des Moines .
Crucially she reminds them of an often forgotten feature of a campaign that has so many students on its side : â€œIf you are 17 but old enough to vote in the general election in November , you can caucus.â€ � â€œDonâ€
™ t forget to bring a friend , or two ... or everyone you know , â€ �
she adds .
Others are blunter still .
â€œSay no to the big shots , the bastards and the bullshitters , â€ � urges progressive radio host Jim Hightower .
Another key supporter , national nurses union leader RoseAnn DeMoro , has harsh words for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s attempt to suggest Sanders wants to â€œdismantleâ€ � Obamacare health reforms .
â€œWhat is disgraceful is another candidate is telling us that guaranteed , universal health care â€˜will never ,
ever happenâ€ ™ ,â€ � saiys DeMoro .
â€œFor nurses , turning your back on suffering is the worst crime you can commit.â€ �
There is little love lost between the two , especially after Clinton attack chief David Brock accused DeMoro of breaking Sandersâ€ ™ rule not to use Super Pacsin his campaign .
â€œWe are not a Super Pac ,
â€ � an indignant DeMoro tells The Guardian .
â€œThis is ordinary members contributing dues and we use that money to engage nurses in the campaign ..
Itâ€ ™ s an independent expenditure PAC and itâ€ ™
s not just for Bernie , itâ€ ™ s how we do our political work.â€
�
The feed for Sandersâ€ ™ event is cutting in and out - an announcer is saying â€œthis is [ because of ] the privatisation of your internet , privatisation of your bandwidth.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s here , when itâ€ ™ s running : 23 hours and 45 minutes , to be precise , until the voting goes down in the Hawkeye state .
But whoâ€ ™ s counting ?
By contrast , Rick Santorumâ€ ™ s FEC disclosure data shows that at the end of last year the former senator had just $ 42k cash on hand at the end of the year , on total fundraising of just $ 245,555 .
The Texas senator raised $ 20.5 m in the last quarter of 2015 , giving him a formidable $ 19 m cash on hand at the and of the year â€ “ nearly half of his total fundraising in this election cycle was in the last three months of the year .
Compare that to the $ 15 m quarter for Jeb ( ! )
Bush , thought to be the epitome of a big - money election , and you can start to see why Cruz is cruising into Iowa caucus day , nipping at the heels of Trump with a high - powered campaign machine .
Weâ€ ™ ve still yet to get all the reports from outside donors to Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign â€
“ heâ€
™ s got a whole troupe of super - Pacs â€ “ but stay tuned , as weâ€ ™ ll be breaking them down when they come in ahead of the midnight Federal Election Commission deadline .
Part of the reason Trump is reaching out to evangelicals is that polling sees him neck - and - neck in Iowa with Ted Cruz , who is popular on the Christian right .
Cruz is also in church today :
In the fourth quarter of last year , New Jersey governor Chris Christie consolidated his small but effective fundraising operation , raising nearly $ 3 m , giving him $ 1 m cash on hand , reports the Washington Post .
Christieâ€ ™ s haul of $ 2.95 million in the final three months of the year brings the total raised for his campaign to $ 7.16 million .
Although that amount puts him far behind Republican fundraising leaders including Sen. Ted Cruz ( Tex . ) , Christie has kept his operation relatively lean and his advisers stressed that he has avoided some of the budget pitfalls of such rivals as former Florida governor Jeb Bush .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve done a lot more with a lot less , â€ � said Mike DuHaime , Christieâ€ ™ s chief strategist .
â€œWe havenâ€ ™ t had any of the problems that other campaigns had with spending .
â€
¦ Weâ€ ™ ve been smart and judicious.â€ �

Donald Trump is in Sioux City , Iowa , closing out his caucus campaign in an event with the televangenist Jerry Falwell .
Heâ€
™ s just donated $ 100k on stage to a charity which supports injured veterans .
Trump appears to have found God in snowy Iowa .
This is the real - estate mogulâ€ ™ s second event today which is aimed to reach out to evangelical Christians in the state ; earlier today , Trump and his wife Melania joined pastor Joshua Nink at his church in Council Bluffs , Iowa , for a Sunday morning service .
Governor John Kasich of Ohio talked terrorism with a 12-year - old and danced around a pointed question about American exceptionalism during a town hall in Bow , New Hampshire , reports Lauren Gambino : The young girl stood up and began her question but the governor interrupted .
â€œHow old are you?â€ �
â€œTwelve , â€ �
she replied as if irritated that adults always ask this .
Kasich asked he to wait while he waved over a staffer and instructed him to take a photo .
â€œVoters like these moments
, â€ � he said half - jokingly as an aside to the adults in the room .
He then let her finish .
She asked what he was going to do about the terrorists who keep killing Americans .
â€œDo
you worry about that?â€ �
he asked , â€œI donâ€
™ t want you to worry about that.â€ �
He the proceeded to tell her about the bad guys in Pakistan ( â€œDo you know what Pakistan is ?
Itâ€ ™ s a country who donâ€ ™ t like young girls to go to schoolâ€ � ) .
He also explained that there was a team of specialists dedicated to keeping Americans safe .
That team is called a â€œbig long wordâ€ � : the Joint Terrorism Task Force .
After starting on a story about a terrorist attack at a girls school in Pakistan , Kasich decided to try another tack .
â€œSo what do you want to be when you grow up?â€ �
Later in the event he was asked if believed America really is better than every country , and what message that sends to world leaders .
Kasich answered with a football metaphor .
â€œDo
you know Tom Brady? ...
Everybody on [ the Patriots ] recognizes that he is the leader .
That doesnâ€
™ t mean the rest of the players on the team
shouldnâ€ ™ t
be respected.â€
�
He added later :
â€œItâ€ ™ s not arrogance , itâ€ ™ s leadership.â€

Kasich ended the event with one final pitch from the heart : â€œGimmie the vote , would ya?â€ �
Hedge fund billionaire Julian Robertson , one of Jeb !
Bushâ€ ™ s most generous donors , is hedging his bets with donations to Ohio governor John Kasich , FEC disclosures looked at by Politico reveal .
Robertson gave $ 25,000 to New Day Independent Media Committee , one of the twin groups backing the Ohio governor , according to disclosures filed Sunday .
Last June , Robertson , who founded Tiger Management , gave $ 1 million to Right to Rise , the pro - Bush super PAC .
Right to Rise hadnâ€ ™ t filed its latest disclosure report as of Sunday evening , so it was unclear whether Robertson continued to support Bushâ€ ™ s cause in the last part of 2015 .
You can read the whole story here ; but even in the last couple of minutes , Right to Rise filed its latest disclosure , showing that it had raised a dismal $ 15 m in the second half of the year , as compared with $ 103 m in the first half of the year .
Thatâ€ ™ s an unbelievably precipitous dropping - off in funding ; no wonder the former Florida governor has looked so glum recently .
In Des Moines on Saturday , US head of news David Taylor was given a tour of what has to be Americaâ€ ™ s most patriotic tractor .
The 1957 860 Ford , complete with hologram eagle whose eyes follow passersby , the names of military veterans and â€œJesus in the cloudsâ€ � , is the creation of Gary Leffler of West Des Moines .
As Mondayâ€ ™ s Iowa caucus approached , Leffler was sticking to his support for former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , an underdog in this race but a politician with a strong evangelical following who won the state in 2008 .
â€œUnderneath
the hood of the tractor is all the names of our family that served in the military , â€ �
Leffler said as he conducted a tour of the vehicle , noting that his son had just been promoted to captain and would thus need to have his title on the tractor updated .
The top of the hood features a Bible verse , John 3:16 , and a cross , Leffler said ,
â€œand if you look in the clouds right here you can see Jesus in the clouds.â€

but it seems he has far more prosaic tastes in food , Ben Jacobs reports from Council Bluffs , IA :
In a rally this afternoon in a middle school gym , Trump supporter Jerry Falwell Jr revealed his surprise yesterday when he discovered that the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s dinner last night was â€œa lot of Wendyâ€ ™ s cheeseburgers.â€
�
The meal which Trump shared with Falwell and others happened on Trumpâ€ ™ s luxurious plane as they crisscrossed the Hawkeye State .
Trumpâ€ ™ s rally was otherwise quite low key as it took place an interview format with Falwell offered Trump softball questions about his campaign .
Trump used the opportunity to attack Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign for a controversial mailer which hit mailboxes in Iowa this week .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a social thing ,
youâ€ ™ re not allowed to do that , â€ � said the mailing , which tried to shame Iowans into caucusing by sharing their voter histories .
Trump also warned â€œpretty soon youâ€ ™ re going to have illegals start to vote.â€ �
Only United States citizens can currently vote in elections and non - citizens , both in the country legally and illegally can not participate .
Billionaire George Soros officially has skin in the game .
New FEC donation disclosure info has revealed today that on December 17 , he gave a $ 6 m to Priorities USA Action ,
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s super - PAC .
According to Michael Beckel , a reporter for the Center for Public Integrity , this means that five â€œmegadonorsâ€ � account for 40 percent of the $ 41 m raised by Priorities in 2015 - Haim and Cheryl Saban , Herb Sandler , Donald Sussman and Soros .
Good evening .
Iâ€ ™ m Nicky Woolf , and Iâ€ ™ ll be your guide through the final snowy spring toward Iowa caucus day , which â€ “ after months of bluster and billions of dollars
â€ “ is finally upon us .
On Monday , the first votes are to be cast in the 2016 presidential election race .
On the Democrat side , Hillary Clinton â€ “ who launched her presidential bid nine and a half months ago and drove straight to the Iowa city of Des Moines â€ “ faces off against Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley .
On the Republican side , the last big poll out of Iowa put Donald Trump and Ted Cruz almost neck - and - neck for support , chased by what is still a crowded field of candidates including Marco Rubio , Ben Carson and , somewhere down there tied with the answer for â€œundecidedâ€ � , poor ole Jeb ( ! )
Bush .
On the ground for you in the Hawkeye state , at this very moment , as snow falls from the sky , we have our mighty political reporting squad : Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts is on the ground and on the bus with Team Sanders .
Political reporter Sabrina Siddiqui will soon be meeting up with all three Clintons : Hillary , Bill and Chelsea .
( Maybe even a Royal Baby ? )
Guardian US head of news David Taylor has been following around the likes of Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz ,
whoâ€ ™ s got several events weâ€ ™ ll be tracking tonight .
Political reporter Ben Jacobs will be by their side .
Somewhere in there is West Coast bureau chief Paul Lewis , who has been shooting pheasants with Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s sons , and Guardian editor - at - large Gary Younge ,
who ...
well , this video he took the other day should put you in the mood for one helluva Sunday :
Weâ€ ™ ve got Trump , Cruz , Clinton and Sanders
all set to speak this evening , and the FEC deadline for big - money donations to finally be disclosed coming straight on till at midnight tonight .
Oh , and national reporter Lauren Gambino is with John Kasich on the trail in New Hampshire , because primary day there is only a week - and - change away , too .
Buckle up folks : election day is finally on the horizon .
Itâ€ ™ s going to be a bumpy ride .
A new CNN / WMUR poll , conducted by the University of New Hampshire puts Bernie Sanders a full 23 points ahead of Hillary Clinton in the second state to vote in the 2016 , 57 % to 34 % .
Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley barely registers on the Democratic side , with only 1 % .
The poll is actually a decline for Sanders since the most previous survey , but still a remarkable margin for the senator from Vermont .
For Republicans , Donald Trump leads the new poll 30 % to Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s 12 % .
Marco Rubio is a close third at 11 % , followed by John Kasich ( 9 % ) , Chris Christie ( 8 % ) and Jeb BVush ( 6 % ) .
In Des Moines , David Taylor gets a tour of the worldâ€ ™ s most patriotic tractor : a 1957 860 Ford â€ ¦ complete with hologram eagle whose eyes follow passersby , the names of military veterans , and â€œJesus in the cloudsâ€ � .
â€œMy wife says , â€˜Really ?

As polling day looms and the media focuses on the contenders to win the Iowa caucuses â€ “ Trump , Cruz and Rubio for the Republicans , Clinton and Sanders for the Democrats
â€ “ a nation finds itself wondering : what have the stragglers been up to ?
At least one reporterâ€ ™ s keeping track
â€ “ Edward Helmore is on the case : On Saturday , New Jersey governor Chris Christie was making one of two stops in the state at the Chrome Horse Saloon in Cedar Rapids .
He paused to inform the crowd : When you see me in a place like this â€
¦
I become smarter and more charming and better looking and funny .
By the time you walk out of here , you are going to be , â€˜Damn , man , that guy should be emperor.â€ ™ Christie , the Financial Times reported , cautioned the crowd against supporting the Republican frontrunner , Trump .
â€œShowtime is over , â€ � he said .
â€œWe are not electing the entertainer in chief , everybody
â€
¦ we are electing the commander - in - chief .
This isnâ€ ™ t a game .
This isnâ€ ™ t a TV show .
This is the real world.â€
�
The third Democratic candidate , Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley , polling at 3 % in Iowa , remains important because that support represents the spread between Clinton and Sanders .
According to the rules of caucusing , a candidate must have support from 15 % of caucus - goers in any given precinct to reach â€œviabilityâ€ � .
If too few voters support a candidate , they are free to support another .
Both the Clinton and Sanders camps have therefore sought to win over Oâ€ ™ Malley backers .
Nonetheless , the former Maryland governor told supporters in Boone on Saturday : Hold strong in that first alignment .
We have to beat expectations .
Iâ€ ™ m hoping and working to make my campaign the surprise that comes out of Iowa .
Back in the Republican field Ben Carson , whose support in the state peaked at 25 % but has now dropped to 10 % , has pledged to defy the odds .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re seeing a lot of movement on the ground , thereâ€ ™ s a lot of shifting going on right now , â€ �
Carson told the Detroit News on Friday , in southeast Iowa .
It almost feels like an earthquake .
And I think a lot of it is shifting in our favor .
So weâ€ ™ re actually looking forward to a very good night , which would be quite surprising , I think , to a lot of pundits .
Referring to recent media coverage that has focused on campaign stumbles and raised the possibility Iowa could mark a last stand for his campaign , Carson told the crowd , â€œIf I listened to what the media said about me , Iâ€ ™ d run in the other direction.â€ � Carly Fiorina , too , has been walking a long road in Iowa , pushing her program to â€œtake our government backâ€ � .
In Mason City in the northern part of the state on Saturday , USA Today reported , the former Hewlett - Packard CEO sought to explain the concept of zero - based budgeting .
It means you can examine any dollar , you can cut any dollar and you can move any dollar .
All the government does now is discuss the rate of increase .
Senator Rand Paul , too , predicts he will surprise in Mondayâ€ ™ s caucus , arguing that polls are skewed toward older voters , not younger voters who rally to his pro - liberty positions .
He told NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press on Sunday his campaign has called a million voters in the state .
â€œI think weâ€ ™ ve called them so much we know them by name by now , â€ � he said .
Onetime frontrunner Jeb Bush , meanwhile , has seen his numbers steadily decline to the point that he took 2 % support in the Register poll .
In recent days , he has been travelling with his wife Colomba and daughter Noelle .
Next month , the Bushes will be joined in New Hampshire by their four grandchildren and former president George W Bush .
In Sioux City , the candidate told reporters : This is a family deal , especially when you get to the beginning of the end .
â€œHe may have won eight years ago in Iowa , but Mike Huckabee has the aura of a tired heritage act on one last tour of small town clubs and bars.â€ � David Taylor , head of news for the Guardian US , reports from West Des Moines
: One part preacher to two parts stand - up guy , the former Arkansas governor can still charm a room .
But after visiting all 99 counties as a virtually permanent resident in Iowa these past eight months , he is nowhere in the polls .
With 30 hours to go until the caucus , he had an answer for an early afternoon crowd forced into the back room of the Inspired Grounds coffee shop .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to be glad when we finally actually base this whole election on votes rather than some east coast pollster who has never spent a night in Iowa , and doesnâ€ ™ t have a clue about voters who are going to be going to the caucuses.â€
�
At the back , a little girl drew a picture of the candidate and decorated it with stars and the legend â€œHuck â€˜16â€ � .
A woman in her 60s nibbled her way through a beautifully - risen apple caramel crumb cake while the veteran candidate listed the welders and single moms he had met , the police officers and the factory workers who stand all day on concrete floors .
In the age of Instagram and viral videos , Huckabee spoke up for â€œthe old fashioned wayâ€ � of electioneering .
â€œHard work and handshakesâ€ �
, he said are the real way to pass your audition for a job at the White House .
There was no policy pitch , except for a moment to hymn the value of lawmaking experience and warn of the danger of appointing as president another untried freshman senator â€ “ a swipe at Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and Rand Paul .
Huckabee is widely tipped to be the next Republican to drop out of the race , but the sunny optimist was still dreaming of an upset and looking forward to Iowans waking up on Tuesday saying : â€œOh
my , he done did it again.â€
�
But he may simply be done .
The latest FEC filings have been trickling in .
By midnight , campaigns and Super Pacs must disclose where theyâ€ ™ ve been getting their money and how theyâ€ ™ ve been spending it for period covering July to the end of the year .
Early disclosures show the newest of the pro - Cruz Super Pacs , Stand for Truth , has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from opaque limited liability companies ( LLCs ) , which have little or no information about who owns the company or the companyâ€ ™ s business activities .
While LLCs are not unusual and perfectly legitimate entities , they can be less transparent than a corporation depending on the state in which they are incorporated .
LLCs often have fewer requirements to disclose financial information and ownership .
The involvement of LLCs in campaign finance has previously raised the alarm among transparency groups over so - called â€œdark moneyâ€ � entering politics .
The Sunlight Foundation says LLCs can â€œbecome efficient and useful vectors for concealed political donations.â€ �
Altogether , Stand for Truth received $ 380,000 from eight LLCs in December , less than a month after the group was established .
One of these LLCs appears to be incorporated in Delaware where information on companies is so limited they are â€œessentially black boxesâ€ � , as the Center for Public Integrity puts it .
Over the past two months , Stand for Truth has poured over $ 4.7 m into TV , digital and radio advertising to support Cruz .
As part of an expensive ad surge in Iowa , the Super Pac launched an attack ad against Donald Trump , in which the rival candidate can be heard saying : â€œIn many cases , I identify more as a Democrat.â€ � Ohio Governor John Kasich is hoping to make a splash here in Salem , New Hampshire , with a little help from his friends .
On a sunny winterâ€ ™ s day , Kasich opened his 85th New Hampshire town hall on Sunday by asking a bearded troubadour to play the Beatlesâ€ ™
Here Comes the Sun .
Rod Webber , known locally as the â€œflowermanâ€ � because he hands candidates flowers for peace , strummed his guitar .
â€œHere comes the sun , â€ � he sang , slightly off - tune .
â€œGlobal warmingâ€ � .
The audience chuckled politely and Kasich jumped in : â€œYou might want to work on your vocals.â€ �
While the rest of the Republican presidential field blankets Iowa for any last - minute votes , Kasich wooed moderate Republicans and independent voters here in New Hampshire with his folksy charm and sunny message .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a lot more interested in talking about what Iâ€ ™ m for than the people who are in the primary up here in New Hampshire because you know what I want to raise the bar .
I want us to regain hope in this country , â€ � Kasich said .
The audience erupted in applause .
Kasich said outside his event in Salem that heâ€ ™ s â€œthrilledâ€ � to have received the endorsement of the New York Times and the Boston Globe , as well as the backing of seven out of eight of New Hampshireâ€ ™ s newspaper editorial boards .
â€œIt really illustrates for a lot of people that Kasichâ€ ™ s a conservative but he has wide - appeal , â€ � Kasich told reporters .
â€œHe can get people to come who traditionally donâ€ ™ t go .
And the last guy I can think of who could do that is
Ronald Reagan.â€ �
Guardian US head of news David Taylor is in Iowa .
As well as filming Vampire Weekend and Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ surprise rendition of This Land is Your Land , he has been taking photographs around the campaign trail .

Following the news from the Bernie Sanders campaign about raising $ 20 m in January , almost entirely from small online contributions of $ 27 , some news from the other end of the donor scale , which is also where many candidates at the other end of the political spectrum are often to be found .
Conservative Solutions raised more than $ 30 m last year for Marco Rubio , half of it in the last six months of 2015 .
The Super Pac shared the figure â€ “ not actually especially large for Super Pacs and in fact smaller than the sum raised by Sanders in the last quarter of 2015 â€ “ before Sundayâ€ ™ s FEC filing deadline .
The names of the big Rubio donors , however , are telling .
Among them were Paul Singer , the billionaire New York investor who backed Rubio officially in October ( $ 2.5 m ) and Ken Griffin , an investor from Chicago who announced support for the Florida senator in December ( $ 2.5 m ) .
Other seven - figure contributors included Florida car dealer Norman Braman , New York financier Cliff Asness and roofing executive David Humphreys , from Missouri .
Unlike donations to campaigns , donations to Super Pacs are not limited .
Hereâ€ ™ s a list of them , which points out that more of them are conservative than liberal .
Conservative Solutions , which like any other Super Pac is not allowed to co - ordinate with the Rubio campaign , said it began 2016 with $ 14 m left to spend .
Apropos of nothing in particular , some further reading : Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s wife , Melania , made an unusual campaign stop in Iowa on Sunday , at a school gymnasium in Clinton Bluffs , Iowa .
The Republican frontrunner , who has built a campaign on an anti - immigration platform , introduced his Slovenian wife as his â€œbest pollsterâ€ � for predicting he would win .
As she walked on stage there were wolf whistles and shouts of â€œOh
yeahâ€
� .
â€œHello , Iowa it is great to be here ,
â€ �
she said a thick , Eastern European accent .
â€œHe will be unbelievable , the best deal maker , the best master negotiator.â€
�
â€œThank
you honey ,
â€ �
Trump replied .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s so nice.â€
� Ted Cruz found himself at the center of controversy this weekend after his campaign distributed mailers that accused Iowa voters and their neighbors , by name , of committing a â€œviolationâ€ � by not turning up to previous caucuses .
A mailer issued by Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign also hit mailboxes this weekend , although it did not single out voters in the same way .
Though fashioned as a â€œVoting Report Cardâ€ � , Rubioâ€ ™ s mailers were also different from Cruzâ€ ™ s in that they pointed out that a voter did not participate in previous elections but did not provide a letter grade .
They also did not look like an official record â€ “ an issue that earned Cruz a rebuke from Iowaâ€ ™ s Republican secretary of state , who said the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign had misrepresented the role of his office .
The Cruz mailer read :
â€œELECTION
ALERT : VOTER VIOLATIONâ€
� , â€œPUBLIC RECORDâ€ � and â€œFURTHER ACTION NEEDEDâ€
� .
The Rubio mailer read :
â€œ , 7 of your neighbors are voting in the Iowa Caucus on Monday , February 1st .
Are you?â€
�
On Saturday , Rubio criticized his Senate colleague by saying that voters who approached him had been â€œupsetâ€ � and â€œdisturbedâ€ � over such tactics by the Texanâ€ ™ s campaign .
Later in the day , Cruz refused to apologize for what he said was simply an effort to boost voter turnout .
The two men also traded blows â€ “ largely over immigration â€ “ on the Sunday talk shows .
In the Des Moines Register poll released on Saturday night â€ “ and seen as a gold standard for predicting the caucus winners â€ “ Cruz was second to Donald Trump , on 23 % to 28 % for the real - estate mogul .
Rubio was third with 15 % , with some observers saying his campaign shows signs of building serious momentum .
The Bernie Sanders campaign has just announced it raised $ 20 m in January , almost entirely from small online contributions of $ 27 .
The campaign has received a record 3.25 million individual contributions , more than any other candidate for the president .
The Sanders campaign raised almost $ 33.6 m in the fourth quarter of 2015 , it said , with 70 % coming from contributions of $ 200 or less .
Sandersâ€ ™ campaign has now surpassed the huge funds raised by Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s campaign in the first quarter of 2008 , before he defeated Hillary Clinton in the primary election .
In a press release , the campaign contrasted Sandersâ€ ™ small funders with the major backers of Clinton , who led him by three points in the final poll before the Iowa caucuses .
Citing Federal Election Commission reports , the campaign noted that three of every five dollars given to Clinton came from people who have already given her the maximum $ 2,700 .
â€œAs
Secretary Clinton holds high - dollar fundraisers with the nationâ€ ™ s financial elite , â€ �
Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said , â€œworking Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled.â€
�
The campaign also boasted , somewhat disingenuously , that Sanders â€œhas refused to coordinate with a Super Pacâ€ � â€ “ technically no candidate is allowed to coordinate with such organizations , which can raise unlimited funds on behalf of a preferred campaign or party .
Super Pacs have ballooned in the wake of the supreme courtâ€ ™ s 2010 Citizens United decision , which Sanders has decried as evidence of the corrupting influence of money in politics .
Clinton and most of the Republican candidates have Super Pacs acting on their behalf , one of which says it raised $ 25 m for the former secretary of state in 2015 , and $ 50 m so far .
Sanders has made Clintonâ€ ™ s complicated relationship with Wall Street a primary if sometimes veiled line of attack , highlighting the large paychecks she received from banks for speaking .
Clinton has not yet reported how much money her campaign raised in the fourth quarter of 2015 .
The former secretary of state took a break from he campaign trail in Iowa and New Hampshire this month to attend a fundraiser in Philadelphia , alongside singer Jon Bon Jovi and finance executives .
The price of breakfast at the closed press event ranged from $ 250 to the maximum contribution of $ 2,700 .
With less than 12 more hours to go before thereâ€ ™ s only about 20 hours to Iowans caucusing madly across the Hawkeye state , hereâ€ ™ s a quick summary of developments in the raceâ€ ¦
The Republicans Donald Trump leads Ted Cruz by five points in the final poll of the stateâ€ ™ s primary , and had nothing but unkind words for the Texas senator on Sunday .
â€œTed Cruz is a total liar , â€ � he told ABC .
â€œAll of these senators , not one endorsement of Cruz because heâ€ ™ s
a nasty guy.â€ �
But the billionaire also said he doesnâ€ ™ t care if he loses over his support for providing healthcare to poor Americans .
â€œI have a heart .
I want people taken care of.â€ �
He also defended his formerly good relations with the Clinton family , saying that when youâ€ ™ re a â€œworld - class businessmanâ€ � youâ€ ™ ve got to be nice .
Cruz accused Trump of making a mistake by choosing not to debate last week , but mostly went after Florida senator Marco Rubio , who is gaining from third place in the polls .
The Texas senator then delivered a series of less - than - factual remarks about Syrian refugees and â€œamnestyâ€ � for undocumented people .
Rubio also called Cruz a liar , and said his congressional colleague was at least as into immigration reform back when everybody thought it was cool .
â€œHe helped design George W Bushâ€ ™ s immigration policy , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œAt the end of this election heâ€ ™
s just making things up.â€
�
The Democrats â€œHillary Clinton will be the problem , â€ �
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders told NBC .
Sanders argued that itâ€ ™ s all about turnout , and that Clinton wonâ€ ™ t be able to muster a very enthusiastic revolution in the general election .
â€œOur campaign is the campaign that is generating excitement and energy that will result in a high voter turnout , â€ �
he said .
â€œRepublicans win when voter turnout is low .
Democrats win when voter turnout is high.â€ � Sanders , fresh off a singalong of This Land Is Your Land with some 5,000 people and the band Vampire Weekend , trailed Clinton in the final Iowa poll by three points .
Clinton took umbrage with the idea that she is not the candidate for the middle class , and responded to a Guardian op - ed by former labor secretary Robert Reich by saying her campaign will draw in people who feel left out â€ “ if not immediately .
The former secretary of state also answered questions about whether she compromised classified information by using a private email server .
â€œThere is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me , â€ � she said .
Just release the emails , she told the FBI and State Department , by way of the TV .
Elsewhere â€œMaybeâ€ � candidate Michael Bloomberg , the billionaire and former mayor of New York , will not be celebrating poll results that show quite a lot of Republican and Democratic voters
donâ€ ™ t know who he is , and quite a lot of those
who do donâ€ ™ t like him .
My colleagues Lauren Gambino and Bastien Inzaurraulde met with some artists who bought a Trump campaign bus and have turned it into an anti - Trump campaign bus .
They want to make fruit punch great again .
And Paul Lewis , the Guardianâ€ ™ s west coast bureau chief , went pheasant hunting with Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s sons .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if Iâ€ ™ ll do it on video , â€ � the Donaldâ€ ™ s progeny told a reporter ,
â€œor youâ€ ™ ll turn me into some sort of mass butcher.â€ � Pizza Ranch .
Jeb gear .
Two minutes of vaguely operatic Americana music that ends with a fadeout of Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s face .
Theyâ€ ™ re just throwing it all at Iowa and seeing what sticks .
More from Edward Helmoreâ€ ™ s stint watching Fox News Sunday , which featured a rare person identifiable as neither candidate nor pundit .
Long - time Republican Iowa governor Terry Branstad indicated he would be happy with any Republican candidate except Ted Cruz , whose refusal to support ethanol and wind energy subsidies has angered businessmen in the state .
â€œWe want to grow those jobs , â€ � Branstad said .
On NBC , Cruz was asked about the ethanol issue â€ “ an issue , as it happens , which is explained very nicely by Ben Jacobs here .
Hereâ€ ™ s the exchange : Cruz : â€œâ€ ¦ the people who are attacking me on this are lobbyists and Democrats .
And the reason theyâ€ ™ re attacking â€ “ Chuck Todd : â€œTerry Branstad , is he a lobbyist or a Democrat?â€ � Ted Cruz : â€œNo , his son is a lobbyist who makes hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying on ethanol .
So his family makes a ton of money.â€ � Branstadâ€ ™ s son , Eric , is â€œhead of Americaâ€ ™ s Renewable Future , a bipartisan coalition of Iowa ethanol supporters who back the renewable fuel standard ( RFS)â€ � .
This also from Ben : â€œIn a statement , Branstad said : â€œUntil Cruz pledges to uphold the RFS as the law dictates â€ “ not his position to phase it down by 2022 â€ “ we will continue to educate Iowa voters about his bad position.â€ �
This from Cruz on NBC :
And the lobbyists very much want to keep Iowa focused on the ethanol mandate , because it keeps Iowa dependent on Washington .
It means every year , theyâ€ ™ ve got to go back to Washington and maintain the mandate .
The lobbyists get paid , the politicians get paid .
Iâ€ ™ m going to eliminate all the subsidies .
No subsidies for oil and gas , no subsidies for anybody â€ ¦ [ continues for some time ]
So itâ€ ™ s not an oil thing .
Itâ€ ™ s a Washington - insider - cartel thing , of the kind Cruz regularly rails against .
Either way , being seen as no friend of ethanol isnâ€ ™ t particularly good for oneâ€ ™ s chances in Iowa .
Of course , a lot of other people have a lot of other reasons not to support Ted Cruz .
And now a tour of a Trump campaign bus turned anti - Trump campaign bus , as filmed by Bastien Inzaurralde for the Guardian .
This time he was speaking to Fox News Sunday , which Edward Helmore was watchingâ€
¦ With 29 % of likely Republican caucus goers
In Iowa saying they disapproved of Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to skip the Fox debate last week , the candidate said he had no regrets : You have to stick up for your rights .
You ca nt let people do that .
We raised $ 6 m for the vets .
It was great decision and Iâ€ ™ m happy about it .
Trump rejected accusations leveled by Ted Cruz that he skipped the debate to hide his liberal voting record and defended past contributions to the Clinton Foundation that records suggest reached as much as $ 250,000 .
Trump said he understood the Clintons were engaged with reconstruction in Haiti , not renting private aircraft .
â€œI was a businessman and it was my obligation to get along with everyone , â€ �
he said .
He also welcomed polls that suggest 52 % of white evangelicals believe he could be a â€œgood or great presidentâ€
�
â€ “ good news for a candidate who has been dogged by questions about his faith â€ “ or perceived lack of it .
â€œIâ€ ™ m more honored by that than even my lead in the polls , â€ � he said .
â€œWe have a great relationship .
Itâ€ ™ s a turning point .
Iâ€ ™ m a Christian .
Iâ€ ™ m very happy about that.â€ �
Trump also said he would look favourably on efforts to return decision - making on same - sex marriage to individual states .
Sanders makes a quick appearance on NBC , and Chuck Todd questions the senator sharply on his healthcare - and - taxes proposal .
He airs a clip of Clinton suggesting that Sandersâ€ ™ plan is a fantasy â€œthatâ€ ™ s never going to happenâ€ � .
Sanders answers : â€œletâ€ ™ s just look at the facts.â€
�
The facts are that we are spending far more than other countries on healthcare .
My proposal will save middle class families thousands of dollars a year on their healthcare costs .
Most people tell me , yes , they would be happy to pay $ 1,000 more in taxes if theyâ€ ™ re paying $ 5,000 less in healthcare premiums .
So you know , this is an issue where we have got to control healthcare costs , guarantee healthcare to all people , and do what every other major country on earth is doing .
We have got to take on the drug companies who are ripping us off and the private insurance companies .
Todd brings up a comment by House minority leader Nancy Pelosi that suggests she doesnâ€ ™ t want Sanders as the Democratic nominee .
â€œAnd you donâ€
™ t think youâ€ ™ re going to be a problem for House Democrats who donâ€ ™ t want to run on raising taxes?â€ � â€œNo ,
â€ �
Sanders says .
â€œI think in fact , Hillary Clinton will be the problem.â€
�
He says it comes down to the way voter turnout can swing a national election : Because I think our campaign is the campaign that is generating excitement and energy that will result in a high voter turnout .
Republicans win when voter turnout is low .
Democrats win when voter turnout is high .
I think our campaign is raising issue about a rigged economy , a corrupt campaign finance system .
Marco Rubio takes an interview on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press , where host Chuck Todd asks him about comments he made in 2006 regarding Floridaâ€ ™ s willingness to embrace cap - and - trade emissions regulation .
â€œI do not support big mandates , â€ � Rubio says .
He argues that he was always against it but worried at the time that federal regulation would come down to the states .
â€œIf they
[ mandate regulation ] we have to be prepared to comply , â€ � he tells Todd .
â€œYou
didnâ€
™ t play the full clip.â€ �
Rubio says Republicans and Democrats can indeed get along sometimes : â€œI do think
thereâ€
™ s a bipartisan way , â€ � he says , using student loan debt as an example .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a chance to work together and you donâ€ ™ t have to betray your principles , you work together.â€
�
Finally Todd talks up Rubioâ€ ™ s decent poll numbers and ( paraphrasing here ) says : Youâ€ ™ re popular .
People find you favorable .
Why arenâ€ ™ t you winning ?
Rubio answers by saying he just plans to win â€œmore delegates than anyone elseâ€ � , even though the road may be long and dark .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think youâ€ ™ re really going to get clarity in this race for a while.â€ � Mitt
Romney â€ “ remember him
â€ “ has been doing jokes again .
This , with ( appropriate terminology alert ) a hat - tip to the hallowed Politico Playbook email from Mike Allen , is from Romneyâ€ ™ s speech to the 103rd Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington DC on Saturday night :
Some have speculated that my religion might have played a part in my defeat .
I wondered about that myself , but most of my wives said they didnâ€
™ t think soâ€
¦ There are six words Hillary hopes to hear a year from now : â€˜Place your hand on the Bible.â€ ™
The five words she FEARS
sheâ€ ™ ll hear a year from now :
â€˜Will the defendant please rise?â€ ™ ...
Bernie Sanders ... looks like one of those 1960s folksingers who does specials on PBS during pledge week .
I will say this about a Sanders presidency : I will sleep better at night knowing Peter , Paul and Mary are running the government .
What is the Alfalfa Club , you ask ?
Something that sounds an appropriate setting for a Monopoly board - esque , Gilded Age - throwback billionaire who uses words like â€œvarmintsâ€
� , I say .
In all seriousness , according to the Washington Post the Alfalfa Club is â€œa secretive private club that meets just once a year , has no official purpose , and is named after a plant that will do almost anything for a drinkâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s elite , it was founded in 1913â€ ¦ and again according to the Post â€œitâ€ ™ s a cross - section of power brokers so influential that almost every president has made a pilgrimage to the annual gatheringâ€ � .
Obama has , duly , addressed it .
Ah , democracy .
Next Sanders tells Stephanopoulos he â€œwonâ€ ™ t politicizeâ€ � questions about whether Clinton may have compromised classified information by using a private email server while secretary of state .
He repeats what he said on CNN : that thereâ€ ™ s
â€œa legal processâ€ � going on and he doesnâ€
™ t want to get into it .
He concludes by saying heâ€ ™ s great friends with Barack Obama and Joe Biden , and that he wants to build on their legacy .
The ABC host asks Sanders about the New York Timesâ€ ™ endorsement of Clinton , and its description of his ideas as too extreme to work .
I respond to it by saying that every proposal I am bringing forth is in fact supported by the vast majority of the American people .
The problem is that Congress is so dominated by big money interests they are much more concerned about campaign contributions than they are about [ the middle class ] .
â€œThese are not radical ideas , George , â€ �
he says , mentioning tax hikes for the wealthiest , healthcare reform , lowering education costs and several other plans .
He concedes itâ€ ™ s â€œa fair questionâ€ � to ask how effectively the government can take on drug companies and Wall Street .
But he wonâ€ ™ t be daunted , he continues .
â€œDemocrats win elections when large number of people vote .
Thatâ€ ™ s what Obama did in 2008 and thatâ€ ™ s what we can do now .
Republicans win elections when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low.â€ � Bernie Sanders is up next .
Stephanopoulos asks whether the pundits who say he doesnâ€ ™ t have a chance are going to look stupid on Tuesday morning .
â€œI truly hope so ,
George , â€ � he says .
He repeats a variation of what he said earlier this morning on CNN : Almost 70,000 people in the state of Iowa , and I think if working people , and lower income people , and younger people
â€ ¦ Weâ€ ™ re going to win this thing and pull off one of the great political upsets in recent history .
When we began this campaign we were trailing Hillary Clinton by 50 or 60 points .
He says that while he knew his key issues â€ “ â€œthe decline of the middle class , of billionaires being able to buy elections while kids arenâ€ ™ t able to [ afford ] collegeâ€ � â€ “ would resonate , heâ€ ™ s been surprised by the enthusiasm for his campaign .
Back when he launched his campaign last year , he says , â€œI did not believe it would resonate quite as fast as it
has.â€ �
Stephanopoulos then asks Clinton about an op - ed in the Guardian
( Hey , thatâ€ ™ s us !
He didnâ€ ™ t mention us though ) by Robert Reich , the Berkeley professor and former secretary of labor .
In his op - ed , Reich called Sanders the nominee America needs to combat inequality : Hillary Clinton ?
I have worked closely with her and have nothing but respect for her .
In my view , sheâ€ ™ s clearly the most qualified candidate for president of the political system we now have .
But the political system we now have is profoundly broken .
Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have because heâ€ ™ s leading a political movement for change .
Clinton gives by far her most charged answer of the interview , arguing that as the campaign grows sheâ€ ™ ll bring in more people who feel like theyâ€ ™ re on the fringes of society .
She says her Senate campaign eventually won over people , â€œthen when I was secretary of state even the Republicans said I was doing a good jobâ€ � .
I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody , particularly hard working middle class families who rightly feel theyâ€ ™ ve been left out and left behind .
You can check out Reichâ€ ™ s full piece through the link below : Edward Helmore has been watching Ted Cruz on Fox News Sunday , so you donâ€
™ t have to .
Thereien , among the usual variations on a theme , Cruz responds to Trumpâ€ ™ s barbs about his financial situation : Donald looks rattled .
That why heâ€ ™ s insulting me everyday .
Itâ€ ™ s the height of chutzpah .
For someone who owes billions of dollars , going after [ Cruzâ€ ™ s wife ] Heidi and I for putting our net worth into the campaign is the height of dishonesty.â€ �
Then we get some succinct sketching of the respective campaignsâ€ ™ positions , as seen from Camp Cruz :
A vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for amnesty ; a vote for Trump is a vote for Obamacare ; and a vote for Ted Cruz is a vote for a true conservative â€ ¦ the stakes are too high to take a risk .
Clinton similarly answers cautiously when asked about attack ads against Bernie Sanders , who has been accused of being weak on gun control and reproductive rights .
Sanders notes that he has a D - minus rating from the NRA and a 100 % voting record in support of Planned Parenthood .
Clinton says sheâ€ ™ s just proud that the pro - gun control Brady Campaign and Planned Parenthood have chosen to endorse her â€ “ leaving their non - endorsement of Sanders implicit .
â€œI feel vetted , â€ �
she says , â€œI feel ready , I feel strong and I think Iâ€ ™ m the best person to be the nominee and to beat whoever the nominate in November.â€ � Hillary Clinton , the Democratic frontrunner , is next on ABC with Stephanopoulos .
He asks about her emails .
She says : Hereâ€ ™ s what I know .
This is I think a continuation of the story thatâ€ ™ s been playing out for months .
There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me .
Senator Dianne Feinstein , according to Clinton , â€œhas said this email chain did not originate with me and that there are no classification
markingsâ€
� .
She says wants the emails out .
â€œI
just want this matter resolved , the best way to resolve is to do what I asked months ago , â€ � she says , â€œto release the emails ,
let the public see , and move on.â€
�
â€œI take classified information very seriously .
You canâ€
™ t take information off the classified system onto the unclassified system , no matter what that
is.â€ �
But she doesnâ€ ™ t want to say outright that the emails are being used a political ploy :
â€œIâ€ ™ m gon na leave that to others who are quite experienced in the ways of Washington to comment on.â€
�
She does say , however , that â€œthis is very much like Benghazi , Georgeâ€ �
â€ “ something that Republicans will use to try to hurt her chances in the election .
This post exists entirely to point you in the direction of this entirely splendid piece and video by Lauren Gambino and Bastien Inzaurralde , in which the intrepid pair speak to some artists who bought Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s old â€œparty busâ€ � and turned it to their own , not particularly Trump - friendly uses .
This quote seems apposite : The bus used to be used as a party bus and the Trump campaign leased it from them , but they never removed the stripper pole , â€ � said Mary Mihelic , an artist who is part of the anti - Trump bus project .
â€œSo weâ€ ™ re kind of using that as kind of a metaphor for Trump .
The piece is here and the video is here .
And hereâ€ ™ s a picture of said bus : Stephanopoulos : So if you donâ€ ™ t support Obamacare or a singlepayer system , as Cruz alleges , whatâ€ ™ s your plan for a healthcare system ?
Trump : â€œI have a heart .
I want people taken care of.â€
� If people have no money we have to help people , but that doesnâ€ ™ t mean singlepayer â€ ¦
If somebody has no money and theyâ€ ™ re lying in the middle of the street â€ ¦ weâ€ ™ re gon na work with our hospitals , weâ€ ™ re gon na work with our doctors , weâ€ ™ re gon na do something.â€
�
The billionaire waxes compassionate : â€œJust
because theyâ€ ™ re down and out â€ ¦
so they end up dying ?
Weâ€
™ ll work something out .
If this means I lose an election
thatâ€ ™ s fine
because frankly we have to take care of the people in our election , we ca nt let them die on the sidewalks of New York or of Iowa .
That said , he maintains the country must â€œrepeal and replace Obamacare , itâ€ ™ s a disaster , the premiums are going up.â€
�
Could you still lose ?
â€œWell , you never know , itâ€ ™ s an election ,
â€ �
Trump says with surprising humility .
â€œI
never thought Iâ€ ™
d have 24-point leads in different states â€
¦
I never thought
Iâ€ ™ d have the kind of leads in New Hampshire.â€ � The Texas senatorâ€ ™ s accusations that Trump supports Obamacare are nonsense , the billionaire says .
â€œTed Cruz is a total liar , â€ �
Trump tells Stephanopoulos .
â€œIâ€
™ m gon na repeal and replace Obamacare
, I donâ€ ™ t
even know where he gets this.â€ �
He didnâ€
™ t even put down on his financial disclosure forms that he â€
¦ Heâ€
™ s got these favorable deals from banks on Wall Street â€
¦
This is why nobody likes him â€ ¦
This is why he doesnâ€ ™ t have one endorsement
â€ ¦
He works with these senators and doesnâ€ ™ t have one endorsements .
Trump is alluding to loans that Cruz failed to disclose as required by campaign finance rules .
The billionaire says that Trump takes direction â€œfrom the oilmen and other special interests â€ ¦
He is 100 % in their pockets heâ€ ™ s going to do whatever they want him to do.â€ �
Have any senators endorsed you , Stephanopoulos asks ?
They will be very soon â€ ¦ by the way we have tremendous endorsements .
Jerry Falwell Jr from Liberty University â€ ¦
Sarah Palin just endorsed me â€ ¦ Sheriff Joe from Arizona â€ ¦ the toughest Arizona border just endorsed me .
Stephanopoulos raises Trumpâ€ ™ s former chumminess with Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton .
â€œWell
you know you need a dealmaker too ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œAs far as Hillary Clinton is concerned when I was in business
I was a world class
businessman.â€ �
Frankly when I was in business I got along with everybody
â€
¦ I happen to have a conservative way of thought â€
¦ but when youâ€ ™ re a businessman you have to get along with everybody
â€
¦ even worldwide
I get along with everybody .
Cruz , on the other hand :
â€œall of these senators not one endorsement of Cruz because heâ€ ™ s a nasty guyâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s on to ABCâ€
™ s This Week with George Stephanopoulos , who talks about the prominent supporters of Hillary Clinton ( husband Bill , daughter Chelsea ) , Bernie Sanders ( indie band Vampire Weekend ) , and Ted Cruz ( a bearded , bandannaâ€ ™
d fellow from Duck Dynasty ) .
â€œIowa Democrats love Bill Clinton , â€ � a reporter tells Stephanopoulos , who last year disclosed donations totalling $ 75,000 to the Clinton Foundation .
Donald Trump phones in .
â€œThey say the more people that get out the better I do , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œThe blizzard is supposed to be on Tuesday â€
¦
They think record attendance will happen.â€
�
He says itâ€ ™ s great â€œhow well Iâ€ ™ m doing with evangelicals , Iâ€ ™ m leading with Tea Party , Iâ€ ™ m doing great in every aspect throughout the nation â€ ¦
Hard to believe we begin in one day!â€
�
The former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg , who is reportedly weighing an independent presidential bid , will not be celebrating the results of a survey conducted in Iowa by his namesake firm .
The final Bloomberg Politics / Des Moines Register Iowa Poll was released with much fanfare on Saturday night , mostly because of what it said about the caucus chances of Trump , Cruz , Clinton and Sanders .
Alas , for Bloomberg , it also found 41 % of likely Republican caucus - goers and 57 % of likely Democratic caucus - goers do not know the financial data billionaire well enough to share an opinion about him .
For those who do know him , half of Republicans polled and a quarter of Democrats said they held an unfavorable opinion , placing Bloomberg with higher negatives than any other 2016 political name except Jeb Bush and Sarah Palin .
But while Rubio has criticism for Cruz heâ€ ™ s dismissive of Trump â€ ¦ and the stakes of Iowa .
â€œDonaldâ€ ™ s the greatest show on earth ,
itâ€ ™ s very entertaining , â€ � he says .
Then the senator plays up his electability in the general election : â€œif we get this election wrong there may be no turning back on some of theseâ€ � issues , he says .
At the same time the chaos of the 2016 campaign season has clearly gotten to him .
â€œNo one is unbeatable , â€ � Rubio says , calling the primary a â€œvery unusual yearâ€ � .
â€œThis election is not going to be decided by one or two states , â€ � he says ,
adding that he thinks the primary will take â€œlonger than [ the ] usual process , given the size of the field and given the challenges for the country.â€ �
He brings it back around to the general election and his chances against a Democrat , spinning the CNN interview into a stump speech to Republicans .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not going to turn this country around if a socialist like Bernie Sanders or someone like Hillary Clinton is elected president.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s some more video of the Vampire Weekend - Bernie Sanders

Or , a lot of snow .

itâ€ ™ s good .
Vermont icons Ben and Jerry are yearninâ€ ™ to vote Bern in , and telling Lauren Gambino both why that should be , and why their new Bernie - themed ice cream is a perfect metaphor for the class struggle .
And now Tapper has apparated into Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign bus , where the Florida senator is wearing a monogrammed UnderArmor fleece .
He likes football .
The CNN host immediately asks about Cruzâ€ ™ s accusations of flip - flopping on immigration .
Rubio says Cruz lying : â€œThe lie that his whole campaign is built on is that
heâ€
™ s
the only conservative and everyone else is a sellout.â€ � â€œHe helped design George W Bushâ€ ™ s immigration policy , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œAt the end of this election heâ€ ™
s just making things up
â€
¦ heâ€
™ s obviously spooked by something
so we expect the kitchen sink here in the next 48 hours.â€ �
He adds that as president he would undo Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions .
Cruz continues to bash Rubio : â€œIf youâ€ ™ re asking who can I trust to do what he said , the fact that on his signature issue Marco broke his trust .
â€œThat would be like my coming to Washington and suddenly discovering I was for Obamacare.â€ �
And then he segues into stump speech mode .
If we nominate a candidate who supports amnesty , the same position â€ ¦ the same millions of Reagan democrats , of steel workers and autoworkers and truck drivers â€ ¦ weâ€ ™ ve got to be fighting for the working men and omen of this country â€ ¦ weâ€ ™ ve got to be on behalf of the men But Rubio , Cruz says â€œled the fight for amnesty and Ted Cruz led the fight against itâ€ � .
He sideswipes Trump .
â€œDuring that whole battle Donald Trump was nowhere to be found.â€
�
Cruz ends by saying that when Trump skipped the Fox debate this week , it showed he â€œwasnâ€ ™ t willing to submit to the scrutiny , and I think thatâ€ ™ s a mistake.â€ � â€œHe canâ€ ™ t defend his substantive record , â€ � Cruz says , saying Trump is in line with Bernie Sanders on healthcare .
His position on cronyism and corporate welfare is the same as Barack Obama â€ ¦
He supported Obamaâ€ ™ s stimulus he [ thought ] it shouldâ€ ™ ve been larger â€ ¦
I get that it is unpleasant to have your record subject to scrutiny â€
¦
but this is a job interview .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s ideas are fair game , if not his personality , according to Cruz .
He and I have very , very different views on questions like life and marriage and religious liberty â€ ¦ healthcare and amnesty
â€
¦
I think the people of Iowa deserve more
and I think the American people deserve more than just a battle of petty insults .
He moves on to criticize Florida senator Marco Rubio , who has risen in the polls against Cruz in the last few weeks .
Cruz says Rubio failed voters on immigration .
â€œThe central question of this primary is trust â€ ¦
they donâ€
™ t do what they say .
If you look at when Marco and I both ran â€ ¦
I promised the men and women of Texas
I would lead the fight against amnesty .
â€
¦
But when we got to Washington he and I made very , very different decision .
Cruz lumps Rubio together with Democrats â€ “ Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid and Barack Obama â€ “ and blames the Florida senator for supporting â€œtens of thousands of Syrian refugees without mandating any background
checksâ€ � and granting â€œamnesty to 12 million people illegallyâ€ � .
The senator , alas , is not exactly correct .
The US has accepted only about 2,500 Syrian refugees ( with background checks so extensive they stretch across 18 - 24 months ) .
Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions do not grant â€œamnestyâ€ � ; he has sought to protect some undocumented people from deportation but millions are unshielded , and his second set of actions are going before the supreme court .
The Obama administration also continues to target families for deportation , especially those who have fled from Central America .
Next up for CNN is Texas senator Ted Cruz , whoâ€ ™ s on a bus with Tapper and second to Donald Trump in the Republican primary .
Cruz downplays his fall in the polls to Trump .
We are competing hard â€ ¦ weâ€ ™ re competing hard in the ground in New Hampshire , in South Carolina and Nevada â€ ¦ all across Super Tuesday .
We donâ€
™ t view any state as a must - win .
I think weâ€ ™ re positioned to do very well in Iowa .
Tapper asks about Trump himself and the acrimony between the candidates .
( Trump called Cruz â€œan anchor baby in Canadaâ€ � last week , an allusion to the dual American - Canadian citizenship that Cruz only renounced after he became a senator . ) â€œThereâ€ ™ s a phase to every campaign , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œA month ago Donald was telling everyone how much he liked me.â€
�
He says Trump has good insults though .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll give him credit that when he insults someone itâ€ ™ s always memorable and colorful.â€ �
But he wonâ€ ™ t fire back , apparently .
â€œNo matter what he says I like Donald .
I will continue to praise him as bold and fresh.â€ �
The interview was recorded before his campaign was called out for this : CBS taped their interview with Donald Trump on Friday , 24 hours or so before the Des Moines Register poll which has defined this final weekend before the caucuses , partly by putting The Donald five points ahead of the man who we shall refer to here as The Cruzer .
The interview is broadcasting later this morning
but there are , in the way of such things , excerpts bouncing around the ether .
Hereâ€ ™ s one :
â€
¦ I do have , actually , much more humility than a lot of people would think .
Presumably thatâ€ ™ s also much more humility than anyone else ever in the history of humility .
Huge humility , probably .
Yoooge .
In the CBS interview , Trump also says â€œnone of the other guys will winâ€ � .
Of course he does .
Finally , Tapper asks Sanders about foreign policy and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s use of a private email server â€ “ and 22 emails deemed too classified for public release by an investigation into that server .
On the first question , Sanders harks back to his vote against the invasion of Iraq , calling it â€œthe most important foreign policy issue in our lifetime or at least in the last 20 to 30 yearsâ€ � .
He says heâ€ ™ s confident he can â€œprevent our young men and women in the military from getting involved in perpetual warfareâ€ � .
He can build a coalition to resolve crises in the Middle East , he says .
As for the emails , â€œthere is a legal process taking place .
I do not want to poltiicize that issue .
It is not my style .
â€œWhat I am focusing on , Jake , are the issues impacting the middle class of this country.â€ �
Sanders adds that heâ€ ™ s all for new debates with Clinton , and would gladly go to the struggling town of Flint , Michigan .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s do it before their primaries .
Iâ€ ™ ve always wanted more debates.â€
�
â€œGod knows whatâ€ ™ s going on in Flint , Michigan , â€ � he says of the city , where lead - tainted water has afflicted citizens for nearly two years .
Sanders has called for Rick Snyder , the Republican governor of Michigan , to resign .
Tapper asks why Sanders now has secret service protection after months of campaigning without it .
The senator says security is â€œsomething we should not talk aboutâ€ � .
So Tapper asks about a scathing Washington Post editorial instead .
â€œI am not greatly beloved by the economic establishment , â€ � Sanders says , â€œor by the major media of this countryâ€
�
I am being attacked because
Iâ€ ™ m too ambitious , because I say among other things maybe we should have a tax on
Wall Street speculation â€
¦
and maybe we should use that money to make colleges and university tuition free â€ ¦ maybe we should use that revenue to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure .
The Washington Post is the establishment , doesnâ€ ™ t surprise me they donâ€ ™ t like my ideas .
Tapper asks Sanders about ads produced by the Clinton campaign and its allies .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t keep up with what the Clinton campaign does , â€ � Sanders says .
He mentions accusations â€œfor example that I am attacking Planned Parenthoodâ€ � , which he says is crazy .
He says heâ€ ™ s always supported the reproductive rights group : â€œOne of the great organizations in America .
So I donâ€
™ t know what the Clinton campaign is doing ,
all I know is we are bringing out large numbers of people , we are creating
excitement.â€ � Sanders says Americans â€œare tired of seeing all this new income and wealth â€ ¦ want us to address climate change , want us to address a broken criminal justice system .
So Iâ€ ™ m feeling good , Jake .
â€œIf people come out to vote
I think you are looking at one of the biggest political upsets in modern history.â€ �
Bernie Sanders is on CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union with Jake Tapper , who asks how he expects to overcome Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s narrow lead in the polls .
We were 50 or 60 points behind Secretary Clinton , and the reason for that is we have 15,000 volunteers
â€ ¦ Theyâ€ ™ re going to be urging people to come out in very large numbers to vote â€ ¦ who previously were not involved in politics .
He says Iowa could be â€œthe first state in the country to lead us in a very , very different directionâ€ � .
Iowa is about to choose the first two winners of the 2016 election â€ “ and weâ€ ™ re covering the countdown live , with Guardian reporters following the campaigns on the trail as candidates make their last , sometimes desperate pitches to the people who could help elect one of them to the White House .
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had a good night on Saturday : each rose to the top of the final Des Moines Register poll , considered the gold standard for predicting how Iowa will caucus .
Trump led Texas senator Ted Cruz by five points in the poll , and Clinton led Vermont senator Bernie Sanders by three .
Sanders and Clinton tentatively agreed to four more debates .
Sanders hosted a huge , raucous rally that culminated in an emotional rendition of the folk classic
This Land Is Your Land , led by the senator and backed by an indie rock band and thousands of people .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not bad to be just a little bit behindâ€ � in the polls , his campaign manager said .
The Cruz campaign resorted to telling Iowans they risked â€œvoting violationsâ€ � if they did not go to the polls .
State officials promptly denounced the campaign and the senator was denounced by officials for shaming residents , but Cruz didnâ€ ™ t back down .
He also enjoyed a rambling endorsement from Glenn Beck .
Florida senator Marco Rubio drew big crowds and kept up a counter - attack against Cruz , hoping for a third - place finish that could set up him for the next primary state , New Hampshire .
Clinton campaigned alongside her husband Bill , drawing a voluble crowd of about 1,000 .
â€œI am a progressive that actually likes to make progress .
That is what I believe in , â€ � she said .
â€œWhat we need is a plan and a commitment.â€ � Jeb Bush , the former Florida governor , son and brother of presidents and , once upon a time , the presumed Republican nominee , landed at 2 % in the DMR poll .
And west coast bureau chief Paul Lewis went pheasant hunting with Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s sons .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if Iâ€ ™ ll do it on video , â€ �
DJT Jr told a reporter , â€œor youâ€ ™ ll turn me into some sort of mass butcher.â€ �
Weâ€ ™ ll watch the talk shows so you donâ€
™ t have to , and bring all the news from the final mad dash to win Iowa ."
2016-02-01,"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , the two Republican candidates each vying to prove themselves the most viable alternative to Donald Trump , have been locked in a heated battle over immigration in the run - up to the Iowa caucuses on Monday night .
Speaking to the Guardian as voting in the key state was about to begin , Rubio maintained that his record on immigration had been clear whereas Cruz , he said , had misled the American public .
â€œTed Cruz presents and portrays himself as this purist whoâ€ ™ s never supported anything that even comes close to legalization [ for undocumented immigrants ] when in fact he did
, â€ � the Florida senator said after a town hall in Cedar Rapids on Sunday .
â€œHe helped design George W Bushâ€ ™ s legalization policy as a candidate , he openly and repeatedly talked about reaching a compromise on people that are here illegally â€
¦
He said he wanted to see immigration reform pass , he wanted to see people come out of the shadows .
And now heâ€ ™ s pretending that that never happened and it did .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not about immigration .
Itâ€ ™ s about the calculation that he thinks he can say and do anything and people arenâ€ ™ t going to notice , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubio did not enter the final stretch of the Iowa caucus at the top of the polls , but nonetheless his rivals felt sufficiently threatened to spend at least $ 20 m on ads attacking him â€ “ largely focused on his record on immigration .
At present he stands third in polling behind Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump in Iowa , and third in the national Republican race .
Cruzâ€ ™ s closing argument across Iowa drew heavily on Rubioâ€ ™ s support in 2013 for a comprehensive bill to make the case that â€œa vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for amnestyâ€ � .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been clear , â€ �
Rubio told the Guardian .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t think we can fix this comprehensively , Iâ€ ™ ve been very clear about that .
That was tried .
It failed , for good reason , because Americans donâ€ ™ t trust the federal government and weâ€ ™ re going to have to do this in stages beginning with enforcement.â€ � Immigration has been at the forefront of the Republican primary , spurred by a grassroots anger that has helped send Trump and Cruz to the top of the polls .
The Texas senator has adopted an especially hardline position , shifting his stance on work permits for foreign workers and birthright citizenship .
While he maintains he never supported legalization for undocumented immigrants , and was simply using procedural tactics to derail Rubioâ€ ™ s bill in 2013 , it was not until December that Cruz explicitly ruled out providing the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US with a path to legal status .
In last weekâ€ ™ s Republican debate , Cruz sought to once more shift the focus back toward Rubioâ€ ™ s prior efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform .
He was joined , somewhat unexpectedly , by former Florida governor Jeb Bush â€ “ who charged that Rubio â€œcut and ranâ€ � from his own bill when faced with resistance from conservatives .
Asked by the Guardian to respond to the criticism , Rubio said his legislation â€ “ known as the â€œGang of Eightâ€ � after the bipartisan group of senators who worked on it
â€ “ was no longer relevant .
â€œThe bill has no chance of passing .
There is no support for a path that does not first involve bringing illegal immigration under control .
Period , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œAnyone who continues to insist , like Jeb does , that it needs to be done comprehensively and through one massive piece of legislation is not being realistic .
Theyâ€ ™ re not being serious about it .
â€œThere is no way to solve this issue until first we bring illegal immigration under control and prove to the American people that itâ€ ™ s under control , â€ � he added .
Voters have nonetheless taken notice of the barrage of attack ads against Rubio , particularly some that recycle clips of him advocating a path to citizenship during the 2013 debate .
At town halls here over the past week , there were several instances in which potential caucus - goers said they were confused about where , precisely , he now stood on so - called â€œamnestyâ€ � .
Rubio pushed back emphatically , insisting he has never been , and will never be , for â€œblanket amnestyâ€ � .
He also drew on his roots , as the son of Cuban immigrants and from a predominantly immigrant community in West Miami , to cast himself as speaking with particular authority on the issue .
â€œAs the son and grandson of immigrants , I can say that enforcing immigration laws is not
anti - immigrant , â€ �
he told the hundreds who packed his town halls and rallies throughout Iowa .
As for his current position , Rubio has said he continues to support eventually providing green cards to law - abiding undocumented immigrants â€ “ only after the border is secure , legal immigration is reformed , and after they first receive work permits for 10 years .
He has also reframed the immigration debate as one of national security , pointing to the threat posed by the Islamic State and the potential infiltration of terrorists across US borders .
As president , Rubio told the Guardian , his plan for undocumented immigrants would be shaped by the will of the American public , a debate he emphasized would only occur once illegal immigration was under control .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think the American people are going to support anything until border security is first in place .
After that , weâ€ ™ ll see what people are willing to support , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve outlined a way forward .
Weâ€ ™ ll see if people support it .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to force it on them.â€ �"
2016-02-01,"Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s presidential campaign has ramped up its aggressive voter - targeting operation , paying out more than $ 3 m to a company that â€ “ along with parallel funding via Super Pacs linked to the senatorâ€ ™ s top donor â€ “ is using detailed psychological profiles to sway voters .
A Guardian analysis of the final campaign disclosures released on the eve of Iowaâ€ ™ s caucuses shows the Cruz campaign , banking on a win in the first - in - the - nation voting state , significantly outspent his main Republican rivals in targeting potential voters online during the final quarter of 2015 .
During this period , Cruz surged in the polls and emerged as a frontrunner from the crowded Republican race in Iowa as attack ads rained down on Donald Trump and Marco Rubio .
Trump went on to regain his lead ahead of Monday nightâ€ ™ s Iowa caucuses .
Over the weekend , the Cruz campaign came under fire separately for mailing accusations of a â€œvoting violationâ€ � to individual Iowa residents amid what privacy and transparency experts said had amounted to â€œa military escalationâ€ � of data - driven campaigning .
The federally mandated release of expenditure filings on Sunday shows a crescendo of spending as well - funded campaigns and their allied Super Pacs bolster their digital firepower by pouring record amounts of cash into the so - called â€œmicro - targetingâ€ � of voters across social media with increasingly personal ads .
Cruz has deepened his ties to the little - known data analytics firm , Cambridge Analytica , directing around 20 % of overall spending during the reporting period to the data scientists embedded at Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign headquarters in Houston .
In December , the Guardian uncovered long - standing privacy and ethical issues around the way Cambridge Analyticaâ€ ™ s parent company had acquired detailed psychological data on tens of millions of voters using data harvested from largely unwitting Facebook users .
Cambridge Analytica is understood to be financed by hedge - fund magnate Robert Mercer , who is also the leading individual donor to the Cruz campaign .
Last year , the influential but reclusive Wall Street executive channeled $ 11 m into the pro - Cruz Super Pac Keep the Promise I.
The Mercer - backed group is part of a cluster of pro - Cruz Super Pacs , which all use a variation of the name Keep the Promise .
In recent weeks Cambridge Analytica appears to have played a key role in a digital advertising blitzkrieg , funded by the web of Super Pacs that support Cruz .
According to so - called â€œindependent expenditureâ€ � reports , the Mercer - backed group , Keep the Promise I , has paid out almost $ 350,000 to Cambridge Analytica since mid - November .
The records state the firm provided unspecified â€œmediaâ€ � in order to support Cruz and attack rival candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump .
While the Keep the Promise Super Pacs officially exist as separate entities , the groups work together and keep in touch with weekly strategy calls , according to the Washington Post .
In the two weeks leading up to the Iowa caucus , the Super Pacs spent $ 1.1 m on online campaigning and advertising .
The involvement with Cambridge Analytica by both the Cruz campaign and an allied Super Pac appears to contrast with a decision made by Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s campaign last year to halt plans which would have seen the candidate share a data analytics company with the pro - Bush group , Right to Rise .
In October , the Associated Press reported the Bush campaign halted the plan over concerns around potentially crossing the line of coordination .
Even after the 2010 US supreme court decision that allowed unlimited outside funding , candidatesâ€ ™ campaigns and Super Pacs are prohibited from coordinating political activities and must maintain separate operations .
Richard Skinner , a policy analyst at transparency watchdog the Sunlight Foundation , said shared vendors are traditionally one of the â€œred flagsâ€
� when detecting coordination between a campaign and an outside group .
Asked to examine the relationships stemming from Cruzâ€ ™ s data - centric operations , Skinner said the campaign and Super Pac are not simply sharing a company that manufacturers campaign T - shirts , but a company that is providing an essential service to both .
â€œThe data is clearly pretty central to the campaign and presumably central to what the Super Pac is doing , â€ �
Skinner said in a phone interview on Monday , adding that Mercer had taken an â€œunusually active role for a major donorâ€ � in Cruz campaign operations .
In an email , Cambridge Analyticaâ€ ™ s CEO Alexander Nix said his company treats compliance with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) rules as an â€œutmost priorityâ€ � .
He added : â€œWith this in mind we have strict fire - walling procedures in place wherein the staff , data , and systems for each campaign are physically and electronically separated.â€ �
A spokesman for Mercer did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Big data , bigger spending on Trump hats The latest federal disclosures suggest the Cruz campaign is relying heavily on Cambridge Analytica as a pillar of his campaign operation , spending $ 3,055,990.95 from October through December .
â€œWe have a very successful relationship , â€ �
Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told the Guardian in December , adding that information was acquired legally .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re a great company , they provide us great data , and it helps us be highly effective in communicating with our voters.â€ �
( Tyler and a campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article . )
So far , other Republican candidates have spent considerably less on comparable data firms and digital - focused political consultants .
Of the $ 1.3 m Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign spent during the final quarter of 2015 on digital campaigning â€ “ or what on the campaign trail is known as â€œdigital , data and analyticsâ€ � â€ “
the largest sum of around $ 460,000 went to Optimus Consulting , a relatively small data analytics firm which has an established relationship with the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s campaign .
Meanwhile , Trump spent more on hats than he did on data analytics .
In early November , his campaign paid $ 235,000 to L2 Political , a minor Washington - based voter targeting and analytics outfit which focuses on political clients .
Overall , Bushâ€ ™ s campaign spent around $ 800,000 on the digital campaign trail , over half of which went to Deep Root Analytics , a firm co - founded by former Mitt Romney data scientist Alex Lundry , who also serves as the Bush campaignâ€ ™ s director of analytics .
â€˜Violationsâ€
™ â€ “ and a war for targeting In the final hours ahead of the 2016 campaignâ€ ™ s first vote , which was set to begin in Iowa on Monday evening , the Cruz campaign was condemned from all sides for applying its newfound targeting prowess to old - fashioned voter outreach .
On Friday , it emerged the campaign had sent official - looking direct mail to some voters accusing them of a â€œvoting violationâ€ � .
The mailer , which did not involve Cambridge Analytica , used so - called â€œsocial pressureâ€ � techniques and calculated a fake score for each target voter , along with their neighbors , according to their participation in recent elections .
Responding to the controversy on Saturday night , Cruz was bullish .
â€œI apologize to nobody for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote , â€ � he told a press conference in Sioux City .
Experts in modern - day election outreach said the mail episode , taken together with big - money online profiling , showed the Cruz campaignâ€ ™ s expertise in using psychological methods to pressure individuals into voting .
David Peterson , a professor of political science at Iowa State University , appreciated that Cruz is trying to run a â€œsmart and advancedâ€ � campaign by drawing on psychological techniques and academic research , but claimed the mailer had crossed a line .
â€œWe know candidates and campaigns mislead people all the time about themselves and their opponents , â€ � he said .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s the misleading about private citizens who have no connection to any of this that strikes me as particularly galling , and thatâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s a step too far.â€
�
In recent years , a wide body of academic research has found â€œsocial pressureâ€ � is often highly effective in increasing turnout â€ “ the key blockage in the senatorâ€ ™ s path to overtaking Trumpâ€ ™ s poll lead at the caucuses .
â€œJust by gently signalling that people are watching you has been shown to increase participation , â€ � said Eitan Hersh , a political scientist at Yale University who focuses on voter attitudes and campaign strategy .
Joseph Turow , a leading data privacy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania , said that as the 2016 primary votes arrived , political analysts had seen an â€œupward trajectoryâ€ � in data - driven campaigns targeting voters across devices and in specific moments .
â€œEssentially itâ€ ™ s a military escalation because every group and every competitor is trying to outdo the other , â€ �
he said in an interview ahead of Sundayâ€ ™ s federally mandated filings ."
2016-02-01,"The US military commander in charge of the Iraq - Syria war has tacitly rebuked pledges by leading Republican presidential contenders to â€œcarpet - bombâ€ � the Islamic State .
Though army Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland did not call out Donald Trump and Ted Cruz by name , he rejected what he called â€œindiscriminateâ€ � bombing as illegal , immoral and un - American .
â€œWe are bound by the laws of armed conflict and at the end of the day it doesnâ€ ™ t only matter whether or not you win , it matters how you win , â€ �
MacFarland told reporters on Monday .
As Iowans were set to caucus in the first presidential contest of 2016 , MacFarland said â€œindiscriminate bombing , where we donâ€
™ t care if weâ€
™ re killing innocents or combatants , is just inconsistent with our valuesâ€ � , despite two major White House contenders adopting it as a central proposal against Isis .
Trump , the Republican frontrunner , told an Iowa crowd he would â€œbomb the shit out of â€
™
em
â€
¦ there would be nothing leftâ€ � .
His closest rival , the Texas senator Ted Cruz , has repeatedly vowed to pursue the â€œfundamentally different military strategyâ€ � of carpet - bombing Isis without â€œapologyâ€ � , most recently in last Thursdayâ€
™ s debate .
â€œWe will carpet - bomb [ Isis ] into oblivion , â€ �
Cruz said in Iowa last month .
MacFarland said the proposal contravened military professionalism and likened it to â€œwhat the Russians have been accused of doing in parts of north - west Syriaâ€ � .
Russiaâ€ ™ s authoritarian president , Vladimir Putin , and Trump have traded praise .
MacFarland characterized Putinâ€ ™ s airstrikes on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al - Assad as a divergent objective from the US goal of defeating Isis .
Though MacFarland said his goal was to get home to his grandchildren , it is likely he will remain in command through the presidential election , and will in any case largely shape the war the next president will inherit .
Unlike previous military officials and even the man who appointed him last fall , defense secretary Ashton Carter , MacFarland pointedly declined to provide reporters with specifics about the changing nature of the war in Iraq and Syria , particularly over key details such as prospective US troop increases or the recently expanded role of special operations forces .
â€œIâ€ ™ d like the enemy to find out for the first time when the area around them is going up in smoke , â€ �
MacFarland said .
Yet MacFarland telegraphed that he was looking at proposing â€œadditional troopsâ€ � for the fight , particularly as he examines military capabilities that the current effort lacks .
He characterized the war as closer to the beginning than the end , stating that the â€œbeginning of the endâ€ � will come when Isis loses its Syrian capital , Raqqa .
MacFarland said the December recapture of Ramadi from Isis represented a â€œturning pointâ€ � in proving the prowess of the long - sponsored Iraqi military .
A forthcoming push to retake Mosul ,
Isisâ€ ™ s power base in Iraq and the countryâ€ ™ s second - largest city , could also include US attack helicopters , he said , in an intensification of US air support for what is expected to be a large operation this year .
Yet MacFarlane indicated that ridding Iraq of Isis completely is an unlikely goal .
Defeating Isis â€œas currently configuredâ€ � in Iraq â€ “ a conventional force that holds territory and fights along front lines â€ “
would not rule out its persistence as a â€œlow - grade insurgency [ or ] terrorist organizationâ€ � , even if Iraqi forces backed by the US and Iran reclaim the areas Isis currently occupies .
As an army colonel in 2006 in Ramadi , MacFarland made his reputation by embracing a nascent split between Sunni tribal chiefs and the faction of al - Qaida that would , years later , transform into Isis .
A decision by MacFarland , later adopted by higher US command , to align with Iraqi fighters he and other commanders had previously understood to be enemies became the genesis of the â€œAwakeningâ€ � , a realignment of allegiances that aided the Iraq warâ€ ™ s greatest period of tactical success .
But what the military has regarded as a turning point in the Iraq war has proven difficult to emulate .
A program inspired by the Awakening , the Afghan Local Police , has yielded instead turf battles within US - sponsored Afghan ministries and allegations of human - rights violations .
Around the time MacFarland took control of the war â€ “ an October 2015 move to consolidate a sprawling effort under a single officer â€ “ the Pentagon abandoned an expensive initiative to build a Sunni Syrian fighting force and opted instead to sponsor existing Kurdish and Sunni militant forces .
While MacFarland and other US military officials have characterized the airstrikes against Isis as among the most precise in the history of warfare , the US has recently begun conceding that it has mistakenly killed and wounded civilians .
The private organization Airwars , which attempts to track the civilian impact of the bombing , has tallied allegations of between 2,029 and 2,635 noncombatants mistakenly killed in nearly 18 months of bombings , two orders of magnitude beyond what US military officials have confirmed .
MacFarlane rejected criticism that recent attacks on Mosul facilities where Isis keeps its cash risked targeting civilians .
â€œIs an enemy banker
a combatant or not ?
Just because he doesnâ€ ™ t have an AK[-47 ] leaned up against a teller window ,
heâ€ ™ s still a bad guy , right?â€ � MacFarland said , stating that the US airstrikes occur during times the US assesses will minimize loss of life .
Hawkish legislators and presidential candidates have proposed loosening the rules under which US pilots can open fire on targets , claiming that the US hamstrings itself in target selection out of fear of inflicting additional death on civilians in areas where Isis operates .
MacFarland neither stated that he felt unreasonably constricted nor indicated sympathy to the critique , instead portraying distinctions between military from civilian targets as a battlefield advantage .
â€œRight now we have the moral high ground , and I think thatâ€ ™ s where we need to stay , â€ � he said ."
2016-02-02,"Two Cuban American senators representing the future of US conservatism are now locked in a battle to reshape the Republican primary and attempt to make history as the first Latino president of the US .
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , from Texas and Florida respectively , both defied expectations in the Iowa caucuses on Monday .
The two first - term senators , long viewed as rising stars within the GOP , had been jockeying for weeks to claim the mantle of the partyâ€ ™ s alternative to Donald Trump .
Their biographical similarities , although superficial , are nonetheless striking : both rode a Tea Party wave to the US Senate â€ “ Rubio in 2010 and Cruz in 2012 â€ “ often drawing on the inspirational tale of their immigrant parents to underscore the promise of America .
Both graduates of law and in their mid-40s , born only six months apart , they are also the youngest candidates in the race .
And while their attacks on each other may call it into question , there is little in their record to indicate that Rubio and Cruz are anything but staunchly conservative .
However , the parallels end there .
In their short tenure in elected office , Rubio and Cruz have played dramatically different roles both in Washington and the 2016 Republican primary .
Since arriving in the Senate in 2013 , Cruz quickly earned the reputation of a rabble rouser .
A conservative firebrand who boasts of â€œtaking on the Washington cartelâ€ �
, the Texan rose to national prominence by almost single - handedly leading the nation into its first government shutdown in 17 years .
He infamously decried Mitch McConnell â€ “ the leader of Senate Republicans â€ “ as â€œa liarâ€ � in a stunning breach of congressional decorum .
Such tactics have made Cruz arguably the most unpopular senator in either party , a tag he has worn as an asset in an election fuelled by frustration with Washington .
Needless to say , he has not been endorsed by any of his colleagues in the Senate â€ “ securing instead the support of the House GOPâ€ ™ s right wing .
In his quest for the Republican nomination , Cruz has united the partyâ€ ™ s evangelical and Tea Party wings and assembled support from a variety of influential figures on the right .
This , combined with a strong grassroots campaign that makes extensive use of technology , has led to some comparisons of the Texas senator with another young first - term senator , Barack Obama .
The similarities with Obama go deeper .
A fellow graduate of Harvard Law , Cruz clerked for supreme ourt chief justice William Rehnquist and argued a number of cases before the US supreme court as the solicitor general for the state of Texas .
And yet it is Rubio , 44 , who has drawn the most comparisons to Obama : a young senator in a hurry and a dynamic speaker pitching an optimistic message calling for a new generation of leadership .
He first ran for office at the age of 24 , setting off one of the more rapid ascensions in national political ranks in recent memory .
Elected to the Florida legislature in 1999 , Rubio went on to become both the stateâ€ ™ s youngest and first Cuban American speaker of the House .
Rubioâ€ ™ s unbridled ambition took him even further in 2010 , as he launched a long - shot bid for Floridaâ€ ™ s Senate seat against the will of the political establishment .
Charlie Crist , then the stateâ€ ™ s Republican governor , was the prime choice of party elders and national operatives .
But Rubio rose from polling at just 3 % to pull off an upset victory that made him an overnight star .
Rubio hopes to pull off another upset in 2016 , an election that was once thought to belong to his former mentor Jeb Bush .
Again , Rubio refused to wait his turn .
And although the establishment has yet to unite around Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy , he has ratcheted up key congressional endorsements and the support of high - dollar donors .
Despite this , he is no moderate â€ “ holding high marks from some of the largest conservative groups in the country .
But his prior support for comprehensive immigration reform remains a liability among the grassroots , and it is on this issue that he and Cruz are most at odds and have sparred in recent months .
They are also diametrically opposed on surveillance , with Rubio wishing to restore the NSAâ€ ™ s dragnet intelligence gathering methods and Cruz having voted to end its bulk collection of phone records .
And they hold a different view of what US foreign policy should resemble , with Rubio embracing more traditional neoconservatism and Cruz gravitating toward the non - interventionist leanings typically associated with libertarians .
Unlike Cruz , Rubio is well - liked among his colleages in the Senate â€ “ which may be viewed with scepticism by Republican primary voters but could enable him to rally the party around his candidacy .
His goal , he has said , is to unite the Republican party .
To do so , he will have to persuade those leaning toward Cruz and Trump that anger alone is insufficient ."
2016-02-02,"Texas maverick Ted Cruz dramatically burst the bubble of Donald Trump on Monday in a surprise victory over his Republican rival in the Iowa caucus that supporters hope will herald a rightwing resurgence to match that of Ronald Reagan .
Ignoring the media - friendly bombast of Trump in favor of a purer strain of anti - establishment conservatism , Republicans in the state voted in favor of Cruz , according to initial projections by the Associated Press .
Florida senator Marco Rubio had a strong night , snapping at Trumpâ€ ™ s heels and running a close third .
With 99.9 % of votes in , Cruz held a 27.7 % to 24.3 % lead over Trump , with Rubio at 23.1 % .
In the Democratic camp , former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton was locked in a virtual tie with Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders with more than 99 % of the precincts counted .
The Associated Press and multiple outlets said the race was simply too close to call .
In a victory speech in Des Moines , Cruz told a cheering crowd : â€œGod bless the great state of Iowa ...
To God be the glory.â€
�
The Texas senator said his victory was a victory for the grassroots and â€œcourageous conservativesâ€ � across the state and the country .
â€œIowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media , will not be chosen by the Washington establishment , will not be chosen by the lobbyists , but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force where all sovereignty resides in our nation : by we the people , the American people.â€ �
He said he had won the most votes ever cast for any Republican caucus winner in Iowa .
â€œTonight
Iowa has proclaimed to the world : morning is coming , â€ � he said .
â€œWhatever Washington says , they can not keep the people down.â€ �
The vote , he said , showed that his supporters were yearning to get back to free market and â€œJudeo - Christian
valuesâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re thrilled , â€ � said Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier .
â€œThis is what we have been working towards â€ “
we spent months building a ground game unparalleled to any campaign and itâ€ ™ s paid off .
Weâ€ ™ re excited about the momentum we have going into the next states and national organization that will carry us through to the end.â€ �
She praised â€œhow hard Senator Cruz has worked in Iowaâ€ � and his â€œability to bring conservatives in Iowa on board the campaignâ€ � .
No one would have considered him a â€œNo 2 pickâ€ � for next
weekâ€ ™ s
New Hampshire primary , she added .
Trump congratulated Cruz in a concession speech after the result was called .
â€œOn June 16 , when we started this journey , I was told by everybody , do not go to Iowa .
They said , â€˜Donâ€ ™ t do it.â€ ™
I said I have to do it .
â€œAnd we finished second , and let me tell you something , Iâ€ ™ m honored , Iâ€ ™ m just honored ...
Weâ€ ™ re just so happy with the way everythingâ€ ™ s worked out.â€
� He praised Iowa and Iowans , adding :
â€œI think I might come here and buy a farm.â€ �
And he looked ahead to the next two races , saying : â€œWe love New Hampshire and we love South Carolina.â€
�
The mood at his party in western Des Moines went from subdued when it emerged he had been pushed into second place by Cruz to outright downbeat when it became apparent he had almost tied with third - place Rubio .
Behind Cruz and Trump , Rubio dominated over Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich , who are now left in a battle for survival .
None of the other establishment figures had expected to make many waves in Iowa , but they barely registered on a dismal night .
Defiant Rubio A defiant Rubio echoed the words of Barack Obama in 2008 when he took the stage at his caucus night party in Des Moines .
â€œSo this is the moment they said would never happen .
For months , they told us we had no chance , â€ �
Rubio told a raucous crowd inside a ballroom at the downtown Marriott .
â€œThey told me I needed to wait my turn .
They told me we had no chance because my hair wasnâ€ ™ t gray enough and my boots were too high , â€ �
he said , referring to a minor media storm about his Cuban heel boots .
â€œBut tonight , here in Iowa , the people of this great state have sent a very clear message after seven years of Barack Obama : we are not waiting any longer.â€ � Rubio made an aggressive push in the final weeks before the Iowa caucus , ramping up his appearances in the state and racking up endorsements from a wide array of faith leaders .
He focused his closing argument on electability , arguing that only he could unify a fractured Republican party .
Cruz had inched ahead in recent opinion polls but appeared to have stumbled when Trump raised questions over whether his birth to a US mother in Canada invalidated his right to serve as president .
But despite this distraction and a position against ethanol subsidies that was thought to be unpopular among rural voters in a state where corn is the biggest export , Cruz overcame the setbacks with the help of strong support from evangelical voters and the Republican Tea Party wing .
Trumpâ€ ™
s
fate hung on whether he could translate the widespread support expressed to pollsters and remarkable turnouts at his rallies into turnout among Republicans taking part in the caucuses .
â€œI wondered if they would really turn out to vote and it turns out that they werenâ€ ™ t real , and reality started tonight , â€ � said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler .
The threat of bad winter weather barreling towards the western end of the state Monday evening did not become a factor .
Turnout appeared to be high , with reports of some precincts running out of paperwork to register first time caucus - goers .
It had been anticipated that high turnout would be good for Trump , but the New York tycoonâ€ ™ s lack of organization on the ground cost him .
By contrast , Cruz had a highly sophisticated ground game that had recruited caucus captains and volunteers across the state and made aggressive use of data capture on Facebook , using detailed psychological profiling techniques to sway voters .
As the night unfolded , Cruz soon opened up a three - point lead , which he was able to sustain .
With half of the precincts reporting , he had hit 28.9 % to Trumpâ€ ™ s 25.2 % .
Rubio , on 21.1 % , was closing in and the rest of the field floundering .
On Monday , shortly before voting began across the state , the senator visited his 99th county since campaigning began â€ “ a clean sweep of the sparsely populated Hawkeye state known as the â€œfull Grassleyâ€ � â€ “ named after Chuck Grassley , the senator from that state who pioneered such high - intensity campaigning .
Though fractionally less prone to headline - grabbing outbursts than Trump , Cruz has nonetheless fought one of the most extreme conservative campaigns for many years and offers a stark contrast with the Democratic nominee .
His foreign policy in particular eclipses even that of the New York property magnate in its belligerence , including calls to â€œcarpet bombâ€
�
Islamic State forces in Syria until the sand â€œglowedâ€ � .
Cruz has also become unpopular among Republican colleagues in the Senate for a history of obstructionism that saw him play a leading role in a government shutdown , part of a failed bid to force Barack Obama to roll back his healthcare reforms .
Nevertheless , the senator has also been a champion of civil liberties , joining Kentucky colleague Rand Paul in promoting surveillance reform after revelations by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden .
â€œWho do you know who will kill the terrorists , defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?â€ �
Cruz boasted to supporters in Hubbard , Iowa , this weekend .
Cruz remains behind Trump in polls in New Hampshire , the next state to vote , in eight daysâ€ ™ time , but has strong support in the largely southern â€œSuper Tuesdayâ€ � states that mark a potential turning point in the race on 1 March .
With Trumpâ€ ™ s once unstoppable momentum slowed in Iowa , attention is now likely to focus on the battle between Cruz and Florida senator Marco Rubio , whose strong third place showing in Iowa puts him in a strong position to do well in New Hampshire next week ."
2016-02-02,"If youâ€ ™ re waking up to the news that Donald Trump lost to Ted Cruz in Iowa , you might be surprised â€ “ especially if you were closely following the polls that said he would defeat Cruz by almost six percentage points .
That wasnâ€ ™ t the only upset on Monday night .
It looks like Marco Rubio , who was expected to take about 17 % of the vote , will have actually walked home with 23 % by the time all votes are counted .
And the Hillary Clinton victory by a four percentage point margin ahead of Bernie Sanders failed to materialise â€ “ instead , the two candidates appear to have finished neck and neck .
In the end , even turnout was a bit of a surprise ; 5.6 % higher than in 2012 , according to exit polling from Edison Media Research .
But itâ€ ™ s premature to forecast the demise of polling accuracy based on those errors .
For one thing , general election polls tend to perform better while caucuses are notoriously difficult to predict â€ “ there are just so many uncertainties about everything from weather ( would snow keep people at home ? )
to the effect college term dates might have on turnout .
Thatâ€ ™ s not the only factor that makes Iowa results hard to interpret .
At national elections , vote share matters .
In Democratic caucuses though , itâ€ ™ s state delegate equivalents ( SDE ) that count and those are calculated based on how many county delegates candidates manage to amass .
That means that even if Iowa were demographically similar to the rest of the US ( itâ€ ™ s not ) , results here wouldnâ€ ™ t necessarily be indicative of national sentiment .
Confused ?
Iâ€ ™ m not surprised , but this video should help .
In other words , caucuses are weird .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t mean Monday nightâ€ ™ s results are inconsequential .
Winning here can dramatically shape a candidateâ€ ™ s
public image â€ “ no wonder then that Clintonâ€ ™ s speech in Iowa sounded suspiciously like a winnerâ€ ™ s acceptance despite the fact that at the time of delivering it , she was no such thing .
And , after repeatedly quoting Walter Hagenâ€ ™ s words : â€œNo one remembers who came in secondâ€ � , Donald Trump might regret his Twitter stream as well as his overall â€œloserâ€ � election rhetoric strategy .
Those aforementioned Iowa SDEs can also have a long - lasting effect on Democratic nominations further down the line .
An analysis from the Cook Political Report found that Sanders needed to not just tie with Clinton in Iowa ; to be in with a real chance , he needed to walk away with two - thirds of delegates .
What next ?
It would be unwise to draw firm and definitive conclusions from the outcome of a single contest that represents about 1 % of the Democrat and Republican delegate tally .
Iowa matters , though .
It finally brings some clarity to a race after months of speculation and it sets the scene moving forward .
There are at least two signals that can be discerned from the caucusesâ€ ™ results : first , how the candidates performed against expectations .
And second , Iowa provides a tangible hint of the candidatesâ€ ™ demographic strengths and weaknesses .
On the basis of these two measures , the Democratic lane of the race is more straightforward .
Expectations were for a close election .
And with Sanders and Clinton virtually tied it could not have been closer .
However , demographically , Iowa is a Sanders - friendly state : more white and liberal than the country as a whole .
Sandersâ€ ™ path to the nomination should , in theory , have passed through a big win in Iowa .
Although Sanders may well go on to win New Hampshire next week ( he is leading in the polls there and
the stateâ€ ™ s fundamentals are even more akin to his support base ) , the Vermont senator is unlikely to dent Clintonâ€ ™ s chances in larger more diverse states .
There is one unknown in this theory : the perception , however manufactured , of momentum .
A scenario where Clinton does not claim a clear victory until South Carolina ( 27 February ) is not inconceivable â€ “ and would mean weeks of nervous headlines .
But until there are signs that Sanders is making a breakthrough with older voters and minorities â€ “ and there arenâ€ ™ t any yet â€ “ it would be premature to put your chips on the momentum argument .
The Republican contest is a lot more difficult to read .
Cruz needed a win â€ “ and he got a clear one .
An ideologically conservative candidate won in a state that is more conservative and evangelical than the nationwide average .
Although he is behind in the polls in New Hampshire , it would be a mistake to equate Cruz to Rick Santorum or Mike Huckabee , whose campaigns imploded after winning Iowa in 2012 and 2008 respectively .
By winning Iowa , Cruz has probably shut the door on the already slim chances of the other more conservative candidates â€ “ but make no mistake , his appeal goes beyond just the Christian vote and his campaign is better organised than that of the two previous Iowa winners .
The big question ahead of Iowa was whether
Trumpâ€ ™ s polling numbers were â€œrealâ€
� .
They did not live up to the hype .
Trump was closer to coming third than to winning .
However , the billionaire candidate entered Iowa with a small lead in the polls , while in New Hampshire his numbers are far more substantial and he still benefits from a crowded field .
The question now though is can he recover from being a loser ?
The other winner on the night was Marco Rubio .
He outperformed the polls , placed clear daylight between himself and the other â€œmainstreamâ€ � candidates â€ “ Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich â€ “ and , crucially , his campaign is perceived to be on the rise .
In a field so packed , and dominated for months by one person , such a strong third place finish is quite remarkable .
The Florida senatorâ€ ™
s result is uncomfortable reading for Bush , Christie and Kasich .
There is not much time left ( â€œsuper Tuesdayâ€ � , with many states simultaneously in play , is on 1 March ) for them to emerge as the mainstream alternative to the Cruz - Trump show before the contest eventually thins into a more conventional affair .
On this particular front , Rubio now has a leg up on all three ."
2016-02-03,"Even for some in his own party , the growing prospect of a Ted Cruz presidency is a nightmarish prospect , but no one could accuse the Texas senator of failing to give them plenty of advance warning .
Cruz confounded opinion polls by winning the Iowa Republican caucuses on Monday , but according to a vision of the future he set out nearly three decades ago , moving one step closer to the White House by beating Donald Trump merely conformed to his expectations .
â€œUpon graduation Ted hopes to attend Princeton University and major in Political Science and Economics .
From there he wants to attend law school ( possibly Harvard ) and achieve a successful law practice , â€ � said a biographical note from around 1988 about the then 17-year - old .
â€œHe then wants to pursue his real goal â€ “ a career in politics .
Ted would like to run for various political offices and eventually achieve a strong enough reputation and track record to run for â€ “ and win â€ “ President of the United States.â€ �
After high school , Cruz went to Princeton ( majoring in Public Policy ) , attended Harvard Law School , became a successful lawyer and was elected a US senator for Texas .
He is now running for president .
Thatâ€ ™ s five goals checked off â€ “ one more to go .
Cruz articulated his towering ambition less elegantly in a video that emerged on YouTube last month that combines schoolboy humour with Texas bravado .
It was apparently filmed in 1988 , when he was a high school senior at Second Baptist School , a Bible - centric private school in Houston â€ “ long before he arrived in Washington pledging to upend the Republican establishment .
â€œAspirations ?
Is that like sweat on my butt?â€ � he asks .
â€œWell , my aspiration is to , I donâ€
™ t know , be in a teen tit film like that guy who played Horatio â€ “ you know , he was in Malibu Bikini Beach Shop ?
Well , other than that , take over the world .
World domination .
Yeah , rule everything .
Rich , powerful , that sort of stuff.â€ �
In his early teens , Cruz was a member of the Constitutional Corroborators , part of a five - strong â€œunitâ€ � of high - achieving , politically minded students managed by Rolland Storey , a retired gas executive from Houston .
Storey ran an after - school programme under the banner of a conservative thinktank called the Free Enterprise Education Center ( now the Free Enterprise Institute ) .
It was crucial in honing Cruzâ€ ™ s public speaking skills and economic views .
Storey taught a set of principles dubbed the Ten Pillars of Economic Wisdom .
Cruz has been especially fond of the second pillar : â€œGovernment is never a source of goods .
Everything produced is produced by the people , and everything that government gives to the people , it must first take from the people.â€ �
He tapped into widespread anti - big - government sentiment in his state on the way to winning a Senate seat as an underdog candidate in 2012 , and he has stuck to this theme .
The Corroborators toured Rotary clubs and chambers of commerce in Houston and across Texas .
Their star turn was in setting up easels and writing summaries of the constitution from memory â€ “ along with a definition of socialism , so that everyone was clear on the enemy .
In his 2015 autobiography , A Time for Truth , Cruz recalled that they gave half - hour presentations on the constitution that ended with a patriotic poem , I Am an American .
If this sounds like the sort of hobby unlikely to make him a sought - after guest at parties , the young Cruz would have agreed .
As he was formulating a political outlook that has barely wavered since â€ “ enabling his current self - branding as a consistent , bold conservative â€ “ he was also hatching a plan to develop a likable personality .
â€œMidway through junior high school , I decided that Iâ€ ™ d had enough of being the unpopular nerd , â€ � he wrote in his book .
â€œI remember sitting up one night asking a friend why I wasnâ€ ™ t one of the popular kids .
I ended up staying up most of that night thinking about it .
â€˜Okay ,
well , what is it that the popular kids do ?
I will consciously emulate that.â€ ™ â€ �
He embraced sports and replaced his glasses with contact lenses .
His braces came off and he saw a dermatologist who improved his acne .
According to this book , he was suspended from high school for several days for going to a party , drinking and smoking pot .
On other occasions , he wrote , he was beaten up by drunk older kids at 2 am , and reprimanded by the principal for a prank that involved covering a rival schoolâ€ ™ s building in toilet paper and shaving cream , then fleeing in a 1978 Ford Fairmont with Wagnerâ€ ™ s Ride of the Valkyries blaring out of the car stereo .
Cruz had become popular and respected when , seeking more academic stimulation than he had found at his previous school , he transferred midway through his junior year of high school to Second Baptist , a small private establishment on the campus of a megachurch in one of Houstonâ€ ™ s greenest and most desirable areas .
Today , Cruzâ€ ™ s family home and campaign headquarters are only a couple of miles away .
Former students and teachers contacted by the Guardian said that Cruz was a brilliant student whose political plans were already crystallizing .
â€œHe was very intelligent , a valedictorian the year he graduated .
He knew early on he wanted to be in politics and government , â€ � said Gary Moore , a Second Baptist pastor .
A classmate , Laurie Rankin Carl , said : â€œHe fit right in â€ ¦ he was head of our class.â€
�
Cruz was heavily involved in extracurricular activities , including the drama club , the public speaking team and sundry school publications .
He played American football , soccer and basketball .
He was twice class president and vice - president of the student body .
â€œHe was very well liked by the teachers and his classmates and was generally considered a prodigy , â€ � said John Fuex , who was a year below Cruz .
â€œSecond Baptist had a culture where being an academic was about on par with being a star athlete .
That school was chock full of children of high achievers who already knew they wanted to follow the same path and how important education was to that goal.â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s
English teacher and guidance counsellor , Elsa Jean Looser , now 76 , said he was a â€œdream studentâ€ � interested in literature , history and government .
â€œWe all knew he had political ambitions simply because of the direction he was taking .
He wanted to do well in all his classes , which he did ; he wanted to go to fine schools ; he wanted to build a good resumÃ
© .
â€œHe was a tremendous debater .
His whole life was just being directed that way .
There was no question he was aspiring to be a lawyer and then move into the political arena , â€ �
she said .
â€œHe gets bad press , which is so sad because heâ€ ™ s just doing what he said he would do.â€
�
Another school friend , Zachary Emmanouil , even credited Cruz with saving his life after a vacation incident in Cancun , Mexico , where the Cruz family had a timeshare .
Emmanouil recalled by email that he became strangely dizzy after drinking a rum and Coke at a bar and suspects his drink was spiked by thieves who wanted to steal his gold jewellery .
â€œI had made it to the condo property , but I became so dizzy that I was lying right next to the pool , chest down , with one arm in the water .
I could have easily moved to the side and fallen and drowned in the pool .
Ted was shorter and thinner than me , but he ran over to me , lifted me , and placed me in one of those reclining chairs next to the pool , â€ �
he said .
â€œI remember hearing Ted scooping water with his hands from the pool and splashing it on to my face .
I also remember Ted repeatedly wanting to call a doctor , but I kept telling him , â€˜No , no , Iâ€ ™ m better now.â€ ™ Ted told me something like , â€˜OK , Zachary , but Iâ€ ™ m not leaving your side until youâ€ ™ re absolutely sure that youâ€ ™ re okay.â€ ™ Ted never left my side â€ “ Ted stayed with me outside in the pool area until the sun came up and I started feeling much better .
You could say that Ted saved my life.â€ �
As a fellow Constitutional Corroborator , Laura Calaway spent a week during spring break travelling around Texas in a van with Cruz in 1988 .
â€œIn hindsight it was all very exciting and I felt important to be a part of this educational group , â€ � she said .
Still , he did not make a good first impression on her .
As a high school senior from the blue - collar Houston suburb of Deer Park , she felt that Cruz â€ “ a veteran Corroborator whose reputation as a formidable debater preceded him â€
“ was aloof .
â€œWhen we are introduced , it is the first time I feel as if someone has sized me up , found me wanting and moved on â€ ¦ all before I finish â€˜helloâ€ ™ .
It is not a good feeling .
I donâ€
™ t think Iâ€ ™ m going to like Ted , â€ � she wrote in an article on Medium last month .
â€œI remember that vividly , â€ �
she said at a coffee shop in Houston on Tuesday .
â€œAn
18-year - old girl in a suburban , small - ish town â€ “ Iâ€ ™ d never been so quickly summed up like that before.â€ � Calaway has few other memories of Cruz , but recalled that he found it hard to bond with the others during the road trip .
The suggestion echoes criticsâ€ ™ claims that Cruz , for all his eloquence and Texan swagger , can seem stilted in public , too calculating to connect emotionally with his audience .
â€œI think this is a lifetime struggle of his ; he couldnâ€ ™ t relate to us as a group of teenagers .
He really struggled in trying to be part of a group dynamic , and the jokes , â€ � she said .
Her politics have since skewed to the left , and the personalised licence plate on her SUV reads â€ “ using the six letters typical to Texas â€ “ â€œHILARYâ€ � in tribute to Hillary Clinton .
Seeing Trump and Cruz sparring for the Republican presidential nomination is â€œvastly entertaining in a heartbreaking kind of wayâ€ � , she said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like Stephen Colbert [ quoting former Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham ] said : â€˜Do you want to die by poisoning or firing squad?â€ ™
â€ �
Cruz was not universally admired at university , either .
Craig Mazin , the Hollywood screenwriter of The Hangover Part II and Part III , spent much of the 24 hours after Cruzâ€ ™ s Iowa triumph issuing Twitter jabs at the man who was his freshman roommate at Princeton .
â€œI would rather have anybody else be the president of the United States .
Anyone , â€ � Mazin told the Daily Beast in 2013 .
â€œI would rather pick somebody from the phone book.â€ �"
2016-02-03,"Ben Carson held one of the strangest press conferences of the 2016 campaign cycle on Wednesday , to attack Republican rival Ted Cruz for spreading rumors that the retired neurosurgeon was dropping out on the night of the Iowa caucuses .
Carson refused to mention the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s name throughout .
Carson had announced that the topic of the hastily convened event at the National Press Club in Washington DC would be â€œdeceptive
Iowa caucus tacticsâ€ � , adding : â€œHow a person conducts his life or campaign is an indication of who he is .
In Matthew 7 , Jesus Himself says that a tree â€ “ and people of faith â€ “ are known by their fruit , not just the words they say.â€
�
Carsonâ€ ™ s statement to the press did not mention Cruz or Iowa .
Instead , he focused on his worries about what type of image children might receive if society settled for anything less than â€œcomplete excellenceâ€ � from politicians , and proudly proclaimed that he did not take money from special interest groups .
Reporters had to tease out of him the fact that the press conference was called in response to the Cruzâ€ ™ s campaignâ€
™ s
conduct and it took a number of questions for Carson to explicitly state this .
The retired neurosurgeon told reporters that Cruz had apologized to him and that the Texas senator had insisted he did not know anything about what happened .
Carson acknowledged that Cruz â€œcould very well have not known about itâ€ � but said :
â€œItâ€ ™ s obvious there were people in his organization who not only knew about it but carried it out.â€ � Cruz has issued an apology of sorts to the Carson campaign for spreading the rumor on election night that Carson was dropping out of the race , which Cruz characterized as an honest â€œmistakeâ€ � .
â€œLast night , when our political team saw the CNN post saying that Dr Carson was not carrying on to New Hampshire and South Carolina , our campaign updated grassroots leaders just as we would with any breaking news story , â€ �
Cruz said in a statement on Tuesday .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s fair game .
What the team then should have done was send around the follow - up statement from the Carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out.â€
�
The incident led fellow candidate Donald Trump to accuse Cruz of fraud on Wednesday , writing on Twitter : â€œMany people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud.â€ �
In a response to a question from the Guardian about whether Cruz should fire the staff members responsible , Carson said : â€œLet me put it this way .
When there were things in my campaign I couldnâ€ ™ t agree with after doing an investigation , I made changes .
I think thatâ€ ™ s what a good leader does : if there are things going on that you donâ€ ™ t agree with , you need to make changes .
If he agrees with it , he doesnâ€ ™ t need to make changes , â€ � said Carson .
He added : â€œThat would be hypocritical , wouldnâ€ ™ t it , to go against your beliefs?â€ � The retired neurosurgeon also refused to comment on Trumpâ€ ™ s demands for a do - over in Iowa as a result of Cruzâ€ ™ s tactics .
Carson did not take responsibility for the initial statement from his campaign that spurred the rumors that he might drop out .
A campaign spokesman told CNN on Monday night that the doctor would be going home to Florida for some â€œfresh clothesâ€
� .
Carson insisted to reporters : â€œI didnâ€ ™ t make that announcement .
Donâ€ ™ t blame
me.â€
�
He further dodged questions by about whether , like Cruz , he should be responsible for his campaignâ€ ™ s statement , saying defensively : â€œIs it OK after three weeks on the road to go home get a fresh change of clothes ?
Does make someone an evil , horrible person?â€ �
In response to a question about whether he might indeed drop out of the race , Carson compared the election to the game of baseball .
â€œYou know , one of the things that really represents America is baseball .
Have you noticed in a baseball game , there are nine innings and you donâ€
™ t call the game after the first inning?â€ �"
2016-02-03,"Donald Trump has claimed Ted Cruz committed â€œfraudâ€ � in his successful campaign to win the Republican Iowa caucuses on Monday , and has called for a new election .
The businessman , who came in second in Iowa , tweeted : Earlier , Trump accused Cruz of â€œstealingâ€ � the election in the key state , the first to vote in this stage of the 2016 presidential election .
He accused the Cruz campaign of telling Iowa voters that fellow candidate Ben Carson was quitting the race so he could steal Carsonâ€ ™ s votes .
â€œDuring primetime of the Iowa Caucus , Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race , and to caucus ( or vote ) for Cruz , â€ �
Trump wrote .
â€œMany people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud .
Also , Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters .
â€œThe Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter ( grade of F ) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz .
Fraud.â€ �
He added that â€œCruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers ( voters ) that Trump was strongly in favor of Obamacare and â€˜choiceâ€ ™ â€ “ a total lie!â€ �
Cruz had issued an apology of sorts to the Carson campaign for spreading the rumor on election night that Carson was dropping out of the race , which Cruz characterized as an honest â€œmistakeâ€ � : â€œLast night when our political team saw the CNN post saying that Dr Carson was not carrying on to New Hampshire and South Carolina , our campaign updated grassroots leaders just as we would with any breaking news story , â€ �
Cruz said in a statement on Tuesday .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s fair game .
What the team then should have done was send around the follow - up statement from the Carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out.â€ �
In addition , the Texas senator and his presidential campaign were formally denounced by top state officials for sending mailers to Iowa voters accusing them of a â€œvoting
violationâ€
�
â€ “ in an apparent effort to scare voters to the polls .
The mailers included a voting score and included the phrase â€œofficial public recordâ€ � .
They referred to the recipients by name , and also their neighbors , as part of a broader attempt to shame them for not having participated in prior elections .
Some campaign observers criticized Trump for decrying what was simply politics as usual .
Stuart Stevens , a former strategist for 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney , wrote : To beat John McCain in South Carolina in 2000 , the George W Bush campaign used a Bible professor to spread a rumor that â€œMcCain chose to sire children without marriageâ€ � .
Lee Atwater helped George HW Bush beat Michael Dukakis in 1988 by cutting a racist commercial tying Dukakis to a rape and stabbing by convicted murderer Willie Horton while on furlough ."
2016-02-03,"In a Twitter storm , Donald Trump , the Iowa runner - up , accused winner Ted Cruz of â€œfraudâ€ � and called for â€œa new electionâ€ � .

2016-02-03,"Of the likely places to host a feminist art exhibition , the Dallas Contemporary doesnâ€ ™ t immediately come to mind .
Texas is the state of GOP presidential hopeful Senator Ted Cruz , where battles over womenâ€ ™ s reproductive rights have moved to the supreme court as recently as November .
Enter the Dallas Contemporaryâ€ ™ s latest exhibition Black Sheep Feminism : the Art of Sexual Politics , open now .
Curated by Alison Gingeras , the exhibition aims to explore the works of artists Joan Semmel , Anita Steckel , Betty Tompkins and Cosey Fanni Tutti , who were pushed to the outer edges of second - wave feminism and largely ignored .
Influenced by her own research on the genealogy of Jeff Koons , Gingeras realized Koonsâ€ ™ s notorious series Made in Heaven â€ “ which depicted him and his future wife , porn star Ilona Staller , having sex in explicit detail
â€ “ was influenced by â€œa matrilineage of feminist artistsâ€ � , on the edges of what is now understood to be the feminist art movement .
Looking at Koonsâ€ ™ s portraits , it is not difficult to find the influences of Semmel and Tompkins : where Semmel explicitly portrayed heterosexual intercourse in her first and second erotic series , Tompkins based her paintings on photographs from pornographic magazines , centering on the act of heterosexual penetration in her series Fuck Paintings .
The difference is , of course , we are thoroughly aware of who Koons is ; we canâ€
™ t necessarily say the same of Semmel or Tompkins .
For that matter , the average museum viewer
canâ€ ™ t say the same of Steckel â€ “ who founded the Fight Censorship group that claimed artists Louise Bourgeois and Hannah Wilke as members â€ “ or Tutti , who may be better known for her music career in the UK band Throbbing Gristle than her landmark exhibition Prostitution .
At first glance , there is nothing terribly shocking about the art of any of these women .
Tompkinsâ€ ™ paintings are so up - close that context is nearly removed , and Steckelâ€ ™ s series Giant Woman , comprised of silkscreen landscapes of nude women standing alongside the phallic New York City skyline , are not a matter of outrage .
Tuttiâ€ ™ s sex work and poses in pornographic magazines
â€ “ which she then displayed as her own art
â€ “ would be greeted with applause now .
But it is 2016 , and we are in the fourth wave of feminism .
The anti - pornographic movements of second - wave feminism seem antiquated .
Perhaps the greatest testament of Black Sheep Feminismâ€ ™ s power is that the outrage is irrelevant now for young feminists ; sex positivity is the order of the day .
And yet , even in 2007 when Los Angelesâ€ ™ Museum of Contemporary Art put together the encyclopedic exhibition Wack !
Art and the Feminist Revolution , only Semmel and Tutti were included , though Steckel received mention in art historian Richard Meyerâ€ ™ s essay for the exhibitionâ€ ™ s catalogue .
Itâ€ ™ s this sort of exclusion that initially turned Gingeras off to feminism as a college student .
â€œI felt a little disconnected or ambivalent about that label of feminism because it didnâ€ ™ t feel that it applied to my generationâ€ ™ s challenges .
We took for granted all the advancements that the womenâ€ ™ s liberation movement made , â€ � she tells the Guardian .
â€œMy generation was taught by people who were directly part of second - wave feminism , and I felt like there was a lot of self - policing within feminism .
It was OK to think this , but not that .
It felt very stilted.â€ � .
Even among Steckelâ€ ™ s group Fight Censorship , self - policing was in action : Betty Tompkins was not invited to join .
â€œShe was a lightning rod for her peers , and she was completely excluded , â€ � Gingeras explained .
â€œShe knew all the artists in the Fight Censorship group , and she wasnâ€ ™ t invited to join their group because they objected to the source material.â€ �
The nature of Tompkinsâ€ ™ work â€ “ sourced from pornography â€ “ is complicated by the fact that the sale of any pornographic imagery was illegal at the time in the US .
And while there is still shock value to Tompkinsâ€ ™ work , the ease with which anyone with a computer can access pornography detracts from the outrage .
Itâ€ ™ s the far - sighted quality of Tompkinsâ€ ™ work , and of all the artists in the exhibition , that Gingeras believes will resonate most with audiences now .
â€œThey were very much ahead of their time , and as a consequence , they really resonate with the zeitgeist of a new generation returning to feminism and vindicating that term without any ambivalence or any shame.â€ �
As feminism sheds the at times stilted quality of its second wave , Black Sheep Feminism stands alongside works like Roxane Gayâ€ ™ s 2014 essay collection Bad Feminist that examine how feminism continues to change and grow into the 21st century .
Itâ€ ™ s part of a larger moment of embracing all the possibilities of feminism that couldnâ€ ™ t have come at a more crucial time in Texas and the US at large .
While Gingeras isnâ€ ™ t certain of the reaction her exhibit will receive , she is prepared either way .
At the very least , the public - at - large may have a chance to become better acquainted with the names of the artists in it .
Maybe , perhaps , Cruz will even have his consciousness raised by it .
Black Sheep Feminism is at Dallas Contemporary until 20 March .

2016-02-04,"Last year , Naheed Nenshi , the mayor of Canadaâ€ ™ s energy capital Calgary , Alberta , appeared on MSNBC to promote the controversial Keystone XL pipeline .
But before he could get to his points , the host pointed out that Calgary was home to a US presidential candidate .
â€œI am the the mayor of the birthplace of Ted Cruz , â€ � admitted Nenshi .
â€œAnd weâ€ ™ re real proud of it.â€
�
There was more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice .
Approving Keystone might be the only thing the Muslim mayor and the evangelical Texas senator who wants to â€œcarpet bombâ€ � the Middle East would agree on .
And while Alberta has been called â€œTexas of the Northâ€ � â€ “ and Calgary â€œa frigid Dallasâ€ �
â€ “ the prospect that the 45th US president may be a hometown boy
is more often a mark of shame than a badge of honour .
Cruz lived in the city until he was four , while his mother â€ “ who later took out Canadian citizenship â€ “ and Cuban - American father worked in Albertaâ€ ™ s oil and gas sector .
In the US , Cruzâ€ ™ s birthplace has been the subject of debate among both his rivals and constitutional scholars , but in Canadaâ€ ™ s north few had paid attention to the matter until the senatorâ€ ™ s surprise victory at the Republican Iowa caucus this week .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a bit shocked and disappointed in the people of Iowa
, â€ � says Mary Eggermont - Molenaar â€ “ who was shocked herself to learn last year that for the past 30 years sheâ€ ™ s lived in the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s childhood home .
â€œIt was a sombre night in Casa Cruz.â€
�
Eggermont - Molenaar , a Dutch immigrant , is a staunch socialist , but Cruzâ€ ™ s far - right politics rarely resonate even among Albertaâ€ ™ s conservatives .
â€œIâ€
™ m horrified that heâ€ ™ s even associated with Canada , â€ � says Dan St Pierre , a politically active conservative in the capital , Edmonton .
â€œTo be perfectly blunt
I think Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are batshit crazy .
The upside , says St Pierre , is he doubts many Albertans know his name ,
let alone that he was born there .
If Cruz was quick to disavow his Alberta roots , many Albertans have been quicker to disavow him .
â€œAs far as Iâ€ ™ m concerned , heâ€
™ s
a Texan , not a fellow Albertan
, â€ � says Houston Meding , a legislative assistant to a conservative senator who grew up in the provinceâ€ ™ s Bible belt .
â€œIâ€ ™ m happy
he supports Keystone but thereâ€
™ s a ton of rancour and chest - thumping in his rhetoric , like carpet bombing Isis .
I wouldnâ€
™ t be happy to see Ted Cruz become president.â€ �
This may come as a surprise to even many Canadians .
Alberta overwhelmingly votes right in federal politics .
Former prime minister Stephen Harperâ€ ™ s electoral district is in Calgary , and heâ€ ™ s a product of whatâ€ ™ s often dubbed the â€œCalgary Schoolâ€ � â€ “
the northâ€ ™
s answer to Leo Straussâ€ ™ s neoconservative movement .
As the New Republic put it in an article about Cruzâ€ ™ s roots : â€œIf you canâ€
™ t be born in conservative America , Calgary is about as close to second best as the world has to offer.â€
�
That may be true of the Calgary in which Rafael and Eleanor Cruz raised little â€œFelitoâ€ � .
But much has changed in Canadaâ€ ™ s conservative heartland , which last May elected a leftist provincial government after 44 uninterrupted years of conservative rule .
Even Albertans overestimate the conservativeness of their neighbours , according to a survey of a 1,000 residents by leftist lobby group Progress Alberta .
â€œMaybe Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s brand of conservatism would have resonated 20 years ago , â€ � says the groupâ€ ™ s executive director , Duncan Kinney , â€œBut weâ€ ™ ve gotten younger , more urban , more educated , and those traits donâ€ ™ t correlate with a hardcore Cruz - esque conservative.â€ � â€œHe may have been born here , but he doesnâ€ ™ t represent us in any way.â€ � Thatâ€ ™ s not to say he doesnâ€ ™ t have any hometown fans .
But outside of the fringe religious right , support is tepid .
â€œTo be honest , I kind of like Ted Cruz , â€ � says Cochrane town councillor Morgan Nagel .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a more moderate alternative to Donald Trump.â€ �
â€œPresident Cruzâ€ � would not be a huge point of pride for Nagel .
But , he says , â€œmaybe if we get a Calgarian in there , that Keystone pipeline will finally get through.â€ �
( President Obama vetoed the Keystone plan a year ago , but many Canadians still hold on to the possibility that it can be realized . )
For Trevor Lynn , a left - leaning Calgary speechwriter who worked for the Canadian government under Liberal rule , Cruzâ€ ™ s appeal is strictly personal .
â€œWe were born in the same hospital .
He grew up in north - west Calgary and so did I.
He is vying for one of the most important jobs in the world , whether or not heâ€
™ s my cup of tea ,
itâ€ ™ s neat when anyone from Calgary does well.â€

Since learning that she owned his childhood home , author and scholar Eggermont - Molenaar has started studying the â€œextremistâ€ � politicianâ€ ™ s life story .

2016-02-05,"An image from the cult classic
The Rocky Horror Picture Show is being shared on social media as a photograph of Bernie and Jane Sanders at a 1975 march in support of transgender equality .
The photographâ€ ™ s actual subjects are Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon , with Tim Curry as â€œsweet transvestite from Transsexual , Transylvania , â€ � Dr. Frank - N - Furter .
Spotted outside Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s event in New Hampshire :
Iâ€ ™ m not saying that it rises to the level up Benghazi , Iâ€ ™ m saying itâ€ ™ s the same kind of attitude.â€ � Thatâ€ ™ s one - time Republican presidential frontrunner Ben Carson , telling Buzzfeed that the antics Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign got up to in Iowa are in the same vein as , well , whatever Dr. Carson thinks happened in Benghazi , Libya .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Sam Levin has more on the Las Vegas Review - Journalâ€ ™ s endorsement of Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s presidential campaign : The Las Vegas Review - Journal , now under the ownership of billionaire casino mogul and GOP donor Sheldon Adelson , has endorsed senator Marco Rubio in the presidential race .
The high - profile endorsement comes after months of speculation surrounding Adelsonâ€ ™ s initially secretive purchase of Nevadaâ€ ™ s largest newspaper , with the news organizationâ€ ™ s own staff forced to investigate the identity of their new boss .
The endorsement published Friday afternoon includes a prominent disclaimer distancing Adelson from the decision : â€œThe RJ met with Sen. Rubio on Oct. 9 , two months before the announcement of the newspaperâ€ ™ s sale to the family of Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson .
The Adelsons have detached themselves from our endorsement process , and our endorsement of Sen. Rubio does not represent the support of the family.â€ �
That disclosure , however , is unlikely to quell speculation that Adelson had a hand in selecting Rubio in advance of the Republican caucus in Nevada on 23 February .
The timing of the sale and purchase of the Review - Journal as the 2016 presidential race was heating up sparked widespread rumors that Adelson was interested in using the paper to exert his influence over the race in Nevada , a key swing state .
Adelson donated more than $ 92 m to conservative Super Pacs in an effort to help elect a Republican in the 2012 race .
Adelson has interests in the stateâ€ ™ s gaming and tourism industries as the principal owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation .
Rubio , meanwhile , has aggressively courted Adelsonâ€ ™ s backing , having met with the billionaire several times in Las Vegas and often staying in close contact by phone .
Immediately after the purchase of the Review - Journal , Adelson was silent , leading staffers to demand on Twitter that the buyers disclose themselves .
Reporters at the paper eventually revealed the new owner and Adelson himself published a page - two note saying : â€œIt was always our intention to publicly announce our ownership.â€ �
In a front - page editorial in December , the paper said it would not allow Adelson to skew coverage : â€œWe will fight for your trust .
Every .

The Republican candidates for president , he explained , claim to want less government intervention in the lives of voters , but when it comes to â€œa very , very personal decision that a woman has to make , they love government.â€ �
After the Iowa caucuses , Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign organisation has been accused of electoral dirty tricks .
Jeff Roe , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign manager , has been linked to hardball political tactics before .
Roe , an astute strategist , is often described as Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s David Axelrod , after the adviser who helped guide Barack Obama to the White House .
In a previous role , he was a consultant for Catherine Hanaway , a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Missouri , when her potential opponent Tom Schweich killed himself last year .
Roe was linked to a campaign effort that constantly targeted Schweich personally .
In April 2015 , Roe told the Kansas City Star he paid $ 8,300 for a radio ad which said among other things that Democrats would â€œsquash [ Schweich ] like the little bug that he isâ€ � .
Hanaway , Roe told the Star , â€œknew nothingâ€ � about the ad and â€œhad a very aggressive conversation with me afterwardsâ€ � .
Roe , who also told the paper he was saddened by Schweichâ€ ™ s death , has also been accused of sending staffers to go through rivalsâ€ ™ trash and implying that one rival candidate was a pornographer .
The controversy in Iowa came on caucus night , when Cruz supporters spread rumors â€ “ prompted by a CNN report that Carson would go to Florida after the caucuses for â€œa fresh change of clothesâ€ � â€ “ that Carson was dropping out of the race , and urged Carson supporters to instead back their man .
This effort included calls to Cruz precinct captains on caucus night , encouraging them to share the news with Carson supporters .
The resulting controversy prompted Cruz to apologize to Carson , who in turn held a strange press conference on Wednesday in Washington , at which he condemned Cruz without mentioning his name .
â€œLet me put it this way , â€ � said Carson .
â€œWhen there were things in my campaign I couldnâ€ ™ t agree with after doing an investigation , I made changes .
I think thatâ€ ™ s what a good leader does : if there are things going on that you donâ€ ™ t agree with , you need to make changes .
If he agrees with it , he doesnâ€ ™ t need to make changes.â€ � Cruzâ€ ™ s links to such bare - knuckle tactics could , however , prove a plus among many Republican voters .
There has long been discontent among the Republican base that Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008 held back from getting down and dirty against Barack Obama .
Many base GOP voters hope the party will nominate someone who would engage in â€œno holds barredâ€
� tactics .
With Roe on board , and given the Cruz campaignâ€ ™ s aggressive push on caucus night , it seems clear that is not a complaint that will be levied against the Texas senator .

Hotlines in other countries can be found here The Las Vegas Review - Journal - the most widely circulated newspaper in second - in - the - nation caucus state Nevada - has endorsed Florida senator Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign for the Republican nomination .
In and of itself , the endorsement wouldnâ€ ™ t amount to much more than the endorsement by a local paper of a candidate who performed better than expected in the Iowa caucuses , but given the Review - Journalâ€ ™ s new ownership , the editorial has drawn massive attention .
The newspaper was recently purchased for $ 140 million by Sheldon Adelson , chairman and CEO of casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. and heavy Republican donor .
The support of a newspaper whose editorial operations are coming under increasing scrutiny might indicate that Adelson himself has shifted his favor to Rubio .
Despite the speculation , the Review - Journalâ€ ™ s editorial board has declared in no uncertain terms that its ownership had nothing to do with the endorsement : The RJ met with Sen. Rubio on Oct. 9 , two months before the announcement of the newspaperâ€ ™ s sale to the family of Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson .
The Adelsons have detached themselves from our endorsement process , and our endorsement of Sen. Rubio does not represent the support of the family.â€ �
The reaction to the endorsement on social media has been ... skeptical .
Bruises , reddened marks and bandaged body parts featured in nearly 200 images of US detainee abuse that the Pentagon was forced to release today , the result of a court battle that has lasted more than a decade .
While the American Civil Liberties Union â€ “ which has fought for the publication of the photos of Bush - era torture in Iraq and Afghanistan since October 2003 â€ “ hailed the belated disclosure , it pledged to keep fighting for approximately 1,800 more images the Pentagon continues to withhold , which it believes documents far more graphic detainee torture .
The photos are part of a cache relevant to investigations of detainee abuse at two dozen US military sites around Iraq and Afghanistan , and perhaps GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
Many showed detainees in states of undress having their bodies inspected , with rulers and coins held up for comparison and placement of injuries .

Marco Rubio gains on Trump â€
“ and everything else you need to know today from the campaign trail today .
Marcomentum A trio of polls showed the Florida Republican moving into second place in New Hampshire behind Donald Trump .
Rubio came third in Iowa â€ “ will he ever be first ?
In the Iowa Democratic partyâ€ ™ s chaotic attempt to report caucus results on Monday night , the results in at least one precinct were unilaterally changed by the party as it attempted to deal with the culmination of a rushed and imperfect process overseeing the first - in - the - nation nominating contest .
The shift of one delegate at a county convention level would not have significantly affected the ultimate outcome of the caucus , but rather , it raises questions about the Iowa Democratic partyâ€ ™ s management of caucus night .

A glance at the latest polling numbers from New Hampshire , by data editor Mona Chalabi .
With the New Hampshire primary just three days away , a poll from CNN and WMUR published this morning is particularly interesting .
Itâ€ ™ s based on interviews with 837 adults in New Hampshire before the Iowa Caucuses , and then with 556 adults after the caucuses .
Not all of those individuals said they planned to vote in either primary and the margin of error on these numbers is over five percentage points â€ “ in other words , be cautious interpreting these numbers !
The poll suggests that Sanders hasnâ€ ™ t been harmed by his very narrow loss in Iowa .
The Senator could win 61 % of support in New Hampshire while Clinton is backed by just 30 % of possible voters .
Those numbers are largely consistent with the averages Real Clear Politics creates across dozens polls which also suggest that Sanders has a 31-point lead .
Another poll from NBC / WSJ / Marist poll published yesterday tells a slightly different story .
The 2,551 adults they interviewed on 2 - 3 February gave Sanders a 20-point lead on Clinton .
Finally , a survey from the Lowell Center for Public Opinion suggests that the race is even tighter , with just 15 points between the two Democratic candidates .
Among Republicans , polls published since the Iowa caucus suggest a slight dip in support to Donald Trump but not enough to make a dent in his considerable lead in the state .
An average of all polls currently suggests Trump is 17 points ahead of his closest rival Marco Rubio ( who overtook Ted Cruz two days ago - a trend that might yet be reversed ) .
My colleague Adam Gabbatt has spent a day with Jim Gilmore , meeting voters at a diner and a gun range .
Yes , that very same Jim Gilmore , the famed former Virginia governor and counter - intelligence officer who won 12 votes â€ “ count â€˜em , 12 â€ “ in Iowa .
Never heard of him ?
That wonâ€ ™ t stop Jim Gilmore .
Itâ€ ™ s 8.50am on the last Thursday before the New Hampshire primary , and Iâ€ ™ ve travelled to Rindge , a tiny town in the south - west New Hampshire wilderness .
Iâ€ ™ m there to spend the day with a Republican presidential candidate : Jim Gilmore .
Later on we will visit a shooting range , where he has promised to show me how to fire a gun .
But the first stop is at the Hometown Diner , where Gilmore has planned a â€œretail stopâ€ � , to talk with voters one to one .
Arriving at the diner , Iâ€ ™ m not sure if I am at the right place .
There are no Gilmore signs .
No satellite trucks .
No other members of the press .
There are precisely six people in the diner , eating breakfast and drinking coffee .
â€œHi , â€ � I say , to a woman behind the counter .
â€œIs
Jim Gilmore hosting an event here?â€
� â€œWho?â€ �
â€œJim Gilmore .
Heâ€
™ s â€ ¦ err â€ ¦ running for president.â€ � Bonnie , the owner of the diner , is summoned to the counter .
I repeat the question .
â€œIâ€
™ m sorry
, I donâ€ ™ t know who that is.â€
�
This is a problem .
Gilmore launched his presidential bid last July .
He has been running for the White House for six months .
In that time , he has concentrated almost exclusively on New Hampshire .
Jim Gilmore is a former governor of Virginia .
He is also a former counter - intelligence agent in the US military .
He is 66 years old , is married to Roxane and has two grown children who work in Washington , DC .
His platform is based around â€œthree principle themesâ€ � .
â€œNumber one , â€ � he says , â€œforeign policy .
Number two : veteranâ€ ™ s issues .
Number three : the second amendment .
Gun rights.â€
�
Gilmore says there actually is a fourth theme â€ “
â€œthe economyâ€ � â€ “
but he says he talks about that less .
â€œI have actually made that a signature issue for the last two years
but I just think people are more interested in the first three right now.â€ � â€˜I might have gotten zero
, I might have gotten oneâ€ ™
We meet three days after the Iowa caucus .
Texas senator Ted Cruz won it , with 51,666 votes .
Donald Trump , who led in Iowa polls , has been humiliated , coming in second with 45,427 .
Marco Rubio has enjoyed a last - minute surge to finish third , with 43,165 .
Jim Gilmore got 12 votes .
He did not win 12 precincts , or win 12 delegates .
In a state of 3.1 million people , where 186,000 voted in the Republican caucus , 12 people voted for him .
Whatâ€ ™ s interesting is that Gilmore says he doesnâ€ ™ t mind .
â€œI
wasnâ€
™ t campaigning there , â€ � he tells me .
â€œSo
I might have gotten zero
, I might have gotten one , I might have gotten 12 .
It didnâ€
™ t matter because I wasnâ€ ™ t campaigning there .
â€œIf we had campaigned there we would have done better than 12 votes .
But I wasnâ€ ™ t trying to do that.â€ � â€˜Ooh , move voters back hereâ€ ™
When he arrives at the Hometown Diner , Gilmore works the room in earnest .
He certainly looks like leadership material .
Heâ€ ™ s straight - backed and broad - shouldered , dressed well in dark blue pinstripe suit , pristine white shirt , red tie and shiny black loafers with tassles .
But there is no disguising the fact that there are very few people there , and that none of them have come to see him .
â€œHi folks , Iâ€ ™ m Jim Gilmore , Iâ€ ™ m running for president , â€ �
he says to a middle - aged couple eating eggs .
â€œYâ€ ™ all voters in New Hampshire?â€
�
They are not .
Gilmore disengages himself from the conversation with impressive speed .
He spins 180 degrees and addresses two people in the next booth .
â€œYâ€ ™ all voters in New Hampshire?â€
�
he asks the couple in the next booth .
They are .
But they donâ€ ™ t seem that interested in Gilmoreâ€ ™ s pitch that he is a veteran and that he supports gun rights .
It turns out
thereâ€ ™ s another seating area at the back of the diner .
â€œOoh
, thereâ€ ™ s more voters back here ,
â€ �
Gilmore says .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve seen you on television!â€ � says an elderly woman .
Gilmore tells her he is on the board of the National Rifle Association .
â€œWell , heâ€ ™ s a lifelong member ,
â€ � the woman says , pointing at her husband .
Gilmore tells a young man at the next table that he is the only veteran in the race .
He will say this many times during the day .
â€œWell , I think that should be a requirement , â€ � the man says .
No one commits to vote for Gilmore , but thereâ€ ™ s evidence that his message has appeal .
A success .
You can read the rest of Adamâ€ ™ s account from the front lines of Gilmore - mania down through the link below .
He follows some elderly women home , sees a nerd , shoots guns with Jim Gilmore , and is terrified .
Itâ€ ™ s worth the click .
â€œLive free or die , â€ � is the state motto getting recited by every candidate and their mother ( seriously ) this week , as they all try to persuade voters to their cause .
But one candidate and his fiery , erumpent mane loom over the race , even from New York .
What does New Hampshireâ€ ™ s motto mean to Donald Trump ?
It means so much to so many people .
All over the world they use that experssion .
It means liberty .
It means freedom .
It means free enterprise .
It means safety and security .
It means borders .
â€œWhat a great slogan .
Congratulations , New Hampshire .
Wonderful job.â€ � Donald Trump , though absent from the trail today because of snow , has never strayed far from the heart of Republican politics this campaign season .
He says heâ€ ™ s got no problem with showing up for the next Republican debate , even though host Fox News will include Megyn Kelly , the moderator whose incisive questions so irked him that he skipped the debate right before the Iowa caucuses .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll be there ,
â€ �
Trump told Newsmax on Friday .
â€œI have no objection to being there .
And that had nothing to do with Megyn Kelly , the fact that I went out on that last one .
It had to do with a memo sent out by Fox that was a little taunting.â€

Hillary Clinton has also hit the road in snowy New Hampshire , shadowed by a flock of reporters from around the US .
Sheâ€ ™ s got Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan in her corner , too .
Per the APâ€ ™ s Lisa Lerer : Sheâ€ ™ s pitching young people in this speech ,
Mother Jonesâ€ ™ Timothy Murphy tweets .
Itâ€ ™ s an echo of a line she made in the debate on Thursday night :
that young people should be comforted by her commitment to hear Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ ideas and counsel , if not to follow them word for word .
â€œI want you to know , you may not be supporting me , but I am supporting you , â€ � the Times Amy Chozick quote - tweets Clinton .
â€œWe need to keep our eye on the November election.â€ �
Clinton has argued hard in recent weeks that sheâ€ ™ s the more viable candidate against a Republican in the general election , and in the debate Thursday night framed Sanders as a dreamer , rather than a doer .
The Guardian can confirm : Bernie Sanders plans to appear on Saturday Night Live this weekend .
His campaign manager told reporters by the bus that Sanders will be in New York and is expecting a call from the comedy show .
Larry David is hosting â€ ¦ apparently the campaign enjoys Davidâ€ ™ s impression of the senator as much as David enjoys doing the impersonating .
DC bureau chief is on the Sanders bus as the snow heaps down on all the campaignâ€ ™ s â€ ¦ except Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s .
The billionaire retreated to his Manhattan home for the night , and got stuck in New York when the storm hit New Hampshire .
Dating app Tinder has banned two supporters of Bernie Sanders for campaigning for him instead of looking for a date , Reuters reports .
Two women , one from Iowa and the other from New Jersey , confirmed to Reuters on Friday that they received notices from Tinder in the previous 24 hours that their accounts were locked because they had been reported too many times for peppering men on the site with messages promoting Sandersâ€ ™ candidacy .
Robyn Gedrich , 23 , said she sent messages to 60 people a day for the past two weeks trying to convince them to support Sanders .
â€œDo
you feel the bern?â€ � her message to other Tinder users read , parroting a Sanders campaign slogan .
â€œPlease text WORK to 82623 for me .
Thanks.â€ �
The text would subscribe the user to campaign updates and information about how to get involved .
Gedrich has been unable to sign back into Tinder since logging off on Thursday .
Haley Lent , a 22-year - old , married photographer from Cedar Rapids , Iowa , told Reuters in a Twitter message that she also got locked out of the app on Thursday night after sending messages trying to convince people to vote for Sanders the previous night .
Lent said she talked to 50 to 100 people on the app .
â€œI would ask them if they were going to vote in their upcoming primaries , â€ � she said .
â€œIf they said no or were on the fence , I would try to talk to them and persuade them to vote.â€ �
Tinder didnâ€
™ t immediately respond for comment .
Gedrich said she got 300 users to reply , some of whom had questions , others who thought she was a bot .
None of her matches resulted in an actual date , she said .
Checking in with the Republicans .
Trump says thereâ€ ™ s a big storm .
Tremendous snow .
Event postponed .

DC bureau chief Dan Roberts , in attendance at the emotional debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Thursday night , stopped by WNYCâ€ ™ s Brian Lehrer to share his thoughts on why the match - up was so different from previous , more polite clashes .
Dan jumps in about six minutes in , noting that Sanders is the frontrunner in New Hampshire â€ “ and that Clintonâ€ ™ s strategy was much more aggressive than in the past .
Data editor Mona Chalabi breaks what Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ foreign policy stumble during last nightâ€ ™ s Democratic debate might mean for his standing with voters .
In the last Democratic debate before the New Hampshire primary , Hillary Clinton went on the attack for rival candidate Bernie Sanders .
His weak spot : foreign policy .
That could yet prove a fatal vulnerability , given that many voters say they care a great deal about Americaâ€ ™ s role in the world .
The Vermont senator , who polls predict will easily win New Hampshire next week , appeared out of his depth when pressed about how a Sanders administration would handle foreign policy issues .
Two particular stumbles stand out from last nightâ€ ™ s debate .
First , when asked about the presence of US ground troops in Afghanistan , Sanders replied : â€œwe canâ€ ™ t continue to do it aloneâ€
�
( America isnâ€ ™ t alone in Afghanistan where the NATO coalition is still present , Sandersâ€ ™ answer is far more relevant to US troops in Iraq ) .
Second , when asked whether North Korea , Iran or Russia pose the greatest threat to the US , Sanders said Isis .
Pressed further , Sanders said North Korea , he explained : â€œbecause it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators , or maybe just oneâ€ � .
Clintonâ€ ™ s vote for the Iraq war 14 years ago could also leave her vulnerable , but the former Secretary of State was quick to shift the focus back towards Sandersâ€ ™ inexperience .
â€œWhen New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote , you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief.â€ �
But does foreign policy even matter to those who were watching the debate and making up their minds ?
The short answer is a yes .
Foreign policy might even be the defining issue of this election , if public polling from Pew Research Center is anything to go by .
When US adults were asked about the most important issues facing the country on the eve of the 2012 election , back in December 2011 , 55 % mentioned economic concerns and only 6 % mentioned foreign affairs .
When Pew offered the same options to respondents in December 2015 , only 23 % chose economic concerns , compared while 32 % said foreign affairs .
More specifically , terrorism is a growing concern .
In December 2014 , just 1 % of respondents said terrorism was the most important issue facing the country â€ “ a year later , that had risen to 18 % , likely because of massacres in Paris in November and in San Bernardino , California , in December .
Whether that interest hold through the next 10 months is an open question .
There are clear partisan divides on these issues , too .
Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say that Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear program , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and Chinaâ€ ™ s power are top threats to national security .
By contrast , Democrats are almost as likely to consider global climate change a national threat alongside Isis .
Unless Sanders can build confidence in his ability to handle foreign policy â€ “ or convince Democrats that the economic issues are the most pressing issue facing the country
â€ “ his efforts to reach the White House may face more trouble like what he saw in the debate .
And thatâ€ ™ s it .
â€œPolitics and eggâ€ � convenes .
Donald Trump has cancelled the 12.30pm rally he scheduled .
Hereâ€ ™ s George W Bush , back from the past to endorse his brother Jeb , in whatâ€ ™ s probably his first political ad since he went into hiding and learned to paint .
Sanders is talking about â€œmoose being infested with these ticks , draining the blood out of them , which is horrible , just one manifestation of climate changeâ€ � .
Someone asked about transitioning to biofuels , but your blogger must confess that he missed how Sanders pulled off a segue to moose ticks .
Back to energy : â€œWe can do this , this is not rocket science .
We know what good windows , good insulation can do.â€
�
We donâ€
™
t look at our part of the world as having great solar exposure but actually we are not that different than Germany , we can do it .
The cost of solar panels is plummeting â€
¦
I think climate change is one of the great crises facing our planet and we have got to be extremely , extremely aggressive in taking on the fossil fuel industry and transforming our energy .
Sanders coughs a bit , drinks some water .
Next question is about private vs public college tuition .
Sanders says heâ€ ™ ll help lower costs for private schools too .
â€œHere we are in 2016 .
We live in a wonderful , extraordinary country , â€ �
Sanders says , finally reaching some kind of conclusion .
But thereâ€ ™ s more that needs to be done .
No president can do it alone , we need the involvement of [ all ] people to stand up and help transform this country.â€ �
He drinks some water .
Heâ€ ™ s going to take questions .
Everyone mustâ€ ™ ve finished their breakfast an hour ago .
Heâ€
™ s asked about drug addiction .
You just can not throw these drugs out .
â€
¦
People are getting ahold of these drugs .
Someone fairly close to me .
she was in pain .
Started taking the opiates .
Absolutely became addicted .
He says pharmaceutical companies will have to start looking at the drugs theyâ€ ™ re making , doctors will have to stop over - prescribing opioids , and , the US will have to stop treating substance abuse and addiction â€œnot as a criminal issue but as a medical issueâ€ � .
â€œClimate change is real .
Climate change is caused by human activity ,
â€ �
Sanders says , raising an issue that was neglected in the latest Democratic debate .
Climate change is already doing harm to our country and the world .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got a short opportunity to transform our energy ,
â€ �
he says The planet we will be leaving our children and our grandchildren will be increasingly unhealthy .
Now what is interesting about this debate is that the scientific communitiy is virtually unanimous He makes it personal for New England :
â€œBy the end of this century this planet could be five to 10 degrees warmer than it is today .
That Vermont and New Hampshire could have climates that are similar to Georgia .
And we all know what that means .
It means more floods , more droughts , more rising sea levels , the acidification of oceans ,
â€ ¦ it means more international conflict as people fight over limited natural resources .
Thatâ€ ™ s what we are looking at and that is a tragedy.â€ �
He says heâ€ ™ ll work with China , Russia and the whole world to deal with climate change .
And then he notes that Republican candidates have tried hard to avoid talking about climate change at all .
â€œAre the Republican candidates dummies ?
No , â€ � he says .
â€œWe disagree , to be sure , but they donâ€ ™ t go around attacking cancer researchers .
â€
¦
How does it happen that on this issue they deny science ?
Itâ€ ™ s about money , Sanders says .
â€œThey lose their campaign , the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel â€ ¦
That is just one example of the corrupting impact that campaign money plays on our public policy.â€ �
( Not all the Republican candidates deny climate science ; several agreed in a symbolic vote that climate change is real .
Most , however , say they donâ€
™ t buy human activity causes change , and last December Ted Cruz staged a hearing , with a Canadian jazz vocalist , that attempted to discredit climate science . )
He says he wouldnâ€ ™ t nominate anyone to the supreme court unless he or she is on his side about the rules of campaign finance .
â€œNo nominee of mine will get that position unless he or she makes it publicly clear , crystal clear , that they would vote to overturn Citizens Unitedâ€
�
The supreme court hasnâ€ ™ t always been so fraught â€
“ and justicesâ€ ™ politics havenâ€ ™ t always mattered this much , and still donâ€ ™ t , to a degree , on the court .
Earlier this week chief justice John Roberts lamented how political feuds had tainted coverage of his court .
â€œIn fact , our ruling is that whoever does get to decide this or that is allowed to do it , and that itâ€ ™ s not unconstitutional , that itâ€ ™ s consistent with the law , â€ � he told a law school audience in Boston .
â€œBut we often have no policy views on the matter at all , and thatâ€ ™ s an important distinction.â€ �
Nor does political acrimony change the bonds between the justices , he added , even when antipodes like Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader - Ginsburg sit on the same bench .
The Post wrote up Robertsâ€ ™ speech , if youâ€ ™ d like to read more .
Sanders is rambling , but heâ€ ™ s getting into it .
Heâ€ ™ s talking about the revolving door that links Goldman Sachs and government ,
noting how top executive have landed jobs in presidentsâ€ ™ cabinets and at the top of the Federal Reserve .
Thatâ€ ™ s political power , he says , even as Goldman Sachs paid a $ 5bn settlement with the government .
â€œHow many Wall Street exeuctives will have a police record for destroying the lives of so many Americans?â€ �
He contrasts that story with that of a young man who gets caught with a small amount of marijuana and ends up with a record at minimum , if not also serving some time in jail .
â€œCriminal justice means justice .
It means that if you are poor , if you are wealthy or powerful , you need to be treated the same under the laws of the United States of America.â€ �
He is indefatigable .
The small , polite crowd applauds when he reaches the heart of each of his stump points , but the senator powers on .
â€œI love democracy , I love debate , but I do not love the situation we have today where billionaires can buy elections.â€
�
He goes on to decry the Koch brothers and their $ 900 m spending pledge to support conservative candidates in 2016 .
â€œIt is undermining American democracy.â€ �
Sanders says that over the last year heâ€ ™ s seen a lot of frustration and anger in Americans , over his favorite theme : â€œthe issue of wealth and power that dictates what happens in Americaâ€ � .
When people look at Wall Street what they see is a rigged economy , what they see is a corrupt finance system , and what they see is a broken criminal justice system .
All wrapped up in Wall Street .
He says he was right and Alan Greenspan , the former chairman of the Fed , was wrong .
Sanders spins out the story of how financial firms demanded that DC â€œget government off our backsâ€ � so that they could reinvigorate the economy with their creativity .
They went out and did their thing .
And what a thing it was .
He talks about the financial collapse , and how the big banks came to Washington â€ “ he says theyâ€ ™ re the same people who want to cut social security and Medicare â€ “ and demanded a bailout from the government .
â€œTurns out the three out of the four largest banks are bigger than they were when we bailed them out.â€
� Sanders warns that on its current course the US will have to bail out the banks again , and should re - enact Glass - Steagal banking rules and break up the biggest banks .
â€œWhat I want to see is a financial system that is not an island unto itself , â€ � he says , and whose sole intent is to make money for itself .
I want to see banking become boring again .
Remember boring banking ?
Small business goes to get a loan ?
â€
¦
Helps people buy homes ?
He saves some quiet anger for the Republicans , calling their philosophy of small government alongside â€œfamily
valuesâ€
� a basket of contradictions .
They may want to abolish the IRS and EPA , he says , out of concern for government making decisions in the lives of Americans , but â€œsomehow when it comes to a very , very personal decision that a woman has to make , they love government .
They want the state and the federal government to make that decision â€ ¦ that is hypocrisy , that is wrong.â€ �
He turns the pro - reproductive rights argument into one for paid family and medical leave , and is upfront that it will cost the average American a tax of $ 1.60 a week .
( About $ 83 a year . )
Sanders goes on to his stump speech call for reform of the criminal justice system , noting that the US has more people incarcerated than any other country in the world .
He says heâ€ ™ s glad to note that Republicans are on board with reform
â€ “
he doesnâ€ ™ t
mention that even the Koch brothers have joined the push to reduce prison populations and change how police and prosecutors handle minor crimes .
That might come up at a hearing led by Republicans next week on the issue .
From here he segues into infrastructure investment , saying his plan would create 13 million new jobs .
â€œInfrastructure does not get better if you donâ€ ™ t invest in it .
It doesnâ€ ™ t .
It just gets worst.â€
�
He talks about research by the Society for Civil Engineers , cracking :
â€œwhat a sexy name for those guys.â€
�
He wants a trillion dollar investment : â€œHow do we pay for it ?
Well as some of you know
thereâ€
™ s a large loophole , a large corporate loophole , that allows large multinational corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands.â€
�
Close the loophole , he says .
The senator says that one of the good points of running a presidential campaign was being able to force inconvenient conversations : to â€œget it outside of the soap opera and the baseball game.â€
�
The good news and it is very good news .
When President Bush left office , we were losing 800,000 jobs a month .
Everybody remembers that .
â€
¦
For those people concerned about deficits , we ran up that year the largest â€ ¦ [ more than $ 1tn ] .
There was real fear that you could put a debit card in an ATM and nothing would come out , he says .
But he segues into a discussion of real unemployment , including the hundreds of thousands of people whoâ€ ™ ve stopped looking for work in the years of struggle after the 2008 financial crisis .
Then he says that unemployment for young people is staggering , especially for people without college degrees and African Americans and Hispanic people .
â€œThat is a crisis but donâ€ ™ t you think itâ€ ™ s a little bit amazing that nobody talks about
this?â€ �
Sanders chooses the Walton family , the owners of Walmart , as an example of what he calls â€œthe rigged economyâ€ � .
â€œThe Walton family is the major recipient of welfare in America , â€ � he says .
while their employees are â€œon medicaid , on food - stamps or on subsidized housing - which you are paying for with your taxes.â€ �
He invokes senator Elizabeth Warren , of neighboring Massachusetts , and continues : A rigged economy is when the middle class of this country pays taxes to subsidize the wealthiest family in this country because the wealthiest family in this country is paying [ benefits and wages ] that are too low .
â€œTell me
why in the year 2016,â€ �
he goes on , â€œso many people in New Hampshire , and so many people in Vermont , should be working not one job but two jobs and three jobs , trying to cobble together some income .
â€œThe answer is , of course , wages are too low.â€
�
He gets applause for saying the US needs to raise the minimum wage to a living wage .
To my mind people working 40 hours a week or more should not be living in poverty and too many of them are.â€ �
Bernie Sanders takes the stage in Manchester , New Hampshire .
He remembers the start of his campaign â€œon a beautiful day in Burlingtonâ€ � , when â€œa lot of media pundits were commenting on my hair , on my clothesâ€ � .
A lot has changed in the last nine months .
And I think the reason for that is because we are discussing issues that for a variety of reasons are not often discussed in our country .
He says his campaign is â€œtapping into a feeling of ordinary Americans , that there is something profoundly wrong with a government that seems , every day , to be deeply concerned with the interests of the wealthy and powerful , but somehow ignores working people and the middle class , and seems to pay not attention at all to poverty.â€
�
Sanders seems subdued , not his usual fiery self .
But heâ€ ™ s building up to more familiar levels of Brooklyn indignation as he speaks to the room of breakfast diners .
No president , not Bernie Sanders or anybody else , can bring about the changes we need in this country alone .
That what needs to happen is we need what I call a political revolution .
Which means that millions of people who have given up on the political process , that believe that their vote doesnâ€ ™ t matter â€ ¦ The media is in part to blame , he says , for making Americans cynical about politics .
â€œMedia to a significant degree sees politics as a football game or a soap opera , â€ � he says .
Sanders counters that he sees democratic politics as more akin to going to your doctor .
â€œYou say doc whatâ€ ™ s wrong with me , whatâ€ ™ s the diagnosis , and how do I get better?â€ �
Still waiting on Bernie Sanders to speak at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire , where campaign reporters are getting a taste of New England in February .
This tweet from the Timesâ€ ™ Jonathan Martin .
Ben Carson , the Republican candidate and retired neurosurgeon whoâ€ ™ s won popular support from many evangelicals , has turned all his ire toward Ted Cruz , whose campaign falsely told Iowans that Carson had dropped out of the race .
Carsonâ€ ™ s campaign has uploaded voicemails with the message on YouTube , as a de facto attack ad on Cruz .
The Texas senator has apologized for the maneuver , but his enemies remain outraged by it .
Donald Trump has accused Cruz of fraud , and Iowa governor Terry Branstad threatened â€œrepercussionsâ€ � for the â€œunethical and unfairâ€ � tactic .
Cruz won with 26 % of the vote ; Carson came in fourth , with about 9.3 % , behind Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s 24 % and Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s 23 % .
At a press conference on Wednesday Carson refused even to say Cruzâ€ ™ s name , only suggesting that the senatorâ€ ™ s actions were hardly Christian and spoke for themselves .
Hereâ€ ™ s what a Cruz staffer told an Iowan precinct captain , per the recording :
â€ ¦ from the Ted Cruz campaign calling because youâ€ ™ re a precinct captain , and it has just been announced that Ben Carson is taking a leave of absence from the campaign trail , so
itâ€ ™ s very important that you tell any Ben Carson voters that for tonight that you not to waste a vote on Ben Carson and vote for Ted Cruz .

All right ?
Thank you .
Bye .

The Clinton campaign has a message to Bernie Sanders â€ “ and Iowaâ€ ™ s leading newspaper â€ “ get over it .
Lauren Gambino reports from wintry New Hampshire the day after Clinton and Sanders clashed in person .
Note to the Sanders campaign : Hillary won Iowa .
End of Story .
So writes Matt Paul , the Iowa state director for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign in a Medium post published on Friday morning .
In the post , Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign blasts Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ s campaign for peddling â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€
� about the results of the Iowa caucuses , which Clinton won by an extremely narrow margin .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s been even more bluster than usual from the Sanders campaign , this time in an effort to disqualify Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s historic victory in Monday nightâ€ ™ s Iowa caucus .
â€œDisparaging good news for Hillary Clinton has become a pattern for the Sanders camp .
If you support someone else ?
Youâ€ ™ re dismissed as part of the â€˜establishment , â€ ™ unless of course they want to claim your support in ads anyways .
If a process doesnâ€ ™ t go their way ?
Itâ€ ™ s invalid or flawed or they blame the Iowans who ran it.â€ �
Sanders has not yet challenged the result but his team has asked precinct captains around the state to verify every official count .
On Thursday , the The Des Moines Register editorial board , which endorsed Clinton , called for an audit of the final numbers .
The fire in last nightâ€ ™ s Democratic debate showed Clintonâ€ ™ s
campaign hadnâ€
™ t anticipated such a narrow victory , and such a strong challenge by senator Sanders .
New Hampshire wakes up to a snowy campaign trail .
Bernie Sanders is first up this Friday morning with a â€œpolitics and eggs breakfastâ€ � in Manchester .
Who won the final pre - New Hampshire debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders ?
Richard Wolffe writes about the highs , lows and draws for the candidates .
For once , a televised political debate lived up to its breathless hype .
The first head - to - head debate of the 2016 election cycle on Thursday night was a spirited , direct exchange of personal attacks , policy differences and at times , plain old agreement between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .
Both candidates seemed unusually well - prepared for combat .
Bernie Sanders had combed his normally unruly hair , in perhaps the clearest sign that he is the runaway favorite in New Hampshire .
He also sported an unidentifiable lapel pin : for an anti - establishment candidate , it was an unusually establishmentarian sartorial statement .
Clintonâ€ ™ s preparation was of an entirely different kind : she and her campaign executed several well - planned attacks and counter - attacks on some of Sandersâ€ ™ best - used debate lines .
In her most effective attack , she pivoted away from her own weak spots on Wall Street to a piece of opposition research on Sandersâ€ ™ voting record : he voted twice to deregulate derivatives , which had a far more direct impact on the financial collapse of 2008 than the unwinding of Glass - Steagall separation of traditional and investment banking that Sanders tends to harp on in speeches and debates .
Strangely , Sanders let the attack pass him by without comment .
This was a debate about definitions : about what it means to be â€œprogressiveâ€ � and â€œmoderateâ€ � , and what and whom the candidates represent .
It may even turn out to be a defining debate in what promises to be a bitterly contested â€ “ and protracted â€ “ primary contest .
Clinton called herself â€œa progressive who gets things doneâ€ � and her opponent â€ “ by implication â€ “ as someone who couldnâ€ ™ t get anything done .
â€œI am not making promises I can not keep
, â€ �
she said with a sweet smile .
Within minutes of portraying her opponent as a candidate limited by a myopic focus on income inequality and Wall Street , Clinton was back painting him as a hopeless dreamer .
Still , while under sustained attack â€ “ from both Sanders and the MSNBC debate moderators
â€ “ Clinton conceded that she had responded poorly to questions about the speaking fees she had earned from Wall Street .
â€œI may not have done the job I should have , explaining my record , â€ � said Clinton , in a tortuous fashion .
â€œI did go on the speaking circuit.â€ �
Pushed repeatedly to expand on his foreign policy , Sanders sounded unusually subdued .
When asked about his foreign policy advisers , Sanders demurred .
When asked about his assessment of the risks posed by North Korea , Russia and Iran , he could only offer that he was â€œvery , very worriedâ€ � about North Korea .
Still , there were glimpses of genuine respect between two candidates who offer such contrasting views of what their party should represent .
Bernieâ€ ™ s best moment was his mensch - like refusal to attack Clinton on the saga of her private emails at the State Department , stating publicly that he had rejected repeated media requests to do just that .
If consistency and principle are the hallmark of the Sanders campaign , the candidate reinforced his signature characteristic .
The moderators tried to lure Clinton into a similar attack on Sanders , offering her a chance to get a dig in on the number of apparent ethical questions surrounding Sanders staffers .
But she politely declined the opportunity to jump in .
Such moments are likely to become ever rarer as this primary season continues .
â€œSometimes in these campaigns things get a little out of hand , â€ �
Sanders said near the end of the debate .
At the New Hampshire debate they certainly did , at least for a moment .
How I learned to stop worrying and love The Donald , a meditation by Oliver Burkeman .
Was there some other way to think and feel about this absurd and terrifying man that might actually make a difference â€ “ or , failing that , make it slightly less distressing to see his face pop up on TV ?
I began by asking Gregg Henriques , a professor of psychotherapy at James Madison University in Virginia , to explain whatâ€ ™ s going on inside Trumpâ€ ™ s head .
â€œClassic narcissist , â€ � he said , barely giving me time to finish the question .
â€œHe has this unquenchable drive to demonstrate success , a bottomless pit of need for evidence that heâ€ ™ s the one , the saviour.â€ �
Henriques also suspects that Trump is obsessive - compulsive , with a fixation on cleanliness and disgust .
That figures :
Trump famously hates shaking hands , and there was something odd about the vehemence with which he described Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s visit to the bathroom , during a recent debate , as â€œtoo disgustingâ€ � to discuss â€
“ a discussion about what he wouldnâ€
™ t discuss .
From this perspective , Trumpâ€ ™ s endless insistence that he is a winner isnâ€ ™ t a sign that he is convinced of his greatness , or how widely heâ€ ™ s adored .
Rather , it shows that he isnâ€ ™ t yet sufficiently convinced , and perhaps never could be .
It sounds an exhausting way to live : one imagines his inner world as an exhausting high - wire walk , in which every defeat or insult must be swiftly counterbalanced by seeking a new victory .
Thinking about Trump in this way might not be sufficient to render him sympathetic , but it does make him a little harder to hate .
And if itâ€ ™ s possible to take that view of the candidate himself , itâ€ ™ s surely easier with his supporters .
In Henriquesâ€ ™ s view , the â€œtraditional Christian white malesâ€ � who make up Trumpâ€ ™ s core support donâ€
™ t necessarily believe , in a rational way , that his ideas would help them .
Instead , they are using him to live out a vicarious experience of power as they sense their own slipping away .
This is how politics works , Henriques and many other psychologists argue : weâ€ ™ re attracted to certain candidates and parties for intuitive , emotional reasons that barely register in conscious awareness .
Then , we use our rational minds to construct convincing - seeming arguments for views we already hold .
The tricky part is that you canâ€ ™ t condescendingly think about Trump supporters this way for very long before realising that it must be true for you , too .
â€œIf you look at life like a psychologist , â€ � Henriques said , â€œone of your first principles is : weâ€ ™ re all full of shit.â€ �
Clearly , it wasnâ€ ™ t going to be enough simply to understand the emotional motivations of Trump and his sympathisers ; it was time to up the ante .
So I called Sharon Salzberg , one of the USâ€ ™ s most prominent meditation teachers , to see if she could help me learn to love them .
But all living beings â€ “ really ?
Surely the Buddha reckoned without the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz ?
And anyway , if I became capable of compassion towards all , smiling beatifically upon even the most infuriating wearer of a Make America Great Again baseball cap , wouldnâ€ ™ t I lose my motivation to stand up for whatâ€
™ s right ?
Oliverâ€ ™ s adventures meditating with Trump donâ€ ™ t end there .
Will he find inner harmony ?
Will the search for harmony with Trumpistas drive him to drink ?

Hello and welcome to our coverage of race for New Hampshire â€
“ the second state to vote for president in the election of 2016 .
Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders faced off on Thursday night in their final debate before the primary election next week , and they did not disappoint voters who wanted to see fireworks .
Clinton accused Sanders of an â€œartful smearâ€ � and â€œinnuendo and insinuationâ€ � , over suggestions her speaking fees from Wall Street were a sign that financial firms have her in their pocket .
â€œIf you have something to say , say it , â€ � she demanded , before insisting that she has far more enemies in finance than friends .
Sanders declined to confront Clinton head on over her donors or her use of a private email server while secretary of state , and won applause with impassioned versions of his stump speech on corruption and inequality more generally .
But he struggled on questions of foreign policy , for example calling North Korea a â€œvery , very strange countryâ€
�
ruled by â€œa handful of dictators , or maybe just oneâ€ � .
The senator from Vermont , who leads by 22 points in New Hampshire , according to poll averages , managed to draw some sharp distinctions with Clinton , who leads nationally by 15 points .
They disagreed on the death penalty , on whether their plans were possible , and , angrily , about the meaning of â€œprogressiveâ€ � in 21st century America .
â€œI am not making promises I can not keep , â€ � shot Clinton .
â€œA progressive is someone who makes progress.â€ � Donald Trump leads in the polls of the Republican contest by more than 20 points , according to poll averages , ahead of the senator who beat him soundly in Iowa â€
“
Ted Cruz â€ “ and the senator who nearly beat him for second place , Marco Rubio .
Trump wasted no time denigrating his opponents on the trail on Wednesday , accusing Cruz of fraud .
Iowaâ€ ™ s governor was only too happy to echo the billionaire , saying Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign tactics were â€œunethical and unfairâ€ � .
The remaining Republican candidates are getting a little antsy .
Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich have more or less staked their campaigns on a good showing in New Hampshire .
Theyâ€ ™ ve respectively gotten a single hug , questions about complicity in a corruption case and a guy with a guitar for their trouble ."
2016-02-07,"Donald Trump said he would â€œbring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboardingâ€ � , or simulated drowning , at the Republican debate in Manchester , New Hampshire , on Saturday .
His Republican rival Ted Cruz , asked whether the practice notoriously used under the Bush administration during the war on terror was torture , denied it was : â€œUnder the definition of torture , no , itâ€ ™ s not .
It is enhanced interrogation ...
It does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.â€ �
But the Texas senator added : â€œI would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use .
And indeed Iâ€ ™ d join with Senator [ John ] McCain in prohibiting line officers from employing it.â€
�
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush
â€
“ brother of former president George W Bush , under whom waterboarding was used by the CIA â€ “ said : â€œIt was used sparingly , Congress has changed the laws and I think where we stand is the appropriate place.â€ �
Meanwhile , Marco Rubio said it was inappropriate to discuss interrogation techniques .
The Republican candidates were debating on ABC ahead of the primary on Tuesday .
Trump has a strong lead in the polls , although he lost last weekâ€ ™ s Iowa caucuses to Cruz ."
2016-02-08,"Since 1976 , no candidate has won their partyâ€ ™ s nomination without winning either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary .
That means the pressure is on for anyone not named Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz on Tuesday .
After all , if they donâ€ ™ t win in the Granite State , the odds are low that they will win their partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
However , in a year in which the rules of politics have been turned upside down , itâ€ ™ s possible that this dictum will join the long list of political certainties disproven by Donald Trump .
Currently Trump is heavily favored to win New Hampshireâ€ ™ s Republican primary .
He has led in every single poll in the state since July and his closest rival , Marco Rubio , stumbled in Saturday nightâ€ ™ s debate .
When asked by New Jersey governor Chris Christie to prove that he was capable of more than repeating talking points , Rubio repeated talking points .
Yet , despite that stumble , Rubio is still counting on a strong second - place finish to give him momentum going into the next early state primaries in South Carolina and Nevada .
New Hampshireâ€ ™ s primary is not just about winning â€ “ instead itâ€ ™ s focused on beating expectations .
In 1992 , Bill Clinton famously dubbed himself â€œthe comeback kidâ€ � after finishing second in New Hampshire , nearly 10 points behind rival Paul Tsongas .
However , for the then scandal - ravaged Clinton , it proved enough to propel the campaign forward to the nomination and then the presidency .
In that same year , Pat Buchananâ€ ™ s shock finish behind George HW Bush in the New England state with 37 % of the vote sparked major concerns about Bushâ€ ™ s popularity among his partyâ€ ™ s conservative base .
Yet he faces rivals in the contest to finish second to Trump with Ted Cruz , John Kasich and Jeb Bush lurking behind him .
Cruz finishing second would be a major blow to the establishment wing of the party and a return to the narrative dominating before Iowa that the Republican nomination was a two - man race between Cruz and Trump .
In contrast , both Bush and Kasich have staked their campaigns on a strong performance with a comparatively moderate New Hampshire electorate .
A second - place performance here would give them necessary momentum to carry them into the crucial nominating contests in March .
But Rubio still has the money , organization and establishment support to survive a third - place finish in New Hampshire .
However , it would make his path to the nomination significantly more difficult .
While the Republican contest features an elaborate array of possibilities with its chaotic field of candidates , the Democratic field is much simpler .
Bernie Sanders is expected to defeat Hillary Clinton â€ “ the question is by how much .
The larger the lead for Sanders , the bigger rebuke it will be for Clinton , the Democratic frontrunner who has suffered an unexpectedly stiff challenge from the self - proclaimed democratic socialist .
The next two states in the Democratic contest , Nevada and South Carolina , are both relatively inhospitable to Sanders , and the senator from Vermont needs a strong win on Tuesday to make his case to voters there that he is a better candidate than Clinton ."
2016-02-09,"Donald Trump used his final rally before Tuesdayâ€ ™ s New Hampshire presidential primary to sling a litany of insults at his rivals , raising eyebrows when he repeated an offensive remark from a member in the crowd who shouted that Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s position on waterboarding made him â€œa pussyâ€ � .
As voters began to brave the New England snow , the echo from a rumbustious Trump rally was still rippling across the state .
Voting began shortly after midnight in a handful of remote New Hampshire hamlets and was due to end at 8 pm .
If the polls are correct , in the Democratic race , senator Bernie Sanders , from neighbouring Vermont , is expected to comfortably hold off Hillary Clinton , while presidential ambitions hang in the balance for many in a crowded Republican field .
Trump , who seeks to put a chastening defeat in Iowa behind him , is a clear favorite in what appears to be a Republican battle for second place .
There is no evangelical wave here to lift the Iowa victor Ted Cruz and the so - called establishment candidates are struggling to break out .
Jeb Bush and John Kasich have seen an apparent lift in their support in the closing days , while Marco Rubio does not seem to have gained momentum from a third - place finish in Iowa .
His debate night foe Chris Christie , the New Jersey governor who exposed Rubioâ€ ™ s learned - by - rote lack of spontaneity , goes into election day in dire need of a strong showing to lend any purpose to his campaign .
But it was Trump , the Republican frontrunner for the White House making the headlines again in the final pitches .
He mocked Jeb Bush and said Marco Rubio was â€œsweating like a dogâ€ � during this weekendâ€ ™ s debate .
Turning to Cruz , his reiteration of a vulgarity shouted by a female supporter in the Verizon Center on Monday evening was likely the first time in American history that a major presidential candidate used a phrase widely considered obscene in a televised rally , let alone used the word to refer to his nearest competitor for public office .
Trump was berating Cruz for giving an equivocal answer during the debate on Saturday , when multiple candidates were pressed on whether waterboarding constituted torture and whether any of them would bring it back .
Trump had reiterated that night that he would â€œbring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboardingâ€ � , but on Monday he went after the Texas senator as weak .
â€œThe other night in the debate , â€ � he told thousands in Manchester , â€œthey asked Ted Cruz a serious question : what do you think of waterboarding ?
Is it OK ?
I thought
heâ€ ™ d say absolutely , and he didnâ€ ™ t .
And he said , well , heâ€ ™ s concerned because some people â€“â€ �
A woman near the front of the crowd interrupted .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a pussy!â€ �
Trump admonished her for saying â€œa terrible thingâ€ � .
â€œYou know what she just said?â€ �
he asked .
â€œShout it out , because I donâ€ ™ t want to say it.â€ � â€œYouâ€ ™ re not allowed to say that , â€ � he continued .
â€œI never expect to hear that from you again.â€ �
Trump paused , looked out at his election - eve audience and leaned into the microphone : â€œShe said heâ€ ™ s a pussy.â€ �
The audience cheered â€ “ shouting â€œTrump !
Trump!â€ �
â€ “ before he gave the woman a mock admonishment and returned to his rambling , more than 45-minute speech .
â€œFor the press , â€ � he said , looking up at the television cameras , â€œthis is a serious reprimand.â€ �
During the debate , Cruz had given a hesitant answer on waterboarding as the Texas senator tries to maintain his national security bona fides while appealing to former supporters of libertarian icon Rand Paul .
Cruz insisted waterboarding is not torture so much as enhanced interrogation , then added : â€œI would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use.â€
�
At a December rally in Michigan , he said of Hillary Clinton that she was â€œschlongedâ€ � during her 2008 Democratic primary loss to Barack Obama .
Trump has had other brushes with vulgarity in the course of the campaign as well , pledging to â€œbomb the shit out of Isisâ€ � and implying that he received tough questioning from Fox News host Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate because she was menstruating .
But the use of the phrase â€œpussyâ€ � on air and onstage marked a dramatic change from Trumpâ€ ™ s more passive tone in recent weeks .
He was significantly more mellow on the campaign trail one night before the Iowa caucuses , replacing his standard stumpspeech with question - and - answer sessions led by moderators like the evangelical Jerry Falwell Jr.
After a week of trying to soften his imagefor social conservatives in the midwest , he has returned to his openly confrontational style in New Hampshire , where voters are far more moderate and blue collar .
In a statement , Cruz spokesperson Catherine Frazier told the Guardian this was â€œjust the latest episode of the reality show that Donald has made the 2016 campaign â€ “ letâ€ ™ s not forget who whipped who in Iowaâ€ � .
In addition to insulting Cruz , Bush and Rubio , the frontrunner jokingly dismissed his own voters .
â€œI donâ€
™ t really care if you get hurt or not , I want you to last until tomorrow , â€ �
he said of those struggling with the snowstorm gripping New Hampshire .
In January he said , â€œI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody
and I wouldnâ€ ™ t lose voters.â€
�
He was , however , impressed with the size of the crowd , despite snow falling across New Hampshire hours before voting opened in a state where he has led in every poll since July .
He said there was â€œI wonâ€ ™ t mention names , how many people are at the other candidates
[ rallies]?â€
�
But he did name names , and talked some more about the weather .
â€œGlobal warming ?
We got a blizzard outside !
Thereâ€ ™ s no warming.â€
�"
2016-02-10,"One of lifeâ€ ™ s enduring mysteries is how intent politicians seem to be on ignoring the lessons of history .
One recent example involves torture .
There was once a consensus that torture was immoral ; even today , any sensible person knows torture is of little use if you want accurate information .
Yet the current crop of Republican presidential candidates have been trying to outbid one another with promises of barbarism : Senator Ted Cruz confirmed that he favours simulated drowning , which he classifies as an â€œenhanced interrogation techniqueâ€ � ( EIT ) that falls short of torture .
( The Spanish Inquisition was rather more honest , and called it tortura del agua . )
â€œThe Donaldâ€ � immediately trumped his rival : he would â€œbring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboardingâ€ � .
If we know our history , it should not come as news that torture secures fantastically unreliable information .
Consider just one under - reported example :
Ibn Sheikh al - Libi â€ “ thought by the CIA to be number three in al - Qaida when he was detained in November 2001
â€ “ confessed under torture that Saddam Hussein was in league with al - Qaida in developing weapons of mass destruction .
This â€œintelligenceâ€ � was quoted by President George W Bush as a reason to launch a war , and it was hundreds of thousands of dead people later , and chaos across the Middle East , that the US worked out that al - Libi actually opposed Osama Bin Laden .
It would be easier to learn the lessons of history if we knew what that history was .
In Britain , David Cameron now seems dead set on avoiding an open inquiry .
One reason for a broader â€œtorture debateâ€ � is reflected in a Guardian story detailing a new study on the effects of sleep deprivation : subjects who spent just one night awake were 4.5 times as likely to admit to something they did not do .
Trump would doubtless denigrate this ; his febrile imagination would be focused on more medieval alternatives .
Whether he is right or wrong
â€ “
and he appears often to be
wrong â€ “ experience teaches us that acts that fall far short of torture have drastic consequences .
Indeed , in 2009 , after the birth of my son
Wilf , I was in a US federal court arguing the impact of weeks and weeks of sleep deprivation on one of my clients in GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
If my argument was incoherent , it was because I had not enjoyed much sleep for weeks myself .
Anyone ( except an apparently childless US prosecutor ) will understand this .
Indeed , I had a capital trial where an exhausted parent accidentally put his nine - day - old child into the freezer â€ “ with tragically fatal consequences .
The headline news of the study in the US National Academy of Sciences is that fully 50 % of those who had gone just one night without sleep confessed without any meaningful pressure .
Yet , when we pare away the emotion that surrounds the torture debate , it is important to recognise that eight of 44 subjects ( almost one in five ) who were fully rested confessed falsely as well .
In other words , the mere appearance of authority can extract false information .
The study also notes that those who scored lower on an intelligence test were more likely falsely to incriminate themselves .
Again , this should come as no surprise to anyone who lives in the real world .
I conducted a study of all the prisoners on Mississippi death row some years back , and one - third of them fell within the range of mental disability .
As many as half of the prisoners exonerated off death row in the US had been condemned to death based on a false confession .
In order to illustrate his susceptibility , I once bullied one of my capital clients into admitting that he had assassinated President John F Kennedy .
Sadly , it was not difficult to get him to confess .
Thus , the most important conclusion of the NAS study is that such false self - incrimination â€œis not out of the ordinary and may even be commonplaceâ€
� .
Until we recognise this , we will have little understanding of how deeply flawed our justice system truly is ."
2016-02-10,"Bernie Sanders made history on Tuesday night as he became the first Jewish American to win a presidential primary .
The milestone came just eight days after Ted Cruz became the first Hispanic American to win a presidential nominating contest with his win in the Iowa caucuses .
Sanders , who beat Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire , is not the first Jewish American to run for president .
Both former Pennsylvania senator Arlen Specter and former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman mounted unsuccessful campaigns for the White House in 1996 and 2004 respectively .
The Republican nominee for president in 1964 , Barry Goldwater , was of Jewish descent but was a practicing Episcopalian .
But Sanders is the first Jewish American candidate , not to mention the first non - Christian candidate of any denomination , to win a state in a presidential primary .
However , if nominated , he will not have been the first Jew to receive votes in the electoral college .
Lieberman was Al Goreâ€ ™ s vice presidential nominee in 2000 in his ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign ."
2016-02-10,"In the Republican presidential debate last Saturday , Ted Cruz laid out a dark scenario to demonstrate the need for a beefed - up missile defence system â€ “ the same one Rick Santorum and Ben Carson had raised before him in earlier debates .
He said that North Korea was working on a satellite , which could spell doom for America : â€œAs it would orbit around the Earth , and as it got over the United States , they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set off whatâ€ ™ s called an EMP , an electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the eastern seaboard , potentially killing millions.â€ �
The very day before Cruz spoke , in the tatty , cavernous but crowded Expo Idaho Center in Boise , speaker and entrepreneur Ben Gilmore laid out a much more elaborate version of the same catastrophe .
In his reckoning there were distinct phases and types of EMP attack , a range of dire consequences depending on where you chose to live , rundowns on the technology of attack and response , and details on a range of possible aggressors .
Speaking to a rapt audience at prepper expo SurvivalCon , Gilmore pointed to a projected map showing much of the North American continent swathed in a deep red .
â€œAn EMP bomb 300 miles up gets all of the United States , and parts of Mexico and Canada .
This is the worst - case scenario , and it is the most probable because currently the military model is that if we are struck by a nuclear bomb we are supposed to absorb it.â€
�
The apocalyptic prediction was thus spiced with a factoid that has long exercised millennial thinkers on the right like Joel Skousen â€ “ Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s change to the United Statesâ€ ™ s deterrent posture at the end of the cold war .
This mixture of End Times thinking , geopolitical speculation and rightwing ideology was repeated not only in the other formal presentations , but in conversations on the floor of the Expo Center .
Randy Pons , an otherwise cheerful middle - aged manufacturer of prefabricated fibre - glass survival shelters , darkened as he told me that he worried about Putin .
â€œHe said he would bomb Yellowstone .
Heâ€ ™ s smarter than [
Barack ] Obama.â€ �
Every tapestry of disaster had a visible thread of blame .
And mostly that opprobrium was reserved for liberals , secularists and Democrats .
Back at the podium , Gilmore had massed evidence from all corners of the internet for his projections of disaster , including a 2011 video report from the Christian Broadcasting Network which claimed that Iran would have the capability of a missile - launched EMP attack by 2015 .
He was not just concerned about North Korea â€ “ â€œIran , Russia and Chinaâ€ � are capable of unleashing the same weapons , especially since Obama has been treating them with kid gloves .
When it happens â€ “ and for him itâ€ ™ s not
an â€œifâ€ �
â€ “ he predicts the grid will be down for up to 10 years .
â€œLife will go back to the 1850sâ€ � unless we prepare .
But how ?
First with faith
â€ “
â€œabove all follow Godâ€ � is Gilmoreâ€ ™ s best advice .
But also â€ “ in a stroke of luck â€ “
Gilmoreâ€ ™ s own company , Techprotect , makes â€œFaraday bagsâ€ � in which electronic items can be shielded from electromagnetic pulses .
The company boasts that they are â€œmilitary
gradeâ€ � and can save everything from cellphones to generators .
Wrapping up your gadgets is just one part of the prepper prescription .
Gilmoreâ€ ™ s father , Jim , known on YouTube as ldsprepper , has a well - trafficked channel where he advises on growing food , arming yourself and creating a sustainable , defensible , self - sufficient lifestyle .
Both men â€ “ like most of the vendors on the floor â€ “ are Mormon .
In part this is because Mormons are relatively overrepresented in the intermountain west .
Around a quarter of Idahoans belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS ) , and itâ€ ™ s more like 60 % in neighbouring Utah .
But Mormons also play a central role in the prepper movement because they have inhabited the practice and the mindset longer than anyone else .
Laying aside a yearâ€ ™ s worth of food , water and money in case of emergency is a matter of Mormon doctrine .
The church lays aside communal supplies in so - called â€œbishopâ€ ™ s
storehousesâ€ � throughout the country .
And since the churchâ€ ™ s beginnings , millenarian beliefs have been a constant presence and temptation .
Those beliefs were evident in a speech given by Charla Conove , who offered a presentation heavy with diagrams , astronomical charts , and numerical coincidences , about clues in Mormon scripture , the Book of Revelation , and the heavens concerning the apocalyptic â€œBlood Moon prophecyâ€ � .
This line of thought â€ “ which prophesies the imminent end of the world partly on the basis of astronomical events â€ “ was popularised by Mormon author Julie Rowe .
Belief in the prophecy became so prevalent late last year that the official LDS church was forced to condemn it .
Such thinking raises the stakes immeasurably on the ways in which we differ in politics , lifestyles and belief .
Thereâ€ ™ s not much room for compromise in a mindset that divides the world so starkly between good and evil , and sees the fate of the world at stake in political disagreement .
While survivalism has undergone something of a makeover recently â€ “ with reality shows making it seem like harmless fun , and news outlets insisting that lefties can do it too , the Idaho show showed continuing strong links persist between prepping , religious fundamentalism and the far right .
Other speakers at the conference included David Swickard from the Idaho militia .
Although he tried to distance himself from the actions of the Bundy bunch occupying the Malheur national wildlife refuge in Oregon , he referred to them as â€œpatriotsâ€ � .
He also offered a similar take on the constitution to theirs , and a similar rationale as that given the militia to that of far right groups since the 1990s .
The militia was â€œrecognised in the constitutionâ€ � , it included â€œall able - bodied citizensâ€ � and stood against â€œall enemies foreign and domesticâ€ � , including the federal government .
Itâ€ ™ s not news that the Republican party has moved far to the right during this campaign , and that populists like Donald Trump and evangelicals like Cruz are leading the pack .
And itâ€ ™ s equally unsurprising to see the prepper industry stoke the fears that sell its products .
What is unusual is to see what might once have been seen as a fringe group signalled so obviously by presidential candidates .
Itâ€ ™ s also striking that this stark point of view can draw thousands to a trade show in a provincial city .
Our politics may be being scrambled more thoroughly than we think ."
2016-02-11,"I have no clue how many climate science denial myths a Republican presidential candidate can fit onto the head of a pin , but given these zingers are generally huge itâ€ ™ s probably not that many .
But we do now have some clue how many myths one of those candidates , Senator Ted Cruz , can fit into an eight - minute diatribe .
At least six .
When asked about climate change at recent hustings , Cruz has been delivering a stock set of answers from the Little Book of Climate Change Denial ( not a real book ) .
At one such event in New Hampshire , the representative from Texas delivered a diarrhea - like splurge ( sorry ) of talking points , myths and cherry - picked factoids .
The world isnâ€ ™ t warming â€ “ check .
This is all about government control â€ “ check .
Scientists used to think an ice age was coming â€ “ check .
Every pinhead contains an etching of Al Gore in a loving embrace with a dirty private jet â€ “ no check .
This is not to single out Cruz who , we understand , is currently second in national polls .
The Donald , currently leading in the polls for the Republican nomination , also denies the science of human - caused climate change .
So does third placed Marco Rubio .
Itâ€ ™ s a hat trick .
We know already that denying climate science has become part of the Republican psyche in the United States , but every once in a while itâ€ ™ s worth pausing to remind ourselves just how nuts this situation has become .
These are people who fancy themselves as the leader of the â€œfree worldâ€ � but think every science academy in the world together with the worldâ€ ™ s thermometers , tide gauges and glaciers are all engaged in an elaborate hoax .
Anyway , letâ€ ™ s have a look at Cruzâ€ ™ s Climate Clangers ( this phrase is hereby released under a Creative Commons licence ) .
Antarctic ice Cruz has been using a story from Christmas 2013 to try and make climate scientists look like idiots .
He says : â€ ¦ an exploration ship was sent down to Antarctica to document how the polar ice caps were melting .
And the people who led this exception they believed the computer models that everything would be melted so they headed on downâ€ ¦ .
They had to go and be rescued because they got stuck in the ice .
Cruz is referring to the Australasian Antarctic Expedition , but it has been abundantly clear that the scientists did not think that â€œeverything would be meltedâ€
�
because , as they wrote on their expedition website and Planet Oz has pointed out before , one of their tasks was to investigate why Antarctic sea ice was growing .
I asked Professor Chris Turney , of the University of New South Wales and who led that expedition , about Cruzâ€ ™ s remarks .
The Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013 - 2014 made it clear from the start that we went pole wards to try and refine our understanding of why there is more sea ice in the south .
We most certainly never â€˜believed the computer models that everything would be meltedâ€ ™ .
I fear Senator Cruz has confused which way is up .
As I hope Senator Cruz is all too aware from his time chairing the US Senate Science and Space Sub - Committee , the Arctic is a large ocean surrounded by continents while Antarctica is a continental ice sheet surrounded by ocean .
The two respond to climate change in quite different ways .
Since satellite observations began in the 1970s , the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has suffered a long - term decline and is now at an all time low .
In marked contrast , the amount of sea ice surrounding the Antarctic continent has reached an all time high .
One thing we do know is as the worldâ€ ™ s temperatures continue to climb , weather patterns around the planet are changing and some of the biggest changes are happening in the south .
Stronger winds are shifting sea ice around the Southern Ocean , helping more survive the summer .
But these winds are also causing a big change in ocean circulation that appear to be melting key parts of the continental ice , making surface waters less salty and therefore easier to freeze .
Iâ€ ™ m sure Senator Cruz doesnâ€ ™ t
need reminding that as scientists weâ€ ™ re trained to test ideas , not believe in them .
Another to have made the same claim about Turneyâ€
™ s expedition is conservative commentator Mark Steyn , who is currently being sued by climate scientist Michael Mann .
Steyn made the exact same claim in an article in The Spectator .
Steyn was called to give evidence to a hearing of the US Senateâ€ ™ s science subcommittee , chaired by Cruz .
Next week , Steyn begins a speaking tour of Australia , sponsored by the â€œthinktankâ€ �
the Institute of Public Affairs â€ “ the countryâ€ ™ s prime pusher of climate science denial .
Satellites
When it comes to global temperature readings , Cruz has his laser vision set on the satellite data , which is showing slightly less warming than the temperatures on the ground ( where we live , and grow stuff ) .
Cruz uses this data to claim that global warming stopped 18 years ago .
But even the senior scientist who looks after the satellite data that Cruz likes to cite , says the ground - based temperature measurements are more appropriate when it comes to climate change .
Cruz does not seem so keen to mention those various collections of land - based measurements , which show , for example , that 14 of the 16 hottest years on record have all happened since 2000 .
The hottest year on record was 2015 , but 2016 will give that a run for its money .
Climate science deniers donâ€ ™ t like land - based measurements because they go through various corrective processes .
Some think scientists are doing this deliberately to fiddle the numbers and show warming .
Conspiracy time .
Yet Cruz and others are apparently ignorant of how scientists have to do far more fiddling around with data from satellites .
For an excellent explainer on all this , watch this Yale Climate Connections video .
1970s cooling This one is an oldie but a goodie .
Cruz has been telling people that in the 1970s â€œyou had Liberal politicians and scientists who were talking about global coolingâ€ � and how we were â€œheaded to another ice ageâ€
� .
While itâ€ ™ s true that a few scientists were writing about possible future cooling , a review of research appearing in academic journals found that between 1965 and 1979 there were more than six times as many papers saying the world was warming .
Only seven academic papers in fifteen years were predicting cooling .
Cruz goes on to criticise scientists because they then â€œrepackaged their theoryâ€ � when the evidence suggested they were wrong .
But to suggest that scientists should not change their mind when presented with evidence fundamentally challenging their ideas is a supremely odd idea .
Climate science is like a religion Another favourite of climate science deniers is to suggest that climate science is a religion .
Cruz likes this line too , and seems to be suggesting that someoneâ€ ™ s views should not be driven by a religious belief .
Seems good advice .
Guess who said this ?
Life , liberty , and property , the fundamental natural rights of man are given to every one of us by God , and the role of government fundamentally is to protect those rights .
They changed the name
In New Hampshire , Cruz told an audience : Anyone noticed in the last two or three years the terms magically changed ?
It had been global warming and then suddenly it became climate change .
Ooh .
Conspiracy ?
Not really .
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( my emphasis ) was formed in 1988 .
Was that â€œtwo or threeâ€ � years ago ?
Cruz is trying to suggest thereâ€ ™ s some underlying political motive to change the name because the world isnâ€ ™ t warming ( when it is ) .
But probably the best - known example of politically motivated interference in the language of climate change comes from Cruzâ€ ™ s side of politics .
In 2000 , the influential pollster Frank Luntz wrote a memo to Republicans saying the term â€œglobal warmingâ€ � should be replaced by the â€œless frighteningâ€ � term â€œclimate changeâ€ � .
The memo was based on a report written for energy companies .
Just like magic , this PR advice was adopted by the George W. Bush administration .
Pseudoscience
As a sort of climax to his splurge , Cruz has been saying that climate change is the â€œperfect pseudoscientific theoryâ€ � because it can â€œnever , ever , ever be disproven.â€
�
This is a little bit like saying you canâ€ ™ t disprove that thereâ€ ™ s a small community of genetically modified clown people living on Uranus ( I suggest a quick check with a long - handled mirror ) .
But what would it take to â€œdisproveâ€ � human - caused climate change ?
Well , hereâ€ ™ s a few things .
Youâ€ ™
d have to first overturn the laws of atmospheric physics , and maybe then prove the atmosphere and oceans are not heating up , that the worldâ€ ™ s plants and animals on the move across the world are reacting to something else ( like , say , messages from Uranus ) , that the oceans are rising just because they fancy it and that all the recent record hot years could have just come along by chance .
Shouldnâ€ ™ t be too hard , eh ?"
2016-02-12,"The media shop for Texas senator Ted Cruz , who is engaged in a claws - out fight with mogul Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination , displayed impressive strength and creativity at weekâ€ ™ s end .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s ad folk are not incapable of missteps .
For example , an actor in a new campaign spot , Conservatives Anonymous , used to perform in soft pornography , which the Cruz camp was not aware of until the ad was cut and distributed .
Then BuzzFeed figured out the porn connection :
â€œAmy Lindsay has appeared in films such as Erotic Confessions , Carnal Wishes , Secrets of a Chambermaid , and Insatiable Desires ,
â€ � the website reported .
A Cruz campaign spokesman told BuzzFeed : â€œHad the campaign known of her full filmography , we obviously would not have let her appear in the ad.â€ �
The actor in question is the one who says , â€œMaybe you should vote for more than just a pretty face next time.â€ �
She means that you should not vote for Marco Rubio .
The problem with the group therapy ad comes after a string of ad successes from Cruz , who this week released two video spots attacking Trump and one attacking Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton .
The ads have been praised for a witty allusion to pop culture , in one case , and a devilishly effective line of attack against Trump for his attempt , once upon a time , to use eminent domain laws to clear a widowâ€ ™ s house for a limousine parking lot in Atlantic City , New Jersey .
Cruz is running an ad in South Carolina , where Republicans vote next , that invokes a scene from Office Space , the 1999 ballad of disaffected cubicle life , to tweak Clinton for her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state : Cruz is also running a pair of ads against Trump .
One accuses him of using â€œpower for personal gainâ€ � , telling the story of the widow , Vera Coking , whose house Trump went after in the early 1990s .
The city of Atlantic City condemned the house , but Coking fought back and won .
( She ended up selling the house in 2014 . )
The second Cruz anti - Trump ad features kids playing with a Donald Trump doll .
â€œHe pretends to be a Republican , â€ � one kid says and they all crack up .
Then they smash a dollhouse , bellowing â€œEminent domain !
Eminent domain!â€ � â€œWe
wouldnâ€
™ t tolerate these values in our children
â€
¦
Why would we want them in a president?â€ � a voiceover concludes .
Trump tweeted on Friday that Cruz was â€œthe worst liar , crazy or very dishonestâ€ � and was not behaving in a Christlike manner ."
2016-02-15,"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has threatened to sue Ted Cruz over the senatorâ€ ™ s eligibility for president , saying that unless his rival stops telling â€œliesâ€ � he will take the issue of his birth in Canada to court .
With less than a week to go until the next Republican primary contest in South Carolina , Trump also lashed out at party leaders , making a veiled threat to run a third - party campaign .
The warning came in response to Trumpâ€ ™ s complaint that he had been booed during Saturday nightâ€ ™ s debate because the audience had been stuffed with wealthy donors who opposed his maverick run .
Trump heaped insults on Cruz in both the press conference and statement , calling the Texas senator â€œa totally unstable individualâ€ � , â€œa basket caseâ€ � and â€œunhingedâ€ � .
In a simultaneous statement released by his campaign , Trump said : â€œOne of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore can not be president.â€ �
Cruz , who beat Trump in the Iowa caucuses earlier this month , â€œis lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaignâ€ � .
â€œI learned so much from Iowa and that somebody could be so dishonest , â€ �
Trump said , referring to tactics by Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign in the state .
Hours before the caucuses , Cruz staffers called homes to say , falsely , that opponent Ben Carson had quit the race and Iowans should support Cruz instead .
The campaign also posted official - looking flyers on peopleâ€ ™ s homes that listed neighbors and gave invented â€œvoter
violationâ€ � grades .
Cruz apologized to Carson over the tactics , but Carson has refused to comment .
His campaign later turned recordings of the calls into campaign ads .
Earlier on Monday , the billionaire hinted he may still run an independent campaign for president , despite a pledge he signed last year to stay within the party .
Trump , who was booed at a debate on Saturday , complained that the audience was full of â€œlobbyists and donorsâ€ � whom he accused of manipulating his rivals .
â€œThose tickets were all special interest people .
I know â€ ™
em , â€ � he said .
â€œI signed a pledge but itâ€ ™ s a double - edge pledge , and as far as Iâ€ ™ m concerned theyâ€ ™ re in default of the pledge.â€ �
A spokesman for the Republican National Committee told the Guardian : â€œThe language of the pledge is pretty straightforward.â€ �
The pledge , he said , â€œsimply states the candidates pledge to run as a Republican and support the nominee .
Nothing more and nothing less.â€ � The men and women in the audience were largely at the candidatesâ€ ™ discretion , according to the RNC : â€œEach candidate received 100 tickets which is the largest amount so far .
The candidates as a whole were the largest group of ticket holders.â€ �
But Trump declared said â€œthe pledge isnâ€ ™ t being honored by themâ€ � , without elaborating on what the Republican partyâ€ ™ s obligations would be under the agreement .
He said the debate was â€œa disgraceâ€ � and â€œthe RNC does a terrible jobâ€ � .
In the past two debates , audiences booed Trump repeatedly after tangling with a rival , Jeb Bush , on issues like the Iraq war and eminent domain .
The Trump campaign has insisted that the audiences were packed with â€œdonors and special interestsâ€ � , a claim that has been repeatedly and vehemently denied by party leadership in the RNC .
Trump did elaborate on how he noticed familiar faces out in the crowd , and mimicked how one acquaintance waved and sniggered .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going â€˜boo , boo!â€ ™
And heâ€ ™ s waving at me ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re booing me because theyâ€ ™ re having fun!â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m saying this is crazy !
But I know many of these people , â€ � he continued .
â€œThat was a wealthy room.â€ �
The billionaire has made his independence from lobbyists and donors a central pillar of his campaign , though his claim of a completely self - funded campaign is freighted with half - truths and caveats .
Trump has nevertheless accused his rivals , all active politicians for years and sometimes decades , of being at the beck and call of special interests such as Wall Street and the oil companies .
Trumpâ€ ™ s threat to run as a third - party candidate is unusual since it comes five days before the South Carolina primary â€ “ a state where the Republican frontrunner has a commanding lead in the polls and is expected to win easily .
In his anti - Cruz statement , Trump runs through various accusations levelled by the senator and attempts to rebut them .
â€œWhat Cruz says is incredible , â€ �
he told reporters .
â€œI will bring that lawsuit if he doesnâ€ ™ t apologize.â€ �
Trump raised Cruzâ€ ™
s
birthplace repeatedly before the Iowa caucuses , and cited the opinion of a Harvard Law professor who claims Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility is an â€œunsettledâ€ � question .
Cruz has argued that he is eligible , as was John McCain , who was born in the Panama Canal Zone to two Americans .
In 2008 the Senate passed a resolution confirming McCainâ€ ™ s eligibility , but McCain himself has said Congress should examine Cruzâ€ ™ s status ."
2016-02-15,"The Presidentsâ€ ™ Day live blog of the 2016 race for the presidency is coming to an end : none of the presidential candidates weighed in on where to put the apostrophe .
They said some stuff about each other , though .
Donald Trump threatened to sue Ted Cruz , his Republican rival for the partyâ€ ™ s nomination , over his eligibility and the â€œliesâ€ � recited by his campaign .
Because Cruz was born a dual Canadian - American citizen , in Canada , Trump says his eligibility is in question .
He also called him â€œtotally unstableâ€ � , â€œa basket caseâ€ � and â€œunhingedâ€ � .
Cruz bookended his day with further attacks on Trump , saying the billionaire must be afraid of losing in South Carolina .
He also said that Trump and Marco Rubio do nothing but shout â€œliarâ€ � when anyone looks at their record .
George W Bush emerged from retirement to campaign with his brother , Jeb , in South Carolina .
The former president will headline an event with his brother on Monday night â€ “ his first campaign appearance , and one of his few public appearances , in the seven years since he left office .
Bill Clinton appeared at a campaign event for Hillary Clinton , whoâ€ ™ s spent the the last 16 years of his retirement working as a senator and former secretary of state ( and professional speaker ) .
The ex - president spoke in Palm Beach , Florida , implicitly attacking Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ plan for free college and selling the audience hard that his wife â€œrealizes that black lives matterâ€ � .
And Trump , not content with one headline , also made a veiled threat to run a third - party campaign , even though he signed an agreement to stay within the Republican party .
That pledge , he said , is â€œin defaultâ€ � thanks to the large number of â€œlobbyists and donorsâ€ � at the most recent debate .
The RNC told the Guardian that candidates had the majority of seat tickets .
NB via Garnerâ€ ™ s Modern American Usage : â€œThe spelling with the apostrophe is better and more common .
Itâ€ ™ s also the original spelling .
Until 1971 , Lincolnâ€ ™ s Birthday ( 12 February ) and Washingtonâ€ ™ s Birthday ( 22 February ) were both observed as federal holidays.â€ �
Richard Nixon put â€˜em together and proclaimed â€œthe Presidetnsâ€ ™

Former president Bill Clinton encounters a Trumpista on the trail .
George W Bushâ€

reappearance in South Carolina heralds a new turn in the race : Bush beat out John McCain in the state in 2000 , but itâ€ ™ s been a long 16 years and itâ€ ™ s not clear whether the former president can help his brotherâ€ ™ s fortunes .
Ted Cruz has given his first response to the enfilade of attacks from Donald Trump today .
Heâ€
™ s response is a tweet .
On the campaign trail he offered a slightly less polished response , the Wall Street Journalâ€ ™ s Janet Hook tweets .
Trump has ended the press conference , which featured not only insults for Ted Cruz but two curious answers to policy questions .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
own Ben Jacobs asked about the Voting Rights Act , the heart of which the supreme court narrowly struck down in 2013 .
From Ben : Asked whether Section V of the Voting Rights Act should be reauthorized , Trump said â€œIâ€ ™ ll look into it.â€ � Section V , which was effectively invalidated by a 5 - 4 Supreme Court decision in 2013 , required the federal government to give preclearance to any changes in voting rules and processes in a number of states and jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in elections .
This included South Carolina .
The implicit meaning of Trumpâ€ ™ s response : I have no idea whatyouâ€ ™ re talking about .
Trump was also asked about undocumented people protected by Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s DACA orders , and who are colloquially called â€œDreamersâ€ � .
The billionaire surprisingly said â€œI think itâ€ ™ s great , â€ � but context shows heâ€ ™ s more fond of the dreaming than the deferred deportations .
â€œI want dreamers to come from the United States , â€ � he said .
â€œI want the people in the United States that have children , I want them to have dreams also .
Weâ€ ™ re always talking about â€˜Dreamersâ€ ™ for other people .
I want the children that are growing up in the United States to be dreamers also .
Theyâ€ ™ re not dreaming right now.â€ �
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s attacks on Donald Trump have increased in the last few weeks , as the Texas senator tries to repeat his victory in Iowa with evangelical voters .
My colleague Sabrina Siddiqui reports from Florence , South Carolina Texas senator Ted Cruz unveiled a new ad on Monday attacking Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s prior stance on abortion , as the battle between the two Republican frontrunners heats up before South Carolinaâ€ ™ s evangelical voters .
The television spot opens with ominous warnings about the balance of the Supreme Court â€ “ a subtle reference to the vacancy left in the wake of Justice Antonin Scaliaâ€ ™ s death on Saturday .
â€œLife .
Marriage .
Religious liberty .
The Second Amendment .
Weâ€
™ re just one Supreme Court justice away from losing them all , â€ � a narrator says against the backdrop of imagery of the Court .
It quickly pivots to an interview with Trump in 1999 , in which the real estate mogul insisted he would not outlaw late - term abortions .
â€œIâ€ ™ m very pro - choice , â€ �
Trump says in the clip , a position he repeats when pressed again for his view of late - term abortions .
The narrator returns to declare : â€œWe can not trust Donald Trump with these serious decisions.â€ � Cruz and Trump have locked horns in a bitter contest for the Republican nomination .
Cruz scored a resounding victory in the Iowa caucuses this month , while Trump overwhelmingly won the New Hampshire primary last week .
Cruz has sought to highlight Trumpâ€ ™ s past support for liberal policies , seeking to undercut the idea that he is a true conservative .
Trump , for his part , has recently pointed to Cruzâ€ ™ s support for Chief Justice John Roberts while serving in former President George W Bushâ€ ™ s administration in 2005 .
( Roberts has drawn conservative ire for casting the deciding vote to uphold Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s healthcare law , in 2012 and 2015 . )
Trump holds a commanding lead of 38 % in South Carolina , based on an average of publicly available polling , while Cruz sits in second at 21 % .
Within the Republican field , Jeb Bush has led the charge in questioning Trumpâ€ ™ s conservatism .
The former Florida governor is seeking a comeback in South Carolina , but trails in the polls behind Trump , Cruz and Florida senator Marco Rubio .
Cruz , holding an ardent following among grassroots conservatives , is regarded as better positioned to make the case that Trump is simply not credible as a Republican candidate .
The coming weeks will determine whether or not the Texas senator is able to succeed Trumpâ€ ™ s press conference careens onward .
Heâ€
™ s asked about undocumented people living in the United States , and specifically those called â€œDreamersâ€ � after the executive actions by Barack Obama to protect them from deportation .
â€œI want dreamers to be Americans ,
â€ �
Trump says .
But itâ€ ™ s not all nationalism .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s great , â€ � he says .
â€œI want dreamers to come from the United Statesâ€ �
Heâ€ ™ s asked about race issues .
Barack Obama â€œhas done nothing for African Americans , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œHe got a free pass , and he shouldnâ€ ™ t have.â€
�
What about that defeat in Iowa , a reporter asks .
â€œIf they had a strong leader in Iowa in terms of the Republican Party ,
â€ � the billionaire answers , â€œthey should overturn that election.â€
�
Heâ€ ™ s asked about his veiled threat â€ “ and weâ€ ™ re talking a veil of gossamer â€ “ to run a third - party campaign because of his disputes with the Republican National Committee .
â€œThis happened twice before , â€ � he says ,
â€œand they donâ€
™ t listen.â€
�
â€œThe bottom line is the RNC is controlled by the establishment â€ ¦ by the special interests and the donors â€ ¦ thatâ€ ™ s why the Republican party for president has lost so much for so long.â€ �
Trump insists :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t have donors , I donâ€
™ t have special interests.â€ � â€œTed Cruz is a totally unstable individual , â€ � begins a Trump campaign statement indicating that the billionaire is fed up by what he calls his rivalâ€ ™ s .
In a longwinded , first - person statement Trump goes through Cruzâ€ ™ s attacks point by point and tries to refute them .
He is the single biggest liar Iâ€ ™ ve ever come across , in politics or otherwise , and I have seen some of the best of them .
His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous .
It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much .
Trump statement also goes on : â€œCruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.â€
�
One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore can not be President .
If he doesnâ€ ™ t take down his false ads and retract his lies , I will do so immediately .
Additionally , the RNC should intervene and if they donâ€ ™ t they are in default of their pledge to me .
The statement runs through gun control , the supreme court , etc , and also suggests Cruz is the hypocrite here : â€œCruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against Obamacare twice.â€ �
The billionaire is simultaneously giving a press conference in South Carolina , where he says : â€œwhat Cruz says is incredible .
â€
¦ I will bring that lawsuit if he doesnâ€ ™ t apologize.â€ �
He rants a bit about how Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign called voters in Iowa to falsely say that Ben Carson , another Republican seeking evangelical voters , had dropped out of the campaign .
Cruz has apologized for the tactic ; Carson has refused to say whether he accepts it ( presumably not ) .
Meanwhile Trump responds to Cruzâ€ ™ s criticism of Maryanne Trump Barry , the billionaireâ€ ™ s sister and a federal judge on a powerful appeals court .
This morning Cruz suggested that she , like her brother , is neither a conservative nor to be trusted .
â€œFirst of all my sister has nothing to do with me , â€ �
Trump says .
|First of all sheâ€ ™ s a federal judge at high , high levels.â€
�
He calls her â€œa highly brilliant womanâ€ � who doesnâ€ ™ t want any stories written about her .
â€œSheâ€
™ s very much like me in that respectâ€
�
â€ “
the joke wins laughs .
â€œBy the way my sister was appointed by Ronald Reagan , â€ � he goes on .
â€œElevated
I believe by the Clinton administration , but appointed , I believe , by Ronald Reagan.â€ � Kansas governor Sam Brownback has endorsed Marco Rubio for president , making Brownback the first current governor to publicly support a candidate .
The Rubio campaign announced the endorsement from the ultra - conservative governor .
â€œJust like Governor Brownback , Marco has consistently defended life , small government and free enterprise throughout his career in public service , â€ �
spokesman Jeremy Adlers aid in a statement .
Brownback also released a statement : â€œMarco Rubio has a proven track record of protecting life , defending religious liberty , and undoing Obamacare.â€ � Kansas will hold its caucuses on 5 March , just after the 1 March â€œSuper Tuesdayâ€ � votes in which 13 states will hold their primaries or caucuses .
Brownbackâ€ ™ s endorsement of Rubio is a blow to Ted Cruz , who has courted extremely evangelical voters and whose own hard - right politics are close to the Kansas governorâ€ ™ s .
Brownback has signed three anti - abortion bills since taking office , and last year revoked anti - discrimination protections for LGBT people .
He has also signed one of the biggest tax cuts in the stateâ€ ™ s history , even though the state is hundreds of millions of dollars in debt .
Itâ€ ™ s not clear whether Kansans will listen to Brownback : last fall support for the governor dwindled to 18 % .
Checking in with Florida senator Marco Rubio , whoâ€ ™ s being trailed by my colleague Sabrina Siddiqui in South Carolina .
Rival Republicans have lambasted Rubio for his work with on a bipartisan immigration reform bill , even though it ultimately failed .
Rubioâ€ ™ s trying out his new line of defense : I never wanted that bill to pass anyway .
Also of note is that Rubioâ€ ™ s put all his electoral eggs in the presidential basket .
Heâ€

And finally , Rubio gives his usual gentle takedown of Donald Trump :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t think thereâ€ ™ s any doubt Donald is not a career conservative.â€
�
Like a ghost of campaigns past , George W returns to the trial .
Trump has moved on to a Q&amp;A portion of the event , taking questions from voters .
My colleague Ben Jacobs is in the room and has managed to get a response from the Republican National Committee about Trumpâ€ ™ s hint that he might still make a third - party run .
In a campaign event just outside of Charleston , the Republican frontrunner said that by packing the debate audiences with â€œlobbyists and donorsâ€ � , the RNC was in default of the pledge that Trump signed last year , promising not to run on his own .
A spokesperson for the RNC told the Guardian : Each candidate received 100 tickets which is the largest amount so far .
The candidates as a whole were the largest group of ticket holders .
The language of the pledge is pretty straight forward .
[ It ] simply states the candidates pledges to run as a Republican and support the nominee .
Nothing more and nothing less .
In the past two debates , Trump has been booed by audiences after tangling with rival Jeb Bush on issues like the Iraq War and eminent domain .
The Trump campaign has insisted that the audiences were packed with â€œdonors and special interestsâ€ � , a claim that has been repeatedly and vehemently denied by party leadership in the RNC .
Trumpâ€ ™ s threat to run as a third party candidate is unusual , since it comes five days before the South Carolina primary in which the Republican frontrunner is expected to win easily .
Normally , threats to bolt the party come from losing candidates , not winning ones .
Trump also addressed other topics besides his pledge .
The Republican frontrunner spent much of the event railing against Ted Cruz , whom he called â€œthe most dishonest guy Iâ€ ™ ve ever met in politicsâ€ � and promised , if elected , to advocate for Christians in the United States .
He also insisted he has no problem staying at a Holiday Inn .
â€œI just want clean .
If itâ€ ™ s clean and has a decent bed Iâ€ ™ m happy .
Clean is number one .
â€œ
The billionaire has hinted that his agreement with the Republican party not to run a third - party campaign might not be so agreed on after all .
Trump complains that everybody in the debate room on Saturday was wealthy and powerful â€ “ the lobbyists and donors whom Trump accuses of pulling politiciansâ€ ™ strings .
He says that the debate was â€œa disgrace from the RNC , â€ � using the abbreviation for the Republican National Committee .
He says he signed a pledge , â€œbut the pledge isnâ€ ™ t being honored by them.â€ � â€œThose tickets were all special interest people .
I know â€˜em!â€
�
He says it was surreal to see familiar faces out in the crowd : â€œtheyâ€ ™ re booing me because theyâ€ ™ re having fun!â€ �
Trump says he knew one guy personally : â€œheâ€ ™ s going â€˜boo , boo!â€ ™ And
heâ€ ™ s waving at me ,
â€ �
Trump says , mimicking a little wave and snigger , a sort of Republican donor imp .
Trump says he couldnâ€ ™ t believe it : â€œIâ€ ™ m saying this is crazy !
But I know many of these people .
â€
¦
That was a wealthy room.â€
�
He rhymes , â€œitâ€ ™ s a double - edge pledgeâ€ � , though he doesnâ€ ™ t say explicitly say what the Republican party agreed to do regarding the debate crowd .
Back to the Republican party : â€œas far as Iâ€ ™ m concerned theyâ€ ™ re in default of the pledge.â€ �
He throws in another diss at Ted Cruz : â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got a very unstable guy in Cruz , heâ€ ™ s nuts .
â€
¦
So anyway I have to be very careful.â€ �
Donald Trump is Trumping in Mount Pleasant , South Carolina , talking smack about his rivals to some voters at a Holiday Inn .
Heâ€ ™ s talking about last names .
He prefers a clean , unpunctuated surname : â€œbetter than a hyphen , itâ€ ™ s better than exclamation points.â€
�
â€œWhen
it comes to the other candidates , we will do a job .
Iâ€ ™ m not influenced at all by anything have to do at all with money
, â€ � the billionaire businessman says .
He says that Ted Cruz , Jeb Bush , Marco Rubio et al are the kind of people who hold a Bible in are â€œwilling to lie about anythingâ€ � .
Plus , â€œthey just put up money like itâ€ ™ s
water.â€
�
He says Cruzâ€ ™ s donors in particular are â€œa whoâ€ ™ s whoâ€ � .
â€œTake
a look at the gay marriage issue and then take a look at who is donors are , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œTake
a look at what he said about gay marriage when he was working at law offices in Manhattan .
Somehow or other he segues from the Bible to talk about Christianity , which he says : â€œis being chopped away at : chop , chop , chop.â€ � â€œWe have to give the power back to Christianity , â€ � he says , adding that itâ€ ™ ll be a good thing when it happens .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re gon na say Merry Christmas at christmas â€
¦ cause you canâ€
™ t say it anymore , you canâ€
™ t say it!â€ �
My colleague Ben Jacobs is at the Inn and tweeting from the scene .
Hello , and welcome to our coverage of the race for South Carolina , the third to vote in the 2016 presidential primaries â€ “ and the place where a reclusive ex - president will at last jump back onto the campaign trail .
George W Bush has returned â€ “ his quiet , self - imposed exile of impressionist art ended so that he can help his brother , Jeb ! , in one of the most chaotic Republican primaries in modern history .
Billionaire realty star Donald Trump remains at the top of the polls , in South Carolina and nationally , despite falling into traps laid by Texas senator Ted Cruz in a debate on Saturday night .
â€œAnd Donald has this weird pattern , when you point to his own record he screams , â€˜Liar , liar , liar , â€ ™ â€ �
Cruz said , attacking Trump over his erstwhile liberal feelings .
Trump walked into it .
â€œYou probably are worse than Jeb Bush , â€ � he said ,
adding : â€œThis guy will say anything , nasty guy .
Now I know why he doesnâ€ ™ t have one endorsement from any of his colleagues.â€ �
But Trump has strolled into disasters before and walked out unscathed .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , on the other hand , is still trying to calculate a recovery from mistakes made in New Hampshire .
The once ascendant senator is back to basics in South Carolina , alongside the stray candidates in the field : Ben Carson and John Kasich .
( Jim Gilmore , whom we all remember fondly vaguely , also quit . )
Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has also brought her family to the frontlines â€ ¦ with mixed results .
Her husband Bill , who helped secure his own presidency by telling Americans â€œI feel your painâ€ � , has claimed to feel your race too .
â€œUnless your ancestors , every one of you , are 100 % , 100 % from sub - Saharan Africa , we are all mixed - race people , â€ �
he told a crowd in Tennessee on Sunday .
Clintonâ€ ™ s rival , Bernie Sanders , has meanwhile ramped up operations in Nevada , where he hopes to put up stronger numbers than the southern states where he is not as well known .
Clinton has her partisans there too , however : a group calling itself â€œHookers for Hillaryâ€ � is now stumping for the former secretary of state .
My colleagues Ben Jacobs and Sabrina Siddiqui are in South Carolina with the campaigns , and weâ€ ™ ll be bringing you all the updates of the day ."
2016-02-16,"Donald Trump has one of the smallest and least organized ground campaigns in Nevada , according to Republican officials and operatives in the state , raising questions about the billionaireâ€ ™ s readiness for another caucus - based contest after his disappointing second - place finish in Iowa .
Texas senator Ted Cruz beat the brash real estate mogul in Iowaâ€ ™ s Republican contest with help from evangelical Christians and a superior network of volunteers ; such workers are critical in states such as Nevada and Iowa , which choose their presidential nominees through a complicated caucus system .
Eight days after his bruising loss , Trump won the New Hampshire primary , declaring : â€œWe learned a lot about ground game in a week.â€ � The big question is whether he has learned enough .
Although the answer wonâ€ ™ t become clearer until the Republican caucuses in Nevada on 23 February , following the South Carolina primary on Saturday , the reality television star appears to be lagging behind his better organized competitors in reaching out to Nevadaâ€ ™ s hard - to - corral caucus - goers .
â€œElections are won on organization , â€ � said Adam Khan , chairman of the Washoe County Republican Central Committee .
â€œTrump has a lot of popularity , but if you look at the ground operation here , he just doesnâ€ ™ t have it.â€ �
Exhibit A :
Trumpâ€ ™ s rally on 10 January at the downtown Reno Ballroom .
It could have been a campaign managerâ€ ™
s dream â€ “ 3,000 or so cheering supporters , an energized army ready to be harnessed
, a data trove for the all - important get - out - the - vote effort .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s staff did not record e - mail addresses or phone numbers that day from the captive audience of potential donors , caucus - goers and volunteers .
The rally became a squandered opportunity six weeks out from the caucuses .
When asked about that campaign blunder , Trumpâ€ ™ s Nevada state director Charles Munoz replied : â€œIâ€ ™ ll have headquarters get back to you , or Iâ€ ™ ll get back to you.â€ �
So far , that has not happened .
Organization is everything in a caucus state like Nevada , where voter turnout is among the lowest nationwide , even during a simple election .
Caucuses by nature are time - consuming and complicated .
During the 2012 GOP caucuses , only around 33,000 showed up at their local precincts to meet with neighbors , argue over the best man for the job and pick a winner ; GOP turnout was a dismal 8 % .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul was the first Republican to visit the Battle Born State in the current presidential cycle , not that it did him much good : he dropped out of the nominating race in the wake of a disappointing fifth - place finish in Iowa .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is believed to be the first Republican candidate to open an office here in Washoe County , the only swing county in the only swing state in the west .
But it is Florida senator Marco Rubio who has filled Renoâ€ ™ s airwaves with campaign ads and regularly trots out his Nevada bona fides to anyone who will listen .
From age 8 to 14 , Rubio lived in Las Vegas , where his father tended bar at Samâ€ ™ s
Town and his mother cleaned rooms at the Imperial Palace .
â€œThe best organization goes to Marco Rubio ,
â€ �
Republican political consultant Erik Jimenez told the Guardian .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s got a large number of campaign staff in Las Vegas and Reno .
Theyâ€ ™ re doing a lot of outreach to the rural counties , which are tremendous in terms of who shows up on caucus day , much higher rates than in urban areas.â€ �
When asked which campaigns have active Nevada headquarters , most political experts and operatives interviewed in Nevada rattle off the same five :
Bush , Cruz , Rubio , Trump and ex - neurosurgeon Ben Carson .
Rarely mentioned was Ohio governor John Kasich , a very long shot for the nomination despite his second - place finish in New Hampshire ; his spokesman said he has offices in both Reno and Las Vegas .
On Thursday evening , the last night the campaigns could urge Nevadans to register for the caucuses before a Friday deadline , the Reno offices of Republican presidential candidates gave something of a measure of the relative dedication of their respective campaigns .
Only four of the top candidatesâ€ ™ Reno offices were staffed .
Bushâ€ ™ s office was busiest , with six young volunteers manning phones .
Rubioâ€ ™ s headquarters had half that number .
A man , a woman and a little boy held down the fort for Trump ; they brusquely escorted a reporter out with a curt :
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not allowed to speak.â€
�
A lone man was visible at Cruz campaign headquarters .
Carsonâ€ ™ s office was locked and silent .
Its glass doors were outlined in blue neon and bore a sign imploring visitors to â€œPlease Knock .
Even if Door is Locked .
Carson for President Team.â€ �
Knocking roused no - one .
The Carson headquarters sits at the center of a strip mall , which it shares with a vape shop , a video poker venue and Minute Loan .
Richard , who works in the shopping complex but would not give his last name , said he visited Carsonâ€ ™ s office one day and â€œthere was just a guy sitting at a desk who didnâ€ ™ t talk much , didnâ€ ™ t offer me any promotional material .
Not much of a campaignerâ€ � .
Jon Ralston , who has written about Nevada politics for a quarter century , says Bush , Rubio and Cruz have the best organizations here as judged by the operatives who run their campaigns .
Bush hired Ryan Erwin , who helped guide Mitt Romney to a Nevada victory in 2008 and 2012 .
Rubio hired Mike Slanker , who worked for Nevada governor Brian Sandoval , the landslide victor in 2010 and 2014 .
Slanker also advised lieutenant governor Mark Hutchison , a prominent Mormon and Rubioâ€ ™ s Nevada campaign chair .
Cruz has campaign organizations in Nevadaâ€ ™ s 17 counties and has been endorsed by Adam Laxalt , the state attorney general who was elected in 2014 .
Laxalt was the first statewide official in 100 years to win without carrying Nevadaâ€ ™ s two population centers â€ “ Clark County , home to Las Vegas and 72 % of the stateâ€ ™ s residents ; and Washoe County , home to Reno and 15 % of Nevadans .
So what else is left ?
Rural Nevada , where residents trend conservative and faithfully show up at polling places and caucus sites .
In recent weeks , Laxalt has stumped for Cruz in far - flung towns including Elko and Winnemucca , Yerington and Fernley , Eureka , Ely and Gardnerville .
â€œA lot of voters in Nevada feel burned by what happened in the 2014 legislative session , â€ � said Robert Uithoven , Cruzâ€ ™ s state director .
â€œFor the first time in anyoneâ€ ™ s lifetime , we had all Republican majorities ( in the state legislature ) and Republican constitutional officers , and what did we do ?
Pass the largest tax increase in Nevada history.â€
�
Cruzâ€ ™ s message of campaign conservatism ( like the Republican elected officials who pushed through a $ 1.1bn tax hike ) versus consistent conservatism ( like his own ) plays well in Nevada , Uithoven said .
â€œWe might not have the most expansive paid staff and ground game in Nevada , â€ � Uithoven said .
â€œBut I believe we have the voters and grassroots on our side.â€ �"
2016-02-16,"Ted Cruz was forced to pull a campaign ad after it was discovered that one of the actors in the video had previously appeared in soft pornography , while his Republican presidential rival Marco Rubio announced that it was â€œmorning in Americaâ€ � with a clip of Vancouver , Canada .
But Rubio and Cruz are far from the only presidential hopefuls to run advertisements featuring flubs or misinformation .
Hereâ€ ™ s a look at some of the ads their competitors on both sides of the aisle are currently running , many of which are even more problematic .
A recent clip promoting John Kasich suggests that he is capable of cramming an entire sleeve of Ritz crackers into his mouth and then whistling the Battle Hymn of the Republic â€ “ a feat that Kasich has repeatedly failed to pull off on the campaign trail and throughout his time in office as governor of Ohio .
Last month , an advertisement released in hopes of reviving Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s floundering presidential campaign mistakenly included Bush family home video of the teenage Jeb getting both of his hands caught in mousetraps , then getting both feet caught while trying to free himself .
A new television spot promoting Bernie Sanders to younger voters begins with Sanders claiming he is capable of performing a flawless frontside nose grind on his skateboard , but then in the ensuing ad Sanders only pulls off a few 50 - 50 grinds and a sort of sloppy kickflip .
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s famous 3 am video from 2008 , which posited that Clinton was the best and most experienced candidate to handle any emergency situation that might befall the American people , suggested that Clinton occasionally sleeps , something that has recently been disproved by one of the 26 congressional committees investigating Benghazi .
As the committee explained at a rowdy press conference on the steps of Capitol Hill and in a 482-page report on the subject , Clinton does not sleep .
It is true that she must occasionally be plugged into a recharging chamber , but she is never actually unconscious at any point in that process .
Dr Ben Carson , onetime frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination , has released several advertisements targeting Doozers , those little green creatures from the television series Fraggle Rock .
In the ads , which Carson self - financed , he refers to the Doozers as â€œthe adorable backbone of the American infrastructureâ€ � and promises to keep them safe from Gargamel â€ ¦ who discerning consumers of childrenâ€ ™ s entertainment might know is actually the nemesis to the Smurfs , which is a completely different show .
Donald Trump has released several videos claiming that he is the only candidate who can â€œmake America great againâ€ � .
Although that is indisputably true , the commercials also suggest that Trump is a human man , and not â€ “ as is actually the case â€ “ a mass of orange clay molded into human form and given life through that ectoplasm from Ghostbusters 2 that responds to negative emotions .
A recent advertisement released only in Canada and Cuba by Cruz suggests that if he became president , his Canadian birthright and Cuban parentage would automatically make him prime minister of Canada and president of Cuba too , leading to a union - of - the - crowns - style merging of the US , Canada and Cuba .
In fact , Cubaâ€ ™ s president RaÃºl Castro has not yet agreed to this proposal ."
2016-02-16,"While Marco Rubio took the stage inside a barn flanked by two South Carolina lawmakers who like him were once seen as the future of the Republican party , two hours south - east in North Charleston Jeb Bush focused on the past , with his brother George W Bush joining him for the first time on the campaign trail .
The candidates jockeying to emerge as an alternative to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have struggled to break through in a primary season that has thus far rewarded anger over optimism , and a failure to win over South Carolinaâ€ ™ s conservative electorate might cause the race to winnow down to a two - man contest between deeply polarizing figures regarded as unpalatable by the partyâ€ ™ s top ranks .
In searching for ways to seal the deal with those voters still willing to give them a look , Rubio and Bush arrived in the state attempting to create sharper contrasts to underscore what is at stake , focusing on their opponentsâ€ ™ lack of civility , dirty campaign tactics and , in Trumpâ€ ™ s case , perceived lack of religious conviction .
â€œI promise you , if youâ€ ™ re a parent , you are not going to have to put your hands over the ears of your children at any time today , â€ �
Congressman Trey Gowdy told a couple hundred people who had packed into a barn on a tree farm in Gilbert to see Rubio .
The crowd , recognizing immediately the reference to Trumpâ€ ™ s recent headline - grabbing use of profanity , hooted in agreement .
When Rubio grabbed the mic moments later , he looked anything but diminished despite a disappointing fifth - place showing in New Hampshire .
Criss - crossing the state with Gowdy and Senator Tim Scott in tow , Rubio hit the trail encouraged by positive reviews for his most recent debate performance on Saturday â€ “ a much - needed return to form after his now - infamous encounter with New Jersey governor Chris Christie in the previous debate .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a reason I get attacked by every other Republican , â€ �
Rubio had explained to voters at an earlier town hall in Rock Hill .
â€œBecause we draw voters from them , because we can speak to every part of our party.â€
�
The Florida senator emphasized what he said was a 15-year record of applying conservative principles in public service .
And , on the other side of town , George W Bush similarly touted his brother Jebâ€ ™ s conservative bona fides as the candidate continued to attack Trump .
George W Bush echoed his brotherâ€ ™ s criticism of the Republican frontrunner on Monday , telling the crowd : â€œI understand Americans are angry and frustrated .
But we do not need somebody in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration.â€
�
The elder Bush brother also rejected the label of â€œestablishmentâ€ � that his brother â€ “ along with Rubio and Ohio governor John Kasich â€ “ has been identified as belonging to .
â€œIf being president of the United States makes me part of the establishment , â€ � Bush said , â€œwell , I proudly carry that label.â€ � Quoting his father , former president George HW Bush , he added : â€œLabels are for soup cans.â€ �
Cruz and Trump are riding high after resounding victories in Iowa and New Hampshire , respectively , and Trump is leading the polls in South Carolina , with Cruz second .
At the other end of the spectrum are Jeb Bush and Kasich , facing an uphill battle in terms of resources and the ability to expand their appeal among the more conservative wing of the party ; Kasichâ€ ™ s decision to start the week campaigning in the more moderate terrain of Michigan instead of South Carolina seemed to be an acknowledgement of this .
Meanwhile Rubio , seeking to revive the momentum he lost in New Hampshire , continued to claim a spot somewhere in between .
Despite his disappointing performance in that primary , the senator insists he is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap within the party and win the general election .
Speaking to reporters aboard his campaign bus on Monday , Rubio took aim at both Cruz and Trump as candidates whose support has a ceiling . â€œTed is not someone who can bring the party together ; heâ€ ™ s not someone who can grow the party , â€ � Rubio said , adding of Trump : â€œHeâ€ ™ s obviously got a message
thatâ€ ™ s resonated with some people ... but ultimately you also have to be able to unite our party .
â€œWe have to be able to take our conservative principles â€ “ not water them down â€
“ but convince more people to vote conservative.â€
�
He echoed one of his themes from the stump , warning voters what the consequences might be if the party allowed itself to be engulfed by â€œRepublican - on - Republican violenceâ€ � rather than keeping its sights focused on retaking the White House after eight years .
â€œWe can not lose this election , and we can not win if we are divided against each other , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThe Democrats would pay us to continue to fight against each other well into October .
When I am our nominee , I will bring the party and the conservative movement together.â€
�
Blair Shropshire , a voter who came to see Rubio in Rock Hill on Monday morning , was mostly convinced .
For him , it was down to the Florida senator or Kasich â€ “ even if the governor was not competing strongly in the southern states .
â€œHe has a very good track record in Ohio , and I like his unifying message , â€ � Shropshire said , while adding his appreciation for the fact that neither Kasich nor Rubio appeared to attack their rivals unless prompted .
â€œI think Rubio has the best shot of defeating Hillary
[ Clinton],â€ �
he said .
â€œI
just hope he can overtake Trump and
Cruz.â€ �"
2016-02-16,"Donald Trump has upped his attacks on his Republican rivals at a rally in South Carolina , describing Ted Cruz as â€œa very dishonest personâ€ � and launching a bizarre rant about Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s â€œexcessive sweatingâ€ � .
Trump didnâ€
™ t mention his earlier threat to sue Cruz at the event in Greenville , but again characterized the Texas senator as â€œunstableâ€ � before accusing Marco Rubio of a level of perspiration that would cause problems for diplomacy .
â€œWhen we get in with Putin we need people that donâ€
™ t sweat , â€ � Trump said .
His remarks were received by a packed house , however some supporters were literally left out in the cold after being moved to a drafty overflow room that lacked chairs and a large - screen TV .
The discontent in the bowels of the TD convention center went unnoticed by Trump , who delivered a 45-minute speech focusing on his familiar topics of immigration , walls , and the ability to negotiate .
The Republican frontrunner targeted Cruz as â€œa liarâ€ � during a riff on drug prices .
He again called Cruz â€œunstableâ€ � during a section of his speech discussing the recent GOP debate .
Trump also attacked Rubio , whom he accused of excess sweating during the recent Republican debate .
â€œI thought he just came out of a swimming pool ,
â€ �
Trump said of the Florida senator .
He said that Rubioâ€ ™ s perspiration could make foreign relations difficult .
â€œCan you imagine Putin sitting there and waiting for the meeting and this guy walks in and heâ€ ™ s like a wreck ?
â€œNo , you got to have Trump walk into that meeting folks , weâ€ ™ ll do very nicely.â€
�
About 10,000 people were in the TD convention center , according to some reports .
During his speech Trump said some 3,000 supporters had been turned away from the ticket - only event .
He mentioned there were â€œsomething about the same amountâ€ � of people downstairs â€ “ in the overflow area .
The reality was rather different .
By the end of his speech there were perhaps 200 people still in the area .
Trump had mentioned in his speech the possibility of doing a second speech to those turned away .
But , when his speech finished , those in the overflow room hurried for their cars .
And , unlike Rubio , they werenâ€ ™ t sweating after their experience in the cold convention center basement .
â€œI think this is a joke .
We feel so disrespected .
There is no way I would vote for him now , â€ � said Sharon Jacobs , an erstwhile Trump supporter from Greenville .
She had purchased her ticket days earlier but arrived to be told the center was already full .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never seen anything so poorly put together , â€ �
she said .
Jacobs had come to the event with her sister - in - law Linda Dezzi , who was similarly unimpressed .
â€œI know who wonâ€ ™ t be getting my vote ,
â€ �
Dezzi said .
The pair left rather than watch Trumpâ€ ™ s speech .
Lisa Searfoss had travelled from Piedmont and was unhappy with Trump .
â€œIâ€ ™ m pissed off at him now ,
â€ �
she said as she left just as his speech began .
Asked what she intended to do , Searfoss said : â€œLook at some of the other candidates.â€ �
Searfoss said she had booked her ticket for the Trump event two weeks ago .
She did not think the overflow area had been well organized .
â€œItâ€ ™ s smaller than the TV Iâ€ ™ ve got at home ,
â€ � she said ."
2016-02-16,"President Obamaâ€ ™ s special envoy for climate change has warned Republican presidential hopefuls including Donald Trump and Ted Cruz that any attempt to scrap the Paris climate agreement would lead to a â€œdiplomatic black eyeâ€ � for the US .
Speaking to journalists in Brussels , Todd Stern also said that a recent supreme court decision to block Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s clean power plan would not affect US climate pledges , or plans to formally sign up to the Paris agreement later this year .
Republican candidates such as Trump or Cruz who query climate science on the presidential stump would in practice be â€œvery loatheâ€ � to set off the storm that would follow any ditching of the Paris accord , Stern argued .
â€œParis as an agreement has such broad acceptance and support around the world from countries of every stripe and region and Paris itself was seen as such a landmark - hard - fought , hard - won - deal that for the US to turn around and say â€˜we are withdrawing from Parisâ€ ™ would inevitably give the country a diplomatic black eye , â€ �
he said .
â€œWhen President Bush took the US out of Kyoto â€ “ which in retrospect was in fact a quite flawed document - he took lots and lots of diplomatic flak and that , I think , would pale in comparison to what would happen if a president took us out of Paris , which is seen as a strong viable structure that all countries have now bought into.â€ �
Trump , the current frontrunner in the Republican race , described President Obamaâ€ ™ s speech to the Paris climate summit last December as â€œone of the dumbest statements Iâ€ ™ ve ever heard.â€ �
And Cruz , who won the Iowa caucus , has promised to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement , describing Obamaâ€ ™ s focus on securing a global accord as â€œnuttyâ€ � .
EU sources say that there is â€œsignificant concernâ€ � in Brussels about the possibility of either candidate winning the election in November .
â€œI think everyone is a bit worried about what might happen next , â€ � one official told the Guardian .
â€œEveryone wants to make sure that we arenâ€ ™ t left alone in a deal we all negotiated together.â€
�
The EU is anxious to avoid a Kyoto protocol - type situation where it was the only significant global player obliged to make emissions cuts , after the US and others failed to join in .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a sense that if the US did not join [ Paris ] it might discourage other major economies like China and possibly India and Brazil from joining , â€ �
the source said .
International attention has been focused on the recent US courtâ€ ™ s blocking decision which , if sustained , could cast doubt on at least a third of the emissions cuts promised by the US government in Paris .
Diplomats in China and India have even questioned whether the deal could survive the reassessment of US commitments that this would entail .
Stern pointed out though that the death of the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia earlier this week created the possibility of a â€œmore than slight change to procedural postureâ€ � in the supreme court .
There is currently a 4 - 4 balance between liberal and republican judges on the court benches , with President Obama expected to try to appoint a ninth judge in the spring .
â€œIt is hard to tell how this is going to play out , but the supreme court is in a different place right now , â€ � Stern said .
He maintained though that the US government had anticipated litigation over its power plant emission cuts - if not the legislative stay granted - and was confident in the underlying strength of its position .
â€œWe think we are going to prevail in the court
but we are going to go ahead and sign the agreement this year .
Period .
And we are not in any way going to back away from our 2025 targets , â€ � he said .
References to a capping of global warming a 1.5C in the Paris text were â€œnot a requirement , but a kind of urging , â€ � Stern stated .
The US state department has begun an internal conversation about the domestic measures needed by 2050 if the US is to play its part in making this happen .
A formal review may begin later this year ."
2016-02-17,"The simmering feud between Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz intensified in dramatic fashion on Tuesday , as accusations were hurled between the two senatorsâ€ ™ campaigns over â€œunderhanded tacticsâ€ � and an alleged â€œsmear campaignâ€ � ahead of the critical South Carolina primary on 20 February .
Rubio and Cruz , senators from Florida and Texas , respectively , are locked in a heated battle to overtake the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
While they have increasingly sparred over issues such as immigration and national security , Rubio has in recent days sought to undercut one of the pillars of Cruzâ€ ™ s candidacy : trust .
Speaking with reporters over lunch in Summerville , Rubio said Cruz was being deliberately dishonest with the American public .
â€œThis has been a pattern now with Ted , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œHe has spent the last two weeks literally just making stuff
up.â€
� â€œI just think itâ€ ™ s very disturbing [ that ] you can just come and make things up about people and believe no one is going to call you out on it .
And itâ€ ™ s now become a pattern , so we have to clarify that we canâ€
™ t let that stand unchallenged.â€ �
Rubio added that Cruz had misrepresented his position on a host of issues , including immigration , funding for Planned Parenthood , and same - sex marriage .
Cruz and his allies have launched a series of attacks against Rubio aimed at portraying him as insufficiently conservative â€ “ even though Rubio holds one of the most conservative records in the US Senate .
By Tuesday evening , Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign spokesman , Alex Conant , was blasting Cruz in a fundraising email with an aggressive subject line : â€œTed Cruz is a liar.â€ � â€œFirst it was lying about Marco on fundamental issues like life and marriage ; now Cruz and his supportersâ€ ™ attempts to slander and distort Marcoâ€ ™ s record have reached a new low , â€ � Conant wrote .
One ad by a pro - Cruz Super Pac was pulled down on Monday after a legal review determined it to be misleading in its charge that Rubio supported
so - called â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ � while shepherding a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 .
Cruz also asserted that his Senate colleague shied away from standing at the forefront of the fight to defund Planned Parenthood , even though Rubio has voted numerous times to strip the womenâ€ ™ s health organization of its federal funding .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign also believes members of Cruzâ€ ™ s team to be behind a post that appeared on Facebook this week under the guise of Trey Gowdy , the influential South Carolina congressman who is backing
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign .
The account , Trey Gowdy Prayers , appears to falsely speak on behalf of the Benghazi committee chairman as switching his allegiance to Cruz after determining his support for Rubio was â€œa grave
mistakeâ€ � .
Gowdy , who is campaigning across South Carolina with Rubio this week , called on Cruz to formally rebuke the tactics in a statement on Tuesday .
â€œIn the last week , we have seen a systematic effort by Senator Cruz and his allies to spread false information and outright lies in the hopes of winning votes by appealing to our lowest common denominator , â€ �
Gowdy said in reference to the Facebook incident .
â€œIâ€ ™ m demanding that Senator Cruz and his campaign repudiate these dishonest and underhanded tactics .
We can have a debate about the future of our party and our country .
But we need not leave our integrity behind.â€ �
Gowdy will also feature in new robo - calls released late on Tuesday to counter what he says are deceptive tactics by Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign .
â€œI want to alert you to the fact that voters are receiving dishonest push - polls smearing my friend Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s conservative record , â€ � Gowdy says in the call , which according to time.com will reach 500,000 South Carolina phone numbers .
While there is no direct evidence linking Cruz operatives to the misinformation , maneuvers of the sort are not uncommon in the rough - and - tumble of South Carolina politics .
In his conversation with reporters on Tuesday , Rubio implied that it would not be out of character for Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign to engage in such tactics â€ “ referring back to the night of the Iowa caucuses when Cruzâ€ ™ s staffers spread false rumors that retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was dropping out of the race .
â€œWhat theyâ€ ™ ve been willing to do as part of their campaign
â€
¦
I think people arenâ€ ™ t going to like it the more they learn about it , â€ � Rubio said .
Rick Tyler , a spokesman for Cruz , said Rubioâ€ ™ s efforts to undermine their campaign would ultimately fail .
â€œTeam Rubio is coordinating a smear campaign , â€ �
Tyler said in a statement to the Guardian , citing the vast ground game that helped Cruz secure an overwhelming victory in the Iowa caucuses and chalk up a stronger - than - expected third - place finish in New Hampshire .
â€œMarco Rubio has resorted to name - calling and smear tactics because he canâ€ ™ t defend his record .
He doesnâ€ ™ t have a similar ground game and wonâ€ ™ t have enough money to compete in all the 1 March states like we will , so he thinks he can smear his way to winning .
But it wonâ€ ™ t work.â€ �
Cruz is nonetheless being targeted not only by Rubio but also by Trump , who holds a commanding lead in South Carolina .
In protest of a Cruz ad that highlighted the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s past as being pro - choice on abortion , Trump on Monday threatened legal action against Cruz while referring to him as â€œa totally unstable individualâ€ � .
â€œHe is the single biggest liar Iâ€ ™ ve ever come across , in politics or otherwise , â€ �
Trump said in a statement .
â€œIt is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s unclear if the knocks on Cruz , whose campaign banners bear the word â€œTrusTEDâ€ � , will stick .
At a Cruz rally in a national guard armory in Columbia , attendees dismissed the criticism as part and parcel of politics .
Voters said they were accustomed to dirtier tricks associated with the Palmetto Stateâ€ ™ s political landscape and were unlikely to be fazed .
One ardent Cruz supporter named Steve , who declined to be identified further because he was skipping work to attend the event , said it was â€œshameful on Rubioâ€ � to cry foul over what he said was fairly standard practice in a tough election .
â€œThis is beneath him , â€ � he said .
Tony Burks , an undecided voter from Columbia , said it was â€œjust part of the game right
nowâ€ � .
â€œYou got ta have your big - boy pants before you come in , â€ � he added ."
2016-02-17,"Ted Cruz dared Donald Trump to sue him over a negative campaign ad on Wednesday .
In a press conference before a campaign stop in Seneca , South Carolina , Cruz said he would welcome a lawsuit from his fellow Republican presidential candidate over a campaign ad that the Texas senator recently started airing in the state .
The ad features footage from a 1999 interview of Trump with Tim Russert in which the New York real estate mogul said : â€œI am very pro - choice.â€ � Cruz , holding a cease and desist letter from Trumpâ€ ™ s lawyers , said : â€œMr Trump you have been threatening frivolous lawsuits for your entire adult life .
Even in the annals of frivolous lawsuits this takes the cake .
And so , Donald , I would encourage you , if you want to file a lawsuit challenging this ad , claiming it is defamation , file a lawsuit.â€ �
The Texas senator , a constitutional lawyer who has argued before the supreme court , said that the end result of a lawsuit from Trump over the ad would be â€œDonald Trump and any lawyer that signs his names to the pleadings being sanctioned for frivolous litigationâ€ � .
The ardent conservative expressed his befuddlement that â€œan ad that plays video of Donald Trump speaking on national television is somehow defamationâ€ � .
Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œown words said on national television are public record and repeating someoneâ€ ™ s own words can not be defamation , â€ � he added .
In a statement , the Cruz campaign insisted that it would now air the ad with greater frequency .
In a statement after Cruzâ€ ™ s presser conference , Trump upped the stakes .
The frontrunner said of his rival : â€œHe is a liar and these ads and statements made by Cruz are clearly desperate moves by a guy who is tanking in the polls - watching his campaign go up in flames finally explains Cruzâ€ ™ s logo .
â€œI am
pro - life and I do not support taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood as long as they are performing abortions.â€ �
Trump added : â€œIf I want to bring a lawsuit it would be legitimate .
Likewise , if I want to bring the lawsuit regarding Senator Cruz being a natural born Canadian I will do so .
Time will tell , Teddy.â€ �
The Trump statements from the Cruz ad came in 1999 when he was flirting with a presidential campaign as the candidate of the Reform party .
Since then , the real estate mogul has changed his position .
Trump said in the August presidential debate said that his shift occurred because â€œfriends of mine years ago were going to have a child , and it was going to be aborted .
And it wasnâ€ ™ t aborted .
And that child today is a total superstar , a great , great child .
And I saw thatâ€ � .
In a statement on Tuesday , Trump said : â€œI am a conservative person and I believe in conservative values .
Like Ronald Reagan , on many issues , I have evolved .
I am pro - life and have been for a long time.â€
�
The legal battle marked the latest escalation in the ongoing feud between Trump and Cruz .
Trump has repeatedly questioned Cruzâ€ ™ s eligibility to run for the presidency and has repeatedly accused the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign of engaging in dirty politics .
On Monday , Trump issued a statement calling his rival â€œa totally unstable individualâ€ � .
The real estate mogul said of Cruz : â€œHe is the single biggest liar Iâ€ ™ ve ever come across , in politics or otherwise , and I have seen some of the best of them .
His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous .
It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.â€ �"
2016-02-17,"After being battered on national security in Iowa by Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz is taking no chances in the ultra hawkish state of South Carolina .
Proclaiming that he wants a military with â€œmore tooth and less tailâ€ � , Cruz went on a statewide tour on Tuesday to tout his national security credentials .
Starting with a speech on board the USS Yorktown , a decommissioned aircraft carrier from the second world war , the senator from Texas laid out an approach that relied on beefing up the US armed forces with occasional doses of red meat for social conservative voters .
In a campaign stop in Columbia , Cruz pledged to increase the US armyâ€ ™ s enlistment by 75,000 troops as well as add more ships to the navy and more planes to the air force .
However , he made clear that these additional soldiers would be mostly men , casting scorn upon those Republican rivals who want to â€œdraft our daughters into combatâ€ � .
He said that when the subject of women in combat was brought up at a recent debate , he felt like he had â€œentered the Twilight Zoneâ€ � .
Cruz asked the audience : â€œHave we lost our facilities ?
Is political correctness so all - consuming that weâ€ ™ re not willing to say that thatâ€ ™ s just nuts?â€
�
The senator went on to state that if he is elected to the White House â€œthe time of the military being treated as a cauldron for social experiments is overâ€ � .
Cruz went to express scorn for â€œplush - bottomed bureaucratsâ€ � and insist â€œno longer is the focus going to be on gluten - free MREsâ€ � .
Cruz also veered into second world war analogies , pledging to restore a bust of Winston Churchill to the White House and comparing Barack Obama to Neville Chamberlain .
To him , the Iran deal was similar to the Munich agreement of 1938 with Obama promising â€œpeace for our timeâ€ � .
Cruz , an ardent critic of the deal , then went on to compare Iran to Nazi Germany :
â€œWhen you allow psychotic maniacs to assemble the tools of murder and warfare it does not work out well for the free world.â€ �
He also tried to contrast his fitness to be commander - in - chief to that of his closest rival , Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
Cruz poked at Trumpâ€ ™ s active presence on social media , saying : â€œWhen radical terrorists declare jihad on us , the answer is not to tweet insults .
The answer is to unleash the holy wrath of the United States.â€ � Cruz , though , is still running behind Trump in South Carolina .
Recent polls have the real estate mogul with a 15- to 20-point lead over the senator from Texas in the crucial first - in - the - south primary .
However , Cruz did come from behind to beat Trump in the Iowa caucuses earlier in February , and his campaign is hoping that his push on national security in a state with significant military presence can help accomplish that feat again ."
2016-02-17,"Some quick evaluations of the performances by Ben Carson , Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz :
Ben Carson had the benefit of being the first candidate on the state tonight , with a fresh audience in both the room and in TV Land .
He was commended by moderator Anderson Cooper and by audience members for his even - keeled temperament and affect , but the candidate , already polling far below the top tier in South Carolina , may have been cursed by his own affability on a question about replacing the late Antonin Scalia on the supreme court .
â€œI probably would take the opportunity to nominate someone , â€ � Carson said .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily mean that person is going to be acted on or confirmed .
Why not do it?â€ �
Carsonâ€ ™ s lamentation about the destructive nature of partisanship is noble , but will do little to endear him to conservative South Carolina primary voters who dread the prospect of Barack Obama replacing Scalia - a justice of whom Ted Cruz later said : â€œWhat Ronald Reagan was to the White House , Scalia was to the supreme court.â€ �
Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s pushback against Barack Obama - who , it bears noting , is not a candidate for the Republican nomination - on the issue of immigration was a momentary lapse in focus in what was otherwise a good night for the Florida senator .
The high point , at least in terms of combating the # MarcoBot stereotype Rubio has been fighting , may have been his comments on race and racism in America , mentioning his childhood in Las Vegas during the Mariel boatlift .
â€œWhether you agree with them or not , if a significant percentage of the American family feels that they are being treated differently than anyone else , we have a problem then we have to address that as a society and as a country , â€ � Rubio said about racism .
â€œI do not believe we can fulfill our potential as a nation unless we address that .
Iâ€ ™ m not sure there is a political solution to that problem , but there are things we can do.â€ �
Ted Cruz started out strong , deftly ignoring attempts by Cooper to goad him into attacking Donald Trump head - on and putting his Harvard law degree to good use in detailing why his Canadian birth doesnâ€ ™ t preclude him from the presidency .
But a mind - numbingly long answer on his history of antagonizing congressional colleagues in the US Senate - at least , I think thatâ€ ™ s what the original question was about - shifted dangerously close to the same stump - speech autopilot that Rubio has faced such intense criticism for .
Cruz later talked about the importance of â€œhaving funâ€ � on the campaign trail - he might want to take his own advice next time .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for
tonightâ€ ™ s
coverage of the first half of CNNâ€ ™ s Republican town hall .
Weâ€ ™
ll be back tomorrow for part two , as well as on Friday , Saturday , and every day until the sweet release of Election Day in November .
Ted Cruz said : â€œBarack Obama , in the first weeks of his administration , sent the bust of Winston Churchill back to the United Kingdom .
If Iâ€ ™ m elected president , Winston Churchill is coming back.â€
�
WHAT DOES THIS
EVEN MEAN ?
THIS IS LIKE LISTENING TO A RADIO SHOW YELL
A BUMPER
STICKER AT A PRINTOUT OF AN EMAIL FORWARD .
COULD THIS BE ANY MORE TRIFLING AND STUPID ?
[ Ed note : The bust was loaned to then - President George W Bush by then - Prime Minister Tony Blair and returned as a matter of protocol .
A separate bust of Churchill , given to then - President Lyndon B Johnson , remains in the White House today . ]
Would it kill Republicans to crack a joke ?
Actually , some of them , I think it might .
â€ “ Ted Cruz , on the need to â€œlet looseâ€ � on the campaign trail .
Which cabinet position would Cruz fill first ?
â€œIt would be a three - way tie between secretary of state , secretary of defense and attorney general ,
â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œWhen it comes to defense , we have to begin rebuilding our military immediately .
When it comes to state ... moving the embassy to Israel tells Israel , it tells our allies , it tells our enemies that America is back.â€ � â€œWe need someone strong , someone who represents this country , â€ �
Cruz says of a potential secretary of state .
â€œA secretary of state in a Cruz administration would be someone like John Bolton.â€ �
As for an attorney general , Cruz declares that â€œthe lawlessness of the Obama administration has been one of the saddest legaciesâ€ � .
â€œThe only fidelity of the department of justice will be to the laws and constitution of the United States , â€ � Cruz concludes .
This is a strange election season in many ways .
â€ “ Ted Cruz , on being called a liar by Marco Rubio and Donald Trump Ted Cruz , who sits on the Senate judiciary committee , tells Anderson Cooper that he would not endorse a committee hearing on whomever Barack Obama nominates to fill the supreme court seat formerly occupied by the late Antonin Scalia .
â€œThey should notâ€ � get a hearing , Cruz says .
â€œFor
80 years , it has been the practice that the senate has not confirmed any nomination that has occurred during an election year ...
I donâ€
™ t think it would be fair to the nominee.â€ �
Earlier Cruz was asked about Obamaâ€ ™ s planned visit to Cuba .
Is that something he would do ?
It is not as long as Castro is in power .
And I will say I was saddened to hear that [ but ] I wasnâ€ ™ t surprised .
This was foreshadowed for a long time .
â€œThe law under the constitution and federal law has been clear from the very first days of the republic , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œThe child of a US citizen is a US citizen by virtue of birth.â€ � â€œI was a citizen by birth by virtue of my motherâ€ ™ s citizenship ...
it was the act of being born that made me a US citizen , â€ � Cruz says .
Of the possibility of Donald Trump suing him on the matter - â€œyou can never write off the possibility of Donald Trump suing you , â€ �
Cruz says - â€œif he wants to file a lawsuit , he can file it and lose.â€
�
Ted Cruz thinks that the fluctuations in the oil market are created by fiat currency and thinks that a dollar tied to a fixed amount of gold is a stable dollar that would level out fluctuations in the oil market .
That is a really interesting economic idea with nothing that could contradict it apart from , say , the history of America in the 19th century .
â€œOur relationship with Saudi Arabia is , as you know , fraught with complications , â€ � Ted Cruz says .
â€œWhen it comes to Saudi Arabia , we need ot have real scrutiny and real pressure.â€
� â€œThey are not seeking our interests - they are seeking their monetary interests ,
â€ �
Cruz elaborates .
To combat the â€œstrangleholdâ€ � foreign nations have on American energy , Cruz says , we need to develop American - sourced energy sources .
â€œThis country is blessed with abundant natural resources ... but you shouldnâ€ ™ t have government picking winners and losers .
There shouldnâ€ ™ t be any subsidies.â€ �
Ted Cruz said tonight â€ “ incorrectly â€ “ that Trump had said George W Bush should be impeached during the last debate .
He said : â€œTo see , on a Republican presidential stage a candidate suggesting that we should have impeached George W Bush , that really draws into question the judgement of that candidate to be commander in chief .
But , though Trump attacked W Bushâ€ ™ s record at the last debate ( and said in 2008 that he wouldâ€ ™ ve been happy to see Pelosi impeach Bush ) , he actually deliberately avoided suggesting he ought to have been impeached .
Perhaps Cruz was banking on most South Carolinians having skipped it ?
( And , yes , it seems like one could spend all night fact checking Ted Cruz . )
A pastor asks Ted Cruz about the â€œgrowing threatâ€ � against religious values in the United States , an area of particular focus for the Cruz campaign .
â€œWe are seeing an assault on Judeo - Christian values , we are seeing an assault on religious liberty , and we need a president who will stand up and protect those values , â€ �
Cruz says , declaring that candidates should be held to a higher standard than just parroting pro - life , anti - gay marriage statements .
â€œYou shall know them by their fruits , â€ �
Cruz quotes the Bible , referencing his history of fighting Planned Parenthood in court and protecting a statue of the ten commandments in front of the Texas capitol .
â€œIn June of last year we saw a decision from the supreme court that was nothing short of tragic ...
I think
thereâ€
™ s
something really wrong when Republican candidates are echoing the talking points of Barack Obama.â€
� â€œWhen
it comes to religious liberty , if Iâ€ ™ m elected president I intend on the first day I enter office to instruct ...
every government agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends
today.â€ � â€œWe will not be drafting our daughters into the front lines ...
Iâ€ ™ m the father of two daughters .
Women can do anything , but the idea that the federal government could forcibly conscript women into service doesnâ€ ™ t make any sense.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s like Cruz is saying Women can do anything , except this one thing , for no reason I can come up with , because I said so , and theyâ€ ™ re women .
Unless heâ€ ™ s just objecting to people being drafted into combat , in which case , please condemn that happening to men , too .
Because I am a lazy man , and there is no United States Army Nap Battalion .
When asked about Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s assertion at the last Republican presidential debate that George W Bush didnâ€ ™ t keep the United States safe because the 9/11 terror attacks happened under his watch , Ted Cruz questions Trumpâ€ ™ s judgment .
â€œI thought it was ridiculous , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œListen -
I like Donald .
I am not gon na engage in personal attacks - but his policies donâ€ ™ t make sense.â€ �
Why does Ted Cruz think that saying â€œradical Islamic terrorismâ€ � does anything to stop terrorism ?
Itâ€ ™ s so exhausting hearing the Beetlejuice theory of military policy .
How many times do you have to say it for it to work ?
Do you have to say it really loud ?
Do you have to say it in a mirror , with the lights off , holding a candle ?
Who then defeats the terrorists ?
Is it Bloody Mary or The Candyman ?
Also , itâ€ ™ s just such a funny argument to make from someone who has to constantly distort the record to advance his points .
If naming something what it actually is magically solves problems , itâ€ ™ s puzzling that Cruz is so averse to telling the whole truth and nothing but in many other circumstances .
After saying that he will â€œshamelessly waffleâ€ � and not decide between Clemson and South Carolina , Ted Cruz is asked by an undecided voter about his wifeâ€ ™ s potential role in a Cruz administration .
â€œSheâ€
™ s got a real heart for economic development , â€ �
Cruz says , in part because of her background as the child of Christian missionaries and in part because of her role as a managing director at Goldman Sachs .
â€œHeidi has a real heart here in America ... empowering them to achieve the American dream.â€ �
On Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s assertion that the majority of inmates at GuantÃ¡namo return to terrorism , the director of the National Counterterrorism Center told a Senate panel on 5 February that only 6 of the 88 detainees released by Obama are â€œdirectly involved in terrorist or insurgent activitiesâ€ � .
But when it comes to detainees released by George W Bush , heâ€
™ s right .
Read more about the actual facts on GuantÃ¡namo detainees at The Guardian
: Ted Cruz said that Planned Parenthood had been â€œimplicated in multiple federal feloniesâ€ � as a result of the debunked Center for Medical Progress videos .
Itâ€ ™ s factually untrue : a federal judge ruled in December 2015 that there was no evidence of a crime on the tapes .
In January 2016 , a Texas grand jury impaneled to investigate Planned Parenthood instead indicted filmmaker David Daleidan and Sandra Merritt on charges related to tampering with government records and the purchase and sale of human organs .
There has never been an administration more hostile and antagonistic toward Israel than this administration .

Ted Cruz is the only panelist at tonightâ€ ™ s town hall to come down hard on Anderson Cooperâ€ ™ s repeated question about whether Apple should be compelled to create a backdoor for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to enter the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters .
â€œAnytime
youâ€ ™ re dealing with issues of security and civil liberties , youâ€ ™ ve got to strike a delicate balance , â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œI think we can walk and chew gum at the same time.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ll confess -
I laughed out loudâ€ � when I saw Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s letter threatening to sue me , Cruz says .
â€œThis letter really pressed the bounds of the most frivolous and ridiculous letters Iâ€ ™ ve ever seen ,
â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œHis argument in the letter is running his own words in the ad is defamation.â€ �
Anderson Cooperâ€ ™ s first question : â€œHow does it feel out there for you?â€ �
â€œLook
, it feels fantastic ,
â€ �
Cruz says , asserting that heâ€ ™ s rebuilding the â€œReagan coalitionâ€ � of voters .
â€œWe won among conservatives , but we also won among evangelicals .
We won among Reagan Democrats and we won among young people.â€ �
At the close , Cooper and Rubio had an interesting exchange about football , which Rubio played when he was young .
Back then , he admitted , they taught you to tackle with your head , which he admitted ( to laughs ) that the Democrats would say explains everything you need to know about Rubio .
But , in reply to Cooperâ€ ™ s question about the dangers of football , he mentioned that his daughters do competitive stunt cheerleading , and he drives a car .
Both those things have risks .
Thatâ€ ™ s true !
Unfortunately , as anyone whoâ€ ™ s done either know , brain damage from both ensues when something goes horribly wrong : CTE - related brain damage in football , even without tackling with anything at all , begins accruing on every play during the natural , normal execution of the game .
Football fans know this .
It was a silly answer to give , especially considering that even serious and informed football fans are flummoxed about what to do .
Simply throwing up his hands and saying , â€œWe need to try something!â€ � would have worked .
But just note that , on the spot , Rubio defaulted to toeing the party line and the empty rhetoric of billionaire management .
No .
No !
Iâ€ ™ ve never been to a rave !
Itâ€ ™ s a Republican primary , Anderson !
â€ “ Marco Rubio , on his fondness for electronic dance music .
Responding to Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s comment that heâ€ ™ s â€œbehaving like Donald Trump with a smile , â€ � Rubio laughs .
â€œDonald smiles !
Iâ€ ™ ve seen him smile!â€ �
Rubio says .
â€œUltimately , itâ€ ™ s not about me , itâ€ ™ s not about Ted , itâ€ ™
s not about Donald , itâ€ ™ s about what this countryâ€ ™ s gon na look like when my 15-year - old daughter graduates from college.â€ �
â€œWhen the stakes are that high , â€ �
Rubio continues , â€œthatâ€ ™ s what Iâ€ ™ m going to spend 99 % of my time talking about.â€
�
An undecided South Carolina voter asks Marco Rubio about Ronald Reaganâ€ ™ s history of being , compared to the contemporary Republican field , more moderate on immigration , particularly refugee resettlement .
â€œPolicies have to reflect the times in which you live , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œIn America , there was a time where nobody locked their doors .
Now everybody locks their doors .
Itâ€ ™ s not because we hate the people outside of our homes -
itâ€ ™ s because we love the people inside of our homes.â€ � â€œIf
we accept 10,000 , and 9,999 of them were good people , and one of them was an Isis killer ,
weâ€ ™ d have a big problem , â€ � Rubio elaborates .
â€œIf we donâ€
™ t know who you are , and we donâ€
™ t know why youâ€ ™ re coming ...
weâ€ ™ re not going to be able to let you come , because the threat is so real.â€

The most important job I will ever have is not to be president of the United States - it will be father to my four children .
â€ “ Marco Rubio
On the recent supreme court vacancy , Marco Rubio reaffirms statements he has made criticizing Barack Obama for going forward with plans to nominate a replacement for the late justice Antonin Scalia in an election year .
â€œI would respect that precedent , â€ � Rubio says , referring to disputed claims that a new justice has not been nominated and confirmed in an election year in eight decades .
â€œBottom line is , there will be someone filling that vacancy
and I think the new president should be filling that vacancy.â€
� Rubio was asked about law - enforcement discrimination against African Americans and gave a really empathetic answer .
He talked about having a young African - American friend who has been pulled over seven times and never given a ticket ; he wondered what that friend is supposed to think or friend is supposed to do .
Rubio says that when a member of the American family feels persecuted , we have a problem .
You could tell that heâ€ ™ s thought about this .
You felt like you were on the verge of seeing him connect with something â€ “ with the idea that there is systemic oppression and harassment of African Americans , even .
It seemed like he was about to have a breakthrough .
Instead , he said : â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure thereâ€ ™ s a political solution , but thereâ€ ™ s something we can do.â€
�
Then he segued into some talking points about failing public schools and mentioned a single charity group in New York .
I guess
thatâ€
™ s what we can do .
All of it .
Theyâ€ ™ re not some sort of special Jedi Council .
â€ “ Marco Rubio , on the Fed .
Anderson Cooper asks Marco Rubio if he has ever â€œfelt the sting of racism.â€ � â€œSome of the neighborhood kids , older kids , were taunting my family , â€ �
Rubio says of his childhood in Las Vegas during the Mariel boatlift in 1980 .
â€œI never saw it a reflection on America , I saw it as a reflection on those kids and what they were hearing.â€ �
Citing the record - setting racial diversity of the Republican field this year , Rubio says that â€œthat tells you a lot about the Republican party.â€ �
Rubio deservedly gets a lot of grief for being an empty suit â€ “ which , the vast bulk of the time , he is
â€ “
but he seemed human and fairly sharp on the issue of Appleâ€ ™ s encryption of the San Bernardino shooterâ€ ™ s phone .
Itâ€ ™ s a mess , but he made it sound like the thoughtful mess that it is .
He acknowledged the danger of creating backdoors to encryption that criminals could use but , pointedly , the small - government conservative did not acknowledge the ability of the government to abuse it .
That said , he also noted that companies outside the US would not be compelled to follow our backdoor encryption models , which is good point !
But , after all that , he decided , â€œWe are going to have to figure out a way
forwardâ€ � that would also acknowledge â€œexigent circumstancesâ€ � .
This is sort of a big problem for Rubio because it was relatable and thoughtful stuff , but it was not an answer .
It was definitely better than the really sharp , definitive and emphatic non - answers he normally gives , but it still wasnâ€ ™ t an answer .
Then , during the time it took me to type that , he delivered an answer to a woman in the audience on college debt full of ( clearly memorized ) examples and ideas almost verbatim from his last book ; even I could have written those statements at least halfway from memory having read it .
As he talked , he started speaking faster and faster and rhythmically rocking left and right on the balls of his feet .
Left and right , left and right , left and right .
So consider the human moment ended .
We should not lower standards for anyone , because this is not a game ...
Itâ€ ™ s not about the gender , itâ€ ™ s about the ability to do the job .
â€ “ Marco Rubio , on women in combat positions .
So , what â€œconvicted cop killerâ€ � living in Cuba was Rubio talking about when he bashed Obamaâ€ ™ s plan to visit ?
Assata Shakur
( and , if you recognize only the last name , yes , she was rapper
Tupac Shakurâ€ ™ s step - aunt and godmother ) .
Cuba considers her conviction political and has consistently refused to extradite her ; Shakur was a member of the Black Liberation Army who was driving a vehicle with two other members when pulled over by New Jersey State troopers in 1973 .
Shakur and one trooper were shot and survived ; Trooper Werner Foerster and one of her passengers died of gunshot wounds .
Shakur was convicted after a trial in 1977 that her lawyers have argued was prejudiced ( and before and during which her lawyers believe that law enforcement interfered with her defense ) , but she escaped and fled to Cuba in 1979 .
She remains on the FBIâ€ ™ s Most Wanted Terrorist List today .
Read more on Shakur here : â€œI know I havenâ€

�
Citing his service in the US senate on the intelligence committee , Rubio describes his prescience in naming Isis as a major threat to the security of the United States , as well as his vote against the use of force in Syria .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the hardest vote you have to make in Congress , â€ � says Rubio .
â€œNo one running as a Republican has shown better judgment or has more experience on national security than I do.â€

A woman on the verge of entering dental school , who expects to graduate with as much as half a million dollars in debt , asks Marco Rubio about his plan for making education easier and less expensive to access .

the only Republican candidate that consistently talks about student - loan debt , â€ � Rubio says , in part because of his own student - loan debt , which he was only able to pay off after he wrote his book American Son , â€œnow available in paperback.â€
�
Citing accreditation reform , realistic scheduling options for non - traditional students and well - educated debt education for future college students
, Rubio threw himself into this question .
Florida senator Marco Rubio says that Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s plan to visit Cuba - reported tonight - is foolish , and that he would not consider such a trip unless it was under very specific circumstances .
â€œNot if itâ€ ™ s not a free Cuba , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œA year and two months after the opening to Cuba , the Cuban government remains as repressive as ever.â€ �
â€œPresident Obama has no standingâ€ � to address immigration , Rubio says , because two years of control of the White House and both chambers of Congress yielded no action .
â€œPeople wonâ€ ™ t support a comprehensive approach to immigration , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œThe only way forward is a step - by - step approach that begins by securing our border.â€ � â€œNo progress will be made on immigration in this country until we prove to the American people ... that we secure the border.â€ �
Anderson asks Rubio how itâ€ ™ s feeling on the campaign trail , and whether heâ€ ™ s feeling the # MarcoMentum after South Carolina governor Nikki Haleyâ€ ™ s endorsement earlier today .
â€œI feel great about it -
I mean , we feel a lot of energy , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œI feel good about what thatâ€ ™ s gon na translate to , so weâ€ ™ ll see.â€ �
I ran out of new things to say about Ben Carson about three months ago .
All I could think of was to make fun of him ;
thereâ€ ™ s nothing there .
And after telling Anderson Cooper that he enjoys classical music , â€œparticularly baroque , â€ � Ben Carson exits the stage .
Next up : Florida senator Marco Rubio .
I would relish running against either one of them - it would not be a problem .
-Ben
Carson , on which Democratic presidential candidate he would rather run against .
â€œIf
you are the Republican nominee , how do you plan to get your message out over a boisterous Democrat?â€ � asks a town hall attendee , after noting Ben Carsonâ€ ™
s â€œpoliteâ€ � demeanor .
â€œThe key is not so much the volume with which you speak but its the content of what you say
- thatâ€ ™ s
whatâ€ ™ s going to make the difference , â€ � Carson says .
â€œWhen it comes to the general election , people who are running around saying things like â€˜free college for everyone , â€ ™ itâ€ ™ ll be very easy to actually educate people as to the actual financial condition to our nation.â€ � â€œI look forward to such a challenge , â€ � Carson concludes .
Ben Carson , when you decry the â€œfacilities all around the country that are sitting empty because weâ€ ™ ve decided that itâ€ ™ s too expensive to house the mentally ill ...
And then they wind up in prisonâ€ � , thank your friend Ronald Reagan for destroying public mental healthcare in the United States .
On the issue of criminal justice reform , raised by a young woman who lost a close friend to murder , Carson says that the government needs to focus on providing criminals with the tools to successfully reintegrate into society .
â€œWe have 5 % of the population of the world and 25 % of the inmates and that obviously means that something is askew , â€ � Carson says .
â€œWe need to be thinking about whether theyâ€ ™ re going there for life , or whether theyâ€ ™ re going to be reintegrated into society , â€ � and provide those who will rejoin society with practical training to become â€œa welder or a plumber or a whole host of different things.â€ �
Ben Carson believes that people should not drop out of school or go to jail , but that the government should promote the general welfare , not put people on welfare , and in fact back in the old days when people lived far apart sometimes someone would be picking apples and fall and break his leg , and his neighbors would get together and make sure that he remembered Americaâ€ ™ s values , and thatâ€ ™ s why after 15,000 operations Ben Carson is not looking for a job .
Except the presidency .
Which Anderson Cooper had to remind him he was actually looking for .
Letâ€
™ s hope he finds it !
From Guardian US opinion editor Megan Carpentier : Ben Carson , who first noted that America had to compete with the billions of people in China and India , suggested that we had to â€œnot
wasteâ€
� people in the job market .
But instead of suggesting things like paid child care and family leave , which would allow women to remain in the labor force in a cost - effective way ( or even just noting that womenâ€ ™ s labor market participation rate is lower than menâ€ ™ s ) , Carson suggested that we need to lower the high school drop - out rate from its current 20 % ( and reduce incarceration rates ) .
One problem : the Department of Education says that the high school drop - out rate is 7 % .
In his MSNBC interview , Donald Trump refused to assign blame to either side in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to get into it for a different reason , Joe , because if I do win , there has to be a certain amount of surprise , unpredictability , our country has no unpredictability , â€ � he told Joe Scarborough .
The Republican frontrunner added : â€œIf I win , I donâ€
™ t want to be in a position where Iâ€ ™ m saying to you , and the other side now say , â€˜We donâ€ ™ t want Trump involved , we donâ€ ™ t want ...
â€ ™ Let me be sort of a neutral guy
, letâ€ ™ s see what - Iâ€ ™ m going to give it a shot .
It would be so great.â€ �
However , Trump reiterated his longstanding belief that the conflict represented â€œthe toughest agreement of any kind to makeâ€ � and formidable obstacle even for the author of The Art of The Deal .
Donald Trump admitted during his MSNBC interview that there was one reason that he continued to attack rival Jeb Bush , even after the former Florida governor had collapsed in the polls :
â€œI hit Jeb
because heâ€ ™ s sort of easy to hit , to be honest with you.â€

I have multiple marksmanship awards from ROTC .
Ben Carson , apparently forgetting that his record with the ROTC is a bit ... checkered .
A South Carolina voter asks Carson about gun rights : â€œWhat is your plan to preserve my rights to own a gun?â€ �
â€œThe second amendment is there for a very good reason : Itâ€ ™ s so the people could assist the government in case of an invasion , â€ � as well as in case â€œthe government itself ever became tyrannical and attempted to rule the people , â€ � Carson says .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund : Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s insight about the Supreme Court shatters me to my foundations .
Did you know that the founders intended for it to consist of jurists who â€œlove Americaâ€ � , who â€œfully understood its constitutionâ€ � and who understood it â€œshould preserve its constitutional traditionsâ€ � ?
Now I do , and the current court sounds so alien .
Now , in fact , we have activism .
And incorrectness .
If only we were correct .
But how to be correct ?
What we need is a litmus test based on what kind of rulings and associations jurists have had over their lives .
Not a series of questions for potential nominees , which nominees can prep for .
And we definitely have to scrap the current voting system where potential justices grab a scotch egg out of the jar on the bar , and whoever draws the rotten egg becomes the nominee .
On the issue of his lack of political experience , Carson says that his ability to solve problems is more valuable in a presidential candidate than the ability to talk : â€œItâ€ ™ s the political class that has tried to convince everybody that they are the only ones who can solve our problems.â€ �
According to Carson , the United States government was set up to be filled with â€œcitizen statesmenâ€ � , rather than political professionals .
â€œI can guarantee you that I have had more 2 am phone calls than anybody else put together , â€ � Carson said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s we the people that need to assume , once again , the pinnacle position.â€ �
Having people become dependent on others is not compassion at all .
-Ben
Carson , on Christian charity and the welfare state .
Ben Carson says he â€œprobably wouldâ€ � nominate a supreme court justice if he were president , even if it were his last year in office .
As for how he would determine who he would nominate , â€œthe litmus test would be their life , â€ � Carson says , citing previous rulings , life experiences and evaluating what their potential opinions on issues like abortion would be through their previous actions .
Anderson Cooper asks Carson about Appleâ€ ™ s refusal to unlock an iPhone belonging to the deceased perpetrator of the San Bernardino terrorist attack .
â€œApple ...
donâ€ ™ t necessarily trust the government these days , and thereâ€ ™ s probably a very good reason for people not to trust the government , but weâ€ ™ re gon na have to get over that , because today weâ€ ™ re faced with incredible threats , â€ � Carson says .
â€œWhat we need is a public - private partnership when it comes to all of these technical things and cybersecurity , â€ � Carson continues .
Anderson Cooperâ€ ™ s first question : â€œWhatâ€ ™ s harder : brain surgery , or politics?â€ � Carson laughs .
â€œBrain surgeryâ€ ™ s a lot harder!â€ �
Donald Trump also condemned Apple for not cooperating with federal investigators to crack an iPhone belonging to one of the two perpetrators of the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino , California which left 14 Americans dead .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s disgraceful that Apple is not helping on that ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI think security first and I feel -
I always felt security first .
Apple should absolutely - we should force them to do it .
We should do whatever we have to do ,
â€ � the Republican frontrunner said .
In his town hall with MSNBCâ€ ™ s Joe Scarborough , Donald Trump backtracked on whether he might sue Ted Cruz over a campaign ad that uses footage of the Republican frontrunner saying that he is pro - choice . â€œI donâ€ ™ t know that weâ€ ™ re going to have a lawsuit , but we certainly want to keep somebody honest , â€ �
Trump said .
Still , Trump felt confident that he might succeed , saying , â€œIâ€ ™ ve had great success in business , Iâ€ ™ ve had great success with lawsuits , Iâ€ ™ ve had great success in things I do.â€
�
In an interview with MSNBCâ€ ™ s Joe Scarborough , Donald Trump dismissed the Wall Street Journal / NBC poll which came out earlier today which showed Cruz with a narrow 28 % to 26 % lead nationally .
It was the first time Trump had trailed in a national poll since the beginning of November .
â€œI think someone at the Wall Street Journal doesnâ€ ™ t like me .
But I never do well with the Wall Street Journal polls .
I donâ€
™ t know , they do these small samples and I donâ€
™ t know exactly what it representsâ€
� said Trump .
Meanwhile , back at the ranch ... billionaire Donald Trump - who is not scheduled to appear in tonightâ€ ™ s town hall event on CNN - will instead appear on rival cable network MSNBC in a pre - taped interview with Morning Joeâ€ ™ s Joe Scarborough .
That interview , which will run the gamut from his immigration stance to his suggested lawsuit against fellow candidate Ted Cruz , will be covered by the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ben Jacobs - right here in this liveblog .
The winnowing field of Republican presidential candidates is about to begin the last nationally televised event before South Carolina voters take to the polls on Saturday for the first - in - the - South primary .
The first in a pair of town hall events will feature Texas senator Ted Cruz , Florida senator Marco Rubio and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson -
tomorrow nightâ€ ™ s town hall will feature former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Ohio governor John Kasich and billionaire Donald Trump .
CNNâ€ ™ s Anderson Cooper is moderating both events .
Mormon and Latino communities could offer Marco Rubio , who spent six years of his childhood in Nevada , a path to caucus success , report Sabrina Siddiqui and Daniel Hernandez : Rubioâ€ ™ s family moved to Nevada when he was eight years old .
His mother worked as a hotel maid at Imperial Palace on the strip .
And though they only spent six years in Las Vegas , the Florida senator has often referred to his familyâ€ ™ s stint there as a formative period in his life that has , in many ways , shaped his view of working - class America .
No other presidential candidate , Democratic or Republican , can claim to have such a connection with the state .
On paper , Rubio would be well suited for a strong finish in its 23 February caucus , although his standing in the Republican race has grown more precarious after a disappointing showing in New Hampshire .
Rubio has made just five swings through Nevada as a presidential candidate , having divided much of his time between the first three early voting states â€ “ Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina .
But the senatorâ€ ™ s few trips there have carried less an aura of a routine campaign stop than the feeling of a homecoming .
Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz called out rival Donald Trump during a news conference in Seneca , South Carolina , earlier today , telling him : â€œIf you want to file a lawsuit ... file the lawsuit.â€ �
The argument in question : a television ad the Cruz campaign ran suggesting that Trump is pro - choice , which Trump claimed is misleading and defamatory .
There are a couple things to say about the latest Wall Street Journal / NBC poll that shows Trump falling Cruz .
The first is that the poll was based on 800 registered voters of which 400 were GOP primary voters .
If you agree with Trump that those numbers are low you had better reconsider your relationship with polling in general - such small sample sizes arenâ€ ™ t unusual at all ( which is one of many reasons why polls arenâ€ ™ t all that accurate these days ) .
And Trump certainly hasnâ€ ™ t had a problem proudly sharing similar polls in the past that have showed him in the leading position .
The second point worth making is that this is just one poll - we have no idea whether itâ€ ™ s an outlier or part of a new emerging trend until we see what other survey results say over the next few weeks .
Real Clear Politics has an averageof all polls and it shows Trump safely leading Cruz by 18 percentage points .
So Trumpâ€ ™ s skepticism is right - itâ€ ™ s just being voiced at a suspiciously convenient time .
Donald Trump may have delivered the shortest speech of his campaign in an outdoor rally in rural South Carolina , the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ben Jacobs reports from Walterboro : Donald Trump may have delivered the shortest speech of his campaign in an outdoor rally in rural South Carolina on Wednesday .
In front of a crowd of roughly one thousand , the Republican frontrunner delivered his stump speech in a crisp 24 minutes , a record pace for the normally verbose Trump .
Appearing in front of a banner emblazoned with Low Country Sportsmen for Trump , the real estate mogul accepted the groupâ€ ™ s endorsement in front of a crowd that started to shiver as the sun set .
Despite the fireworks earlier in the day , with Cruz holding a long press conference where welcomed a threatened lawsuit from Trump , the real estate mogul only took a cursory shot at the Texas senator .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s a guy he fibs , he lies , he does stuff to Ben Carson ,
â€ �
Trump said of Cruz .
Some in the crowd didnâ€ ™ t seem to mind the short speech .
As guests of the Low Country Sportsmen , they got to dig into several whole hogs that had been barbecued while drinking beverages out of red Solo cups .
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign released a scathing new ad on Wednesday that accuses rival Marco Rubio of pushing â€œamnesty for illegals , â€ � reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Sabrina Siddiqui from Aiken , South Carolina : The one - minute TV spot , which will hit the airwaves in South Carolina days before the stateâ€ ™ s primary
, draws a direct link between the immigration platform of Rubio and Barack Obama .
Zeroing in on the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s sponsorship of a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 , which Rubio has since disavowed , the ad features a mash - up of Obama and Rubio making the case to grant citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants in almost verbatim terms .
â€œMarco Rubio burned us once .
He shouldnâ€ ™ t get the chance to sell us out again , â€ � the narrator says .
Earlier in the day , Rubio told reporters Cruz was â€œlyingâ€ � about his record and spreading misinformation to bolster his campaign .
Rubio and Cruz are locked in a bitter and increasingly ugly contest to emerge as the prohibitive alternative to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
Recent polls have shown Rubio gaining ground in South Carolina , nipping just at the heels of Cruzâ€ ™ s second - place position .
Reached for comment by the Guardian , Rubio spokesman Joe Pounder slammed Cruz in a statement : â€œNo amount of cheap video editing can cover - up for Senator Cruzâ€ ™ s lies about his own record of wanting immigration reform to pass , advocating for a path to legal status , and wanting to â€˜compromiseâ€ ™ on illegal immigrants .
Senator Cruzâ€ ™ s millions in attack ads
canâ€ ™ t undo his lifelong record of putting politics ahead of conservative principles.â€

And the money polls kept rolling in !
At the moment a new poll dropped showing billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump behind Ted Cruz for the first time among national Republicans , Bloomberg Politics released a poll showing the candidate holding a staggering 19-point lead over Ted Cruz among likely South Carolina Republican primary voters , with Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush duking it out in a close race for third place .
Trump dominates Cruz and the other candidates among nearly every demographic group , including besting Cruz among evangelical Christians .
Trump is most trusted by the respondents to tackle nearly every issue .
Among the areas in which Trump scores highest : as the candidate who would be most feared by Americaâ€ ™ s enemies ( 57 % ) ; take on the â€œestablishmentâ€ � ( 51 % ) ; win the general election ( 43 % ) ; tackle illegal immigration ( 41 % ) ; and , somewhat surprisingly given Cruzâ€ ™ s background as a former Supreme Court clerk , appoint the best Supreme Court justices ( 24 % ) .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s improbable seven - month ride atop national polls of likely Republican voters may finally be slipping : In a national poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal , the billionaire businessman has lost his national lead , slipping behind senator Ted Cruz of Texas in a poll released justthisminute .
Cruz leads with 28 % support nationwide among Republican voters , beating Trumpâ€ ™ s 26 % by two percentage points .
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida follows in third place with 17 % , trailed by followed by Ohio governor John Kasichâ€ ™ s 11 % , retired neurosurgeon
Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s 10 % and former Florida governor Jeb ( ! )
Bushâ€ ™ s 4 % .
In the last iteration of the poll , Trump topped Cruz by 13 % , 33 % to 20 % .
But this latest poll , conducted between Sunday and Tuesday , comes after Cruz beat Trump in the Iowa caucuses , and after Trumpâ€ ™ s universally panned performance in last weekendâ€ ™ s debate in South Carolina , in which he attacked former president George W. Bush over the September 11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq .
The four latest polls of Palmetto State Republicans - all conducted after the debate - show Trump with an average lead of 17.5 percentage points over Cruz .
In two other national surveys released today , Trump leads the GOP field by 15 and 20 percentage points , making the NBC / Wall Street Journal numbers a major outlier .
At a rally at the Parkway Ballroom in Chicago , Hillary Clinton promised to push for stricter gun laws and better law enforcement practices , saying the country owes it to the â€œmothers of the movementâ€ � , who have lost children to gun violence and police killings .
Clinton began by invoking the names of Sandra Bland , a black woman who was found dead in her jail cell following a traffic stop in Texas last summer , and Laquan McDonald , a young black man who was shot by a Chicago police officer in 2014 .
While Clinton spoke , Blandâ€ ™ s family nodded in agreement behind her .
â€œThese stories can not be ones that just provoke our emotions , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œThey must move us to action .
They must motivate every one of us to take on these issues reforming police practices and making it as hard as possible for people to get guns who shouldnâ€ ™ t have them in the first place.â€ �
At the start of the rally , Blandâ€ ™ s mother , Geneva Reed - Veal , joined by her daughters and husband , recited a poem she wrote about Clinton , a woman she described as having the â€œstaying powerâ€ � even after 20 years in politics .
â€œNow is the time and this is place /
Now we are ready and Hillary is the face , â€ �
Reed - Veal began .
When she spoke about her daughter , Reed Veal began to tear up .
Clinton reached out , and Reed - Veal finished her introduction .
Clinton has won the support of a coalition of mothers whose children were victims of gun violence , including Gwen Carr , mother of Eric Garner ; Maria Hamilton , mother of Dontre Hamilton ; and Lucy McBath , mother of Jordan Davis ; are planning to campaign for Clinton .
During Clintonâ€ ™ s remarks , which echoed a speech she gave in Harlem on Tuesday , she also took the opportunity to criticize Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , especially over his relationship with the president who remains wildly popular among Democrats .
â€œMy opponent has been quite critical of the president .
He has called him weak , he has called him disappointing
he even tried to advocate for somebody to run against him when he ran in 2012,â€ �
Clinton said , while some in the crowd booed and jeered .
â€œI am unapologetic , â€ � she continued , above the applause .
â€œI will build on the progress that President Obama has made.â€ �
She also implied that Sanders was a dreamer with a host of big ideas that were unachievable in the current political climate .
â€œI wonâ€ ™ t make any promises that I canâ€
™ t keep , â€ � she said .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need any more of those.â€ � Clinton returned to her native Chicago on Wednesday both to campaign and fundraise .
After the rally , she was expected to attend two private fundraisers in the afternoon and a fundraising event in the evening .
Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said Wednesday he hoped Apple would â€œvoluntarilyâ€ � unlock the San Bernardino shooterâ€ ™ s phone ,
the Guardianâ€ ™ s Sabrina Siddiqui reports from South Carolina : â€œUltimately , I think being a good corporate citizen is important ,
â€ �
Rubio told reporters while campaigning in Mount Pleasant , South Carolina , while adding there was â€œno easy answerâ€ � on the issue of encryption .
â€œOn
the one hand this encryption is designed to prevent people from having unauthorized access to your private information .
On the other hand there are terrorists and criminals who are using encryption to protect themselves.â€ �
The Florida senator said the government would have to work collaboratively with the private sector to reach a solution .
â€œThe question is how can we work collaboratively with Silicon Valley and the tech industry to work through this issue we now face , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œAmerica has a history in times of war , in times of challenge , of working with the private sector .
As president , he added , Rubio would seek out a way forward on encryption â€œthat protects Americaâ€ ™ s privacy but still allows [ the federal government ] access to valuable information that can prevent future attacks.â€ �
Is the Monmouth University poll showing Ohio governor John Kasich in the single digits in South Carolina spooking him out of the contest ?
Sure looks that way .
According to the Boston Globe , Kasich will not be in the Palmetto State for its Republican primary this Saturday - instead , heâ€ ™ ll be hosting a town hall meeting in Worcester , Massachusetts and will later attend a $ 2,700-per - person fundraiser in Bostonâ€ ™ s bougie Back Bay neighborhood .
The event pairing is likely an event to pave Kasichâ€ ™ s way for the Massachusetts Republican primary , to be held on March 1 .
Kasich , who has been battling for fourth place in South Carolina , has previously stated that heâ€ ™ s not expecting to win the nationâ€ ™ s second primary .
The Massachusetts primary , on the other hand , may be fertile ground for the more moderate Kasich .
Itâ€ ™ s no secret that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders represents an overwhelmingly vanilla - white state , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino - a problem thatâ€ ™ s only going to snowball as the primaries move to the South : His critics say thatâ€ ™ s left him flat - footed in responding to issues of racial inequality .
Remember Netroots Nation , when Sandersâ€ ™ s response to Black Lives Matter protesters inspired the ironic hashtag # BernieSoBlack ?
As the primary race moves to more diverse states , Sanders is making a more concerted efforts to reach black voters .
But Vermontâ€ ™ s black leaders told the Daily Beast that their senator Sanders did little to connect with them .
One leader said Sanders only wanted to discuss income inequality and dismissed attempts to address other issues .
â€œHe just always kept coming back to income inequality as a response , as if talking about income inequality would somehow make issues of racism go away , â€ � said Curtiss Reed Jr. , the executive director of Vermont Partnership for Fairness and Diversity .
This criticism may prove problematic for Sanders as he courts voters who are dually and disproportionately affected by racial and economic inequality .
So far in his campaign , Sanders has addressed racism through the lens of economic inequality .
Rather , she would tackle it as its own ugly form of inequality that is connected to and exacerbated by economic inequality .
On Tuesday , Hillary Clinton drew a clear distinction between herself and Sanders on issues concerning race and implied that her opponent wasnâ€ ™ t up to the challenge .
â€œWe have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism , â€ � she said , speaking in Harlem on Tuesday .
â€œBecause
these are not only problems of economic inequality .
These are problems of racial inequality .
And we have got to say that loudly and clearly.â€
�
On Wednesday , surrogates for Clinton piled on .
â€œIt is disturbing to read that Bernie Sanders has a record of consistently turning his back against the Black voters in his very own state of Vermont , â€ � said South Carolina representative Todd Rutherford .
â€œThe lack of confidence that African - American citizens in Vermont have about Senator Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ leadership is troubling and should be of concern to Black voters throughout the country , â€ � said former NYC mayor , David Dinkins .
Sandersâ€ ™ campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment .
Whose endorsement would you rather have ?
Governor Nikki Haley will endorse Marco Rubio for president , it was reported on Wednesday , lending a major boost to the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s campaign just days ahead of the South Carolina Republican primary , writes Guardian political reporter Sabrina Siddiqui in Aiken , South Carolina :
The Post and Courier first reported the endorsement , adding that Haley will appear alongside Rubio at an evening campaign event in Chapin .
Haley will become the third influential South Carolina official to back Rubio .
The senator already has the support of Senator Tim Scott and Congressman Trey Gowdy , two of the stateâ€ ™ s popular lawmakers .
Haleyâ€ ™ s endorsement had long been sought by Republican candidates .
Although her endorsement of Mitt Romney in 2012 did not help him to secure a victory in South Carolina , Haley has risen significantly in stature since then .
Haley , the second Indian American to be elected governor and first woman to hold the post in South Carolina , resurfaced on the national scene last year after a racially motivated church shooting in Charleston .
She was widely praised for her response , which included swift action to remove the Confederate flag from the grounds of the state Capitol .
She also delivered the Republican response to this yearâ€ ™ s State of the Union address , earning accolades for speaking out against the sharp anti - immigrant rhetoric that has taken hold of the GOP primary .
Rubio has lavished Haley with praise , particularly for how she handled the Emanuel AME church massacre , and told reporters Tuesday he would welcome her endorsement .
A spokesman for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has dismissed charges of sexism against Sanders supporter Killer Mike , the Atlanta - based rapper , as â€œgotchaâ€ � politics .
Speaking at a Sanders rally at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Tuesday , Killer Mike argued against the Hillary Clinton candidacy in part by quoting the activist Jane Elliott as saying , â€œMichael , a uterus doesnâ€ ™ t qualify you to be president of the United States.â€ �
After a local reporter live - tweeted the line without the Elliott reference , the rapper was attacked on social media as sexist .
That charge was amplified by the Clinton campaign , with senior communications adviser Karen Finney piling on on Twitter : Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said Wednesday that Killer Mike , who has been campaigning widely for the senator , â€œdoesnâ€ ™ t believe gender should be a reason to vote for or against someone.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s the point Mike was making when he quoted Jane Elliott , the internationally known educator , â€ � said Briggs .
â€œWe need to get beyond the gotcha politics and get to the issues at the heart of the election.â€ � â€œI donâ€ ™ t and never will Hate or think less of women , â€ � the rapper said in a tweet referring to former Ohio state senator Nina Turner , who also spoke at the rally .
â€œSen .
Nina Turner is my Next Great Political Champ but Iâ€ ™ m sorry
No HRC for me.â€ � Killer Mike , aka Michael Render , and his supporters circulated transcripts of his speech to illustrate the context of his â€œuterusâ€ � remark :
Thereâ€ ™ s video , too : And hereâ€ ™ s the full speech .
Elliott herself defended the rapper in an interview with the Huffington Post , saying , â€œitâ€ ™ s a ridiculous thing to be upset
aboutâ€ � :
But others who took up the discussion , including former Guardian US columnist Jill Filipovic and others , said the context did not excuse the statement .
Filipovic compared the controversy to recent consternation in Democratic circles at comments feminist icon Gloria Steinem and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright made about young women who support Sanders .
Albright warned there was a â€œspecial place in hellâ€ � for women who donâ€ ™ t support other women , and Steinem suggested that young women supporting Sanders were in it for the boys .
Both later apologized .
The local paper has the scoop : popular South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has thrown her support behind Florida senator Marco Rubio , as the stateâ€ ™ s Republicans prepare to vote Saturday .
Haley tangled with Donald Trump after her response to Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s state of the union address this year , in which she called on Republicans to reject the â€œsiren call of the angriest voices.â€ �
For some reason Trump thought she was talking about him .
The Donald Trump campaign has responded to Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s challenge to Trump to make good on a defamation lawuit threat over a Cruz ad .
â€œDonald I would encourage you , if you want to file a lawsuit challenging this ad , claiming it is defamation , file a lawsuit , â€ �
Cruz said at a midday news conference .
â€œIf I want to bring a lawsuit it would be legitimate ,
â€ �
Trump replies , in a statement obtained by the Guardian : Ted Cruz has already had one of his ads pulled off the air concerning Senator Rubio because it was totally false .
Additionally , he was forced to apologize to Dr. Ben Carson for fraudulently stealing his votes in Iowa , and was embarrassed by his phony voter violation form .
He is a liar and these ads and statements made by Cruz are clearly desperate moves by a guy who is tanking in the polls- watching his campaign go up in flames finally explains Cruzâ€ ™ s logo .
I am
pro - life and I do not support tax payer funding for Planned Parenthood as long as they are performing abortions .
I have been clear about my position on this issue for years .
I am also a strong advocate of the second amendment and a proud member of the NRA , as are my sons .
I will repeal and replace ObamaCare and I would nominate a very conservative Justice to protect our freedoms and conservative values .
If I want to bring a lawsuit it would be legitimate .
Likewise , if I want to bring the lawsuit regarding Senator Cruz being a natural born Canadian I will do so .
Time will tell , Teddy .

Our conception of how the general presidential race will look and feel is necessarily uninformed and subject to change .
Many voters havenâ€ ™ t yet gotten to know the candidates .
Minds can change depending on events or star signs or weather or who knows what .
There are months to go in which any candidate may rise or plummet .
Nonetheless , pollsters are posing questions about theoretical general election matchups to voters .
USA Today / Suffolk have dropped a new poll showing Bernie Sanders out - performing Hillary Clinton : The nationwide survey , taken Thursday through Monday , underscores how formidable an opponent the 74-year - old democratic socialist has become against one of theDemocratic Partyâ€ ™ s most established figures .
Ben Carson , the retired neurosurgeon , has scored an endorsement from an elected official !
His first , according to FiveThirtyEightâ€ ™ s endorsement tracker .
Carson gets the nod from Maryland Representative Andy Harris , a fellow doctor at Johns Hopkins known for his solitary and staunch opposition to marijuana decriminalization in Washington , DC .
Update :
Utah senator Mike Lee , possibly Cruzâ€ ™ s only friend in the Senate , plans to campaign in South Carolina tomorrow alongside Marco Rubio .
But Lee will campaign with Cruz , too , his spokesperson says .
CORRECTION :
This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Lee plans to campaign in South Carolina with both Cruz and Rubio , not Rubio alone , as initially reported , which would have been a serious burn on Cruz .
Cruz is kneecapping Rubio , too .
â€œEthics matter , â€ � says Cruz , who spread a false rumor in Iowa that Ben Carson had dropped out of the campaign and sent mailers to voters accusing them of a â€œvoting violation.â€ � â€œIt drives the narrative they want to sell , â€ �
Cruz says of Rubio campaign Cruz :
â€œMarco Rubio is behaving like Donald Trump with a smile.â€ � â€œThe one candidate who has done a push poll is Marco Rubio , â€ �
Cruz says , adding : â€œEthics matter.â€ � â€œI think Justice Scaliaâ€ ™ s passing this week elevated the stakes of this election , â€ � Cruz says .
He says South Carolina voters are asking themselves , â€˜Who
can I trust?â€ ™ Cruz says that Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œfour decadesâ€ � of writing checks for â€œleft - wing Democratsâ€ � proves that he doesnâ€ ™ t care about conservative justices .
â€œWe are one justice away from the second amendment being erased from the Bill of Rights.â€ �
In case anyone missed that , Cruz puts a finer point on it :
A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to erase the second amendment from the Bill of Rights.â€ � Cruz at peak Cruz : Even in the annals of frivolous lawsuits , this takes the cake .
And so Donald I would encourage you , if you want to file a lawsuit challenging this ad , claiming it is defamation , file a lawsuit .
â€œIt is a remarkable contention that an ad that plays video of Donald Trump speaking on national television is somehow defamation.â€ �
Cruz is going after Trump in this news conference , listing â€œpro - abortion Democratsâ€ � that Trump has contributed to :
At a news conference in Seneca , New Hampshire , Texas senator Ted Cruz is reading a cease - and - desist letter his campaign received from Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s lawyer .
Cruz says the letter singles out an ad Cruz is running tarring Trump as pro - choice and unfit to pick the next Supreme Court justice .
â€œWe can not trust Donald Trump with these serious decisions , â€ � the ad says .
On Monday , Trump threatened to sue Cruz over the senatorâ€ ™ s eligibility for president , saying that unless his rival stops telling â€œliesâ€ � he will take the issue of his birth in Canada to court .
Hereâ€ ™ s the Cruz ad : Will the South Carolina governor pick a horse in the South Carolina race ?
Speaking of polls â€ “
hey look
thereâ€
™ s another one , conducted in South Carolina by Monmouth Universityâ€ ™ s
polling institute , which agrees with the picture everyone else has taken in the state of a big lead for Trump , just three days out .
Among voters likely to participate in South Carolinaâ€ ™ s Republican primary on Saturday , the pollster reports , itâ€ ™ s :
Trump 35 â€ “
Cruz 19 â€ “ Rubio 17 â€
“ Kasich 9 â€
“ Bush 8 â€ “ Carson 7
That 16-point lead for Trump is close to his 17.5-point lead in the state in Real Clear Politicsâ€ ™ polling averages .
Monmouth sees broad support for Trump across pretty much all demographic groups : Trump is the clear favorite of voters who have not been to college ( 53 % ) , but also garners the support of about 3-in-10 voters with a college education .
He leads among both men ( 36 % ) and women ( 34 % ) ; among voters under 50 years old ( 34 % ) and those age 50 or older ( 35 % ) ; among voters in veteransâ€ ™ households ( 38 % ) as well as non - veterans ( 32 % ) ; and among evangelical Christians ( 33 % ) and non - evangelicals ( 37 % ) alike .
Cruz ( 31 % ) barely nips Trump ( 27 % ) among very conservative voters , but Trump enjoys the most support of any candidate among somewhat conservative ( 40 % ) and moderate ( 41 % ) voters .
Is Bernie Sanders a national candidate ?
The question is met with indignation by Sanders supporters , who point to repeated instances so far this election cycle of Sanders upending the conventional wisdom that heâ€ ™ s a niche candidate : by building a huge national network of donors , by drawing crowds of thousands from New Hampshire to Nevada to Michigan , by nearly beating Hillary Clinton in Iowa after trailing there in polls by double digits , by tying Clinton in two polls of Nevada voters , and by his whopping 22-point win in New Hampshire , which Clinton won in 2008 .
And yet : a new Public Policy Polling survey poses the question of Sandersâ€ ™ national viability with new urgency .
The poll finds Hillary Clinton leading the way in 10 of 12 states that will vote between 1 March and 8 March .
Clinton holds double - digit leads in nine of those states , according to the poll .
Sanders leads only in Massachusetts and in Vermont , his home state .
He appears close to Clinton in Oklahoma , which is among 14 states to vote on 1 March .
Sanders has long suffered a perceived gap with Clinton among non - white voters and voters without a college degree â€ “ groups that figure heavily in the demographics of states that will vote in early March .
Clinton has vociferously challenged Sandersâ€ ™ attempt in particular to close the gap with African American voters .
â€œYou canâ€ ™ t just show up at election time and say the right things and think thatâ€ ™ s enough
, â€ � Clinton said in a speech to civil rights leaders in Harlem on Tuesday .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.â€ �
The argument appears to be holding with South Carolina voters , who polling averages say favor Clinton by more than 20 points .
Pollsters arenâ€ ™ t always right ( ! ) and the numbers can change quickly .
But the emerging national picture does not appear , as the latest numbers come in , to hold obvious good news for the insurgent candidate .
To which his supporters might say , see you at the voting booth .
Candidates , theyâ€ ™ re just like us !
At least Texas senator Ted Cruz is , apparently .
Because Cruz needs a tanker truck of coffee in the morning to succeed at basic functions such as blinking and speech , the Washington Postâ€ ™ s
Katie Zezima entertainingly reports : There are the emails with the 1 a.m. time stamp , dinners that start when some people go to bed and meetings that stretch late into the night .
Donâ€ ™ t expect to see him bright and early on the campaign trail â€ ” in a field of GOP presidential candidates where 8 a.m. events happen with some regularity , Cruz starts late in the morning , often clutching a cup of coffee .
Cruz is a â€œnight owl , â€ � his wife Heidi says , telling voters her husband shares nocturnal tendencies with his mother .
â€œWhen he comes home from the campaign trail , theyâ€ ™ re often in the living room talking late , late into the nightâ€ � over tea , she said last month .
Enjoy the full piece here .

A long Bernie Sanders video spot featuring Erica Garner , the daughter of Eric Garner , the Staten Island man who died after being placed in a chokehold by police , is circulating widely in advance of the Democratic South Carolina primary in 10 days .
A majority of South Carolina Democratic primary - goers are African American .
Erica Garner has been appearing with Sanders on the campaign trail in the state .
â€œIâ€ ™ m behind anyone whoâ€ ™ s going to listen and speak up for us .
And I think we need to believe in a leader like Bernie Sanders , â€ � Erica Garner says in the video .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not scared to go up against the criminal justice system .
Heâ€ ™ s not
scared.â€ �
Garner tells her fatherâ€ ™ s story and about how the family has dealt with his death : I was able to see my dad die on national TV .
They donâ€
™ t know what they took from us .
He wasnâ€ ™ t just someone that no one cared for him , or no one loved him .
He was loved dearly ...
Iâ€ ™ m just trying to get the truth out there to tell his side of the story .
He was being the loving , caring man that he was , and he was murdered .
The spot gets an approving nod from Republican strategist Rick Wilson : Donald Trump was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night .
Well , Trump called into the show , at least .
Colbert is from Charleston , South Carolina , where Republicans plan to vote â€ “ apparently a lot of them for Trump â€ “ on Saturday .
Trump calls in .
Colbert asks him what heâ€ ™ s wearing .
Trump says heâ€ ™ s wearing â€œa very beautiful blue suit with a very poor tie but the tie will get better as the day goes on.â€ � Weird .
Then Trump says he hopes South Carolina will vote for him .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to make America great again.â€ �
Colbert challenges Trump on his â€œpotty mouth.â€
�
Trump : â€œIâ€ ™ ve decided to stopâ€ � talking dirty .
â€œThese are very minor words , and in many cases I actually bleep them out myself , â€ �
he says .
Go bleep yourself ?
Colbert says he should keep a swear jar and every time he cusses he should put a billion dollars in there .
Then Trump says the senate â€œhas a right ... not to vote on [ a new Supreme Court nominee ] .
Look , if I was the president Iâ€ ™
d be pushing.â€ �
Trump tries a southern accent :
â€œPlease vote for me , yâ€ ™ all.â€ � Exeunt .
After being battered on national security in Iowa by Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz is taking no chances in the ultra hawkish state of South Carolina , writes Guardian political correspondent Ben Jacobs :
Proclaiming that he wants a military with â€œmore tooth and less tailâ€ � , Cruz went on a statewide tour on Tuesday to tout his national security credentials .
Starting with a speech on board the USS Yorktown , a decommissioned aircraft carrier from the second world war , the senator from Texas laid out an approach that relied on beefing up the US armed forces with occasional doses of red meat for social conservative voters .
In a campaign stop in Columbia , Cruz pledged to increase the US armyâ€ ™ s enlistment by 75,000 troops as well as add more ships to the navy and more planes to the air force .
However , he made clear that these additional soldiers would be mostly men , casting scorn upon those Republican rivals who want to â€œdraft our daughters into combatâ€ � .

Update : South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham , who is stumping this week in the state for Jeb Bush , has an opinion to share about a potential Trump nomination as the 2016 Republican presidential candidate : Graham means that with Trump at the top of the ticket , Republicans could lose their eight - seat senate majority and down - ballot races galore .

™ Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Three days from now , Democrats caucus in Nevada and Republicans hold a primary in South Carolina .
Hereâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s happening : Nevada neck - and - neck ?
In a CNN / ORC poll of likely caucus attendees published Wednesday , 48 % said they supported Hillary Clinton and 47 % backed Sanders .
Be advised that the Nevada caucuses have proven tricky for pollsters in the past .
This is the second recent poll to show a Nevada tie , FWIW .
The same poll showed Trump way ahead in Nevada among likely caucus - goers , with 45 % to Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s 19 % , and Clinton with a large lead in South Carolina , where Democrats vote on Saturday 27 February .
The president got some things off his mind in a news conference yesterday , including the need for the Senate to consider his next supreme court pick ...
The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen .
When there is a vacancy on the supreme court , the president of the United States is to nominate someone .
The Senate is to consider that nomination , and either they disapprove of that nominee , or that nominee is elevated to the supreme court ...
There is more than enough time for the Senate to consider in a thoughtful way the record of a nominee that I present and to make a decision . ...
and his perception that Donald J Trump will not be the 45th US president : I continue to believe Mr Trump will not be president , and the reason is that I have a lot of faith in the American people , and
and I think they recognize that being president is a serious job .
Point , counterpoint : Then again , normal usually happens .
Our team in the field today includes Ben Jacobs with Donald Trump and Sabrina Siddiqui with Marco Rubio .
Later Sabrina will attend a town hall featuring three Republican candidates : Carson , Rubio and Ted Cruz .
As counter - programming to the town hall , Trump is holding an event of his own , some kind of love - in tonight with MSNBC host Joe Scarborough .
Hey , look , itâ€ ™ s American politics in a nutshell .
Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s America ... ... versus Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ America :
Honorable mention :"
2016-02-17,"Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio â€ “ and all the other Republican obstructionists who want to block Obama from nominating a new US supreme court justice â€ “ would be wise to learn their 19th century history before theyâ€ ™ re doomed to repeat it .
Immediately after the death over the weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia , Republican members of Congress , led by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell , announced that they would block any nomination to the court by Obama , a call echoed by Republican presidential candidates .
But such efforts to avoid confirming a judge with opposing views may well backfire â€ “ itâ€ ™ s impossible to call in advance whether forcing a delay will work in the service of oneâ€ ™ s ideological agenda , or against it .
It happened both ways in the 19th century , when two supreme court justices died in election years â€ ” associate justice Henry Baldwin , who died in April 1844 , and chief justice Roger B Taney , who passed away just a month before election day in 1864 .
It might seem unfair to draw parallels between Scalia and Taney , who was almost certainly the worst chief justice in US history ; however , despite liberal colleague Ruth Bader Ginsburgâ€ ™ s obvious deep affection for Scalia , thereâ€ ™ s no denying that he was responsible for the high courtâ€ ™ s conservative shift in recent years , from the Citizens United case , which unleashed the floodgates of corporate money into politics , to the overturning of the Voting Rights Act , to his constant opposition to reproductive rights and marriage equality .
Taney , who served on the court from 1836 to his death , was a staunch conservative and a proponent of slavery .
Most famously , he handed down the infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857 that ruled that African Americans could not be citizens .
In Taneyâ€ ™ s words , blacks were â€œaltogether unfit to associate with the white race , either in social or political relations , and so far unfit that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respectâ€ � .
Yes , Citizens United pales in comparison to this , but keep in mind that Scalia was the person who once compared homosexuality to â€œreprehensibleâ€ � conduct , such as â€œmurder , for example , or polygamy , or cruelty to animalsâ€
� .
In his dissent in Lawrence v Texas , which struck down Texasâ€ ™ s sodomy laws , he opined that homosexuality was akin to â€œprostitution , adult incest , adultery , obscenity , and child
pornographyâ€ � .
Taney , originally from the border state of Maryland , remained on the bench during the civil war and was a thorn in Abraham Lincolnâ€ ™ s side , ruling against the president during the war , most famously when Lincoln suspended habeas corpus .
Taneyâ€ ™ s death in October 1864 delighted many ; most of Lincolnâ€ ™ s cabinet refused to attend the funeral , including secretary of the navy Gideon Welles , who wrote in his diary : â€œThe course pursued [ by Taney ] in the Dred Scott case and all the attending circumstances forfeited respect for him as a man or a judge.â€ �
Despite the fact that the Senate was firmly controlled by liberal Republicans ( a party which shares little but a name with its current incarnation ) , Lincoln held off naming a successor to Taney until after his reelection , not wanting to provide any ammunition over his choice to his rival , Democrat George B McClellan .
Lincoln won reelection handily .
A month later , Salmon Chase , the former Treasury secretary , was nominated and confirmed to the bench in a single day .
His support for Lincolnâ€ ™ s agenda helped the passage of the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments â€ “ all of which would have been adamantly opposed by racist Roger Taney .
Similarly , it seems that whomever Obama nominates to the high court will have a similar Chase - like effect , pointing the court in a more liberal direction and undoing some of Scaliaâ€ ™
s work â€
“ if the president can get the Senate to vet his eventual nominee .
Thereâ€ ™ s a chance , however , that Obama will face the same treatment as John Tyler , the 10th president and the first vice - president to take office upon the death of a president .
William Henry Harrison , elected on the Whig ticket in 1840 , caught pneumonia at his inauguration and died 30 days later , becoming the countryâ€ ™ s first president to die in office ( and the one with the shortest tenure ) .
The constitution did not then have a formal right of succession , but that didnâ€ ™ t stop Tyler from assuming the presidency .
His rivals â€ “ basically everyone in Washington â€
“ took to calling him
â€œHis
Accidency.â€ �
Tylerâ€ ™ s one term in office is rarely remembered today , but he had the bad luck to have two supreme court justices die in office during his term : Smith Thompson and Henry Baldwin .
When Thompson died in December 1843 , Tyler nominated his treasury secretary , John C Spencer , to the bench , but the Whig - controlled Senate saw Spencer as a traitor to the party and thwarted his appointment .
Tylerâ€ ™ s next nominee , Edward King , faced a similar fate .
By that point , Tylerâ€ ™ s rival , Whig Senator Henry Clay , was running for president and certainly wanted to wait until he was in office to make his own nomination and shape the court .
Then , in April 1844 , associate justice Henry Baldwin also passed away , leaving two vacancies on the bench .
Clayâ€ ™ s Senate doubled down , refusing to support any Tyler nominee .
When Clay lost the 1844 presidential election , a replacement for Thompson â€ “ Democrat Samuel Nelson â€ “ was finally confirmed in February 1845 , Tylerâ€ ™ s last month in office .
But it took the Senate a record 27 months after Baldwinâ€ ™ s death before President James K Polkâ€ ™ s eventual nominee , Democrat Robert Cooper Grier , was confirmed in 1846 .
Henry Clayâ€ ™ s plan had backfired : he had hoped to hand pick two Whigs for the bench ; instead the supreme court was now firmly in the hands of Roger Taneyâ€ ™ s Democrats , whose rulings would fundamentally alter Americaâ€ ™ s history and ultimately lead to the civil war .
Todayâ€ ™ s Senate Republicans should be careful what they wish for : come January 2017 , the White House and Congress may look very different â€ “ and not in the way they imagine ."
2016-02-19,"The death of supreme court justice
Antonin Scalia has roiled the US presidential election , but there is one candidate whose campaign seems barely to have been affected : Donald Trump .
While Scaliaâ€ ™ s death dominated the start of Saturdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate and the congressional Republicansâ€ ™ vow to block his replacement meant it instantly became an intensely partisan issue , Trump has rarely focused on the controversy .
In Saturdayâ€ ™ s debate , Trump described Scaliaâ€ ™ s death as â€œa tremendous blow to conservatism .
Itâ€ ™ s a tremendous blow
, frankly , to our country , â€ �
but he has only infrequently raised the issue on the campaign trail , and then in passing .
On Wednesday , in Walterboro , South Carolina , Trump told supporters : â€œIf you get the wrong person [ on the supreme court ] , theyâ€ ™ ll knock out the second amendment so fast your head will spin.â€ �
The Republican frontrunner , who has described himself as having a â€œPhD in litigationâ€ � , has seemed less than engaged with the judicial branch .
While his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Guardian on Saturday that in a Trump administration , â€œthe only litmus test [ for judges ] is you donâ€
™ t legislate from the bench , â€ � on Wednesday
Trump hinted he would appoint justices committed to overturning landmark abortion case Roe v Wade .
And he has previously come under criticism for suggesting that his sister , Maryanne Trump Barry , a federal court of appeals judge , might make a good supreme court pick .
In August he said : â€œI think sheâ€ ™ d be phenomenal .
I think sheâ€ ™ d be one of the bestâ€ � , before her pro - choice record spawned a major backlash from conservatives and he retreated from the notion .
Instead , Trump has stayed focused on his usual talking points like trade , the economy and immigration as well as on â€œcounter punchingâ€ � those who have disparaged him , a group that includes both the pope and Ted Cruz .
In contrast , the supreme court is such a critical issue for Cruz that the Texas senator has made it the center piece of his attacks on Trump .
In an ad entitled Supreme Trust , Cruz â€ “ a former law clerk to ex - chief justice William Rehnquist â€ “ implies Trump canâ€ ™ t be trusted to appoint a conservative justice by focusing on comments Trump made in 1999 saying he was pro - choice .
The ad so got under the real estate mogulâ€ ™
s skin that he threatened to sue Cruz , but it was his conservative bona fides rather than the link to the supreme court that seemed to bother Trump .
Trumpâ€ ™
s supporters did not seem to attach particular importance to the nomination of Scaliaâ€ ™ s replacement .
John Marcoux of North Mt Pleasant said at a Trump event Walterboro on Wednesday that the issue of supreme court appointments paled in comparison to â€œknock[ing ] out all this political correctness that comes from the Frankfurt school notion of critical thinkingâ€ � .
In contrast , Marcoux thought â€œamong all the issues , [ the supreme court ] wasnâ€ ™ t all that importantâ€ � , although he said he felt confident that Trump was â€œobviously not going to appoint a New York liberalâ€ � .
Many other Trump voters simply dismissed the issue altogether .
Joanna Jackson of Charleston said at Kiawah :
â€œI donâ€
™ t think I know enough about it to give you an intelligent answer.â€
�
She said she liked Trump because he would keep taxes low and help the economy .
Cruz , by contrast , has returned to the issue both on the trail and in his stump speech .
He insisted in a press conference on Wednesday that â€œwe should make 2016 a referendum on the supreme courtâ€ � , and at a forum in Greenville on Saturday amplified his concerns about the court : â€œOur very Bill of Rights hangs in balance , one justice away from a five justice radical left wing majority the likes of which our county has never seen.â€
�
The Texas senator warned of the consequences not just of electing a Democratic president
â€ “ â€œevery one of their nominees is a consistent left wing knee jerk voteâ€
�
â€ “ but of other Republicans as well .
â€œWe bat less than .500,â€
�
Cruz said , arguing that Republican presidents nominated â€œmany of the worst judicial activistsâ€ � as well .
Attendees at a Cruz campaign event in Columbia on Tuesday shared his concern .
Tony Burks , an undecided voter , said : â€œI canâ€ ™ t think of anything thatâ€ ™ s more important than [ the supreme court].â€ �
He added that he had thought â€œactivist judgesâ€ � had put the country on the verge of disaster .
Ben Asbury , a Cruz supporter and student at the University of South Carolina , said he supported the Texas senator because â€œhe understands the constitutionâ€ � .
He trusted Cruz to appoint a justice who would follow â€œthe constitution as it was writtenâ€ � .
The question for Cruz , who is in a dogfight with Marco Rubio for second place in South Carolina , is whether this message will make a difference .
The former Texas solicitor general has long emphasized his legal credentials and if undecided voters who have yet to be convinced of the centrality of the courts arenâ€ ™ t sold yet , the question is how they can be in the final day before South Carolinaâ€ ™ s primary ."
2016-02-19,"Broadway Louieâ€ ™ s in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , 11 pm on a Wednesday : thereâ€ ™ s a man singing
Sir Mix A Lotâ€ ™ s
Baby Got Back , and two women dancing with vigor nearby .
I was in town to attend Donald Trump and Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s respective campaign events , which both took place on Friday morning .
Iâ€ ™
d arrived early to soak up some culture , to provide some context .
What would happen when the billionaire collided with the senator here , a city of jet ski shows and afternoons on inner tubes , of biker rallies and a reputation for the real spring break experience ?
Iâ€ ™ ve seen films .
I know how it works .
I wanted to drink Bud Light in a rowdy bar .
I wanted to wear wraparound shades on the top of my head .
I wanted to punch a dweeb in the face and then dive - bomb into a pool .
Ted Cruz and Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s dueling campaigns had given me my chance .
On Friday morning , Cruz seemed ready to get into the spirit of the town .
He showed up with his favorite bro , Phil â€œDuck Dynastyâ€
� Robertson .
The crowd was less into it .
Cruz told them that last weekâ€ ™ s debate had revealed personalities .
He tried out a call - and - response with the audience .
Cruz : â€œWhoâ€ ™ s best prepared to be commander in chief?â€ �
Crowd : an awkward silence .
Then about five people shouted : â€œTed Cruz.â€ � An elderly woman was loudest .
The lackluster atmosphere spread beyond Cruzâ€ ™ s rally .
On my Wednesday night out I had discovered that Myrtle Beach is deathly quiet in February , with plenty of Bud Light but nobody to drink it .
There werenâ€ ™ t any rowdy bars or wraparound shades or compliant dweebs .
The man and women performing Baby Got Back , for example , were in town for a leadership conference .
I wanted to find people other than aspiring management executives â€ “ maybe even some voters
â€ “
so I dipped out of Broadway Louieâ€ ™ s .
A bunch of other bars nearby line the faux downtown area : cobbled streets , old - timey buildings with balconies .
Then I found SeÃ±or Frogs , a chain restaurant and bar ; I hastened inside .
â€œItâ€ ™ s offseason , â€ � the bartender told me .
There were four of us , including the bartender .
I ordered a Bud Light .
This didnâ€ ™ t feel like the full Myrtle Beach experience .
When Donald Trump swept through Myrtle on Friday he probably missed the quiet melancholy that pervades the tourist town in the offseason .
Hundreds of people lined up for Trumpâ€ ™ s event , in a queue that wrapped around the venue and two artificial lakes .
There were thousands more inside .
An attendee named Bill was wearing a hard hat and a high visibility vest , and held a sign saying : â€œIâ€ ™ m ready to work on the wall.â€
�
There were cheers as Trump came out on stage .
The billionaire called Ted Cruz â€œthe biggest liar Iâ€ ™ ve ever seenâ€ � .
Trump alluded to a picture that the Cruz campaign doctored , appearing to show rival Marco Rubio shaking hands with Barack Obama .
He mocked their photoshopping skills .
â€œIâ€
™ m not sticking up for Marco Rubio
but I looked at this picture
: Marco Rubio looked like he was about four feet tall , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI never saw anything like it.â€ � A little later on some protesters started shouting something .
â€œGet them out !
Get them out!â€ �
Trump shouted back .
â€œDonâ€
™ t hurt them but get them out.â€ �
Trump also seemed to dismiss his feud with Pope Francis .
â€œThe pope is great , he made a beautiful statement this morning ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œThey had him convinced that illegal immigration is a wonderful thing , â€ � he added , implying a reference to the popeâ€ ™ s Mexican hosts .
â€œNot wonderful for us , itâ€ ™ s wonderful for Mexico.â€ �
But Cruz got a taste of the offseason at his rally , no thanks to his pal Robertson .
Youâ€ ™
d have thought a â€œduck commanderâ€ � would give an uplifting intro to his favorite senator , but instead Robertson whipped out a Bible and railed against everything Myrtle Beach stands for â€ “ venereal disease , especially .
Sex should be reserved for marriage , he said .
Between one man and one woman .
â€œThen you wonâ€ ™ t get a debilitating disease.â€
�
There are â€œ110 million Americans with STDs at any given timeâ€ � , he added , harshing the already fragile spring - break vibe .
Finally Cruz came out .
â€œJust imagine for a second : Phil Robertson , ambassador to the United Nations , â€ � the senator said .
I think it was a joke .
Then Cruz got fired up .
Very fired up .
He lamented the death of Antonin Scalia .
It made this election all the more important , he said .
â€œOne more justice on the left and the second amendment is written out of the bill of rights .
One more justice on the left and our religious liberty is gone for a generation , â€ � Cruz shouted , with a clenched fist .
He sounded like he was ready to grab his musket and charge at Washington DC , or Hillary Clinton , or any dweeb at the party who couldnâ€ ™ t tell Creed from real Christian rock .
â€œNobody here should be confused what we are fighting for , â€ � Cruz summarized .
â€œWe are fighting for the rights of our children and grandchildren.â€ �
But neither Cruz nor Trump had excited the gang of revelers I met on Wednesday .
Paula Davis and Carol Martinelli , on a â€œgirlsâ€ ™ night outâ€ � , for instance , didnâ€ ™ t know either candidate would be in town .
â€œI liked Trump until he opened his mouth , â€ � Martinelli said .
What came out of Trumpâ€ ™ s mouth ?
â€œPretty much shit
, â€ � she said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re a joke to other countries , â€ � Davis said .
Back inside Louieâ€ ™ s , which seemed to be the only bar in Myrtle Beach with more than 10 people , a woman gave a rousing rendition of Bon Joviâ€ ™ s Livinâ€ ™ on a Prayer .
She wore a sash saying â€œ40 looks goodâ€ � .
Her name was Nesha Madox , and she had travelled to Myrtle Beach from Charlotte â€œto partyâ€ � .
â€œIâ€
™ m scared , â€ � she said , when asked about the election .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no strong candidate .
Theyâ€ ™ re so divisive.â€
�
I asked Madox who she thought was divisive .
She said Donald Trump .
â€œThe way he speaks , I genuinely donâ€ ™ t believe he means what he says .
But the way he says it , people who have hatred seize upon it , â€ � she said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s dividing the country.â€ �
Madox returned to partying and I went for a walk around Louieâ€ ™ s .
The man who had been singing Baby Got Back was called Tiger .
He was 37 .
â€œA lot of [ the election ] is pretty comical , â€ � he said .
â€œSome of the things these guys are out here saying , itâ€ ™ s pretty reckless.â€ �
â€œThe Trumps and others who are fearmongering
â€ ¦
weâ€ ™ re better than that as a nation , as people , â€ � Tiger said .
I asked him what was important in this election .
â€œMinimum wage is a big issue , â€ � he said .
â€œRepublicans are in favor of leaving it where it is .
The reality is that a person working a full - time job on minimum wage , they are below the poverty line.â€ �
I could feel the Bud Light kicking in .
A woman called Melissa came over at the bar and ordered a pint of Stella Artois .
â€œI find politics so exhausting that I would rather crawl up in the fetal position and sleep right through it , â€ � Melissa said .
She said she worked for a â€œbigâ€ � insurance company .
â€œCanâ€
™ t we talk about something more fun?â€ � Melissa asked .
She showed me a picture of her dog , a pug called Rooney , named after Dan Rooney , the chairman and owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers .
She wrote â€œDonald Trump sucksâ€ � in my notepad and stole a pin badge I was wearing .
I left at 1 am .
It was not a classic Myrtle Beach party experience .
Neither I nor anyone else was socked in the jaw .
I never met anyone wearing wraparound shades , failed to dive - bomb into a pool , and didnâ€ ™ t get up to any high jinks at all .
â€œBut , â€ � I thought , as I wobbled back towards a brightly lit building that looked like it might be my hotel , â€œIs that such a bad thing?â€ �"
2016-02-20,"In Nevada , where the white population is 51 % and shrinking , Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders bickered about race on Friday while trying to woo Hispanic and African American voters .
Two thousand miles away in South Carolina , where some of the white population cling to â€œBibles and gunsâ€ � , the six men vying for the Republican presidential nomination stewed over dirty tricks on the campaign trail .
On the eve of the Democratic caucuses in Nevada and the Republican primary in South Carolina , Clinton and Sanders appeared to be running neck - and - neck , while billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump slipped in the polls and support for senator Ted Cruz of Texas surged in the comfort of the evangelical south .
Clinton brought out her entire famous family for a chilly evening rally in Las Vegas as part of a last - ditch effort to get Nevadans out to the caucuses on Saturday morning .
Chelsea Clinton , visibly pregnant , lauded her mother the role model .
Former president Bill Clinton announced that the Latino Victory Project had changed its bylaws to endorse his wife , its first time supporting a non - Hispanic candidate .
But earlier in the day Sanders picked a fight over the issue of race , accusing Clinton of cozying up to Barack Obama , not because she admires him but because she wants to use him to win the black vote .
â€œHillary Clinton now is trying to embrace the president as closely as she possibly can , â€ � Sanders said , according to excerpts from an interview with BET that will broadcast on Sunday .
â€œEverything the president does is wonderful .
She loves the president , he loves her and all that stuff .
â€œAnd we know what thatâ€ ™ s about , â€ � the senator from Vermont continued .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s trying to win support from the African American community where the president is enormously popular.â€ �
Clinton responded via Twitter : â€œ@POTUSâ€ ™ achievements speak for themselves .
The idea that supporting him is a ploy to win black votes is baffling.â€ �
The Clintons were introduced by Hispanic actors America Ferrera and Eva Longoria and joined at the rally by former interior secretary Ken Salazar and Marcia Fudge , an African American member of Congress from the crucial swing state of Ohio .
Stepping away from her usual policy - wonk style , Clinton exhorted her supporters to imagine a tomorrow â€œwhere we finally pass comprehensive immigration
reformâ€
�
, â€œwhere we knock down every barrier that stands in the way of Americans getting ahead and staying
aheadâ€
� , â€œwhere the minimum is not a poverty wageâ€ � .
Meanwhile the State Department released another batch of Clintonâ€ ™ s emails , including 64 now deemed â€œclassifiedâ€ � .
But Sanders , who was expected to face challenges among minority voters as the Democratic nominating contest headed from Nevada southward , got a boost to his image as a longtime advocate and protester for civil rights : late Friday the Chicago Tribune unearthed a photo of Sanders as a 21-year - old activist facing arrest .
As has become custom for his closing rallies on voting eve , more than 2,000 Sanders supporters showed up in Henderson for an event that felt more like a rock concert than a political campaign .
Sara Hughes and her boyfriend Michael Darata , both with giant mohawks , said they showed up because Sandersâ€ ™ message resonated with them : â€œBernie says F - you to the system , like I feel , â€ � Hughes said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s calling people out .
They donâ€ ™ t want to hear it .
They feel threatened by him.â€ �
Sanders added to his stump speech lines aimed at diversity â€ “ that â€œwe are listening to our brothers and sisters in the Latino communityâ€ � , â€œwe are listening to our African - American brothers and sistersâ€ � and â€œwe are listening to the womenâ€ � .
And he laid into the other other opposition : â€œNot only will we fight the racism and the xenophobia and the bigotry of Donald Trump , â€ �
Sanders said to cheers of his name at the mention of another , â€œtogether we are going to demand that Congress pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship.â€ �
In South Carolina , Trumpâ€ ™ s support in one poll dipped below 30 % for the first time this year as Cruz climbed within five points in another .
The real estate mogul has been courting an evangelical state long dubbed â€œBush countryâ€ � by adding to his brash populism a confrontation with the pope and a political dynasty .
Trump walked back his defense against Pope Francis earlier on Friday .
Then he proceeded to double down against Apple , reiterating his calls for a boycott of the companyâ€ ™ s products over an encryption row surrounding the investigation into the mass shooting in San Bernardino , California .
Minutes later the candidate took his boycott to Twitter by way of an iPhone .
â€œApple computer , boycott Apple , â€ �
Trump said at a closing rally in North Charleston .
â€œWe want the secrets .
They donâ€ ™ t want to open up the phones.â€ �
Trump also added a debunked urban legend to his stump speech .
This one was about John Pershing , the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I who , in Trumpâ€ ™ s telling , â€œtook 50 terrorists , and took 50 men and 50 bulletsâ€ � .
The American war hero , whom Trump described as â€œa rough guyâ€ � , apparently then dipped the bullets in pigâ€ ™ s blood .
â€œWe better start getting tough and we better start using our heads , â€ �
Trump said , â€œor we are not going to have a country ,
folks.â€ �
The story seems to stem from Pershingâ€ ™ s stint commanding an American garrison in the Philippines where he helped put down a rebellion on the island of Mindanao .
It also seems to be entirely untrue , despite Trumpâ€ ™ s pledge that â€œthis is something you can read in the history booksâ€
� .
Trump repeated a supporterâ€ ™ s comment at his final rally before the New Hampshire primary , saying that Cruz was â€œa pussyâ€ � for not calling to reinstate waterboarding .
He won in the Granite State , and on Friday in the Palmetto State he described the torture tactic as â€œborderline minimal , minimal tortureâ€ � .
He also said Cruz â€œlies more than any human being I have ever seenâ€ � .
Cruz reportedly met with longshot candidate Ben Carson in a South Carolina storage closet to settle a dispute over allegations that Carsonâ€ ™ s campaign had engaged in â€œdirty tricksâ€ � in Nevada .
And as the race has entered comfortable territory for him â€ “ the Bible belt â€ “ he has fully embraced Americaâ€ ™ s culture wars , ratcheting up his usual rhetoric on second - amendment gun rights and abortion .
The Texas senator , who has a history of arguing before the US supreme court , went all - in this week on his qualifications to select the successor to Antonin Scalia after the justice died on 13 February .
He told a rowdy audience standing under an American flag at an airplane hangar in West Columbia that â€œwe are one justice away from the supreme court striking down every restriction states have placed over the last 40 years on abortionâ€ � .
Later , Cruz expressed disdain for the notion that the second amendment does not guarantee the individual right to bear arms .
In response , a man in the crowd shouted â€œmy cold , dead hands!â€ � , quoting the famous words of the late actor and NRA activist Charlton Heston .
â€œYou and me both , my friend , â€ �
Cruz responded .
On Friday , the reality - TV star Phil Robertson joined Cruz as a warm - up act with a sermon that returned to the countryâ€ ™ s revolutionary roots of how â€œwe wonâ€
� because of two things alone : â€œBibles and guns.â€ �
But Cruz , in a tacit acknowledgment that he was polling behind another reality show veteran , broke his own southern - comfort comedy routine by slipping into a line from Trump : â€œWeâ€ ™ ll be winning so much weâ€ ™ ll be tired of winning ,
â€ � he said .
Charles Starling , the 63-year - old pastor at Hidden Valley Baptist Church in nearby Gaston , repeated Cruzâ€ ™ s lines like the rally was a revival .
Afterward , he said it didnâ€ ™ t take a papal entrance into politics to trust Cruzâ€ ™ s moral values over Trumpâ€ ™ s questionable religious devotion .
â€œI do not know who is saved or who is not â€ “ same goes for Trump , and neither does the pope , â€ � he said .
â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s been saying a lot of the right things , but as far as sincerity , I have a lot of doubts.â€ �
Undecided voters had even more doubts .
And there will likely be a lot of them ; South Carolina election officials are predicting a record turnout .
Patsy George , of Columbia , had just sat through Florida senator Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s final pitch during a rally at the downtown Marriott hotel on Friday , and she said her decision was â€œa toss - upâ€ � between Rubio and Cruz .
On the one hand , George said she found Rubioâ€ ™ s push for a comprehensive immigration reform bill two years ago to be troubling â€ “ even though he has disavowed his prior stance in favor of a more hardline approach .
â€œHopefully heâ€ ™ s learned from what he did before , â€ � she said .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve liked him for years.â€ �
At the same time , George said she was not a fan of what she had heard about Cruz in recent weeks
â€ “ including reports that the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign had spread rumors on the night of the Iowa caucuses that Carson was dropping out of the race in an effort to peel away the retired neurosurgeonâ€ ™ s supporters .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s apologized , but I didnâ€ ™ t like that , â€ �
George said of Cruz .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a little concerned about his presentation .
I donâ€
™ t know how genuine he is.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign is locked in an ongoing feud with Cruz , as the two senators vie for a crucial second - place finish against Trumpâ€ ™ s insurgency .
Earlier this week , the Cruz campaign circulated obviously Photoshopped images of Rubio shaking hands with
Barack Obama â€ “ an anathema in conservative circles .
The Florida senator has warned of more shenanigans beyond those pictures .
This is amid a political climate where Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s Super Pac is spending big on opposition phone calls â€ “ even against the Ohio governor John Kasich who planned to leave the state ahead of Saturdayâ€ ™
s results
â€ “ and the airwaves have been blanketed with ominous messages about the law , guns and money .
As a local poll showed Rubio eclipsing Cruz , a Rubio spokesman suggested a looming Saturday ahead : â€œWe fear the worst dirty tricks are yet to come.â€ �"
2016-02-21,"Donald Trump now has a clear path toward the Republican nomination for the White House after a victory in the South Carolina primary that confirms his insurgent campaign as a political juggernaut .
Frustrated conservatives in the first state to vote in the American south preferred his channeling of populist anger to the platforms of evangelical Texas senator Ted Cruz and the establishment Florida senator Marco Rubio , the Associated Press declared .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing easy about running for president , I can tell you , â€ �
Trump told a rally in Spartanburg .
â€œItâ€ ™ s
tough , itâ€ ™ s mean ,
itâ€ ™ s nasty , itâ€ ™ s vicious â€ ¦ itâ€ ™ s
beautiful.â€ �
He added : â€œWhen you win , itâ€ ™ s beautiful.â€ � Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , the son and brother of two former presidents , dropped out after another disappointing showing in a race that was once thought to be his to lose .
With nearly 93.5 % of the vote reported on Saturday evening , Trump had captured 32.8 % , with Cruz and Rubio battling it out for second place , each with around 22 % of the vote .
Bush , Ohio governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson languished in the single digits .
Trump has been the Republican frontrunner since soon after he announced his bid eight months ago and launched himself into a ceaseless run of controversy , but he has now won two of the first three presidential nominating contests and is starting to build a strong lead among the delegates who officially select the partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
Paired with a closer - than - anticipated finish for the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders behind Hillary Clinton in Nevadaâ€ ™ s Democratic caucus on Saturday , the rise of the outsider in American politics appears to have gained lasting traction with voters .
â€œVoters want to change the way DC functions , â€ �
Trumpâ€ ™ s
campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , said , â€œand the only way to do that is to elect Donald Trump.â€ � The Republicans now switch states with the Democrats and head to Nevada , where Trumpâ€ ™ s casino empire has led him to a more than 20-point lead in polling averages .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re now off to Nevada â€ “
itâ€
™ s a great state , and weâ€ ™ ve got great people ,
â€ �
Trump told his victory rally .
â€œThe only thing that stops the crowds are the walls!â€ �
On the first day of March â€ “ so - called â€œSuper Tuesdayâ€ �
â€ “
a dozen states hold their nominating contests and the once - expansive GOP field may finally start to narrow to a small number of candidates .
Trump has been leading in the polls in almost all of those states except Texas , where Cruz holds a hometown advantage .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s put this thing
away!â€ �
Trump said as he exited the stage in Spartanburg .
The bombastic billionaire had led in nearly every poll in South Carolina despite getting into homestretch fights with Pope Francis and the Bush family .
Lewandowski boasted to reporters on Friday that Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign only spent $ 1.3 m in the state , one - tenth of what Bush and his connected Super Pacs had spent .
Asked by the Guardian before he suspended his campaign outside a polling station in Daniel Island on Friday if he would consider serving as Trumpâ€ ™ s vice - president , Bush said simply : â€œNo.â€ �
â€œA number of the pundits said if a couple of other candidates drop out and add them together , itâ€ ™ s going to equal Trump .
Theyâ€ ™ re geniuses , â€ �
Trump told his victory rally with visible disdain .
He added : â€œThey
donâ€ ™ t understand : as people drop out , I am going to get a lot more votes also.â€ � Ed McMullen , Trumpâ€ ™ s state chair in South Carolina , said the campaign had â€œdispelled a lot of myths : â€˜no ground gameâ€ ™ , â€˜they wonâ€ ™ t come outâ€ ™ , â€˜just there for the showâ€ ™ .
Those myths are all gone .
They turned out hard â€ “ they come out excited and really voted hard for Mr Trump.â€
�
Trump achieved his victory despite repeatedly courting more controversy than usual , from the spat with the pope to a seeming endorsement of war crimes .
To many of his supporters , however , this comes across as straight talk .
At a rally on Wednesday , Joe Bartone , a Trump supporter from Mount Pleasant , said he found Trump â€œa lot smarter than he comes acrossâ€ � .
â€œI like Trump , but he acts like an ass
, â€ � said a sales engineer who would only identify himself as Jason R , as he finished voting for Cruz on Saturday in the suburb of Chapin to South Carolinaâ€ ™ s north - west , where voters expressed a deep distrust of government .
â€œAll politicians are filth , but Cruz is the lesser of all the evils .
Heâ€ ™ s a criminal like the rest of them , but you got ta vote.â€ �
In a state with a reputation for both political dirty tricks and now high turnout , voters witnessed rival candidates repeatedly accusing each other of lying and chicanery .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign sent out a statement on election day accusing Cruz of adopting a â€œstrategy to steal elections through rumors and liesâ€ � .
Trump described Cruz at a campaign rally on Friday night as â€œlying more than any human being I have
ever seenâ€ � .
In return , Cruz dared Trump to sue him and bashed Rubio as not being a true conservative .
Rubio arrived in the state at arguably the lowest point of his campaign , following a disappointing fifth - place finish in New Hampshire on the heels of a disastrous debate performance two days before that primary .
But the senatorâ€ ™ s fortunes changed quickly in South Carolina , beginning with a debate that offered him a shot at redemption going into a critical week for his campaign .
â€œAfter tonight this has become a three - person race , and we will win the nomination ,
â€ �
Rubio told supporters in Columbia .
â€œNow the children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership.â€ �
But the reality remains that he has yet to win a primary contest .
â€œWe are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump , â€ � said Cruz in his speech to supporters in Columbia .
â€œOnly one strong conservative is in a position to win this race.â€ �
In the â€œupstateâ€ � city of Greenville , a 38-year - old mother of four said she was voting for the first time she could remember since turning 18 .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t even think I actually agree with everything Rubio says , but I think he has the best chance here in South Carolina and in the actual election against Hillary , â€ � said the woman , who declined to provide her name for fear of upsetting her family .
â€œI thought about voting for a Democrat , but my husband told me , â€˜No way.â€ ™ â€œI just think itâ€ ™ s kind of crazy that Donald Trump could be president , â€ �
she said .
â€œI figured it would just go away.â€ �"
2016-02-21,"After at least three victory speeches in South Carolina on Saturday night â€ “ delivered with full and earnest conviction , defying the doubters and predicting a surefire path to the presidency â€ “ you could be forgiven for thinking there were at least three Republican winners .
For a country that celebrates its winners and immediately , deliberately forgets its losers , it was a strange turn of events to watch Donald Trump , Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz all give victory speeches after Trumpâ€ ™
s win .
Republicans ( especially Trump ) like to accuse President Obama of trying to turn America into a feeble European - style home of losers ; no one in America celebrates even their respectable defeats quite like the Europeans do .
So watching Rubio and Cruz declare victory despite defeat was much like watching the British crack open champagne to celebrate sixth place at the Olympics .
Donald Trump , the real victor in South Carolina ( and now the clear frontrunner for the nomination ) , was unusually gracious in his victory speech â€ “ not to his rivals , of course , but to his family .
For the first time , Trump willingly surrendered the microphone to his wife Melania Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump .
And not since John Kerryâ€ ™ s nomination has the American voting public had to parse such a thick accent from the spouse of a candidate promising to make America strong again .
Trump initially gave some cursory praise to Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for doing â€œquite wellâ€ �
but , when his supporters booed , he reassured them
this playacting was â€œjust one
secondâ€ � and that â€œtomorrow morning weâ€ ™ ll be back.â€
�
Back to what ?
Back to the type of campaigning he so clearly loves .
â€œItâ€ ™ s tough .
Itâ€ ™ s nasty .
Itâ€ ™ s mean .
Itâ€ ™ s vicious , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s beautiful.â€
�
It turns out that beauty is , like victory , in the eye of the beholder .
Because minutes after Trump finished extolling the beauty of a mean , vicious campaign , the candidates who lost to that campaign pretended , entirely shamelessly , that they had in fact won .
Rubio , who has yet to win a single primary or caucus , proclaimed that he would win the nomination .
â€œThe children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadershipâ€ �
he said , ignoring the uncomfortable fact that no state and no poll has yet handed him said mantle of leadership .
If that wasnâ€ ™ t egotistical enough , Rubio compared his arrival in South Carolina to his Cuban parents arriving in America : â€œTo me , South Carolina will always be the place of new beginnings and fresh starts.â€ �
If losing counts as a fresh start , itâ€ ™ s hard to see how Rubioâ€ ™ s speechwriters would describe his excitement in the unlikely prospect of success .
If he comes first in New Mexico , will Rubio begin his own inauguration parade straight to Washington DC ?
Ted Cruz , in his defeat - as - victory speech , at least made an attempt to identify who or what he had beaten so convincingly .
It turns out that Cruz came first against something called Expectations , a cruel and ugly opponent determined to snuff out the very spirit of America .
Cruz explained how he had won in Iowa .
But since that was a few weeks ago , he couldnâ€ ™ t countenance that being his only win , so he explained how he had also â€œdefied expectationsâ€ � in New Hampshire .
And now South Carolina had â€œgiven us another remarkable result.â€
�
â€œRemarkableâ€ � is how you describe a friendâ€ ™ s performance in a play youâ€ ™
d rather forget .
Cruz also declared victory in his effort to end Obamacare , which ( as we all know ) would certainly have been a remarkable result for the Texas senator in a one - state primary election .
â€œWe will not go quietly into the night and give up on a brighter Americaâ€ �
he said , in perhaps the truest statement to emerge from his lips : quiet , Cruz is not .
The man who truly lost _ and had the honesty to admit it _ was the former establishment pick known as Jeb!.
The Bush dynasty threw all its generational power behind its second son , and its donors threw more than $ 100 million on top of that , all to no avail .
So Bush gave a tender appreciation of his wife and family , and conceded to what his rivals refuse to acknowledge : reality .
For their part , those rivals could barely tell the truth about Bush himself .
Cruz said that Bush had not lowered himself to â€œthe gutterâ€ � with â€œinsults and attacksâ€ � which conveniently ignored Bushâ€ ™ s debate performance , his Twitter trolling and his Super PACâ€ ™ s ads .
Rubio praised Bush as â€œthe greatest governor in the history of Floridaâ€ � but conceded that he hadnâ€ ™ t yet spoken to him , probably because they are reportedly no longer on speaking terms .
Itâ€ ™
s hard to see how even one of two such delusional candidates â€ “ Rubio and Cruz â€ “ can bring themselves to stand aside and support the other to stop Donald Trump .
But if neither man can , they will be celebrating defeat for many weeks to come .
And as the great orange hope of the Republican party put it on Saturday night , thatâ€ ™ s â€œbeautifulâ€ �
â€ “ at least , it is if youâ€ ™ re either a Democrat or Donald Trump ."
2016-02-22,"Ted Cruz has finished speaking in Reno , so hereâ€ ™ s where we stand on the eve of the Nevada caucuses : Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio spent the day trading jabs , following the firing by Cruz of a spokesman who tweeted a fake video purporting to show Rubio saying there â€œwerenâ€ ™ t answersâ€ � in the bible Donald Trump gave plenty of red meat to an audience of 8,000 in Las Vegas , including saying he wanted to punch a protester â€œin the faceâ€ � Ted Cruz tacked sharply to the right on immigration , telling Fox Newsâ€ ™ Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly that he would deport all 12 million illegal immigrants Rubio picked up endorsements from a wide swath of the Republican establishment following Bushâ€ ™ s dropping out of the race , including former vice presidential candidate Bob Dole Glenn Beck described himself as a â€œnutjobâ€ � Cruz compares Obama to Jimmy Carter .
â€œSame failed economic policies .
Same feckless and naive foreign policies.â€ � â€œNow why does that analogy give me so much hope and optimism , â€ � he asks .
Heâ€ ™ s comparing himself to Reagan .
â€œItâ€
™ s easy , by the way , to say you want to make America great again
, â€ � Cruz says .
â€œYou can even print it on a baseball cap .
But the question to ask is : do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place?â€
�
Heâ€ ™ s telling his regulator / pesticide joke again .
The joke is that the farmer wants to use pesticide on federal employees .
To kill them .
â€œWe will not weaken ; we will not degrade ; we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS.â€ � Ted Cruz promising â€œcommon - sense healthcare reformâ€ � that â€œstops government getting between us.â€ �
He promises to stop Common Core .
â€œWe will finally , finally , finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities.â€
�
â€œNow Iâ€ ™ ve been told you folks in Nevada like your guns , â€ � says Cruz .
â€œLet me say as a Texan :
I understand.â€
�
The crowd whoops and claps .
â€œWe are one liberal justice away from the Supreme Court wiping away the second amendment and removing our right to bear arms , â€ � Cruz says .
Cruz calls late supreme court justice Antonin Scalia a â€œlion of a manâ€ � . â€œLast week , Donald Trump says he intends to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians , â€ � says Cruz .
â€œI have no intention of staying neutral.â€ � â€œIf you look at the roots of the word politics , there are two parts : poli , meaning many , and tics , meaning parasites ,
â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œAnd that is a fairly accurate description of Washington DC .
He says there is â€œa spirit of awakening that is sweeping this country.â€ �
Asks everyone to look forward to January 2017 .
â€œIf I am elected president , let me tell you what I intend to do on my first day in office.â€ �
The audience shouts â€œwhen!â€ � â€œIf and when , â€ � Cruz corrects himself .
He promises to reverse every single of Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions .
â€œThe second thing I intend to do is to instruct the department of justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood , and persecute those responsible .
Itâ€ ™ s possible he meant prosecute rather than persecute , but then itâ€ ™ s possible he meant what he said .
â€œHow do you define a progressive : thereâ€ ™ s an easy test , â€ � says Cruz .
â€œThey donâ€
™ t understand the scariest words in the English language : â€˜Iâ€ ™ m from the government and Iâ€ ™ m here to helpâ€ ™ .â€ � â€œHow about Glenn Beck , â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œIsnâ€ ™ t Glenn Beck extraordinary.â€ � â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing elected officials like less than being held accountable for their words and actions , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œBut thatâ€ ™ s the best thing about the people : holding elected officials accountable.â€ � Boos for the first mention by Cruz of Marco Rubio .
â€œGod bless the great state of Nevada , â€ � he says .
â€œWhat an incredible pleasure this is .
Thank you for coming out tonight ;
what a privilege.â€ �
Trump , from earlier , on wanting to punch protesters in the face : Beck still talking .
Garner the trainee guide dog puppy has gone to sleep .
But he seems to be getting around to the subject of Ted Cruz , so there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
Glenn Beck still talking .
He just did a lengthy bit where he explained the internet to an invisible George Washington .
Trumpâ€ ™ s finished his speech in Las Vegas .
It sounds like it was pretty wild .
Now Beckâ€ ™ s doing an impression of George Washingtonâ€ ™ s mother .
This is , if nothing else , at least entertaining .
â€œPlease heed this warning : there are many people running - Donald Trump is dangerous , â€ � says Glenn Beck in Reno , illustrating the adage that even a stopped clock is right twice a day .
Trump , who earlier today told reporters that he and the Pope were OK now , reviving his spat with Rome .
Glenn Beck is currently on stage at the Ted Cruz rally , claiming to have predicted 9/11 but â€œnobody listened.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m a nutjob , â€ � he shouts .

Meanwhile , back in Vegas , Trump is really hitting his stride .
By most measures , Marco Rubio should be running away with the race for the Republican nomination in Nevada , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Richard Wolffe .
Of all the Republicans left in the contest , the senator from Florida has a unique connection to Nevadaâ€ ™ s culture and voters .
He lived in Las Vegas for three years as a child , until the age of 11 , during which time he also embraced the Mormon faith that is popular in a state that borders Utah .
Fully one quarter of GOP caucus - goers in the last presidential election were Mormon .
( It was only later that the young Rubio convinced his family to leave the Church of Latter - day Saints to convert to Catholicism . )
In a state where Latinos make up 27 % of the population , Rubio â€ “ as the only bilingual candidate in the field â€ “ should be making deep inroads into Nevada .
So how come Rubio is faring so poorly in a state he once called home , Wolffe asks .
Much of the answer lies in Rubioâ€ ™ s pitch to voters .
At the heart of his campaign is a perfectly delivered stump speech that sells one idea : the American dream .
Beyond his personal story of struggling with student debt , and his parentsâ€ ™ story as working - class immigrants , Rubioâ€ ™ s platform amounts to no more than motherhood and apple pie .
Yes , he delivers the now standard Republican promise to repeal Obamacare , increase military spending , lower taxes and beat Hillary Clinton .
But his ideas are so vacuous he makes Trumpâ€ ™ s stump speech sound like a seminar at the Brookings Institution .
You can read the full article here .
Speaker of the house Paul Ryan is on Fox News right now , filled with optimism about the November elections :
Hereâ€ ™ s a livestream of Trump in Las Vegas - there are 16,000 people watching this stream alone .
Donald Trump , in Vegas , striking out at Ted Cruz , who is set to come on stage in Reno soon :
Trump still going strong : Crucial update from your faithful reporter at the back of the crowd at the Ted Cruz rally in Reno , where the support speakers have begun :
A mark of a Donald Trump rally is how often he has protesters ejected .
Itâ€ ™ s happening again in Vegas right now
: Another regular occurrence is attacks on the media - again , Trump in Vegas is staying true to usual form .
Another update from Ben Carsonland : On Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly today , Ted Cruz noticeably hardened his stance on illegal immigration .
According to the Dallas Morning News : Ted Cruz said tonight that he would use federal immigration officers to round up and deport all 12 million people in the country illegally â€ ” a markedly tougher stance that he has struck in the past .
â€œYes , we should deport them , â€ �
Cruz told Fox host Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what ICE exists for .
We have law enforcement that looks for people who are violating the laws , that apprehends them and deports them.â€ � Cruz also appeared on Hugh Hewitt today , and addressed the Rick Tyler incident in more detail :
It was unfortunate that that had to occur .
Rick is a good man , and he has worked hard on this campaign , but Rick forwarded on social media a story that was written in the press that falsely attributed some negative sentiments by Marco Rubio about the Bible , and it turned out the story was false , and even more fundamentally , even if the story was true , we shouldnâ€ ™ t be forwarding it on , that from the very beginning of this campaign , I told every member of this campaign , we are going to run this campaign with the highest level of integrity and
doesnâ€ ™ t matter if others engage in attacks
, if others engage in insults , we are not going to go personal , we are going to stay focused on issues and substance , and we are not going to impugn the faith of any candidate and that unfortunately is what this tweet is impugning Marcoâ€ ™ s faith .
That was wrong , and itâ€ ™ s not something that the campaign is going to tolerate .
It wasnâ€ ™ t done maliciously , but it was a serious error of judgment and thatâ€ ™ s why I asked for his resignation today because that is not conduct that will be tolerated on our campaign .

Another view of the Trump crowd : Trump is speaking .
Jon Huntsman update : his daughter Abby , who is an anchor and reporter on Fox News , has taken to Twitter to say that people are taking her fatherâ€ ™ s comments to CNN somewhat too far :
Meanwhile , the crowd for Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally in Reno is increasing - though nowhere near Trumpâ€ ™ s size in Vegas .
In front of an enormous crowd .
Big though the crowd may be at the Cruz rally in Reno , itâ€ ™ s likely to be nothing compared to the arena crowd in Las Vegas for Donald Trump .
Warm - up speakers for Trump have begun .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Dave Schilling is on the scene at the Trump rally .
On the Hugh Hewitt show earlier today , Donald Trump sounded a rare note of caution about tomorrowâ€ ™ s caucuses .
Iâ€ ™ m in Nevada now , and I think you know , based on the polls , but of course , you never know what happens here .
A lot of strange things happen here , and the caucus system is dangerous , to use a very nice word .
Itâ€ ™ s sort of a dangerous system .
But weâ€ ™ ll see what happens .
We should do pretty well tomorrow .
Trump also took the opportunity to pile in on Ted Cruz , saying his campaign â€œhad a lot of problems with himâ€ � and describing the Texas senator as â€œa person that doesnâ€ ™ t like telling the truth.â€ �
Then you see the other things .
Heâ€
™ s done things with me that are incredible .
You know , he did two robo - calls on election day in South Carolina , on election day , and they were terrible .
One was on the confederate flag , and the other one was on , I believe , gay marriage .
And they were very , very rough , and very , very unethical to do .
He plays hardball , but , and I like hardball , and Iâ€ ™ ve met a lot tougher people than him , believe me , many , many , many times tougher .
But he has a real hard time with the truth .

Doors have just opened for Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally in Reno .
The person on the door at first tried to turn away your faithful Guardian reporter - â€œyouâ€ ™ re on the do - not - let - in listâ€
� was what he said - but the banishment appeared to be overturned by a supervisor .
The queue outside is large - a big crowd is expected .
Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs has brought this lovely piece by Ashley Parker in the New York Times to our attention .
Headlined â€œVoters might not miss Jeb Bush , but campaign reporters will ,
â€ � the piece says : By the time I was assigned to cover Jeb Bush , he was already becoming the exclamation mark that couldnâ€ ™ t .
Even his gait â€ ” long - limbed and newly gangly courtesy of the Paleo diet â€ ” and the way he seemed to curl slightly into his 6-foot-4 frame told the story : A campaign that was supposed to be â€œjoyfulâ€ � had become a slog .
He had taken to handing out small toy turtles to children he met along the way , in what often felt like a parable intended just for him
â€
” maybe slow and steady
could , still , win the race .
Ultimately , the end came painfully , as he finished fourth in the South Carolina primary on Saturday , yet another disappointment in a year full of them .
The nation , simply , did not want what he was selling .
But his presence will be missed in the 2016 race among those of us who covered him .
Even as he stumbled as a candidate , he was , in many ways , a reporterâ€ ™ s dream .
He held news conferences so frequently â€ ” nearly daily â€ ” that their absence felt newsworthy .
And he seemed constitutionally incapable of not answering questions , even those he should not have .
As aides tried to hustle him away , he would often pause and turn back , or roll down his car window , to give a final response , throwing political caution to the wind .
He gave out his email address easily and freely and , early on , even responded to queries sent there .
He could be curt with voters , and rarely coddled them .
People who saw him speak in person almost always went away impressed , even if they were not convinced that they should vote for him .
He was your goofy dad , your awkward uncle .
He bungled a policy rollout in Nevada when he called â€œSupergirlâ€ � â€œhotâ€ �
( câ€ ™ mon , Dad ! ) , he was delightfully befuddled when his Apple Watch began ringing during a meeting with an Iowa newspaper , and he wiggled into a hoodie in a shaky YouTube video .

Former ambassador and presidential candidate Jon Huntsman has told CNNâ€ ™ s David Axelrod that he â€œcould get behindâ€ � Donald Trump as presidential candidate .
â€œIf heâ€
™ s the nominee , Iâ€ ™ m a Republican
and I tend to gravitate towards whomever
the nominee is , â€ � the former ambassador to China told Axelrod .
Heâ€ ™ s strong on things like campaign finance reform
and I think
itâ€ ™ s going to take an extraordinarily unique leader to stand up and say that the way that weâ€ ™ re doing this on the campaign finance side is broken and we need to fix it .
Iâ€ ™
d love to see someone stand up whoâ€ ™ s a total outsider and see if that can be done because I think it would actually be a pretty healthy thing .
You can listen to the full podcast on CNNâ€ ™ s website here .
More from Ben Carson , who just released a statement to remind his supporters that yes , he is still running for president .
Heâ€ ™ s on the Oâ€ ™ Reilly factor on Fox News right now ,
where he says that things â€œcould turn around pretty quickly.â€ � â€œBill Clinton didnâ€ ™ t win anything until his sixth contest , â€ �
he adds .
Interesting
: Roll Call is reporting that rep .
Joe Heck , the top Republican candidate for the senate from Nevada , will not be caucusing for any candidates tomorrow .
Ahead of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s Nevada Republican presidential caucuses ,
Rep. Joe Heck , the top Republican Senate candidate , was not in the state on Monday and did not plan to be there on Tuesday , either .
His office said he was on the East Coast as Congress begins to trickle back from the Presidents Day recess .
Ryan Erwin , the former executive director of the Nevada Republican Party and the top strategist on Heckâ€ ™ s campaign , said
Heckâ€ ™ s approach in the race was a focused one : â€œKeep your head down and get the job
done.â€ � â€œWe need to work with whoever the nominee is .
We have enough to do to win this race than to get neck - deep in other politics , â€ �
he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a race that has shifted so many times .
For us to worry about how that shift might impact the electorate in our race doesnâ€ ™ t make sense.â€ �
Unlike Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Patrick J. Toomey , who endorsed Marco Rubio , or Ohioâ€ ™ s
Rob Portman , who endorsed his home state governor John Kasich , despite being locked in tough races
, Heck has adopted the approach of New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte , staying quiet as the presidential circus went through town .
Heck , who could still face a Republican challenger , is walking a fine line in trying to placate the conservative base while keeping an eye on a general election electorate whose support would be harder to earn on a GOP ticket headlined by a candidate such as Donald Trump .

Genn Beck is currently speaking at Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally in Elko , Nevada .
Cruz is expected to speak there soon .
Meanwhile , in Ben Carson - land ... The Cruz vs Rubio spat is getting nastier by the minute .
Possibly in response to those biting comments from Rubioâ€ ™ s spokesman that Rick Tyler was â€œa really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected , â€ � the Cruz camp is now striking back at Marco Rubio in a memo titled , in all - caps , â€œTED CRUZ IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO CAN BEAT DONALD
TRUMPâ€ � .
In the memo , Jason Johnson , Cruzâ€ ™ s chief strategist , writes : Three states into the Republican nominating process , the field has narrowed from seventeen to five candidates .
And of the five candidates remaining , only three are viable : Cruz , Trump and Rubio .
Marco Rubio can not beat Trump .
Trump canâ€ ™ t be beaten from the political Left , with a candidate who emphatically supports amnesty and who allows Trump to be considered the â€œconservativeâ€ � in that context .
Rubio has yet to win a primary state .
On This Week with George Stephanopoulos , Senator Rubio was asked simply ,
â€œwhat state can you win?â€ � Rubio replied , Florida on March 15 .
Rubioâ€ ™ s stated strategy is to lose the first four primary states , lose every state on Super Tuesday , then lose every state on March 5 , then lose every state on March 8 , and then finally win in Florida ( where heâ€ ™ s currently polling third , behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz ) .
Johnson goes on to say that â€œBy March 15 , 26 states or territories will have voted , and Rubio does not plan to win any of them .
Almost 50 % of the delegates will have already been allocated ; Rubio will win almost none , and then heâ€ ™ ll hope for resurrection in Florida .
Thatâ€ ™ s an even less plausible path to victory than Mayor Rudy Giulianiâ€ ™ s â€œwait for Floridaâ€ � strategy in 2008.â€ �

Itâ€ ™ s raining endorsements today for Marco Rubio , reports Sabrina Siddiqui .
Senator Dan Coats of Indiana is the latest to jump on board .
Earlier , Rubio got the endorsement of senators Jeff Flake Orrin Hatch , and the second - hand , lightly used , still in good working condition endorsement of former vice - presidential candidate Bob Dole , who had previously backed Bush .
Maria La Ganga has investigated the possible reasons why , despite his lead in the polls , Donald Trump could lose here in Nevada tomorrow : his lack of a ground game .
Donald Trump has one of the smallest and least organized ground campaigns in Nevada , according to Republican officials and operatives in the state , raising questions about the billionaireâ€ ™ s readiness for another caucus - based contest after his disappointing second - place finish in Iowa .
Texas senator Ted Cruz beat the brash real estate mogul in Iowaâ€ ™ s Republican contest with help from evangelical Christians and a superior network of volunteers ; such workers are critical in states such as Nevada and Iowa , which choose their presidential nominees through a complicated caucus system .
Donald Trump leaves supporters cold as he accuses Rubio of â€˜excess sweatingâ€
™ Read more Eight days after his bruising loss , Trump won the New Hampshire primary , declaring : â€œWe learned a lot about ground game in a week.â€ � The big question is whether he has learned enough .
Although the answer wonâ€ ™ t become clearer until the Republican caucuses inNevada on 23 February , following the South Carolina primary on Saturday , the reality television star appears to be lagging behind his better organized competitors in reaching out to Nevadaâ€ ™ s hard - to - corral caucus - goers .
â€œElections are won on organization , â€ � said Adam Khan , chairman of the Washoe County Republican Central Committee .
â€œTrump has a lot of popularity , but if you look at the ground operation here , he just doesnâ€ ™ t have it.â€ �
Exhibit A :
Trumpâ€ ™ s rally on 10 January at the downtown Reno Ballroom .
It could have been a campaign managerâ€ ™
s dream â€ “ 3,000 or so cheering supporters , an energized army ready to be harnessed
, a data trove for the all - important get - out - the - vote effort .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s staff did not record e - mail addresses or phone numbers that day from the captive audience of potential donors , caucus - goers and volunteers .
The rally became a squandered opportunity six weeks out from the caucuses .
When asked about that campaign blunder , Trumpâ€ ™ s Nevada state director Charles Munoz replied : â€œIâ€ ™ ll have headquarters get back to you , or Iâ€ ™ ll get back to you.â€ �
So far , that has not happened .
The Best Ground Game award here , Republican political consultant Erik Jimanez told Maria , goes to Marco Rubio .
Heâ€
™ s got a large number of campaign staff in Las Vegas and Reno .
Theyâ€ ™ re doing a lot of outreach to the rural counties , which are tremendous in terms of who shows up on caucus day , much higher rates than in urban areas.â€ �

A quick break from Nevada and the Republicans for a second : Atlantaâ€ ™ s
Channel 2 Action News has just released a poll showing that Hillary Clinton has a commanding lead in Georgia over Bernie Sanders , with 72 percent to the Vermont senatorâ€ ™ s 19.8 .
Georgia is one of the 12 states - and one territory - which vote on March first : â€œSuper Tuesday.â€ �
More from Cruz Nevada campaign chair Adam Laxalt
: On the subject of the Rick Tyler controversy , he said : â€œThey made the decision to move on with the communication director .
Thatâ€ ™ s just is a strong statement of how important integrity is to Cruz and to the campaignâ€ ¦ .â€
�
Asked about Trump and his campaignâ€ ™ s behavior during the nominating process , Laxalt said , â€œI think thereâ€ ™ s absolutely a double standard .
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of stuff that happens with these huge presidential candidates ...
Thereâ€ ™ s no accountability on all sides .
â€œCruz tends to take the lionâ€ ™ s share of attacks from the media whenever anything is happening , â€ � the stateâ€ ™ s attorney general said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s challenging .
But despite all that , thereâ€ ™ s a huge reservoir of consistent support in this state and across the country.â€ �
My colleagues Sabrina Siddiqui , Maria La Ganga and Ben Jacobs have gone into much more detail on the scandal that led to Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s firing .
Cruz sacked Rick Tyler , his national spokesman , after he circulated a video on Sunday that allegedly showed Rubio walking by a Cruz staffer in a hotel lobby who was holding a Bible .
Although the audio was fuzzy , some assumed Rubio to have remarked : â€œGot a good book there , not many answers in it.â€
�
In fact , Rubio had said â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
â€œThis morning I asked for Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s resignation , â€ �
Cruz told reporters in Las Vegas over his promotion of a news story that falsely claimed his rival said â€œsomething negative about the Bibleâ€ � .
â€œThis was a grave error of judgment , â€ � he said .
â€œIt turned out the news story he sent around was false .
But Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , even if it was true , we are not a campaign that will question the faith of another candidate.â€
�
They also spoke to a spokesman for the Rubio campaign , Alex Conant , who reacted to the news by saying Tyler is â€œa really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get electedâ€ � .
Owch .
They conclude that the Tyler firing â€œsuggests Cruz may believe his campaign is vulnerable to the emerging narrative that he is a candidate willing to play dirty â€ “ a troublesome accusation for a candidate seeking to appeal to the religious right.â€ �
You can read the full story here .
The controversy which led to his firing of campaign spokesman Rick Tyler does not appear to have dampened the enthusiasm of Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s diehard supporters , as this video shot by Maria La Ganga outside his Las Vegas rally this afternoon shows : Maria also was there for a candid briefing from Adam Laxalt , the Cruz campaign chairman in Nevada and the stateâ€ ™ s attorney general , where he sought to manage expectations about the Texanâ€ ™ s performance in the Battle Born state .
Talking to reporters after Cruzâ€ ™ s Las Vegas rally midday Monday , he stressed Rubioâ€ ™ s ties to the state .
â€œRubio should win this state , â€ � Laxalt said , as supporters mobbed Cruz for selfies and handshakes in a YMCA gymnasium .
â€œRubioâ€ ™ s from here , he was raised here , heâ€ ™ s got family here and heâ€ ™ s campaigned here .
So there should be an expectation that he should beat Trump here .
â€œWith the caucus , it is so unknown who turns out , â€ � Laxalt continued .
In the 2012 Republican caucuses , â€œwe only had 33,000 show up in the state , 16,000 from here , Clark County .
Who turns out is up to anyoneâ€
™ s guess .
I think if conservatives turn out , the Cruz is in a very , very good position.â€ �
Laxalt said he has toured the state on Cruzâ€ ™ s behalf and â€œthere were a lot of folks that didnâ€ ™ t even know we had a caucus .
â€
¦ I think
thatâ€ ™ s one disadvantage we face .
A lot of voters just arenâ€ ™ t in tune with the caucus.â€ �
Laxalt said Cruz planned to travel 750 miles on Monday , the day before the Republican caucuses , from Las Vegas to Reno to Elko , along with other small , rural towns in Nevadaâ€ ™ s vast outback .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve had to change venues ,
â€ � he said .
â€œEverythingâ€ ™ s sold out , people are excited.â€ �
Nate Cohn , over at the New York Times , makes an interesting spot regarding the new voter registrations following the Iowa caucuses .
Outside the Rubio rally I catch up with a few supporters .
Brooke Sullivan is the manager of a cattle ranch in Reno ; she says that before seeing the senator speak she was on the fence
- â€œbut now
Iâ€
™ m convinced to vote ; he rocked my socks.â€
�
Sheâ€ ™ ll be caucusing for him tomorrow .
Several people here werenâ€ ™ t impressed by what they called â€œdirty tricksâ€ � by the Cruz team .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t like anything heâ€
™ s done , â€ � Sullivan says .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want a president whoâ€ ™ s constantly apologising - these things are not done by mistake , so
either heâ€ ™ s giving a back door wink , or hiring bad people.â€ �
Janelle LaFleur , a housekeeping manager at a Reno hotel , had just caught up on the news about Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s firing when I speak to her .
â€œItâ€ ™ s horrible ,
â€ � she says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s nice to see that [ Cruz ] has taken care of it - but
itâ€ ™ s his campaign.â€ � â€œYou donâ€ ™ t see Marco Rubio doing things like that , â€ � she adds .
In Reno , Rubio , who has just finished speaking , was recounting his personal story - he was born in Las Vegas ; his mother was a maid , his father a bartender .
Itâ€ ™ s a story
thatâ€ ™ s resonating extremely well here .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have a lot of work to do together .
But weâ€ ™ re going to do it , â€ � Rubio is saying in Reno .
It wonâ€ ™ t be easy , he says , but â€œthere has never been a time when America had it easy.â€ � Each generation before us had problems , and they solved their problems . ...
Today , America is governed by the most selfish leaders in the history of the republic .
The crowd again chants â€œMarco !
Marco!â€ � â€œThere are other people in this race - Iâ€ ™ ve gotten to know them really well over 44 debates
, â€ � he jokes .
â€œI like them ,
I do.â€
�
But , he says , there canâ€ ™ t be two Republican nominees .
â€œJust one.â€ �
â€œWhen youâ€ ™ re president you canâ€
™ t be a divisive figure ,
â€ � he says , obliquely striking at Trump and Cruz while couching it in critiques of Obama .
Rubio says he wants to campaign â€œin a way that does not necessitate pitting us against each other.â€ � Applause in the room .
Some sad news : Missouri senator Claire McCaskill has just announced , in a blog post , that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer - though
, happily , she says that she has been told by doctors that she is going to make a full recovery .
Her statement : I very recently learned that I have breast cancer .
It was detected through a regular mammogram .
Itâ€ ™ s a little scary , but my prognosis is good and I expect a full recovery .
I will be in St Louis for the next 3 weeks receiving treatment .
During this time my staff will continue to assist Missourians and I will be posting on my Senate website ( McCaskill.senate.gov ) how I would have voted on any matters that come before the Senate during my absenceâ€”which Iâ€ ™ ll also enter into the Congressional record .
Additionally , Iâ€ ™ ll be submitting questions in writing for any missed Senate hearings .
Thank you for the honor of serving you in the Senate .
In Vegas , Cruz is hitting out more at the President than his Republican rivals - not surprising , considering how much humble pie heâ€ ™ s been forced to eat today by Rubio and Trump over his now ex - spokesmanâ€ ™ s tweet .
â€œIf we nominate somebody that 40 to 50 percent of our party
canâ€
™ t stand , we are going to lose to Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders , â€ � Rubio says .
Then , he makes his pitch : We have to nominate someone who will bring us together , and I will bring us together faster than anyone else .
We have to nominate someone not just who can bring us together , but someone who can bring new people in .
He points out that his mother was a maid ; says when he stays at hotels on the campaign trail , the maids he meets know that .
â€œWe have to take that message to them.â€
�
This part is crucial : â€œWe have to tell them that what they hear about Republicans , about us only caring about the rich , is a lie : because , look at where I come from.â€ � â€œRubio victory!â€ � someone in the crowd calls out .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re messing with my train of thought here , â€ � Rubio says , grinning .
â€œYou know how much I love to repeat myself now
I have to repeat myself
again!â€ � Back in Reno , Rubio is hitting his stump speech talking - points beautifully .
Hitting out at Bernie Sanders .
â€œA few weeks ago I started saying Bernie Sanders should be president of Sweden ,
â€ � he says .
â€œAnd then Sweden got mad .
Then I started saying he should be president of Norway .
Then Norway got mad.â€
�
The audience laughs heartily .
The tone is ebullient .
And you can watch a livestream here :
â€œI know youâ€ ™ re here today because youâ€ ™ re worried about the future of your county , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œYou should be.â€ � â€œMarco !
Marco!â€ � the crowd chants .
â€œDonâ€
™ t say polo , â€ � the Florida senator jokes .
â€œThat game tortured me as a child.â€ � Donald Trump is piling in on Cruz too over Rick Tylerâ€ ™
s
tweet :
Rubio is due to speak in Reno soon .
Earlier , he spoke out obliquely against the actions of Rick Tyler .
Rick Tyler , the former national spokesman for the Ted Cruz campaign , was asked to resign by Cruz on Monday .
According to Politico : Cruz cited a social media posting from Tyler on Sunday about a comment Marco Rubio supposedly made about the Bible .
â€œOur campaign should not have sent it .
Thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ ve asked for Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s resignation , â€ � Cruz said .
The Texas senator was speaking to reporters on Monday , and said heâ€ ™ s spent the morning investigating what happened .
Tyler was on TV this morning apologising for his post . ...
but it doesnâ€ ™ t appear to have been enough .
Hello and welcome to
this afternoonâ€ ™ s
live coverage of the eve of the Nevada Republican caucuses .
Iâ€ ™ m Nicky Woolf , and Iâ€ ™ m in Reno , Nevada , taking over the blog from my colleague Amber Jamieson .
We have an action - packed afternoon for you as we gear up for this crucial first - in - the - west caucus .
Marco Rubio , who is picking up endorsements from previous Bush supporters left , right , and center , is about to speak at a campaign stop in Reno .
Later today , Donald Trump will be speaking in Las Vegas , and Iâ€ ™ ll be at a Ted Cruz rally tonight here in Reno .
Theoretically , itâ€ ™ s possible
Ben Carson might make an appearance too .
But donâ€ ™ t hold your breath .
As the great Ira Glass says : stay with us .
BREAKING :
Ted Cruz just announced he asked one of his top staffers , spokesman Rick Tyler , to resign after pushing a story that said opponent Marco Rubio criticized the Bible .
As we explained earlier this morning , the story stems from a video with pretty crappy audio , where Rubio walks past a Cruz staffer and compliments him for reading a the bible but then says , according to the subtitles of the YouTube clip : â€œNot many answers in it .
Especially in that one.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s team declared the story totally bananas , saying their candidate said the holy book had â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
Tyler apologized in a Facebook statement earlier this morning : Iâ€ ™ ve deleted the post because I would not knowingly post a false story .
But the fact remains that I did post it when I should have checked its accuracy first .
I regret the mistake .
And now he has been forced to resign .
A new poll from Vermont shows very , very strong support for hometown hero Bernie Sanders in the Democrat primary -- while Trump is poised to win the stateâ€ ™ s Republican vote .
The VPR poll shows Sanders winning 84 % of the Democrat vote , compared to just 9 % for Hillary Clinton .
Sandersâ€ ™ support jumps to a whopping 95 % when counting only voters between 18 - 39 .
While itâ€ ™ s no surprise that Sanders would win his home state , Clinton won 38 % of the Democrat primary vote in Vermont back in 2008 .
Of the 151 Republicans that responded , 32 % said they support Trump .
Rubio sits in second place , with 16 % .
The poll was conducted between Feb. 3 and Feb. 17 and had 895 responses from across Vermontâ€ ™ s 14 counties .
The margin of error rate is 3.3 % .
GOP establishment feels the Rubiomentum One of the most consequential political science works about modern American politics is
â€œThe Party Decidesâ€ � which advances the thesis that party insiders often decide who the nominee is before voters do so .
And , if the party still decides , itâ€ ™ s clear they are picking Marco Rubio .
In the aftermath of Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s decision to drop out of the Republican primary on Saturday night , GOP insiders are flocking to back Rubio .
Former Kansas senator and 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole announced his support for Rubio on Monday .
Dole , the epitome of a party elder , had previously backed Jeb Bush .
Doleâ€ ™ s endorsement is the latest that Rubio has recieved in the past 48 hours .
In addition to the nonagenarian former Senate majority leader , he has been endorsed by three senators , Dean Heller of Nevada , Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona , Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas as well as a half dozen House members and other party luminaries like former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty .
Despite not winning a single primary so far , Rubio , whose best finish is razor thin second place over Ted Cruz in South Carolina , is clearly consolidating establishment support as alternative to Cruz and Donald Trump .
However , Rubio still doesnâ€ ™ t have the establishment lane to himself .
Ohio governor John Kasich is still in the race and hoping to pick off delegates on March 1 states in advance of the Michiganâ€ ™ s primary on March 8 .
Kasich has picked up a handful of additional endorsements in the past two days as well including former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge .
â€œWhen
I look at you , I donâ€
™ t see happiness , â€ � a supporter said to John Kasich during this morningâ€ ™ s campaign event in Fairfax , Virginia .
Kasich quickly said this campaign made him â€œjoyous.â€ �
However , there was also an acceptance of the unlikeliness of him winning the nomination , saying he doesnâ€ ™ t pray to win , but instead prays â€œto be able to accept whatever is meant to be and carry out whatever the next responsibility I have
is.â€ �
The more I read the sentence
â€œWhen
I look at you , I donâ€
™ t see happiness , â€ � the more utterly bleak it becomes .
Commenters !
We asked for you to hazard a guess on which are the â€œfive critical issuesâ€ � that Bernie Sanders will differentiate himself from Hillary Clinton on at todayâ€ ™ s 3:30 press conference in Boston .
So far and FirasA and WarlockScottâ€ ™ s comments seem the most likely :
Although , shout out to kattw for at least making us laugh .
A special congratulations post will be awarded to whichever commenter manages to nail Sanderâ€ ™ s top issues before 3:30pm , so please keep offering up your suggestions .
A Carson supporter asks the candidate if heâ€ ™ d consider taking another position in government if he doesnâ€ ™ t win the Republican nomination â€ “ which , considering his poll numbers , is a reasonable question .
Carson didnâ€ ™ t rule out being someoneâ€ ™ s vice - president , but kept his answer vague : Iâ€ ™ m not looking for a job .
I had a very good , long and arduous career .
I would always consult with the Lord .
Remember ,
thereâ€
™ s a lot you can do outside the government , especially if youâ€ ™ ve got a platform .
I donâ€
™ t know , if there was someone who was really compatible with me .
And right now , Iâ€ ™ m not really sure who that would be .
I never close the door on anything , including being the next president .
Who won Nevadaâ€ ™ s Latino vote on Saturday night ?
Hillary Clinton won a modest but decisive victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday .
And she won the black vote by a wide margin .
Less clear is who won the stateâ€ ™ s Latino voters .
The Sanders campaign was quick to spin Saturday nightâ€ ™ s loss as a marginal success based on polling that showed he had not only made significant inroads with Latinos but also won the stateâ€ ™ s Hispanic vote .
Specifically , early entrance polls that gave Sanders an eight - point edge over Clinton among Hispanic voters .
On Sunday , a New York Times report raised questions around the arithmetic .
The report quoted a memo from Latino Decisions , a polling firm the Clinton campaign used to tally Hispanic votes , which suggested that the math â€œdidnâ€ ™ t add upâ€ � .
A precinct - by - precinct analysis by the Timesâ€ ™ data guru , Nate Cohn , suggested that Clinton may have won the Latino vote but not by the considerable margin she won in 2008 : â€œThe actual election returns in Las Vegasâ€ ™ s Clark County hint at a different story .
Analyzed neighborhood by neighborhood , they suggest that Mrs. Clinton might have won the Hispanic vote by a comfortable margin .
She won about 60 percent of delegates in heavily Hispanic areas , a result that calls the finding of the polling into question.â€ �
Why does it matter ?
Minority voters just may determine the Democratic party nominee , especially as the contests move to states with a more diverse electorate .
Will we ever get to the bottom of this ?
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ Carsonâ€ ™ s
quiet and more laid - back demeanor and slow manner of speaking regularly gets slammed , with Donald Trump labelling him with his favorite insult :
â€œlow energyâ€ � .
But Carson shrugged off that criticism during a Virginia City town hall meeting : â€œThe ability to be calm , relaxed and controlled is a sign of strength , not a sign of weakness .
Carson then outlined what he would do if he was trying to â€œdestroy Americaâ€ � , such as raising taxes , failing to look after veterans , failing to fix electric infrastructure and putting more people on welfare â€ “ noting that any similarity to what the current president is doing is purely â€œcoincidentalâ€ � , to many laughs .
Carson is now speaking about growing up poor and how education and belief in God helped turn his life around and gave him hope : It matters what you do with the gifts that God has given you and how much energy you put into it .
The thing that bothered me most was poverty .
I hated being poor .
But once I understood that [ it was OK ] ... because I knew it was only temporary .
I could change it .

GOP presidential wannabe and Ohio governor John Kasich frustrated female supporters by declaring this morning that heâ€ ™ d gotten elected to the Ohio senate in 1978 because of â€œmany women who left their kitchensâ€ � to support him .
John Kasich : â€œHow did I get elected ?
Nobody was ...
I didnâ€ ™ t have anybody for me .
We just got an army of people ...
many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and put yard signs out for me.â€ �
Female supporter : â€œYour comment
earlier about the women came out of the kitchen to support you ?
Iâ€ ™ ll come to support you but I wonâ€ ™ t be coming out of the kitchen.â€ � Kasich , who is trying to position himself as a Republican moderate , made the comment in Fairfax , Virginia .

Marco Rubio is displaying an interest in local issues ahead of tomorrowâ€ ™ s Republican caucus in Nevada , revealing his views on prostitution .
â€œIâ€ ™ m anti - prostitution ... I wish Nevada would make it illegal .
But thatâ€ ™ s their decision to make .
I donâ€

Prostitution is legal in Nevada â€ “ and there are 19 licensed brothels â€ “ but millions of dollars of illegal prostitution , more than the legal sex work , occurs in the state every year .
But since Rubio believes in small government , he wouldnâ€ ™ t bring in laws to make it a federal offense .
â€œI think you can be against something and still say :
â€˜But I donâ€ ™ t want the federal government involved in federalizing something , â€ ™ â€ � said Rubio .
New Hampshireâ€ ™ s secretary of state confirmed the delegate count for the Republican convention from the statesâ€ ™ s primary on 9 February , with Donald Trump picking up 11 delegates and John Kasich getting four .

As much as this election might seem uniquely American â€ “ from its Clinton - Bush tussle to the billionaire reality TV star Republican frontrunner â€ “ the AP notes that politics are similar to those seen in recent years in Europe : Donald Trump â€ “ his bombast distinctly American â€ “ sometimes takes a nationalist stance that sounds a lot like the â€˜blame the immigrantâ€ ™ approach used by a growing cadre of European politicians as the continent deals with unprecedented waves of immigration and Islamic extremism .
On the left , Bernie Sanders espouses Scandinavian - style â€˜democratic socialismâ€ ™ that sounds radical to some American ears .

This just in from reporter Lauren Gambino , clarifying that our earlier update that Clinton had the day off was a miscommunication ...
Hillary Clinton has no public events today , but alas , no rest for the weary .
Not when thereâ€ ™ s cash to be collected and important hands to shake .
The former secretary of state is in southern California today , where sheâ€ ™ s scheduled to hold fundraisers in Studio City and Hancock Park .
The fundraisers are part of a two - day swing in the state .
Her trip in the state began in northern California on Sunday where she was due to attend three fundraising events .

Hustling , in this case , means speaking about when Kasich was head of the House budget committee .
â€œJohn was able to bring that Republican caucus together for a vote that brought a balanced budget , â€ � Davis says .
â€œWe got the Republicans to agree to a balanced budget .
We got the Senate on board .
We got John Kasich leading and negioating with President Clinton â€
¦ we got it passed , we got it into law .
â€œTogether , Republicans and Democrats made some of the tough choices

that led us to four straight years of balanced budgets , running surpluses , something we havenâ€ ™ t seen since.â€

Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House , following a weekend that saw Jeb Bush hang up his glasses after losing to Trump in South Carolina , and Hillary Clinton locking down the black vote and claiming Nevada in a decisive 52 - 47 win over Bernie Sanders .
Now itâ€ ™ s time for the old state switcheroo , with tomorrowâ€ ™ s Nevada Republican caucus and a Democratic primary in South Carolina on Saturday .
In Nevada , polling data from Real Clear Politics shows Donald Trump with 42 % support , Ted Cruz at 20 % and Marco Rubio at 19 % .
It echoes the result in South Carolina , where Trump sewed up the lead and Cruz and Rubio basically tied for second .
The battle for second place behind Trump is getting dirty , with Cruzâ€ ™ s spokesman Rick Tyler forced to backtrack overnight after pushing a story that said Rubio criticized the Bible .
In a video with pretty crappy audio , Rubio walks past a Cruz staffer and compliments him for reading a book ( surprise , itâ€ ™ s the Bible ) but then says , according to the subtitles of the YouTube clip : â€œNot many answers in it .
Especially in that one.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s team declared the story totally bananas , saying their candidate said the holy book had â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
Tyler apologized in a Facebook statement :
Iâ€ ™ ve deleted the post because I would not knowingly post a false story .
But the fact remains that I did post it when I should have checked its accuracy first .
I regret the mistake .
Can Sanders get the delegates required ?
Not only did Clinton win Nevada , but sheâ€ ™ s beating Sanders in the delegate race , with 502 to his 70 so far .
Plus , of those delegates , Clintonâ€ ™ s got 451 superdelegates ( party leaders who can vote regardless of their stateâ€ ™ s allegiance ) compared to Sandersâ€ ™ 19 .
There are 2,383 delegates needed to decide the Democratic nomination .
Nearly that many will be allocated in March alone , and many of the upcoming primaries favor Clinton .
â€œThe odds of his overtaking her growing increasingly remote , â€ � says a New York Times report today .
But Jeff Weavers , Sandersâ€ ™ campaign manager , reckons the Vermont Senator will be OK post 1 March , telling AP :
Itâ€ ™ s frontloaded for her , but we have the ability to stay in the long game .
Will Ben Carson drop out after Nevada ?
The retired neurosurgeon is busy claiming his campaign isnâ€ ™ t beyond resuscitation , after a Daily Beast reporter tweeted that he will bow out on Wednesday .
â€œRight now , it is way too early in the game to give up .
If you were supposed to select a nominee after just three contests , then why did w go through all of this?â€ � said Carson on Sunday .
Plus , with Bush out of race , where will his supporters â€ “ and money â€ “ go ?
Today weâ€ ™ ve got Lauren Gambino in Charleston , South Carolina , Sabrina Siddiqui hanging in Vegas with Rubio , Nicky Woolf in Reno and Paul Lewis and Sam Levin also hanging in Nevada .
Bill Clinton will be stumping for Hillary in Laredo and Dallas , Texas , ahead of the stateâ€ ™ s 1 March primary .
Are you ready for today ?
Son - of - Donald , Eric Trump , sure is ."
2016-02-22,"Ted Cruz fired a top aide on Monday after he promoted a false story questioning Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s commitment to the Bible , a move the Texas senator described as â€œa grave errorâ€ � .
Cruz sacked Rick Tyler , his national spokesman , after he circulated a video on Sunday that allegedly showed Rubio walking by a Cruz staffer in a hotel lobby who was holding a Bible .
Although the audio was fuzzy , some assumed Rubio to have remarked : â€œGot a good book there , not many answers in it.â€
�
In fact , Rubio had said â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
â€œThis morning I asked for Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s resignation , â€ �
Cruz told reporters in Las Vegas over his promotion of a news story that falsely claimed his rival said â€œsomething negative about the Bibleâ€ � .
â€œThis was a grave error of judgment , â€ � he said .
â€œIt turned out the news story he sent around was false .
But Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , even if it was true , we are not a campaign that will question the faith of another candidate.â€
�
The conservative blog that posted the video of Rubio was later updated to correct the error , and Tyler posted an apology on his personal Facebook page late on Sunday that said he regretted the mistake .
â€œI assumed wrongly that the story was correct , â€ � Tyler said .
The controversy comes on the eve of crucial caucuses in Nevada , the fourth state to hold a Republican presidential nomination contest .
It also comes on the same day that GOP insiders , including former Senate majority leader and 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole , are flocking to back Rubio .
Other endorsements Rubio received in the past 48 hours have been from several senators , including Orrin Hatch of Utah , Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas , a half dozen House members , and other party figures like former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty .
Cruz and Rubio effectively tied in South Carolinaâ€ ™ s primary at the weekend and are both vying for the mantle of challenger - in - chief to Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump .
The billionaire , who many are tipping to win in Nevada , immediately seized on the controversy in a tweet .
â€œWow , Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director .
More dirty tricks!â€ � he said .
While claiming to have zero tolerance for dirty tricks , Cruz , who is predicating his campaign on support from Christian evangelical voters , also insisted the he had been the victim of below - the - belt assaults from rivals who he said â€œattack us personally , impugn my integrityâ€ � .
â€œNone of us have heard me throw the kind of insults at Marco Rubio that he throws at me every single day .
If other candidates choose to go into the gutter , we will not do the same , â€ �
he said .
He added of his rivalâ€ ™ s campaign : â€œThey have a long record theyâ€ ™ ve earned in South Carolina of engaging in this kind of trickery and impugning the integrity of whoever their opponent is to distract the attention .
We are going to stay focused on issues and substance and record.â€ �
In reality , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has been repeatedly hit by rivals for allegedly engaging in dirty tricks , and both Trump and Rubio have openly called the Texas senator â€œa liarâ€
� .
In particular , Cruz faced criticism in Iowa for sending out a controversial â€œvoter violationâ€ � mailer .
Later , supporters of the conservative from Texas also spread the word in the minutes before the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson might be dropping out of the race after the retired neurosurgeon announced he was going home to Florida for several days and not on to New Hampshire .
Cruz later apologized for the mistake .
Tyler , a longtime aide to former House speaker Newt Gingrich , has been a fiery surrogate for Cruz and played a key role in pushing out the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s message throughout the course of the campaign .
Rubio told reporters Monday that while he accepted Tylerâ€ ™ s apology , it simply wasnâ€ ™ t enough .
â€œThis is a pattern now .
I think we are at a point where we start asking about accountability , â€ � Rubio said before boarding a flight to Elko , a small town in the north of the state .
â€œThis campaign now has repeatedly done things that they have to apologize for and no one is ever held accountable , â€ � he added .
In addition to the video , Rubio cited the rumors spread by Cruz staffers on the night of the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race .
The Florida senator similarly criticized Cruzâ€ ™ s tactics leading up to the South Carolina primary , accusing his opponent of being behind misleading push polls and robo - calls .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a very disturbing pattern of deceptive campaigns and flat - out just lying to voters , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubio spokesman Alex Conant reacted to the news by saying Tyler is â€œa really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get electedâ€ � .
â€œThere is a culture in the Cruz campaign , from top to bottom , that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty , â€ � Conant said .
â€œRick did the right thing by apologizing to Marco .
Itâ€ ™ s high time for Ted Cruz to do the right thing and stop the lies.â€
�
The Tyler firing suggests Cruz may believe his campaign is vulnerable to the emerging narrative that he is a candidate willing to play dirty â€ “ a troublesome accusation for a candidate seeking to appeal to the religious right ."
2016-02-22,"Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio arrived in Nevada late on Sunday with distinctly different pitches for why each should be considered the most viable challenger to the Republican presidential frontrunner , Donald Trump .
The two first - term senators effectively tied in South Carolinaâ€ ™ s primary at the weekend and are running short of time to stop Trump , who beat them both by a 10-point margin , from clinching the Republican nomination for the White House .
Both senators vowed that they were uniquely positioned to defeat the real estate mogul , but whereas Cruz focused his efforts on firing up Nevadaâ€ ™ s rural , religious right , Rubio underscored the need for a more diverse coalition of conservatives reflective of a new generation .
Rubio , who spent part of his childhood in Nevada , a state in which close to half the population are minorities , talked about the support he received from South Carolinaâ€ ™ s governor , Nikki Haley , and Senator Tim Scott .
â€œI was on stage receiving the endorsement of an Indian American governor from South Carolina , who was endorsing a Cuban American senator from Florida , and I was standing next to the African American Republican senator from South Carolina.â€ �
â€œThis is the face of the new conservative movement , â€ �
he told a couple of hundred supporters inside Texas Casino , a resort off the Las Vegas strip .
â€œWe are the party of everyone.â€ � Cruz , a senator for Texas , headed straight to hammer - shaped Nye County , which is over 90 % white .
In Pahrump â€ “ with 37,000 or so residents , the regionâ€ ™ s population center â€ “ he made a play for the stateâ€ ™ s rural conservatives by promising that if was sworn in as president â€œthe persecution of religious liberty ends todayâ€ � .
On a weekend that saw yet another mass shooting , Cruz also pledged to defend the second amendment while boasting of his support from the Gun Owners of America .
He further warned , in a state with a sizable Latino population , of the need â€œto finally , finally , finally control the borders and end sanctuary citiesâ€ � .
In South Carolina on Saturday , Rubio inched just ahead of Cruz to clinch second place by less than a percentage point .
Both candidates nonetheless paled in comparison with Trump , who scored a second consecutive overwhelming victory after the New Hampshire primary on 9 February .
Trump holds a similarly commanding lead in Nevada , with the caucuses less than two days away , although surveying in the state is notoriously unreliable .
Trumpâ€
™ s success has left neither Rubio nor Cruz where they had hoped to be at this stage of the race .
Rubio , despite bouncing back somewhat from a poor showing in New Hampshire , has yet to win a primary .
And Cruz , despite coming out on top of the Iowa caucuses , now faces questions over whether his evangelicals are as loyal to his campaign as had been expected .
However , the maverick senator questions the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s support base .
â€œDonald
Trump has demonstrated that he has a relatively high floor of support , â€ �
Cruz said during a brief news conference in the back room of a smoky sports bar on State Route 160 .
â€œBut heâ€ ™ s also got , I think , a ceiling.â€ �
â€œFor folks who are concerned that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go head - to - head with Hillary Clinton , it is becoming clearer and clearer that we are the one campaign that can beat Donald Trump .
Indeed , weâ€ ™ re the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump , in Iowa .
And we will continue to go forward and beat him.â€ �
While he was consistently respectful of his billionaire rival , Cruz dismissed Rubio as an underachiever who had low - balled his prospects throughout the race .
Cruz cited in particular an interview of Rubioâ€ ™ s with ABCâ€ ™ s This Week on Sunday , in which host George Stephanopoulos asked the Florida senator which state he thought he could win after losing all three early contests .
â€œHe said , â€˜I think we could win Florida , March 15,â€ ™ â€ �
Cruz recounted .
â€œNow thatâ€ ™ s a fairly amazing admission that they donâ€
™ t believe theyâ€ ™ re gon na win here in Nevada .
Apparently they donâ€ ™ t believe theyâ€ ™ re going to win any states on Super Tuesday.â€ � â€œTheyâ€ ™ re writing off March 5 .
Theyâ€ ™ re writing off March 8 .
And theyâ€ ™ re trying to wait , apparently , until March 15 to finally win a state , â€ � Cruz added .
â€œAnd I would point out even in Florida , his home state ,
heâ€ ™ s right now polling in third place , behind both Donald and me.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign sought to drive home the opposite message : that it was Cruz who had been left bruised after falling short in a state tailor - made for his evangelical appeal .
â€œIf Ted Cruz can do no better than third place in a state like South Carolina where 73 % of the electorate described themselves as â€˜born - again or evangelical Christianâ€ ™ , where else can he win?â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Terry Sullivan , wrote in a memo on Sunday .
Rubio , for his part , charted a path to victory contingent upon winnowing the field and consolidating support behind his candidacy .
With former Florida governor Jeb Bush suspending his campaign after South Carolina , Rubio said during an interview with CNN on Sunday , the dynamic was â€œbeginning to shiftâ€ � .
â€œThat is what gives us an opportunity to coalesce and bring together Republicans who understand that we have to nominate someone who will unify our party , who will reach out to people that havenâ€ ™ t voted for us and grow our party and ultimately who can win.â€ �
The Florida senator struck upon similar themes while rallying with supporters across three states on Sunday â€ “ with stops in Nashville , Tennessee , Little Rock , Arkansas , and finally Las Vegas .
Framing himself as the most viable general election candidate , Rubio spoke defiantly of his ability to challenge Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .
â€œIf you nominate me , we will win this election , â€ �
he said .
This article was amended on 22 February 2016 to correct a statement that Marco Rubio was born in Nevada .
He was born in Florida , but spent some of his childhood in Nevada ."
2016-02-22,"Ted Cruz fired top aide Rick Tyler after he promoted a false story questioning Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s commitment to the Bible , a move the Texas senator described as â€˜a grave errorâ€ ™ The departure from the race of Jeb Bush after the former governor imploded in South Carolina unstoppered a flow of endorsements for the Florida senator .
The endorsements included a couple senators , a handful of US representatives , a former Minnesota governor and Bob Dole , the 1996 Republican presidential nominee .
Reports that Mitt Romney , the 2012 nominee , was on the verge of backing Rubio were shot down , however , by Romney insiders , who said that cake wasnâ€ ™ t quite yet baked .
Donald Trump , whose most high - profile endorsement on Monday came from the star of a motorcycle reality show , stumped in Nevada after beating Rubio by 10 in South Carolina .
Do endorsements from elected officials matter ?
Or will Trump end that notion ?
Next up , Nevada Republicans caucus on Tuesday .
The smart money is on Trump to win â€ “ again .
On the Democratic side , meanwhile , Hillary Clinton has opened up a large delegate lead on rival Bernie Sanders , despite winning only two of three state contests so far .
What kind of math is that ?
In a word , superdelegates !
â€ “ party insiders who get to help pick the nominee without any duty to listen to voters .
Neat .
Even if Sanders wins popular vote , Clinton could still get nomination Kasich was talking about 1978 , and his campaign said â€˜kitchenâ€ ™ was shorthand for â€˜grassrootsâ€ ™ .
But at least one candidate for president didnâ€ ™ t give him a pass ..."
2016-02-23,"Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign backers are aligning the Republican presidential candidate with political cause of Nevadaâ€ ™ s infamous and recently - jailed rancher
Cliven Bundy , harnessing the same anti - government fervor that fueled an armed standoff in neighboring Oregon .
Ahead of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s Republican caucuses in Nevada
, Cruz has released a new ad promising to fight back against federal control of public lands
â€ “ a move that addresses the central grievance of Cliven and his sons , Ammon and Ryan Bundy , who led the armed takeover of a national wildlife refuge in Oregon last month .
Although the Texas senator hasnâ€ ™ t publicly supported the Bundy militia , Cruz has emerged as the candidate most closely tied to their ultra - conservative protests against federal land - use restrictions .
Some of the Cruz campaignâ€ ™ s Nevada representatives are painting the candidate as a champion of anti - government activism in the west â€ “ even as the Bundy brothers leading that movement face accusations in court of violently conspiring against federal officials and threatening and assaulting law enforcement agents .
The most direct link between Cruz and the Bundys is Nevada assemblywoman Michele Fiore , who is a member of Cruzâ€ ™ s leadership team in the key swing state and the most outspoken elected official defending the armed militia in Oregon .
â€œTed Cruz is the only candidate talking about giving lands back to the state where they belong , â€ � said Fiore , who earned national attention this month when she traveled to the Oregon standoff and helped negotiate a resolution .
â€œThis is a very , very , very important issue to him.â€ �
Nevadaâ€ ™ s
â€œfirst in the westâ€ � Republican caucuses come two weeks after the occupation in Oregon unraveled and federal authorities arrested Cliven Bundy , father of Ammon and Ryan .
Their father , Cliven , is the Nevada rancher whose 2014 standoff with the government over his refusal to pay grazing fees energized rightwing land - use protesters across the region .
His ranch is in the town of Bunkerville , Nevada .
Fiore has been one of his biggest defenders .
Sitting in a jail cell in Portland hundreds of miles away from the frenzy of campaigns that landed in Nevada this week , Ammon Bundy said he is hoping the presidential candidates respond to his message .
â€œI have heard several candidates talk about the constitution and its importance , â€ � the 40-year - old said in a recent phone call from jail that his lawyer recorded for the Guardian .
â€œI would like to hear them be very simple in understanding that the land belongs to the people â€ ¦ and that the constitution does not allow the federal government to own or control land inside the state.â€ �
Ammon Bundy has so far decided against endorsing any candidate , but he said he wanted a president who will acknowledge that â€œthe federal governmentâ€ ™ s overreach has caused destruction in this nationâ€ � .
Cruz , who beat Republican frontrunner Donald Trump in Iowa , which held the first - in - the - nation caucus , has since only managed to register third - place finishes in New Hampshire and South Carolina .
His supporters hope that his anti - government stances make him well - positioned in Nevada , a state with strong libertarian tendencies .
The Cruz ad , which splices images of the senator with photographs of ranchers in the desert , appears to chime with the Bundy familyâ€ ™ s belief that the US Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) restrictions have hurt ranchers and local economies â€œEighty - five percent of Nevada is owned and regulated by the federal government , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œYou , the people of Nevada , not Washington bureaucrats , should be in charge of your own land .
If you trust me with your vote , I will fight day and night to return full control of Nevadaâ€ ™ s lands to its rightful owners.â€ �
Fiore â€ “ who described the Bundys and other arrested Oregon occupiers as nonviolent
â€œcowboysâ€ � and â€œpolitical prisonersâ€ �
â€ “ argued that Cruz is the only true conservative candidate who will take the kind of aggressive action on land - use policy that Ammon Bundy is seeking .
â€œThe BLM has been nothing more than a bureaucracy of terrorism , â€ � she added .
In Carson City , Nevadaâ€ ™ s capital , itâ€ ™ s not hard to find legislators who are active Cruz campaigners and have also , to varying degrees , endorsed the actions of the Bundys .
â€œI know
Cliven , Ammon and Ryan .
To me , this is a purely political prosecution , â€ � said Nevada assemblyman John Moore , a Republican who is also on Cruzâ€ ™ s Nevada leadership team .
â€œThe federal government â€ ¦ has an agenda , and theyâ€ ™ re using the Bundys as another way to get more land.â€
� Moore said he hasnâ€ ™ t spoken to Cruz about the Bundys , but added : â€œI would venture to say Cruz is sympathetic to the underlying causes.â€ � Assemblyman Ira Hansen , another Cruz supporter in Nevada , said the lands issue could help him win the state by capitalizing on the same anger that catalyzed the Bundy ranch fight in 2014 and the recent Oregon occupation .
â€œHere in Nevada , itâ€ ™ s the anti - establishment on steroids , â€ � said Hansen .
â€œ[Cruz ] is very supportive of the idea that the federal government needs to back out â€ ¦
and he is going to do extremely well in rural Nevada.â€
� While his surrogates have described the Bundys as heroes and victims of government oppression , Cruz has only once addressed the Oregon militia with a short comment siding with law enforcement .
He told reporters : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have a constitutional right to use force of violence.â€ � Cruz spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment on the candidateâ€ ™ s stance on the Bundys , but made Nevada assemblyman Jim Wheeler available to speak on behalf of the campaign .
â€œTed Cruz is a law and order guy , â€ �
Wheeler said when asked whether the candidate supports the Bundysâ€ ™ protests .
â€œYou follow the law .
If you donâ€ ™ t like the law , you have the power to change it.â€ � Wheeler acknowledged , however , that the Bundy protests had pushed the issue forward .
â€œThe one thing Oregon and Bunkerville did is bring it to the front and get the conversation started.â€ � Cruz , in his new ad , also used his stance on land - use rights to attack Trump , who recently said : â€œI donâ€ ™ t like the idea [ of local control of federal land ] because I want to keep the lands great , and you donâ€ ™ t know what the state is going to do.â€ � Nevada senator Pete Goicoechea , a Republican who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race , said the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s stance could hurt him .
â€œThe statements that Donald Trump made â€ ¦ that heâ€ ™ d never agree to any public land transfer , good luck caucusing in Nevada.â€ �
Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign did not respond to a request for comment , and a Rubio spokesman referred to an earlier statement from the Florida senator in which he condemned the occupation , but agreed that there is too much federal control of land .
The issue of land control appears to be seeping into national policy discussions and the presidential race in an unprecedented way , said Matt Lee - Ashley , a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress , a left - leaning thinktank that has documented the candidatesâ€ ™ positions on the subject .
â€œThis is the first time that we potentially have this debate over whether public lands should be maintained in the current management by Americans , owned by taxpayers , or fundamentally transferred to states or auctioned off , â€ � he said .
Clivenâ€ ™ s wife , Carol Bundy , said she and her husband have not yet decided which candidate to support .
After hearing Cruzâ€ ™ s recent statement , she said : â€œI wasnâ€ ™ t convinced too much .
What he said is good â€
¦
but I want a little more .
I want to know how he is going to do it.â€
�
She said she was not confident any candidate would make a serious effort to get the federal government out of Nevada .
â€œNobody wants to take a stand on this , and I think thatâ€ ™ s sad , â€ �
she said ."
2016-02-23,"Donald Trump exuded the confidence of an emboldened Republican presidential frontrunner who has little to fear , using a rally on the eve of the Nevada caucuses to call his rival Ted Cruz â€œsickâ€ � and reacting to a heckler by saying : â€œIâ€ ™ d like to punch him in the face.â€ �
It was an extraordinary performance , even by Trumpâ€ ™ s standards , alarming to those who fear the rise of a demagogue , but speaking to the apparent strength of the billionaireâ€ ™ s lead in Nevada and elsewhere .
Trump enjoys a double - digit lead in Nevada , which hosts the fourth state contest in the Republican race for the White House on Tuesday .
The businessman won the last two states , New Hampshire and South Carolina , although Tuesdayâ€ ™ s caucus - style voting procedure could prove better suited to his two main rivals .
Cruz and Marco Rubio , two senators locked in a fight for the mantle of Trumpâ€ ™ s chief challenger , spent the day trading punches as they crisscrossed Nevada for a final 24 hours of increasingly bitter campaigning .
It was undoubtedly a better day for Rubio , who received a cascade of endorsements from senior Republicans after ex - Florida governor Jeb Bush pulled out of the race at the weekend .
They included the 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole and a slew of senior lawmakers .
Cruz , on the other hand , was forced to sack his national spokesman , Rick Tyler , after he circulated a video on Sunday that allegedly showed Rubio mocking the Bible as he walked past a Cruz staffer in a hotel lobby .
The row over the video , which a conservative blog wrongly said showed Rubio saying the Bible had â€œnot many answers in itâ€ � ( he had in fact said it had â€œall the answers in itâ€ � ) , marked a further deterioration in an already ugly fight between the first - term senators .
Even as Cruz told reporters he had sacked Tyler because of â€œa grave error of judgmentâ€ � , he insisted he had been the victim of below - the - belt assaults from rivals who he said â€œattack us personally , impugn my integrityâ€ � .
In reality , the Texan senatorâ€ ™ s campaign has been repeatedly accused of engaging in dirty tricks , and both Trump and Rubio are now openly calling Cruz a liar .
Both candidates repeated the allegation on Monday .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a very disturbing pattern of deceptive campaigns and flat - out just lying to voters , â€ �
Rubio told reporters , before boarding a flight to the remote town of Elko .
At his rally in Las Vegas , Trump said of the Texan senator : â€œThis guy Cruz has lied more than any human being .
He holds up the Bible , and he lies.â€ �
Trump went on to complain about a â€œphonyâ€ � Cruz ad airing in Nevada that accuses Trump of wanting to leave the stateâ€ ™ s federal lands in the hands of the government .
â€œThis guy is sick ,
thereâ€
™ s
something wrong with this guy , â€ �
Trump said .
When one of two hecklers interrupted the businessman , the property magnate openly talked of violence .
â€œYou know what they used to do with guys like that when they were in a place like this ?
Theyâ€ ™ d be carried out on a stretcher , folks , â€ � he said .
Noting the protester was smiling as he was escorted out , Trump quipped : â€œIâ€ ™ d like to punch him in the face , I tell you that.â€ �
It was a remarkable comment from a presidential candidate who appears to be building a momentum that could soon be unstoppable .
In his recent wins , Trump has exhibited the breadth of support that provides him with a clear path to the nomination , even if his high poll rating in Nevada masks what some anticipate will be an underlying weakness in the state .
Nevada is like Iowa in that it apportions its delegates through a caucus rather than a straight primary vote .
Trumpâ€ ™ s defeat in Iowa was largely put down to inferior campaign organisation and the lack of political experience among his supporters .
Caucuses are complicated contests that can be inaccessible to first - time voters , and both Cruz and Rubio have built superior ground games in the state .
In 2012 , only around 8 % of the stateâ€ ™ s eligible GOP caucus - goers participated in the contest â€ “ and on turnout that low a surprise is possible .
The other two candidates remaining in the GOP field â€ “ Ohio governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson â€ “ are trailing badly and not expected to perform well in Nevada .
However , Cruz proved in Iowa that he can excite a dedicated army of deeply Christian voters .
However , his performance in South Carolina , where he was effectively tied with Rubio , cast doubt over that strategy after exit polls indicated he won fewer evangelical voters than Trump .
Rubio , on paper at least , should be an especially well - suited candidate for Nevada .
He spent part of his childhood in Las Vegas , where his father worked behind a bar and his mother was a hotel maid .
He was also baptized as a Mormon , a key voting demographic in the state which his campaign has been courting relentlessly .
Born to Cuban parents , Rubio is competing in a state where a third of the population is Latino â€ “ although only a tiny fraction will take part in a GOP caucus .
While Cruz has pursued the stateâ€ ™ s rural , religious vote , Rubio has claimed he can diversify the partyâ€ ™ s electorate , with some justification .
Janelle LaFleur , a hotel housekeeping manager in Reno , was already a fan of Rubio before seeing him speak at the sprawling Tuscan villa - style Peppermill casino resort and spa on Monday .
But she said that had reinforced her support for the senator and she would caucus for him on Tuesday .
â€œBeing a housekeeping manager , I work with people like his mother , â€ �
she said .
However , the Florida senator is not remaining in Nevada for the results â€ “ forgoing the chance for a victory party in what many assume is a sign his campaign team is not hopeful .
Even a defeat in Nevada may not significantly dent the momentum Trump appears to have built .
He looks poised for success on Super Tuesday on 1 March in which 11 states host contests .
Some pundits are anticipating he could win every state bar Texas , Cruzâ€ ™ s home turf .
In Massachusetts , one of the Super Tuesday states , Trump leads by an incredible 50 percentage points , according to a recent poll that put his nearest rival , Rubio , on 16 % .
Trump is undoubtedly running to win Nevada , too , touring the state on a demanding schedule to get out his base .
He used his rally at the South Point casino arena in Las Vegas to repeatedly implore spectators to turn out at caucus sites on Tuesday evening .
â€œWhat the hell is a caucus ?
No one even know what it means ,
â€ �
Trump told his audience .
â€œForget the word caucus , just go out and vote
, OK?â€ �
He added : â€œI donâ€ ™ t want to turn on the television and see Donald Trump has the biggest crowds but his people are too damn lazy.â€ �
Trump rallies have become notorious , but this one nonetheless stood out for the passion of the audience and the swagger of the man on stage .
There is something quintessentially Trumpian about Las Vegas , a city of winners and losers in which the businessmanâ€ ™ s named is emblazoned across one of the tallest towers , and on Tuesday he appeared in his element .
The crowd was frenzied even before his arrival , with chants of â€œUSAâ€ � and spontaneous ripples of hand waves through the arena .
Shortly before he appeared , the room went dark , and the arena was lit up with cellphone lights .
Trump entered the auditorium on a long walkway that cut through the adoring crowd .
â€œSo many American politicians lie to get a vote , â€ � said Steven Boz , a rock musician with long , blonde hair , who relocated to Las Vegas from Los Angeles after his acting career
didnâ€
™ t work out .
He was approving of the sentiment of the presidential candidate , but like many Trump supporters , and the businessman himself , was vague on detail .
â€œTrump has a backbone , no political correctness or any of that shit .
Itâ€ ™ s real .
You canâ€
™ t have anyone come into the country and kill everyone , and all that crap .
Build a fucking wall and keep them out and put more money in America , â€ � he said .

2016-02-24,"After beating the combined performance of rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz in Nevada , Trump predicted a larger victory : â€œWe might not even need two months to be honest.â€ �
Trumpâ€ ™ s wins arenâ€ ™ t mysterious if you understand why people are angry
Trump can now boast three consecutive state victories and super - strong polling in upcoming contests .
The polls might lie â€ “ but the wins donâ€ ™ t .
The Drudge Report predicted victory for Trump .
Are you are a closeted Donald Trump voter ?
Tell us why Rubio , who once upon a time was supposed to win Nevada , said the nomination is â€œnot based on how many states you win , itâ€ ™ s based on how many delegates you picked up.â€ � True !
Governor Greg Abbott endorsed the home - state senator in Cruzâ€ ™ s biggest political get yet .
A new poll showed Cruz topping Trump by 15 points in the Lone Star state , which votes March 1 .
Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders said he would back legislation requiring police to report any and all officer - involved deaths to the federal government .
â€œYes , â€ � he told the Guardian .

2016-02-25,"Once again , Donald Trump stole the show without actually appearing on the show .
During Fox Newsâ€ ™ two - hour voter summit on Wednesday night , the four Republican hopefuls working frantically to keep pace with Trump took turns pitching themselves as the best alternative to the billionaire frontrunner .
Texas senator Ted Cruz positioned himself as the best general election candidate , citing polling that showed he would beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton should she capture the Democratic nomination .
â€œDonald consistently loses to Hillary .
I consistently beat Hillary , â€ �
Cruz told Fox Newsâ€ ™ Megyn Kelly during the live interview in Houston .
â€œAnd so the question right now is how do we prevent nominating a candidate who loses the general election â€ “ or , for that matter , if Donald wins the general election , who the heck knows what heâ€ ™ d do as president?â€ � Cruz also reminded voters that he is the only candidate so far to prove he can beat Trump , having won the Iowa caucuses with the strong support of evangelical Christians .
Trump is riding high after winning easily in Nevada â€ “ his third consecutive victory in an early - state nominating contest â€ “ and strengthening his position heading into the multi - state Super Tuesday elections .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , who has yet to win a nominating contest , cast himself as a party unifier with the appeal to grow its base .
â€œI can win .
I can unify this party .
I can grow this party , and I will win this election , â€ �
Rubio told Kelly via satellite .
â€œThe Democrats desperately do not want to run against me .
Thatâ€ ™ s why they attack me more than anyone else in this race.â€ �
Cruz said he believed it was now a â€œthree - personâ€ � race between himself , Trump and Rubio .
The two senators have clashed fiercely in recent days as they try to establish themselves as Trumpâ€ ™ s strongest challengers .
Ohio governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson were pressed to defend the legitimacy of their campaigns as some Republicans have accused them of siphoning away votes from the senators .
â€œIf
I were to get out , Donald Trump would win Ohio and that would be the end of it , â€ � Kasich said , expressing confidence that he would win his home state despite a recent poll that showed Trump edging him out of first .
â€œWe intend to keep going , Megyn , weâ€ ™ re not stopping and Iâ€ ™ m not giving up , â€ � Kasich reiterated .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s just the end of it.â€ �
Carson took a different tack , arguing that he is the only candidate not beholden to political and media elites , the two least popular groups in the 2016 elections .
â€œWhy do I stay here?â€ �
he asked rhetorically .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like losing a child
â€ ¦
Itâ€ ™ s a horrendous thing .
You would do anything to keep it from happening .
â€œWell , I feel like weâ€ ™ re in the process of losing our country .
Itâ€ ™ s in critical condition right now.â€

At the start of the show , Kelly said Trump was unable to attend as he had a â€œconflicting campaign
eventâ€ � , prompting snickers from the audience .
Kelly laughed .
â€œHe does!â€ �
she exclaimed , to more laugher from the audience .
Trump had previously skipped a Fox News debate co - moderated by Kelly after he accused her of adversarial questioning in the first debate .
On Thursday , the Republican candidates , including Trump , will face off on a debate stage in Houston , just five days before Super Tuesday ."
2016-02-25,"Ted Cruz usually exudes the self - righteous certitude of a man who knows he is heading towards both victory and heaven .
He isnâ€ ™ t just running a campaign for president , but a faith - propelled Cruzade to restore Judeo - Christian values and Reaganomics to Washington .
But at a â€œvictoryâ€ � party in a mostly empty YMCA hall in Las Vegas â€ “ a city that was built on sin
â€
“ you could sense the doubt and despair creeping in .
After Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s third resounding victory , the Cruzade against the New York infidel has less than a week to prove itself before Super Tuesday .
â€œI kind of halfway expected this , â€ � said Steve Perry , a downbeat Cruz supporter from Las Vegas .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not giving up .
As people drop out , thereâ€ ™ s still hope for Ted Cruz .
If Carson drops out , and Kasich drops out , hopefully there will be a new game.â€
�
This is the game of alternate reality that is currently playing out among all the non - Trump campaigns in the aftermath of the four early voting states .
If everyone else drops out , maybe we can win .
How or when their rivals might drop out is never explained .
Based on the current polling numbers , by the time the field narrows further , Trump will have amassed an insurmountable lead in delegates heading to the Republican convention .
Insurgent campaigns sorely need a series of victories to build name recognition , financial support and credibility .
At this point , time and momentum are not on the side of the anti - Trump forces .
Instead , they seem determined to waste their time trying to destroy one another .
Cruz has notched up just one victory in four contests .
â€œThe undeniable reality that the first four states have shown is that the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump , and the only campaign that can beat Donald Trump , is this one , â€ �
Cruz said in his defeat speech on Tuesday .
While that victory in Iowa represents Trumpâ€ ™ s only defeat , there are no grounds for thinking that Cruz is building momentum with his third place finish in Nevada .
In fact , there is plenty of evidence to show that Trump is peeling off evangelical voters â€ “ the core of Cruzâ€
™ s support â€
“ after the past two contests .
Instead , Cruz and his high - profile supporters are pinning their hopes on a single state : Texas .
Cruzâ€ ™ s home state represents the largest state up for grabs on Super Tuesday , but the other states combined â€ “ where Trump is riding high â€ “ outweigh even the Lone Star state .
Even back home in Texas , Cruz is holding a slender single - digit lead in the polls that is within the margin of error .
â€œThis is a two - man race .
Itâ€ ™ s between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump , â€ � said Dan Patrick , lieutenant governor of Texas , as he tried to rally Cruz volunteers and supporters in Las Vegas on Tuesday .
â€œThe only two candidates who will win a state next Tuesday are those two men .
And on Wednesday you could have a brand new leader on top of the delegate board.â€ �
While this scenario is mathematically possible , it conveniently ignores both the polls , the number of delegates in play on Tuesday , and the inconvenient truth that the other campaigns show no signs of giving up .
To take down the frontrunner , Cruz â€ “ and his rivals in the anti - Trump cluster â€ “ must now attack Trumpâ€ ™ s character and pitch for the presidency .
This is no easy task , not least because Trump has proved immune to attacks to date .
Itâ€ ™ s also not easy because the anti - Trump forces are attacking from a position of weakness .
Take Cruzâ€ ™ s highest - profile surrogate : the rabble - rousing talkshow host and conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck .
Styling himself as a political historian , Beck tries to take down Trump by citing Alexis de Tocqueville : â€œAmerica is great because America is good.â€
�
â€œWe have politicians right now , two of them come to mind , that are playing to the lowest common denominator .
They are playing into our anger .
If someone is playing into your rage , into your anger , thatâ€ ™ s not elevating things .
Thatâ€ ™ s tearing us down , â€ �
Beck said on Tuesday night .
â€œYou can not make America great if you are not helping make
America good.â€ �
Beck went on to complain about the way Trump treated other candidates at the last TV debate .
â€œI have never seen anything like it , â€ �
he said .
â€œThatâ€
™ s not the way we treat each other .
We have basic disagreements .
We can get along with everyone .
We should get along with everyone if we have principles in common .
And those principles are the constitution of the United States of America.â€
�
This is more than a little ironic coming from Beck , who built his fame and fortune on the Tea Party rage of the early Obama years .
Anger seemed to be perfectly acceptable if it helped the GOP sweep back into power in Congress in 2010 and block the most basic functions of government .
Beck neatly embodies the Republican establishmentâ€ ™ s central problem as it tries to deal with its spectacular implosion in this election .
Having enjoyed the rage of the Tea Party for so many years , it can not now lament about how the party has changed fundamentally .
Instead of allowing the fringe to splinter into a third party , like earlier insurgencies , the GOP leadership co - opted its anger out of a sense of expediency .
Now the establishment candidates sound like pale copies of the angriest candidate in the field .
It is too late to pretend that such politics are unhelpful or out of bounds .
The result is that the Republican party will be hard to unite after a Trump nomination .
There is a sense of disgust with Trump among Cruzâ€ ™ s supporters , who believe â€ “ like their candidate â€ “ that the real estate developer is a dangerous fake .
â€œI have heard people saying if Trump is elected , they will move to Canada , â€ � said Helen LeBrett , a Cruz campaign volunteer who traveled from California to support the Nevada effort .
â€œAnd I have said that too .
It would be really hard to vote for Trump .
â€œI have watched him and how he has treated [ Fox News host ] Megyn Kelly .
He wanted to eviscerate her .
If thereâ€ ™ s anybody who is his enemy , who isnâ€ ™ t for him , his way of doing things is slash and burn .
Itâ€ ™ s like war for him .
Megyn Kelly is a brilliant woman .
He doesnâ€
™ t know what heâ€ ™ s talking about .
Heâ€ ™ s crazy .
I mean , crazy .
He would be just a pretend Republican , just as bad as Obama.â€
�
Of course , Canada need not worry about an influx of Cruz immigrants .
Many are likely to revert to a reluctant support for their partyâ€ ™ s nominee when faced with the alternative : voting for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders .
For his part , Trump clearly doesnâ€ ™ t care .
In fact , heâ€ ™ s proud of his fight with Kelly .
So proud that his rallies begin with a video that showcases his many spats with the anchors and analysts on Fox News .
Slash and burn politics may trouble his rivals , but itâ€ ™ s working very nicely for Donald Trump ."
2016-02-26,"â€œIf you kill Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate , and the trial was in the Senate , nobody could convict you , â€ �
Republican senator Lindsey Graham said in remarks skewering his partyâ€ ™ s presidential field at the Washington press club foundation dinner on Thursday night .
The Texas senator , a contender for the Republican presidential nomination , is extremely unpopular among his congressional colleagues .
The dinner is convened by news organizations with a footprint in Washington and features stabs at comedy by elected officials .
It is not to be confused with the White House correspondentsâ€ ™ association dinner , which in recent years has become celebrity - filled and at which the president typically speaks .
The Republican party has gone â€œbatshit crazyâ€ � , Graham told the crowd , referring to the presidential race .
And he noted that he himself had dropped out of this yearâ€ ™ s presidential race and promptly endorsed former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who subsequently dropped out .
Graham put on a white â€œMake America Great Againâ€ � hat and said : â€œI endorse Donald Trump and hope the Graham magic still exists!â€
�
In reference to Cruzâ€ ™ s birth in Canada and the false belief held by about 10 % of self - identified conservatives that Barack Obama was born in Africa , he added : â€œI will say that our Canadian is better than your Kenyan.â€ �
He continued : â€œI know exactly when Ted is going to drop out of the race .
March 12
â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s Canadian week in Myrtle Beach , when all of our Canadian friends get 10 % off.â€
� Myrtle Beach is a popular resort and tourist destination in South Carolina , Grahamâ€ ™ s home state , and the city is hosting a Canadian - American Days festival beginning March 12 .
Graham had some zingers for Florida senator Marco Rubio , too , whom Graham called â€œthe boy wonderâ€
� .
Rubio is 44 , a year younger than Cruz .
â€œIâ€
™ m not saying he would change his positions , but he would change his positions , â€ � Graham said , in reference perhaps to Rubioâ€ ™ s calibration on immigration reform .
â€œThe Secret Serviceâ€ ™ s
main job
if heâ€
™ s president is to keep him hydrated , â€ � Graham said , in reference for sure to the time Rubio had to sneak a drink of water during his response to a state of the union address ."
2016-02-26,"As his opponents in the Republican debate on Thursday sought to reel in his big polling lead , Donald Trump came under heavy fire .
On domestic policy , after fierce opening exchanges on immigration , one of the key issues on which senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio focused was healthcare .
Rubio went after Trump on policy specifics ; Cruz accused him of supporting socialized medicine for all .
First came a long exchange over the intricacies of plans to repeal Obamacare that descended into characteristic bickering about who repeated himself more .
Amid the bickering , however , Trump said he would throw out Obamacare but keep requirements that insurers cover pre - existing conditions .
This prompted Rubio to unfurl an effective attack line : â€œYou may not be aware of this Donald , because you donâ€ ™ t follow this stuff very closely , but hereâ€ ™ s what happened , â€ � he said â€ “ highlighting Trumpâ€
™ s
general lack of policy detail .
Rubio then said Obamacare included a bailout for insurance companies who couldnâ€ ™ t sustain the initial costs of the new law .
Cruz followed and went for the jugular , accusing Trump of advocating for socialized medicine .
Saying Trump liked the federal womenâ€ ™ s health agency Planned Parenthood , while he would investigate it and prosecute any infractions , Cruz added : â€œDonald wants to end [ Obamacare ] because he says that it doesnâ€ ™ t nearly go far enough .
â€œFor decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine
â€
¦
If youâ€ ™ re a small business owner , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s socialized healthcare will kill more jobs than Obamacare.â€ �
Cruz then asked : â€œTrue or false : you said the government should pay for everyoneâ€ ™ s healthcare.â€ �
Trump said : â€œFalseâ€ � .
Then Cruz brought up as an attack a line from a couple of debates ago , in which Trump said he would not let people â€œdie on the sidewalkâ€ � .
Trump stood by his position , saying : â€œI will not let people die on the streets if Iâ€ ™ m president.â€
�
And then , the billionaire managed a moment of humanity , which strangely â€ “ under the force of Cruzâ€
™ s cross - examination â€ “ felt like some kind of moment of grace : â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have private healthcare .
I am not going to let people die on the streets or the sidewalks of this country , if I am president .
â€œYou might be fine with it , â€ � he said to Cruz .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not fine with it.â€ �"
2016-02-26,"Marco Rubio took the fight to Donald Trump on Thursday night .
With assistance from Ted Cruz , the Florida senator unleashed an attack on Trumpâ€ ™ s business record and policy acumen that has the potential to shake up the Republican presidential race .
Trump , who has emerged as the Republican frontrunner with remarkably little vetting , was consistently attacked for employing foreign and illegal workers , for his business record and for his lack of policy specifics .
The debate , five days before the critical Super Tuesday primaries when voters in 12 states will cast their verdict on the Republican field , descended into a series of personal attacks and bad - tempered exchanges .
At times , the candidates shouted over each other .
Rubio gleefully mocked Trump , saying â€œYou say the same thing every night , â€ � and even gave his own parody of Trumpâ€ ™ s stump speech : â€œEveryoneâ€ ™ s dumb , Iâ€ ™ m going to make America great again , Iâ€ ™ m winning in the polls , lines around the states ,
every night.â€ �
It was the first time rival candidates have used a debate stage to go after the foundation of Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign â€ “ his experience as a businessman , his assertion that he is the only candidate who can be relied upon to be a stalwart opponent of illegal immigration , and his fundamental belief in â€œwinningâ€ � .
It left Trump stuttering and defensive .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t repeat myself , â€ �
he said , as he struggled through another tough exchange with Rubio .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t repeat myself .
I donâ€
™ t repeat myself.â€
�
The concerted attacks and Trumpâ€ ™ s counterpunching left John Kasich and Ben Carson as relative bystanders .
At one point , Carson pleaded : â€œCan somebody attack me?â€ �
Trump has built a populist movement of discontented blue collar voters very different from the fiscally and socially conservative coalition George W Bush once relied on .
As he said onstage : â€œWe are building a new Republican party .
A lot of new people are coming in.â€
�
But on Thursday his rivals tried to discredit him with those voters and consolidate their own appeal among Republicans who disdain Trump .
Rubio used immigration as a cudgel .
The first question , from CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer , was on Trumpâ€ ™ s plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants but to let â€œthe good onesâ€ � back in .
Rubio seized the opportunity .
â€œThe truth is , though , that a lot of these positions that heâ€ ™ s now taking are new to him , â€ �
he said .
He referred to a New York Times story on Thursday that claimed that Trumpâ€ ™ s exclusive club in Palm Beach , Florida , has pursued more than 500 temporary foreign worker visas since 2010 and hired only a handful of US residents .
â€œWe saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald , youâ€ ™ ve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œMy mom and dad â€
“
my mom was a maid at a hotel , and instead of hiring an American like her , you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.â€ �
Trump said this was because of a lack of available American workers .
â€œThey were part - time jobs , â€ � he said .
â€œYou needed them , or we just might as well close the doors , because you couldnâ€ ™ t get help in those hot , hot sections of Florida.â€ � Rubio then mentioned reports claiming that undocumented immigrants have worked at Trump properties .
In the 1980s Trump faced a lawsuit alleging that undocumented Polish demolition workers worked on Trump Tower in Manhattan .
The suit was not settled until 1999 , and the settlement never made public .
A 2015 Washington Post story suggested undocumented workers could have been involved in building a new luxury hotel in the city .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re the only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally .
You hired some workers from Poland , â€ � Rubio said , adding that Trump was forced to pay â€œa million dollars or soâ€
� in a judgment .
Trump said this was â€œtotally wrongâ€ � and hit back : â€œIâ€ ™ m the only one on the stage thatâ€ ™ s hired people .
You havenâ€ ™ t hired anybody.â€ � â€œIf he builds the [ border ] wall the way he built Trump Towers heâ€ ™ ll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve hired tens of thousands of people ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œHe brings up something from 30 years ago .
It worked out very well .
Everybody was happy.â€ �
Cruz attacked Trump as a Johnny Come Lately .
â€œI really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration ,
â€ � the senator said .
â€œI can tell you , when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas , I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty , promising to fight to build a wall .
â€œAnd in 2013 , when I was fighting against the â€˜gang of eightâ€ ™ amnesty bill , where was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ �
Rubio also repeatedly hit Trump on Trump University , a for - profit enterprise that promised to teach attendees about the real - estate world .
Trump is facing several lawsuits in federal court from unhappy customers of what Rubio said was â€œa fake universityâ€ � .
The attack was echoed by Cruz , who referenced one coming case , warning that Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œlawyers have scheduled the trial for Julyâ€ � and saying the mainstream media would make hay if â€œthe Republican nominee [ was ] in court on the stand being cross - examined about whether he has committed fraudâ€ � .
Trump claimed the allegations in the case were â€œnonsenseâ€ � and insisted that he had only refused to settle it out of principle .
Rubio jibed : â€œYou know where Donald Trump would be if he hadnâ€
™ t inherited $ 200 m ?
Selling watches in Manhattan.â€ �
Trump was also left staggering after an assault from Rubio on his healthcare plan .
In response , Trump insisted he would â€œget rid of the lines around statesâ€ � , without providing further detail , and resorted to bringing up Rubioâ€ ™ s implosion in the New Hampshire debate against Chris Christie as a defense .
â€œI watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago , â€ �
Trump insisted .
Rubio fired back : â€œI just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago.â€ �
Trump kept on trying to change the subject to New Hampshire .
Trump was then repeatedly hit on a supposed reluctance to release his tax returns , a subject that 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney â€ “ no stranger to the issue
â€ “ has brought up in recent days .
Cruz and Rubio said they would release their tax returns in the coming days , Rubio saying his were coming Friday or Saturday .
Trump said he could not release his because of an ongoing audit .
â€œEvery year they audit me ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI will absolutely file my returns , but Iâ€ ™ m being audited now for two or three years and I canâ€ ™ t do it until the audit is finished.â€ �
Afterwards , the Rubio and Cruz campaigns both declared victory .
Jason Miller , a top aide to Cruz , told the Guardian the senator â€œjammed up Donald Trumpâ€ � .
He also sarcastically praised Rubio â€œfor eating his Wheaties and getting into the mix for the first timeâ€ � .
Miller felt confident that night was a win for his man .
â€œDonald Trump didnâ€
™ t look presidential tonight and he lost a lot of votes , â€ �
he said before adding , in a reference to the immigration reform effort spearheaded by Rubio in 2013 :
â€œThose votes arenâ€ ™ t going to a member of the gang of eight.â€ � Todd Harris , a top adviser to Rubio , said the Florida senator had met all his goals : â€œThere is a growing anti - Trump movement within the party and our goal tonight was to have Marco emerge as leader of that movement
and I think we succeeded.â€
�
Miller said many of Rubioâ€ ™ s attacks were not based on substantive issues because â€œtrying to wage a battle of substance against Trump is pretty futile effortâ€ � .
â€œAnyone who goes into an attack on Donald Trump by saying heâ€ ™ s not a conservative , â€ � he said , â€œis not going to win that fight because Trump doesnâ€ ™ t pretend to be a conservative.â€
�
The debate was the last one before Super Tuesday , which will produce the largest delegate haul of the GOP candidate selection process .
Texas , with 155 delegates , is the largest of the 12 states that vote on 1 March , which range from conservative southern states such as Alabama and Georgia to liberal outposts in New England such as Vermont and Massachusetts .
Trump has led in recent polls in almost every Super Tuesday state .
The exception is Texas , Cruzâ€ ™ s home state , where the senator has a narrow lead .
Trump leads Rubio in Florida .
Todd Harris , the Rubio aide , said his candidate finally went after Trump only because Jeb Bush had dropped out .
As long as the former Florida governor was running , he said , attacks from his Super Pac â€œmade it hard for us to make case that this was two - person race between us and Donald Trumpâ€ � .
The question now is this : given that the Rubio campaign is already writing off any chance of winning a Super Tuesday state , when will that two - man race come to exist and who will run it ?
As Jason Miller , the Cruz operative , jibed about Rubioâ€ ™ s newfound aggression : â€œMarco has yet to win a state .
Thereâ€ ™ s probably more a sense of desperation and it has to be weighing on him pretty heavily.â€
�
Elsewhere in the spin room , Trump also dismissed Rubio .
â€œI thought he was ineffective , â€ � he said .
â€œI think he was a weak guy .
I thought Ted Cruz did better but
what do I know.â€
�
Rubio , he charged , was a â€œchoke
artistâ€ � .
The tone was familiar ; at times , the debate had descended into little more than a slanging match , candidates speaking angrily over each other .
â€œDonald , you can get back on your meds now , â€ �
Cruz said during one exchange .
â€œIâ€ ™ m relaxed .
Youâ€ ™ re the basket case , â€ �
Trump said .
Carson , speaking to reporters , sought to sum it all up .
â€œItâ€
™ s clear this was all about ratings and fights , â€ � he said .
â€œUnfortunately , the audience didnâ€ ™ t help because when people would fight they would yell
â€˜Yeah !
Yeah!â€ ™
like it was gladiators.â€ �"
2016-02-26,"Love him or hate him , you got ta hand it to Donald Trump : no one is better at manipulating the news cycle than he is .
And there is an almost Shakespearean quality to todayâ€ ™ s latest installment of the Trump Show .
Barely over 12 hours into his worst news cycle , after a debate where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz delivered a bruising tag - team assault on the Donald and his record , Trump managed to instantly change the conversation .
Governor Chris Christieâ€ ™ s endorsement of Trump Friday afternoon not only ends a bad news cycle for Trump , but it also sucks all the oxygen out of Rubioâ€ ™ s moment in the spotlight .
The icing on the cake for Trump is that he manages to accomplish both of these things by announcing the endorsement of his main rivalâ€ ™ s nemesis â€ “ the man responsible for single - handedly stopping Rubioâ€ ™ s post - Iowa momentum at a prior debate .
Christie is a little manâ€ ™ s
Trump : equal parts authoritarian executive and blustering machismo .
He ran his now - defunct campaign promising to â€œtell it like it isâ€ � and vowing to increase the power of the NSA and to crack down on states that legalize marijuana .
The only reason Christie never really gained traction in the primaries is because Trump offered a bigger , badder version of what Christie was peddling .
The real question , then , isnâ€ ™ t why Christie endorsed Trump .
Itâ€ ™ s , whatâ€ ™ s in it for Chris Christie ?
While I donâ€ ™ t think Christie likes Rubio , I also havenâ€ ™ t heard anything that would lead me to believe that this endorsement is driven by personal animosity towards him .
So what is in it for Christie ?
Hard to imagine him being anyoneâ€ ™ s vice president .
Is he angling to be attorney general in a Trump administration ?
Possibly .
For Trump , the significance of this endorsement canâ€ ™ t be understated , not because Christie is going to sway many voters
â€ “ he wonâ€ ™ t .
Sure , he will be a helpful surrogate and attack dog on the trail and on television .
But the endorsementâ€ ™ s true importance is that it blunts Rubioâ€ ™ s momentum and puts the spotlight back on Trump , who is winning in almost every Super Tuesday state and just needs to run out the clock .
Not only does the Christie endorsement take the spotlight off of Rubio , but it also signals that the establishment isnâ€ ™ t monolithic in its support for Rubio .
Christie was once a rising star in the Republican party , a governor elected in deep blue New Jersey , whose endorsement was much coveted during the 2012 primary .
His endorsement â€ “ coupled with Trumpâ€ ™ s first congressional endorsements this week â€ “ shows that at least certain pockets of the Republican establishment are beginning to warm up to the idea of President Donald Trump .
Rubio got 12 hours to enjoy the spotlight after Thursday nightâ€
™ s debate .
Now itâ€ ™ s back to regularly scheduled programming : the Trump Show ."

Talk about a Friday news dump , amiright ?
From New Jersey governor Chris Christieâ€ ™ s surprise endorsement of Republican billionaire frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign to former candidate Lindsey Graham joking about murdering Texas senator Ted Cruz in a bid to stop the â€œbatshitâ€ � primary from tearing apart the GOP , itâ€ ™ s been a humdinger of a Friday .
Before you drown out the sound of four adult men bickering over one another for 45 seconds straight with your drink of choice - we suggest The Trump - letâ€ ™ s go over the highlights from the campaign trail : Marco Rubio turned up on the Today show to press his argument that Donald Trump is not a logical choice to carry the mantle of American conservatism , calling the billionaire a â€œcon artist.â€ �
â€œWeâ€ ™ re on the verge of someone taking over the conservative movement in the Republican party
whoâ€ ™ s a con artist , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œHe has spent his career sticking it to working Americans.â€
�
The junior senator from Florida later backed up his â€œcon artistâ€ � insult by stating that Trump feared that he would wet his pants on the debate stage .
Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton declared that she â€œlove[s ] having men at my feet , â€ � which would have lead todayâ€ ™ s recap if the day hadnâ€ ™ t been so insane .
New Jersey governor Chris Christie gave Rubio what we call a â€œJersey handshakeâ€ � by endorsing Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential bid , jumping to the front of the queue for potential vice presidential picks should Trump win the partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
Shortly thereafter , living gaffe - machine Paul LePage , the governor of Maine , followed suit .
Not one to hog endorsements , Trump disavowed the support of noted white supremacist and one - time future governor of Louisiana David Duke .

Unless youâ€ ™ re a citizen of an early - voting state , youâ€ ™ re unlikely to have seen these advertisements in between airings of American Idol , but through the miracle of streaming video , the most important political ads are only a mouse - click away .
Democrats :

s
â€œStandâ€ �
Featuring a voiceover from God Himself
- thatâ€ ™ s Morgan Freeman , to use His mortal name - the ad , called Stand , began running in South Carolina this past weekend .
The 30-second spot focuses on Clintonâ€ ™ s criticism of police brutality , her stance on the Flint , Michigan , water crisis and her work as secretary of state under Barack Obama .
This is the second time the Oscar - winner has provided his voice for a Clinton campaign advertisement , having emphasized her willingness to â€œdo all the good you can , for all the people you can , for as long as you canâ€ � in a spot called All the Good .
Republicans :
John Kasichâ€ ™ s
â€œThe Adult
In the Roomâ€ �
Although lacking in a voiceover from a Hollywood celebrity , Kasichâ€ ™ s ad does make quick and effective use of the most embarrasing - by - proxy moment of last nightâ€ ™ s Republican presidential debate .
When the three top - tier candidates ( plus moderator Wolf Blitzer ) were caught in a high - speed verbal pileup , it highlighted some of the main concerns of moderates within the Republican party : That the aggressive primary was driving the main candidates in a race to the bottom .
This long - ish spot clocks in at a minute and twenty seconds , but effectively highlights Kasichâ€ ™ s term as governor and his ability to get things done - without calling his opponents names .
Hillary Clinton rally :
Pom Poms and Protesters edition
After a performance by the South Carolina State University cheerleaders , an appearance by the schoolsâ€ ™ s mascot and a string of introductions from civil rights luminary congressman James Clyburn and singer - reality star K. Michelle , Hillary Clinton took the stage in Orangeburg , South Carolina .
But what was meant to be a rousing pep rally before South Carolina Democrats head to the polls on Saturday was distracted by two protesters .
One man held a sign that read â€œWe came here to heal , not to be brought to heel , â€ � a reference to comments that she made in the 90s referring to young gang members as â€œsuper predatorsâ€ � .
A supporter jumped in front of the man as he held his sign .
The man was eventually escorted out of the gymnasium .
Clinton was previously interrupted at a fundraiser in Charleston by a Black Lives Matter protester who raised those questions .
Serial protester Rod Webber , known as the Flower Man because he likes to hand candidates â€œflowers for peace , â€ � also interrupted Clinton while he recorded her with his videocamera .
He told reporters , who immediately surrounded him , that Clinton is â€œnot the candidate for black peopleâ€ � .
Despite the interruptions , most people in the room continued to pay attention to Clintonâ€ ™ s speech .
Tyler Prieston , a recent graduate of the university and aspiring trainer , said he came to the rally undecided between Clinton and her rival , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , but was convinced after listening to her speak .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re fighting for the same things , â€ �
he said .
â€œBut I think sheâ€ ™ ll win in the end.â€ � Priestonâ€ ™ s major concerns this election are college affordability and education .
After four years of college , he said is more than $ 50,000 in debt and will have to begin paying it back in four months .
And it doesnâ€ ™ t help that his parents were major supporters of Bill Clinton .
â€œI guess that kind of influences me , â€ � he said .
â€œBut I think sheâ€ ™ ll be her own president.â€ �

Donald Trump isnâ€ ™ t the only candidate earning endorsements today - Vermont senator Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ campaign office was visited by Russian feminist punk rock protest group Pussy Riot this afternoon , where the group applauded the candidate and â€œwhat u stands for!â€ � Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s rhetoric about migrants and his promise to wall off the USâ€ ™ s southern border have prompted Joe Biden to apologize on behalf of a nation and driven former Mexican president Vicente Fox to swearing .
But even if the border wall is never built , many in Mexico fear that Trumpâ€ ™ s comments about the country will result in a more draconian US border policy , threatening to derail two decades of closer ties and economic integration brought about by the North American Free Trade Agreement .
â€œThere is no winning for Mexico in this situation , â€ � says Federico EstÃ © vez , political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico .
â€œThe only win is if Trump loses down the line .
But you can be sure that his policy on immigration will be followed at the border.â€
� Hours after New Jersey governor and former Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie endorsed frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign for the White House , Maineâ€ ™ s governor , Paul LePage , has thrown his support behind the real estate tycoon .
In an interview on the Howie Carr show , a Boston - area radio show , LePage endorsed Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , telling Carr , â€œYou know , we could do a lot worse .
We could have another Obama in there , or Hillary Clinton .
And we canâ€ ™ t afford that.â€
�
â€œI think the governors have got to come out and pick your poison , because Iâ€ ™ m telling you , weâ€ ™ ve got to stop the charade that went on last night , â€ � LePage said , referring to the dogpile debate in Texas that featured nearly a minute of four - way crosstalk .
He has a message to senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , who he accused of â€œkillingâ€ �
Trump : â€œYouâ€ ™ re also killing the brand.â€
�
â€œThe one thing I like about Donald Trump , Iâ€ ™ m not gon na say I agree with everything heâ€
™ s saying ...
heâ€ ™ s showing a vision for the future , â€ � LePage said .
â€œHe wants to make America great again , and heâ€ ™ s the only person doing that right now.â€ � LePage , who described himself in the interview as â€œjust a schmuck from the streets , â€ � told Carr that he had not spoken with Trump about his endorsement beforehand , although he had been considering doing so after Chris Christie dropped out of the presidential race .
LePage , like Trump , is no stranger to controversy and is well known for his incendiary rhetoric .
In January , the governor was forced to apologize for making racially charged comments about drug dealers at an event on Wednesday night .
â€œThese are guys with the name D - Money , Smoothie , Shifty â€ “ these types of guys â€ “
they come from Connecticut and New York , they come up here , they sell their heroin , they go back home , â€ � LePage said .
â€œIncidentally , half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave , which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road.â€ �
These cheerleaders help put the pep in pep rally one day before South Carolina Democrats head to the polls .
And we go another day without Clinton taking questions from the press .
A CNN reporter tried to ask her about the news of the day â€ “ Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s big endorsement â€ “ during a quick stop at a coffee shop in Atlanta , where she held a rally earlier today , but she didnâ€ ™ t bite .
â€œI really do like you ...
thatâ€ ™ s a good one , â€ � Clinton said , apparently in reference to his question .
The reporter , Dan Merica , has been tallying the number of days Clinton has gone without holding a press conference .
By his count , she hasnâ€ ™ t held a press conference since December .
Or put another way , since the new year began , since the Paris Climate Conference , since Trumpâ€ ™ s Muslim ban , since voters started voting , since Kanye released the Life of Pablo .
You get the picture .
Donald Trump has pledged to change the libel laws in a way that could undermine the first amendment and the freedom of the press , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs : Speaking at a rally in Fort Worth , Texas , on Friday , shortly after accepting an endorsement from New Jersey governor Chris Christie , Trump pledged if elected president to â€œopen up our libel laws so when [ newspapers ] write purposely negative stories
â€
¦ we can sue them and make lots of moneyâ€ � .
This move , he said , would mean that â€œwhen the New York Times or the Washington Post writes a hit piece , we can sue themâ€ � .
Since the American revolution , freedom of the press has been a key principle in American public life , with truth long established as an absolute defense to any accusation of libel .
The first amendment states that â€œCongress shall make no law â€ ¦ abridging the freedom of speech , or of the pressâ€ � .
It is a foundation stone of democracy in the United States .
Former secretary of state and Democratic presidential frontrunner
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™
s camp is running a new advertisement ahead of the Massachusetts primary on Tuesday , with former congresswoman and gun violence survivor Gabriel Giffords telling Bay State Democrats that sheâ€ ™
s voting for Clinton in a straight - to - camera address .
â€œWe have a gun violence problem , â€ � Giffords says to the camera .
â€œSo
Iâ€ ™ m voting for Hillary Clinton.â€
�
Interspliced with images of makeshift memorials following gun massacres across the United States , Giffords calls Clinton â€œtough.â€ � â€œShe will stand up to the gun lobby , â€ � Giffords says .
â€œShe will fight to make our families safer .
It matters.â€ �
The advertisement is a continuation of Giffordsâ€ ™ long - standing support of the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s candidacy .
At a speech in Ames , Iowa , in January , the former congresswoman used the same words : â€œHillary is tough.â€ � â€œIn the White House , she will stand up to the gun lobby .
Thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ m voting for Hillary.â€ � Clinton has increasingly sought to make gun control a wedge issue between her and Bernie Sanders .
The Clinton campaign has aggressively pushed the narrative that Sandersâ€ ™ record on gun safety has , on occasion , been more aligned with the agenda of the National Rifle Association .
In return , Sanders has consistently pointed to his D- rating from the NRA .
After a brief moment with Marco Rubio in the spotlight , Donald Trump stole it back with the New Jersey governorâ€ ™ s support , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Christopher Barron : Love him or hate him , you got ta hand it to Donald Trump : no one is better at manipulating the news cycle than he is .
And there is an almost Shakespearean quality to todayâ€ ™ s latest installment of the Trump Show .
Barely over 12 hours into his worst news cycle , after a debate where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz delivered a bruising tag - team assault on the Donald and his record , Trump managed to instantly change the conversation .
Governor Chris Christieâ€ ™ s endorsement of Trump Friday afternoon not only ends a bad news cycle for Trump , but it also sucks all the oxygen out of Rubioâ€ ™ s moment in the spotlight .

President Barack Obama departed from scripted remarks at a manufacturer in Florida on Friday to address a shooting spree Thursday in Kansas and last weekend in Michigan , according to a pool report .
â€œThese acts may not dominate the news today but these are two more communities in America torn apart by grief , â€ �
Obama said .
â€œI thought it was important for me to say something today because otherwise these sorts of shootings become
routine.â€ �
â€œWe can not become numb to this.â€ �
â€œThis happens far too many times and affected far too many innocent Americans.â€
�
â€œAs long as Iâ€ ™ m president Iâ€ ™ m going to keep on bringing this up ...
Lord knows I wish I didnâ€ ™ t have to make these phone calls and comfort families ....
The real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine.â€ �
For further reading : Part of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential platform ( often lost amid his controversial promises to force Mexico to build a wall along the US border and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States , let alone his suggestion that we impose a unilateral 45 % tariff on Chinese goods entering the United States to reduce the trade deficit ) is to increase the United Statesâ€ ™ trade enforcement efforts against other nations , particularly China .
Despite the economic downturn and the Democratsâ€ ™ general pro - enforcement preferences , trade enforcement did not markedly increase under the Obama Administration â€ “ a subject of some frustration among manufacturers and workers in industries forced to compete with Chinese goods .
Trade policy ( and especially free trade agreements and trade enforcement ) has always been a sore point between labor and any given administration , and the fact that Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement ( Nafta ) into law in the 90s continues to rankle liberals today .
Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ opposition to the Trans - Pacific Partnership ( wildly unpopular among liberals even before the text was released ) on the campaign trail was an early point of difference between him and Hillary Clinton before she came out against it ; sheâ€ ™ s since pointed out that , while in the Senate , she voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement ( Cafta ) .
Still , Trumpâ€ ™ s vociferous opposition to free trade at the expense of American workers and businesses was considered likely to peel off ( or convince to return to the polls ) the so - called â€œReagan Democratsâ€ � â€ “ blue collar , union voters disillusioned by their candidate and manufacturing declines â€ “ from the eventual Democratic nominee .
So , perhaps itâ€ ™ s a coincidence that the administration is trumpeting its trade enforcement measures or that Clinton is pushing a strong trade enforcement agenda as president ... but perhaps not .
On Monday , the president promised at the meeting of the National Governorâ€ ™ s Association to get tougher on unfair Chinese trade practices â€ “ though not to eliminate Chinaâ€ ™ s access to the US market for steel .
On Wednesday , the president signed into law the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act , which was intended to allow the administration to more fully investigate currency manipulation in countries like China ( something Trump has repeatedly mentioned ) and to impose retaliatory tariffs on countries like China that are found to be selling goods at below - market value in the United States in a manner compliant with Americaâ€ ™ s obligations to the WTO .
( Trumpâ€ ™ s promises to impose tariffs , by comparison , would likely not be WTO compliant and could lead to US products facing Chinese tariffs . )
Simultaneously , the president announced several executive actions to improve trade enforcement , including the hiring of more Customs and Border Protection officers to perform port inspections of steel imports and Commerce Department staff to ensure tariff enforcement .
But it might be too little , too late â€ “ and way , way too esoteric an action â€ “ for workers in the many industries that have been hurt by US trade policy over the last 25 years and like the sound of a retaliatory tariff , even if they wouldnâ€ ™ t like the inevitable result ( higher prices at American stores ) .
Trump is wrapping up .
â€œOur whole thing is make America great again , â€ � he says .
Trump has a history of hating US libel laws , which in his opinion â€œsuck.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve never said this before , â€ � says Trump .
( What else isnâ€ ™ t he telling us ? )
What follows sound as much like an assault on the first amendment as you could pretty much make up :
â€œOne of the things Iâ€
™ m gon na do if I win ... is Iâ€
™ m gon na open up our libel laws
so when [ newspapers ] write purposely negative stories ...
we can sue them and make lots of money ...
So when the New York Times or the Washington Post writes a hit piece , we can sue them .
â€œWith me theyâ€ ™ re not protected because Iâ€ ™ m not like other people ...
So weâ€ ™ re going to open up those libel laws , folks , and weâ€ ™ re gon na have people sue you like youâ€ ™
ve never been sued before.â€

â€œI said letâ€ ™ s keep it as a secret for the people in Texas.â€ � â€œWe have a lot of endorsements happening ... but the one I really was happy with was this one right here.â€

How much is Chris Christieâ€ ™ s endorsement of Donald Trump really worth ?
Trump might want to ask Mitt Romney , who thought heâ€ ™ d benefit from Christieâ€ ™ s endorsement and the governorâ€ ™ s convention speech in support of Romney in 2012 .
But a flashback to 2012 reveals that the speech wasnâ€ ™ t positive for Christie or Romney .
From Politico : Political commentary about the 24-minute speech â€ “ while some of it has been favorable â€ “ has been dominated by discussion of whether Christie offered too many words about himself and too few about Romney or about the kind of original and provocative ideas that many were expecting on such a major occasion .
The fallout on Wednesday was the talk of Tampa and left Christie on the defensive to avoid lasting damage to his political fortunes .
It also revealed tensions between the Christie and Mitt Romney camps .
Does that still hold true ?
Letâ€ ™ s look at the transcript , and note that Christie didnâ€ ™ t mention Romney by name until halfway through .
Some more numbers : Number of times Christie mentioned Romney by name : 7 Number of times Christie mentioned New Jersey by name
: 5 Number of times Christie said â€œmeâ€ � : 9 Number of times Christie said â€œIâ€ � : 37
But perhaps Christie can recycle some of his speech for 2016 :
Itâ€ ™ s a moment like this where some skeptics wonder if American greatness is over .
How those who have come before us had the spirit and tenacity to lead America to a new era of greatness in the face of challenge .
Not to look around and say â€œnot me , â€ �
but to say , â€œYes , Me.â€ �
Trump is definitely a â€œYes ,
Meâ€ � kind of guy .
Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s communications director apparently watched the Christie - Trump news conference , just wrapped : Christie is asked whether he is interested in a cabinet position or the vice presidency .
â€œI
havenâ€
™ t been offered any position and I donâ€
™ t speculate on those kinds of things , â€ � he says .
Christie says heâ€ ™ s governor through January 2018 then heâ€ ™ s going to enter the private sector and make money â€œlike
Trumpâ€ �
â€ “ more than his wife for once , is his goal .
Sheâ€
™ s an investment banker .
Trump is defending his various brands that Rubio has named in the past two days in an attempt to depict Trump as the king of a crumbling business empire .
Rubio named Trump University , Trump vodka and Trump ties made in China .
â€œI make vodka for all of my clubs , â€ �
Trump explains .
Theyâ€ ™ re some of the best clubs in the world , he says .
Heâ€ ™ s a teetotaller .
â€œMarco Rubio is a lightweight , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t have the talent , he doesnâ€ ™ t have the temperament , he will never make us great.â€ �
Trump says Rubio lied onstage on Thursday night when he , Rubio , said Trump got a $ 200 m gift from his father .
â€œIf you knew Brooklyn in the early 1980s , and the 1970s , there wasnâ€ ™ t $ 200 m , let me tell you .
And I do have brothers and sisters ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI got a very very small loan from my father many years ago .
I built that into a massive empire and I paid my father back that money .
â€œFor this guy , this lightweight ... to get up and say $ 200 m ....
wow , how does he say that ,
thatâ€ ™ s not true ...
Itâ€ ™ s really a shame.â€ �
Trump says his sister and brother called him after the debate and said â€œwow , how can he do that?â€ �
Trump is asked whether he might have considered Rubio as a vice presidential pick .
No way , Trump says .
â€œNow
itâ€ ™ s obvious that heâ€
™ s not going to be.â€
�
But he never thought Rubio was of sufficient caliber .
â€œItâ€ ™ s interesting about people who choke ...
Iâ€ ™ ve watched people who choke over the years .
Once a choker , always a choker .
The guy that misses a kick , misses a kick ,
â€ �
Trump says .
Then he again brings up Rubioâ€ ™ s New Hampshire debate performance under assault from Christie :
He didnâ€
™ t know where he was .
I thought he was going to die.â€ �
Trump says he thinks he can beat Senator Ted Cruz in Texas on 1 March .
â€œI think we have a great shot , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œPeople are liking me a lot .
I have a lot of great friends in Texas , many many friends.â€

Then Trump bashes Rubio as a â€œNervous Nellyâ€ � : â€œHe is not presidential material , that I can tell you .
Heâ€ ™ s
a Nervous Nelly .
I watch him backstage ...
Iâ€ ™ ve never seen a human being sweat like this man sweats .
I donâ€

heâ€

I donâ€

The Trump camp is circulating statements touting the Christie endorsement .
â€œIt is my great honor to receive the endorsement of the Governor , â€ �
Trump is quoted as saying .
â€œWe have had a wonderful relationship for many years .
He is a solid person that I have tremendous respect for .
I am really proud to receive the support of the Governor and his family.â€ � â€œDonald is a leader , â€ �
Christie is quoted as saying .
â€œHe is a successful person that , like me , isnâ€ ™ t afraid to tell it like it is .
Our system is broken and it wonâ€ ™ t be fixed from the inside .
I am proud to offer my endorsement of his candidacy for President.â€ �
Will this be counted as a second major act of treason of the Republican party by Chris Christie , after his embrace of Barack Obama in the Superstorm Sandy aftermath ?
â€œThis is the person who will go to DC , and will actually be able to turn the place around , â€ � Christie says .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need any more Washington politicians.â€

There was a period of time when I was running against him ... that time has passed .
As a good , loyal American , who is the best person for stopping Hillary Clinton ?
Trump is asked about David Duke , the former KKK grand wizard and Louisiana legislator who yesterday encouraged supporters to back Trump .
â€œDid he endorse me?â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI disavow it ,
OK.â€ � Christie said he met Trump yesterday morning , they sat and talked and Christie made a final decision .
Was there an offer in it for Christie ?
Christie , of course , was the candidate who delivered the one crushing blow against Rubio , on the debate stage before the New Hampshire primary , highlighting how Rubio used a template to answer questions and flustering Rubio to the extent that the Florida senator wound up repeating himself .
Rubio is perceived to be the Republicansâ€ ™ best chance at stopping the Trump nomination .
Now Trump has recruited the number - one anti - Rubio attack dog .
Christie and Trump are taking questions .
Christie dismisses the notion that senator Marco Rubio flustered Trump at the Houston debate .
â€œThe fact of the matter is , no oneâ€ ™ s gon na get inside this guyâ€ ™ s head ... there is no better fighter than Donald Trump ,
â€ � says Christie .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to fight for the American people .
And you didnâ€ ™ t hear Senator Rubio talking about that this morning .
Trump thanks Christie :
Generally speaking Iâ€ ™ m not big on endorsements ...
This was an endorsement that really meant a lot . ...
This is the one endorsement that I felt very strongly about , that I wanted to get .
Trump is asked about Rubio saying he was shaken up backstage at the Houston debate and saying that Trump had a sweat moustache .
Rubio really did say that .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll tell you about backstage , â€ �
Trump says , enthusiastically .
Heâ€ ™ s with a pile of makeup putting it on his face , and I say Marco , easy with the makeup , you donâ€ ™ t need that much ....
I saw him backstage , he was putting it on with a trowel .
Hereâ€ ™ s video of Rubioâ€ ™ s attack on Trump this morning
: Christie says the most important thing is to nominate someone who can beat Hillary Clinton , and
thatâ€ ™ s
Donald Trump :
I can guarantee you that the one person Hillary and Bill Clinton do not want to see on that stage in September is Donald Trump .
They know how to run the usual political playbook around junior senators , and run them around the block .
But Trump is â€œrewriting the playbook , â€ � Christie says .
The best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November , on that stage last night , is undoubtedly Donald Trump .
Iâ€ ™ m happy to be on the Trump team
and I look forward to working with him .
â€œI am proud to be here to endorse Donald Trump for president , â€ � Christie says .
He says Donald and his family are old friends .
â€œThere is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needsâ€ � than Donald Trump .
Christie says he was on the debate stage and Trump is the only one up to the job .
â€œDonald
Trump is someone who when he makes a promise , he keeps it .
Iâ€ ™ ve experienced that over my long friendship with him.â€ �
Trump appears at his news conference .
He introduces ..
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a real talent.â€ �
Here comes Christie .
The Times agrees itâ€ ™ s big : What is it ?
Did Ivanka deliver ?
Update : no thatâ€ ™ s not
it , weâ€ ™ re advised .
Now some Dennis Rodman - slams - Ted Cruz action in the full - cafeteria food fight that is the 2016 Republican race : In one of his attacks on Trump last night , Cruz said that while he , Cruz , was fighting immigration reform in Congress , â€œWhere was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ � John Kasich half - threatened to assassinate Rodmanâ€ ™ s friend Kim Jong - un last night â€ “ and
the former NBA star decides to go after Cruz ?
OMG .
It is on .
Cruz and Rubio shook hands behind Trumpâ€ ™ s back during a break from the debate at which they mercilessly hammered him from right and left .
Maybe this is why Cruz optimistically said in a post - debate interview , â€œMarco
and I are friends.â€
�
Looks like theyâ€ ™ re enjoying themselves : ( h / t : @nickywoolf ) ... and makes fun of Trumpâ€ ™ s misspelling of â€œchoker.â€ �
This clip also has Rubio making fun of Trumpâ€ ™ s applying makeup backstage and Rubio saying Trump wanted to make sure his pants werenâ€ ™ t wet .
Is the backstage conduct of candidates at debates fair game ?
Isnâ€

Politics ainâ€ ™ t beanbag , if I see you applying makeup on your sweat mustache

2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney is really not letting this Donald Trump taxes thing go .
Weâ€ ™ d accuse him â€ “ based on his own refusal to release his taxes for months and months in 2012 , and the incompleteness of the release when it finally happened â€“of being a hypocrite .
But letâ€ ™ s give him a second chance and cheer him on :
For background on the Trump - Romney fight over Trumpâ€ ™ s taxes , see here .
This Trump tweet kind of captures the tone : The Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino witnessed a winning scene covering Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s visit to the Saffron cafÃ © and bakery in Charleston , South Carolina , this morning .
A groom , Joe Schreck , of Atlanta , and his 10 groomsmen had just orders a round of bloody Marys when she arrived , Lauren writes : They asked her for a photo .
When Clinton realized the man was getting married today , she turned to her staff : â€œheâ€ ™ s getting married today !
Thatâ€ ™ s pretty exciting.â€ �
Campaign photographer Barb Kinney tells them to kneel down , just like at the wedding .
A few of them kneel around her .
â€œI love having men at my feet , â€ � Clinton says .
They took several photos [ photos TK ] .
â€œThat looks like a really good Bloody Mary , â€ �
she said pointing to one of the menâ€ ™ s drinks .
Laurenâ€ ™ s coverage continues : Schreck invited Clinton to his wedding later that evening .
She said she wished she could attend and declined politely .
â€œMadame
President , â€ � pastry chef Mary Knochel , interrupted .
She was welding a sample basked of coconut pound cake .
â€œI got ta try this , â€ � Clinton said , plucking a piece of cake out of the sample basket and popping it into her mouth .
The two women spoke quietly to each other for a moment .
Knochel said she is a big supporter of Clinton , as he two women are from the same region , sheâ€ ™ s from Louisiana , and from the same generation .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve got to get all of these crumbs out of my mouth , â€ �
Clinton says chewing and smiling for more pictures .
While admiring , another rack of pastries , Clinton complimented the owner on his selection .
â€œYou got ta indulge here , â€ � Clinton said , facing the pool .
Schreck , the groom , is from Atlanta , but
heâ€ ™ s getting married in Charleston today at 5 .
Heâ€ ™ s still undecided about who he is going to vote for but said heâ€ ™ s a big fan of Clinton , especially now .
Asked what his fiancÃ
© e will say , he said : â€œsheâ€ ™ ll love it!â€ � Good question , dave_damage ( and thanks for reading ) !
Letâ€ ™ s see what advice you have for Mr Damage â€
“
hereâ€ ™ s a selection : Trump has corrected his earlier tweets misspelling â€œhonorâ€ � as â€œhonerâ€ � and â€œchokerâ€ � as â€œchocker.â€ � Second timeâ€ ™ s a charm :
Weâ€ ™ d say Trump deserves every credit for communicating with voters through a direct medium without a thousand layers of screening between .
If the price is an occasional misspelling , so what ?
Or is that going too easy on him ?
Can you imagine Hillary Clinton misspelling ... anything ?
From the comments : This will elevate the debate .
Rubio is not letting up on Trump , opening his first speech of the day with a minutes - long prologue attacking Trump .
Rubio even has made a pants - wetting joke : Hereâ€ ™ s the second poll in two days showing Donald Trump with a double - digit lead over Marco Rubio in Rubioâ€ ™ s home state of Florida .
Yesterday Quinnipiac published a poll with Trump up 44 - 28 .
Now Public Policy Polling measures
Trump up 20 : Rubio in his Today show appearance
this morning said his campaignâ€ ™ s own numbers show these polls to be way way off , and he said he knows Florida and heâ€ ™ s going to win there .
Is Trumpâ€ ™ s supposed strength in Florida really plausible ?
Weâ€

For the millions spent on polling the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire , writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi , the state - by - state surveys get a lot sketchier as the primary season proceeds : This past week has been all about state , rather than national , polling .
But as Super Tuesday fast approaches , there are lots of states where very little is known about voting intentions .
Even in states like Tennessee , which awards 58 Republican and 75 Democratic delegates , there isnâ€ ™ t all that much polling data .
Reliable polls are expensive to conduct at the best of times â€ “ all the more so when youâ€ ™ re trying to identify likely caucus - goers in places like Colorado or Kentucky .
As a result , the sample sizes of these polls shrink down to just a few hundred , in some cases meaning that the margin of error is much higher .
Basically , be cautious of primary polls - you can expect lots of the unexpected on March 1 .
The New York Timesâ€ ™ Upshot shop has produced a great interactive graphic depicting various paths for Trump or Rubio ( or one of the others ) to get to the Republican presidential nomination depending on how they perform on Super Tuesday on 1 March and then in the spate elections on 15 March ( they include the big winner - take - all prizes of Florida , Ohio , North Carolina , Illinois and Missouri ) .
You set dials according to what proportion of support
you think the various candidates will be winning before and after 15 March and the widget represents probabilities for outcomes .

Hillary Clinton avoided on Friday morning admittedly wildly premature questions about whether she would consider senator Elizabeth Warren to be her vice presidential pick , the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino writes :
â€œI canâ€ ™ t get presumptuous , â€ � Clinton said on MSNBC .
â€œRight now Iâ€ ™ ve got to win the nomination and then Iâ€ ™ m going to take a deep breath and maybe get a good nightâ€ ™
s sleep , and then start thinking about that important decision.â€
� Clinton also acknowledged some voters viewed her as untrustworthy .
â€œItâ€ ™ s hurtful to have people say , oh , I donâ€ ™ t trust her or
donâ€ ™ t know why sheâ€ ™ s doing it , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œAnd it suddenly struck me , well , maybe there is this underlying question like is she doing it for herself , or is she really in it for us ?
And Iâ€ ™ ve always thought of myself as being service - oriented.â€ �
Florida senator Marco Rubio turned up on the Today show to press his argument that Donald Trump is not a logical choice to carry the mantle of American conservatism .
â€œIâ€ ™ d prefer not to have a fight and an argument with other Republicans , but ... weâ€ ™ re on the verge of someone taking over the conservative movement in the Republican party whoâ€ ™ s a con artist ...
He has spent his career sticking it to working Americans , â€ � Rubio says .
Rubio also hits Trump for hiding his tax returns ( Rubio has promised to release his at the weekend ) :
The reason why Donald wonâ€ ™ t release his taxes is he because he hasnâ€ ™ t made nearly as much money as he claims he does ...
He is not as rich as he claims to be , everybody in finance knows that , and his taxes would expose that .
Rubio calls Trumpâ€ ™ s story that he canâ€ ™ t release his taxes because heâ€ ™ s being audited for being too strong of a Christian â€œabsurdâ€ � and â€œunreal.â€ � â€œIf you kill Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate , and the trial was in the Senate , nobody could convict you , â€ �
Republican senator Lindsey Graham said in remarks skewering his partyâ€ ™ s presidential field at the Washington press club foundation dinner on Thursday night .
The Texas senator , a contender for the Republican presidential nomination , is extremely unpopular among his congressional colleagues .
The dinner is convened by news organizations with a footprint in Washington and features stabs at comedy by elected officials .
It is not to be confused with the White House correspondentsâ€ ™ association dinner , which in recent years has become celebrity - filled and at which the president typically speaks .
The Republican party has gone â€œbatshit crazyâ€ � , Graham told the crowd , referring to the presidential race .
And he noted that he himself had dropped out of this yearâ€ ™ s presidential race and promptly endorsed former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who subsequently dropped out .
Graham put on a white â€œMake America Great Againâ€ � hat and said : â€œI endorse Donald Trump and hope the Graham magic still exists!â€

In reference to Cruzâ€ ™ s birth in Canada and the false belief held by about 10 % of self - identified conservatives that Barack Obama was born in Africa , he added : â€œI will say that our Canadian is better than your Kenyan.â€ �
He continued : â€œI know exactly when Ted is going to drop out of the race .

Grahamâ€ ™ s home state , and the city is hosting a Canadian - American Days festival beginning March 12 .
Graham had some zingers for Florida senator Marco Rubio , too , whom Graham called â€œthe boy wonderâ€
� .
Rubio is 44 , about five months younger than Cruz .
â€œIâ€
™ m not saying he would change his positions , but he would change his positions , â€ � Graham said , in reference perhaps to Rubioâ€ ™ s calibration on immigration reform .
â€œThe Secret Serviceâ€ ™ s
main job
if heâ€

Trumpâ€ ™
s spellcheck appears to be broken this ayem .
Will this be the outrage that sinks his candidacy ?
Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Did you watch last nightâ€ ™ s Republican debate ?
Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz ganged up on Donald Trump in an effort to take the frontrunner down a notch .
Trump often gave as good as he got , although Rubio tagged him pretty good by pointing out that Trump could not describe his healthcare policy in any depth beyond â€œitâ€ ™ ll be beautifulâ€ � .
Trump apparently sat bolt upright in bed this morning and began throwing punches again , jumping on Twitter to call Rubio a â€œchockerâ€ � : â€œTheyâ€ ™ re desperate â€ “
I mean what are they going to do ,
theyâ€ ™ re losing by massive amounts , â€ �
Trump said of his senatorial rivals last night .
And this : â€œI think
itâ€ ™ s going to be over fairly quickly , and I donâ€
™ t think
thereâ€ ™ s going to be a [ contested ] convention.â€ �
In Democrat - land , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton popped up this morning on MSNBC and said she had already undergone the process of careful scrutiny that could snag less experienced pols .
â€œI have withstood all this .
I have been vetted , â€ �
she said .
She also took a swipe at Trump , saying he â€œtraffics in a lot of â€˜prejudice and paranoiaâ€ ™ â€ � .
Clinton : I am not a natural politician like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama , and so for me it really came through the route of service .
Last night Clinton was in Charleston , South Carolina , which votes on Saturday , and she took the stage with Charlie Wilson , the former Gap Band frontman , in a moment captured by the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino .
With moves like that , how can she not be 20 points up in SC ?
Today our correspondents are in Nashville , Tennessee ( a Super Tuesday state ) ; Columbia , South Carolina ; and across the west to take the measure of whether and how the race is twisting in advance of the cascade of voting on 1 March .
Thanks for joining us , and letâ€ ™ s hear your take in the comments !"
2016-02-26,"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz just woke up to the fact that theyâ€ ™ re losing the Republican nomination to a reality - show star and real estate mogul .
Thatâ€ ™ s the only way to explain their spirited bid to draw Trumpâ€ ™ s blood in the latest Republican debate on Thursday .
Too bad they didnâ€
™ t put on such a performance earlier .
If Rubio is robotic , then he has suddenly turned into the Terminator .
From the start of the debate and then over and over , Rubio went after Trump .
And he did so in a rather clever way .
Often using mockery â€ “ and almost always smiling â€ “ he attacked Trumpâ€ ™ s supposed strengths .
He said Trump was soft on immigration , wondering if Trump would use undocumented workers to build his promised border wall with Mexico , just as he said he allegedly did to build the Trump Tower in New York .
Rubio attacked Trumpâ€ ™ s business acumen .
He said if Trump hadnâ€ ™ t inherited so much wealth from his father , heâ€ ™ d be selling watches on the street in Manhattan .
Rubio attacked , attacked , attacked on everything from the Trump University to Trumpâ€ ™ s healthcare plan to Trump foreign policy knowledge .
And when Trump responded by recalling Rubioâ€ ™ s mental hiccup a few weeks ago before the New Hampshire primary , Rubio laughed it off , saying Trump himself had just repeated himself fives times in the past five seconds .
Cruz pursued a different , more typical attack vector , hitting Trump as a faux Republican with long - time ties to some of the partyâ€ ™ s most despised opponents such as Hillary Clinton and Nevada Senator Harry Reid .
Sure , Cruz nicked Rubio from time to time , but it seemed perfunctory .
We donâ€
™ t know if Rubio and Cruz were consciously working in tandem , but they might as well have been .
It was almost as if Rubioâ€ ™ s job was too peel off Trumpâ€ ™ s teflon by exposing him a phony and pretender so Cruzâ€
™ s more traditional attacks could better find their mark .
And between Cruz and Rubio , the debate often looked like Rubio was the main challenger to Trump .
Trump has been ridiculed as an internet comments section come to life .
In Houston , Cruz and Rubio â€ “ while Ben Carson and John Kasich stayed on debate cruise control
â€ “ were like an opposition research book come to life .
And one look at a rattled and flustered Trump shows what an effective strategy it might have been had it been tried , say , back in summer of last year or in the autumn .
Imagine if in debate after debate , Trumpâ€ ™ s
rivals had attacked him repeatedly as a charlatan and policy dunce â€ “ with considerable disrespect for the Great Man .
If billionaire businessman Donald Trump ends up being the Republican presidential nominee , many party regulars and conservatives may again see the debates as a key inflection point .
That was the lesson learned from Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s fate , who most Republicans thought would defeat Barack Obama in 2012 .
If you ask conservative die - hards what Romney could have done differently ( this is still wistfully discussed ) , they often will point to the presidential debates that year .
Many feel an aggressive Romney dominated Obama in the first debate , and then eased off the next two .
If only , if only , if only â€ ¦ Many regular Republicans and conservative activists may spend a great deal of time imagining just such a â€œwhat ifâ€ � scenario in the weeks and months ahead .
Not only do polls suggest Trump will be the winner of
next weekâ€ ™ s southern Super Tuesday
, Trump may even keep it a close race in Cruzâ€ ™ s Texas .
Trump is also currently ahead in Rubioâ€ ™ s Florida , which holds its primary in the middle of the month .
The hour is very , very late .
Trump has a core group of believers who are not the kind who typically vote in Republican primaries .
They are unlikely to be shaken loose by any debate performance or clever television ad .
But are there enough of the more traditional conservatives â€ “ ones who believe in the Reaganite value of limited government , low taxes and peace through strength â€ “ who can yet be awakened from their Trumpian fever dream ?
And did donors see enough from Cruz and Rubio to finance a major anti - Trump effort ?
We wonâ€
™ t have to wait too long for the answers , even though Republicans may wondering â€œif only , if only , if onlyâ€ � for a long , long time ."

Trump said he couldnâ€ ™ t release his tax returns because he was being audited and his lawyers wouldnâ€ ™ t let him release them .
Trump dismissed polls that showed him performing miserably among Hispanic voters .

Theyâ€ ™ re incredible people.â€ � Ohio governor John Kasich made repeated calls for greater seriousness of purpose as Dr Ben Carson called for greater time for himself to speak .

The answers about Apple are quite disappointing , finds James Pethokoukis .
Isnâ€
™ t this the party of small government ?
In the Apple encryption question , all the Republicans are ignoring what a tremendous bit of government over - reach this is .
The GOP is supposed to be the small government party , and at least the candidates should raise an eyebrow when government is ignoring a companyâ€ ™ s claims that a federal order would trash its products and marketplace position .
Tech advances will almost inevitably lead to an age of ubiquitous encryption .
The common - sense answer here is the one that Apple boss Tim Cook and some in Congress are proposing : scrap the governmentâ€ ™ s court order and instead form a government commission of experts to provide recommendations that balance corporate interests , privacy , and national security .
Also not a great moment for the GOP trying to make inroads into Silicon Valley .

â€œApple doesnâ€ ™ t want to do it because they think it hurts their brand .
Well let me tell you their brand isnâ€ ™ t superior to the national security of America , â€ � Rubio says .
Cruz agrees , saying Apple should be required to comply with the search order , because it applies to only one phone , not to all phones .
â€œOn the question of unlocking this cell phone ...
we should enforce the court order ..
Apple doesnâ€ ™ t have a right.â€ �
Carson agrees .
â€œIf they donâ€
™ t comply with that , youâ€ ™ re encouraging chaos in our system.â€
�
Kasich says , â€œyou know what the problem is , whereâ€ ™ s the president been?â€ �
He says the president should have â€œlocked the doorâ€ � on a meeting between intelligence community folks and Apple until they compromise .
And kept the whole thing out of the newspapers .
Cruz to Trump : â€œFor 40 years youâ€ ™ ve been funding liberal politicians.â€
�
Trump : â€œI funded you.â€ �
Cruz admits
Trump gave him five grand .
Then there is a big messy Cruz - Rubio - Trump mess .
Blitzer gets control back with effort .
Interesting Beck boost for Rubio : Cruz now says
heâ€ ™ s going to upload an interview to his web site in which Trump advocates for toppling Gaddafi , despite Trumpâ€ ™ s just having said he never wanted to remove Gaddafi .
â€œIf you care about Israel , you donâ€ ™ t write checks to politicians that are undermining Israel , â€ � Cruz says .
Kasich tries to talk
but Blitzer says Trump gets to because he was attacked .
â€œThere is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have ...
you are all talk and no action ,
â€ �
Trump says .
Then Trump gestures respectively to Rubio and Cruz : â€œFirst of all , this guyâ€ ™ s a choke artist and this guyâ€ ™ s a liar.â€ �
Carson gets a big cheer with the line : â€œCan someone attack me please?â€ �
Trump is asked about a prospective ceasefire in Syria .
He says â€œitâ€ ™ s a meaningless cease
fireâ€ �
so he doesnâ€
™ t support this particular deal .
Cruz says heâ€ ™ s hopeful but skeptical .
Then he says Russia has strengthened its position because the Obama administration had given Russia the region .
Then Cruz says Trump and Rubio supported the Obama Libya policy and Rubio supported John Kerry for secretary of state .
Trump says he never supported deposing Gaddafi .
Rubio says he supported Kerry to get Clinton out of the state department .
Dr Carson , how would you deal with North Korea ?
â€œPeople say I whine a lot because I donâ€ ™ t get enough time .
Iâ€ ™ m going to whine
, â€ � says Carson .
â€œBecause
I didnâ€
™ t get asked about taxes .
I didnâ€ ™ t get asked about Israel.â€ �
Wolf tells Carson to go for it .
â€œThis is your time.â€ �
Carson says the IRS â€œis not honest and we need to get rid of them.â€ �
Carson says he went to Israel a couple months ago and talked to a lot of people and none of them did not think that the United States had not turned its back on Israel .
Carson says Kim Jong - Un is unstable but understands strength and that the United States should strengthen regional alliances and develop a strategic defense initiative .
Kasich is back to North Korea .
Heâ€
™ s asked whether he would assassinate Kim Jong - Un .
He says Chinese intervention is needed in North Korea .
â€œYou look for any measure you can to be able to solve the problem , â€ � Kasich says .
But would he risk war for regime change ?
â€œIf there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea , and create stability ... but Iâ€ ™ m also aware of the fact that there are 10 m people in Seoul ... perhaps the Chinese can accomplish that working with this man who is now the leader , â€ � Kasich says .
Trump gets the North Korea question and he starts talking about defending Japan â€œfor peanuts.â€ � Kasich is up .
He seems to get dinged almost immediately , after a jag he takes into North Korea policy .
Rubio is up .
He accuses Trump of taking an â€œanti - Israel position.â€
�
He says you canâ€ ™ t be an honest broker when â€œone side acts in bad faith.â€ �
Then Rubio and Trump get in another slapfight , with a pretty good line from Rubio about the Palestinians not being a real estate deal .
â€œA deal between Israel and the Palestinians , given the current makeup of the Palestinians , is not possible , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œI will be on Israelâ€ ™ s side every day.â€ �
Trump : Iâ€ ™ m a negotiator .
I have done very well over the years .
Rubio :
The Palestinians are not a real estate deal .
Trump :
A deal is a deal .
Rubio : Not dealing with terrorists .
Have you ever dealt with terrorists ?
Trump : You will never bring peace .
Theyâ€ ™ re back !
Question for Trump .
You said you wanted to be â€œneutralâ€
� in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
How can that be when Israel is Americaâ€ ™ s closest ally in the Middle East ?
â€œAs president there is nothing that I would rather do than to bring peace to Israel and itâ€ ™ s neighbors generally , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t help if I start saying â€
“
I am very pro - Israel ..
but it doesnâ€ ™ t do anything to start demeaning the neighbors.â€ � â€œWith that being said , I am totally pro - Israel.â€ � Cruz : â€œThis is another area in which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton ...
If Iâ€ ™ m president , America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel ...
it is not equivalent.â€ �
Trump continues to imagine brokering a Middle East peace as president : â€œIf I could bring peace , that would be a fantastic thing , it would be one of my greatest achievements as president.â€
�
OK folks , commercial break after only one hour .
Whoâ€ ™ s winning ?
Tell us in the comments ?
Trump is comparing his poll numbers with Cruz : â€œA poll just came out in Bloomberg where Iâ€ ™ m beating him so badly ,
Iâ€ ™ m embarrassed.â€ � â€œHillary Clinton , take a look at USA Today ...
I beat her and I beat her badly ... and I havenâ€ ™ t even started with her ...
â€ �
Trump said he mixed it up with her a few weeks ago when her camp accused him of being sexist , â€œand believe me , they had a rough weekend that weekend ,
between Bill and Hillary , they had a rough weekend.â€ � Cruz then jumps in and accuses Trump of being a past Clinton admirer .
â€œOn substance , how do we nominate a candidate who said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times?â€ � Cruz asks .
Cruz says Trump â€œcanâ€ ™ t take it to [ Clinton ] and beat her on the debate stage and the polls.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s reply is sharp and is cheered loudly : â€œIf
I canâ€
™ t beat her youâ€ ™ re really going to get killed wonâ€ ™ t you
, â€ � he says .
Then Trump pats Rubio and Cruz on the head
: I know youâ€ ™ re embarrassed , I know youâ€ ™ re embarrassed .
Keep fighting keep swinging .
Swing for the fences .
Swing for the fences .
Trump is asked about Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s assertion that there is a â€œbombshellâ€ � in Trumpâ€ ™ s taxes , pertaining perhaps to his wealth or charitable giving being smaller than he makes out .
â€œI was the first one to file a financial disclosure form ...
You donâ€ ™ t learn anything about someoneâ€ ™ s wealth from a tax return ....
people were shocked , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI will say this .
Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed , and Harry Reid baited him so beautifullyâ€ � on releasing his tax returns .
â€œAs far as my return , I want to file them .
Except for ... I will absolutely give my returns but Iâ€ ™ m being audited now for two or three years .
So I canâ€ ™ tâ€ � turn over the returns until the audit is through .
Trump is pressed by a moderator .
â€œI want to release my tax returns , but I canâ€ ™ t release them if Iâ€ ™ m under an audit , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re under a routine audit .
As soon as the audit is doneâ€ � Iâ€ ™ ll release them .
Question goes to Rubio .
When will you release your returns ?
He answers simply : â€œTomorrow or Saturday ... and luckily Iâ€ ™ m not being audited this year , or last year.â€ � Cruz then hits Trump over his admission that heâ€ ™ s being audited .
â€œDonald says heâ€ ™ s being audited .
Well I would think that would underscore the need to see those returns.â€
�
Twitter metrics , via Twitter .
Looks like the polls in Florida .
Wow that image renders tinily .
Hereâ€ ™ s what it says .
The share of the Twitter conversation thus far is split like so :
Trump 51 % Rubio 23 % Cruz 14 % Carson 7 % Kasich 5 % Cruz insists on answering the Obamacare question and uses it to bludgeon Trump .
He says that Trump likes Planned Parenthood , while he would investigate it and prosecute any infractions .
Cruz then accuses Trump of â€œadvocating socialized medicine : â€ � Donald wants to end it because he says that it doesnâ€ ™ t nearly go far enough . ...
For decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine ...
If youâ€ ™ re a small business owners , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s socialized health care will kill more jobs than Obamacare .
Cruz to Trump : â€œTrue or false
: you said the government should pay for everyoneâ€ ™ s health care.â€ �
Trump says â€œfalseâ€ � .
Then Cruz brings up a line from a couple debates ago , in which Trump said he would not let people â€œdie on the sidewalk.â€ �
Trump stands by his position : â€œI will not let people die on the streets if Iâ€ ™ m president.â€ �
Then Trump manages a moment of humanity , which strangely under the force of Cruzâ€
™ s cross - examination feels like some kind of moment of grace :
Let me talk .
Weâ€
™ re going to have private health care .
I am not going to let people die on the streets or the sidewalks of this country , if I am president .
You might be fine with it .
Iâ€ ™ m not fine with it .
Who is doing best so far ?
Jeb Lund thinks Marco Rubio is putting on a good performance â€ “ but should stop laughing at his own jokes Marco Rubio is doing very well .
He hit Trump smartly on apt points , and he even had a good punchline .
Cruz isnâ€ ™ t doing as well as Rubio , which should probably be alarming for Cruz supporters , because heâ€ ™ s the one who should be tap - dancing around everyone on stage .
Kasich seems pleased to talk when people remember him and just as pleased to watch when no one does .
Ben Carson was let out by the roadside to run free through a meadow as mom and dad peeled off in the car .
That said , itâ€ ™ s a foolâ€ ™ s game to think that the normal rules of debates apply here .
Rubioâ€ ™ s shots on Trump and his one - liner would have been body blows to any candidate who was running as a candidate .
But Trump is still Trump , a personality rather than a candidacy , fame rather than a campaign .
And ultimately everything Rubio just said probably isnâ€ ™ t going to matter to anyone leaning toward Trump .
Yeah , sure , Trump employed immigrants .
But Iâ€ ™ m a Trump supporter , and I like Trump , thatâ€ ™ s just a canny move .
He saved money !
He knew the game was rigged , and he played it .
He got sued â€
”
so what ?
Heâ€
™ s a famous rich guy , they get sued all the time .
Trumpâ€ ™
s playing a different game , which is scored differently among the fanbase .
When he owns someone , it rules .
When people bite back , itâ€ ™ s annoying .
If they bite back too much , theyâ€ ™ re desperate .
( Also , for as many good lines as Rubioâ€ ™ s getting in on him tonight , Rubio is clearly enjoying them the most of all , which is just bad form .
Donâ€ ™ t enjoy your joke more than I can , man .
Thatâ€ ™ s amateur hour .
Act like youâ€ ™ re not stunned that this is the first time your brain thought of something clever . )
On top of that , these guys are trying to work Trump , and
heâ€ ™ s working the room .
Thereâ€ ™ s something kind of final about the way that he can turn to them and engage , then turn to the moderators and the room and act as if theyâ€ ™ ve vanished .
At some point , he remembers that the other two donâ€ ™ t actually matter , and it shows .
Next up : the Affordable Care Act .
Rubio accuses Trump of liking the individual mandate in the law , which requires people to carry health insurance .
Rubio reels into his own castle - in - the - clouds plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare .
He says the law is not only bad for health care , itâ€ ™ s a â€œjob - killing law.â€ �
Trump says he would throw out Obamacare ... but keep requirements that insurers cover pre - existing conditions .
â€œI agree with that 100 % except pre - existing conditions , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI want to keep pre - existing condition .
I think we need it
I think itâ€ ™ s the modern age
and I think we have to have it.â€
�
Then he says â€œthe insurance companies are making a fortune with every thing they do.â€
�
He doesnâ€ ™ t mention medical products manufacturers and drug companies , who are making the bigger fortunes .
â€œI know the insurance companies , theyâ€ ™ re friends of mine .
One of them is in the audience , he was just waving to me , he was just laughing â€
“ heâ€
™ s not laughing so much anymore .
Hi.â€
�
Trump says he would erase the lines between states , meaning set up national interstate competition in the insurance market .
Then Rubio mounts the most effective attack of the night so far at Trump .
â€œYou may not be aware of this Donald , because you donâ€ ™ t follow this stuff very closely , but hereâ€ ™ s what happened , â€ � Rubio says .
He says Obamacare included a bailout for insurance companies who couldnâ€ ™ t sustain the initial costs of the new law .
â€œWhat is your plan?â€ � Rubio challenges Trump .
Erase the lines ?
Trump accuses Rubio of not knowing about state markets : â€œThe biggest problem heâ€ ™ s got is he really doesnâ€
™ t know about the lines .
I watched him melt down two weeks ago with Chris Christie.â€
�
Rubio persists : â€œYour only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states .
What else is your plan?â€ �
Trump : â€œyouâ€ ™ ll get rid of the lines ...
â€ �
Rubio :
So thatâ€ ™ s the only part of the plan ?
Just the lines ?
Trump :
Youâ€ ™ ll have many different plans .
Youâ€ ™ ll have competition .
Itâ€ ™ ll be beautiful .
Rubio :
Now heâ€ ™ s repeating himself !
Trump : I watched him repeat himself five time two weeks ago !
Rubio : I watched him repeat himself five times five second ago !
Rubio :
He says five things .
Everyonâ€ ™ es dumb .
Heâ€ ™ s gon na make America great again , werâ€
™
e gon na win win win , and the lines around the states .
Moderator Dana Bash :
Mr Trump , anything to add ?
Trump :
No !
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing to add .
What is to add ?
What is to add ?
Trump just appeared not to have a health care reform plan any deeper than â€œweâ€ ™ ll create competition and itâ€ ™ ll be beautiful.â€ � Ding .
Ding .
Ding .
Republicans , at least Marco Rubio , finally figured out how to go after Donald Trump .
Rather than tagging him as a New York City liberal , you go after his supposed strengths .
You say he is phoney on issues , not much of a businessman and hardly a friend of the common man .
And you press the issue machine - gun style , over and over and get under his skin .
Rubio did that when he accused him of hiring undocumented immigrants for his Trump University .
Even Cruz jumped , forming a brief alliance with Rubio .
Perhaps for the first time during these debates , Trump looked rattled , even petulant .
Weâ€ ™ ll see if Rubio and Cruz can keep it up during the rest of this debate and coming weeks .
Rubioâ€ ™ s claim that the GOP is â€œthe party of diversityâ€ � only proves the hollowness of â€œdiversityâ€ � .
Yes , there are two candidates of Latino descent in the race , and Ben Carson .
But painting the face of a racist system a different color does not stop its racist operations .
This is , after all , the party whose front - runner paints an entire country as rapists and who whipped - up racialized fears during the Central Park 5 case .
For voters who care about diversity , more representation will do nothing to undo the damage wreaked by Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s harmful comments .
Kasich answers a question and Carson answers a question .
They feel like a sideshow to this : Anybody remember the movie ?
Who wins this fight ?
Rubio says he doubts that Trump would appoint a real conservative to the Supreme Court .
Trump invokes Reagan to say that itâ€ ™ s OK to evolve .
Trump doesnâ€ ™ t admit that he personally has evolved on issues such as abortion .
But then he rather daringly slides into a measured defense of Planned Parenthood : Millions of millions of women , cervical cancer , breast cancer , are helped by Planned Parenthood ...
I would defund it because Iâ€ ™ m pro - life .
But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood .
Trump is asked whether â€œreligious libertyâ€ � would be a litmus test for â€œall court employees.â€ �
He opts to hit Cruz over a vote in favor of the nomination of John Roberts .
â€œJustice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted .
Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare .
It might as well be called Robertscare , â€ � says Cruz .
â€œThat is a rough thing , and I know Ted probably feels badly about it ... but that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for ...
Ted very very strongly pushed Justice Roberts.â€ �
Cruz replies : â€œYes itâ€ ™ s true , I supported the Republican nominee once it was made.â€ �
Then he opts to list all the Democrats that Trump has given money to over the year .
He accuses Trump of being willing to â€œcut a dealâ€ � on the Supreme Court instead of taking a stand .
â€œLet me tell you Donald , I will not apologize for a minute over ... defending the Bill of Rights , â€ � Cruz says .
Rubio is taking a break for a moment while Cruz beats up on Trump .
They are tag - teaming .
Supreme Court question for Cruz .
Pitching to his sweet spot .
Cruz basically says that if a Democrat is elected president Americans will lose all their guns and their god and cats and dogs etc .
â€œFor voters who care about life , or marriage , or religious liberty or the second amendment
... I give you my word ,
every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.â€ � Applause .
Carson â€ “ who is indeed sporting a nontraditional elegant striped tie â€
“ takes a question about whether he thinks GOP rhetoric alienates Latino voters .
Carson calls for â€œliberty and justiceâ€ � for all .
He said that before too .
He says that ending dependence and creating opportunity will help everybody .
ArrarÃ¡s goes back to Trump .
â€œA brand new Telemundo poll says that 3 of 4 Hispanics nationwide have a negative opinion of you.â€ �
Trump : â€œFirst of all
, I donâ€ ™ t believe a thing Telemundo says.â€
� Funny and gets laughs .
Then Trump : I currently employ thousands of Hispanics , and over the years I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics .
Theyâ€ ™ re incredible people .
Then he starts talking about his crushing Nevada win , including among Hispanics .
ArrarÃ¡s persists .
A Washington Post poll showed 80 % of voters have a negative opinion of you .
Trump tries to interrupt her .
â€œLet me finish , â€ � she says .
She insists that Hispanic voters are leery of Trump .
He denies it .
â€œIâ€
™ m just telling you , Iâ€ ™ m doing very well with Hispanics .
And as you know , I settled my suit with Univision ...
weâ€
™ re good friends now ...
I will do really well
Hispanics.â€ �
He fought with Univision over airing a beauty pageant .
ArrarÃ¡s asks Kasich about whether the Republican party does not need to widen its aperture on immigration .
â€œWell , Iâ€ ™ m not gon na talk about that , â€ � he says , uncharmingly .
Then he makes the same argument Cruz did .
If you create economic growth , everything follows .
Kasich has an addendum : â€œWe have to create the sense that everyone can rise.â€ �
Cruz did not mention that part .
Kasich concludes : â€œWith me and the Hispanic community , I think they like me , and I appreciate that.â€ �
ArrarÃ¡s says
thereâ€
™ s a perception
that Cruz and Rubio are â€œmissing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican baseâ€ � by taking a hard line on immigration instead of talking to Latino constituencies .
Cruz says it is amazing that two of the five onstage are the children of Cuban immigrants .
Then he trashes the media which he says has constructed a myth that if youâ€ ™ re Hispanic you have to be liberal .
Cruz argues that â€œthe Obama economyâ€ � has hurt â€œthe Hispanic communityâ€ � the most and that he would help , in short , by creating economic growth .
Rubio points out that in addition to the immigrant sons onstage there is an African American .
â€œWe are the party of diversity , not the Democratic party , â€ �
Rubio says .
Applause .
Trump is silent .
Rubio is winning applause .
Telemundoâ€ ™ MarÃ­a Celeste ArrarÃ¡s goes into the weeds with Rubio on his policy for DREAmers , undocumented migrants who arrived as children to the United States .
Rubio unspools a fluent answer claiming absolute consistency .
Trump jumps in rather lamely : He lied .
He lied .
100 % Rubio smiles and returns fire : You lied to the Polish workers .
You lied to the students of Trump University .
Trump mumbles something about that being the past .
â€œYou lied to them eight years ago , â€ � says Rubio .
â€œI guess
thereâ€
™ s a statute of limitations on lies?â€
�
The crowd likes that line .
To Trump : You want to build a wall .
But Mexican leaders say that will never happen .
In fact Vicente Fox said , Quote : â€œIâ€ ™ m not going to pay for that quote , effing wall.â€
�
How will Trump get Mexico to pay ?
Trump : â€œI will .
And that wall just got 10 feet taller.â€ �
Then Trump objects to Foxâ€ ™ s profanity :
â€œI tell you , if I would have used even half of that word , â€ � it wouldâ€ ™ ve been a scandal .
â€œThis guy used a filthy disgusting word on TV , and he should be ashamed of himself and he should apologize.â€ �
Trump says the wall would be 1,000 miles long and cost $ 10bn-$12bn and â€œitâ€ ™ s a real wall.â€ � â€œMexico will pay for it because they are not doing us any favors.â€
�
Then Rubio cuts loose with a highly prepped slam : If he builds the wall the way he builds Mar - a - Lago heâ€ ™ ll be using illegal workers to do it .
Your ties and clothes he made are made in Mexico and China .
Make them in America !
Trump :
â€œYou donâ€ ™ t know a think about business .
You donâ€ ™ t know anything about it.â€ � Rubio back with a hit : â€œI donâ€ ™ t know anything about bankrupting companies either.â€ �
Then he hits Trump over lawsuits against a university that used to bear his name .
Rubio is unloading the oppo arsenal onstage .
Trump is wound up .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s a guy that buys a house for $ 179,000
, he sells it for $ 380,000 to a lobbyist , probably whoâ€ ™ s here!â€ �
Rubio is not letting up :
â€œHereâ€ ™ s a guy that inherited $ 200m!â€ � Update : inre Donald and the F word : Now to Kasich .
He starts by pointing out the elder Bushâ€ ™ s presence in the audience .
He holds up the Bush era as a time when the parties could work together , in tacit contrast with what weâ€ ™ re witnessing onstage .
Then Kasich says he would take care of immigration reform first thing as president .
Carson is asked about his beliefs on immigration .
He says â€œI believe in liberty and justice for all.â€ �
Then he warns terrorists are trying to cross the border .
Then he calls for boosting the Mexican economy .
He mentions China too .
Cruz says he finds it funny that Trump pretends he invented the immigration issue .
He says when he was fighting the Gang of 8 immigration reform proposal , â€œWhere was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ �
Laugh line .
Then Trump hits Cruz for being unpopular .
â€œNobody likes you.â€ �
Trump : â€œI get along with everybody .
You get along with none of them ...
you donâ€
™ t have one Republican senator backing you , and you work with these people ...
you should be ashamed of yourself.â€ �
Cruz flips the attack .
â€œDonald , if you want to be liked in Washington , thatâ€ ™ s not a good attribute for president ,
â€ � he says .
He also hits Trump for hiring foreigners .
â€œAnyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldnâ€ ™ t be hiring illegal immigrants , â€ � Cruz says .
Trump hits back at Cruz , calling him duplicitous for leaving a 2012 loan from Goldman Sachs after financial disclosure forms .
Rubio says that he would secure the border â€œbefore we doing anything on immigration.â€ �
Then he turns to Trump : â€œa lot of these positions that heâ€ ™ s now taking are new to him.â€ �
He mentions a 2011 Trump position in favor of a path to citizenship and the fact that Trump criticized 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney for talking about â€œself - deportation.â€ � Rubio goes straight to the attack .
He then picks up on a New York Times report that Trump hired foreign workers on immigration visas instead of Americans at a Florida resort .
Trump defends himself : â€œAs far as the people that Iâ€ ™ ve hired ... during the absolute prime season ...
you could not get help , itâ€ ™ s the up season ...
everybody agrees with me on that .
They were part - time jobs .. because you couldnâ€ ™ t get help in that hot , hot section of Florida.â€ �
Then Trump defends his criticism of Mitt Romney : â€œHe shouldâ€ ™ ve won that election ...
he ran a terrible campaign , he was a terrible candidate , thatâ€ ™ s an election that shouldâ€ ™ ve been won.â€ � Applause .
But Rubio will not let him go : â€œYou did criticize him for using the term â€œself - deportation.â€ �
Then Rubio says , â€œyouâ€ ™ re the only one on this stage for hiring people to work illegally.â€ �
Trump has a great comeback : â€œIâ€ ™ m the only one on this stage
whoâ€ ™ s hired people.â€ �
Rubio keeps after Trump , accusing him of hiring workers from Poland .
He tells the audience to Google it .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve hired tens of thousands of people ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œMany from other countries , â€ � Rubio says .
Sizzling !
Cruz gets the Q.
He says â€œthe people who get forgotten in this debateâ€ � are the millions of â€œlegalâ€ � immigrants who are losing their jobs â€ “ because , he implies , of undocumented workers .
Cruz says letâ€ ™ s fight for legal immigrants instead of ones â€œwho break the law.â€ �
He says heâ€ ™ s led the fight against granting citizenship to undocumented migrants .
Then Trump brags about Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona endorsing him .
Thereâ€ ™ s some applause .
Some Trump fans in this crowd .
First Q is about immigration .
For Trump .
You want to remove 11 m undocumented migrants from the USA .
But in your words â€œthe good onesâ€ � can come back in .
Cruz wouldnâ€ ™ t allow that and calls your plan â€œamnesty.â€ �
Is it ?
â€œHe was in charge of amnesty , he was the leader , and you can ask Marco , â€ � too , Trump says .
Trump says the only reason itâ€ ™ s even an issue is because he brought it up .
â€œWe either have a country or we donâ€ ™ t have a country.â€ � Ben Carson : America is â€œheading off the abyss of destruction.â€ � A call for civility :
â€œMarco , Donald , Ted , John :
We will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other ...
Itâ€ ™ s not about us.â€ �
John Kasich :
My grandfather was a coal miner and my grandmother was an immigrant .
For viewers : You can do whatever you want to do in your life .
America is an amazing country .
Shoot for the stars .
Americaâ€ ™ s great and you can do it .
Marco Rubio : We have to decide the identity of America in the 21st century .
Ronald Reagan .
Conservatism .
Hopes and dreams .
Are we still that kind of party or one who â€œpreys on peopleâ€ ™ s anger and fears?â€
� Applause .
Ted Cruz : Welcome to Texas .
[ Applause . ]
I grew up here .
I graduated from high school here .
I am a senator from here .
Democrats tell me I didnâ€
™ t vote for you , but youâ€ ™ re doing what you said you would do .

Donald Trump :

Isis , Obamacare , our Swiss cheese borders .
Weâ€ ™ re gon na start winning again .

One last bit of news - of - day before the debate begins
: On Thursday , a group of New York political and civil rights operatives announced the launch of a new political action committee focused on African American voters , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Mahita Gajanan :
Worried that the 2016 election will see a low turnout of black voters , the activists formed the Black Votes Matter PAC to maximize black voter turnout in battleground states like Florida , Ohio , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and Virginia , the committee announced on Thursday .
The Black Votes Matter PAC will be run by Charlie King , who ran the New York state democratic party for Governor Andrew Cuomo and headed the reelection effort of Congressman Charlie Rangel .
â€œMany of the issues that Governor Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Heastie are fighting for here in New York are the issues that matter in Black communities across the country : a special prosecutor when police kill an unarmed individual ; criminal justice reform ; $ 15 minimum wage ; real growth opportunities for Black owned businesses ; meaningful education initiatives and paid family leave , â€ �
King said in a statement .
â€œWe will keep these issues on the front burner and make sure the candidates do too.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s a sampler of our politics coverage so far today :
Former Mexican president Vicente Fox has given an uncompromising response to Republican frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s plans to make Mexico pay for a wall along the US border with Mexico .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not going to pay for that fucking wall .
He should pay for it .
Heâ€
™ s got the money , â€ � Fox told Jorge Ramos on Fusion .
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is being interviewed by Chris Matthews on MSNBC in advance of the Republican debate .
Sanders starts off talking about Woody Guthrie and how he uses This Land

Super Tuesday primary contests , Donald Trump is being confronted with resurfaced allegations that he sexually assaulted and tried to rape a woman in the early 1990s , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Jon Swaine :
The woman alleged in a federal lawsuit in 1997 that Trump violated her â€œphysical and mental integrityâ€
� when he touched her intimately without consent after her boyfriend went into business with him , leaving her â€œemotionally devastated [ and ] distraughtâ€ � .
The woman , whom the Guardian is not naming , dropped the $ 125 m lawsuit in Manhattan the following month .
It coincided with a separate legal dispute between Trump and the womanâ€ ™ s then - boyfriend over an alleged breach of contract relating to their beauty pageant business venture .
Trump claimed at the time that the lawsuit alleging assault was aimed at pressuring him to settle the other dispute , which reportedly he did for a six - figure sum later that year .
On Wednesday , Trumpâ€ ™ s counsel Michael Cohen told a reporter for Mail Online that there was â€œno truthâ€ � to the lawsuitâ€ ™ s allegations .
â€œThe plaintiff in the matter ... would acknowledge the same , â€ � Cohen was quoted as saying .
Yet when asked by the Guardian whether she stood by the allegations detailed in the lawsuit , the woman said in a text message :
â€œYes.â€ � The woman , now a successful makeup artist in New York , declined to discuss the allegations in detail .

: The Guardianâ€ ™ s Tom Dart reports from a protest outside the debate venue at the University of Houston :
As smartly - dressed guests headed for the debate venue , several hundred protestors massed then marched along the edge of the security perimeter at the University of Houston campus , agitating for a variety of causes , among them Black Lives Matter , pro - immigration , anti - Trump and anti - Cruz .
Dozens were with Fight for $ 15 , calling for a $ 15 minimum wage .
GOP contenders including Donald Trump , Ben Carson and Marco Rubio rejected the idea of raising the minimum when the issue came up at last Novemberâ€ ™ s debate in Milwaukee , while Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have proposed an increase .
â€œItâ€ ™ s something that we need
, we have families that are struggling , â€ � said a demonstrator , Carlton , who works at a burger restaurant and goes to college while trying to take care of his three - year - old son by himself .
Another fast - food worker , Janice , 47 , said that she earns $ 8 an hour .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no way a human can live off that , â€ � she said .
She lives with five children , and a granddaughter she looks after , in a studio apartment .
â€œItâ€ ™ s real hard , â€ � she said .
â€œPrices go up and still my wage doesnâ€ ™ t go upâ€
¦ Everyone lives in one room .
Thatâ€ ™ s what $ 8 is doing for me right now.â€
�
She had no strong opinions about the politicians who were soon to take the stage a couple of hundred metres away - while they indulge in rhetoric , her focus is on practical and immediate matters .
â€œIâ€ ™ m trying to get a roof over my head
, â€ � she said .
Googleâ€ ™ s at the Houston debate and theyâ€ ™ ve produced a 360-degree view of what the room looks like from Trumpâ€ ™ s podium : It seems like it would be hard to think in there ?
So loudly colorful and lights and purple seats and too many shapes
â€ “ and this is without Wolf Blitzer .
The debate isnâ€ ™ t scheduled to start for more than an hour , and if it starts on time thatâ€ ™ ll be a first .
So letâ€ ™ s detour for a moment to Vermont senator Bernie Sanderâ€
™ s visit to Flint , Michigan , today .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ryan Felton reports : Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called the lead contamination crisis in Flint , Michigan , â€œone of the more serious public health crises in the modern history of this countryâ€
� as he addressed community members in his first visit to the city .
With the Michigan presidential primary looming on 8 March , Sanders addressed a crowd of some 300 residents in a church , saying he hoped that â€œout of the tragedyâ€ � would come â€œfundamental changes in public policy.â€ � â€œIn Flint , the situation may be more extreme , but all over this country , our infrastructure is crumbling ,
â€ �
Sanders told a majority - white crowd .
The Vermont senator said he has proposed a $ 1 trillion infrastructure program that aims to â€œprovide safe drinking waterâ€ � and create â€œmillions of decent paying jobs.â€ � â€œIt is my hope that the American people will look at Flint and say never again , â€ � he said .
In answer to one question , he renewed his call for Michigan governor Rick Snyder to resign .
â€œThe dereliction of this community has been so extraordinary , that I think in good conscious he should resign , â€ � he said .
Snyder , a Republican , has rebuffed calls to step down .
At the close of the event , Sanders said the US has to help â€œrebuild Flintâ€ � and â€œget our priorities right.â€ � Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 10th Republican presidential debate in the 2016 race for the White House .

With only five days to go till 12 states vote on so - called Super Tuesday , itâ€ ™ s do - or - die night for would - be rivals who might take out Donald Trump .
The question is , what could they possibly do on the debate stage that would change things ?
Trump has won the last three state contests running away , and itâ€ ™ s hard to find an upcoming state where he looks vulnerable .
A new Quinnipiac poll of Florida Republicans , for example , measured Trump ahead of Senator Marco Rubio by 16 points , 44 - 28 .
Marco Rubio is from Florida .
Tonight weâ€ ™ re looking for Rubio and Texas senator Ted Cruz to go all Eight Mile on the frontrunner ( and yes weâ€ ™ re aware thatâ€ ™ s Dr Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s song ) .
If there was any reason for them to pull punches before , it disappeared in Trumpâ€ ™ s 46 % crusher win in Nevada on Tuesday .
Trump won across every demographic .

Why : pick a GOP nominee"
2016-02-28,"The specter of Donald Trump as an elected nominee for president pushed his Republican opponents to desperate measures on Sunday , two days before a dozen states could vote to give the billionaire a huge lead in the 2016 contest .
Marco Rubio predicted he could win the nomination without winning a state , while Ted Cruz raised allegations that Trump once contracted a mafia - owned company .
Though no Republican votes were cast this weekend , Trump presided proudly over the campaign â€ “ to the extent that Hillary Clinton , the Democratic victor in South Carolina , aimed her victory speech his way and not towards Bernie Sanders .
On Friday two sitting governors endorsed Trump ; on Saturday two former presidents of Mexico compared him to Hitler ; and on Sunday he initially declined to condemn a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan â€ “ even though he had disavowed the manâ€ ™ s endorsement two days earlier .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know anything about what youâ€ ™ re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists , â€ �
Trump told CNN , insisting he had never heard of David Duke , a former grand wizard of the group .
â€œCertainly I would disavow it if I thought there was something wrong , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œIf
you send me a list of groups , Iâ€ ™ ll let you know.â€ �
The refusal to pass judgment on the former Klansman directly contradicted what Trump told reporters on Friday â€ “ as he eventually pointed out on Sunday .
His claim to know nothing about Duke also contradicted a statement he made in 2000 , when he called Duke â€œa Klansmanâ€ � and said : â€œThis is not company I wish to keep.â€ � Cruz , the Texas senator and hardline conservative who defeated Trump in Iowa thanks to evangelical voters , appeared on all five main political talk shows on Sunday morning to argue that his hopes of sweeping the south had not been shattered .
Cruz described Trump as a fairweather conservative who lacked judgment , telling CNN that if the businessman were president , â€œwho the heck knows what he would do ?
Even Donald doesnâ€ ™ t know what he would do.â€
�
He later speculated that Trump has refused to release his tax returns because he wants to hide â€œbusiness dealings with the mob , with the mafiaâ€ � .
The senator then alluded to allegations raised in a biography of Trump regarding business contracts with the S&amp;A Concrete company , which was run in the 1980s by Anthony Salerno , whom Cruz said was â€œa mobster who is in jailâ€ � .
Salerno died in prison in 1992 .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t know what it is
that heâ€
™ s hiding in his tax returns , â€ � Cruz said .
Trump repeatedly dismissed calls to release his returns on Sunday , claiming that a tax audit prohibited the release .
There is no legal restriction against doing so .
Marco Rubio , the Florida senator who has racked up endorsements from Republican congressmen and governors without having won a state , insisted that he could still win the nomination .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t care how long I have to work , â€ � Rubio told Fox News Sunday of his commitment to defeating Trump .
â€œI will go to every state and every territory.â€ �
Pressed on whether he could win the nomination if he were to lose every state in this weekâ€ ™ s elections , the 12-state â€œSuper Tuesdayâ€ � contest
, Rubio said : â€œSure .
Thatâ€ ™ s not the plan , by the way , but sure.â€
�
He then voiced anxieties that have coursed through the Republican party for months :
â€œI believe that a first - rate con artist is on the verge of taking over the party of Reagan and Lincoln.â€ � Calling the billionaire
â€œa clown actâ€ � who is â€œpreying onâ€
�
struggling Americans , Rubio warned that Trumpâ€ ™ s business record does not bear out his campaign promise to â€œmake America great againâ€ � .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to make America broke , like he did those four companies ,
â€ � Rubio joked bitterly .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to make it a casino.â€ �
The darkening mood even pervaded interviews with John Kasich , the Ohio governor whose strategy to win moderate Republican supports counts on his relentless and quixotic good cheer .
â€œI think Trumpâ€ ™ s probably going to win probably all of them , â€ � he told CNN of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primaries , which will dole out delegates to the candidates proportionally according to election results .
Trump leads polls in most Super Tuesday states , except Texas and Arkansas , where Cruz leads in some counts .
â€œOur campaign plan was ultimately to hold our own in some of these places , and we will , â€ � Kasich said .
He admitted , however , that should he lose in his home state , Ohio , on 15 March , a winner - take - all contest in a critical state ,
â€œitâ€ ™ s time to call it overâ€
� .
â€œYou
canâ€
™ t win your home state , you need to get out , â€ � he said .
Both Kasich and Rubio â€ “ who trails Trump in his Florida home â€ “ suggested their campaigns were ready for a brokered Republican convention in July , in order to keep the delegates
Trump needs out of his hands .
But that scenario would require a wholesale revolt against Trump by the Republican party , and the billionaire repeated hints that he is prepared to break his pledge not to run a third - party campaign .
â€œIf they have a problem , Iâ€ ™ m going to have a big problem with that , â€ � Trump said .
â€œIf they want to play that game , I can play it a lot better than they can.â€ �"
2016-03-01,"Donald Trump appears poised for sweeping victories on Super Tuesday that would effectively anoint him the Republicansâ€ ™ presumptive nominee , leaving the polarised conservative party in the throes of an existential crisis .
As Republican primaries or caucuses open in 12 states , the New York billionaire appears well placed to sweep them all save Texas , where Ted Cruz looks set to win on home turf .
On Monday one national CNN opinion poll of Republican voters put him at 49 % , more than all his opponents combined .
The dawning reality of Trump â€ “ an entrepreneur and reality TV show host who began the campaign viewed by many as something of a joke â€ “ as the party favourite has left senior Republicans scrambling to either destroy or jump aboard his populist bandwagon .
Although New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Alabama senator Jeff Sessions have endorsed him in recent days , many other governors and senators have remained silent or actively denounced him as unfit for the presidency or to take on Democrat Hillary Clinton .
Mitt Romney , the Republican nominee defeated in 2012 , has launched a series of attacks , while Nebraska senator Ben Sasse has raised the prospect of backing a third - party option .
With Trump having won three of four early primary contests , the panic was evident ahead of Super Tuesday , the biggest single - day delegate haul of the year .
His rivals sped from state to state in a frantic bid to prevent what many now regard as the inevitable outcome .
Marco Rubio , the party establishmentâ€ ™ s last best hope , attacked the frontrunner on everything from the now - defunct Trump University to the outsourcing of jobs to manufacture Trumpâ€ ™ s wide range of namesake products .
â€œIf he was interested in bringing back American jobs , he could start this very morning by announcing that every product that says Donald Trump on it will be made in America , â€ � Rubio said at a morning rally in Knoxville , Tennessee .
â€œI challenge him to do that.â€ �
At a subsequent event in Conway , Arkansas , Rubio turned to Trumpâ€ ™ s stance on immigration and his infamous promises to build a wall on the Mexican border .
Trump , who has made his tough approach to immigration the cornerstone of his campaign , has not always held such firm views on the issue , Rubio said , citing a report that the reality TV star privately expressed a much softer position to the New York Times .
Although the conversation with the Times editorial board was off the record , Rubio called on Trump to grant permission to the paper to release the audio of the interview â€œso
we can see exactly what it is he truly
believesâ€ � .
Romney also tweeted that Trump should authorize the New York Times to release the transcript , asking : â€œWhat is he hiding?â€ �
Interviewed on Fox News , Trump sought to dismiss the issue .
â€œI call it the failing New York Times ,
â€ � he said .
â€œIt is doing so badly , itâ€ ™ s dying .
We had a board meeting , it was off the record , all of a sudden they leak it , itâ€ ™ s all over the place.â€ �
On immigration , he went on :
â€œIt is negotiable ; things are negotiable , Iâ€ ™ ll be honest with you , Iâ€ ™ ll make the wall two feet shorter or something .
Everythingâ€ ™ s negotiable .
Building it ?
Not negotiable.â€ �
Rubio reiterated his criticism of Trump for failing to denounce the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and the KKK in an interview the day earlier , and then mocked Trumpâ€ ™ s claim that the incident was the result of a faulty earpiece .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t need a good earpiece to hear the words Ku Klux Klan , â€ �
Rubio said at an evening rally in Oklahoma City .
In what was his biggest applause line of the night , he added : â€œThere is no place for bigotry , for prejudice , for hatred , or for David Duke in the Republican party or conservative movement.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s aggressive posture toward Trump comes as the senator is looking to remain competitive in a race that has so far yielded no victories for his campaign .
With Trump poised for major success on Super Tuesday , Rubio is pinning his hopes on meeting the threshold to secure some delegates in each state , before going into the winner - take - all contests on 15 March â€ “ which include his home state of Florida .
Rubio was set to hold a rally in Miami as Tuesdayâ€ ™ s results pour in but , in a statement of intent , Trump was also due to spend the evening in Florida , at his Palm Beach resort .
The senatorâ€ ™ s new tack has nonetheless invited questions over his willingness to engage in low - brow humour , such as mocking Trumpâ€ ™ s face , tan and small hands , while seeking the nationâ€ ™ s highest office .
During an interview with Fox News on Monday evening , Rubio defended his campaign as focused primarily on substantive issues â€ “ while acknowledging the need to compete with Trump by beating him at his own game .
â€œDonald Trump has spent a year now insulting virtually everyone , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI mean very few groups or individuals in America that he hasnâ€ ™ t personally insulted .
Every now and then someone like that needs a taste of their own medicine.â€ �
Trump dismissed Rubio as a â€œlightweightâ€ � and said :
â€œHeâ€ ™ s very nasty
and I think heâ€
™ s very desperate.â€ � Texas senator Cruz â€œis
not exactly truthful
and I think
thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ m doing so well with the evangelicalsâ€ � , Trump added .
â€œThey like the truth.â€
�
In a packed auditorium on the campus of Houston Baptist University , Cruz , a conservative firebrand whom many in Washington view as even more distasteful than Trump , attacked the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s hiring of hundreds of foreign workers and saying on CNN that â€œAmericans arenâ€ ™ t qualified and arenâ€ ™ t willing to work as waiters and waitressesâ€ � .
The room was filled with audible gasps of disdain as Cruz railed against the frontrunner : â€œDonald Trump does not get to exploit immigration laws and take advantage of American workers and then pretend heâ€ ™ s going to be a champion for American workers.â€ �
Cruz continued to attack Trump being a closet liberal more than eager â€œto compromise away religious libertyâ€ � , adding : â€œIf youâ€ ™ re arguing about marginal tax rates you can reach a compromise on that , but when it comes to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution , weâ€ ™ ve had too many politicians who compromise our rights.â€ � Texas is the biggest prize on Super Tuesday and allocates 155 delegates .
Already a million people have voted absentee , including about 60 % of the room that Cruz spoke to on Monday night .
Cruz tried to play down expectations , making clear that while â€œwe will do well in the state of Texas , polling doesnâ€ ™ t suggest we are anywhere close to [ 50 % in the state]â€ � .
But Tuesday is also crunch time for the Republican party itself .
More delegates are at stake on Super Tuesday than on any other date on the primary calendar and a strong night for Trump could make his nomination almost inevitable .
Several high - profile figures have embraced an anti - Trump social media campaign , using the Twitter hashtag # NeverTrump .
An Associated Press survey of Republican senators and governors asked if they would support Trump if he secured the nomination .
Just under half of those who responded would not commit to backing him .
On Sunday , Sasse , the first senator to pledge openly not to support Trump in a general election , urged Republicans to consider whether a party led by him would still represent their interests .
â€œIf our party
is no longer working for the things we believe in , like defending the sanctity of life , stopping Obamacare , protecting the Second Amendment , etc .
then people of good conscience should stop supporting that party until it is reformed , â€ � he wrote on Facebook .
Despite the controversies swirling around him , Trumpâ€ ™ s momentum appeared unstoppable on Monday .
Thousands queued in Valdosta , Georgia , for a glimpse of the candidate , who described himself as â€œjust the messengerâ€ � of a social movement .
â€œMy whole life has been money ,
â€ � he declared .
â€œI want money , I want money .
Greed .
I was greedy , I want more money , more money .
Now they come up , â€˜Donald , Iâ€ ™
d like to give you $ 10 m for your campaign.â€ ™
I go : â€˜I donâ€
™ t want it.â€ ™ â€œItâ€ ™ s hard , because my whole life , I take money , take money .
Now , Iâ€ ™ m going to be greedy for the United States .
Iâ€ ™ m going to take and take and take.â€
�
At that the crowd erupted in prolonged cheers , whistles and chants of â€œUSA !
USA!â€ �
Sensing he had struck a chord , Trump went on : â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to take , take , take , take .
Weâ€ ™ re going to become rich again and then weâ€ ™ re going to be great again
â€
¦
We canâ€
™ t be great unless weâ€ ™ re going to make ourselves rich again.â€ �
Spectator Terry Bradman , 37 , an industrial salesman , said it was the biggest event in Valdosta in his lifetime .
â€œWe need to support somebody who is going to support America , â€ � he explained .
â€œTrump says whatâ€ ™ s on his mind .
He doesnâ€
™ t do political bullshit .
He says what the American people have been thinking for years .
Everybodyâ€ ™ s tired of the Washington politics.â€
�
John Lee , 47 , who runs a small business selling â€œChristian clothesâ€ � , was wearing a T - shirt emblazoned with the second amendment .
â€œWe want to see the Donald , â€ � he says .
â€œHe has common sense .
He doesnâ€ ™ t put up with wish - wash ;
heâ€
™ s not your standard politician .
He stands up for principle and takes care of his people.â€ �"
2016-03-01,"Super Tuesday is over â€ “ notwithstanding a lot of delegate math left to be done and that tardy Alaska caucuses result ( with 22.2 % reporting , Donald Trump leads Ted Cruz 35.9%-33.1 % ) .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned : Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee ... yet .
Nevertheless , it was a big night for the New York billionaire , and for Hillary Clinton .
They won seven states each , picked up armloads of delegates and advanced their respective claims on their partiesâ€ ™ presidential nominations .
Itâ€ ™ s not over yet â€ “ on the Democratic side , Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ s
four state victories keep the race alive , and on the Republican side Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s big win in Texas and second win in Oklahoma do the same .
Florida senator Marco Rubio had a tough night .
He won only one state - Minnesota â€ “ and fell short of the 20 % minimum needed to earn delegates in Texas , Alabama and Vermont .
He appeared to fall 100 + delegates behind Cruz .
Rubio vowed to fight on , telling supporters the race was in its early stages and he would start to clean up later this month .
Our comprehensive results page is here .
( This isnâ€ ™ t something we learned tonight but
this seems like a good place to mention it . )
Clinton profited from giant 60- to 80-point margins among African American voters across the South .
What about Ben Carson and John Kasich ?
Kasich came in second in Vermont .
Carson was in contention nowhere .
Kasich called on Rubio to drop out and Carson said : â€œI will remain.â€ �
The races could resolve dramatically in the next two weeks .
Nine states host contests between now and 15 March , when the contests suddenly become winner - take - all and crucial states vote including Florida , Ohio and North Carolina .
As for color , there was a strange Trump victory - rally - slash - press - conference that ran interminably .
What made it strange was New Jersey governor Chris Christie , who endorsed Trump last Friday , introduced Trump and then stood behind him the whole time .
But the look on Christieâ€ ™ s face was one of doom .
The internet noticed .
Just after the polls closed in Alaska , Sam Moore , 31 , arrived at the Lofts hotel in Anchorage where a small group of Republicans were gathering to watch results come in .
He was holding a Marco Rubio sign .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a marathon not a sprint
, I think he still has a chance , â€ � he said .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t let Trump win the nomination.â€
�
In the bar , Cary Taylor , 47 , and friends watched national news reporting big wins for Trump .
Alaskaâ€ ™ s poll results were still hours away , but many expected a similar result .
Taylor supports Trump , he said , because he feels he can â€œbring back common sense to American government.â€
�
He feels good about Trumpâ€ ™ s progress .
â€œWhat Iâ€ ™ m seeing in America is someone who , love â€˜em or hate â€˜em , at least has actually performed in the market , has actually proven himself.â€
�
The results so far ( 10 % in ) show Trump ahead in Alaska with 34.2 % of the vote .
The big takeaway from tonight ?
A presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump looks even more likely , writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi : Thatâ€ ™ s because both candidates finished Super Tuesday by making big gains in their delegate count numbers .
Final delegate numbers are still being calculated but at the time of writing , Clinton added 436 delegates to her running total ( putting her at 527 delegates compared to Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ 325 ) and Trump gained an extra 186 delegates ( giving him a total of 268 so far compared to Cruzâ€ ™ s 142 ) .
Even though delegates are what really matters ( and those are often dependent on vote share )
the simple fact of coming first can matter too .
Just ask Bernie Sanders - the Senator won in four states even though some expectations had him winning only Vermont , his home state .
Although he still has an uphill struggle to get the 2,382 delegates needed to become the Democratic nominee , Sanders might now be perceived as more of a viable candidate among voters .
The race goes on .
Rubio appears to have fallen short in key 20 % cutoff states ...
While Cruz appears to have sewn up Texas .
That would account for part of the 100-some delegate split that appears to have emerged between them .
Sanders beat Clinton in Oklahoma â€ “ where the former secretary state defeated Barack Obama in the 2008 primary .
Sheâ€ ™ s getting worse at Oklahoma , it appears : Howâ€ ™ s the overall delegate haul this evening shaking out ?
Cook Political report seesTrump with at least 262 total , of the 1,237 needed to win the nomination , and the AP sees Trump with at least 257 .
Cook sees a big gap opening between Cruz and Rubio ...
While the Associated Press counts a significant haul for Trump this Super Tuesday and a lesser haul for Cruz : With results still coming in , Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday delegates , while Cruz picked up at least 52 .
Overall , Trump led with 257 delegates , Cruz 106 , Rubio 67 .
It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president .
On the Democratic side , Clinton was assured of winning at least 441 of the 865 delegates at stake on Super Tuesday .
Sanders was sure to get at least 262 .
Including superdelegates , Clinton had at least 989 delegates .
Sanders had at least 349 .
It takes 2,383 Democratic delegates to win .
Clinton has won at least 10 states since the nomination contests began , with Sanders victorious in at least five .
Among Democrats , Trump has won at least nine states , with three for Cruz and one for Rubio .
Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts has been following the Bernie Sanders campaign since May and has clocked some 60 campaign events : Carson , whom voters in most states have just resoundingly counted out , has released a statement to supporters saying : â€œI am not moved or discouraged when the political class count me outâ€
�
: As long we continue to receive their support , and the Lord keeps opening doors , I will remain in this presidential race .
The stakes are too high to willingly hand our country over once again to the pundits and the political class .
I truly believe in America and the potential to return to the values on which this country was founded .
Ouch .
Of Alabamaâ€ ™ s 50 delegates , 26 are statewide and 21 are awarded per congressional district ( the remaining three are free - floating ) .
Florida senator Marco Rubio may still clear the 20 % threshold within a congressional district to access some delegates in Alabama .
But heâ€ ™ s fallen short of 20 % statewide : A rundown of Rubioâ€ ™ s war on 20 % elsewhere : Make that seven states for Trump , with only Alaska outstanding .
If Trump wins Alaska , the win tally for the evening would be Trump 8 , Cruz 2 and Rubio 1 .
Alaska hosted Republican caucuses tonight and has 28 delegates to offer with a 13 % threshold to qualify for delegates .
Weâ€ ™ ll see if we get a quick call right at midnight ET .
Newt Gingrich agrees ( and no surprise here ? ) with the blog : Trumpâ€ ™ s news conference struck a notable â€ “ and favorable , from where we sit â€ “ contrast with the run - of - the - mill rah - rah rallies of the other candidates tonight : ( h / t : @bencjacobs )
As CNN called the Minnesota caucuses for Bernie Sanders at 10.30pm local time , the right - side room of The Local in downtown Minneapolis erupted in cheers and chants of â€œBernie !
Bernie!â€ � , as staff , supporters and volunteers raised their arms and clinked their glasses .
Phil Khalar - Gibson , who spent the weekend criss - crossing Minneapolis educating people about the caucus process and handing out Sanders literature arrived exuberantly just moments before the call .
â€œMy precinct was crazy!â€ �
he shouted , pulling out sheets of numbers showing overwhelming caucus tallies in Sandersâ€ ™ favor .
Ryan Flanders , who campaigned and caucused for Obama in 2008 and voted for Green party candidate Jill Stein in 2012 , said his personal circumstances hadnâ€ ™ t allowed him to volunteer for Sanders despite his excitement , but that he showed up early at his caucus to help sign potential caucus goers in .
â€œI want them to be able to have their voices
heardâ€ � , he said .
And , if the results are any indication , many new caucus - goersâ€ ™ voices were definitely heard .
First - time caucus goer and life - long Minnesota resident
Simon Hardy said : â€œThis is probably the first candidate Iâ€ ™ ve really felt inspired by.â€
�
His friend , Andrew Henley - who also caucused for the first time tonight - said he turned out for Sanders because â€œI saw a glimmer of what could be possible for my great - grandchildren , and felt a responsibility to participate beyond my personal motivation.â€ �
Hardy plans to vote Democratic no matter who wins the partyâ€ ™ s primaries :
â€œThe thought of a FÃ¼hrer Trump terrifies me , â€ � he said .
Weird times at the official Arkansas Republican Party party at the Embassy Suites on â€
”
and this is really gilding the lily â€ ” Financial Services Drive in west Little Rock .
This has been a great night for the Arkansas Republican Party .
Voter participation in the state has broken roughly 60 - 40 in their favor , marking easily the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans have voted in greater numbers than Democrats in these contests .
But the official state GOP party is the only party in town not run by Democrats .
The Clinton people are whooping it up in the same way that a Division 5A high school whoops it up after beating a Division 1A team by 72 points at the homecoming game .
The Sanders people are at a local brewery near the riverwalk .
They deserve it .
But as for the Republicans , no one â€ ” not Cruz , not Rubio , not Trump â€ ” had an actual official office here , the party planning , as does so many things with conservatism , devolves to the state .
The state GOP party isnâ€ ™ t in danger of going off the rails .
It is glued to the rails .
It is welded and nail - gunned to the rails .
Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson speaks , then finishes to a scatter of applause .
For people having a historic night , there are no whoops , whistles or even a vaguely Stone Cold Steve Austin - esque HELL YEAH .
If you werenâ€ ™ t paying attention to his speech , you might not have noticed it ended .
There is a faintly funereal sense to his appearance .
The governor has lost something close to him , and it is political capital .
Hutchinson broke from state party tradition and endorsed Rubio before the primary , and several state party leaders followed him .
Perhaps that decision owed more to the primary being held unusually early , but all anyone will read into the act is another breached barricade in the stop Trump movement .
The screens with Fox News at the rear of the Embassy Suites restaurant â€ ” and the variegated Fox , CNN , MSNBC feeds on the screens on the right side â€ ” all show the same thing .
Donald Trump is walking away with the party , and as soon as the results come in from here , itâ€ ™ s going to turn out he walked away with Arkansas too .
Five states tonight deny delegates to any candidate who does not get at least 20 % of the vote .
Marco Rubio has hung right at the 20 % mark in all five .
Ending up just below the mark could make Rubioâ€ ™ s night significantly worse , in terms of picking up delegates ( which is all that matters ) .
Heâ€ ™ s looking good in Georgia .
In Alabama and in Texas , the big delegate prize â€
“ not so much .
Hereâ€ ™ s how Rubio stands currently in the five states in question : Alabama : 18.3 % with 79.3 % reporting .
Georgia : 23.8 % with 87.9 % reporting .
Tennessee : 20.8 % with 95.1 % reporting .
Texas : 17.3 % with 52.2 % reporting .
Vermont : 19.4 % with 82.9 % reporting .
Bernie Sanders scored a critical Super Tuesday victory against Hillary Clinton in Colorado , sparking celebrations across the liberal city of Denver as the Vermont senator struggled with significant losses in other states across the country .
Emily Rosa , a 23-year - old Denver voter - carrying a sign that read â€œBernie : Championing LGBT rights before it was coolâ€ � - said it was exciting to see a female presidential candidate winning throughout the US , but noted that Sandersâ€ ™ momentum felt more historic to her .
â€œItâ€
™ s really awesome that a woman is doing so well , but at the same time , what Sanders is doing is really this grassroots movement
, â€ � said Rosa , an art director at a design firm .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s getting so many people out in the younger generation and thatâ€ ™ s
so cool.â€
�
She added : â€œHeâ€ ™ s showing that a politician can get this far without all that campaign money , and that message is really important and a historic one ...
I feel like Iâ€ ™ m contributing to something bigger than myself.â€ �
Rosa was one of many pro - Sanders voters who crowded into a middle school cafeteria in Denver at a caucus that appeared to attract fewer Clinton supporters and dragged on for hours as organizers slowly signed in a bottleneck of registered Democrats .
Some elderly voters sat on the floor of the school cafeteria and gym , complaining that there were not enough chairs for those who needed them .
Colorado was a key battleground for Sanders after he failed to gain traction in South Carolina last month and lost other important southern states on Super Tuesday .
Colorado has a large bloc of independent voters who are unaffiliated with either political party , and the Sanders campaign has worked on the ground to register new Democrats .
Dan Patrick , the lieutenant governor of Texas and active Cruz surrogate , told reporters that he thought Thursdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate was a pivotal moment for voters .
â€œTwo of the candidates on stage looked like they were auditioning to be gameshow hosts and
the third looked presidential.â€
�
He thought voters would coalesce around Ted Cruz because â€œthey want to be with winnersâ€ � .
Patrick argued that Marco Rubio should drop out after his poor night , â€œthe question the media should ask Marco Rubio is : why are you staying in this race after tonight?â€ � Letâ€ ™ s check in on Vermont , aka the Republican nailbiterâ„¢. Vermont represents the smallest pot of delegates for Republicans tonight with only 16 to give .
But a win there for John Kasich , who is currently running just behind Trump , would carry bragging rights beyond delegate weight .
With 81.8 % reporting , Trump stands at 32.4 % , Kasich stands at 30.7 % and Rubio stands at 19.4 % .
Visit our comprehensive results page to stay abreast of all the latest returns : The delegate split should be narrow , given the closeness of the Democratic race in Massachusetts .
But Clinton can claim her seventh and final win of the night â€ “ a fine Super Tuesday performance that does not cinch the nomination but that positions her well to do so .
Have you ever made a decision you regret ?
But had to stand by it ?
Chris Christie has !
He decided to endorse Donald Trump .
And now heâ€ ™ s stuck having to stand behind him while he talks about all the things Donald Trump talks about .
Building walls .
Marco Rubio being sweaty .
Mexicans .
Etc .
For most of us , that that internal thought of : â€œWhat on godâ€ ™ s earth have I done?â€ � might be limited to ordering a terrible beer , knowing you have to drink the whole pint , or discussing politics with some evangelical Christians , or accidentally killing a cat you were supposed to be looking after .
But unfortunately for Christie , his betraying facial expressions were made in public .
And instantly became a thing among people on the internet .
If that wasnâ€ ™ t bad enough , six New Jersey newspapers have called on Christie to resign since he agreed to become Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s stooge .
In a joint editorial , newspapers including the Ashbury Park Press and the Cherry Hill Courier - Post said the governor should resign because â€œweâ€ ™ re fed up with Gov. Chris Christieâ€ ™ s
arroganceâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re fed up with his opportunism .
Weâ€ ™ re fed up with his hypocrisy , â€ � the papers wrote in a joint editorial .
The AP projects a fourth win for Sanders .
Thatâ€ ™ s six so far tonight for Clinton , four for Sanders .
And Massachusetts , where Clinton holds a slim lead , is still out .
( Clinton won American Samoa too . )
Amid an otherwise disappointing night , Marco Rubio scored big in Minnesota , where he has now been projected to win the caucuses .
Itâ€ ™ s
Rubioâ€ ™ s first win of the 2016 race .
Minnesota will award its 38 delegates proportionally with a 10 % threshold .
With 53 % reporting , the race stood at Rubio with 37.3 % , Trump with 28 % and Trump at 21.1 % .
Minnesota is also the first state in which Trump failed to place either first or second .
Thatâ€ ™ s three for Sanders â€ “ Colorado , Oklahoma and Vermont .
Massachusetts and Minnesota have yet to be called on the Democratic side .
Minnesota and Vermont are the late trains on the Republican side .
And of course thereâ€ ™ s the Republican voting in Alaska , where polls donâ€ ™ t close until 12 am ET .
Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs flags some non - presidential - election news from this voting night : Texas Representative Kevin Brady , the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means committee , is facing a Tea Party primay challenge â€ “ and is currently under 50 % .
If he doesnâ€ ™ t crack that mark , it goes to a runoff and that would become the next huge scalp for right wingers to try to claim .
Democratic Florida Representative Alan Grayson , a Sanders backer and Senate candidate , suggests that Trump capitalized in the South on support from the Ku Klux Klan , which Trump disavowed repeatedly tonight .
( h / t : @bencjacobs )
At a community center turned caucus site on the south side of the predominately African American neighborhood of North Minneapolis , there was already a line to vote at 6.35pm local time .
But while some voters cast their blue paper ballots and left , others took seats ( and then overflow seats ) to vote for individual delegates and local resolutions .
Shoshana Daniels , a volunteer with Neighborhoods Organizing for Change , got here early to talk to her fellow caucus - goers about the resolutions designed by NOC that she planned to proposed ( one for educational justice and another to restore voting rights to felons released on parole or probation ) .
The resolutions process is designed to help the Democratic - Farmer - Labor party , the local version of the Democratic party , determine on which issues to focus during the election season .
It is Danielsâ€ ™ s first caucus , although she is 33 and was born and raised in Minnesota .
â€œIâ€ ™ m interested enough in supporting Bernie Sanders that I wouldâ€ ™ ve come to a primary , but I heard about the resolution process and decided to caucus , â€ � she said .
Local issues , she said â€œare high stakes for me , because I plan to live here , because I will have black children here , because I brought a black partner here.â€
�
But though the caucus site is in a predominantly African American neighborhood , the caucus goers were overwhelmingly white - likely , Danielsâ€ ™ said , a result of the precinctâ€ ™ s proximity to a historically white neighborhood and gentrification moving north .
Still , the white convener ( or precinct captain ) wore a Black Lives Matter T - shirt and reiterated the DFLâ€ ™ s commitment to racial inclusion and encouraged people to vote in favor of delegates and precinct officials that represent the partyâ€ ™ s inclusive values .
How is the Republican establishment handling tonightâ€ ™ s result ?
Itâ€ ™ s been a good night for home state wins â€

You can see all the live updates , county - by - county in our one - stop shop for Super Tuesday results : Carson blames the system .
Rubio still swinging on TV : With 10.3 % reporting in Minnesota , itâ€ ™ s Rubio ( 36.9 % ) , Cruz ( 27.4 % ) and Trump ( 20.4 % ) .
Here in downtown Minneapolis , Bernie Sanders supporters had , apparently , planned to gather to celebrate his victory at an Irish - style pub ( featuring , for some reason , carved iguana statues ) to celebrate his likely win .
But for the first hour after voting ended - while , in each precinct , two on - the - spot volunteers were painstakingly counting paper ballots -
the only Sanders supporter in sight was one morose regular in the corner of the bar , who cracked several loud , sexist jokes about Hillary Clinton while staring at your humble correspondent .
He left before the Democratic caucus results began to roll in .
Republican candidate Jim Gilmore , the former governor of Virginia , somehow won the precinct of Chelsea , Massachusetts , across the river north of Boston , with 366 votes .
Take that , Trump .
How ?
Zero Gravity , a local brewery in Vermont , sold 300 cases of their signature Bernie Weisse beer today , writes Lois Beckett in Essex Junction .
Thatâ€ ™ s 7,200 cans of â€œa slightly sour and forward - thinking aleâ€ � .
There was a one case per person limit , bartender Emma Shea told me .
They went on sale at noon , and sold out in about five hours , she said .
While the brewery is out of cans of Bernie Weisse , theyâ€ ™ re still selling the ale on tap , she said .
Can Rubio score a victory in balmy Minnesota ?
Minnesota , which caucuses , has 38 delegates to offer , with a 10 % threshold to win any delegates .
Thatâ€ ™ s six for Trump .
The unresolved Republican races where polls have closed are Vermont and Minnesota .
Cruz begins with an ultra - slow narration of next January .
President Obama will leave office .
It will be his last day .
Then we will have a new president .
Then the new president will take office .
â€œThe voters have spoken , â€ � Cruz says .
Then he jumps into his argument that everyone else should drop out so he can take on Trump :
So long as the field remains divided , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s
path to the nomination remains more likely , and that would be a disaster for Republicans , for conservatives and for the nation ...
And after tonight , we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten , that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump .
We are the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump once .
Twice .
Three times .
Itâ€ ™ s a happy crowd in Houston .
â€œThank
you , Texas!â€ � Cruz begins .
Ben Jacobs is in the house : Watch Ted Cruzâ€
™ s speech live here : This is an ambitious line of messaging from the Kasich campaign : â€œTonight
I can say that we have absolutely exceeded expectations , â€ �
Ohio governor John Kasich told supporters in Jackson , Mississippi , tonight .
â€œWe are running right now neck and neck with Donald Trump in the state of Vermont , â€ �
he said .
With 60 % of the vote , Trump has 32.7 % of the vote and Kasich 30.8 % .
â€œAnd thatâ€ ™ s not exactly my home , OK , Vermont .
We love Vermont , â€ �
he added in a Trump - ish touch , â€œbut
itâ€
™ s a ways away.â€ � Kasich - a moderate in
this Republican race - added that he and Marco Rubio were â€œbasically tied for secondâ€ � in Massachusetts .
He said he would have â€œhome court advantageâ€ � in Mississippi and Michigan next Tuesday .
â€œAnd then Iâ€ ™ m going to tell you now we will beat Donald Trump in the state of Ohio , â€ � he vowed .
Ohio votes on 15 March .
The Colorado caucus in one Denver middle school was packed and chaotic as hundreds of voters filed in - most with Bernie Sanders stickers and T - shirts .
Kathy Mannion , 57 , and Shelley Reed , also 57 , were two of the only visible Hillary Clinton supporters in the crowd .
They retreated to a corner waiting for the process to begin .
The women joked that they were afraid to talk to a reporter and wear their Clinton stickers among such a pro - Sanders crowd .
â€œShe just has a better chance of winning and is a more realistic candidate , â€ � said Mannion .
â€œI like Bernie Sanders , but I donâ€
™ t think heâ€ ™ ll be able to pull it off ...
Iâ€ ™ m scared of Trump on the other side.â€ � Reed added : â€œI just hope cooler heads prevail .
I hope we donâ€
™ t get caught in the celebrity of all this .
Itâ€ ™ s a race for president , not student president.â€

Ashley Adams , a 31-year - old avid Sanders fan , said she was thrilled to see the turnout for the Vermont senator , but was worried to hear that Clinton was doing so well elsewhere in the country .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been struggling with health issues and the health care system is honestly so
fâ€ ™ d up , â€ � she said .
â€œWe really need the changes Bernie has promised .
My future and our future here depends on it.â€ �
She continued : â€œIâ€ ™ m really sad to hear Clinton is winning .
Itâ€ ™ s a bummer .
People really need to open their eyes.â€ �
At Yearbook Taco Bar in Charlottesville , Virginia , a crowd of students from the University of Virginiaâ€ ™ s business school were gathered around the bar watching election results roll in .
And the consensus , as Donald Trump continued to climb in the polls , seemed to be that a Trump win in their state was something of an embarrassment .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to make us look so stupid , â€ � mourned a skinny first - year with glasses .
â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s a buffoon , â€ � replied his friend .
â€œYeah ,
â€ � agreed the one in glasses .
â€œA buffoon whoâ€ ™ s going to win everywhere.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s often said that Virginia is a bellwether state , and whether that proves true this election , 1 March victories by Trump and Hillary Clinton in Virginia speak to the candidatesâ€ ™ strength in a crucial swing state .
With the GOP anti - establishment vote split between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump , Marco Rubio had a strong performance in the state as he performed well in wealthy communities to the north such as Fairfax county .
Ultimately though he was no match for Trump .
Cruz , who announced his run for president at Liberty University in Lynchburg last year , had hoped to shore up the stateâ€ ™ s evangelical vote , but despite repeatedly mentioning his faith and anti - abortion politics on the trail , he was not able to move past Trump , who beat out Cruz with evangelical voters in South Carolina last week and even attracted the personal endorsement of Liberty University president Jerry Falwell .
On the Democratic side , Virginia has long been considered to be Clinton country , with the former first lady attracting the support of practically every prominent state leader from Governor Terry McAuliffe on down .
And on Tuesday those high level endorsements and campaign trail surrogates appeared to pay off , as Clinton easily bested Bernie Sanders .
With five big wins and the results still rolling in , Hillary Clinton took the stage at her party in Miami , Florida , a short time ago , Lauren Gambino reports .
A confident but hoarse Clinton reiterated her for more â€œlive and kindnessâ€ � , positioning herself in stark contrast to Donald Trump .
Clinton congratulated her opponent , Bernie Sanders , on a strong showing .
She did not mention or even refer to him again , taking aim only at Republicans in a sign of her growing confidence that she has secured a path to the nomination .
In her speech , she emphasized the many ways she planned to â€œbreak down barriersâ€ � for disenfranchised Americans .
She promised to protect all human rights : â€œworkers rights , womenâ€ ™ s rights , citing rights , LGBT rights , civil rightsâ€ � .
As she spoke , the Associated Press projected that she had won Texas .
Clinton is expected to carry the momentum sheâ€ ™ s built across the US on Super Tuesday into other states holding contests in the next couple weeks .
Clinton told reporters earlier on Tuesday that the sooner the nomination process was wrapped up , presuming she wins , the sooner she could focus her fire at Republicans .
( Sheâ€ ™ s anti . )

Ben Jacobs is in Houston waiting for Ted Cruz , who is waiting for Donald Trump to clam it .
Trump is asked whether Rubio should drop out if he loses Florida .
â€œI always liked Marco till about a week ago , when he decided to become hostile .

At least Ted has won something.â€ �
Trump is asked about failing on CNN to disavow the support of former KKK leader David Duke .
â€œI disavowed , â€ �
Trump says .
Then he digresses : â€œChris is my number one .
Chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign .
We spoke today in Kentucky ... and it was incredible .
And every place that weâ€ ™ re speaking ... we had 35,000 people the other day in Alabama .
And Iâ€ ™ m just honored by it .
When Chris joined , we had a news conference , and they asked me the exact same question , and I disavowed .
I totally disavow .
Now everybody knew I did that . ..
I mean how many times you supposed to disavow .
Now I disavow , and hopefully itâ€ ™ s the last time I have to do it .
Trumpâ€ ™
s asked whether he really believes in his policy proposals on issues such as immigration , or whether he just sees them as initial offers in a negotiations process .
No itâ€ ™ s not , but there is going to always be some negotiation .
But itâ€ ™ s going to be a good negotiation , not a bad negotiation.â€ �
Is immigration negotiable ?
We are going to have a wall , I can tell you.â€ �
Trump takes a question about Planned Parenthood and decides to answer it .
What a contrast from every candidate to speak .
Instead of repeating his stump speech he holds a news conference .
He says Planned Parenthood does some good work , although he has promised to defund it .
Then this : I am going to be really good for women
Then Trump is asked whether he feels like the presumptive nominee .
â€œI feel awfully good .
Iâ€ ™ m watching your peopleâ€ � he says of the media , and they are â€œbeing very nice to me
tonight.â€ � Theyâ€ ™ re declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of tonight , and theyâ€ ™ re right , because he hasnâ€ ™ t won anything .
Trump takes questions .
Every appearance is a news conference in the Trump presidency candidacy .
The first one is about Nebraska senator Ben Sasse and other Republicans who say they would not support Trump were he the nominee .
â€œLet me just explain something .
If youâ€ ™ ve seen whatâ€ ™ s happened ...
South Carolina , Nevada ...
tonight is the best of all , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œWe have expanded the Republican party ...

Weâ€ ™ ve actually expanded the party ...
I am a unifier .
Once we get all of this finished , Iâ€ ™ m going to go after one person , and thatâ€ ™ s Hillary Clinton .

The Guardianâ€ ™ s David Smith is in the room : The news that Trump and Clinton have triumphed in Tennessee has been met with a tepid response in downtown Nashville .
There are no celebrations in the slew of country music bars that line Broadway .
There was some boisterous cheering on the street just after the polls closed at 7 pm , but it was from ice hockey fans .
( The Nashville Predators are playing the Dallas Stars tonight . )
In Roberts Western World , a popular honky tonk bar where the drummer of a band recently fell out of a window , literally no one wanted to talk about the election .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re on vacation , â€ � said one man .
Iâ€ ™ m currently sitting behind him .
He is wearing his jeans very low , revealing his buttocks .
Earlier , I was across the road in Honky Tonk Central â€ “ according to the Yelp reviews it is rubbish
â€ “ and people were more forthcoming .
â€œI voted for Cruz , â€ � said Josh Chadwick , 30 .
â€œCruz is a hard ass and he doesnâ€ ™ t take shit from anybody.â€ �
Chadwick is from Texas and had voted early in his home state .
He was in Nashville on business , he said .
He also likes Carson and has given money to the retired surgeonâ€ ™ s campaign .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not a politician , Chadwick said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s
extremely smart , heâ€ ™ s a big Christian , and I completely agree with his tax plan .
In my tax bracket that would be a big drop .
I work damn hard for my money
and I want to spend it how I want to spend it , not give it to someone else.â€
�
Chadwick was accompanied by his colleague , Jenny .
She did not want to give her last name .
â€œHahahaha , â€ �
she said , or laughed , when I asked how she felt about Trumpâ€ ™ s victory .
â€œIâ€ ™ m laughing at Donald Trump , â€ � Jenny said .
â€œI think heâ€ ™ s a joke .
Heâ€ ™ s off - balance , a crazy person thatâ€ ™ s talking about stuff
thatâ€ ™ s not gon na happen.â€ �
Jenny said she had not voted for Trump .
Mother and daughter Cathy and Amanda Leitz were seated further along the bar .
They were on a road trip to Peoria , Illinois , where Amanda , 23 , was moving to be with her boyfriend .
They had passed through New Orleans , Atlanta and Chattanooga so far .
They liked New Orleans the best .
â€œI like John Kasich , he looks like he could speak to both sides , â€ � said Cathy , a property manager .
She lives in Virginia .
I asked if she had considered voting for Jim Gilmore , a favorite candidate of this blog .
Or at least mine .
â€œNo .
I think his time has gone , â€ �
she said .
Amanda said she likes Ted Cruz .
â€œI donâ€

â€œIf it comes down to Trump and Hillary itâ€

Obviously he runs his business well , but how does he treat his employees?â€ � Amanda said .
â€œBecause we would be his employees.â€ �
A sobering thought .
Chris Christie is warming up the Trump crowd .
â€œTonight is the beginning of Donald Trump bringing the Republican party together for a big victory this November .
Tonight is the beginning of Donald Trump bringing our nation together to make America win again .
Christie says that the party must brace for the fight in the fall to â€œmake sure Hillary Rodham Clinton never gets back to the White House .
He says Trump has run â€œnot a campaign , itâ€ ™ s a movement.â€ � Watch Chris Christie and Donald Trump speak live here : Marco Rubio struck a defiant tone tonight despite a dismal showing in which the senator failed to rack up a single win - and appeared short of the 20 % threshold in certain states to secure any delegates .
Speaking in his hometown of Miami , Rubio declared it would be up to Florida to shift the direction of the race when that state votes on 15 March .
â€œTwo weeks from tonight , right here in Florida , we are going to send a message loud and clear , â€ �
Rubio said before thousands at an equestrian center in the Miami suburbs .
â€œWe are going to send a message that the party of Lincoln and Reagan and the presidency of the United States will never be held by a con artist.â€ �
With his family by his side , Rubio reiterated some of the lines in Spanish - prompting deafening cheers from the majority - Hispanic crowd .
While acknowledging there was â€œa lot of work to be done , â€ � Rubio put on a brave face while insisting his numbers were on the rise while Trumpâ€ ™ s were in decline .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s at stake is not just the future of America but also the future of the conservative movement , â€ � he said of the Republican frontrunner .
â€œDo not give into the fear .
Do not give into the sham artists and con artists who try to take advantage of your suffering.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s aides remain bullish about their prospects in Florida , where the senator is trailing Trump by double digits .
Staffers working on the ground in Florida said their own numbers had Rubio inching up on the reality TV star .
Rubio himself said he was going nowhere , despite the increasingly uphill battle ahead .
â€œI will campaign as long as it takes â€ ¦ to ensure that Iâ€ ™ m the next president of the United States , â€ � he said .
Taking a gander at our lively and entertaining results page , we see that the race between the Democrats in Massachusetts remains tight , with 36.4 % reporting .
Clinton currently sits at 52 % , with Sanders at 46.8 % .
Looking like a very difficult night for Rubio , if he doesnâ€ ™ t start creeping above 20 % in those states where he needs to to score any delegates at all â€ “ Alabama , Tennessee , Vermont and Texas ...
But kind of a nice night for Ted Cruz , who will be making a strong argument that everyone else should clear the race :
Cruz winning Oklahoma is a considerable upset for pollsters .
Real Clear Politicsâ€ ™ polling averages put Cruz in third place , a full 12 percentage points behind Trump and the electoral predictions site FiveThirtyEight thought that Cruz had a mere 11 % chance of winning the state .
Marco Rubio is striving to project optimism about the contests ahead .
But he hasnâ€ ™ t had any breaks so far â€ “ no win in Virginia
or , it appears , Minnesota ; [ may have spoken too soon about Minnesota ]
no Cruz loss in Texas ; and his own struggle to clear 20 % in Texas and get a share of those 155 delegates .
P.S. :
Rubio is behind Trump by 20 points in polling averages of the Florida GOP contest .
Per AP .
Thatâ€ ™ s two for Cruz , five so far for Trump â€ “ and zero for Rubio .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Sabrina Siddiqui is in the hall in Miami , where Marco Rubio - who has failed to win any states this evening so far - has been addressing supporters : â€œIt is great to be home , â€ � he says , before turning to the subject of Donald Trump :
We are saying in state after state â€ ¦ his numbers coming down , our numbers going up ...
Two weeks from tonight , right here in Florida , we are going to send a message loud and clear .
Whatâ€ ™ s at stake is not just the future of America but also the future of the conservative movement .
The margin in Texas , which has 251 delegates to award on the Democratic side and 155 delegates to give on the GOP side , is not clear â€ “ but the power of the result for home state senator Ted Cruz is unmistakable .
He had as much as called Texas a must - win today â€ “
and tonight he delivered .
Texas is also a state where Republican candidates must clear 20 % , both statewide and within congressional districts , to collect any delegates at all .
Whereâ€ ™ s Rubio ?
With 1.6 % reporting , Cruz has 39.1 % , Trump has 28.2 % and Rubio has ... 19.5 % .
Hereâ€ ™ s
Cook Political Report editor Dave Wasserman :
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs is in Houston : Lots of readers have been expressing shock at Trump cleaning up with 46.5 % of votes in Massachusetts .
Itâ€ ™ s true that on the face of it , this state looks different to Trumpâ€ ™ s typical white working class support base : median household income in Massachusetts is $ 69.2k ( considerably higher than the national median of $ 53.6k ) and 41 % of voters have a bachelorâ€ ™ s degree or higher .
But a more detailed map from the Boston Globe shows that this is a varied state with many households earning much less than the median .
Itâ€ ™ s also possible that what we assume about Trumpâ€ ™ s support base ( assumptions grounded in shaky polling ) is inaccurate and that the candidate has been able to reach out to wealthier Americans .
Immediately as polls close .
Many Rubio supporters are already pointing fingers at Ohio governor John Kasich for the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s closer than expected loss to Donald Trump in the Virginia primary , writes Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs : In their reasoning , if every Kasich voter had just supported Rubio , he would have won .
But aside from that specious logic , Virginiaâ€ ™ s primary is entirely proportional .
Unlike most other Super Tuesday states holding Republican primaries , there are no thresholds for candidate to win delegates .
This means all five candidates on the ballot , including Ben Carson , will net delegates from the Old Dominion .
However , if Rubio falls short of the 20 % threshold in states like Alabama or Texas , then he can blame Kasich supporters .
But , in Virginia , Rubio hasnâ€ ™ t lost a single delegate .
Heâ€
™ s just lost some bragging rights .
Clinton is in Miami .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got work to do , â€ �
she tells supportesr .
â€œBut that work is not to make America great again .
America never stopped being great.â€ �
â€œWhat a Super Tuesday!â€ � she begins .
She says â€œDemocrats voted to break down barriers so we can all rise together.â€
�
She congratulates Sanders â€œon his strong showing.â€
�
Thanks her volunteers and organizers and donors .
â€œNow this campaign goes forward to the Crescent City , the Motor City and beyond , â€ �
she says .
Generic sauce , until she turns to drawing a sharp contrast with Trump :
This country belongs to all of us , not just those at the top .
Not just the people who look one way , worship one way or even think one way . ...
America is strong when weâ€ ™ re all strong .
Weâ€ ™ ve got work to do .
But that work is not to make America great again .
America never stopped being great .
We have to make America whole .
We have to fill in whatâ€ ™ s been hollowed out .
Her supporters oblige with a Trumplike USA !
USA !
USA ! chant .
â€œI believe what we need in America is more love and kindness.â€ �
The rhetoric weâ€ ™ re hearing on the other side has never been lower .
Trying to divide America between us and them is wrong , and weâ€ ™ re not going to let it work .
Donald Trump has closed the deal in what looked like a close Virginia race , dashing the hopes of team Rubio to show a little Super Tuesday mojo .
The AP has projected Virginia for Trump after a couple hours of concerted counting .
Trump has now blazed to victory in five states and blazed to defeat in zero states .
Clearly a strong night for him .
Watch
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s victory speech live here : Polls are about to close , at 9 pm ET , in Colorado , Minnesota and Texas .
Texas is big .
Colorado is only Democrats .
Minnesota might be a silver lining for Rubio â€ “ if his winless performance so far tonight can be taken as a cloud .
Still at the Parkway Place Baptist Church , still desperately seeking conservatives and , instead , finding wave after wave of Clintonistas .
If these people are any indication , the Clinton campaign needed only to exist as a concept in order to get out the vote .
Thereâ€ ™ s
Jeanne Cole , a 72-year - old part - time worker and Clinton voter , who supported Bill during both presidential contests and more gubernatorial contests than she can remember .
She got a letter from the Clinton campaign , but doesnâ€ ™ t recall ever being left literature or getting a door knock .
She did not hear from the Sanders campaign .
Thereâ€ ™ s a 56-year - old African - American assistant principal in the Little Rock school district , who does not wish us to use his name .
Heâ€ ™ s a lifelong Arkansas resident and has supported the Clintons every year but 2008 , where he broke for Obama .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot of stuff going on in our community that needs to be dealt with , and the Republican party is very divisive , â€ �
he says .
â€œI think Bernie has some real good , strong ideas that need to be looked at , but when you look at the condition of Congress , his ideas are so far left that I donâ€
™ t think he can get a lot of it done .
I donâ€
™ t think his ideas are possible .
Clintonâ€ ™ s more moderate , and I think she can get more things done.â€
�
Then thereâ€ ™ s Lynn Boatner , 48 , another African - American Clinton supporter , lifelong Arkansan and a â€œserial entrepreneurâ€ � , whose campaign exposure was also minimal .
Boatner was not persuaded by the Sanders campaignâ€ ™ s argument about the Clintonsâ€ ™ 1990s record with minorities .
â€œThere are no perfect candidates , and everybody has something to work on , but Hillaryâ€ ™ s a fighter ,
â€ � she says .
â€œSanders talks a good game , but thereâ€ ™ s a whole lot of work to do , and Iâ€ ™ m not sure about his agenda.â€
�
A few scattered conservatives emerge from the voting place â€
”
there are hats , stickers , shirts , or conversation to identify them by â€ ” but they duck and focus on their phones ,
donâ€ ™ t respond to questions or seem outright hostile .
â€œPffffft , â€ � says one one man whose hat is determined to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN .
His comment seems dismissive .
While wins are nice , proportional awarding of delegates tonight means that winning literally isnâ€ ™ t everything .
While Donald Trump has won Alabama , Tennessee and Georgia , thereâ€ ™ s still exciting action in those races and in Vermont .
In those four states ( of states where polls have closed ) , the second - place candidate must win more than 20 % of the vote to get any delegates at all .
And Cruz and Rubio are sitting right on the line , with incomplete returns : In Alabama , with 1.4 % reporting , both Cruz and Rubio are right around 20 % : Rubio is at 20.2 % and Cruz is at 19.8 % .
In Georgia , with 13.5 % reporting , Cruz is at 22.8 % and Rubio is at 20.3 % .
In Tennessee , with 2.1 % reporting , Cruz is at 22 % and Rubio is at 19.1 % .
In Vermont , with 16 % reporting , Trump is at 33.5 % and John Kasich is at 29 % .
But Rubio sits on the cusp , at 19.1 % .
Cruz is in the single digits .
Visit our full results page here : Bernie Sanders supporters are out in full force outside one Denver middle school site , an hour before the Colorado caucus is scheduled to begin .
Of the hundreds waiting to get inside , there are only a small handful of voters wearing Hillary Clinton gear and not a single pro - Clinton lawn sign is visible .
Voter Lizzy Holmgren said she felt torn between Sanders and Clinton - a fact that was visible on her purse , with two Sanders stickers and one Clinton logo .
â€œIf any candidate accepts money from super pacs and banks , how can they govern once they are in office?â€ � said Holmgren , a 30-year - old Denver resident who works in sales .
â€œBut I love Hillaryâ€ ™ s work with human rights and women rights and I think she did a great job as secretary of state , â€ �
she continued .
â€œAnd I would love to see a woman president .
Thatâ€ ™ s what makes me so conflicted ...
This should be an easy vote , but itâ€ ™ s Bernie that had made this a hard decision for me.â€
�
She said she was definitely leaning toward Sanders - but added , â€œWho knows once I get in there?â€

Hillary Clinton has won her home state of Arkansas , the AP immediately projects as polls close .
If her margin is big enough she could take the lionâ€ ™ s share of the stateâ€ ™ s 37 delegates .
A Puerto Rican Rubio voter Frank de Varona in Miami explains why he wonâ€ ™ t be supporting Donald Trump .
Video by Suzette Laboy .
Arkansas polls close at 8.30pm ET .
The state awards 40 Republican delegates and 37 on the Democratic side
â€ “ not a giant prize , but interesting on the GOP side because some polls have shown Ted Cruz leading Donald Trump in the state , and Rubio appears competitive , too .
Candidates must win at least 15 % of the vote to win any delegates at all .
Here are past Arkansas winners :
Pop artist Hector Prado , an immigrant from Colombia , said he hoped to give Clinton this painting tonight at her party in Miami .
If she did not accept , he hoped to sell it , though he wouldnâ€ ™ t name a price .
His goal , he said , was to â€œsoftenâ€ � her appearance and capture her as a woman and mother rather than a politician .
Trump appears to have over - performed , in a sense , among Massachusetts Catholics ... and under - performed among evangelical Christians in the Virginia precinct of Liberty University , whose president , Jerry Falwell Jr , is a major Trump surrogate : Donald Trump is set to speak soon in the white and gold ballroom at Mar - A - Lago Club in Palm Beach , Florida , which he owns .
Guardians politics reporter Ben Jacobs checks out the calculus of the Alabama race â€ “ which is still something of a race , despite Trumpâ€ ™ s win :
Itâ€ ™ s not a surprise that Trump won Alabama and whatâ€ ™ s significant there is not his margin but whether Rubio and Cruz break 20 % .
Under Alabamaâ€ ™ s delegate rules , candidates need to break 20 % statewide to have a decent chance of winning any delegates .
Alabama apportions 29 delegates statewide and three in each of its seven congressional districts .
To qualify for statewide delegates , a candidate needs to break 20 % statewide and needs to hit the same threshold in each congressional district to receive delegates there .
If both Cruz and Rubio are under 20 % statewide , it is unlikely that either will get more than one or two delegates from Alabama , leaving Trump with all the rest .
Many of our readers have kept an eye on the polling predictions and are trying to figure out whether or not the candidates are exceeding expectations or not .
According to Real Clear Politics , Marco Rubio was expected to pick up slightly less than that in Virginia - around 22 % of the Republican vote there .
But itâ€ ™ s still a very important state for the candidate .
The 49 Republican delegates available in Virginia are carved up in proportion to the vote share so this will be a key state for Rubio to pick up some much - needed extra support tonight .
With a visit to our comprehensive results page , youâ€ ™ ll see that with 38.2 % reporting on the Republican side , Donald Trump holds a 37%-30.9 % lead over Marco Rubio in Virginia .
Ted Cruz sits at 16.6 % .
But many of the populous districts in the northern counties â€ “ Rubio country
â€ “ are still missing .
Politics junkies are getting pretty excited about Virginia .
Immediately , Trump is declared the winner in three new states .
Clinton wins in Alabama and Tennessee as well .
Thatâ€ ™ s four states each for Trump ( AL , MA , TN , GA ) and Clinton ( GA , VA , AL , TN ) , and one for Sanders ( VT ) .

Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts reports from the Sanders rally in Burlington , Vermont : â€œItâ€ ™ s good to be home , â€ � said a tired - sounding Bernie Sanders as he celebrated a win in his home state before a rally of adoring supporters .
â€œI am so proud to bring Vermont values all across this countryâ€ � .
The timing of his speech , which is mainly focusing on his core message of taking on the establishment , is interesting , as is the absence of any mention of losses in Georgia and Virginia .
The result in Vermont had been known for about half an hour before he came on stage but nothing had been announced over the tannoy or on the big screen in the hall .
If the heavy losses in the South are indicative of the tough night that the campaign expects , this is perhaps the only window of the evening in which he can give an upbeat speech to keep morale up .
Already there are signs of the narrative that is emerging to deal with any setbacks tonight .
First , this was always about more than just getting to the White House .
â€œI suspect many of you were down on the lake with me when we announced ,
â€ � he tells the crowd .
â€œThis campaign is not just about electing a president , it is about making a political revolution.â€ �
Second , donâ€ ™ t mind the quality , feel the width .
â€œTonight you are going to see a lot of election results come in .. but remember this is not a general election , this is not winner takes all .
By the end of tonight we are going to win many hundreds of delegates , â€ � he adds .
â€œLet me assure you , we are going to take our fight .. to every one of the statesâ€ � , he concludes â€ “ except the last bit of that bold prediction is drowned out by the roar of the crowd .
Many are now leaving the hall .
At 8 pm ET weâ€ ™ ll see another round of poll closings â€ “ Alabama , Massachusetts , Oklahoma , Tennessee , and a lot of polls in Texas .
How will Ted Cruz do in Texas ?
We wonâ€
™ t look for an immediate result , but we have to admit intense interest in those tempting exit polls .
Two races this evening are unresolved so far : the Republicans in Virginia and Vermont .
Ms Miami Dade County is here to support Hillary Clinton on what is shaping up to be a big night for the Demcratic frontrunner .
She is celebrating in Miami tonight , looking ahead to the next major contest , in Florida on 15 March , a sign of her confidence tonight .
Lolisa Wallace said she was looking forward to a great night at Clintonâ€ ™ s big party in downtown Miami .
Wallace , a teacher at Felix Varela Senior High School , said she would love Clinton to speak to teachers during her remarks later this evening .
â€œNo cuts!â€ � Said Wallace .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what Iâ€ ™ d like to hear.â€
�
Wallace said Clinton was an especially powerful role model for young women .
â€œI think that she is a strong and powerful leader ,
â€ � she said .
â€œShe gives women like me power and inspiration to know that we too can be leaders and hang with the big boys!â€
�
The crowd was fired up here at Ice Palace Studios in downtown Miami .
Several TVs around the spacious studio were broadcasting the results live .
The crowd burst into applause when it was announced Clinton had won Georgia .
The blaring pop playlist that typically accompanies a Clinton rally has been replaced by a live music .
Local band Melissa and the Juice had feet tapping with covers of the Black Keys and Creedence Clearwater .
And it wouldnâ€ ™ t be Miami without a little culture .
A Clinton superfan raised a very large canvas water color painting of the former secretary of state above his head and turned it so the whole crowd could see .
The painting inspired a round of â€œHillaryâ€ � chants .
Polling stations in the greater Little Rock area have been moving people smoothly through the process all day , from The Heights , to downtown and back out to the suburbs .
I headed there as the workday ended in search of a more reliable supply of Republican party voters and the attendant excitement of a contest that is not a foregone conclusion .
Instead , at the Parkway Place Baptist Church out in suburban west Little Rock , I found a Bernie Sanders supporter , Charlotte Smith .
A 68-year - old retired registered nurse , Smith discovered Sanders not through the National Nurses United endorsement but through her 16-year - old grandson , who is out canvassing for the candidate , despite not yet being old enough to exercise the franchise .
â€œI think the political discourse needs to trend more toward the socialism heâ€
™ s espousing , â€ � Smith said .
â€œWe need to take more care of the lower classes .
I donâ€ ™ t expect that he will win the nomination , but I want the party to go further toward the left.â€ �
Smith didnâ€ ™ t seem to fear any consequences for her left - wing apostasy in the heart of Clinton country .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t associate with people who donâ€ ™ t agree with me , â€ � she said , and laughed .
The Colorado GOPâ€ ™ s controversial decision to cancel its presidential straw poll could result in the state playing a crucial role in the ultimate nomination of a Republican candidate .
GOP officials in Colorado , a key swing state , decided not to do a traditional presidential preference poll this year due to the national partyâ€ ™ s new rule requiring state delegates to support the candidate who wins on Super Tuesday .
What that means is Colorado will still host Republican caucus events on Tuesday evening , but the results arenâ€ ™ t official and no delegates are bound to support a specific candidate .
Many have criticized this decision , noting that the Republican presidential candidates have in effect ignored Colorado to campaign in other states with much higher stakes .
The Guardian , for example , has been unable to track down any GOP campaign or voter outreach events happening in the Denver metro area in the lead up to the Tuesday night caucus .
But with Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s rise creating an internal crisis for the Republican party , Coloradoâ€ ™ s delegates , who will be free agents , could be critical down the road if the race remains contested and if the other campaigns and party leaders fight to block Trump from the nomination .
â€œWith Donald Trump doing so well in primaries across the country , the fact that Coloradoâ€ ™ s delegates are unpledged could become really important at the convention , â€ � said Peter Hanson , assistant professor of political science at the University of Denver .
â€œIf thereâ€
™ s some kind of convention fight ...
Colorado delegates could become really important players in who the Republicans ultimately nominate ...
If the voting is close , then I think those delegates could throw their support to the winning candidate.â€
�
â€œThe most important issue for me is the direction the country is going to head , â€ �
Matt Dean , 22 , of Juneau , Alaska , tells Julia Oâ€ ™ Malley .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re kind of at a crossroads here ...
What you see is a drastic difference between the Bernie Sanders of the world and the Donald Trumps and then youâ€ ™ ve got the Rubios â€ ¦ Education is a big issue for me , having just left college ; Iâ€ ™ d like to see our university system improve â€ ¦ Youâ€ ™ re starting to see a generation that is more fiscally conservative , but we are more socially aware and more open than the generation [ of Republicans ] preceding us.â€
�
He was voting for Marco Rubio .
Sanders wraps : â€œThank you again for helping us win here tonight .
And I look forward tonight to just saying hello to so many old friendsâ€ � : Donald Trump has found early victory in Georgia , according to AP projections .
The state is the nightâ€ ™ s second - biggest prize with 76 delegates to award .
Candidates need to cross a 20 % threshold to get any delegates at all .
If Rubio and Cruz can stay about 20 % , they will split at least some of the Georgia spoils with Trump .
The AP goes out of its way to say it hasnâ€ ™ t called the Republican race in Georgia .
CNN called it for Trump .
Update : ABC News did too .
Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs wades delicately into exit poll data and sees whether voters have a college diploma as an important variable in the three states where polls have closed : The first round of exit polls from Georgia , Vermont and Virginia show typical patterns in the Republican electorate .
Trump is winning big among poorer and less educated voters while his rivals are doing better among other tranches of the electorate .
Yet again , Trump is also losing late - deciding voters .
An important statistic continues to be whether voters have a college diploma .
In both Virginia and Vermont , 60 % of the voters had college degrees .
That number is down to 51 % in Georgia and that gap is one key reason for why Trump is closing on victory in Georgia and Vermont and Virginia are too close to call .
Itâ€ ™ s also worth noting in Georgia , Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz appear to have split split the anti - Trump vote .
In contrast , Rubio surged in Virginia to become the key repository of establishment voters opposed to Trump , while John Kasich has done the same in Vermont .
Thereâ€ ™ s a serious point being made here
: Aside from the fact that Vermont is Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ home state , the fact that Vermontâ€ ™ s electorate is 96 % white also would have worked in the candidateâ€ ™
s
favor - polling has repeatedly shown that Sandersâ€ ™ s core support base is overwhelmingly white .
If Sanders wants to change his fortunes , results tonight need to show that he has attracted the support of more non - white Democrats .
Bernie Sanders is speaking to an overjoyed crowd in Vermont .
â€œIt is good to be home , â€ � he begins , to big big cheers .
â€œYou know Iâ€ ™ ve been all over this country , but the truth is it is great and great to come home , see all my friends , â€ � he says .
â€œWe want to win in every part of the country ... but it means so much to me that the people who knew me best ... have voted so strongly to put us in the White House .
Thank you so much.â€ � Big cheers .
Watch Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ s victory speech in Vermont live here : The Sanders campaign is fundraising off its big Vermont victory .
But we have to fact check the claim to have won â€œa lot of delegatesâ€ � â€ “ thereâ€ ™ s only one territory with fewer delegates to award tonight than Vermont with 26 ; thatâ€ ™ s American Samoa , which has 11 delegate gifts to give .
Hereâ€ ™ s the top of the Sanders pitch : The polls just closed and we have earned our first victory of the night in Vermont .
It looks like the margin should be impressive as well .
That means a lot of delegates for our campaign , which is very important .
I think we are going to do quite well tonight .
If I hadnâ€ ™ t been expecting to see Bernie Sanders volunteer Michael Gibino , knowing that he was knocking on doors in below - freezing temperatures in a residential St Paul neighborhood , he mightâ€ ™ ve looked like a local giving another slightly - lost driver directions , writes Megan Carpentier in Minnesota .
But , in fact , the driver had pulled over to see if Gibino was lost , and Gibino had used the opportunity â€ “ despite the cold â€ “ to convince the driver to head to caucus on Tuesday evening .
â€œIâ€ ™ m really
hypedâ€ � , he said , after the driver pulled away .
Gibino , an assistant manager at a local Trader Joeâ€ ™ s , took time off work on Saturday , Sunday , Monday and Tuesday to volunteer to go door - to - door to talk to Minnesota voters about caucusing on Tuesday â€ “ something he feels , by all rights , the Minnesota Democractic - Farmer - Labor ( DFL ) party should have been doing more of themselves .
â€œA lot of people donâ€
™ t know where to do or feel intimidated by the process , â€ � he said .
So , since getting Sanders supporters to the caucuses is considered quite important to the candidateâ€ ™ s prospects , Gibino used his long distance running skills to the campaignâ€ ™ s advantage , handing out materials all over the Twin Cities area over the last four days of extremely variable weather conditions â€ “ including doing 14 miles on foot on Sunday in a distant suburb while it first snowed and then rained .
â€œIt makes you feel not just like youâ€ ™ re part of a political movement , but like part of a humanity movement , â€ �
he said of the Sanders campaign .
Kellie Lange , a 28-year - old Denver resident who spent all day canvassing for Hillary Clinton , said her older brother is going to be caucusing for Bernie Sanders .
â€œI get it .
He appeals to peopleâ€ ™ s frustrations , â€ �
she said .
â€œBut anger is not really what we need right now .
What we need is someone who is pragmatic who can get things done - and not someone who is so far left they wonâ€ ™ t accomplish anything.â€ � Lange , a business consultant , said she had been a Clinton supporter since she was a young girl .
â€œShe is the only candidate who has the experience , the temperament and the drive.â€ �
She said she was sick of Sanders supporters - including her brother - questioning Clintonâ€ ™ s sincerity .
â€œShe has always stood for the same things , â€ � Lange said .
â€œWhen people meet her face to face , they see she is very sincere.â€

The top quality voters in both Virginia and Georgia are looking for in a candidate is experience , according to early results of the exit poll conducted by Edison Research for the Associated Press and Television Networks : Clinton won both states .
She drew support from a large majority of those who cared most about a candidate who can win in November .

Hillary Clinton has placed gun control at the center of her presidential campaign , using it to draw contrast with her opponent , Bernie Sanders , writes Lauren Gambino .
But a report in the International Business Times on Tuesday said that a Clinton campaign fundraiser would be co - hosted by Jeff Forbes , a lobbyist whose clients have included the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) .
Asked if that â€œunderminesâ€ � the message and might even drive people to support Sanders , Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign chair , John Podesta , downplayed the issue , while not denying that Forbes would be the co - host .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re trying to raise the resources that are necessary with respect to her positions , â€ � Podesta said during an interview with CNNâ€ ™ s Jake Tapper .
â€œFor example , thereâ€ ™ s no one whoâ€ ™ s been stronger , louder , in taking on the gun lobby than Hillary Clinton .
She has a record in sharp contrast to Senator Sanders whoâ€ ™ s voted five times against the Brady Bill .
Voted to provide immunity to gun owners .
He [ Sanders ] has shifted , to some extent , we welcome that , in the course of this campaign .
But sheâ€ ™ s going to take on the gun lobby , take on Wall Street with comprehensive plan.â€ � Sanders winning Vermont is the least exciting thing to happen tonight , statistically speaking .
I looked at polling averages from Real Clear Politics and Vermont is a clear outlier as the only state a win was near - certain for one Democratic candidate .
Thereâ€ ™ s another reason why the Sanders camp probably wonâ€ ™ t be breaking out the champagne just yet ; only 26 Democratic delegates were up for grabs in Vermont - hardly a game changer .
Whatâ€ ™ s going on in the Republican races in Virginia and Georgia ?
Keep a tab open to our results page .
Zero percent have reported , and unlike on the Democratic side , exit polls were not decisive .
But if you want to look at that exit polling data ... handle with care .
Almost immediately as polls close , the Associated Press projects Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to have won his home state â€ “ as overwhelmingly predicted .
And no big surprise in the Clinton wins in Georgia and Virginia â€ “ the larger delegate hauls , with 109 delegates at stake in Virginia and 117 in Georgia .
The delegates are awarded proportionally , so the final margin will matter .
The first Super Tuesday polls are set to close , in Georgia , Virginia and Vermont .
Follow along here all night as we bring you immediate results from across the country .
On the Democratic side , Bernie Sanders is expected to snap up Vermont , and on the Republican side Georgia is the second - biggest prize of the night after Texas , with 76 delegates to award .
Most interesting of all may be the Republican contest in Virginia , where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are hoping to demonstrate that consistent polling leads by Donald Trump are overrated .
We expect snap projections of 7 pm winners shortly â€ “ you can follow along with all of the eveningâ€ ™ s results on our comprehensive results page .
Hillary Clinton is literally phoning it in ... in Samoa , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Sabrina Siddiqui : It can be easy to forget but
technically tonight isnâ€ ™ t about about vote share â€
“ itâ€ ™ s about delegate share .
How you get from one to the other can involve some tricky math especially among Republicans who use different formulas in different states ( things are far more simple on the Democratic side , where delegates are distributed in proportion to votes ) .
One system used by Republicans is a simple winner - takes - all , where all delegates from the state are awarded to whoever comes first in the primary or caucus ( this is the system used in South Carolina ) .
Other states use a proportional system ( including Alaska , Massachusetts , Minnesota and Virginia who are all voting today ) and some primaries like the one in Texas use a system somewhere between proportionality and simple majority .
Thereâ€ ™ s a full explanation of which system is used in which state here from Frontloading HQ , who also produced the map below .
Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi writes : If , like me , youâ€ ™ re already feeling exhausted by these primaries youâ€ ™ ll be pleased to know that by this time tomorrow weâ€ ™ ll be about a third of the way through the process .
Up until now , just 13 % of Democratic and 5 % of Republican delegates have been pledged to - by Wednesday morning those numbers will have jumped to 24 % and 30 % , respectively .
There is a wistful vibe at the Bernie Sanders rally in Burlington , Vermont , as several thousand local supporters wait for results to start trickling in .
The mood isnâ€ ™ t helped by Ben Folds and various other warm up acts who - while musically excellent - lack a little of the energy of the standard playlist at a Bernie event .
Campaign staff are keen to keep the large media pack focused on their stellar fundraising news in recent days , which they claim is now another reason why their candidate would be a stronger Democratic opponent to put up against Donald Trump .
â€œTrump is going to have plenty of money to compete in November , â€ � said Jeff Weaver , Sandersâ€ ™ s campaign manager .
â€œItâ€ ™ s important that our nominee be able to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to defeat the Republicans in November .
Secretary Clintonâ€ ™ s reliance on maxed - out mega - donors isnâ€ ™ t sustainable and should scare Democrats who want to keep the White House in November.â€

Hereâ€ ™ s just a little more super for your Tuesday : Adam Gabbatt has just been to Belmont University in Nashville , where primary voting is going on , as is a five - piece acoustic guitar show .
The weather is still miserable here , which is a great shame as Iâ€ ™ ve brought my sunglasses and everything and was hoping to get a bit of a tan .
But hey , you canâ€ ™ t win â€˜em all .
Later on I will be hanging out on Broadway in downtown Nashville , where bands play in every bar and men on bachelor parties get drunk in every bar .
For now here are two voters I spoke to .
â€œSheâ€
™ s the lesser of the evils , â€ � said Charlotte Dinkins , 52 , who voted for Hillary Clinton .
â€œI nearly asked for a Republican ballot .
Trump I donâ€ ™ t like , but heâ€ ™ s consistent .
Heâ€ ™ s consistently an ass .
He believes in what heâ€ ™ s saying to the point where Iâ€ ™ d almost believe him too .
He is abrasive , heâ€ ™ s an irritant , but heâ€ ™ s very convicted .
He is a businessman and realistically our economy needs a little fixing .
â€œ[But ] Iâ€ ™ m stuck on the fact that the Democratic way is the right way
and Hillary has the experience .
Plus I think itâ€ ™ s time for a woman.â€ �
She added : â€œI still believe in this country .
My life is kind of consistent .
A lot of the things that rock most of the world donâ€
™ t bother me .
When the economy dropped , I was poor anyway .
When youâ€ ™ re poor how do you know when the countryâ€ ™ s poor ?
You almost have the advantage when you start poor , and the rest of the people are going crazy ,
itâ€ ™ s like :
â€˜This is the way it is .
Calm down .
â€œThe Democrats are more inclusive with regard to race and the other different preferences .
I think the Democrats , we have a reputation and a long - standing history of being inclusive .
Weâ€ ™ ve got blacks as president and hopefully weâ€ ™ ll get a woman as president.â€ �
â€œI donâ€ ™ t support Donald Trump , â€ � agreed Dominic Malnar , a 21-year - old student who voted for Marco Rubio .
â€œI think heâ€
™ s kind of a tyrant .
I like Bernie Sanders
but I think heâ€ ™ s trying to do too much .
As for making it a socialist government , while that might sound nice it could end up not helping our country in the long run .
And I just thought : â€˜Marco Rubio , heâ€ ™ s an honest , good man , had good values.â€ ™ â€œItâ€ ™
s kind of scary , because as soon as this election is over , for guys of my age and many other people weâ€ ™
re just getting out of college .
And this is the government that we have to follow .
We canâ€
™ t use our parents any more , weâ€ ™ ve got to be on our own .
If our country isnâ€ ™ t in a good place it could hurt a lot of jobs for us .
I graduate in May and
I soon as I graduate Iâ€ ™ m in the fire.â€ �
What do we know about the Americans who are voting today ?
Thanks to the US Census Bureau , quite a lot , writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi :
In Alabama and Georgia , the population is almost a third black .
In both of those states , Hillary Clinton has a large lead on Bernie Sanders ( polling has repeatedly shown that Sandersâ€ ™ inability to attract non - white voters is a big weakness for the candidate and could ultimately prove to be his downfall ) .
In Texas and Colorado , Hispanic voters will have a major say in Democratic outcomes ( in those states too , Hillary is doing very well ) .
Four out of five adults in Tennessee say that religion is important to them as the graphic below from Pew Research Center shows .
The vast majority of them are evangelical Protestants , a group which has been favorable to Ted Cruz in the past and will prove particularly important in influencing outcomes in Texas tonight .
â€œBeing in Alaska , the most important thing for us is keeping Alaska open for business , not locking up any more land , not putting any more restrictions on responsible resource development , â€ �
Kate Blair , 36 , tells Julia Oâ€ ™ Malley in Anchorage .
â€œPart of the reason I am voting in my first presidential primary
is so I can vote against Trump ; I think
heâ€
™ s a a huge embarrassment to the Republican party ...
I think a lot of people feel that way.â€ � She is supporting Marco Rubio .
Of the states with polls set to begin closing in about 40 minutes , the most exciting may be Virginia , which awards 49 delegates on the Republican side and which hosts a mix of highly educated voters in the north around Washington DC and low - income voters in the central state and rural west .
If Trump does well in Virginia , it could point to a strong night for him overall .
But Marco Rubio spent all Saturday campaigning here
â€ “ and an early win would be a huge boost for his candidacy .
Here are past winners of the Virginia primaries : Hereâ€ ™ s a state - by - state guide to when the polls close tonight : In Georgia , Vermont , and Virginia , polls begin closing at 7 pm EST .
In Alabama , Massachusetts , Oklahoma , Tennessee and Texas , polls begin closing at 8 pm EST .
In Arkansas , polls begin closing at 8:30pm EST .
In Minnesota and Colorado , polls begin closing at 9 pm EST .
In Alaska , polls begin closing at 12 am EST .
David Smith checks in from Palm Beach , Florida , where Donald Trump will give a press conference later on at his Mar - a - Lago estate .
â€œItâ€

he has chosen Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s home state ,
â€ � notes David .
Students at Liberty University , an evangelical stronghold in Virginia that has become a presidential campaign trail magnet in recent years , told the Guardian on Tuesday they have reservations about Donald Trump , writes Lucia Graves :
The schoolâ€ ™ s president , Jerry Falwell , recently endorsed Trump , who has been making inroads with Christian voters around the country .
But conversations with the schoolâ€ ™ s young attendees suggest he still has a lot of work to do .
In a series of interviews with students at the schoolâ€ ™ s on - campus voting site , students repeatedly expressed concern about Trumpâ€ ™ s character , even as they praised his business acumen .
Kevin Zahne , a sophomore accounting major said he doesnâ€ ™ t favor Trump because heâ€ ™ s â€œkind of harsh and mean.â€
�
To back it up he noted â€œlook at his past ,
heâ€ ™ s gone through many wives and everything with him feels very much like a business transaction.â€
�
Zahne prefers doctor Ben Carson , whom he describes as â€œa good person.â€ �
But heâ€ ™ s realistic
about Carsonâ€ ™ s chances .
â€œIf
it were between him and Clinton , Iâ€ ™
d still vote for him , â€ � he concedes of Trump .
Jazzlyn Taylor , a freshman at Liberty , from what she describes as â€œa military family , â€ � agrees .
Whiles she likes Trump on fiscal issues , he loses her when it comes to social ones .
â€œThe whole wall plan , â€ � is something she disapproves of .
â€œWhy
would you do that?â€
� she asks .
Her friend Meleena Morgan , also a freshman , feels similarly .
â€œI want any president to be professional and heâ€ ™ s not professional , â€ � Morgan says of Trump .
â€œHeâ€ ™ ll call people names and kick them out of events .
Itâ€ ™ s not a professional thing to
do.â€ �
Exit polls â€ “ those sketchy vessels of
pseudo - data that probe how high in the minds of Alabama voters was the upset win of Spotlight at the Oscars â€
“ are here again , and , as usual , we here provide you with a link to them without inviting you to click through or draw any rash conclusions based on what you find there .
But if youâ€ ™ re the kind of news consumer who likes to know that more primary voters in most of todayâ€ ™ s Southern states think race relations have gotten worse in the last few years than say theyâ€ ™ re better â€ “ have at it .
At Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s bustling Minneapolis headquarters ( located upstairs in the Minneapolis Plumbers Union Local 15 building ) on Tuesday afternoon , volunteers manned phones in every nook and cranny â€ “ including at chairs in the supply closets , their computers resting on shelves
â€ “ making calls to voters about the eveningâ€ ™ s caucuses .
The majority of the volunteers were young women , though maybe not quite as young as Mari Adams , 19 , and Hannah Alstead , 20 , two fellows with the campaign who both swore that they were â€œlong - timeâ€ � Clinton fans .
Adams said sheâ€ ™ d been a Clinton supporter since she was 10 , adding â€œI have a political family and am pretty passionate about women in politicsâ€ � ; Alstead , who said she â€œgrew up walking in parades for my grandpa when he ran for Senateâ€ � , called Clinton â€œby far the most inspirational person Iâ€ ™ ve ever had the chance to meet.â€ � Alstead , a political science major at the University of Minnesota , Twin Cities campus , said of the caucuses that , in her experience , â€œPeople havenâ€ ™ t made it that big a dealâ€ � , and that , while thereâ€ ™ s definitely support for Bernie Sanders on campus â€œI also see it for Hillary Clinton and other candidates.â€ �
But given her fellow political science majorsâ€ ™ intellectual interests , she surprised that there isnâ€ ™ t more passion for the caucuses and the race .
â€œWhen
I turned 18â€ � , she said â€œthe first thing I wrote on Facebook was â€˜Finally , Iâ€ ™ ll be able to vote!â€ ™ â€ � â€œTo be able to vote in this election and to say that I was able to work for Secretary Clinton and hopefully be able to push her though the caucuses ...
I just hope I get the opportunity to vote for her again in November ,
â€ � she added .
Adams added , grinning ear - to - ear : â€œIâ€ ™ m beyond excited !
Voting is ...
Election Day is like a holiday to me .
â€œI think we made a difference ,
I really do.â€

What were the candidates up to today ?
Both Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio passed through Minneapolis , Minnesota ; Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz voted in their respective home states of Vermont and Texas ; and Donald Trump visited ... Ohio , which is not technically a Super Tuesday state .
Ted Cruz urges rivals to leave presidential race for sake of â€˜unityâ€ ™ Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson went on MSNBC and said â€œof
courseâ€ �
heâ€ ™ d been asked to get out of the race by unnamed party officials but that â€œmillions of social media fansâ€
�
contributing money had convinced him not to take the partyâ€ ™ s advice .
Carson did beat Ohio governor John Kasich in Nevada .
Kasich , for his part , has said that Trump might perform a clean sweep of tonightâ€ ™ s voting ... but you canâ€ ™ t stop him with insults : Sanders hopes for high turnout Rubio : â€˜I feel very optimisticâ€ ™ Laredo resident David Cortez has a Trump sign in his front yard â€ “ perhaps the only Trump sign in a border city that was 96 % Hispanic or Latino at the 2010 census , in a county where Barack Obama won 77 % of the vote in 2012 .
Certainly , this reporter spent several hours driving around the city on Tuesday afternoon in a vain effort to find another one .
â€œItâ€ ™ s surprising
how many people have mentioned my sign and they said : â€˜You know , itâ€ ™ s just not kosher to put up a Trump sign
but we are going to support him , â€ ™ â€ � Cortez said .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot of hidden Republicans that are going to come out because they are like me : they want something better for our families .
Youâ€ ™ re going to be surprised at the amount of votes that Trump gets out of the entire [ Rio Grande ]
Valley.â€ � The 83-year - old was not deterred by Trumpâ€ ™ s description last year of many Mexican migrants as criminals and rapists .
â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t offend me that he says anything about rapists .
If theyâ€ ™ re rapists theyâ€ ™ re rapists , if theyâ€ ™ re thieves theyâ€ ™ re thieves , OK ?
Simple as that .
Why should we be offended ?
Heâ€ ™ s only bringing out the truth
, â€ � said Cortez , who is of Mexican descent .
â€œI think the wall is the answer .
The Vatican has the wall and it keeps people out .
Other nations have walls .
So weâ€ ™ re not the first ones .
Letâ€ ™ s just hope that that stems the flow of drugs into the US.â€ � Unable to source an official campaign sign - it is fair to say that Trumpâ€ ™ s ground game in border communities is weak - Cortez made his own , from a door .
â€œThis door is an indication that my door is always open to Mr Trump , â€ �
he said .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ben Jacobs is with Ted Cruz in Texas , but we suspect he is busy composing a yearâ€ ™ s worth of tweets to fill out the ingenious timeline in which the Huffington Post imagines â€œIf Presidential Candidates Throughout History Tweeted Like Donald Trumpâ€
�
: Weâ€ ™ ve collectively interviewed a lot of voters today , and if you scroll through the dayâ€ ™ s earlier live blog youâ€ ™ ll find a lot of mini - interviews in most every state
thatâ€ ™ s been voting .
Hereâ€ ™ s a new one â€ “ Santino Martinez , a 24-year - old Colorado Springs resident and cannabis grower , who hopes the stateâ€ ™ s marijuana industry lines up behind Bernie Sanders .
â€œI feel like Bernie is pro - pot , â€ � said Martinez , who works in Coloradoâ€ ™ s legal weed industry , which has boomed over the last two years .
â€œIf
he legalizes pot , it can destroy the black market and bring prices down ...
Cannabis is really a medicine and thatâ€ ™ s what the future of the industry is .
So that means cheaper medicine for people ...
It wouldnâ€ ™ t be such a burden on consumers.â€ � Sanders hasnâ€ ™ t fully embraced the idea of legal marijuana , but he has generally been more progressive and less cautious on the subject than Hillary Clinton .
Martinez noted that Sanders also often talks about the importance of decriminalizing marijuana given that the enforcement of drug laws disproportionately affects people of color .
â€œThat message speaks to Latino and black folks ... and that resonates with people in the business , but also on a heart level , â€ � said Martinez , who is Mexican and black and was helping canvass for Sanders in Denver starting at 5 am on Super Tuesday .
â€œWe should be pardoning people who are in prison for crimes that are harmless , like minor possession.â€ �
Having trouble keeping track of all the states flying around tonight ?
Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi has you covered with a primer on all 13 locations ( 12 states plus American Samoa ) that will , together , shape the rest of the race .
Consider , for example , Texas :
Texas Primaries held : Democratic and Republican presidential primaries .
Delegates :
155 Republican delegates , 251 Democratic delegates .
Things to watch out for :
Just watch everything .
With so many delegates , Texas will be an incredibly important state in determining the presidential candidates in this election .
Cruz is leading in the polls in Texas ; a win could help turn the candidateâ€ ™
s fortunes around at the national level .
In 2008 , Texans voted for Clinton , a fact which might still work in her favour eight years later .
Demographics :
In the last national election , Texas had one of thelowest turnout rates in the country .
After New Mexico , this is the most important Latino voting state in the country â€ “ 35 % of voters here are Hispanic .
Read the full state - by - state primer here : Greetings , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of Super Tuesday , the biggest voting day on the American election calendar until November and a potential turnstile - of - no - return in the partiesâ€ ™ respective efforts to nominate someone for president .
Will we know whether Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are the nominees by nightâ€ ™ s end ?
Not conclusively , it seems .
But the 12 states voting tonight will award about 20 - 25 % of the total delegates at stake and weâ€ ™ re likely to have , in a matter of hours , a much - improved picture of where this thing is headed .
This blog will bring you results immediately as they emerge .
Weâ€ ™ ll tell you whether Senator Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas , or whether Trump stole it from under his nose .
And whether Senator Marco Rubio picked off Minnesota or Virginia or another state , or whether his non - wins were strong enough to keep him in plausible contention .
On the Democratic side , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is expected to best Clinton easily in his home state , which votes tonight , and heâ€ ™ s also running hard in neighboring Massachusetts .
But Clinton looks strong throughout the south and in Texas , the nightâ€ ™ s big delegate prize on both sides .
The first polls close at 7 pm ET ( more info on that to come ) , with victory projections expected right away in some cases .
After eight or so months of asking voters to support them , the candidates tonight will get unequivocal answers in the form of actual vote tallies from far and wide .
Speaking of far and wide â€ “ while this blog will be anchored from New York City , Guardian reporters are on the ground tonight across the country .
Dan Roberts is with Bernie Sanders in Vermont , Sabrina Siddiqui is with Marco Rubio in Miami , Ben Jacobs is with Ted Cruz in Texas , David Smith is with Donald Trump in Palm Beach , Florida , and Lauren Gambino is with Hillary Clinton in Miami .
In addition , Matthew Teague is filing from Alabama , Lois Beckett from Vermont , Richard Wolffe from Georgia , Lucia Graves from Virginia , Jill Abramson from Massachusetts , Megan Carpentier from Minnesota , Jeb Lund from Arkansas , Sam Levin from Colorado , Julia Oâ€ ™ Malley from Alaska , and Adam Gabbatt from Tennessee .
Do you think this will be Trumpâ€ ™ s big night ?
Detect any weaknesses in the Clinton bid ?
See any chance for the Rubio fantasy of a Cruz loss in Texas playing out ?
As always , let us know in the comments â€ “ and thanks for following along and joining in !"
2016-03-02,"A candidate who has described Mexicans as rapists and criminals and whose core immigration plan is to make Mexico pay for a giant wall ought not to prosper on the southern border .
Yet Donald Trump was embraced on Tuesday by voters in Americaâ€ ™ s most Hispanic city .
Trump won almost 35 % of the Republican primary vote in Webb County , where Laredo is the county seat , comfortably ahead of Marco Rubio ( 28.4 % ) and Ted Cruz ( 28.2 % ) , the Hispanic senator from Texas who finished first in the state overall .
Not that it takes a lot of GOP votes to win here
â€ “ only 4,089 were cast in the race , compared with nearly 26,000 among Democrats .
Laredo is 96 % Hispanic or Latino , according to the 2010 census , and it is hugely Democratic : Barack Obama won 77 % of the vote in the county in 2012 .
In an unusual spurt of eloquence , twice - failed GOP presidential hopeful and former Texas governor Rick Perry once called the border the blueberry in the tomato soup : a speck of nutrition for Democrats in a Republican - dominated state .
Despite the limited GOP voter pool , it is notable â€ “ and jarring â€ “ that Trump should not only triumph here but generally perform better in border counties than in the Texas interior , where Cruz was in command .
After some small - scale polling at the Nevada caucuses , Tuesdayâ€ ™ s outcome provided harder evidence that Trump has not been shunned by conservative Latinos .
He may even have inspired them into action : he won more votes in Webb County than were cast in its primary in total in 2012 .
One Trump voter in Laredo , who gave her name as Cindy , said he is popular with local elderly people who are â€œtired of the systemâ€ � .
Jon Melendez , president of the Webb County Young Republicans , speculated that Trumpâ€ ™ s success owed something to Democrats voting for him because he would be easier for Hillary Clinton to beat in November .
â€œIn the fall , the Democrats will be absolutely energised to vote against him , â€ � Melendez said .
Trump bested two Hispanic senators who have also talked tough on immigration , in Rubio and Cruz â€ “ though both have Cuban heritage , rather than Mexican or Central American , and there is resentment at a US policy that fast - tracks admission and residency for growing numbers of Cubans while migrants from other countries have far bigger hurdles to overcome .
That situation is one example of the complexities and contradictions here that elude the bombastic rhetoric and uncompromising immigration positions of the main Republican presidential candidates .
Laredo is a characterful place of bridges and barriers ; of ramshackle little homes , pastel - coloured hole - in - the - wall taquerias and family - run auto repair centres , with a decayed downtown of thrift stores , sagging shoe shops , bright currency exchanges and buildings whose grandeur faded long ago .
Laredoâ€ ™ s small - town familiarity and stability is interspersed with with busy crossings , a railway bridge and an interstate highway that barges through the centre of the city to speed trucks northwards where the sprawl subsides into ranchland and flat emptiness and the roving white and green SUVs of the border patrol .
It is the largest inland port on the US - Mexico border , mentioned soon after Los Angeles and New York in scale of international trade .
Its population is about 250,000 , though the county is vast : two - thirds the size of the LA metropolitan area .
It snuggles up to Nuevo Laredo , the more populous and notoriously violent Mexican city on the other side of the serpentine Rio Grande .
Laredoâ€ ™ s biggest festival is a near month - long celebration of George Washingtonâ€ ™ s birthday with a jalapeÃ±o - eating contest as its highlight .
Laredo carries on its broad shoulders an irony shared with frontier towns across the world : that the governmental apparatus of scrutiny , suspicion and separation is at its most prominent , its most stubbornly wedged , between communities that have the most in common .
â€œWe talk about security but we like to have a balance between security , legitimate trade and tourism so when somebody comes in and says â€˜I want to build a wall and secure the borderâ€ ™ that goes contrary to our daily life that we have in Laredo , â€ � said Henry Cuellar , a Democrat who is the districtâ€ ™ s US congressman .
Erick Barroso is a 42-year - old corrections officer who votes for some Democratic candidates in local elections , depending on whoâ€ ™ s running .
Often , Democrats are the only names on the ballot .
But he is leaning towards Trump in Novemberâ€ ™ s general election .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t agree with the wall , â€ � he said .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a saying , if you build 20 ft walls youâ€ ™ re going to sell 21 ft ladders
â€ ¦ Theyâ€ ™ re always going to find ways [ to cross ] , a wall isnâ€
™ t the perfect solution.â€
�
But heâ€ ™ s not seeing anyone else suggest a better idea right now .
While immigration measures naturally have the most profound and immediate impact on border - dwellers , Barrosoâ€ ™ s reasoning for backing Trump could have come from one of his supporters in Pittsburgh , or Louisville , or Minneapolis .
The rationale stems from personality , not policy .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s strong and heâ€ ™ s very confident , â€ � Barroso said .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t support everything he says but a lot of the things , heâ€ ™ s not afraid to say it .
I see that as a strong characteristic.â€ � Laredo experienced Trumpâ€ ™ s self - belief and self - promotion up close last July when he paid a brief visit , a month after kicking off his campaign by claiming that Mexico is â€œsending people that have lots of problems , and theyâ€ ™ re bringing those problems with us .
Theyâ€ ™ re bringing drugs .
Theyâ€ ™ re bringing crime .
Theyâ€ ™ re rapists .
And some , I assume , are good people.â€ �
After an outcry , the local border patrol union rescinded its invitation to the candidate , though Trump came anyway â€ “ and was shown around by the cityâ€ ™ s mayor , a Democrat .
He portrayed himself as bravely trekking into dangerous territory , but crime figures suggest Texasâ€ ™ s border cities are some of the safest in the state .
Reports indicate there were more media and police than protesters .
One of the demonstrators was Henry Rodriguez , of the League of United Latin American Citizens , who came down from San Antonio to heckle the tycoon .
â€œWe went and made a big old ruckus over there , â€ � he recalled .
â€œThe more he talks against immigrants , it seems like the more brownie points he gets .
Itâ€ ™ s sad because itâ€ ™ s kind of a mentality that still exists in this country , of haters.â€ � The 71-year - old is frustrated by the lack of empathy and nuance in the political discourse on immigration .
â€œThere are a good number of Republican Latinos , their parents came from Mexico or Central America or other places like South America , they really donâ€ ™ t care much about people that are coming over now .
Theyâ€ ™
re saying theyâ€ ™ re taking away resources from them , â€ � he said .
â€œBut the ones that come here want to better themselves and theyâ€ ™ ll do anything , theyâ€ ™ ll start off take lower wages than anyone , taking jobs nobody else will do.â€ � Melendez , a 30-year - old student and former marine , said that â€œa lot of us here see it day to day , there is an illegal influx of people coming from Mexico and that needs to be addressed .
However , the tone and the rhetoric and everything else coming out of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s mouth has been counterproductive.â€ � â€œI can get behind somebody who wants to secure the border , â€ �
he added .
â€œBut I think that Trump has just been awful.â€ �
Before Tuesday night , that view would have seemed like conventional wisdom .
But even in Laredo , demagoguery confounded demographics ."
2016-03-03,"In a new paper , Carl Mears and Frank Wentz at Remote Sensing Systems ( RSS ) have revised their data set estimating the temperature of the Earthâ€ ™ s atmosphere .
At his recent congressional hearing , Ted Cruz presented the RSS data to incorrectly claim that thereâ€ ™ s been no global warming in over 18 years .
As I noted at the time , RSS had the only data that could remotely support Senator Cruzâ€ ™ s argument .
Surface and ocean temperatures have warmed , ice has melted , sea levels have risen , species have been forced to migrate , spring has begun earlier , and so on .
Even other estimates of the atmospheric temperature , of the same satellite data by scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville ( UAH ) , and by weather balloons , indicate that the atmosphere is warming .
Ted Cruz cherry picked RSS because it was the lone outlier that seemed to support his preferred argument against the need to take action to mitigate the risks posed by human - caused global warming .
Thatâ€ ™ s no longer the case .
In their new paper , Mears and Wentz detail the revised RSS method to account for drift in the time of day at which satellites measure the same location on Earth ( known as â€œdiurnal driftâ€ � , discussed by Mears at the 0:47 mark in the above video ) .
They applied a method suggested by Stephen Po - Chedley and colleagues at the University of Washington in an important paper covered by John Abraham last year .
As a result , the new version of RSS ( v4.0 ) shows about 60 % more warming than the previous version ( v3.3 ) since the record began in 1979 .
This new adjustment also helps to reconcile the divergence between atmospheric temperature estimates from satellites and weather balloons .
Over most of the temperature record , the estimates using the two different types of instruments have been similar , and the satellite data are calibrated with the weather ballon data .
However , over the past decade , the weather balloons had shown significantly more atmospheric warming than the satellite estimates .
RSS v4.0 goes a long way toward bringing these measurements into closer agreement .
As Joe Romm noted at Climate Progress , Roy Spencer and John Christy at UAH speculated over 4 years ago that the RSS diurnal drift correction method was introducing a cool bias into their record .
my UAH cohort and boss John Christy , who does the detailed matching between satellites , is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing spurious cooling because RSS is still using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit , to which they are then applying a diurnal cycle drift correction based upon a climate model , which does not quite match reality .
This new paper and latest RSS adjustment once again highlight the challenges scientists face in converting measurements of atmospheric microwave emissions by satellites in orbit into a synthetic temperature estimate .
Itâ€ ™ s a complicated process that requires a complex model with large uncertainties involved , and as Carl Mears has noted , itâ€ ™ s certainly unwise to rely exclusively on these estimates of one small component of the Earthâ€ ™ s climate to evaluate global warming .
Nevertheless , Spencer has just reported that February 2016 was the hottest month on record in the UAH data set ; the same is true of RSS , and weather balloons are also registering record hot atmospheric temperatures , as the above chart shows .
Itâ€ ™ s now clear that Senator Cruz has been hoisted by his own petard .
He and his hearing witnesses claimed that the satellite data from RSS represent our best measurement of global warming .
While thatâ€ ™ s not true , this latest correction to the RSS record shows that global warming continues , in the atmosphere as with every other component of the Earthâ€ ™ s climate , at record hot levels .
Instead of congressional hearings denying the existence of global warming , we need hearings to debate the best way to solve the problem ."
2016-03-03,"Barring some historic and unprecedented collapse , the US presidential election will be a heavyweight slugfest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump : a contest between one candidate who says she wants to see more love and kindness , and another who says he wants to punch protesters in the face .
Thatâ€ ™ s not to say the primary rhetoric wonâ€
™ t persist for a while .
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio will still hurl mud at Trump as they indulge in the fantasy of a brokered convention that could deny a man who has built his career on hurling mud and indulging fantasies .
Bernie Sanders will continue to talk about a revolution against the selfish and corrupt super - wealthy class while Democrats increasingly revel in Clintonâ€ ™ s attacks on a man who embodies the selfish and corrupt super - wealthy class .
And we in the beloved media will do our very best to pretend this primary is real .
Because : clicks and ratings .
But in reality Super Tuesday performed its traditional role : it confirmed the results of the early voting states , and set the frontrunners on a glide path to the nomination .
Those results are clear .
Republican voters are in a revolutionary mood .
They want more change , not less .
They want an anti - establishment candidate
who ( frankly , my dear ) doesnâ€ ™ t give a damn about credibility , consistency or conventional politics .
Democratic voters want less change , not more .
The minorities who are the bedrock of the party love President Obama and his record , but want a stronger and fairer economy .
Above all , they want to stop the Republican extremism that has deadlocked the country for the last six years .
At this stage , all that matters is the delegate count â€ “ not momentum , nor the number of states won .
To overcome the delegate leads of Trump and Clinton , their rivals need landslides , and lots of them .
Winning a landslide victory in the mighty state of Vermont is not a foundation for success .
Especially if â€ “ like Sanders â€ “ it has been your home since the Jurassic age of politics .
And winning marginal victories elsewhere doesnâ€ ™ t count for much .
If you add up all the delegate leads for Sanders in the four states he won yesterday , you find that Clinton pocketed more of a lead in the single state of Georgia â€ “ before we start counting super - delegates , who lean heavily towards her .
In todayâ€ ™ s Republican party , the split wins are the best possible outcome for Trump , which perhaps explains his unctuous attempt to congratulate Ted Cruz for winning his home state of Texas .
It is entirely in Trumpâ€ ™ s interest to perpetuate the fraud that Cruz and Rubio should stay in the race and continue to divide opposition to Trump inside the GOP .
Not that their presence will make any difference to the final outcome .
The Republican national committee stacked the deck by changing the delegate rules of later - voting states ( after 15 March ) from proportional allocation to a winner - takes - all system â€ “
Tthe idea being to prevent a Romney - like nominee from getting dragged into an extended fight with a Trump - like outsider .
Itâ€ ™ s at about this time that supporters of the also - rans point to the states their candidates have won : surely Sanders winning in Colorado is a sign of his electability .
Surely it doesnâ€
™ t matter about Clintonâ€ ™ s victories in the south , where the Democrats never win in the general election .
With the Trump factor making this such an unpredictable year , it is hard to forecast what will happen in the general election .
After several more months of freakout by the Republican establishment , it is possible that the Never - Trumpniks will stay at home rather than vote for someone they openly deride as a hate - mongering conman .
Take the reliably Republican state of Georgia , where demographic projections suggest that minorities will represent a majority of the stateâ€ ™ s population in under a decade .
Democrats havenâ€ ™ t won Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992 , but now a Trump candidacy is leading to a reconsideration of the Republican lock .
â€œIt would be competitive because certainly thereâ€ ™ s a considerable amount of Republicans in Georgia , especially members of the business establishment , who would never support Trump , â€ � says Merle Black , a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta .
â€œWhether or not they would actively work for Clinton , I donâ€ ™ t know .
But there would be large defections from the usual Republican groups here in Georgia .
The big unknown is whether Trump would attract people who havenâ€ ™ t voted in the recent past : Democrats and independents.â€ �
Those disaffected voters are the blue - collar workers who have been screwed by economic upheaval caused by global trade and new technology .
They were Reagan Democrats and are now attracted to the anti - trade message of both Trump and Sanders .
Which helps explain why Clinton delivered a victory speech that was light on Trump - bashing .
Pivoting to the general election , she namechecked every voting group that she needs to improve her tally in a contest against Trump .
Trump could savour a consistent string of wins on Super Tuesday in a way that only he could pull off : sheer head - spinning inconsistency .
â€œLook , Iâ€
™ m a unifier , â€ �
Trump asserted before tearing into everyone else .
â€œOnce we get all of this finished , Iâ€ ™ m going to go after one person : Hillary Clinton , â€ � he promised .
â€œThey are declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of the night , â€ � he continued .
Trump is a special kind of unifier â€ “ the kind who feels most whole when he wins and other people lose .
â€œI feel awfully good , â€ �
he told the media .
Meanwhile , the rest of the Republican party felt just awful ."
2016-03-04,"The 11th Republican presidential debate has concluded .
Hereâ€ ™ s a breakdown of what happened : Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took up where they left off in the last debate , throwing roundhouse punches at Donald Trump , the frontrunner .
Notable attacks were leveled at Trump University , which stands accused of fraud , and at Trumpâ€ ™ s seriousness as an immigration hawk .
Did it work ?
The billionaire businessman seemed frustrated at moments , growing red and seeming annoyed , repeating himself and not always succeeding at finding on - point defenses .
But he didnâ€ ™ t explode onstage or anything .
One of the most potentially damaging moments for Trump , however , came at the hands of Fox News host Megyn Kelly , who brandished court documents to bring alive the class - action suit against Trump University , which former students accuse of delivering next to nothing in return for thousands of tuition dollars .
Trump was driven to repeatedly saying â€œletâ€ ™ s see what happens at the end of three yearsâ€ � , in reference to the anticipated resolution of the lawsuit , which he downplayed as a â€œminor civil caseâ€ � .
Florida senator Rubio said that Trump was trying to put the same fraud over on American voters as he put over on Trump University students , in both cases selling a bill of goods .
Texas senator Cruz repeatedly called on Trump to â€œrelease the tapesâ€ � of an off - the - record conversation Trump had with New York Times editors , in which Trump supposedly expressed secret flexibility in his immigration stance .
Trump said he would not call for the release of the audio recordings , because his respect for the journalism ground rules for off - the - record conversations was simply too great .
Trump also admitted he was moderating his earlier opposition to more visas for highly skilled immigrant workers .
Might his seeming moderation on immigration hurt him with his base ?
Ohio governor John Kasich won repeated applause for bringing the conversation back to the details of policy and describing how to revive public schools , how to balance the budget and how to downsize government .
Kasich said that people tell him he is the only adult onstage in these debates .
Trump was questioned about how the military could follow his potentially extra - legal orders to , for example , kill the family of a suspected terrorist .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ll do as I tell them , â€ �
Trump said .
Rubio accused Trump of being unable to speak in depth about policy in any area , and of instead resorting to personal attacks .
Trump at one point replied by calling Rubio â€œlittle Marcoâ€ � .
Rubio smirked and said : â€œletâ€ ™ s hear it big Donaldâ€ � .
Speaking of light moments , Cruz fell to mocking Trump at one point by telling him to â€œbreathe , breathe , breatheâ€ � .
Rubio made a crack about yoga .
Cruz quipped he hoped there would be no yoga onstage .
Rubio delivered the punch line , gesturing to Trump :
â€œHeâ€ ™ s flexible enough.â€ �
Trump early on appeared to boast about the size of his penis .
He noted that Rubio had accused him of having small hands and seemed to imply that his , Trumpâ€ ™ s , penis was similarly small .
â€œI guarantee you thereâ€
™ s
no problem , â€ �
Trump reassured the audience ."
2016-03-04,"Donald Trump faced a barrage of attacks from rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz on Thursday night during a Republican presidential debate that was at times nasty and crude but offered few moments that looked likely to reset a race that remains Trumpâ€ ™ s to lose .
The two senators ganged up for a second time in a row on the brash billionaire over his immigration stance , business record and overall temperament , but Trump swatted them away by condescendingly branding them â€œLittle Marcoâ€ � and â€œLying Tedâ€ � .
In return , his rivals treated Trump like a belligerent child .
At one point Cruz chastised his rival : â€œCount to 10 , Donald .
Count to
10.â€ �
The debate in Detroit was , in many ways , emblematic of the Republican partyâ€ ™ s core struggle , with time running short for the party establishment to blunt Trumpâ€ ™ s path to the nomination .
The tone of schoolyard taunts rather than substantive discussion was set no more than 10 minutes after the candidates took the stage at the Fox Theatre , with Trump referencing the size of his genitalia during an exchange with Rubio over his hands .
Responding to personal attacks Rubio recently made on the campaign trail , in which the Florida senator mocked his opponent as having small hands , Trump held out his arms and exclaimed : â€œLook at those hands .
Are those small?â€ �
He went on to note that Rubio had used his hands as part of a metaphor for other parts of his body , an argument Trump dismissed : â€œI guarantee you there is no problem .
I guarantee.â€
�
It marked the bleak beginning to an evening that vacillated between a shouting match with occasional discussion of more meaningful affairs , such as the hiring of foreign workers and the war against the Islamic State .
Much of the debate focused on Trump , as the presumptive nominee , and the lawsuits against his now - defunct eponymous university as well as his sincerity on immigration .
Yet for all the viciousness and personal attacks , all the Republicans agreed to support whoever eventually becomes the nominee and fights the general election in November .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , whose campaign had pushed the â€œ#nevertrumpâ€ � hashtag and attacked Trump as â€œa con artistâ€ � , firmly committed for the first time to support the real estate mogul if â€ “ as seems likely â€ “ he becomes the Republican partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
The Florida senator said of the two Democratic alternatives Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton , â€œone is a socialist and the other is under investigationâ€ � , a reference to the ongoing controversy over the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s private email server .
Both Ohio governor John Kasich and Texas senator Ted Cruz agreed with Rubio that they would back Trump if he was the nominee .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign later sought to downplay the significance of the senatorâ€ ™ s pledge to support Trump if he were the nominee , insisting such a scenario simply wouldnâ€ ™ t become a reality .
â€œWe continue to believe Donald Trump will not be the nominee , â€ �
Todd Harris , a senior advisor to Rubio , told the Guardian in the â€œspin roomâ€ � .
â€œIf Santa Claus were to appear in my house tonight , I would welcome him in and give him some milk and cookies .
But itâ€ ™ s probably not going to happen.â€
�
The only interruption to the bickering were sporadic interventions by Ohio governor John Kasich , who in the absence of Jeb Bush assumed the role of party elder .
But his repeated attempts to stay above the fray rung largely incongruous throughout the event , despite his being joined by Cruz who appealed to the audience at home : â€œIs
this the debate you want playing out in the general election?â€
� While not as aggressive as Rubio in his attacks on Trump , Cruz did , however , team up with his Senate colleague to portray the reality TV star as essentially putting on a show on his signature issue : immigration and border security .
The two senators repeatedly criticized Trump over reports that he had said he was â€œflexibleâ€ � on the issue of illegal immigration during an off - the - record discussion with the New York Times .
The frontrunner , who has made building a wall along the Mexican border and making Mexico pay for it a cornerstone of his campaign , insisted it was unfair to reveal what was discussed in an off - the - record setting .
â€œI think being off the record is a very important thing .
I think itâ€ ™ s a very , very powerful thing , â€ � said Trump , who has forcefully called for new libel laws to sue media companies .
But the businessman made clear there was room for compromise in a future Trump administration .
â€œI will say , though , in terms of immigration â€ “ and almost anything else â€ “ there always has to be some , you know , tug and pull and deal , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never seen a very successful person who wasnâ€ ™ t flexible ...
You have to be flexible , because you learn.â€ � Fox Newsâ€ ™ s moderators gave Trumpâ€ ™ s policy positions even more scrutiny than in the past .
Chris Wallace displayed a graphic which showed the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s fuzzy math on his proposals to reduce the federal budget and Megyn Kelly quizzed him on his flip flops on increasing H-1B visas for highly educated workers .
â€œIâ€ ™ m changing .
Iâ€
™ m changing , â€ � the frontrunner told Kelly in response .
â€œWe need highly skilled people in this country , and if we canâ€ ™ t do it , weâ€ ™ ll get them in.â€
�
The statement not only contradicted a policy paper on his website , which states an increase in the visas â€œwould decimate women and minoritiesâ€ � , but also the long held policy positions of Senator Jeff Sessions , who was named on Thursday as the chairman of Trumpâ€ ™ s National Security Campaign Advisory Commission .
Despite their best efforts , it remained unclear whether either Rubio or Cruz had managed to create a dent in Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy .
They at times faded into the background , and in other moments struck a patronising tone .
â€œBreathe , breathe , breathe ,
â€ �
Cruz told Trump at one point .
â€œI know
itâ€ ™ s
hard.â€ �
Rubio appeared to get beneath Trumpâ€ ™ s skin with his relentless takedown of Trump University , highlighting the stories of students who he said had been victims of a scam , and a preference for foreign workers over Americans .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re making your clothes overseas , and youâ€ ™ re hiring your workers overseas , â€ � Rubio said .
A visibly angry Trump charged back by belittling his opponent , referring to Rubio as â€œthis little guyâ€ � and dubbing him an absentee senator â€ “ but seldom responding to the essence of the charge .
A brief respite to the back - and - forth arrived roughly 90 minutes into the debate , with local questions pertaining to the water crisis in Flint and Detroitâ€ ™ s bankruptcy .
But this resembled more lip service than a nuanced discussion of the problems plaguing the minority communities living outside the halls of the debate .
Rubio , when asked why Republican candidates had devoted no time to Flintâ€ ™ s lead - contaminated water crisis , expressed dismay that Democrats had â€œpoliticizedâ€ � the issue and commended Michigan Republican governor Rick Snyderâ€ ™ s response .
â€œHe took responsibility for what happened , â€ � Rubio said .
Dozens of protesters outside the arena disagreed , marching with signs that read : â€œFlint lives matter.â€ �
And Clinton responded swiftly on Twitter :
Trump also faced scrutiny over his foreign policy record .
He cited conspiracy theories about 9/11 while insisting that the military would obey any orders he gave to torture terrorists in US custody .
â€œThey wonâ€ ™ t refuse .
Theyâ€ ™ re not going to refuse me .
Believe me , â€ � the Republican frontrunner said .
And , with Trump winning 11 of the first 15 states and leading in polls in most of the upcoming contests , it looks increasingly likely he may be in the position to give those orders ."
2016-03-04,"This is the game we play after every Republican debate : the mainstream press corps finds some tortured explanation for why Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz won , and then days later Donald Trump rises in the polls .
In a night where CNN ran a headline reading â€œDonald
Trump defends size of his penisâ€ � , the man has probably won yet again .
Any doubt of Trumpâ€ ™ s tenacity was dispelled by the live crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference , a ballroom full of establishment Republicans watching the combat on giant projection screens , and laughing with He Of The Dyson Airbladed Hair in spite of themselves .
The media has only lately come round to the notion that perhaps its political Geiger counter is no longer detecting radiation but screaming a New York tune like Lou Reedâ€ ™ s Metal Machine Music .
But the revolutionary act of admitting that you can be wrong does not get you all the way to being right .
And it will be incredibly tempting for the same wisdom to hand this night to Cruz or Rubio .
Both candidates battered Trump repeatedly and well , according to the conventional political rules of debates .
They even tag - teamed Trump on a couple lines .
But the old logic has failed us .
We are not the same political people anymore , no longer bounded to conventional metaphysics .
Maybe it is no longer possible to die .
For every argument that should make sense , it is easy to proffer an immediate Trumpian counterpoint .
Cruz and Rubio alley - ooped mockery of him ?
Under normal circumstances , thatâ€ ™ s just the two responsible candidates beating down a punk .
Now , every Trump voter sees two congenital wusses who can only win by teaming up , two loser would - be antagonists so weak that even their insults need a partnership .
Even Fox News itself appeared to drop a lead weight on the scale to give this one to Cruz , the only viable remaining Not Trump candidate .
When the audience applauded Cruz , Fox cut to cheers .
When Trump got booed , they cut to those as well .
See , it seemed to say , you know which way this is going .
Fox even demanded that Trump explain how his own absurd tax - cut giveaway to the wealthy is going to correct the federal debt , as well as account for how his prescription drug plan will save taxpayers money while covering all Americans who qualify .
Thatâ€ ™ s just how far these people have gone on beyond zebra .
After a quarter century of allowing any Republican candidate to generate any trillion - dollar figure by throwing 13 dice in the air and counting whatever numbers appeared â€ “ after allowing eight years of â€œrepeal and replace Obamacareâ€ � without giving a tinkerâ€ ™ s damn about what the â€œreplaceâ€ � part looked like ( if it even existed at all ) â€ “ a conservative outlet demanded that a conservative explain how supply - side economics works , do something that looked like math and provide a plan that makes sense .
You know the instruments of the right are losing when they have to move left to correct themselves .
Again , it probably wonâ€ ™ t work .
For that , you just had to look at the audience at ground zero of the conservative movement .
People donâ€
™ t attend CPAC on a lark .
It costs $ 300 to register , and the expensive hotels near where the event is held usually run over $ 200 per night .
Thatâ€ ™ s $ 700 just to walk around conference rooms with a lanyard , pressed khakis and a titanic sense of entitlement to American hegemony .
These people were not Trump fans .
As the Fox moderators introduced each candidate , the cheers followed their status within acceptable conservatism .
John Kasich , the candidate running on the Sensible Stepdad platform , complete with flagrant lack of intolerance for gays and their ilk , received scattered cheers .
Trump garnered healthy applause and some boos .
Cruz received an even larger cheer and some boos as well .
The room erupted for Marco Rubio , the Ken doll avatar of CPAC crushes .
And yet Trump won them over , time and again .
Rubio had made jokes about his penis over the last week , and Trump just said : â€œItâ€ ™ s never been a problemâ€ � â€ “ and the entire room nearly whooped like a daytime talkshow audience .
Cruz burned him , and he burned back , and they cheered .
Rubio came after him , and they cheered .
Not everyone applauded Trump , but the volume of the laughs and clapping and did he just do that ?
moments was enough to overcome even the most ingrained institutional dislike .
Even in an audience pre - selected by cost and orthodoxy to oppose him .
If Trump could win points there , just imagine what happened among the people who have no fealty to movement conservatism , who have nurtured a sustained rage at being betrayed or ignored by its bromides , who have been told that conservatism is good for them even as they have seen the middle class begin to crater around them like a suburban Florida neighborhood pockmarking with sinkholes during a long drought .
If Donald Trump can win in enemy territory , consider just how much he succeeded among the villagers living in the crumbling outposts that conservatism has long abandoned ."
2016-03-04,"House of Cards has never felt like the real presidency : Frank Underwood is evil incarnate , bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains .
But now that , in real life , weâ€ ™ re in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race , his machinations are starting to look almost viable .
There are several parallels between Underwoodâ€ ™ s re - election campaign and what is currently playing out between Donald Trump , Ted Cruz , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .
Season four of the Netflix political soap , which starts on Friday , finds Underwood angling for the Democratic nomination for president .
Heâ€ ™ s running against Heather Dunbar , a determined woman who has never held elected office .
She is independently wealthy and funding her own campaign with her familyâ€ ™ s money .
Essentially , she is Trump and Clinton combined .
( Warning : light spoilers ahead . )
But the biggest similarity between House of Cards and real life is a billboard linking Underwood to the Ku Klux Klan , which has the potential to derail his campaign .
There is no way the showâ€ ™ s writers could have imagined that Trump would have his own problems with the KKK in his election bid .
Claire Underwood , who is estranged from Frank as the season begins , is working on her own political ambitions , starting with a run for Congress .
It is reminiscent of the path Hillary Clinton took decades ago after Billâ€ ™ s presidency came to a close .
Even Claireâ€ ™ s failed attempt to become a UN delegate mirrors Hillaryâ€ ™ s failure to overhaul the healthcare system while her husband was in office .
Barack Obama has said that none of the Republican candidates could handle Putin .
And the show features a bellicose Russian president , who has taken to â€œdisappearingâ€ � wealthy enemies , and who hovers over the turbulent foreign policy of Underwoodâ€ ™ s administration â€ “ he is asked constantly on the campaign trail how he plans to deal with such a man .
The show gets many of the particulars spot on , but there is still plenty it gets wrong .
In the fictional US , Underwoodâ€ ™ s biggest campaign problems are that unemployment is still running rampant and that gas prices are hovering close to $ 6 a gallon .
Neither of those are currently real - world issues , with the US unemployment rate low and fuel prices just as low .
But itâ€ ™ s immaterial whether the minutiae match up , because there is something fundamental about this season that weâ€ ™ re seeing play out in the horse race to Pennsylvania Avenue .
Previously , Frank and Claire collaborated to crush their weaker enemies .
But now , Frank and Claire are taking each other on â€ “ and both are playing for keeps .
Season four is all about fighting dirty .
Yes , Frank has to deal with the KKK connection , but Claire is the one that leaked it as payback for him tanking her political aspirations .
Itâ€ ™ s also about worthy opponents , as Underwood â€ “ representing the establishment â€ “ has to fend off attacks from Washington upstarts and outsiders .
The same is true for Hillary Clinton , who seemed as if she would stroll into a Democratic nomination until Bernie Sanders picked up steam .
A year ago it was impossible that she would meet her match , until she did â€
“ and he was an outsider , a gun - hating socialist atheist Jew .
Itâ€ ™ s the same on the Republican side , where Trump was ridiculed as an inexperienced outsider until people seemed to start liking that about him .
Heâ€
™ s proven a match for everything his party could throw at him : not only is he a worthy opponent
but , much like Claire , he is an underestimated one .
That is the brilliance of this season of House of Cards .
While it contains plot points that are divorced from reality , real life is baked into the drama .
Something drastic happens in the fourth episode , and it is so ludicrous that it strains credulity .
But is it any more outlandish than a former tabloid fixture and reality TV host , whose idea of foreign policy is banning Muslims and building a wall along the Mexican border , taking the White House ?"

Trump calls Rubio â€œlittle Marcoâ€ � ; Chris Wallace live fact - checks Trump .
We havenâ€ ™ t had much opportunity tonight to jump into the comments .
Letâ€

Itâ€ ™ s proper to fist bump after a debate , everybody knows that .
Update :
Rubio was hoarse .
Looks like he was trying to keep his germs to himself .
Stand - up guy .
Rubio is taking some heat from the # nevertrumpâ€ ™ s on the right for saying he would support Trump if Trump is the nominee .
Thatâ€ ™ s it .
There is some generally milling on the stage and oh look
thereâ€ ™ s
Bill Oâ€ ™
Reilly again .
Heâ€ ™ s interviewing Trump .
Trump says the debate was â€œtough but fair.â€ � Eric Trump and Melania Trump appear silently and straight - faced behind Trump like ... props ?
Trump calls Romney jealous .
He says he did not have the â€œguts to runâ€ � for president and heâ€ ™ s a joke artist .
More on Romney .
Why do you fill them with loathing ?
â€œIâ€
™ m loved , â€ � Trump says .
Kasich :
Progress in Ohio .
Rehabilitated minority community .
Iâ€ ™ ll fix Washington .
Iâ€ ™ ll send you power to fix your communities .
Restore America .
Rubio :
Unusual election cycle
huh .
This is about opportunities .
21st century
wow .
Our children .
Freedom .
Prosperity .
MarcoRubio.com Cruz : I want to talk to soldier , sailor , airmen , marine , and families .
Obama does not believe in you .
That will end .
And to the cops and firemen : I got your back .
Trump : Iâ€ ™ ll bring jobs back .
Fix military .
Care for vets .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re going to be very very proud of this country in just a few years.â€ �
Last question of the night :
Will you support the GOP nominee even if itâ€ ™ s
Trump ?
Rubio : Iâ€ ™ ll support the Republican nominee , even Trump , because the Democrats have two people left in the race .
A socialist and a person who lies to the families of the victims of Benghazi .
Cruz :
Yes , because I gave my word that I would .
I keep my word .
Kasich :
Yeah , I kinda think before itâ€ ™ s all said and done , Iâ€ ™ ll be the nominee .
Look , when youâ€ ™ re in the arena , you enter a special circle .
If he ends up as the nominee .
Sometimes he makes it a little bit hard
but you know Iâ€ ™ m going to support whoever is the nominee .
Trump is asked would he support the nominee even if itâ€ ™ s not him .
Trump :
Even if itâ€ ™ s not me ?
Millions of millions of people have come to the Republican party ... and Democrats are losing people .
Iâ€ ™ m very proud .
The answer is yes I will .
Maybe there has been a gentlemenâ€ ™ s agreement in place during this GOP debate .
Tonight , Cruz and Rubio have attacked Trump , sometime very successfully .
Trump has been on the defensive most of the night .
Meanwhile , Kasich has presented himself very well .
His foreign policy answer was superlative .
Could it be that Cruz and Rubio are trying to put Kasich out front ?
I canâ€
™ t imagine a selfless Cruz , but maybe .
Last commercial break !
Letâ€ ™ s hear it
â€ “ whoâ€ ™ s
winning and whoâ€ ™ s losing ?
Kasich takes a question about a commercial his campaign ran tying Trump to Putin .
Do you think Trump is naive about Putin ?
â€œIâ€
™ m not biting , â€ � Kasich says .
â€œLet me just take you around the world , â€ � he says .
Heâ€ ™ s cheered and applauded .
He goes around the world : Russia : attack on Eastern European Nato member states is attack on us .
China : stop hacking us and pipe down in south China sea .
Egypt : they are on last legs .
Jordan , Saudi , Gulf states : our allies who need support .
Annnd ... â€œWe need good human intelligence.â€
�
Ding ding ding .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s call it a semi - trip around the world , â€ � Kasich says .
He has run out of time .
Someone like Ted Cruz , who is constitutionally incapable of exhibiting any emotions other than affected unctuousness or smug paternalism , should probably avoid coming across like a father on stage .
I mean , leave aside all the creeping discomfort of Ted Cruz reminding you of someoneâ€ ™ s daddy ; itâ€ ™ s just unbearably smug .
Telling Donald Trump to breathe and count to 10 and behave like an adult is just such a weasel reaction .
For one , Cruz has been just as much of a petulant child as anyone else not named Bush , Carson or Kasich over the course of the debates .
For another , itâ€ ™ s like trying to sneak a burn in through the backdoor of the discourse .
Ted Cruz loses when he tries to attack Trump head on , so heâ€ ™ s going to passively attack him by portraying him as a child and showing how much wiser he is for refusing to engage .
But Cruz is engaging , while trying to seem above the same inane slapfight he regularly engages .
Once you get past the superficial shaming , heâ€ ™ s either a hypocrite or a wuss or , more realistically , both .
Rubioâ€ ™ s invited to say why he thinks Trumpâ€ ™ s not qualified to be president .
Rubio says Trump hasnâ€ ™ t shown seriousness about foreign policy .
Rubio cites Trumpâ€ ™ s earlier answer about the military doing whatever he says
even if itâ€ ™ s extra - legal .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s just not true , â€ � Rubio says .
Trump has not shown â€œthe intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these complicated issues , â€ � Rubio says .
Trumpâ€ ™ s reply : â€œIâ€ ™ ve gotten to know Marco .
Believe me , he is not a leader.â€ � â€œFrankly , when I say theyâ€ ™ ll do as I tell them , theyâ€ ™ ll do as I tell them.â€
�
Rubio says Trump once again was pressed on a policy issue and could only attack someone by name .
Then he lists pressure from North Korea , China , Russia , Iran and radical jihadists .
â€œYou have yet to answer a serious question about any of this , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œPutin said very nice things about me , â€ �
Trump says .
Then he says he had said , â€œWouldnâ€ ™ t
it be nice if we got along with the world and maybe Russia could help us?â€
�
Here is Trump on targetting terroristsâ€ ™ families : And hereâ€ ™ s the second 15 minutes of the debate : As the candidates discussed gun control , they began to get more detail focused .
Donald Trump has said that he does not support the ban on assault weapons .
In December , we investigated the 20 shootings with the most fatalities in 2015 and found that most gunmen obtain their weapons legally .
More specifically , we found that in three of those shootings , assault weapons had been used .
Oh come now .
This is a bit histrionic .
Right ?
Cruz hits Trump on guns , guns , guns for everyone , and Trump gets peppy and tries to interrupt .
â€œBreathe , breathe , breathe , you can do it .
I know itâ€ ™
s hard , â€ � Cruz says .
Rubio : â€œWhen theyâ€ ™ re done with yoga , can I [ say something]?â€
�
Cruz : â€œI really hope we donâ€ ™ t see yoga on this stage.â€ � â€œWell heâ€ ™ s very flexible , â€ � Rubio says , pointing to Trump .
Good one !
Joke of the night !
Q for Rubio
: late justice Scalia said the second amendment was not limitless â€ “
so , what limits would draw around the second amendment ?
As few as possible , Rubio says .
He slips in that he personally owns a gun .
â€œGun laws are not effective , â€ � he says .
â€œWe will protect the second amendment.â€ �
Trump agrees : â€œIâ€ ™ m a big defender of the second amendment.â€ �
Then he says â€œmany people will be dying in additionâ€ � from the 13 November Paris attacks .
Four months later ?
Trump is pushed on past support for an assault weapons ban : â€œI donâ€ ™ t support it any more .
I do not support the ban on assault.â€
�
This was Cruzâ€ ™ s attack on Donald Trump over his hiring practices earlier : Social issues .
Kasich is asked about saying that a cupcake maker should probably have to sell cupcakes for a same - sex marriage ceremony even if the maker objects .
Now Kasich :
â€œIf they ask you to participate in something you really donâ€ ™ t like , thatâ€ ™ s
another issue.â€ �
Kasich says he does not agree with Supreme Court protections for same - sex marriage .
â€œI believe in traditional marriage , between man and a woman.â€ �
Then he says something about everybody respecting one anotherâ€ ™ s differences and loving one another .
As long as theyâ€ ™ re not same - sex married ?
Q for Cruz :
Can a gay couple adopt ?
Cruz says leave it to the states .
Adoption and marriage should be up to the states .
He attacks the Supreme court protection of same - sex marriage .
â€œI generally speaking agree with what he said , â€ �
Trump says .
He seems subdued , not having spoken much in the last ten minutes .
A substantial portion of the CPAC audience missed the last segment of the GOP debate due to the emcees announcing last call over the PA .
I met a cheerful Trump voter in line , a young man perhaps a biscuit over 21 , wearing a â€œMake America
Great Againâ€ � hat backward .
He said that people have been giving him a â€œright onâ€
� quite sincerely all day .
The room let out a huge â€œwhoooooaaaaaaaâ€ � when Cruz shut down Trump with his â€œcount to 10â€ � line .
Things are getting louder .
Booze is flowing ,
thereâ€ ™ s quite a bit of yelling .
This is basically a Springer audience at this point .
It might be for the best that the alcohol has been cut off : many of these people certainly look , smell and totter like they pre - gamed at one of the many nearby surrounding restaurants .
There could have been a spontaneous white gang rumble otherwise .
Lots of snapping and moving in lines down the aisles , menacingly .
All it needs is a spark .
Iâ€ ™ m considering throwing a can into the crowd and shouting a candidateâ€ ™ s name to see if it sets something off .
If something happens , know we all had it coming .
Question about the collapse of manufacturing in Detroit , for Cruz .
What would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train people to do the jobs ?
Cruz says â€œDetroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of left - wing policy.â€ �
He goes back to Henry Ford and WWII .
â€œAnd then for 50 years , left - wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies , weak crime policies , and have driven the residents out.â€ � Itâ€ ™ s all the leftâ€ ™ s fault .
No such thing as an international market for cars .
Cruz says he would lift regulations : Obamacare , the EPA and other regulators .
And his VAT tax plan is a manufacturing magnet , he says .
Kasich is asked about Detroit schools , which are in debt and could go bankrupt .
Should the government bail out the schools .
Kasich compares the situation to Cleveland , where â€œschools are coming back because of a major overhaul.â€ � â€œFixing schools rests at the state and local level and particularly at the school board level.â€
�
He could talk forever about this .
Heâ€ ™ s on to vocational education and vouchers .
â€œWe as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods and our communities for our children and their educations.â€
�
â€œThe people of this town are gon na rise and they need to be
involved.â€ �
Cheers in the hall .
Theyâ€ ™ re back .
Itâ€ ™ s a question about government neglect and poisonous water in Flint , Michigan , not far from the debate tonight .
Rubio is asked about infrastructure improvement .
What can be done ?
â€œWhat happened in Flint was a terrible thing .
It was a systemic breakdown at every level of government.â€ � Rubio is applauded for saying â€œthe politicizing of it is unfair.â€ �
â€œThis should not be a partisan issue ... all of us are outraged .
.. It is a proper role for the federal government to play at the local level.â€ �
Here is Trump talking about the â€œoff the recordâ€ � immigration comments :
And this oneâ€ ™ s the first 15 minutes : How bad were those Trump lines : â€œLetâ€ ™
s see what happens at the end of three years ,
â€ �
and : â€œItâ€ ™ s
a minor civil case!â€
�
Itâ€ ™ s true that the CNN poll they have been discussing put a range of hypothetical questions to respondents ( very hypothetical ; the February poll was about the November general election ) but the difference between Cruz and Trump in a race with Clinton isnâ€ ™ t really anything to brag about ..
The poll showed that in a race between Cruz and Clinton , Cruz would win 49%-48 % ( remember , these polls have a margin of error - the numbers could be 3 percentage points higher or lower ) .
When respondents were given the choice between Trump and Clinton , they chose Clinton 52%-44 % .
Hereâ€ ™ s another commercial break .
How bruised do you see Trump as being after that grilling over his university ?
Which attack was more effective â€ “ Rubio saying Trump was trying to do to the American people what he did to the students â€ “ or Cruz asking voters if this is the conversation they want to see in the general election ?
Trump seemed a little cornered in that exchange over Trump University .
It ended with him citing the polls .
My polls are bigger than yours .
Kasich gets the mic and he says â€œthere are a lot of people yearning for someone who is going to bring America backâ€ � .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s stop fighting!â€
� Kasich says .
A robust cheer .
Rubio : â€œI spoke to one of the victims yesterday ...
They signed up for this course ...
they paid $ 15,000 ...
Then they had to pay even more money ...
When they realized what a scam it was , â€ � they asked for a refund and could not get one , he says .
â€œWe will see whoâ€ ™ s right at the end of a few years ,
â€ �
Trump says .
He says almost all of the people who signed up said it was terrific .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s see what happens at the end of three years.â€ �
Then Trump says the school gave refunds to people .
Rubio : â€œWhat heâ€ ™ s trying to do to the American people , what he did to the people who signed up for this course ...
heâ€
™ s trying to con people into giving him their vote , just like he conned people into giving him their money.â€ �
Trump hits back that Rubio is absent from the Senate and the people of Florida â€œwouldnâ€ ™ t elect him dog catcherâ€ � .
Cruz jumps in for the kill :
â€œLet me just ask the voters at home .
Is this the debate you want?â€
� â€œIf we nominate Donald , weâ€ ™ re going to spend the summer and fall with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a minor civil case ,
â€ �
Trump fumes .
Cruz : â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got to learn not to interrupt .
Count to ten , Donald .
Count to ten.â€ � Politifact has examined Trumpâ€ ™ s claim ( also made before tonight ) that Trump University was given an A by the Better Business Bureau , which reviews businesses .
Trump said about his entrepreneur institute that â€œwe have an â€˜Aâ€ ™ from the Better Business Bureau.â€ �
Literally speaking , that is inaccurate .
The Better Business Bureau gives the program no rating today because itâ€ ™ s no longer a going concern .
Trump University had an A at some point .
The Better Business Bureau doesnâ€ ™ t release details of its past ratings , but it did say Trumpâ€ ™ s program had ratings that ranged from A+ to D- .
What we do know , from several published reports and archived Web pages , is that the university had a D in 2010 .
Trumpâ€ ™ s claim is literally wrong and also ignores the universityâ€ ™ s lower Better Business Bureau scores .
We rate it False .
Rubio jumps in and attacks Trump on Trump University , which faces fraud accusations and a class action lawsuit .
He says the school hired a manager at Buffalo Wild Wings despite Trumpâ€ ™ s promise to hire the best .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re willing to say whatever you have to say to get them to give them your money , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œWe have a 98 % approval rating , we have an A from the Better Business Bureau and people like it ,
â€ �
Trump says .
Kelly clarifies : â€œThe rating from the BBB was a D- and it was a result of a number of complaints they received.â€ � â€œIt was elevated to an A , â€ �
Trump says .
Not on the public record , she sys .
Kelly says â€œthereâ€ ™ s a class action of 5,000 peopleâ€ � who say they were fleeced .
Kelly points out that these are â€œworking classâ€ � people .
â€œThe lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it was so bad for her ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œYou counter - sued her ,
â€ �
Kelly said , and you had to pay her legal fees .
Kelly is hammering him on it .
She puts up a court document that says , â€œThe victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize that they have been fleeced.â€ � â€œLetâ€ ™
s see what happens in court , â€ � Trump says .
Kasich jumps in and says people are frustrated because politicians just tell them what they want to hear .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s getting in the hearts and souls of people is they want change , â€ � Kasich says .
â€œPeople are getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick someone with a record of achievement , not just talk.â€ �
Hillary Clinton doesnâ€ ™ t seem totally convinced by Trumpâ€ ™ s performance this evening :
Kelly to Trump
: People believe you tell it like it is .
But you reverse yourself and here are three video examples !
She runs the video reel .
First on war in Afghanistan : Trump said â€œwe made a mistakeâ€ � getting involved ; but then he denies ever having said it .
On Syrian refugees : Trump says you have to accept refugees â€œon a humanitarian basisâ€ � .
Then later he says â€œwe have our own problemsâ€ �
so no .
On Bush lying to get the US into the Iraq war .
â€œThey lied , â€ �
Trump says .
Later : â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if they lied , youâ€ ™ d have to ask them.â€ � Trump says on Afghanistan that when he said Afghanistan he meant Iraq .
He says he was just correcting himself .
Confusing answer .
On Syrian refugees , he says the first time he took the question was early on and he heard the number was small .
But then when he understood the flow was larger , â€œI changed my tuneâ€ � .
Kelly challenges him : You seem to change your tune so much , whereâ€ ™ s your core ?
Iâ€ ™ ve never seen a successful person who wasnâ€ ™ t flexible , who didnâ€ ™ t have a certain degree of flexibility ...
You have to be flexible , because you learn .
Hereâ€ ™ s a look at where things stand halfway through the debate : Trump is still winning .
Kasich is the strongest , most impressive .
Rubio is the gadfly .
Cruz is the nit not worth picking .
Two more clips from the debate so far : Theyâ€ ™ re back .
Thereâ€ ™ s another commercial break .
Give us your report card .
Letter grades or number grades , your preference .
Cruz gets a question about his saying once that he was open to the possibility that Edward Snowden had done a public service by exposing government surveillance .
Cruz runs away from that position with his hair on fire .
Cruz says the news of massive surveillance was a very troubling development .
But the evidence at the time was unclear .
Now , â€œthe evidence is clearâ€ � that not only did Snowden violate the law
but he likely committed treason , Cruz said .
Cruz outdoes himself demonstrating how much he dislikes Snowden .
Trump on Snowden : â€œI said from the beginning , he was a spy and we need to get him back.â€ �
Kasich says a Foreign Policy magazine survey on who would be best at foreign policy as president gave him 55 % of the vote .
Trump takes a question about an open letter from military leaders and intelligence figures including Michael Hayden warning that the military would refuse to carry out a President Trumpâ€ ™ s order to torture terror suspects .
â€œThey wonâ€
™ t refuse .
Theyâ€ ™ re not going to refuse me .
Believe me , â€ �
Trump says .
Then he says â€œwe should go waterboarding and we go tougher.â€ �
He refers to â€œthese animals over in the Middle East chopping off headsâ€ � .
Trump is pressed on whether the military could follow his potentially extra - legal orders to kill a terroristâ€ ™ s family .
[ the description of this question has been corrected . ]
â€œIâ€ ™ m a leader ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œIf I say do it , theyâ€ ™ re going to do it , thatâ€ ™ s what leadership is
about.â€ �
Rick Santorum is LIVE in The Octagon here at CPAC during the break !
He claims that he took a test that was supposed to show who he should , as a voter , side with .
It turned out that he sided with Rubio more than he did with himself !
Endorsing Rubio was only the next logical step .
He then moves on to explaining how Rubio has been endorsed by the American Conservatives Union .
This speech is , bluntly speaking , not moving the needle very far .
People are booing .
Santorum is trying to amp up the crowd , and the divisions within it are just too big .
Then , perhaps sensing that there is no problem with the mood he can not make worse , he does this :
Santorum : I was at a funeral two weeks ago .
CPAC aide :
Sir , we do have to get back to the debate .
The hyped rematch between Megyn Kelly and Donald Trump fizzles out .
So far .
Why is Trump being so polite ?
Maybe because heâ€ ™ s trying to be polite to women .
After all , Hillary Clinton is ahead .
In an 18 February poll , she beats him in a match - up .
â€œDonald , you could resolve this issue very easily by simply releasing the New York Times tapes.â€ � Theyâ€ ™ re now all operating on the assumption that the tapes exist .
â€œIf in fact you went to Manhattan and said ,
â€˜Iâ€ ™ m lying to the American people , â€ ™ the people have a right to know , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re the liar , â€ � Trump says .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve given my answer , lyinâ€
™
Ted.â€ �
Here are Trump and Rubio arguing over immigration earlier :
Rubio and Cruz attack Trump over a New York Times report that more than 300 Americans applied to Trumpâ€ ™ s Palm Beach Florida club , Mar - a - Lago , but only 17 were hired and other positions were filled by immigrants Trump says heâ€ ™ s had tens of thousands of people working for him .
He says the Mar - a Lago club has a November through March season .
â€œPeople donâ€ ™ t want a short - term job ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œSo we will bring people in , we bring them out.â€ �
Cruz hits him with a question for the audience : â€œHow many people here have worked as a waiter or a waitress?â€ � he asks .
Lots of applause .
â€œMarcoâ€ ™ s
dad started as a bartender , mine started washing dishes.â€ �
Cruz is starting a refrain : â€œRelease the tapes.â€
�
â€œThis is all just rhetoric for the voters ... simply release the tape .
His record right now ... is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens.â€ � Theyâ€ ™ re back .
Trump is challenged again , on his changing views about admitting highly skilled workers .
His web site says the practice is wrong , but in a recent debate he said it was OK .
â€œIâ€
™ m changing , â€ � Trump says .
â€œWe need highly skilled people in this country .
And if we canâ€ ™ t do it
, weâ€ ™ ll bring them in .
â€œIâ€
™ m changing it , and Iâ€ ™ m softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.â€ �
Kelly points out that the Art of the Deal â€ “ Trumpâ€ ™ s book â€ “ talks about the power of â€œPlaying to peopleâ€ ™ s fantasies.â€ �
Is that what Trump is doing here ?
â€œIâ€ ™ m not playing to anybodyâ€ ™ s fantasies , â€ �
he says .
They are talking immigration now and itâ€ ™ s an issue that is intimately tied to the economy in the minds of many voters ( and , perhaps not coincidentally , in Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s rhetoric too ) .
A report from Pew in September last year found that 50 % of US adults believe immigrants to the US are making things worse for economy while 28 % say they think immigrants improve the economy .
Thereâ€ ™ s a commercial break .
Whereâ€ ™ s everybody at with this debate so far ?
Rubioâ€ ™ s attacking hard , especially on Trumpâ€ ™ s lack of policy specificity â€ “ is it working ?
What about the Cruz attack on Trump writing checks to Hillary Clinton ?
Will Kasich pick up fans tonight ?
Kelly asks Trump about a BuzzFeed report that the NY Times has an audio recording of Trump admitting his seemingly rigid and hawkish stance on immigration is actually flexible .
Trump seems to admit the conversation and praises media interviewing rules
â€ “ rich for someone who has so forcefully called for new libel laws to sue media companies .
â€œI may have discussed something like that with the NYT .
But I would never have released off - the - record conversations .
I donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s fair , â€ � Trump says .
â€œMany of those things were off the record , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI take being off the record as a very important thing ...
and I would always honor that.â€ �
Heâ€ ™ s pressed on whether he would call for the release of tapes with the Times editors .
The answer : No
. â€œI would not do that .
I have too much respect for that process ...
I would not do that.â€
� â€œIn terms of immigration
, there always has to be some target ..
deal ...
you have to be able to have some flexibility .
Some negotiation , â€ � he says .
You can watch the debate live here : â€œIt was for business ,
â€ �
Trump says .
He says he does a lot of deals abroad , implying that he needs to grease the skids to do so .
He says he supported George W Bush and Reagan .
Then we get a Megyn Kelly vs. Trump moment :
Kelly :
Mr Trump .
Hi how are you ?
Trump :
Nice to be with you Megyn .
Youâ€ ™ re looking well .
Chris Wallaceâ€ ™ s use of graphics to fact - check Donald Trump is surprising â€ “ and hasnâ€ ™ t been the norm in past debates â€ “
but perhaps it should not be such a shock .
Trump is a slippery fish , and the graphics are a method of pinning him down .
Fact is , however , that Trump still wriggles , even when itâ€ ™ s abundantly clear his budget numbers are completely bonkers .
Immigration question .
Cruz is asked why Senator Sessions endorsed Trump .
â€œIf
you look to the actual record , â€ � Cruz says , heâ€
™ s the candidate to support for a tough immigration policy .
He accuses Trump of supporting Carter over Reagan , and Kerry over Bush .
â€œHe funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.â€
�
Cruz also says Trump supported five of the eight members of the Gang of 8 immigration reform crew .
Cruz says Trump wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton in 2008 .
â€œIt wasnâ€ ™ t for business.â€ �
The crowd watching the debate at CPAC is getting rowdier .
Someone yelled , â€œFuck
you , Trump!â€ � ( and , later , â€œ[semi - intelligible F - word usage ] , BITCHâ€ � in one of those stagily breathy yells that sound deliberately half - hearted , as if to gauge the audience .
It didnâ€ ™ t work ; the hostility didnâ€ ™ t move the needle .
Trump is moving the needle .
For a pro - Rubio crowd , Trump got howls and whoops for calling Rubio â€œlittle Marcoâ€ � .
He has a canny understanding for when abuse is funny , when puncturing seriousness seems cool and when to no - sell the assaults of his opponents .
Trump is winning a room that is institutionally designed to oppose him .
Also , Fox News is hilariously trying to make Trump explain how tax cuts can reduce the deficit , when conservative media has never demanded any viable mathematical explanation of the utter horse - pucky of supply - side economics at any point in the last generation .
Kasich takes a question about supporting raising the minimum wage .
Kasich said he never supported a federal minimum wage increase .
â€œIf states want to do it they ought to sit down .. and figure it out.â€ �
Then he says balancing the budget is â€œnot a theory for me.â€ �
As chairman of the budget committee Kasich secured the 1997 balanced budget act .
â€œI fought the entire Washington establishment and won , because when you balance a budget you must [ address ] every single thing.â€ �
He says you canâ€
™ t be a generalist and â€œyouâ€ ™ ve got ta take the heat.â€
�
Kasich is cheered .
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s claims that the US tax code has become more complex are hard to dispute .
In 1940 , the instruction manual for individual income tax returns was just two pages long .
In 2013 , it was 207 pages .
Trump says â€œas a businessmanâ€ �
he has to support both parties .
â€œWe need people to get along .
We need to be able to get things done.â€ �
Cruz is asked about abolishing the IRS .
He says people will file on postcards .
Then he attacks Trump for a lack of specificity in his policy prescriptions ... and calls him a Washington insider .
In between all of the insults , let me point out the specificity that was lacking ...
Itâ€ ™ s easy to say it , but one of the great disconnects ..
I understand the support for Donald ...
youâ€ ™ re angry . ..
But for 40 years , Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that youâ€ ™ re angry about.â€ �
By contributing to â€œliberal Democrats , â€ � Cruz means .
Trump is asked about his proposals to cut the deficit by cutting the education department and the EPA , with a combined $ 86bn budget .
But the deficit is $ 544bn per annum .
â€œYour numbers donâ€ ™ t add up , â€ �
Trump is told .
Trump argues that the government can renegotiate contracts with vendors .
Wallace , the moderator , doesnâ€ ™ t buy it , and continues to press , saying Trumpsâ€ ™ claim to save $ 300bn on Medicare is belied by the annual Medicare budget being only $ 80bn .
Trump insists â€œif
we properly
negotiateâ€ �
the money will be saved .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t do that , we donâ€ ™ t negotiate.â€
�
[ this post has been updated to correct budget figures ]
Trump responds .
â€œThis little guy has lied so much about my record ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œHere we go , â€ � Rubio says .
Boos , boos boos for Trump .
He says he did not inherit so much money as Rubio says .
He says he has built a magnificent company .
But how soon will he move his clothing manufacturing back to the USA ?
â€œI will do that and by the way I have been doing it more and more , â€ �
Trump says .
Lies , says Rubio .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not going to do it , â€ � Rubio says , because he can make more money manufacturing abroad .
Then Rubio sets off a nasty argument with Trump : â€œYou see what happens again when you ask him about a policy issue ?
The first thing he does is launch an attack.â€ �
Trump and Rubio talk over one another .
Rubio brings up Trump steaks .
Yell yell yell .
Big fight over whether Trump is a good businessman .
Wallace wants to ask a question about policy .
â€œHe wonâ€
™ t answer it , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œDonâ€ ™ t worry about little Marco , I will ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s hear it , Big Donald ,
â€ � Rubio says .
Boos boos boos .
Now the debate has turned to the economy - itâ€ ™ s a strong policy area for Trump and not just among Republicans .
A poll by CNN / ORC last month asked 1,001 respondents â€œregardless of whom you support , which one [ of the candidates ]
do you think would do the best job handling the economy?â€
�
Some 38 % of respondents chose Trump , 25 % said Clinton , 17 % Sanders and in fourth place with 5 % of respondents was Cruz .
Donald Trump says his hands are not small .
This is probably true .
The Washington Post has published a thorough investigation into this question .
It estimates that Trumpâ€ ™ s finger are 3.7 inches long , which appears in line with averages from other datasets .
Back to Rubio .
You call Trump a con artist .
But he employs thousands .
Question : How many jobs have you created ?
The question is jeered .
What a crowd .
Rubio says Trump inherited â€œover a hundred million dollarsâ€ � and lost it .
â€œHe can start tonight by declaring that all the Donald J Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and Mexico , â€ � Rubio says .
Heâ€
™ s definitely got a tired voice , but
heâ€ ™ s pounding through it .
Then he says that government does not create jobs .
He refers people to his web site .
Here is a clip of the â€œsmall
handsâ€ � moment :
Look : this is how supreme , unassailable confidence works .
People enjoy it .
This guy just brazenly lied about a joke thatâ€ ™ s been coming at his expense for 30 years and then owned and totally absorbed all the energy of a dick joke , then pushed it outward with a thunderous chi blast of â€œwhateverâ€
� .
Attacks over .
Done .
Forget it .
Thereâ€ ™ s no damn point .
Kasich is pressed about what path he has to a nomination .
He finished in single digits in most Super Tuesday states ( except Vermont , and Massachusetts ) .
Kasich said â€œyou all wrote me offâ€ � before .
â€œItâ€
™ s now March madness and weâ€ ™ re heading up north , to my turf .
And let me tell you this , I will win Ohio , â€ � Kasich says .
He says when people get to know him , theyâ€ ™ ll back him .
The spotlight goes to Kasich .
Itâ€ ™ s a question about whether he would work a cooperative strategy with other candidates to block Trump .
â€œThis is so much about process , it frankly is boring to me , â€ � Kasich says .
Then he says he beats Clinton by more than anybody , by 11 points .
â€œIn one poll , â€ � Trump interjects .
Kasich ignores him .
He says â€œI can get crossover votes.â€ � Kasich says people tell him â€œyou seem to be the adult on the stage , â€ � and that line is cheered .
Now a fight over polling .
â€œOf all the people on this stage he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œI
beat Hillary Clinton in many polls
, â€ � Trump says .
He mentions USA Today and Quinnipiac .
â€œI have not started on Hillary yet ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œBelieve me , I will start soon.â€ � Cheers .
Cruz gets a question and calls for a focus on issues that concern the average viewer .
Then he says heâ€ ™ s the only candidate to defeat Trump .
Trump replies that he is winning authoritatively .
Rubio says â€œtwo - thirds of the people who have cast a vote ... do not want you to be our nominee.â€ �
Then Rubio says that â€œweâ€ ™ re not going to turn over the conservative movementâ€ �
â€œto someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980s.â€ � Good one .
Trump groans .
Jeb Lund reports on the scene from CPAC as the debate picks up steam â€ “ less than 10 minutes in , and Trump has already made a â€œsmall hands ; small something - elseâ€ � joke : We are LIVE from the ballroom of the Conservative Political Action Conference .
These people were given chits for free drinks and warmed up by Sean Hannity .
They are ready to get ROWDY .
And from Trump to Cruz to Rubio , the crowd cheers only got LOUDER .
This is a hugely establishment crowd .
Rubio is asked about his attacks on Trump over his tan , his hands , and his maybe wanting to wet himself at the last debate .
Rubio : Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks ...
If thereâ€ ™ s anybody that ever deserved to be attacked that way ,
itâ€ ™ s Donald Trump .
Rubio is cheered - booed .
He sounds a bit hoarse .
He calls for a debate on the issues ( and blames the media ) .
Trump replies : â€œI also have called him a lightweight ... and I have to take that back.â€ �
Then Trump says Rubio â€œhit me on my hands ,
â€ � referring to Rubio picking up an old Graydon Carter criticism of Trump being a â€œshort - fingered vulgarian.â€ �
Trump holds up his hands .
â€œLook at those hands , â€ � he says .
Then he says Rubio implied that â€œif theyâ€ ™ re small , something else must be smallâ€ � .
Then Trump appears to boast about the size of his penis : I guarantee you
thereâ€
™ s no problem .
There is a huge protest going on , even as the debate kicks off , in the streets near the Detroit venue hosting it .
Protesters appear to be calling attention to the lead - laced water supply in Flint and the Michigan governorâ€ ™ s role in the public health debacle .
Other protesters are calling for a decent minimum wage of $ 15 an hour .
Television media might have told us more about the protests if not for Mitt Romney , though maybe not even then .
The former GOP presidential nominee gave a blistering speech Thursday morning attacking Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , calling him a con artist and fraud , and calling his supporters â€œsuckersâ€ � .
Thanks to his marquee speech , the media narrative of the day is Trump versus Mitt Romney and the Republican establishment .
In that match - up , thereâ€ ™ s little room for a redress of grievances .
Second question , about former KKK leader David Dukeâ€ ™ s support for Trump .
Trump : I totally disavow the KKK .
I totally disavow David Duke .
Iâ€ ™ ve been doing it now for two weeks . ...
Ultimately he got to the Ku Klux Klan , which obviously Iâ€ ™ m going to disavow ...
Take a look at my Twitter account .
First question for Trump , about Romneyâ€ ™ s attacks on him from this morning .
The mention of â€œRomneyâ€ � draws boos .
Trump :
He was a failed candidate , he should have beaten president Obama very easily , he failed miserably ...
Obviously he wants to be relevant , he wants to be back in the game .
Then Trump says he agrees with Romney on free trade , but â€œweâ€ ™ re getting crushedâ€ � â€ “ so Trump supports a tariff on Chinese goods , which is not free trade .
â€œWe will make great trade deals ,
â€ �
Trump says .
Heâ€ ™ s cheered .
Here come the moderators .
Megyn Kelly , Bret Baier and Chris Wallace .
The candidates are already on stage .
Left to right : Rubio , Trump , Cruz and Kasich .
Theyâ€ ™ re being introduced and all get cheers .
This crowd sounds ex - cited .
Check out that hall : More on that pilot who didnâ€
™ t work for Trump , ( Trump says ) , whether or not he , the pilot , was indeed a drug dealer ...
Hereâ€ ™ s the Rubio ad in question : Court documents via the Smoking Gun : If youâ€ ™ re just joining our debate live coverage â€ “ welcome !
Theyâ€ ™ re due to begin at 9 pm ET .
Currently thereâ€ ™ s a big protest staged by fast - food workers and â€œFight for $ 15â€ � supporters outside the debate hall in Detroit , Michigan .
Of the four candidates to take the stage tonight only John Kasich , the Ohio governor , has stated a willingness to entertain a minimum wage hike , if itâ€ ™ s â€œreasonable.â€ � Facing Kasich tonight will be Donald Trump , the talented politician ; Ted Cruz , the US senator from Texas ; and Marco Rubio , the US senator from Florida .
Yesterday Ben Carson said he wasnâ€ ™ t coming .
What to expect from this evening ?
Another round of pin - the - scandal - on - the - Trump .
Last time Rubio and Cruz hit the frontrunner with everything they had in an attempt to bring him down a notch .
Second timeâ€ ™ s a charm ?
Nora Ephron on
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s
psychology .
We havenâ€ ™ t seen this Rubio ad , but weâ€ ™ re going to find it .
Sounds spicy .
Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , who endorsed Donald Trump in advance of his stateâ€ ™ s Super Tuesday primary , will serve as Trumpâ€ ™ s top adviser on national security , the Trump camp has just announced .
Sessions is a longtime member of the armed services committee .
Itâ€ ™ s some pretty serious muscle for Trump , who has attracted little support from elected officials and won the support of zero other senators .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Sabrina Siddiqui is at the scene of the protest outside the debate at the Fox Theatre in Detroit :
As protesters outside the debate call for boosting the federal minimum wage to $ 15 an hour â€ “ up from its current $ 7.25 an hour
â€ “
hereâ€ ™ s where the candidates who will take the stage stand .
Theyâ€ ™ re all totally closed to the idea except Ohio governor John Kasich : Rubio : If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay , I would be all for it , but it isnâ€ ™ t .
In the 20th century , itâ€ ™ s a disaster .
Trump :
Weâ€ ™ re not going to be able to compete against the world .
I hate to say it , but we have to leave it the way it is .
People have to go out , they have to work really hard , and they have to get into that upper stratum .
But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world
, we just canâ€ ™ t do it .
Cruz :
Every time you raise the minimum wage , the people who are hurt the most is the most vulnerable .
Kasich :
Have it be reasonable ...
I wouldnâ€ ™ t get into numbers right now .
In protest of the Republican opposition to a minimum wage increase ( elaboration : John Kasich has supported a â€œreasonableâ€ � minimum wage increase , which the other candidates oppose ) , low - wage workers are staging a giant march outside the Fox Theatre in Detroit .
( Michiganâ€ ™ s primary is on 8 March . )
Hereâ€ ™ s a periscope view of the crowd .
Itâ€ ™ s big .
People are chanting , â€œWhose streets ?
Our streets !
Whose streets ?
Our streets!â€ � and â€œWhat do we want ?
$ 15 !
When do we want it ?
Now!â€ �
The protests is organized by the Fight for $ 15 group , which has sent this press material : As presidential candidates from both parties converge in Michigan less than one week before the stateâ€ ™ s primary , fast - food workers from Detroit and Flint who are demanding $ 15/hour and union rights announced they will walk off the job Thursday , and will join more than 1,000 underpaid workers to wage back - to - back protests outside the GOP and Democratic presidential debates in Michigan this week .
With a devastating water crisis continuing to unfold in Flint , fast - food workers from that city â€ “ who were among the first to join the Fight for $ 15 â€ “ will demand that presidential candidates from both parties support higher pay , union rights , and racial justice .
More than 46 % of workers in Michigan , or some 1.9 million , are paid less than $ 15/hour .
â€œThe politicians who are failing the people of Flint are no different than companies like McDonaldâ€ ™ s that are locking us in poverty â€ “ both are abusing their power , and both must be held accountable , â€ � said Tyrone Stitts , 43 , who lives in Flint , Mich. , and is paid $ 8.50/hour at Taco Bell . â€œFast - food and other workers in Flint will be not silent until we win $ 15/hour and union rights , and until elected leaders from both parties fight to make sure that all people have a fair shot regardless of what they look like or where they were
born.â€ �
A reader just emailed us saying â€œ11th debate ? !
How many more?!!!â€ �
- we know how you feel Peter .
According to the GOP debate schedule , we should be nearing the end with just two more officially RNC sanctioned debates to go .
Historically speaking , thatâ€ ™ s not so bad .
The chart below published by the University of Virginiaâ€ ™ s Center For Politics
shows that Republicans had 20 debates in 2012 .
And in 2008 , the two parties together notched up almost 40 .
Oof .
We asked you what youâ€ ™ d like in your pre - debate coverage , and we gather that none of you are warming up by watching Foxâ€ ™ s run - up coverage , Real Talk with Greta .
Anyway here are some of your preferences and ideas
: Discuss : Donald Trump and the Politics of Resentment
Would Republicans really nuke Trump ?
Could they ?
As part of any answer to these questions Iâ€ ™ d point out that pollsters who track generic Democrats versus generic Republicans find a mood close to right down the middle this cycle .
Even if the Republicans arrive at their nominee in an extremely messy way , it will still only be July ( probably ) and if the nominee is a big enough name , thereâ€ ™ s no reason to think he ( she ? ! ? ) would be beaten before beginning .
One caveat here is that contested conventions are rare â€ “ the recent precedent most people point to is the Democrats nominating Hubert Humphrey ( over George McGovern in a mess ) in 1968 â€ “ and anyone who assumes there will be one should read a piece such as this from Josh Marshall yesterday : â€œNo , there wonâ€ ™ t be a contested convention.â€ � Addendum : trust us ,
dear international viewer â€ “ this nomination process is plenty confusing right here in the good old USA .
Clinton investigations and Trump as commander - in - chief Weâ€ ™ re enjoying the conversation below the line on this one .
See here for the latest on the Pagliano immunity deal .
Why does everyone hate Cruz ?
Weâ€ ™ d start the list with the fact that he is disloyal , as when he attacked senate buddy Mike Leeâ€ ™ s criminal justice reform bill ; self - serving , as when he brought the senate to a halt to grandstand about â€œdefundingâ€ � Obamacare which was not going to happen ; underhanded , as when his campaign spread a rumor on Iowa caucus night that rival Ben Carson had dropped out of the race ; and a sophist , as when he wondered aloud whether Chuck Hagel was taking money from North Korea during the formerâ€ ™ s defense secretary confirmation process .
But read the Atlanticâ€ ™ s Molly Ball on this , â€œWhy DC hates Ted Cruzâ€ � .
Commenters :
What do you want to do with the next 95 minutes ?
Talk Super Tuesday , and whether Donald Trump didnâ€ ™ t actually do so well ?
Mitt Romney , and whether he has a secret plan to snatch the Republican nomination in a contested convention ?
Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s chances in Florida ?
Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ path to the nomination ?
A Trump - versus - Clinton general ?
Weâ€ ™ re assuming that most of you are reasonably caught up with the news - of - day in US presidential politics .
If not , you can get a quickie light roundup in todayâ€ ™ s Campaign Minute , an incremental real - time narration in my colleague Scott Bixbyâ€ ™ s live blog , or a full briefing delivered in news - story form and collected on our US politics page .
Former top Mitt Romney strategist Stuart Stevens has been going after Trump for saying that Romney begged him , Trump , for his endorsement in 2012 :
Update : from Romneyâ€ ™ s former body man :
Hereâ€ ™ s our news coverage of Romneyâ€ ™ s big attack this morning on Trump , in which he called Trump dangerous to the economy and national security , impugned Trumpâ€ ™ s intelligence and business acumen and direly warned that â€œthis is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyssâ€ � :
In other news , Bernie Sanders tamed his famous mane in Kansas , which caucuses Saturday :
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the umpteenth ( read : 11th ) Republican presidential debate .
There are only four candidates onstage tonight so it should be a quick one .
Kidding :
itâ€ ™ s scheduled to start at 9 pm and run for two hours .
Notably absent from tonightâ€ ™ s debate will be retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , who announced on Wednesday that he was rethinking his campaign after an underwhelming Super Tuesday performance ( four last places ; seven second - to - last places ) .
What we can count on is another two - pronged attack on frontrunner Donald Trump by the determined senatorial duo of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio .
Remember what happened last time ( summary here ) , just one week ago in Houston ?
Rubio accused Trump of repeating himself , Cruz tied Trump to Dennis Rodman and Trump called Cruz a â€œbasket caseâ€ � and a â€œliarâ€ � and said Rubio was a â€œchoke
artistâ€ � .
Who wouldnâ€ ™ t come back for more ?
Ben Carson , thatâ€ ™ s who .
Had he participated tonight , the surgeon would have enjoyed a home - court advantage : the debate will be held at the Fox Theatre ( thatâ€ ™ s how they spell it , the British way ) in Detroit , where Carson grew up and where he launched his campaign .
In the hall tonight for the Guardian will be Sabrina Siddiqui , backed by Ben Jacobs in Washington and a team of reporters and commentators here in New York and elsewhere .
Onstage tonight will be : Ted Cruz , US senator from Texas John Kasich , governor of Ohio Marco Rubio , US senator from Florida Donald Trump , leading vote - getter Fox News is hosting .
Of mild interest tonight is the fact that the moderators include Megyn Kelly , the Fox host who so rankles Trump that he boycotted a January debate sponsored by Fox when the network wouldnâ€ ™ t nix her .
Asked about the Kelly rematch Thursday , Trump said : â€œIâ€ ™ m ready.â€
�
Are you ready ?
What do you think is at stake tonight ?
Who do you expect to excel , and who to botch it ?
As usual , share your thoughts in the comments , please , and weâ€ ™ ll get some in the blog .
Thanks for reading and participating !"
2016-03-05,"The kids â€ “ at least at CPAC â€
“ are not all right with Donald Trump .
In the straw poll that traditionally finishes the three - day conservative event â€ “ which is famed as much as a hook - up spot for college kids as it as a measuring stick of the grassroots â€ “ Ted Cruz won with 40 % .
The Texas senator was followed by Marco Rubio at 30 % and Trump with 15 % .
It did not help that Trump canceled on the event in order to hold a rally in a place that his campaign spelled â€œWitchita , Kanasasâ€ � .
The Republican frontrunner objected to taking any questions during his scheduled appearance there .
Cruz and Rubio received rapturous receptions from the crowd at CPAC , as the room filled to capacity for their speeches .
Cruz in particular was received well , the conservative firebrand being repeatedly interrupted by applause .
But he and Rubio were clearly favorites at an event where Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s name was booed almost as frequently as Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s .
Kyle Foley , a first - time attendee from Orlando , Florida , was wearing a Rubio sticker .
He told the Guardian he â€œreally liked [ the Florida senator ] as a person .
Nothing I blatantly disagree with.â€ �
In contrast , he said : â€œI have every issue with Trump .
Heâ€
™ s a liar on basically everything.â€
�
As one staffer for a presidential campaign told the Guardian , there were â€œa lot of Cruz supporters and a lot of Rubio
supportersâ€ � present while Trump pointedly â€œdidnâ€ ™ t show upâ€ � .
But disapproval of Trump wasnâ€ ™ t just based on that .
Trumpâ€ ™
s appeal on the stump is a rejection of the conservative establishment â€ “ CPAC is the personification of it , or at least those who seek to join it .
The event is filled with GOP operatives and college students who aspire to become GOP operatives .
Every year , many of the attendees are young Republicans who hope to find their first job out of college or a potential first lady .
The conference has a furious and not very furtive singles scene .
For these young Republicans , both Cruz and Rubio have appeal .
Trump , who exit polls show is disproportionately supported by the older and less educated , is still the candidate of the masses .
He may be winning states but among establishment Republicans and those who wish to be establishment Republicans , he has a lot of work to do ."
2016-03-05,"The reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner has offered to serve as Americaâ€ ™ s â€œtrans ambassadorâ€
� if Ted Cruz wins the presidency â€ “ leading many in the LGBT community to express horror at the prospect .
â€œI like Ted Cruz , â€ �
Jenner said , in an interview with the Advocate .
â€œI think heâ€
™ s very conservative and a great constitutionalist and a very articulate man .
I havenâ€
™ t endorsed him or anything like that .
But I also think :
heâ€
™ s an evangelical Christian , and probably one of the worst ones when it comes to trans issues.â€
�
Last year , the Texas senator called the federal governmentâ€ ™ s support for gender - neutral bathrooms for trans students â€œlunacyâ€ � .
Jenner , of Keeping Up With the Kardashians fame and one of the most visible transgender women in the world , has often been criticized for her own lack of understanding of trans issues .
Thanks to her money , fame and years of privilege as a successful white male athlete , her experience does not mirror that of most trans people .
However , Jenner offered to be a â€œtrans ambassadorâ€
� for Cruz , with all the girls from her show
I Am
Cait â€ “ the second season of which begins on Sunday â€
“ sitting on a trans issues advisory board .
â€œYes , trans ambassador to the president of the United States
, so we can say : â€˜Ted , love what youâ€ ™ re doing , but hereâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s going on , â€ ™ â€ �
Jenner said .
Jenner acknowledged that most trans people are Democrats , but said she was a proud Republican .
â€œNumber one , â€ �
she said , â€œif
we donâ€ ™ t have a country , we donâ€ ™ t have trans issues .
We need jobs .
We need a vibrant economy .
I want every trans person to have a job , â€ � she said .
Trans activist Cherno Biko told the Guardian Jennerâ€ ™ s political comments were â€œdangerousâ€ � , after last year saw the highest rates of murder of trans and non - gender conforming people on record .
â€œWe simply can not afford to have Caitlyn Jenner supporting people who hate us , â€ � said Biko , 24 , co - chair of the Young Womenâ€ ™ s Advisory Council for the city of New York .
â€œAnd if she continues down this road , she will have blood on her hands .
â€œHer being a Republican .
Her not supporting marriage equality .
Being negative about people needing income support .
You canâ€
™ t do all of that and them claim to be an ambassador for a community that you canâ€ ™ t represent.â€ � Biko suggested how Jennerâ€ ™ s help was in fact most needed .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need your help in the way that youâ€ ™ re doing it now , â€ � she said .
â€œWe need your money.â€ �"
2016-03-06,"Mitt Romney was clear about who
shouldnâ€ ™ t be the Republican Partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee when he spoke Thursday in Utah .
He was not clear about whom he did want to see .
He said Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and John Kasich need to â€œfind common groundâ€ � in the push back against the rising tide of Donald Trump .
In the world of Republican partisanship , that probably meant getting behind runner - up Cruz .
Deepening this impression was Cruzâ€ ™ s victory in Saturdayâ€ ™ s caucuses in Kansas and Maine .
Kansas wasnâ€ ™ t terribly surprising given Cruzâ€ ™ s nearly identical trajectory to Rick Santorumâ€ ™ s 2012 run , in which the arch - conservative Catholic appealed to the Republican evangelical base .
But Maine was surprising â€ “
almost stunning â€ “ and that small , rural , rugged north - eastern state , mostly forgotten by official Washington , might prove to be the turning point in the GOP nomination .
Maine governor Paul LePage endorsed Trump , but Romneyâ€ ™ s
anti - Trump speech Thursday may have been enough for moderate Republican clam diggers who still hold Romney in high regard .
Cruz knows Saturdayâ€ ™ s results made his case .
He intimated that now would be a good time for rivals Rubio and Kasich to drop out .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ll continue to amass delegates but what needs to happen is the field needs to continue to narrow , â€ � he said , according to Politico .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re divided , Donald wins.â€ �
He added : â€œThe other candidates are increasing the likelihood that Donald Trump is the nominee.â€ � The clock is ticking .
There are two races on 15 March that are must - wins for whoever is going be to a viable Trump alternative .
Both states are winner - takes - all delegates .
Kasich is the governor of Ohio and favored there .
Rubio is a senator from Florida and favored there .
If they drop out before then , they can release their current cache of delegates and make the way clear for Cruz .
The irony here is the Republican establishment despises Cruz .
Bob Dole , George HW Bush , and George W Bush have made public their dim views of him .
Cruz called majority leader Mitch McConnell a liar on the Senate floor .
His public record of personal peevishness is growing .
But that was before Super Tuesday and the mathematical threat posed by Donald Trump .
Even if Kasich and Rubio drop out , the odds are still against Cruz .
Trump knows Cruz is being seen as the alternative .
Cruz did well in Maine , Trump said Saturday , because â€œitâ€ ™ s very close to Canada.â€

2016-03-06,"Ted Cruz denounced the possibility of a brokered convention to decide a Republican presidential nominee on Sunday , as the death of former first lady Nancy Reagan cast the schisms of the modern party into high relief compared with the unity of the party under her husband .
Cruz , who won more delegates than frontrunner Donald Trump in the four states that held Republican votes on Saturday night , told CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation he believed any strategy of a brokered convention â€ “ a last resort to stop Trump â€
“ simply represents â€œthe fevered talk of the Washington
establishmentâ€ � .
The Texas senator warned that if party leaders resorted to choosing any candidate besides the majority delegate winner , â€œa manifest uprisingâ€ � would ensue .
His remarks underscored the dilemma facing the party as it searches for a cohesive strategy to beat Trump , who according to the Associated Press has 382 of the 1,237 necessary delegates to win the nomination .
Cruz has 300 , far more than Marco Rubio and John Kasich , whom party leaders prefer to the unpredictable billionaire and disliked senator .
â€œIf you want to beat Donald Trump ,
â€ �
Cruz said , â€œyou got to beat him at the ballot box , and our campaign is the only campaign that has demonstrated it can do that.â€
�
Cruz won in Kansas and Maine on Saturday , while Trump took Louisiana and Kentucky .
The only other candidate to have won a state , Marco Rubio , had a poor night and has amassed only 128 delegates .
While the Reagans united the party and have acted as lodestars ever since , the modern party is fractured by warring factions .
Three positions have emerged , mostly around the surprise of Trump :
Stop Trump at all costs , a position supported by the 2012 nominee , Mitt Romney ; let the people decide , supported by Cruz and populist broadcasters like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh ; and a pained reluctance to intervene , as voiced by mainstream leaders .
Still , mounting setbacks for a Republican establishment that has so far placed its faith in two failing candidates , Rubio and Jeb Bush , suggest that it may ultimately have to bend to a Trump nomination .
On Sunday , party chair Reince Priebus told ABCâ€ ™ s This Week : â€œThere are no plans to undo the rules or change the nomination process midstream .
Priebus said a brokered convention was possible but unlikely .
â€œI
just donâ€
™ t see that happening , â€ � he said .
â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t mean itâ€
™ s impossible , it just means you donâ€
™ t know what next weekâ€ ™ s going to bring , or the week after.â€
�
But there are deep fears that by refusing to indicate a preference among the three non - Trump candidates , party leaders have let the New York developer steal the show .
The stop -
Trump dilemma has created unlikely alliances , including placing the studious Romney hand in glove with the bombastic Beck , who on Sunday compared Trump to Adolf Hitler , a â€œfunny kind of characterâ€ � who provoked dangerous forces .
Beck has warned that any efforts by â€œthe GOP establishmentâ€ � to undermine Trump with a contested convention could â€œlead to civil war in the countryâ€ � , over the disenfranchisement of grassroots conservatives .
â€œI wonâ€ ™ t vote for Donald Trump ever , â€ �
Beck said , â€œbut I will stand for his right because the people have spoken.â€
�
Beck is not alone among Republican grassroots populists in identifying danger if the party tries to force its hand in Cleveland .
Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh warned on Fox News Sunday that the Trump insurgency could change the heart of the Republican party .
â€œThe party may be reconstituted and changed , and that may not be a bad thing , â€ �
he said .
â€œThis is real .
Itâ€ ™ s not a phase or a temper tantrum .
The average American thinks the Republican party is actively oriented against their interests and does not understand the crisis they think the country is in.â€
�
The former House majority leader Newt Gingrich also described the rise of Trump , and the partyâ€ ™ s rejection of him , as a sign of the gulf between Republicans in Washington and their voters around the country .
He argued that Trumpism may not be what mainstream Republicans desire , but it is what they will have to accept â€ “ a theory bolstered by Rubioâ€ ™ s failure to sway voters despite dozens of endorsements from governors and members of Congress .
Gingrich told the Washington Post that criticism of the billionaire by mainstream Republicans shows how they misunderstand deep - seated dissatisfaction among many Americans , who no longer feel like they truly belong to either party .
â€œYou have a party that mishandled the economic collapse , an elite leadership that failed to reform things , an attitude of arrogance to the very Tea Party people who wanted to change things , â€ �
Gingrich said .
â€œThe people in the imperial capital can not understand why everyone in the rest of the country is offended by sending money to the imperial capital.â€ � Romney , who this week launched a stinging attack on Trump , describing him as â€œa phonyâ€ � conservative , said he would support any of the three alternatives at the convention except Trump â€ “ even though he himself accepted Trumpâ€ ™ s endorsement for president in 2012 .
Romney denied his intervention signalled interest in mounting another challenge of his own .
In the event of a Trump nomination , he said , â€œI plan to go to the voting booth and find someone whoâ€ ™ s running as a conservative , or just write the name of someone I believe should be president of the United States and who I could be proud of.â€ �
Regardless of the fright Trump may give the Republican establishment , even Kasich agreed that Washington â€œinsidersâ€ � could not be allowed to pick the nominee .
In comments to ABC , the Ohio governor denied his party was on the verge of falling apart .
â€œI think , ultimately , at the end of the day , â€ � he said , â€œthe Republican party is a reflection of the nominee.â€ �"
2016-03-06,"Saturday was a big day for second - place candidates in the presidential race , as Ted Cruz grabbed morale - boosting wins in caucuses Kansas and Maine while Bernie Sanders saw victories in Kansas and Nebraska .
Their gains were , however , countered by victories for Hillary Clinton , in the Democratic Louisiana primary , and Donald Trump in Louisiana and a Republican caucus in Kentucky .
Here are nine things we learned from the dayâ€ ™ s events .
Marco Rubio may not be able to go the distance , as Ted Cruz manoeuvres into the â€œonly candidate who can stop Trumpâ€ � spot .
Saturday featured several dismal showings from the Florida senator , who now is pinning all his hopes on his home state , which votes on 15 March .
Bernie Sanders regained some momentum , picking up wins in ( admittedly non - diverse ) Democratic caucuses in Nebraska and Kansas .
But Hillary Clinton maintained her commanding delegate lead , of around 200 , with an easy win in the Louisiana primary .
Donald Trump really , really wants â€œto take on Ted , one on oneâ€ � .
This reflects that Rubioâ€ ™ s only real purpose in this race now is to take Florida delegates away from the frontrunner .
Cruz won by surprising margins in Maine and Kansas .
Trump put the former down to Maineâ€ ™ s proximity to Cruzâ€ ™ s birthplace : Canada .
The Maine Republican party likes to talk .
A lot .
It took maybe 15 minutes to get to the point with its results .
Trump supporters alleged voter fraud in Kansas .
Trump , however , didnâ€ ™ t reference it in his speech from Florida .
What he did reference , however , was his worry that moderate conservatives might run a third - party candidate against him .
He appealed to conservative worries about supreme court justices .
â€œThe Democrats would have an absolute free run , â€ �
he said .
Trump has , he claims , â€œtaken more questions from reporters than anybody who has ever livedâ€ � ."
2016-03-06,"Donald Trump has reiterated his determination that the US should stop â€œplaying by the rulesâ€ � in its fight against Islamic State militants .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re talking about waterboarding like itâ€ ™ s the worst thing in the world , â€ �
he said in an interview broadcast on Sunday , adding :
â€œI think we have to increase the laws because the laws are not working.â€
�
The Republican presidential frontrunner spoke to CBS in Florida on Saturday night , after he won the Kentucky caucus and Louisiana primary .
Trump leads the Republican presidential race from the Texas senator Ted Cruz , who won in Maine and Kansas on Saturday .
Cruz has advocated bringing back waterboarding and carpet - bombing Isis targets in Syria and Iraq .
This week , a group of leading Republican figures on national security said they would not follow orders from a President Trump who followed policies he has advocated on the campaign trail , such as waterboarding and the targeting of the families of terror suspects , that contravened international law .
Trump subsequently rowed back on the issue , saying in a statement : â€œI will not order a military officer to disobey the law .
It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.â€ �
On the campaign trail in Kansas and Florida on Saturday , though , he changed his position again , saying he would â€œhave those laws broadenedâ€ � .
Speaking to CBS in the interview broadcast on Sunday , Trump said : â€œWe can not beat Isis .
We should beat Isis very quickly .
General Patton would have had Isis down in about three days .
General Douglas MacArthur .
We are playing by a different set of rules.â€ �
He added : â€œ[T]he Isis people chop off the heads , and they then go back to their homes and they talk .
And they hear weâ€ ™ re talking about waterboarding like itâ€ ™ s the worst thing in the world , and theyâ€ ™ ve just drowned 100 people and chopped off 50 heads .
They must think we are a little bit on the weak side .
â€œWe are playing by rules , but they have no rules.â€
�
Trump was asked if â€œplaying by rulesâ€ � was what â€œseparates us from the savages?â€ � â€œNo , â€ � he said ,
â€œI donâ€
™ t think so â€
¦ we have to beat the savages.â€
�
He was asked :
â€œBy being savages?â€ �
Trump said : â€œNo , well .
We have to play the game the way
theyâ€ ™ re playing the game .
Youâ€ ™ re not going to win if weâ€ ™ re soft and they have no rules .
Now , I want to stay within the laws .
I want to do all of that , but I think we have to increase the laws because the laws are not working.â€ �"
2016-03-06,"A ferocious week of attacks on Donald Trump appeared to loosen his grip on the Republican presidential race on â€œSuper Saturdayâ€ � , while Bernie Sanders showed there may also be some life left in the Democratic race .
Conservative champion Ted Cruz won heavily in the Republican caucus in Kansas and won by a similar margin in Maine , before Trump underlined his national advantage with victories in Louisiana and Kentucky .
With 47 delegates up for grabs , Louisiana was the biggest prize of the night and the only state using a primary rather than caucus system .
Trump has tended to do better in primaries , where his support among first - time voters and independents can overwhelm the more determined activists who back Cruz .
Trumpâ€ ™
s victories â€ “ by 4.4 % in Louisiana and 3.6 % in Kentucky â€ “ were by smaller margins than Cruz won his states , meaning the Texan took more delegates on the night .
The results suggested neither may reach the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination outright .
In a speech from Florida delivered after Kentucky was called , Trump fired a warning shot at party leaders tempted to use a so - called brokered convention to introduce fresh candidates , something that could prompt him to run as an independent .
â€œIf they run a third party
it will make it impossible for the Republican party to win , â€ � said Trump , warning that a Democratic victory in November could result in a lasting liberal takeover of the supreme court .
â€œMarco Rubio had a very , very bad night , â€ � he added .
â€˜I think itâ€ ™ s time he drops out of the race.â€ �
Trump also defended his reference to his penis size in the last TV debate â€ “ â€œI
didnâ€
™ t bring it up , [ Rubio ] brought it up , but I finished itâ€ � â€ “ but appeared unwilling to let the initial attacks on the size of his hands go by without one last reference to his golf swing .
â€œDo
I hit the ball good?â€ �
he asked .
â€œDo
I hit the ball long ?
Is Trump strong ?
Huh?â€
�
In the Democratic race , Hillary Clinton lost Kansas and Nebraska to a resurgent Sanders campaign , although her own win in Louisiana , as expected , left her well ahead in net delegates at the end of the night .
Though not as significant as the dozen Super Tuesday contests this week or the large states voting on 15 March , the five states voting on Saturday suggested the race to secure party nominations was far from settled .
In Kansas , Cruz won by 48.2%-23.3 % over Trump , narrowly missing becoming the first Republican to win 50 % of the vote in any state .
He also celebrated an unofficial but symbolic win on Saturday in a straw poll among activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in Washington .
â€œBy any measure , Kansas , CPAC and Maine are all very different sets of voters and I think what it represents is a Republican party coalescing against Donald Trump , â€ �
the Texas senator said , at a press conference in Idaho .
Cruz had already shown his popularity among Christian evangelicals and the Tea Party with wins in Iowa , Texas and Oklahoma , but his strong performance in Maine may suggest that a wider group of Republican voters is beginning to tire of
Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial theatrics .
This week , after another raucous television debate , he was declared a fraud by former nominee Mitt Romney and denounced as a national security risk by dozens of Republican foreign policy veterans .
Cruz tried to paint himself , not the distant - third Rubio , as the most likely candidate to prevent Trump from winning a majority of delegates before the convention , but also an inheritor of the same anti - establishment wave .
Rubio finished fourth of four in Maine , behind even John Kasich , who is pinning all his hopes on his own state , Ohio , and thus missed out on any delegates at all .
â€œGod bless the great state of Idaho , â€ �
Cruz said .
â€œAnd while weâ€ ™ re at it , let me say God bless Kansas and God bless Maine.â€ � Idaho votes on Tuesday 8 March .
â€œNow itâ€ ™ s a little bit early , the votes are still being counted â€ ¦ but we have roughly 50 % of the vote , and the scream you hear , the howl you hear from Washington DC , is utter terror at what we the people are doing together.â€ �
The Democratic race was harder to read , though there were signs a strong turnout helped Sanders beat Clinton in Nebraska and Kansas .
In an echo of his performance on Super Tuesday , however , Sanders faced an uphill battle in Louisiana , particularly with African American voters .
Worth 51 delegates , Clintonâ€ ™ s southern stronghold gave her 70 % of the vote .
After Saturdayâ€ ™ s voting , according to the Associated Press , Clinton had 1,104 delegates top 446 for Sanders .
The winning total is 2,383 .
In the Republican race , Trump has 378 delegates , Cruz 295 and Rubio 123 .
The threshold is 1,237 .
Sanders hopes that by showing there is still passionate support for him in states so far outside his New England stronghold , he can regather momentum for bigger battles in states like Michigan and Ohio .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re in an intense stretch of the campaign where success for Bernie means the political and media establishment must take note , â€ � said campaign manager Jeff Weaver , in an email to supporters on Saturday ."
2016-03-07,"Fresh off two weekend wins , the Texas senator campaigned in Mississippi and Michigan , which both vote tomorrow .
Heâ€ ™ s still behind Donald Trump in delegates â€ “ but heâ€
™ s a man with a plan ...
In a striking sign of a race in flux , Cruz reportedly was prepared to announce his first endorsements from Senate colleagues â€ “ many of whom dislike Cruz â€ ¦ except , it seems , in a Trump - mergency .

2016-03-07,"A manhunt is under way in northern Idaho after a suspect from Coeur dâ€ ™ Alene allegedly shot a pastor who led prayers at a Ted Cruz rally over the weekend .
Police have said they do not know the motive behind the attack of Sr Pastor Tim Remington , who survived the shooting .
Kyle Andrew Odom , 30 , â€œshould be considered armed and dangerousâ€
�
, Coeur dâ€ ™ Alene police said in a written statement posted on Facebook .
He allegedly accosted Remington in the parking lot of the Altar Church after services and shot him multiple times .
â€œWe donâ€

Odom , who is a 6-foot - tall white man with blond hair and blue eyes , â€œis not
somebody weâ€ ™ ve dealt with that I know of .
I donâ€

t know of any other criminal recordâ€ � .
A spokesman for the Idaho department of corrections said â€œno one with that name has been under the jurisdictionâ€ � of the agency .
The state judiciary database shows that Odom had three traffic citations and lists one legal case â€œsealed by court rule or judicial orderâ€ � .
On Saturday , Remington offered the invocation at the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s rally in Coeur dâ€ ™ Alene ahead of the Republican primary .
Local media outlets pegged the crowd at around 3,000 in this conservative stronghold .
â€œWe talked to the suspectâ€ ™ s family , â€ � Reneau said ,
â€œand right now we donâ€ ™ t have any information that it is related to the political rally.â€
�
The investigation continues .
â€œOur prayers are with Pastor Tim , his family , and the doctors who are supervising his care , â€ � the Cruz campaign said in a brief statement Monday .
â€œWe pray for his full recovery and are thankful for the efforts of law enforcement to ensure the attacker is swiftly brought to justice.â€ �
Remingtonâ€ ™ s
â€œlife consists of victim offender mediation , family mediation , drug and alcohol counselingâ€ � , according to the church website , which says the pastor and his wife Cindy started Altar Church more than 18 years ago .
He also serves as director of Good Samaritan Rehabilitation drug and alcohol services .
â€œTimâ€ ™ s Life Verseâ€ � , the church website says , comes from Philippians 1:21 : â€œFor me to live is Christ , and to die is gain.â€ �
A woman answering the phone at Altar Church who would only give her first name as Sandy said that Remington is â€œstable and out of the critical areaâ€ � .
Roger Crigger , who describes Remington as â€œa very good friend of mineâ€ � , on Facebook posted prayers Sunday night for the Idaho clergyman .

2016-03-07,"Michael Bloomberg , the former New York City mayor and one of Americaâ€ ™ s richest men , announced on Monday that he will not mount a third - party run for the White House .
â€œI believe I could win a number of diverse states , but not enough to win the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win the presidency , â€ �
Bloomberg wrote in an editorial for Bloomberg View entitled The Risk I Will Not Take .
â€œWhen
I look at the data , itâ€ ™ s clear to me that if I entered the race , I could not
win.â€ �
The move is likely to be seen as a recognition that Hillary Clinton is set to survive the challenge of Bernie Sanders and protracted controversy over emails sent during her time as secretary of state , and therefore represents the best chance of defeating anti - establishment Republicans Donald Trump and Ted Cruz .
A Bloomberg candidacy could backfire by diminishing her support .
â€œAs the race stands now , with Republicans in charge of both Houses
, there is a good chance that my candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz , â€ �
Bloomberg wrote .
â€œThat is not a risk I can take in good conscience.â€

The 74-year - old Democrat - turned - Republican - turned - Democrat - turned independent was fiercely critical of Trump , saying the property tycoon has run â€œthe most divisive and demagogic presidential campaign I can remember , preying on peopleâ€ ™ s prejudices and fearsâ€ � .
He acknowledged that he and his fellow billionaire had been on â€œfriendly termsâ€
� and that he had twice agreed to be on Trumpâ€ ™ s
reality TV show The Apprentice .
But the former mayor said that Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign â€œappeals to our worst impulsesâ€ � .
Referencing Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign slogan , he added : â€œWe can not â€˜make America great againâ€ ™ by turning our backs on the values that made us the worldâ€ ™ s greatest nation in the first place .
I love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future â€ “
and so I will not enter the race for president of the United States.â€ � Bloomberg
was similarly critical of Cruz , saying the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s â€œpandering on immigration may lack Trumpâ€ ™ s rhetorical excess , but it is no less extremeâ€ � .
The three - term mayor of New York and founder of financial titan Bloomberg LP reportedly began weighing the prospects of a presidential run earlier this year , as the primary contests in both the Republican and Democratic parties presented a possible opening for a third - party candidate to successfully run for office .
It seemed that the the success of outsiders Trump and Sanders might open up a centrist third lane for Bloomberg , a moderate Republican with liberal stances on social issues like same - sex marriage and gun control .
In New York he banned smoking in public places and introduced calorie counts on menus .
Bloomberg , who had suggested readiness to spend $ 1b of his own money on the run , set a mid - March deadline for his team of advisers to assess the feasibility of entering the race .
He took some exploratory steps , making a mock TV ad , preparing to open campaign offices in Texas and North Carolina and having aides begin to vet possible vice presidential candidates .
But only about 12 % of likely voters said they would support him in a three - way race for president with Clinton and Trump , according to a Reuters / Ipsos national poll of 1,695 likely voters from 2 to 7 March .
Another 41 % said they would support Clinton and 31 % said they would back Trump .
Bloomberg cited the 12th amendment of the US constitution as an insurmountable hurdle to his candidacy : â€œIn a three - way race , itâ€ ™ s unlikely any candidate would win a majority of electoral votes , and then the power to choose the president would be taken out of the hands of the American people and thrown to Congress .
â€œThe fact is , even if I were to receive the most popular votes and the most electoral votes , victory would be highly unlikely , because most members of Congress would vote for their partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
Party loyalists in Congress â€ “ not the American people or the electoral college â€ “ would determine the next president.â€
�
One of the wealthiest people in the United States estimated to be worth $ 38b , Bloomberg has previously toyed with presidential runs , but concluded ahead of the 2008 and 2012 campaigns that he could not win .
When 2020 comes around , he will be 78 ."
2016-03-09,"The year was 2013 .
It was a more innocent time in conservative America .
No primary candidates had declared themselves , Donald Trump was still safely tucked away in a reality show , and Senator Ted Cruz gave the keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference , the Republican Lollapalooza .
His speech was mostly forgettable , arguing that Republican success was inevitable if they simply bullied the Democrats hard enough .
He salted it with references to pop culture and firmly denied that he was a â€œwacko birdâ€ � , as John McCain had recently alleged .
He cracked a weird joke comparing a newly svelte Newt Gingrich to Anne Hathawayâ€ ™ s character in Les Miserables .
Alas , nothing he would say that night would stick to Ted Cruz the way this one small joke , tweeted from anonymous Twitter account @redpillamerica , would :
This , according to the Daily Dot and confirmed by my own searches , appears to be the first time someone on the internet decided to put Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s name in the same sentence as the Zodiac killerâ€ ™ s .
â€œI think it was a convergence of being a fan of the Fincher film [ 2007â€ ™ s Zodiac ] , the birtherism craze of 2012 , and the sociopathic vibe one gets when Ted Cruz walks , talks , and breathes , â€ � the person behind @redpillamerica told me .
â€œWhile Trump is a buffoon , Cruz is the kind of guy that makes you want to check the closet , under the bed , and make sure the doors are locked.â€ �
You might call that one
manâ€ ™ s opinion .
But if you frequent certain precincts of the internet lately , youâ€ ™ ll see that it has blossomed into quite a craze .
People all over the country are slyly linking the Republican presidential candidateâ€ ™ s name with that of the serial killer who terrorized California for several years in the late 60s and early 70s , and who was never definitively identified .
Letâ€ ™ s say youâ€ ™ ve checked out Twitter in the middle of the most recent Republican debate .
You might have come across a tweet like this :
Or this : Or
letâ€ ™ s say that in your daily rounds of several respectable news outlets
â€ “ among them the Washington Post and Vox Media â€
“
you found serious journalists who took it upon themselves to â€œdebunkâ€
� the notion that Cruz is in fact a serial killer .
Last week , for extra fun and mouseclicks , the respected polling outfit Public Policy Polling found that 38 % of voters in Florida believed that Ted Cruz might be the Zodiac killer .
( In fact , 10 % said that yes , they thought he was ; 28 % were â€œnot sureâ€ � . )
And , inevitably , there is a Facebook page .
These things might lead you to believe that there really is a constituency in America who have been fooled by this meme into thinking that the Zodiac is several hundred delegates away from the presidency .
Perhaps there is .
More likely , however , is that these people are kidding .
In fact , the first rule of the â€œTed Cruz is the Zodiacâ€ � meme club is this : you donâ€ ™ t actually believe Ted Cruz is the Zodiac .
â€œTo those Cruz trolls who insist that we â€˜look at the factsâ€ ™ that Ted was not even born when the Zodiac was committing these horrid crimes ...
yes we know , â€ �
@redpillamerica volunteered to me over a Twitter direct message .
( The first confirmed Zodiac killing took place in 1968 ; Cruz was born in 1970 . )
â€œLighten up!â€
�
But the meme works on a higher level .
It satirizes the fact that political discourse in America has sunk so low that this kind of spurious accusation can actually get traction .
Ted - Cruz - is - the - Zodiac types often say theyâ€ ™ re only doing what birther Republicans did to Obama in 2008 .
They repeatedly insisted that Obamaâ€ ™ s birth certificate was faked , and that he was born in Kenya .
Gradually , certain members of the public began to believe it .
So claiming that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac simply mimics the mass - panic technique Republicans have already perfected , several meme proponents argued .
The point has landed pretty sharply .
Now that so many people have posted about Cruz and the Zodiac , angry Cruz supporters often appear in comments sections , on Facebook pages and elsewhere , to defend their man .
Another â€œTed Cruz is the Zodiacâ€ � enthusiast , Tim Faust , recently tweeted the following : Faust , a data scientist , has played a particularly altruistic role in all this .
He came across the meme on Twitter .
Faust is , to say the least , not a Cruz fan .
â€œThe man is deplorable , contemptible , â€ � he wrote to me .
â€œThis election is resplendent with abuses of integrity for political gain , and yet Cruz is still the worst of the bunch .
How ? !
This would be some dark - ass comedy , if tens of millions of lives werenâ€ ™ t at stake.â€ � Faust promptly enlisted an artist friend , Rory Blank , to design a T - shirt .
A fundraising project was born .
Faust is a longtime pro - choice activist , so he decided sales of the shirt would benefit the West Fund , which helps women pay for abortions in Texas .
Initially , Faust says , he expected to make perhaps 20 T - shirts .
But the project caught on , and he told me when he ended the sale on 2 March he had sold about 7,500 T - shirts .
That comes out to an estimated donation of about $ 69,000 .
Faust is satisfied with what heâ€ ™ s done so far .
He also says that he has been urged by many to reopen sales .
The logistics of mailing 200 T - shirts a day , however , exhausted him .
Heâ€ ™ s not sure heâ€ ™ ll be able to reopen .
â€œCommercial sales to privately fund reproductive health is its own kind of libertarian dystopia , â€ � he said .
â€œThis is no replacement for the actual good work of on - the - ground organizing .
It was just a fun way to burn off some steam.â€ � Fun indeed , but some people are beginning to wonder if Cruz , faced with the internet ubiquity of the accusation , will somehow be forced to deny it .
A favorite offshoot of the joke is to point out that Cruz has never denied that heâ€ ™ s a serial killer , so the possibility remains .
â€œSelfishly , I would love for him to actual[ly ] deny it
but the chances are slim , â€ � @redpillamerica said .
â€œTrump on the other hand ?
I think weâ€ ™ ve crossed the Rubicon on Trumpâ€ ™ s daily insane vile diatribes .
As Florida looms , I would say there is a very good chance Trump accuses Ted of the murders.â€ �
Though @redpillamerica did not want to be identified by name , he told me heâ€ ™ s a New Yorker , 43 , and has worked in politics his whole professional life .
So he might actually know what heâ€ ™ s talking about ."
2016-03-09,"Kyle Odom , the man suspected of shooting Pastor Tim Remington after the churchman spoke at a Ted Cruz rally , has been arrested in Washington DC , according to authorities .
Odom , 30 , was arrested after he â€œthrew unknown material over the south fence line at the White House
complexâ€ � , said a secret service statement quoted by the Washington Post .
CNN also cited the secret service as confirming Odomâ€ ™ s arrest .
Detective Jared Reneau of Coeur dâ€
™ Alene police confirmed Odom was in custody on Tuesday night .
Meanwhile Remington had regained consciousness and was talking with his family , an associate said on Tuesday .
Odom , a former marine from Coeur dâ€ ™ Alene , is suspected of shooting Remington a day after the pastor led the prayer at a weekend campaign rally for Cruz , a Republican presidential candidate .
Authorities said there was no indication
Remingtonâ€ ™ s appearance with Cruz had anything to do with the shooting , which took place outside his church in broad daylight .
â€œHowever it does appear that this was a pre - planned attack , â€ � Coeur dâ€ ™ Alene Police Chief Lee White said on Monday .
â€œAnd I will tell you that some details surrounding Mr Odomâ€ ™ s planning are disturbing.â€ �
He did not elaborate .
Several news outlets in Spokane received letters on Tuesday that purported to be from Odom , Detective Reneau said .
The letters , postmarked Monday , contained a sheet of paper that read â€œThe Truth About Kyle
Odomâ€ �
but had nothing else written on them , Reneau said .
â€œWe are trying to confirm their authenticity , â€ � Reneau said .
Remington , 55 , regained consciousness on Monday night in a Coeur dâ€ ™ Alene hospital , said John Padula , outreach pastor for the Altar Church where Remington is the senior pastor .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s whispering and talking to his family a little bit , â€ � Padula said on Tuesday .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s doing absolutely amazing .
He gave me a thumbâ€ ™ s up last night when I went in.â€ � Remington , who is married and has four children , has no feeling in his right arm , Padula said .
Remington and his wife have been with the Altar Church for nearly two decades , and specialised in the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction , Padula said .
The church has extensive programs , including in - patient rehabilitation , for addicts , Padula said .
Padula was a meth addict for 17 years before going through the churchâ€ ™ s program seven years ago , he said .
Police said Odom drove to the Spokane , Washington , area on Interstate 90 after the Sunday afternoon shooting , according to information from traffic cameras .
He then turned south before they lost his trail .
Odom had no connection with the church before showing up before services early on Sunday morning , Padula said .
The Coeur dâ€ ™ Alene police department issued a warrant of attempted first - degree murder for Odom , who was described as having no criminal record but a history of mental illness .
White said Odom was armed when he attended services in the church earlier on Sunday and the violence could have been much worse .
Odom served in the Marines from 2006 to 2010 , receiving the Iraq campaign medal and other awards .
He rose to the rank of corporal .
Odom later graduated from the University of Idaho with a degree in biochemistry .

2016-03-09,"Itâ€ ™ s been a good season for candidates who can channel the anger of the electorate and we saw that again on Tuesday night , when exit polls continued to turn up in favor of Donald Trump , while Bernie Sanders pulled off a surprise victory in Michigan .
Trumpâ€ ™ s victory in Mississippi was so decisive that he was declared the winner in that state moments after the first polling reports came in , and he was declared the winner in Michigan soon after .
Ted Cruz netted a win in Idaho , keeping a firm grip on second place in the overall GOP race .
Trumpâ€ ™
s
continued winning streak â€ “ despite talk of a lull in his candidacy
â€ “ wasnâ€ ™ t the biggest victory of the night .
That belonged to Sanders , who managed to pull off something heâ€
™ s been trying to prove throughout his campaign : that he can compete with Hillary Clinton in states like Michigan , where African American voters make up roughly a quarter of the electorate .
Clinton won fewer than two - thirds of African American voters in the state , significantly down from the 80 - 90 % support sheâ€ ™ s enjoyed elsewhere .
The victories for Trump and Sanders come after a week when both menâ€ ™ s chances were being played down .
Sandersâ€ ™ campaign had been all but left for dead after he failed to make significant inroads with minority voters on Super Tuesday .
Trump faced attacks from the party establishment ( most notably Mitt Romney ) and scorn from the media establishment for his habit of asking people to raise their hands and pledge allegiance to him at rallies , something Cruz quickly seized upon .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve had seven years of a president who thinks heâ€ ™ s an emperor ,
â€ � he quipped .
For a fleeting moment on Tuesday , it looked like Trumpâ€ ™ s star might finally be fading .
After all , on Saturday he only won by a few percentage points in Louisiana and Kentucky , while Cruz won handily in Maine and Kansas .
But winning by less is still , to put it in Trump terms , # winning .
And Tuesdayâ€ ™ s results suggest the weekend was merely an ebb in the candidateâ€ ™ s current .
Trumpâ€ ™ s win in Mississippi , in particular , is an embarrassment for Cruz , whose plan was to win over the south â€ “ something that , as a devout conservative from Texas , he should have been able to do .
But that strategy didnâ€
™ t work for Cruz last month in South Carolina , where he lost southern evangelical voters to Trump by a landslide , and it didnâ€ ™ t work for him on Super Tuesday , either .
Mississippi was , if anything , an unwelcome reprise of whatâ€ ™ s beginning to sound like a familiar story for Cruz .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s win in Michigan is arguably even more significant , and not just because he squelched John Kasichâ€ ™ s improbable hopes for a win there and by extension Ohio .
Michigan is especially valuable politically because it embodies Americaâ€ ™ s manufacturing industry and is a potential bellwether for the all - important Ohio .
The state is just as valuable in a general election .
While Michigan is expected to go blue in a general , Trumpâ€ ™ s strong performance there ( and
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s difficulty in running against Sanders there ) suggests Trumpâ€ ™ s talking points on trade and the perils of outsourcing jobs overseas are resonating .
Sanders spent a lot of time campaigning in Michigan and itâ€ ™ s apparently paid off â€
“ heâ€
™ s performed far better in the state than anyone predicted .
And itâ€ ™ s somewhat telling that heâ€ ™ s focused single - mindedly on trade .
After all , the negative effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( Nafta ) , Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s signature trade deal , are still felt acutely here .
And Hillary Clinton was slow to come out against the Trans - Pacific Partnership and voice criticism of Nafta .
Those are trade positions Sanders has long held , and Clintonâ€ ™ s slowness to adopt them gave him another chance to paint her as politically opportunistic .
Clinton thought she had finessed the trade issue , by focusing on other problems in Michigan , like Flintâ€ ™ s lead - poisoned water , and by skewering Sanders over his vote against the auto bailout ( his campaign said it was part of a bigger vote against a bailout for Wall Street ) .
But clearly she hadnâ€ ™ t .
And thatâ€ ™ s a troubling finding for anyone worried about a Trump presidency : it suggests the Democratsâ€ ™ likely nominee could have a problem in crucial manufacturing states .
A majority of Democrats and Republicans in Michigan have reported that recent trade deals have given people like them the shaft .
On the Democratic side , six in 10 Michigan voters thought trade takes away jobs and the majority of those voters supported Sanders ; on the Republican side , four in 10 thought trade costs the country jobs , and the majority of them supported Trump .
Sandersâ€ ™ and Trumpâ€ ™ s big wins in Michigan tonight , and those polling numbers in particular , should have Clinton very , very afraid ."
2016-03-09,"Broadly speaking , the 2016 US presidential election hasnâ€ ™ t changed from the way it looked 24 hours ago .
After votes have been counted in Michigan , Mississippi , Idaho and Hawaii , Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are still leading in the Republican and Democratic races to the White House .
But details matter here , and the results of last nightâ€ ™ s votes have shifted the viability of other contenders : leftwing firebrand Bernie Sanders hasnâ€ ™ t burned up yet , but Texas senator Ted Cruz may find his path to the nomination steeper than it seemed yesterday .
The Democratic race Sandersâ€ ™ victory over Clinton in Michigan represented a huge polling upset .
Every single poll since June put the former secretary of state ahead of the Vermont senator in the state ; an average of the last three polls had Clinton leading by 21 percentage points .
But right from the start of the night the race was incredibly close , with the candidates separated by just a couple of points .
While other states declared their winners with less than a quarter of the votes counted , in Michigan , Sanders was not announced as the Democratic victor until over 85 % of votes had been collected .
It is true that for Democrats , delegates are dished out in proportion to votes , so Sandersâ€ ™ s 49.9 % vote share only earned him 65 delegates compared to Hillaryâ€ ™ s 58 , but the Michigan results were crucial for other reasons .
After he was repeatedly slated to have little chance of winning , the Michigan victory gives Sanders the chance to claim that such criticisms are misplaced and that a vote for the Bern in the upcoming contests is not a wasted one .
Michiganâ€ ™ s results also suggest that Sandersâ€ ™ s â€œblack voter problemâ€ � might not be insurmountable .
Exit polling suggests that 30 % of black Democratic voters in the state opted for Sanders .
Thatâ€ ™ s a clear contrast to exit poll findings on Sandersâ€ ™ popularity â€ “ or lack of it
â€ “ among black Americans in other states that have voted this year .
If Sanders can win over non - white voters in the primaries to come , his delegate numbers could dramatically change .
Currently , Sanders has 571 of the 2,383 needed to win the nomination , while Clinton has 759 ; including the party luminaries known as superdelegates , she has 1,220
( those delegates can switch sides but are unlikely to do so ) .
Clintonâ€ ™ s base is made up of older voters who are more likely to describe themselves as moderate than liberal .
While Sanders has a chance of winning over black voters in some parts of the country , heâ€ ™ ll face a tougher task convincing those Clinton supporters to reconsider their options .
The Michigan Democratic result might well have limited long - term effects .
The deprivation and unemployment in some parts of Michigan ( which has been a Democratic blue state in the past six presidential elections ) mean that this is a part of the country that is particularly receptive to Sandersâ€ ™ messages on economic justice .
However , if polls prove wrong in other parts of the country with a similar profile to Michigan ( in particular Ohio and Illinois , which vote next Tuesday and together offer 341 delegates ) , then Sanders could have a real chance of challenging Clinton .
Or at least threatening to challenge her .
Even if Sanders can make up his delegate deficit , Clintonâ€ ™ s lead in superdelegates remains a huge obstacle .
In 2008 , those superdelegates were closely watched to see how they could change the close race between Clinton and Barack Obama .
But itâ€ ™ s rare for them to switch sides , and the fact that they are such important party figures ( governors , members of Congress , ex - presidents and members of the Democratic National Committee ) means that their support counts for a lot in affecting a candidateâ€ ™ s strength in the general election .
Despite his huge win in Michigan , the fact remains that Sanders has a lot of ground to recover if he wants to catch up with Clinton .
The Republican race Donald Trump had a successful night â€ “ he met , and then exceeded , expectations .
Claims about an anti - Trump surge ( based in part on spending by candidates on anti - Trump ads ) appear to have been premature .
Michigan in particular was a big win for the New York businessman .
Thatâ€ ™ s not just because the state offered 59 delegates ; itâ€ ™ s also because of who the individual voters were .
Michiganâ€ ™ s voting population is pretty similar to the national numbers in terms of age , income and education .
That could be good for Trump as candidates begin to think about shifting their rhetoric toward the general election .
Michigan is also meaningful because it brings Trump closer to the 1,237 delegates needed to get the nomination .
Currently the New York businessman has 458 .
However , there is also reason for Trump supporters to temper their enthusiasm over the Michigan results : he was pretty likely to have won there .
Polling averages ahead of tonightâ€ ™ s results showed the candidate with 37 % support , ahead of Kasich in second place on 25 % .
For Trump to really secure his victory , he needs to make sure that his wins tonight translate into support in the states voting next Tuesday â€ “ Florida , Illinois , Missouri , North Carolina and Ohio â€ “ which will be more important in terms of delegates , most of them being winner - takes - all rather than proportional .
Success could be all about messaging , something at which , so far , the Trump campaign has proven adept ..
But the underdogs matter in the Republican race too .
Kasich had an exceptional night , taking 24.3 % of votes in Michigan .
It seems that at least some of that success is down to former Marco Rubio voters reconsidering their options .
After he saw a brief rise in support at the start of February , polls suggest that the Florida senator has fallen again in popularity .
Last night , for the second time , Rubio failed to pick up a single delegate .
With less than half the number of delegates that Cruz has , Rubio now has a slim chance of winning the nomination .
The real question , though , is whether Republicans are any closer to having a contested convention â€ “ in which delegates would be free to vote again , potentially even for new candidates , after the primaries failed to produce a clear winner â€ “ as a result of last nightâ€ ™ s vote .
Despite Cruzâ€ ™ s win in Idaho , thatâ€ ™ s still not clear .
However , things will probably become much more clear a week from now when those five states with large delegate numbers up for grabs hold their primary elections .
Watch this space ."
2016-03-09,"It seems likely that there will be a female president of the US well before there is a self - professed atheist in the Oval Office .
Ted Cruz declared last year that someone who does not begin every day on â€œhis kneesâ€ � ( sic ) is not fit to be commander - in - chief .
Atheism is controversial , in the US as in many other countries around the world .
But both its detractors and its supporters tend to portray lack of faith in a divine power as a possibility or danger available only in modern times .
Those in the Cruz camp often view atheism as a marker and a cause of the degeneration of contemporary society ; Cruzâ€ ™ s father famously declared that it is the cause of sexual abuse .
The defenders of religion point to the fact that all human cultures throughout history seem to have had religious beliefs and practices , and therefore religion is sometimes said to be an essential feature of human nature .
Those on the other side may celebrate â€œourâ€ � freedom from the superstitions that were rampant before the Enlightenment .
Christopher Hitchens argued that â€œreligion comes from the period of human prehistory when nobody â€ “ not even the mighty Democritus who concluded that all matter was made of atoms â€ “ had the slightest idea what was going
onâ€
� .
Tim
Whitmarshâ€
™ s
brilliant new book about ancient atheism makes a compelling case that various forms of religious disbelief have been with us for the past two and a half millennia , with greater and lesser degrees of cultural prominence .
Atheism has had a distinguished and varied lineage .
It seems likely that doubt about religion is just as old as religion itself , although there is no way to prove what people believed or did not believe in cultures that have left us no literary evidence .
Whitmarsh makes the illuminating observation that modern , post - Enlightenment atheism has a particular social function : it draws authority away from the clergy , towards the secular â€œpriestsâ€ � of science .
In the ancient world , the conflict between science and religion did not exist , at least not in these terms .
But it does not follow that nobody in antiquity ever questioned the traditional stories about the gods , which were often patently ridiculous .
Classical scholars may turn to Whitmarshâ€ ™ s book , as I did , with questions about whether the term â€œatheismâ€ � is really the right one for discussing pre - Judaeo - Christian religious doubts and resistance to religion .
It is an academic commonplace to distinguish between the â€œorthopraxyâ€ � of Graeco - Roman religion â€ “ the focus on collective rituals , sacrifices and festivals â€ “ and the â€œorthodoxyâ€ � of modern monotheistic religions .
No ancient Greek or Roman ever recited a Creed .
Besides , in classical Greek , the word atheos ( â€œnot - godâ€ � ) is usually used to mean â€œgodlessâ€ � or â€œagainst - the - godsâ€ � , rather than a person who does not believe that gods exist .
But Whitmarsh builds a case that stories about â€œbattling the godsâ€ � are actually ways of articulating doubts about traditional religious teaching .
He argues that classicists have gone too far in presenting ancient religion as primarily concerned only with action , not faith .
As he rightly notes , this historical claim relies heavily on public sources , such as inscriptions , which may teach us a lot about ritual practices but much less about what individual worshippers thought was true and false .
Public documents can only give the â€œofficial , ideologically sanctioned versions of eventsâ€ � .
For this reason , much of Whitmarshâ€ ™ s work is a careful teasing out of the literary and philosophical sources , including those that exist only in fragmentary form , as he searches for hints of people in antiquity who questioned the godsâ€ ™ existence .
The ancient Greeks certainly did not assume that the gods are likable or lovable , and hostility to the gods is a familiar trope in Greek literature .
The Homeric poems â€ “ which were never treated with the reverence afforded to the holy books of the Islamic or Jewish traditions , but which were by far the best known texts of Graeco - Roman antiquity â€ “ depict anthropomorphic gods who are very much of this world , and who interact with humans , even fighting with them on the battlefield .
Battling the gods was a common enough trope in the Greek imagination that they had a word for it :
theomachia .
One might think that stories about gods as threats to humans must imply a strong belief in their existence .
But Whitmarsh argues that theomachy stories express â€œa kind of atheism , through the narrative medium of mythâ€ � .
One key example is the archaic tale of Salmoneus , who claimed to be Zeus , demanded sacrifices to be offered to himself , and created thunder by dragging kettles around behind his chariot .
Whitmarsh suggests that this story raises disturbing questions for believers in the gods : â€œIf gods can be fashioned by mortal imitation ,
how real can they be?â€ �
One may still balk at the idea that this is really â€œatheismâ€ � in the modern sense .
Even the pre - Socratics of the sixth and fifth centuries BC , who are usually seen as the precursors to modern scientific and philosophical inquiry , can not all be identified as atheists in any straightforward sense .
Xenophanes of Colophon declared that â€œAfricans say that their gods are snub - nosed and black , Thracians that they are blue - eyed and red - hairedâ€ � : but pointing to the limitations of Greek concepts of anthropomorphic deities is not quite the same as denying the existence of all gods .
In the fifth century BC , we reach more convincing examples of people who can be categorised as atheists in the strong modern sense of the word .
Protagoras , an important and influential sophist ( â€œwisdom - teacherâ€ � ) , declared at the start of his book On the Gods , â€œI can not know whether they existâ€ � .
Whitmarsh shows that this claim was closer to outright atheism than agnosticism , since Protagoras went on to argue that what can not be perceived does not exist .
Another sophist , Prodicus , claimed that â€œthe gods of popular belief do not existâ€ � .
In the later Hellenistic period , the third and second centuries BC , the nature and existence or nonexistence of the gods was reconsidered by many schools of philosophy .
Stoics identified god with nature and fate .
Epicureans had a slippery , perhaps confused notion of gods who were composed of a different , thinner type of matter from all other entities in the universe , and lived â€œbetween the worldsâ€ � , affecting nothing but dreams and the imagination .
Sceptics argued that all beliefs rest on â€œshaky foundationsâ€ � , including belief in the gods .
Whitmarsh rightly underlines the central importance of ancient Scepticism in the history of atheism ; these philosophers came up with a hugely influential set of arguments against a vast range of religious claims .
Carneades , an early leader of the school , used a form of â€œheapâ€ � argument ( a thousand grains is a heap ; take one away , itâ€ ™ s still a heap ; but one grain is not a heap ; so when does it cease to be a heap ? ) .
His argument relies on the Greek assumption that the gods belong to this world , rather than being a different order of being , and he poses the question : are nymphs and satyrs gods ?
If not , where do we draw the line ?
Some have interpreted Carneades â€ “ whose work does not survive first - hand â€ “ as saying only that traditional religion is questionable , rather than that gods do not exist .
But Whitmarsh makes the case that Carneades wanted to prove that belief in the gods is logically impossible ; the idea that he was only attacking current ( Stoic ) beliefs about gods comes from the much later , and highly partial , testimony of Cicero .
Whitmarsh , who is primarily a Greek literature specialist , spends much more time with the Greeks than the Romans , and treats Greek religion more sympathetically .
But he has a big and provocative story to sketch once he reaches the world of the emperors .
He makes a connection between the disparate , scattered world of the Greek city states and Greek polytheism , which was more a set of local cults than a centralised religious system .
With the centralising power of Rome , religion also became more centralised and politicised â€ “ as did , Whitmarsh argues , atheism .
Since the Romans tended to equate the success of their own empire with divine providence , scepticism about Rome and scepticism about the gods now went together .
( Scepticism about the gods was good , it provided a sphere for political dissent for people who wanted to criticise Rome implicitly . )
But the â€œdreamâ€ � of being able to â€œimagine the possibility of a world that had left religions behindâ€ � lasted for only two or three hundred years .
As the Roman empire became increasingly difficult to govern , there was a strong motive for those in power to find an ideological force that could hold the people under imperial control .
Christianity proved particularly useful for this purpose .
The Theodosian code was instituted in the fifth century CE , and represented a vast shift away from the old model of Graeco - Roman polytheism .
Now , religion was not an infinitely expandable series of cults dedicated to multiple different divinities ; all doubt was heresy , and all beliefs except Nicene Christianity were punishable by death .
As Whitmarsh insists , individuals probably continued to have doubts about religion throughout late antiquity and the middle ages ; but â€œthey were invisible to dominant society and so have left no trace in the historical recordâ€ � .
This is an invigorating , urgent book that makes an important contribution to a central contemporary debate .
One of its chief virtues is that it underlines the gulf between the Christian and pre - Christian eras , without presenting antiquity as an atheistâ€ ™ s utopia .
There were no ancient equivalents of wars using religion as a premise ( the crusades or jihad ) .
But doubters were put on trial in antiquity , and some were executed , for instance under the Athenian law against â€œimpietyâ€ �
â€ “ including Socrates , who was accused of â€œnot believing in the gods of the cityâ€ � .
Whitmarsh also reminds us that disbelief comes in many varieties .
Democritus the atomist â€ “ who lived in the fifth century BC â€ “ seems to have had some kind of belief in the gods : he thought that people see gods in their dreams , although they have no explanatory function for the workings of the material universe .
Gods exist , but they are irrelevant for scientific inquiry .
Democritus was not an atheist in quite the same way as Hitchens , but he was no fool , and he was certainly not brainwashed by religion .

2016-03-10,"Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have joined 13 other GOP senators to introduce a Senate resolution calling on Barack Obama to change nearly eight years of policy and open GuantÃ¡namo Bay to new detainees captured from the Islamic State .
The move follows the capture of Sleiman Daoud al - Afari , a man described as Isisâ€ ™ s chemical weapons chief , whose apprehension has reignited the political controversy over the future of the detention facility .
Hours after the introduction of the resolution , the Pentagon announced it had already transferred the alleged senior Isis figure to Iraqi government custody .
The Senate resolution , spearheaded by Steve Daines of Montana , comes as the administration faces a dilemma that has vexed senior Pentagon officials and military officers : what to do with the battlefield captures that will inevitably occur as Obama escalates the war against Isis while he also makes his final push to close GuantÃ¡namo .
While the resolution will have no binding legal force on Obama , it displays the latest argument from the GOP - led Senate to block the White Houseâ€ ™ s
GuantÃ¡namo closure plan â€ “ a central aspect of which involves winning the support of Congress for a proposal it has vigorously and consistently resisted .
â€œAll individuals captured by the United States during combat operations against Isil that meet the criteria by their affiliation with Isil must be detained outside the United States and its territories and should be transferred to United States Naval Station , GuantÃ¡namo Bay , â€ � the proposed Senate resolution reads in part .
Isil is another name for Isis .
Cruz , who claims he is the last candidate who can stop Donald Trump becoming the Republican nominee , urged Congress to exercise its â€œconstitutional authorityâ€ � , a reference to Article 1 , Section 8â€ ™ s empowerment of Congress to â€œmake rules concerning captures on land and waterâ€ � .
A statement from Cruz accompanying the resolution announcement began : â€œJihadists who seek to kill Americans should not be brought to American soil.â€ � Obamaâ€ ™ s longstanding plans for emptying GuantÃ¡namo of its 91 remaining occupants include convincing Congress to remove a legal ban on transferring GuantÃ¡namo detainees to the mainland United States for either continued detention or trial before civilian courts and military tribunals .
Rubio , whose campaign for the Republican nomination is in dire straits , stated : â€œThere should be no confusion in the minds of our enemies that , if captured , they will be sent to the detention facility in GuantÃ¡namo Bay to be interrogated.â€ �
Various military commanders have for years expressed discomfort that Obamaâ€ ™ s commitment to emptying GuantÃ¡namo has inhibited them from capturing terrorist suspects beyond the declared battlefield of Afghanistan .
Those captures have been the exception , and drone strikes and other lethal attacks have been the rule .
Now that Iraq , with Syria , is once again a theater of war â€ “ though undeclared as such by Congress â€ “
US military officers are sounding alarms over the absence of clear rules surrounding detentions policy , particularly for long - term detentions and interrogations .
Unlike the GOP senators , they have not yet called for Obama to make GuantÃ¡namo Bay an option for those detentions .
Gen Joseph Votel , Obamaâ€ ™ s choice to oversee the anti - Isis war at US Central Command and a veteran leader of the elite special operations forces that conduct capture raids , raised the issue with the Senate this week as it considers his nomination .
â€œThe ability to detain individuals is essential â€ “ a fundamental [ tenet ] of fighting and winning the current fight ,
â€ �
Votel wrote in a statement for the Senate armed services committee for the record , citing the importance of interrogations to gather â€œotherwise unobtainable actionable intelligenceâ€ � .
â€œRelated and pertinent is the development of an effective long - term policy for the detainment of enemy combatants which would allow holding certain enemy combatants indefinitely to fuel increased exploitation , â€ �
Votel continued .
Yet there is little indication that Pentagon officials are moving from their current position on detentions .
Last month , US special operations forces captured Sleiman Daoud al - Afari , who has been described as Isisâ€ ™ s chemical weapons chief , and had been holding him in what defense officials describe as a temporary detention center .
On Thursday , the Pentagon announced it had transferred him to Iraqi government custody that morning , following what it described as a successful interrogation .
â€œThrough Dawud , the coalition learned details about Isilâ€ ™ s chemical weapon facilities and production , as well as the people involved .
The information has resulted in multiple coalition airstrikes that have disrupted and degraded Isilâ€ ™ s ability to produce chemical weapons and will continue to inform our operations in the future , â€ � Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said .
In his statement to the Senate , Votel also appeared to endorse that approach : â€œDetaining and exploiting enemy personnel and materiel prior to turning them over to partner nations is critical â€ “ we must retain this policy going forward , â€ �
he said .
Despite the resolutionâ€ ™ s introduction , the White House is holding to its current policy of attempting to achieve the closure of GuantÃ¡namo via Congress .
â€œThe administration looks forward to working with Congress to identify an appropriate facility for future detention , to lifting the statutory prohibitions , and to identifying the precise costs associated with doing so , â€ � said Myles Caggins , detentions spokesman at the National Security Council .
It is unclear when the Senate might vote on the resolution .
An aide to Daines suggested that it might take months , until the Senate appropriations committee considers a military construction bill that might be the next opportunity for GuantÃ¡namo - related legislation .
Admiral Kurt Tidd , the new chief of US Southern Command , the military command overseeing GuantÃ¡namo , pledged to continue what he described as professional and humane detentions at the facility â€œuntil the very last detainee steps on an airplane and departs the islandâ€ � .
Kidd praised his forces for their â€œutmost discipline , professionalism and integrityâ€ � during a hearing of the Senate armed services committee on Thursday ."
2016-03-10,"Donald Trump is not really exceptional among current Republican presidential candidates .
He is the one with the brightest plumage , of course , and the one who has had long experience at cultivating celebrity .
If Trump seems strangely incapable of consistency except in the matter of walling out and deporting immigrants , somber Ted Cruz is lurking nearby to alarm us with his ideological purity .
If Trump is his own invention , there is Rubio , the polished creature of hired advisors and their moment - to - moment calculations .
The only satisfaction to be found in a Trump win lies in the fact that the others have lost , and lost badly .
On the other hand , Trumpâ€ ™ s bluster distracts attention from the othersâ€ ™ stated positions , so if one of his competitors manages finally to make the case , to the public or the party , that he is least objectionable , the claim might well be groundless .
Trump and the others are the product of the souring of the party system .
Someone should point out , in these days when the constitution is so constantly and pietistically invoked , that political parties are not mentioned in the constitution , and that the prescient founders warned emphatically against them for reasons that should be clear to us now .
In recent years the Republicans have hardened into a faction , by which I mean a congeries of population groups who define themselves primarily as the adversaries of Democrats .
Traditionally the parties had , for the most part , served as advocates for regions and interests that endorsed them by their votes â€
“ farmers , workers , business people and so on .
Since Nixon , the southern strategy and the culture wars , the tactics of the Republicans have been to stigmatize the Democrats by association with disfavored groups , so that their championing of the rights of minorities , and of women , of immigrants and the poor , together with their support of marriage equality , triggered the kind of quasi - moral distaste many people the world over feel toward the disfavored .
This might seem to be at odds with the Christianity the party so loudly claims for itself .
But it does explain what might otherwise seem puzzling , that the many Evangelicals among them are perfectly wiling to overlook every transgression in Trumpâ€ ™ s past and every crudeness and cruelty in his present conduct , and also to forgive in anticipation whatever future sin might be entailed in breaking up immigrant families or fomenting conflict abroad .
They ask nothing of him except that he win .
The press describes the Trump phenomenon as a rejection of the political establishment .
Who exactly the establishment are at this point is difficult to say .
The supreme court , at the moment a sadly politicized institution , decided , to the delight of our so - called conservatives , that money is speech , therefore that constraints on its influence on elections were unconstitutional .
So now , when some drab functionary presents himself as speaking for the party , he is no more than scurf on a sea of money handed out by any opinionated casino magnate .
The party has effectively marginalized itself .
In fact , the Republican situation is such a tangle of unintended consequences that it is impossible to sort it all out , or to make the attempt without laughing .
They re - jiggered their primary system to enhance party influence in choosing a candidate , and Trump , the great orange - haired Unintended Consequence , has played their innovations like a fiddle .
For years they have gerrymandered districts to make them â€œsafeâ€ � for their representatives in Congress , thereby incubating a culture of politicians who are too odd and extreme â€ “ and white â€ “ to appeal to a national electorate .
Their restrictions on voting can be expected to have the same effect .
In other words , they have seized one kind of power at the cost of another , and in the process exacerbated every demographic problem that threatens their future as a national party .
True , their strategy of party discipline , which may make their congressional leadership the nearest thing they have to an establishment , is so potent that the senator from Kentucky can tell the senator from Maine how she is to vote , or that she must not vote .
So much for representative government .
The joke is , of course , that this rigid discipline is all in the service of paralysis .
They will not so much as take note of the Presidentâ€ ™ s nomination to fill a vacant seat on the supreme court , which he is constitutionally required to make .
This will leave the court divided four to four , paralyzed , in all probability , which is clearly nothing that perturbs these persons still quaintly referred to as lawmakers .
Perhaps the public is exasperated to the point that it is enjoying a kind of catharsis , the indiscriminate smashing of things as performance art .
Trump will probably learn that ridicule is an effective servant but a terrible master , since he is objectively ridiculous , his career is murky at best and the campaign will be passionate and long .
His supposed implausibility as a candidate actually sheltered him for months from scrutiny by the press , who nevertheless have showered him with attention .
He is alarming as well as absurd , stirring and stoking the worst impulses in the electorate .
But then this is only a darkening of the atmosphere we have lived in since Nixon , as fear and resentment began to be commodified very profitably by the likes of Fox News and Rush Limbaugh .
Trump has stepped right out of the fusion of news and entertainment , out of the gothic fantasy world of sinister foreigners and imminent catastrophe , a fact that may have made him less bizarre to their viewers and listeners than the rest of us were ready to understand .
We can not know , and I shudder to think , how deeply these influences have conditioned public consciousness .
Their penetration of the Republican electorate â€ “ their sympathies are always Republican â€ “ are on display in the campaigns of Cruz and Rubio as well as Trump , since , in turning right , the party stepped into their arms .
This is another calculation gone bad .
Nativism and resentment have a dangerous momentum of their own .
Now party leaders are scrambling to put distance between themselves and the Ku Klux Klan .
We have a measure of their effect in the panic felt in some quarters by the mere fact of President Obama , a wise , humane and moderate soul if ever there was one , who has come almost to the end of his two terms , having put the country in a vastly better state than he found it in , and this despite everything his opposition could do to thwart the will of the majorities who elected him .
Watching Trumpâ€ ™ s victories mount up as I write , I comfort myself with the fact that all that red overspreading the map means only that he has won pluralities among the minority of voters who take part in primaries .
It may well mean that the Republican party will indeed be saddled with a candidate the national electorate is certain to find unacceptable .
In any case , American elections are long and grueling , just as they ought to be .
We will spend months learning how things are with us .
This is good and necessary , especially now when divisions in the society are deepening .
They are deepening not only because of the stresses of the new economy , which a functioning government would meliorate , or the threats brought on by global disorder , which must be managed and will be , but because fear , anxiety and resentment are the stock in trade of important media and the politicians allied or symbiotic with them ."

2016-03-11,"Donald Trump hopes to make a decisive move towards the 1,237 delegates he needs to lock up the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday , when Florida , Illinois , Missouri , North Carolina , Ohio and the Northern Mariana Islands all vote , with a total of 367 delegates up for grabs as the contest moves to a winner - takes - all phase in many states .
Texas senator Ted Cruz is attempting to encourage Republicans to rally round him as the â€œstop Trumpâ€ � candidate .
But increasingly the GOP establishment have been floating the idea of preventing the New York businessman from winning the nomination not at the ballot box but in a â€œcontested conventionâ€ � , which would bring another candidate â€ “ Florida senator Marco Rubio , Ohio governor John Kasich and 2012 GOP duo Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan
have all been floated â€ “ in over the heads of the voters at the partyâ€ ™ s July convention .
â€œReagan and Ford battled it out in a contested convention , â€ �
Cruz told Fox News this week .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what conventions are
for.â€ �
For the first time since the invention of social media and 24-hour cable news , a major party may decide its presidential nominee on the convention floor .
But what exactly is a contested convention ?
Smoke - filled rooms
In the dark ages of American politics , the elaborate politicking of a presidential primary was once condensed into a political convention .
For decades , instead of a long public process during which candidates traipsed from Iowa to New Hampshire and onwards across the country for series of primaries and caucuses , presidential nominees were chosen in overheated convention halls and the smoke - filled rooms in adjacent hotels .
However , as more states instituted primaries to select their delegates , a process that accelerated greatly in the 1970s , the conventions receded in importance .
The last political convention to go to more than one ballot was the Democratsâ€ ™ in 1952 , when they nominated Adlai Stevenson .
And the last one where there was even a shred of suspense â€ “ as Cruz recalled â€ “ was held by the Republicans in 1976 when Ronald Reagan forced Gerald Ford into a primary contest in an unsuccessful attempt to snatch the nomination from the incumbent presidentâ€
™ s grip .
Reagan would have to wait until 1980 before becoming his partyâ€ ™ s candidate and winning two terms as president .
The Republican partyâ€ ™ s rules require that the winning candidate for the presidential nomination receives the support of a majority of delegates at the party convention , which this year will be held in Cleveland in July .
With 2,473 delegates attending the convention , this means the nominee needs the support of 1,237 of those attending .
However , with four candidates still in the race , even Trump , the frontrunner , may not reach this threshold , and the partyâ€ ™ s byzantine rules then create the potential for anarchy to ensue .
The problems come in several forms .
The first is that since conventions have been long thought to be vestigial parts of American politics , candidatesâ€ ™ campaigns are not fully prepared for the delegate chase â€ “ a full scale 50-state scramble .
Campaigns have to take care to not just make the ballot in every state but to fill their slates of delegates with names and ensure that those delegates pledged to them are actual supporters and not what veteran Republican strategist John Yob calls â€œsupporters in name onlyâ€
� , or Sinos .
Yob , who guided delegate strategy for Rand Paulâ€ ™ s failed presidential campaign this year and is also the author of Campaign Chaos , a book on a potential contested convention , told the Guardian that one of the key tells for a successful delegate effort was â€œhow effective campaigns are at keeping Sinos from being electedâ€ � .
Some delegates could ignore primary results In addition , in many states delegates are in fact selected in an entirely separate process from the primaries currently being carried out under such vast media scrutiny .
In the event of a contested convention , the primary votersâ€ ™ decisions in such states like Michigan and Virginia potentially could be completely ignored by the delegates .
According to the prevailing interpretation of current Republican National Committee rules , though , delegates are bound on the first ballot by the results of their stateâ€ ™ s nominating contest .
However , after that , many ( the rules vary state by state ) can do what they want .
Furthermore , the convention itself decides what rules govern it , and delegates are not bound when it comes to votes on changing the rules .
The common belief is that the candidate most under threat from a contested convention would be Donald Trump .
The Republican frontrunner is a political outsider who is viewed as anathema by many in the GOP establishment .
The hope among some in the Republican party is that even if Trump achieves a clear majority , delegates formally bound to the real estate mogul on the first ballot would in fact vote to change the rules and then defect .
However , Barry Bennett , a top Trump operative dealing with much of the delegate process for his campaign , told the Guardian : â€œOur theory all along is that we have to get delegates that are not part of politics of usual and [ are ] 100 % loyal to us.â€ �
In addition , up to 112 delegates
â€ “ many of whom come from territories and not states â€ “ will arrive at the convention without any obligation to support a particular candidate .
As Yob noted , delegations such as those from Guam , American Samoa and the Virgin Islands ( where he is standing to be a delegate ) will play a crucial role as a result .
These unbound delegates , though , should not be interpreted as agents of the party establishment who will act in tandem to block Trump .
As Bennett noted : â€œI know what these delegates want .
They want a deal .
They are going to act in their own self - interest , and not in the interest of Rubio , Cruz or Romney .
Itâ€ ™ s like herding cats .
This notion that they will all line up together , itâ€ ™ s just ludicrous.â€
�
Bennett , the Trump operative , who previously served as Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s campaign manager on an effort where delegates from the territories were assiduously courted , was also scornful of the idea that the unpledged delegates would â€œlay down , put their self - interest aside to vote for an establishment candidateâ€ � .
In addition , all of the delegates from three states â€ “ Colorado , North Dakota and Wyoming â€ “ will be unbound , as will portions of the delegations from Louisiana and Oklahoma .
The result is that internal machinations in obscure contests such as the Colorado state convention in April could be as important as far better - covered events such as Super Tuesday .
Major obstacle â€ ¦ for anyone but Trump Campaigns also face another obstacle in Rule 40b of the Republican party , which states that candidates need to win the support of a majority of the delegations in eight different states or territories to have their name placed into nomination at a convention .
So far , Trump has won seven states under this rule , Cruz has won four and Rubio has only one .
Party insiders have long assumed that the rule , implemented solely to block libertarian
Ron Paulâ€ ™ s name from being placed into nomination in 2012 , would be modified before the 2016 convention .
If and until it is , however , it serves as a major obstacle for candidates seeking to have their names considered on the first ballot .
( The Cruz campaign dispatched an operative to Guam in August under the assumption that Rule 40b might still apply and to gain a leg up . )
How a contested convention would play out is still unclear .
One Republican operative familiar with the delegate process claimed to the Guardian that â€œCruz has the highest - quality delegatesâ€ � .
The operative ranked Trump second , Rubio third and Kasich last in this regard .
The Republican noted that while Trump â€œfiles more delegates than any other campaignâ€ � , the impression left is that â€œhe sends out a mass email [ to supporters ] and encourages everyone to applyâ€ � â€ “ in other words , that he carries out little checking into whether his delegates are truly loyal .
Would it damage the GOP ?
Almost every recent example of a contested convention has ended badly for the party concerned .
â€œWhen you look back in history , highly contested conventions tended to be a disadvantage to the party that had them , â€ �
Yob said â€ “ although he noted there were exceptions , the most recent being Franklin Delano Rooseveltâ€ ™ s
White House victory after a multi - ballot convention in 1932 .
Yet because of the unique nature of Trump supporters , many of whom are new to the Republican party , a contested convention in 2016 may be less damaging than might be assumed .
Rick Tyler , a former top aide to Cruz , told the Guardian a contested convention â€œwould cause minimal damage , and the reason I say that is because a significant portion of Trumpâ€ ™ s voters are not party peopleâ€ � .
They were not â€œthe people who show up to county committee meetings , state committee meetingsâ€ � , he said .
â€œThese arenâ€ ™ t our folks.â€
� â€˜You would have a revoltâ€ ™
To Tyler , if no one gets 1,237 delegates , â€œTrump will be on equal footing with everybody elseâ€
� .
In his view , â€œeveryone who wants to put their name forth for nomination would be on equal footing and
then â€ ¦
letâ€
™ s assume they go through the process of casting the first ballot and then all the deal - making begins.â€
�
However , he did see potential for a contested convention to greatly weaken the party .
â€œIf the establishment tries to put in a Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan or someone like that because you would have a revolt , â€ � said Tyler .
â€œNow conservatives would be aligned with the Trump people.â€ �
But top Republican operatives are still skeptical that a contested convention will come to pass .
Stuart Stevens , a top consultant for Romney in 2012 and author of The Innocent Have Nothing To Fear , a novel about a contested convention , noted that Trump is likely to win every delegate in New York and New Jersey and is skeptical about any scenario where the frontrunner does not get to the magic 1,237 threshold â€ “ provided he wins Floridaâ€ ™ s winner - take - all primary on Tuesday .
Stevens thought if Trump was under 1,000 delegates at the time of the convention , â€œhe could be beatâ€ � .
Cruz has called the possibility of a contested convention â€œthe fevered talk of the Washington
establishmentâ€ � .
But Stevens dismissed this : â€œThe guy who is running second saying I think
itâ€ ™ s dishonorable to win in overtime â€ ¦ Real men donâ€ ™ t kick field goals.â€

In 1924 , HL Mencken wrote of that yearâ€ ™ s Democratic national convention : â€œThere is something about a national convention that makes it as fascinating as a revival or a hanging .
It is vulgar , it is ugly , it is stupid , it is tedious , it is hard upon both the higher cerebral centers and the gluteus maximus , and yet it is somehow charming.â€ �
Yet that description sums up an era in which the entire modern year - long primary process was consolidated into a few days .
As Clarke Reed , the former chair of the Mississippi Republican party who played a key role in the last contested convention in 1976 , told the Guardian far more laconically , a contested convention this year is â€œlikely to lead to all kinds of games being playedâ€ � ."
2016-03-12,"Hillary Clinton added to her primary victories and Ted Cruz took an early lead in Wyoming on Saturday , as the state , two territories and Washington DC doled out delegates in Republican and Democratic races .
Clinton won the first - ever Democratic caucuses on the Northern Mariana Islands , with 102 total votes to 65 votes for Bernie Sanders .
Clinton won four delegates , increasing her pledged delegate lead over Sanders to 223 ; an additional 22 votes were cast for â€œuncommittedâ€ � .
The tiny Pacific island represents Clintonâ€ ™ s 14th primary victory to Sandersâ€ ™ nine and was the only Democratic contest held this weekend .
On Guam , where Republicans held their primary this weekend , Ted Cruz picked up a single delegate .
The big winner , however , was reported as â€œuncommittedâ€ � .
Guamâ€ ™ s unconventional system means that its six convention delegates do not have to announce their preferred candidate for two weeks , so that they can hear from all four Republican presidential campaigns .
In the run - up to the vote , Cruz sent a letter promising the islanders that he would fight for their future .
â€œItâ€ ™ s
Guamâ€ ™ s time , â€ � he wrote .
â€œGuam is of great strategic importance to the United States .
It is time we treated it as such.â€ � Marco Rubio , meanwhile , sent a missive calling for a new generation of leaders , John Kasich stressed veteranâ€ ™ s health benefits , and Donald Trump vowed : â€œNobody will do the job that I can do .
And on top of that , Iâ€ ™ m going to win , so
itâ€ ™ s one of those things.â€
�
In Wyoming , another state with an unconventional system for choosing delegates , caucusing began for a Republican candidate .
Ted Cruz appeared to be headed for victory there , winning at least three delegates and nearly 60 % of the vote with more than 13 of 23 precincts reporting .
The state will decide 12 delegates on Saturday , another 14 delegates in a state convention in April , and three in a decision by party leaders .
Rubio trailed Cruz in Wyoming with around 30 % of the vote , with Trump in third at 18 % .
Adding to the complicated nature of Wyomingâ€ ™ s primary process , the state has unusual rules about when its delegates go to this summerâ€ ™ s Republican convention , where a nominee will be anointed by the party .
The 29 delegates will go to the convention officially unbound to any candidate , though identified by a preferred choice .
Only North Dakota and the territory of Guam have similar rules , which mean their delegates do not have to vote on the first ballot according to the results of their votersâ€ ™ elections .
If none of the candidates reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination , these unbound delegates would be fought over tooth and claw in the contested convention that a few campaigns want to create .
Cruz and Marco Rubio have tried to woo territories with an eye to the convention , which requires candidates to win a majority in eight states or territories to have their name put into contention .
Rubio won Puerto Rico by more than 50 % last week , earning the commonwealthâ€ ™ s 23 delegates .
But he has only won a single state , Minnesota , compared with Cruzâ€ ™ s four states and Trumpâ€ ™ s seven .
Americans who live in Guam , Puerto Rico or the Northern Mariana Islands can not vote in the general election .
Both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are nearly 6,000 miles away from Californiaâ€ ™ s coast , and 15 hours ahead of eastern local time .
Slightly fewer than 54,000 people live on the islands , according to the 2010 Census , and about 165,000 live on Guam .
Republicans also voted in Washington DC , which has 19 delegates â€ “ as many as Hawaii â€ “ though results were not immediately clear .
Registered Republicans make up only about 6 % of Washington DCâ€ ™ s voters , though its delegates often include former officials from the Reagan and Bush administrations .
In the last two presidential primaries , fewer than 6,000 people turned out to vote , awarding Mitt Romney 70 % of the vote in 2012 and John McCain 68 % in 2008 ."
2016-03-12,"Many Democrats fear the prospect of a Donald Trump in the Oval Office because they donâ€ ™ t know what the bombastic businessman would do there .
But the prospect of his top rival , Ted Cruz , in the White House frightens many far more because they know exactly what he would do there .
The Texas senator is running second to Trump in the race for the Republican nomination : seven states to Trumpâ€ ™ s 15 , roughly 29 % of the votes to 35 % , and about 100 delegates behind the self - proclaimed billionaire in the race to 1,237 , which would give either man the nomination outright .
Cruz is the underdog but , in this most unpredictable of election years , he still has a fighting chance .
Could he save the Republican party , and the many Americans horrified at the prospect of the brash Trump in the White House ?
Not quite .
Cruz is a hardline conservative despised within his own party , and many Democrats and establishment Republicans find the ideologue even more distasteful than Trump , whom they say lacks any principles beyond making deals .
Cruzâ€ ™ s dedication to conservative principles , regardless of consequences , has alienated many in Washington who see him as inflexible .
In return , the Texas senator , a devotee of Ronald Reagan , has disdained every Republican nominee since the 40th president , saying each failed to be a true â€œReagan conservativeâ€ � .
In Washington , Republican senator Lindsey Graham , a vocal Cruz critic and former presidential rival , has voiced the anxieties in his party , saying it had gone â€œbatshit crazyâ€ � .
He even joked darkly : â€œIf you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate , and the trial was in the Senate , nobody would convict you.â€
�
But even Graham has started to concede Cruz is a lesser evil to Trump .
He told reporters this week it is â€œincreasingly more clear to me that Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trumpâ€ � .
Across the aisle , many liberals and Democratic voters have similar anxieties about the Texas senator .
Although Trump is seen as an offensive opportunist who has stoked racially charged violence , Cruz is regarded as a true believer who is ready to reverse decades of liberal initiatives .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not as if thereâ€ ™ s a massive difference between Mr Trumpâ€ ™ s position on immigration and Mr Cruzâ€ ™ s position on immigration , â€ � Barack Obama observed this week .
â€œMr
Trump might just be more provocative in terms of how he says it , but the actual positions arenâ€ ™ t that different.â€ � More bluntly , Neil Sroka , spokesman for the activist group Democracy for America , called them both â€œawfulâ€ � , though â€œitâ€ ™ s a different kind of awful.â€
�
The principle of electing Trump is worse , he added , but the end result might actually be better .
â€œIf Trump wins , America has really gone to hell , but heâ€ ™ s more malleable and such a narcissist that he might get deals done in any way he can , â€ � he said .
â€œCruz , armed with a Republican House and Senate , could be like a rightwing demagogue weâ€ ™ ve never seen , worse than Ronald Reagan .
He could be way more dangerous than Trump.â€ �
But itâ€ ™ s this ideological consistency that appeals to his supporters as well .
Congressman Mark Meadows , who has endorsed Cruz , described him to the Guardian as â€œthe same guy in private as he is in publicâ€ � .
He noted some of his colleagues will be â€œthe ultimate conservativeâ€ � in public but , in private , they will behave much differently .
Cruz does not change , Meadows said .
He â€œtalks the talk and walks the walkâ€ � .
In contrast to Trump , Meadows enthused that a potential Cruz administration would reduce the power of the executive branch and have a â€œmore balanced foreign policyâ€ � .
A New Yorker , Trump has struggled to convince Republicans that he is a true conservative .
Critics have pointed to his disdain for limited government , liberal positions that he has once held on issues such as abortion and gun control and his past donations to Democrats â€ “ including Hillary Clinton , the likely nominee , who also attended his third wedding .
Those three marriages â€ “ and boasts of promiscuity â€ “ similarly make him an incongruous match for many evangelical voters .
To a secular European , meanwhile , a Cruz speech roils with the puritanical fire and brimstone of 17th century New England , a world divided between angelic good and satanic evil .
A preacherâ€ ™ s son and a measured public speaker who drops his voice for raw effect , Cruz is fond of quoting Reaganâ€
™ s
â€œbanner of bold colors , no pastel shadesâ€ � , and claims that he will restore American leadership in the world after Obama , just as Reagan did after Jimmy Carter .
Cruz first became a national figure by leading a 2013 government shutdown as a fight against Obamaâ€ ™ s healthcare reforms .
On the campaign trail he revels , like Trump , in his role as an anti - establishment candidate railing against special interests in Washington and uses the disdain with which many in the nationâ€ ™ s capital view him as a selling point .
A former supreme court clerk who argued a number of cases before the nationâ€ ™ s highest court as solicitor general of Texas , Cruz treats rhetoric like a master tailor : everything is precise and deliberate , measured twice and cut once .
In Thursdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate , he delivered a neat closing statement at Trumpâ€ ™ s expense : â€œWhat an incredible nation we have that the son of a bartender [ Marco Rubio ] , and the son of a mailman [ John Kasich ] , and the son of a dishwasher [ Cruz ] and a successful businessman can all stand on this stage competing and asking for your support.â€ �
He received a further boost as a number of party figures have consolidated behind him in the belief that he is the GOPâ€ ™ s best chance to stop Trump .
In the past week , Neil Bush , a brother and son of former presidents , endorsed him , as did former rival Carly Fiorina .
Further , Utahâ€ ™ s Mike Lee became the first senator to endorse him .
â€œItâ€ ™ s time for the party to unite behind Ted Cruz , â€ �
Lee told CNN on Friday .
â€œI think heâ€ ™ s the only candidate who is not Donald Trump who can get the nomination at this
point.â€ �
Cruz is currently the only candidate besides Trump who has a mathematical possibility of obtaining a majority of delegates on the first ballot at Julyâ€ ™ s Republican convention .
But the odds are against him , as many of Cruzâ€ ™ s best states , like his home of Texas have already cast their ballots .
If no one gets the necessary 1,237 delegates , the nomination will go to a contested convention in July , where Cruz would perhaps have the strongest delegate operation of any Republican campaign .
Democrats are watching the contest closely , unsure whether Cruz , the devil they know , would be better to face than Trump , a wild card who could scramble the normal dynamics of blue and red states .
â€œMany Democrats would rather face Cruz than Trump in November because he seems easier to beat , â€ � said Blake Zeff , a veteran Democratic strategist and now editor - in - chief of the media network Cafe .
â€œRepublicans have had huge problems winning national elections the last few decades , and a far - right candidate lacking personal appeal does not seem like the way to fix that problem , â€ �
Zeff continued .
â€œTrump , on the other hand , is a bit more unpredictable , because of his propensity to say anything , ability to withstand political damage , â€ � â€
“ Zeff alluded to the billionaireâ€ ™ s spat with the pope â€ “ his â€œappeal to atypical Republican constituencies , and willingness to tailor his political positions to any given moment .
Cruz , in contrast to Trumpâ€ ™ s improvisational campaign , has built a formidable political operation modeled on Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s campaign in 2008 , and would provide his own set of challenges for Hillary Clinton in November ."
2016-03-13,"Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s
reportedly impending visit to the United Kingdom will make the countryâ€ ™ s exit from the European Union more likely , Ted Cruz told reporters on Sunday .
â€œPresident Obama , if anything his campaigning against [ Britain leaving ] will make it more likely that England will pull out of the EU , â€ � said the Texas senator and Republican presidential candidate , who was campaigning in North Carolina ahead of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primary .
The Independent on Sunday reported this weekend that Obama will travel to the UK in April , as part of a trip already including Germany , to lend his support to the campaign against the so - called â€œBrexitâ€ � .
The British prime minister , David Cameron , wants Britain to stay in the European Union .
The referendum on the question will take place on 23 June .
The question of an intervention by Obama has been raised before : in February , Tennessee senator Bob Corker , the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , suggested Obama would â€œreach outâ€ � to British voters .
Declining to say if he thought the UK leaving the EU would harm US national security , Cruz pegged his argument on a critique of US foreign policy that he gives when out on the stump .
He argued that Obama had hurt â€œour alliancesâ€ � and â€œharmed our friendshipsâ€ � around the world , and that â€œour enemies have learned this president is not a credible threat for anythingâ€ � .
The Texas senator also insisted that if elected he would return a bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office .
George W Bush kept the bust , a loan from the UK , during his time in the White House .
Obama did not retain it .
Many on the American right have long viewed British EU membership with skepticism .
Anti - EU politicians like Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan have spoken at conservative conferences in the US .
On a presidential debate stage in January , Mike Huckabee said : â€œThe European Union is failure.â€ �
However , in the foreign policy community there is a strong consensus that UK membership benefits the US national interest .
Cruz made the comments before five crucial presidential primaries on Tuesday .
He is the closest competitor to Donald Trump in the Republican field and was campaigning in a state where he claimed his organisationâ€ ™ s polls showed a far closer race than public polling .
Cruz has won 370 of the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination , leaving him 90 behind Trump ."
2016-03-13,"Donald Trump has suffered a comprehensive defeat by Marco Rubio in Washington DC , where the divisive billionaire hopes to occupy the White House from January next year .
Rubio won Saturdayâ€ ™ s Republican presidential primary in the District of Columbia , edging out John Kasich and comfortably beating national frontrunners Trump and Ted Cruz .
The Florida senator took 37.3 % of the vote , giving him 10 delegates , while former Ohio governor Kasichâ€ ™ s 35.5 % earned him nine delegates .
Trump and Cruz left empty handed , as had been widely expected in the US capital , which is home to some former administration officials and has traditionally favoured establishment candidates .
But conservatives in the city that hosts the White House , Congress and the Lincoln Memorial are used to not having much of a say in who becomes president .
There are a mere 27,000 registered Republicans here , just 6 % of all voters .
No candidates campaigned in DC before Saturdayâ€ ™ s vote ; indeed , Trump and Cruzâ€ ™ s anti - establishment speeches often make Washington sound like a dirty word .
Although its influence was higher than normal this time
â€ “ there were 19 delegates at stake , as many as Hawaii and more than Vermont or Delaware â€ “ turnout was still a relatively low 2,839 , less than half the number who voted four years ago .
This may in part have been because voting was restricted to a single location , the downtown Loews Madison Hotel , on what proved a grey and drizzly day .
A glimpse of the queue snaking around several blocks , including determined parents holding babies and pushing strollers , may also have put some people off .
Colleen McKiernan , 29 , a healthcare consultant , arrived just before the cut off time of 4 pm .
â€œThis is ridiculous , â€ �
she said .
â€œWe were told it would take a couple of minutes to vote but
itâ€ ™ s six blocks long .
Iâ€ ™ m going to leave and itâ€ ™ s frustrating because I really wanted to vote.â€
�
But others stuck it out .
Ben Voelkel , 29 , a senatorial press secretary , waited more than three and a half hours to cast his ballot .
â€œIt was the longest line Iâ€ ™ ve ever had to wait in for anything , â€ � he said .
â€œAt first
I thought it might be a protest , then I said to someone there ,
Iâ€ ™ m impressed how many of us there are .
I didnâ€ ™ t think there are that many Republicans in DC .
It was exciting to see them all engaged in the process.â€ �
Voting was slow not only due to the presidential race but because 160 candidates , said to be a record in modern times , were running for election as delegates at the Republican convention in Cleveland , Ohio , in July .
Among those who were unsuccessful was Alyssa Abbinanti , 42 , a lawyer and Cruz supporter .
A Korean - American , she called for more diversity in the party , noting a sea of white male faces on the list of candidates .
â€œIâ€ ™ m in a minority on multiple levels , â€ � she said .
â€œI wish people would look at what we really stand for.â€
�
Washington is a Democratic stronghold that voted for Barack Obama in overwhelming numbers four years ago .
Dan Hemmati , 36 , a Rubio supporter , was accompanied on Saturday by his wife of three months , Amy , 35 , who is a Democrat .
â€œWe do have debates but theyâ€ ™ re always friendly , â€ � he said .
â€œRepublicans are a minority here but we find ways of making it work and keeping our mouths shut when we have to.â€ �
Hemmati was among many determined to vote against the maverick Trump , who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the US and a wall to be built on the Mexican border .
â€œThis is one of the most important elections in a long time .
Itâ€ ™ s a chance to show what the Republican party is all about .
Itâ€ ™ s not an exclusionist party of hate ; itâ€ ™ s the party of Lincoln and Reagan .
Donald Trump is not a Republican and not a Democrat .
Heâ€ ™ s just a hateful son of a bitch .
Heâ€ ™ s not a politician ; heâ€ ™ s a reality show actor trying to get publicity for his next show.â€
�
The buzz and bustle in the hotel corridors and stairways made a change for Patrick Mara , executive director of the DC Republican party , who is used to being the only Republican in the room .
â€œItâ€ ™ s pretty lonely , â€ � he smiled .
â€œEven
my wife is a Democrat.â€ � The DC presidential primary convention had been brought forward to avoid being too close to the national convention , giving it more influence in the race than usual .
Kasich , Rubio and â€œNeverTrumpâ€ � were most in evidence on badges , flyers , placards and stickers .
â€œItâ€ ™ s fantastic to see all these people come out to vote .
Your average DC Republican is well read in current events and world affairs .
We see so many people turn out because they know this is meaningful .
What they do today is not only local news but national and world news , â€ � Mara said ."
2016-03-15,"Ted Cruz said that Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign manager , who is accused of assaulting a reporter , committed â€œa fireable offenseâ€ � .
Corey Lewandowski allegedly forcibly grabbed Michelle Fields , then a reporter for Breitbart News , at a Trump event last week and pushed her towards the ground , leaving bruises .
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday , Cruz described the Trump campaign as reaching a new â€œheight of disdain from a candidate for reporters and votersâ€ � .
He contrasted the â€œallegations of significant assaultâ€ � to a controversy last year over Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign roping off reporters in a Fourth of July parade in New Hampshire .
He noted : â€œWhat a bizarre world we are in where reporters are forced to ask the question : should political campaign staffers physically assault reporters?â€ �
Cruz added , â€œAt the end of the day , the responsibility for any campaign rests with the candidate.â€ �
Although Lewandowski initially admitted fault to Fieldsâ€ ™ s editor , and the incident last week in Florida was witnessed by a Washington Post reporter and captured on audio and video , he has since accused the conservative reporter of fabricating the incident .
Fields has since pressed criminal charges against the top Trump operative .
Fields has since resigned after the Breitbart website , long pro - Trump , tried to deny the incident occurred .
At least other three staffers at the website have joined her with one comparing Breitbart to â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s personal Pravdaâ€ � .
The alleged assault is one of many cases of physical violence connected with the Trump campaign .
In the past week , a protester at a Trump rally was sucker - punched by an attendee , and a Trump event in Chicago descended into chaos and violence after the Republican frontrunner canceled the event .
A Trump supporter even went so far as to interrupt a Cruz event earlier on Monday in Peoria , shouting â€œgo back to Canadaâ€ � and waving a Trump sign .
Cruz responded to his shouts by saying , â€œOne difference between this and a Donald Trump rally is Iâ€ ™ m not asking anyone to punch you in the faceâ€ � as security eventually appeared to lead the protester away .
It probably marked the first time a supporter of Donald Trump showed up to protest at a Cruz rally .
The Texas senator has insisted that Trump bore responsibility for incidents at the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s rally in the past .
On Friday , after the Chicago rally , Cruz said that â€œa campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment .
The predictable consequence of [ Trumpâ€ ™ s comments ] is it escalates .
Today is unlikely to be the last such instance.â€ �
Cruz himself fired a top staffer , Rick Tyler , several weeks ago after he tweeted a false story alleging Marco Rubio â€œsaid something negative about the Bibleâ€ � .
Tyler quickly apologized when he realized that the story he tweeted was wrong .
The audio of Rubio was fuzzy , leading some to assume the Florida senator said : â€œGot a good book there , not many answers in it.â€ �
In fact , Rubio remarked â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
The Texas senator said : â€œThis was a grave error of judgment .
It turned out the news story he sent around was false .
But Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , even if it was true , we are not a campaign that will question the faith of another candidate.â€ �
Cruz is currently in second place to Trump in the heated Republican primary .
Trump has 460 of the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination while Cruz currently has accumulated 370 ."
2016-03-15,"On 15 March , the names of the remaining presidential candidates â€ “ Donald Trump , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and John Kasich on the Republican side , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats â€ “ will be on ballot papers in five states and one US territory .
Although this Tuesday will be less frantic than Super Tuesday two weeks ago , when 12 states and one territory held primary elections , itâ€ ™ s just as important .
By 16 March , the race for the White House could look very different depending on how Florida , Illinois , Missouri , North Carolina and Ohio vote .
Thatâ€ ™ s partly because the delegate numbers in those states are so high â€ “ in total , 367 Republican and 792 Democratic delegates are available on 15 March .
That brings us significantly closer to the finish line of having just two presidential candidates : at the moment , 33 % of Democratic delegates have been pledged but by the time the polls have closed on 15 March , that number will rise to 50 % .
For Republicans , pledged delegates will jump from 46 % to 61 % .
Those percentages just mean that playing catch - up gets harder from here .
Clinton is still on track for the Democratic nomination â€ “ to change that , Sanders needs to pick up at least 326 of the pledged delegates ( in the Democratic race there are also 712 â€œsuperdelegatesâ€ � who are not pledged to a specific candidate based on primary results , so theyâ€ ™ re less relevant here ) .
The Republican contest is also likely to change significantly .
If , for example , Marco Rubio fails again to pick up a single delegate ( and polling suggests thatâ€ ™ s a real possibility ) , his pursuit of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination becomes futile â€ “ even if he were to win every single remaining delegate after 15 March .
Thatâ€ ™ s partly because , unlike Democrats , Republicans do not always distribute delegates in proportion to votes .
In fact , four states holding Republican primaries on 15 March will be the first in this election to assign delegates on a winner - takes - all basis , which is why this date is such a turning point in the 2016 political calendar .
Florida Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 99 Republican delegates , 246 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for : For Republicans , this is the most important state to vote on 15 March .
If Rubio were going to win big anywhere , it probably would be here , in his home state .
However , polling averages show that Trump has consistently been in first place for voters since September and is leading by 19 points in this winner - takes - all state .
Clinton , too , has had a clear lead in Florida for months â€ “ so far this month , polls have suggested she is 30 points ahead of Sanders .
Remember though , unlike the Republican race , the exact vote share matters for Democrats since this affects how delegates are distributed .
Sanders doesnâ€ ™ t need to win Florida , he needs only to erode Clintonâ€ ™ s lead here and collect around 100 of the pledged delegates that are available .
Demographics : Of the 15.9 million Floridians who are of voting age , 12 million are currently registered to vote .
The electorate is slightly older and more likely to be Hispanic than the national voting profile .
A poll from Monmouth earlier this month found that 35 % of Republicans donâ€ ™ t approve of the way that Rubio is handling his job as senator and just 7 % were undecided about who they would vote for .
Illinois Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 69 Republican delegates , 182 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for :
Illinois is a crucial state in the Democratic race .
Polling averages currently show that Clinton is ahead of Sanders by just 2 percentage points .
But thereâ€ ™ s a significant margin of error on those numbers , given that theyâ€ ™ re based on just three polls prior to which Clinton was easily leading in the double digits .
If polling turns out to be as flawed here as it was in Michigan last week , Sandersâ€ ™ climb to the White House might not be so uphill after all .
Thereâ€ ™ s also a lack of good polling data among Republicans that live here
â€ “ only six polls have been conducted here so far this year , but all show Trump with a small but steady lead on other candidates .
Demographics :
The profile of Illinoisâ€ ™ electorate is almost identical to the US national average .
And voter concerns are similar to those expressed nationally too â€ “ a CBS / You Gov poll of 1,681 registered voters in Illinois that was conducted from 9 - 11 March found that 74 % of respondents felt the economy in their state was doing badly .
Half of Republican voters in the poll said they felt that trade with other countries takes away US jobs
â€ “ a message that has been a key part of Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign .
Missouri Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 52 Republican delegates , 84 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for : Although Missouri is holding Republican and Democratic primaries , the results of the Republican vote will not be binding â€ “ as was also the case in 2012 , when Rick Santorum won here .
Last September , the Missouri Republican state committee announced the rules governing this yearâ€ ™ s Republican primary : if a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes ( anything more than 50 % ) , Missouri will be a winner - take - all state ; if not , the candidate with the highest vote share in each congressional district would get five delegates , and the leading candidate statewide would be awarded nine delegates .
The remaining three delegates would be unbound , much like Democratic superdelegates .
In terms of outcomes , predicting the results in Missouri is pretty much guesswork .
Just two Democratic polls have been conducted there this year , and only one poll has asked Republican voters who they prefer â€ “ those surveys have suggested Sanders and Clinton are neck - and - neck while Trump is ahead of the Republican field .
But they simply arenâ€ ™ t a reliable indication of voter preferences in Missouri .
Demographics :
The electorate in Missouri is whiter with a slightly lower median household income than national averages .
Officials currently expect around 34 % of registered voters to show up and cast a ballot in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primary â€ “ although this varies considerably throughout the state , from a projected low of 7 % turnout in Washington County to a high of 74 % in Caldwell County .
North Carolina Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 72 Republican delegates , 121 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for : Polls currently show Clinton leading steadily here and , to a lesser extent , Trump too .
Again , vote shares matter , including for Republicans â€ “
this is the only state where thereâ€ ™ s no minimum threshold to get delegates .
The GOP simply assigns them in proportion to votes received at the primary .
Results in North Carolina could be surprising â€ “ Trumpâ€
™ s lead here has varied in recent polls from just 9 points to as much as 20 .
Demographics : One in five voting - age residents of North Carolina are black ( nationally that figure is one in eight ) .
That might work against Sanders , who has struggled to appeal to black voters according to some exit polls .
Voter turnout was 35 % in 2012 and and 37 % in 2008 .
So far , Republicans have seen growth in primary turnout while the opposite is true for Democrats .
( There have been some exceptions â€ “ in Michigan , where Sanders won big last week , almost twice as many voters showed up as in 2008 . )
High turnout may work in Sandersâ€ ™ favour on 15 March .
Northern Mariana Islands Primaries : Republican caucus Delegates : 9 Republican delegates Things to watch out for :
The Northern Mariana Islands are a US commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean .
On Saturday , the first ever Democratic caucuses were held there .
Clinton received a total of 102 votes , Sanders received 65 and an additional 22 votes were cast for â€œuncommittedâ€ � .
As a result , Clinton collected an extra four delegates and Sanders two â€ “ on 15 March , nine Republican delegates will be chosen by Northern Mariana Islanders .
Demographics :
The islands have a population of 53,883 , according to the Census Bureau in 2010 .
No polling is available about the residentsâ€ ™ political preferences .
Ohio Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 66 Republican delegates , 159 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for
: This is the only state to vote on 15 March where Trump is not polling ahead of other candidates â€ “ John Kasich , who is the governor of Ohio , is 3 points ahead of him .
That might not sound like much , but Ohio is a winner - takes - all state with 66 GOP delegates available .
A win for Kasich wouldnâ€ ™ t give him any real chance of securing the nomination , but for Republicans , the strategy at this point may be simply about trying to erode Trumpâ€ ™ s delegate numbers as much as possible ( at least according to Rubio adviser Alex Conant ) .
If Kasich loses , he will almost certainly drop out of the race .
Clintonâ€ ™ s lead here has eroded in recent weeks from double digits to an average lead of 8 percentage points .
This is yet another state where Sanders might surpass expectations â€ “ particularly given the stateâ€ ™ s demographics .
Demographics :
Ohioâ€ ™ s electorate is whiter and has a slightly lower median household income than the US median ( $ 49,000 compared to $ 54,000 ) .
A poll from Quinnipiac University earlier this month found that gender could play a big role in Ohioâ€ ™ s primary for both parties .
The results showed that men back Trump over Kasich 40%-33 % while women choose Kasich 44%-37 % .
Among Democrats , the gaps were even larger with women backing Clinton over Sanders 56%-39 % and men choosing Sanders 55%-43 % .
As ever , itâ€ ™ s not just overall turnout numbers that matter , but more specifically which voters show up ."
2016-03-16,"March comes in like a lion and out like a lamb - and so , too , did todayâ€ ™ s political news .
Beginning with the aftermath analysis of 2 Super 2 Tuesday , fallout from the suspension of Florida senator Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s presidential campaign and Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the current vacancy on the supreme court , Wednesday started as a banner day in this tempestuous campaign season .
Now that things have settled down a bit , letâ€ ™ s look back at some of the biggest political news of the day : Barack Obama nominated DC circuit judge Merrick Garland to the US supreme court , sketching the biography of a man who graduated first in his class at Harvard and paid his way through law school by selling his comic books .
( To pay for college that way nowadays , youâ€ ™ d better own a near - mint edition of Action Comics # 1 . )
Obama called on senate Republicans to â€œjust be fairâ€ � in considering the nomination , which leadership in Congress from Mitch McConnell on down has vowed to ignore until a new president is sworn in .
If no candidate is elected in the first round of voting at the national convention in July , presumably after having crossed the 1,237 delegate barrier , former speaker of the house John Boehner said heâ€ ™ s planning on supporting current speaker Paul Ryan for the Republican nomination : â€œThey all had a chance to win .
None of them won .
So Iâ€ ™ m for none of the above .
Iâ€ ™ m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.â€ � Ryan , for his part , is not having it .
After Donald Trump declared that he would not be participating in the scheduled 21 March debate in Salt Lake City , a recent add to the debate calendar , Fox News cancelled the debate entirely .
Trump will instead be speaking to AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
â€œIâ€ ™ m doing a major speech in front of a very important group of people that night , â€ � Trump said .
Florida governor Rick Scott endorsed Trump for president , a day after Trump beat home - state senator Marco Rubio by 19 points .
â€œWith his victories yesterday , I believe it is now time for Republicans to accept and respect the will of the voters and coalesce behind Donald Trump , â€ � a Scott statement says .
â€œThe voters are speaking clearly
â€ “ they want a businessman outsider who will dramatically shake up the status quo in Washington.â€

Pundits arenâ€ ™ t the only ones foreseeing chaos in Cleveland this summer at the Republican national convention - the candidates are too .
Trump , asked in a telephone interview with CNN this morning about the possibility of a brokered national Republican convention if no one candidate hits 1,237 delegates , declared that if such an event arises , there will be rioting in the street .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re 20 votes short or if weâ€ ™ re you know 100 votes , and weâ€ ™ re at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400 , cause weâ€ ™ re way ahead
â€
“
I donâ€
™ t think you can say we donâ€ ™ t get it automatically , I think youâ€ ™ d have riots , â€ �
Trump said .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for today in politics - check in again tomorrow , the day after that and every day from now until election day for minute - by - minute coverage of democracy in action .
The fourth season of House of Cards is still fun , but the grim , satisfying resonance with the present is gone in the age of Donald Trump .
Did the showâ€ ™ s cynical view of politics contribute to making its own commentary obsolete ?
Netflixâ€ ™ s
House of Cards made its name by shocking and thrilling viewers with its political chiaroscuro and seductive cynicism .
The showâ€ ™ s gorgeous cinematography emphasized Washingtonâ€ ™ s clean lines and sharp edges .
The only dirtiness was Frank Underwoodâ€ ™ s , and his filth was philosophical .
Heâ€ ™ s a pseudo - Shakespearean devil , a cunning exploiter of defects .
The only character more compelling than Frank is his wife
â€
“ Robin Wrightâ€ ™
s magnificent turn as Claire Underwood exposed the metastasizing ambitions of a political partnership , and her riveting trajectory resonated with real events .
Through Claire , the show implicitly theorized the bitter and intoxicating vertigo of being â€ “ and becoming â€ “ Hillary Clinton , the brilliant ally and eventual political equal of a sweet - talkinâ€ ™ , power - hungry southern man .
Thatâ€ ™ s all to say that House of Cards was fun and dark , but also â€ “
and this is the key term
â€ “
it was relevant .
It no longer is .
So far , the road to the 2016 presidential election has been more like a terrifying parade of insults , fights and even featured the occasional white supremacist .
Itâ€ ™ s been an unpredictable campaign season ; Donald Trump is looking increasingly more likely to be the Republican nominee , establishment candidates like Jeb Bush dropped out early and despite her best efforts , Hillary Clinton still hasnâ€ ™ t locked in her place on the ballot .
Itâ€ ™ s no surprise weâ€ ™ re gripped with election anxiety .
Maybe youâ€ ™ re fearful of a president who flip - flops or one whoâ€ ™ ll take away your healthcare .
Maybe youâ€ ™ re passionate about Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ political revolution and worried it wonâ€ ™ t happen .
Perhaps you had been gripped by # Rubiomentum only to see his strong head of hair bow out last night .
There are still seven and a half months to go .
We asked a psychoanalyst , a cultural theorist and a meditation expert for their tips on how to navigate your election anxiety ( things we havenâ€ ™ t included but go without saying : go for a walk , cuddle a baby , sip some whiskey ) .
An editorial written under Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s name appears to have heavily plagiarized a similar editorial written under the name of former presidential candidate Ben Carson , according to the Daily Caller .
Carsonâ€ ™ s editorial was published in the Marianas Variety , a newspaper in the Northern Mariana Islands , on February 26 .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
editorial was published in the Pacific Daily News , a newspaper in Guam , 12 days later .
Both pieces , written on the topic of territories and commonwealths of the United States , feature extensive passages that are identical word - for - word :
From Carsonâ€ ™ s piece : â€œMedical care in the American territories and commonwealths has historically lagged far behind the continental states , and Obamacare has only made the situation worse .
Good health is an essential part of a thriving society and economy , and citizens of the territories and commonwealths deserve policies that work .
More must be done to fix the broken healthcare systems.â€ �

The relationship between Trump and Carson , who endorsed the billionaire Republican frontrunner on March 11 , has been increasingly complicated following the suspension of Carsonâ€ ™ s campaign .
The retired pediatric neurosurgeon has admitted in interviews that he preferred other candidates but had been promised a position in Trumpâ€ ™ s administration in exchange for his support .
Chicago was just the beginning .
Millions of Americans are ready to form a grassroots movement against Donald Trump , activists say , determined to challenge the politics of prejudice and show there is now more at stake than the White House .
â€œThere was a deer in the headlights quality in the country at the rise of Donald Trump over the past year , â€ � said Ben Wikler , Washington director of the civil society group MoveOn.org .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s now
over.â€ �
An election campaign that has transgressed the normal boundaries of party politics demands a commensurate response in the eyes of many .
Even as the Republican party flounders and the media remains transfixed , there are signs that activists , students and ordinary citizens are ready to mobilise against Trump , whowon another series of states in the Republican primaries on Tuesday .
Wikler continued : â€œItâ€ ™ s rapidly coalescing .
The conversations are starting within movements and between movements across the country .
People are having conversations about how they can connect .
Whatâ€ ™ s clear is that there is an incredible hunger to push back against hate.â€ �
Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe has announced his support for Ohio governor John Kasichâ€ ™ s presidential campaign this evening , calling the governor â€œmy guy.â€ �
I served with John in Congress when he successfully spearheaded the effort to balance the federal budget and , as a member of the Armed Services Committee , helped President Reagan enact his national security agenda ,
â€ �
Inhofe said .
â€œDuring this time , I also attended a weekly Bible study with him for eight years .
You learn a lot about a person when you attend a Bible study together , so I can tell you personally that he is a man of his word .
When he talked , people listened .
Now the country is listening to his message of optimism and results .
Thatâ€ ™ s refreshing .
Iâ€ ™ m proud to stand by his side as we spread this message to voters in the weeks
ahead.â€ � â€œIt is an incredible honor to receive the support of my friend and former colleague , Senator Jim Inhofe , â€ � said Kasich in the release .
â€œJim is a role model to several generations of conservatives , and I trust his expertise and judgment implicitly .
He knows Oklahoma voters better than just about anyone , so itâ€ ™ s a major win to have him in our corner going forward.â€

Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s pick for the supreme court is unlikely to be approved , writes Scott Lemieux .
But the political beating heâ€ ™ ll receive will make Republicans look bad â€ “ and thatâ€ ™ s the point .
In ordinary times , you would expect a president like Barack Obama to nominate a young , liberal judge for the US supreme court .
But these arenâ€ ™ t ordinary times .
On Wednesday , Obama announced his pick : Merrick Garland .
The 63-year - old Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is older than many expected the nominee to be â€ “ and more moderate .
In other political circumstances , the choice of Garland would be unusual .
But these are not ordinary times .
The pick would be unusual in that Garland is more moderate than Obamaâ€ ™ s two previous supreme court nominees , Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor .
While not a conservative , he does have a conservative streak on some issues , most notably the civil liberties of criminal defendants .
As Obama observed more than once when announcing Garlandâ€ ™ s nomination , the judgeâ€ ™ s moderation earned him significant bipartisan support for his confirmation in the US Senate .
Had Garland been nominated in 2007 , liberal groups would be up in arms .
But itâ€ ™ s not 2007 .
Senate Republicans have made it clear that they will not hold hearings , let alone a vote , on any Obama replacement for Scalia .
Given the stakes â€ “ even if he is more moderate than Kagan or Sotomayor , Garland would still be the first Democratic nominee to be the median vote on the court since early in the Nixon administration and would move the court to the left â€ “ they have no reason to back off before the election .
Five deputies with the Cumberland County sheriffâ€ ™ s office in Fayetteville , North Carolina , have been disciplined after they witnessed an assault against an anti - Donald Trump protestor and restrained the protestor , rather than his assailant .
In a statement to local news station WRAL , Sheriff Earl Butler said that the deputies in question faced disciplinary measures for â€œunsatisfactory performance and failing to discharge the duties and policies of the office of the sheriff.â€ � â€œThe actions of the deputies and their failures to act in situations such as that which occurred during the Trump rally at the Crown Coliseum have never been and will never be tolerated under the policies of this office , â€ � Butler said .
Two deputies were suspended without pay for three days , while three more were demoted and suspended without pay for five days .
All five of the deputies were placed on a one - year probation .
At the rally on March 9 , Rakeem Jones was punched in the face by a Trump supporter â€ “ after which uniformed sheriffâ€ ™ s deputies tackled and detained Jones .
Charges have since been filed against his assailant .
Barack Obama will make an historic address to the Cuban people , calling for more freedom but stressing that the US is no longer seeking regime change on the island , according to the White House .
This first speech on Cuban soil by a US president in almost 90 years will be the highlight of a three - day trip that also includes a bilateral summit with RaÃºl Castro , a joint news conference , a private meeting with dissidents , a baseball game and a moment to pay homage to the Catholic church for helping broker talks that led to the opening of relations in September .
Obama , who will travel with his wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha , will be the first US president to visit Havana since Calvin Coolidge in 1928 .
Scandal is about to get even more dramatic - with the addition of a character inspired by Donald Trump .
During a panel on Tuesday night at PaleyFest at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles , the cast revealed the existence of the character in this weekâ€ ™ s episode , which they screened for an audience .
The character will be entering the showâ€ ™ s ongoing presidential race .
â€œThere will be a candidate who will emerge who has many qualities that Mr Trump has .
How could we resist that?â€ �
Tony Goldwyn , who plays President Fitz Grant , said during an interview with Variety .
â€œExcept
I guarantee you
thereâ€
™ s no way
he will be as outrageous as Trump is.â€ � Kerry Washington , who plays crisis manager Olivia Pope , joked : â€œYou think the debates youâ€ ™ ve seen in the real world are fun!â€ � Video : Michelle Obama says that thereâ€ ™ s no way sheâ€ ™ d run for president With its eyes on the upcoming winner - take - all Republican primary in Arizona , the campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz has announced a high - profile endorsement in the Grand Canyon State : Congressman David Schweikert , a Tea Party darling who represents parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale .
â€œMy top priority in Congress has always been to do what the Washington insiders simply refuse to do , and that is to reduce the size and cost of government and save our nation from the crushing debt that the Washington politicians have placed on the backs of each and every citizen of our nation , â€ � Schweikert said in a statement released by the campaign .
â€œThroughout the never ending battles to do this , Ted Cruz has always been a principled leader fighting to do the very same thing ,
â€ � Schweikert said .
â€œWith a federal debt that is quickly approaching an unfathomable $ 20 trillion , our countryâ€ ™ s future economic growth and prosperity are in grave danger unless we elect a principled conservative who is truly committed to stopping the out of control spending and borrowing that has led us to where we are today.â€ � â€œItâ€ ™ s clear that Ted is the conservative leader that we need as our next president , and my wife Joyce and I are proud to give him our strongest endorsement .
In the upcoming Arizona presidential preference primary , Ted is the clear choice for voters who want a conservative president who is truly committed to fixing the mess in Washington , â€ � Schweikert concluded .
â€œI am thrilled to have such a passionate fighter for liberty on our team , â€ �
Cruz said in the same statement .
â€œDavid has spent his time in Congress fighting against the Washington Cartel and protecting the interests of the American people .
He has worked to rein in Obamaâ€ ™ s lawlessness , repeal Obamacare , and stop the Presidentâ€ ™ s illegal executive amnesty .
David is a strong addition to our team and I am thankful for his leadership fighting on issues that are most important to conservatives.â€ � Donald Trump , whose strong rhetoric on immigration will likely strike a cord in the border state , has won the endorsements of Jan Brewer , the popular former governor who bore the brunt of nationwide criticism after she signed a controversial bill requiring immigrants to carry documents proving their legal status , as well as that of Joe Arpaio , â€œAmericaâ€ ™ s
Toughest Sheriff , â€ � whose stances on undocumented immigrants have made him a celebrity in the state .
Billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson may be softening towards Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s contentious run for president .
Video obtained by Israeli political blogger Tal Schneider reportedly shows Adelson at a gala event in Las Vegas on 27 February stating :
â€œTrump is a businessman .
I am a businessman .
He employs a lot of people .
I employed 50,000 people .
Why not?â€ �
Although far from a gushing endorsement , the remarks suggest that Adelson , a Republican superdonor , may decline to fund a # NeverTrump movement to stop the GOP frontrunner from becoming the partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
Some establishment Republicans had held out hope that he would .
â€œIt reminds me of [ a joke],â€ �
Adelson said at the event , according to an article inthe Jewish Journal , which translated the quotes that Schneider posted in Hebrew .
â€œOne
Jewish man said to another Jewish man , â€˜Do you know why Jews always answer a question with a question?â€ ™
So the guy said , â€˜Why not?â€ ™ â€ �
Then he reportedly joked : â€œIf I were running I would have endorsed myself.â€

The election of Donald Trump to the presidency poses an existential risk to the global economy and the security of the United States , according to the Economist Intelligence Unit .
â€œIn the event of a Trump victory , his hostile attitude to free trade , and alienation of Mexico and China in particular , could escalate rapidly into a trade war - and at the least scupper the Trans - Pacific Partnership between the US and 11 other American and Asian states signed in February 2016,â€ � the respected economic analytical and risk - management firm declared in its list of top-10 global risks .
â€œHis militaristic tendencies towards the Middle East ( and ban on all Muslim travel to the US ) would be a potent recruitment tool for jihadi groups , increasing their threat both within the region and beyond.â€ �
Alongside a sharp economic downturn in China and the breakup of the eurozone , Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy is described as a â€œhigh - impactâ€ � risk to global security .
In particular , his â€œexceptionalâ€ � hostility to free trade and â€œexceptionally right - wing stance on the Middle East and jiadhi terrorism , including , among other things , advocating the killing of families of terrorists and launching a land incursion into Syriaâ€ � are seen as having the potential to destabilize global markets and encourage Islamist terrorism .
Obamaâ€ ™ s nominee for the empty ninth seat on the US supreme court now finds himself in the middle of one of the most intense political and constitutional spats of modern times , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ed Pilkington .
He is being fought over like a woollen toy torn between the teeth of Rottweilers â€ “ the president seeking to secure his legacy and the Republican majority in the US Senate seeking to preserve the conservative domination of Americaâ€ ™ s highest court .
The US 2016 election cycle is proving to be a stressful time for citizens across the states .
The Guardian sat down with a psychoanalyst , a meditation instructor , a cultural theorist and a massage therapist to find some respite from the vitriol and uncertainty that continues to plague the election cycle .
Retired pediatric neurosurgeon and onetime presidential candidate Ben Carson told Yahoo News today that billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to compare him to a child molester was part of the â€œpolitics of personal destruction , â€ � - but a canny move nonetheless .
â€œIf someone like Mr. Trump can call you , an acclaimed and noted neurosurgeon , someone who lacks intellect or is a child molester , doesnâ€ ™ t that alarm as you as to how he can portray other people in this country as well?â€ � asked anchor Bianna Golodryga .
â€œWell , he said it was political , â€ �
Carson responded .
â€œHe was concerned about the fact that he couldnâ€ ™ t shake me .
I understand politics , and particularly the politics of personal destruction , and you have to admit to some degree that it did work .
A lot of people believed him ...
unfortunately , we live in a society where that kind of thing works.â€
�
Carson has endorsed Trumpâ€ ™ s bid for the Republican presidential nomination , in part because Trump has promised him a position in a potential administration .
Michelle Obama spoke about finding the courage to overcome doubters on the South Side of Chicago , her love of Stevie Wonder and why she wonâ€
™ t run for president , during an engaging and wide - ranging Q&amp;A session at SXSW .
The biggest cheer from the crowd , who had to wait three hours and go through airport - style security checks , came when Latifah asked if Michelle Obama would ever consider a presidential run .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to continue to work with young people all over the world , â€ �
she said before pausing .
â€œNot as president .
I will not run for president.â€ �
After a chorus of playful jeers from the crowd she explained that one of the reasons was that so her children â€ “ Malia and Sasha â€ “ would no longer be in the spotlight .
â€œNo , no not going to do it .
One of the reasons why is that Iâ€ ™ ve got these two young people at home .
Being the kids , the daughters of a president , just think about it .
Come on young people , not so easy .
Theyâ€ ™ ve handled it with grace and with poise , but there are so many ways to impact the world and you donâ€ ™ t have to be president of the United States to do them.â€ �
She said she was planning to continue her advocacy work , with a special focus on working with young people , after her time at the White House and that she wanted a new generation of engaged young people to get into politics .
â€œI
just know that if I can do this and be here and have gone to great colleges and have all these wonderful experiences , you can do it too ,
â€ � she said .
â€œExperiencing this journey with our young people of all ages , Iâ€ ™ ll miss that , but Iâ€ ™ m going to keep doing it for the rest of my life.â€ �
Ted Cruz responds to the Garland nomination : Merrick Garland is exactly the type of Supreme Court nominee you get when you make deals in Washington D.C.
A so - called â€˜moderateâ€ ™ Democrat nominee is precisely the kind of deal that Donald Trump has told us he would make â€ “ someone who would rule along with other liberals on the bench like Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor . ...
I proudly stand with my Republican colleagues in our shared belief
â€ “ our advice and consent
â€ “ that we should not vote on any nominee until the next president is sworn into office .
The People will decide .
The Bernie Sanders camp says in a fundraising email that Clinton has hit â€œthe high water markâ€
� and Sanders will win a string of upcoming states .
The demographics bear him out on the â€œupcoming statesâ€ � part , with favorable conditions for Sanders in seven of the next eight states , according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis ... followed by gentle winds for Clinton in six of the last seven .
Of note : Sanders does not appear to have a path to overtake Clinton in the delegates race , barring an earthquake twist .
From the Sanders fundraising statement : What you will not hear from the political and media establishment is that , based on the primary and caucus schedule for the rest of the race , this is the high water mark for the Clinton campaign .
Starting today , the map now shifts dramatically in our favor .
[ ... ] That means we have an extremely good chance to win nearly every state that votes in the next month .
If we continue to stand together , weâ€ ™ re just getting started for our political revolution .

There used to be enough Republicans in the presidential race that one or two could rotate out of the debate schedule and youâ€ ™ d barely even notice .
That was then .
With both Trump and Kasich saying they would not attend a debate penciled in for this coming Monday in Salt Lake City , the debate has been canceled , AP reports : Karen Boe , a spokeswoman for the Salt Palace Convention Center , said they were informed Wednesday morning that the event was being scrapped .
Cruz taunts Trump as â€œducking Donaldâ€ � : Not only did Hillary Clinton outrun Bernie Sanders last night
â€
“
she outran her 2008 performances in , it appears , all five states to vote .
Not all precincts have reported in Illinois , but Clinton , who won the state , clearly did much better , mutatis mutandis , than in 2008 , when she was running against home - state senator Barack Obama .
Missouri is still too close to call , but again Clinton appears to be out - performing her previous primary run there , in terms of her share of what was admittedly a much different race .
Here are the 2008 - 2016 comparisons for Ohio and Florida : John Kasich aide John Weaver says the Ohio governorâ€ ™ s campaign will not be appearing at an event recently announced for next week unless Trump reverses his back - out .

( In a race where margins matter , she won Ohio by a similar margin and Florida by blink - blink 31 points .

It was a much better showing for Clinton than in the 2008 Democratic primary , which she lost to Barack Obama :
Trump was asked in a telephone interview with CNN this morning about the possibility of a brokered national Republican convention if no one candidate hits 1,237 delegates .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re 20 votes short or if weâ€ ™ re you know 100 votes , and weâ€ ™ re at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400 , cause weâ€ ™ re way ahead

If you disenfranchise those people , I think you would have problems like youâ€ ™ ve never seen before .
I think bad things would happen .

Get to know Merrick Garland , in this official White House video : Obama called McConnell today to discuss the Garland nomination and the pair spoke , NBC News reports .
And apparently did not budge in their stances of total opposition on the Supreme Court nominee question .
Paul Ryan has just taken 50 % of the fun out of talk of a brokered national Republican convention by saying through a spokesperson that heâ€ ™ s not into the idea of swooping in as a last - minute presidential nominee .
â€œThe speaker is grateful for the support , but he is not interested .
He will not accept a nomination and believes our nominee should be someone who ran this year , â€ � Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said .
Now hereâ€ ™ s a profile in courage : Florida governor Rick Scott has endorsed Donald Trump for president , a day after Trump beat home - state senator Marco Rubio by 19 points .
â€œWith his victories yesterday , I believe it is now time for Republicans to accept and respect the will of the voters and coalesce behind Donald Trump , â€ � a Scott statement says .
â€œThe voters are speaking clearly
â€ “ they want a businessman outsider who will dramatically shake up the status quo in Washington.â€

Senator Pat Toomey , Republican of Pennsylvania , says he would be glad to consider the Garland nomination ... next year :
McConnell says the senate will consider the qualifications of the nominee â€œthe next president nominates , whoever that might be.â€ �
He tells the White House to â€œgive the people a voiceâ€ � â€ “ meaning wait a year for a new president .
McConnell is speaking .
Heâ€
™ s quoting Joe Biden on the senate floor in 1992 arguing against nominating supreme court justices in the thick of a presidential race .
McConnell repeatedly calls it â€œthe Biden rule.â€ � â€œInstead of spending more time to debate an issue where we canâ€ ™ t agree , â€ �
letâ€ ™ s work on things we can agree on , McConnell says .
Like jobs .
Hatch is behind McConnell in the chamber .
â€œPresident Obama and his allies may try to pretend this fight is about a person ,
â€ �
McConnell says .
â€œBut .. it remains about a principle and not a person.â€ �
McConnell accuses the White House of politicizing the process .
He says what the president has done â€œwould be unfair to any nomineeâ€ � and warns of â€œthe great costs this action could carry for our nation.â€ �
The Republican National Committee has send a fundraiser email asking people to contribute to â€œfight backâ€ � against the Garland nomination .
â€œObama wants to ram a Clinton - appointed judge , Merrick Garland , down the American peopleâ€ ™ s throats ,
â€ � the email says .
â€œBut our Party has launched the Supreme Court Task Force to fight back as the left attacks us for defending the American people.â€ � Clinton nominated Garland to the DC circuit in the mid-1990s .
He was confirmed by a senate vote of 76 - 23 .
Itâ€ ™ s official :
the White House announces a nomination sent to the Senate : Intermission .
Majority leader McConnell says he is headed to the Senate floor to deliver remarks on the Garland nomination .
Garland skims through prosecutions from gang prosecutions to the Oklahoma City case .
â€œWe promised that we could find the perpetrators , that we would bring them to justice and that we would do that in a way that would honor the Constitution.â€ � â€œTrust in justice ... is what in large part distinguishes this country from others ,
â€ �
Garland says .
He says judges must put aside personal views and preferences and â€œfollow the law , not make it.â€ � â€œIf the senate sees fit to confirm me ...
I promise to continue on that course.â€ �
He turns to the president and says he is â€œgrateful beyond
wordsâ€ � for the honor .
The trio goes back inside .
Garland is heading to the hill tomorrow for meetings with lawmakers , Obama said .
â€œThis is the greatest honor of my life other than Lynn agreeing to marry me 28 years ago , â€ � Garland says .
And the greatest gift , apart from the birth of our daughters , he says .
Heâ€ ™ s choking up .
Touching start .
He talks about his parents leaving Europe , â€œfleeing anti - Semitismâ€ � to land in Chicago .
He tells his father and motherâ€ ™ s story , his father instilling the importance of hard work and fairness , and his motherâ€ ™ s volunteer work teaching him the importance of service to the community .
He says his mother â€œis watching him on television and crying her eyes out.â€ �
He says he wishes his father could â€œsee this day.â€ �
He says his older daughter is hiking out of cell service range , and chuckles .
â€œHe is the right man for the job .
He deserves to be confirmed .
I could not be prouder of the work he has already done on behalf of the American people .
He deserves our thanks.â€ � â€ “ Obama â€œI said I would take this process seriously , and I did .
I chose a serious man and an exemplary judge , Merrick Garland ,
â€ � Obama says .
He says in all his conversations with lawmakers , â€œThe one name that has come up repeatedly from Republicans and Democrats alike is Merrick Garland.â€
�
â€œI recognize that we have entered the political season ... a political season that is even noisier and more volatile than usual .
â€œI also know because of Justice Scaliaâ€ ™ s outsized role on the court and American law ...
it is tempting to make this confirmation process simply an extension of our divided politics ...
â€œBut to go down that path would be wrong .
It would be a betrayal of our best traditions .
And a betrayal of ... our founding doctrines .
â€œThis is precisely the time when we should play it straight .
â€œThe Supreme Court is unique .
Itâ€ ™ s supposed to be above politics .
It has to be , and it should stay that way ...
â€œI simply ask Republicans in the senate to give him a fair hearing , and then an up - or - down vote .
If you donâ€ ™ t then it will not only be an abdication of the senateâ€ ™ s constitutional duty ...
it will mean everything is subject to the most partisan politics , everything.â€ � â€œThe reputation of the Supreme Court will inevitably suffer .
Faith in our justice system will inevitably suffer .
And our democracy will ultimately suffer as well .
â€œI have fulfilled my constitutional duty .
Now itâ€ ™ s time for the Senate to do theirs .
Presidents do not stop working in the final year of their terms .
Neither should the senate.â€
� Obama quotes current chief Justice John Roberts , Garlandâ€ ™ s former colleague on the DC circuit .
â€œAny time Judge Garland disagrees , you know youâ€ ™ re in a difficult area , â€ � Roberts has said .
But Garland is not just a great legal mind , Obama says .
He has â€œa dedication to protecting the basic rights of every American , â€ � including â€œeveryday Americans.â€ � â€œTo find someone who has such a long career in public service ... to find someone who just about everyone respects but likes , that is rare , â€ � Obama says .
Now Obama is quoting senior Republican senator Hatch .
â€œIn all honesty I would like to see one person come to this floor and say one reason why Merrick Garland does not deserve this position.â€
�
Hatch has since called Garland an easy consensus nominee .
Obama points out that Republicans voted to confirm Garland .
Then he was elevated to chief judge .
Heâ€
™ s spent 19 years on the DC circuit .
Obama says Garland has a â€œtrack record on building consensus as a thoughtful , fair - minded justice who follows the law.â€ � Obama sketches Garlandâ€ ™ s bio .
Born in Chicago .
Valedictorian of public high school .
Summa cum laude from Harvard and graduate of Harvard Law .
He sold his comic book collection to help pay for law school .
Yuk Yuk .
â€œStop .
Iâ€ ™ ve been there , â€ � Obama says .
He continues : Garland clerked for two Eisenhower appointees , Friendly and Brennan .
He entered private practice and rose to partner in four years .
In 1989 he â€œwalked away from a comfortable and lucrative law practice to return to public service.â€ �
He was a prosecutor in George HW Bushâ€ ™ s administration .
â€œHe quickly made a name for himself going after corrupt politicians and violent criminals.â€ �
He oversaw â€œevery aspect of the federal response to the Oklahoma City bombing.â€ � â€œMerrick had one evening to say goodbye to his young daughters before he went to Oklahoma City , where he would remain for weeks ...
he led the investigation and supervised the prosecution that brought Timothy McVeigh to justice .
Perhaps what was most important was the way he did
it.â€
�
â€œMerrick would take no chances that someone who murdered innocent Americans would go free on a technical challenge , â€ � Obama says .
He reached out to the victimsâ€ ™ families .
Garland calls it â€œthe most important thing I have ever done in my life , â€ � Obama says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s no surprise then ,
that soon after his work in Oklahoma City , â€ �
Garland was nominated to the DC Circuit court .
Obama is explaining and admiring the role of the court in US civil life .
â€œThis is nota a responsibility that I take lightly , â€ � he says .
It requires that he â€œset aside narrow politics.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve done my best to set up a rigorous comprehensive process , â€ � Obama says .
The WHite House talked with all judiciary committee members , scholars and experts .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of Americaâ€ ™ s sharpest legal minds , but someone who brings ... integrity , even - handedness and excellence.â€ � Obama calls Garland â€œuniquely
qualifiedâ€ � to join the court immediately .
â€œToday I am nominating chief Judge Merrick Brian Garland to join the Supreme Court.â€ � Applause .
Hereâ€ ™ s the president .
Vice president Joe Biden and Garland are with him .
Obama says few decisions are â€œmore consequentialâ€
� than nominating a court justice .
At least weâ€ ™ re all going into this looming nomination battle with the best of intentions :
Hereâ€ ™ s a live video feed of the Rose Garden , where the president is scheduled to speak momentarily : He has â€œa very good brain , â€ � in his assessment .
Donald Trump has made it official : heâ€ ™ s not participating in the scheduled 21 March debate in Salt Lake City , a recent add to the debate calendar .
Trump told Fox News that he would instead be speaking to AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
â€œIâ€ ™ m doing a major speech in front of a very important group of people that night , â€ � he said .
While we wait for Obama to pop up in the Rose Garden in about 15 minutes , letâ€ ™ s take a quick scan of politics news lines .
Former House speaker John Boehner has just kicked the conceptual door wide open on a brokered convention in which someone not currently running for president emerges as the Republican nominee .
That someone would be Boehnerâ€ ™ s successor , Paul Ryan , the Ohioan told the Futures Industry Association in comments first reported by Politico .
Update :
Not happening , Ryan says .
If no candidate is elected in the first round of voting at the national convention in July , presumably after having crossed the 1,237 delegate barrier , Boehner said , â€œIâ€ ™ m for Paul Ryanâ€
�
: They all had a chance to win .
None of them won .
So Iâ€ ™ m for none of the above .
Iâ€ ™ m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee .
The number seven is significant because under the current 54 - 46 makeup of the Senate , it only would take five Republican senators to vote in favor of a nominee to confirm by majority .
Not that Garland will get anywhere close to a confirmation vote , or that senators who previously voted in his favor would again do so in this political climate .
Barack Obama is expected to intensify his fight with the Republican majority in the US Senate by nominating an appeals court judge with a record of challenging the federal government to the US supreme court in the wake of the death of the conservative justice Antonin Scalia , write the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ed Pilkington and Dan Roberts :
Merrick Garland , the nominee according to a White House official , now faces an almost insurmountable task of overcoming the dogged resistance of the Republican wing of the Senate that has made clear its intention to boycott any Obama nominee to the nationâ€ ™ s highest court .
His nomination puts him at the center of one of the most bitter disputes to erupt between the White House and conservatives in Congress .
At 63 , Garland the oldest of the candidates that Obama shortlisted for the top judicial post .
His age alone is likely to embolden Republican senators in their contentious opposition to confirming anyone , as it will arm them with ammunition against him based on his long previous record .
The nominee is chief judge of the federal appeals court of Washington DC , a panel that traditionally is seen as a training ground for future supreme court justices .
He was nominated for the DC circuit by Bill Clinton in 1997 .
It may not presage well that it took the US Senate of that day â€ “ which was also Republican - controlled â€ “ 18 months to complete the confirmation process .
The eventual vote was 76 to 23 , with 32 Republicans supporting him .
Read the full piece here : The Guardian has independently confirmed that Judge Merrick Garland is president Obamaâ€ ™ s pick to fill the court vacancy .
Democratic senator Chuck Schumer , a judiciary committee member , tells Reuters that Garland is indeed the presidentâ€ ™ s pick .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an excellent choice , a bipartisan choice .
If the Republicans canâ€ ™ t support him , who could they support , â€ � said Schumer .
Tom Goldstein of ScotusBlog has written a useful primer on Garlandâ€ ™ s career and jurisprudence .
He calls Garland â€œessentially the model , neutral judgeâ€ � :
He is acknowledged by all to be brilliant .
His opinions avoid unnecessary , sweeping pronouncements ...
He has broad support on both sides of the aisle , and he has few ideologically controversial rulings .
Conservative commentators have expressed support for a potential Garland nomination ...
Judge Garland would also likely have the most immediate influence on the Court .
He is well known to the Justices and is likely the most respected by them collectively , particularly the more conservative Justices .
The fact that Judge Garland is not only extremely intelligent and respectful but exceptionally careful and quite centrist would mean that his views would have particular salience with , among others , Justices Kennedy and Alito .
Republicans from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on down have said that they will not consider an Obama nominee to fill the court vacancy .
In ten months a new president will take office .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know how many times we need to keep saying this : the judiciary committee has unanimously recommended to me that there be no hearing ,
â€ �
McConnell said last month .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve said repeatedly and Iâ€ ™ m now confident that my conference agrees that this decision ought to be made by the next president , whoever is elected.â€ �
McConnell said he saw no reason even to meet with an Obama nominee .
Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley , who would be in charge of convening any hearings on the nominee , has said he will not .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not going to drop any nominee into that election - year cauldron , â€ � he said earlier this month .
â€œIâ€
™ m certainly not going to let it happen to the good people of Iowa.â€
�
( Grassley is senator for Iowa . )
Republicans have in the past said nice things in particular , however , about Garland , who led the prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh .
Senator Orrin Hatch , the bodyâ€ ™ s senior Republican , has said that Garlandâ€ ™ s
â€œintelligence and his scholarship can not be questionedâ€ � .
President Barack Obama will announce Merrick Garland , the chief justice for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , as his nominee to replace late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia , the Associated Press and various outlets are reporting .
Weâ€ ™ re working to confirm .
Garland was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in 1997 with backing from a majority in both parties , including seven current Republican senators .
Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
President Barack Obama is about to announce , at 11 am ET , a supreme court nominee â€ “ a move sure to make major waves in the nominating races .
But it will be hard to top the crests last night , when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump exceeded expectations to rack up delegates in five states with mixed demographics in various regions , demonstrating again the national caliber of each candidacy .
In one state , Missouri , the races were too close to call on both the Democratic and Republican sides .
That didnâ€ ™ t stop both the Clinton and Trump campaigns from claiming wins .
Senator Marco Rubio suspended his campaign after losing his home state of Florida badly to Trump , who swiped all 99 of the delegates at stake .
Governor John Kasich enjoyed a home - state victory in Ohio and vowed to fight to the July convention , though he seemed out of the delegates race .
Ted Cruz failed to notch a victory but said the race was between him and Trump .
Hereâ€ ™ s a snapshot of the delegates races as they stand :
Who do you think gets the supreme court nod this morning ?
As always , thanks for reading and joining in !"
2016-03-16,"Donald Trump proffered a truce to the Republican establishment on Wednesday as party leaders faced the reality that they may soon have to get behind a reality television star as their most divisive presidential candidate in a generation .
A night of dramatic election night victories in Florida , North Carolina and Illinois , with another anticipated once the question of a recount is resolved in Missouri , left the billionaire celebrity and property developer in an increasingly unassailable position at the head of a dwindling field of candidates for the party nomination .
Only defeat by Governor John Kasich in his home state of Ohio marred an otherwise clean sweep of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s five primary states for Trump , who forced Florida senator Marco Rubio to drop out of the race entirely and prevented his main rival , conservative Texan Ted Cruz , from winning any new states .
Trump still faces an uncertain path to achieving the outright majority of delegates needed to seal his victory before the party meets at a national convention in July , though the chance that opponents could unite there to deny him the nomination if he keeps winning primary victories now looks slim .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s going to be a tremendous problemâ€ � if the Republican establishment tries to outmaneuver him at the convention , Trump told CNN in a series of morning television interviews .
â€œYouâ€ ™
d have riots.â€
�
Asked if he was now ready to make peace with the establishment , Trump said he would be happy to turn toward reconciliation but made clear there would little compromise in his bombastic campaign style .
â€œWith the party , yes , â€ � he told MSNBC .
â€œIâ€ ™ m fine with a turn .
At the same time , we donâ€ ™ t want to lose the edge.â€ �
The Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , is one of a number of senior figures to have held private talks with Trump in recent days as the party anxiously ponders the prospect of an outsider at the top of its ticket for crucial congressional races too .
But despite pressure for him to tone down his rhetoric and denounce violence at recent rallies , Trump made clear his determination to continue a highly combative approach while discussing Rubioâ€ ™ s departure .
â€œI liked him until about three weeks ago , when he started getting nasty , â€ � said Trump on Wednesday .
â€œAnd then , the problem is , I get nastier than him , and then I win , and then , you know , my numbers get hurt a little bit
because youâ€ ™ re so â€ “
youâ€ ™ re so tough that people donâ€ ™ t necessarily like it .
But you do what you have to do .
You know , we have to win.â€ �
The bombastic star of Celebrity Apprentice also refused to bow to pressure to name his foreign policy advisers amid concerns that his erratic comments on the Middle East were alarming US allies .
â€œIâ€ ™ m speaking with myself , number one , because I have a very good brain and Iâ€ ™ ve said a lot of things , â€ � he said .
â€œMy primary consultant is myself and I have â€ “ you know
, I have a good instinct for this stuff.â€ �
Not since controversial Arizona senator Barry Goldwater seized the party nomination in a conservative revolt in 1964 has the Republican party faced the prospect of such a divisive candidate .
Although Trump has shown stronger appeal among independent and first - time voters who have boosted turnout , many party strategists fear a repeat of the 1964 outcome : Goldwater lost in a landslide to Lyndon Johnson after carrying just six states in the general election .
On Tuesday night , Trumpâ€ ™ s remaining opponents sought to argue they still offered a viable alternative .
â€œI want to remind you tonight that I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land , â€ � said Kasich at his victory party .
Ohioâ€ ™ s winner - takes - all primary awards 66 delegates and , by winning those , Kasich will stay in the race and be able to play spoiler in a fierce contest between Cruz and Trump .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Jeff Roe , told reporters that Kasichâ€ ™ s presence in the race was â€œa jumpballâ€
� from his perspective .
On one hand , it meant the Ohio governor had kept Trump from earning 66 delegates in Ohio .
On the other , it meant that the anti - Trump vote in the party would continue to be divided .
With Trumpâ€ ™ s win in Florida and his loss in Ohio , the current frontrunner still needs to win 51.4 % of the available delegates to become the GOPâ€ ™ s nominee before the convention .
In this fiercely contested and still splintered field , that is a difficult task for Trump , but his continued dominance of the media coverage is likely to work in his favour .
Cruz bashed Trump as a weak candidate foisted by a pro - Clinton media on to the Republican electorate .
â€œThe mainstream media network suits want Donald Trump as the Republican nominee â€
¦
They are partisan Democrats ready for Hillary.â€
�
The Texas senator , however , was circumspect about his own treacherous path to reaching the majority of delegates needed to clinch the nomination in Cleveland , saying only : â€œWe continued to gain delegates on our march to 1,237.â€ � The Cruz campaign was optimistic that with many forthcoming primaries only allowing Republicans to vote , the Texas senator would fare better .
The campaign has already written off Arizonaâ€ ™ s winner - takes - all contest next week , where a majority of voters have already cast ballots , and instead is looking ahead to win coming races in Utah and Wisconsin .
However , Cruz is ready for a contested convention if it gets that far .
When asked if he was confident that all the pledged Cruz delegates would support the Texas senator on a second ballot , top Cruz strategist Jason Johnson said with a smile : â€œAll of them and more.â€ �
But Rubio struck a more sombre tone .
Speaking in his home town of Miami â€ “ the only part of the state the once promising senator won â€ “ he congratulated Trump on his victory in the Florida primary and acknowledged the grassroots uprising that had propelled the brash billionaire to frontrunner status .
â€œPeople are angry and people are very frustrated , â€ � Rubio said , before criticizing the political establishment as being out of touch with the American public .
â€œAmerica is in the middle of a real political storm , a real tsunami , â€ � he added .
â€œPeople are angry and we should have seen this coming.â€ �
Trump meanwhile , stuck to the central theme of his campaign : that his record in business makes him a deal - maker who can broker wins .
Pressed on who he might pick as a vice - presidential running mate , he replied on Wednesday : â€œI donâ€ ™ t like to talk about it
â€
¦ Iâ€ ™ m a closer , I like closing deals first.â€ �

2016-03-17,"With the dust finally settling after Super Tuesday : Civil War , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s hold on the race for the Republican presidential nomination is beginning to impact every element of the campaign , from his own partyâ€ ™ s preparation for the convention in July to the presumptive Democratic nomineeâ€ ™ s focus on the November general election .
That is , if she isnâ€ ™ t too busy sashaying on RuPaulâ€ ™ s Drag Race : As we count down the days until the next crucial set of primary contests , letâ€ ™ s look at the most important news from the campaign trail today :
Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Minnesota supporters on a conference call that he thinks fellow senator Ted Cruz is the â€œthe only conservative left in the race.â€ �
Rubio didnâ€
™ t go so far as to endorse Cruz on the call , but he did warn of the dangers of potentially elevating a trailing candidate to nominee in a brokered convention .
Rubioâ€ ™ s comments followed an assessment late Wednesday by Ben Carson , also a former candidate , that â€œturmoilâ€ � would attend a contested convention .
Part of the reason for Rubioâ€ ™ s gloom - and - doom mood about the Republican nomination : A new Reuters / Ipsos poll that found half of American women have a â€œvery unfavorableâ€ � view of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , up from the 40 % who felt that way in October .
â€œWomen form just over half of the U.S. population , â€ �
Reuters notes , â€œand they have turned out at higher rates than men in every election since 1996.â€ � But political opinions are malleable , as former presidential candidate Lindsey Graham showed earlier today .
The South Carolina senator , who once compared choosing between Cruz and Trump to choosing between being poisoned or shot , has picked his poison : Graham now plans to host a fundraiser for Cruz .
At least one person doesnâ€ ™ t hate Donald Trump : Onetime gubernatorial candidate and former grand wizard of the Ku Kluz Klan David Duke declared on his radio show that Trumpâ€ ™ s success could go a long way towards rehabilitating Adolf Hitlerâ€ ™ s public image .
â€œThey might be rehabilitating that fellow with the mustache back there in Germany , because I saw a commercial against Donald Trump , a really vicious commercial , comparing what Donald Trump said about preserving America and making America great again to Hitler in Germany preserving Germany and making Germany great again.â€ � Bernie Sanders said today that he will not seek a recount of results in Missouriâ€ ™ s Democratic presidential primary , conceding defeat to Hillary Clinton , for whom the election was called by the Associated Press only this afternoon .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s unlikely the results will impact at all the number of delegates the candidate gets and I would prefer to save the taxpayers of Missouri some money , â€ �
the ever - conciliatory Sanders told the Associated Press .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for this evening - check us out tomorrow , the next day , and every day after that for up - to - the - minute coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign .
Members of the Republican party leadership met privately today in the nationâ€ ™ s capital in the hopes of crafting a strategy that would bring about the end of billionaire frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s pursuit of the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination , according to the Associated Press .
Less than a week before another string of contests threatens to increase Trumpâ€ ™ s considerable delegate lead over the remaining contenders for the partyâ€ ™ s nomination , figures in the Republican establishment - which included commentator Erick Erickson and
evangelical leader Bob Fischer - hoped â€œto strategize how to defeat Donald Trump for the Republican nomination , and if he is the Republican nominee for president , to offer a true conservative candidate in the general election.â€ �
In a statement released after the conclusion of the meeting , the party leaders called for a â€œunity ticket that unites the Republican Party.â€ �
Such a ticket would likely include at least one of the Republican presidential candidates who have suspended their campaigns in the face of the Trump juggernaut .
The group declined , however , to endorse one of the remaining Republican candidates .
â€œLastly , we intend to keep our options open as to other avenues to oppose Donald Trump , â€ � the statement said , in what appeared to be a veiled reference to a possible third - party run for the White House , either through a new party or the endorsement of a preexisting political partyâ€ ™ s presidential ticket , like that of the Constitution Party .
Former first lady Laura Bush isnâ€ ™ t falling into the same trap that has ensnared so many other Republicans in recent weeks .
In an interview with USA Today , the wife of former president George W Bush was tightlipped about whether she would vote for billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , who once slammed her husband as having been unable to prevent the September 11 terrorist attacks that occurred during the first year of his presidency .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to answer ,
â€ �
Bush told USA Todayâ€ ™ s Capital Download .
â€œDonâ€
™ t ask that.â€ � Bush , who was promoting her new book ,
We Are Afghan Women : Voices of Hope , which makes the case for continued US troop presence in Afghanistan , told USA Todayâ€ ™ s Susan Page that she hasnâ€ ™ t committed to vote for any of the remaining Republican candidates .
Her brother - in - law , Jeb , dropped out of the race in February after a disappointing finish in the South Carolina primary .
â€œWe got off the sidelines for Jeb ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œHe was our candidate.â€ �
She did venture to state her opinion on proposals adjacent to Trump - namely , the proposed ban on foreign Muslims from entering the United States , now supported by roughly two - thirds of the Republican electorate .
â€œOne of the reasons we are a country is because we believed in freedom of religion , â€ �
she said .
â€œWe believed that people could be religious .
Or they could not worship , if they didnâ€ ™ t want to.â€ � â€œWe do not have any religious test in the United States , and thatâ€ ™ s what we need to remember -
we need to remember what our values are.â€

The former first lady was once a Democrat before she married into the Bush political dynasty .
Gimme a break !
Bernie Sanders said on Thursday he will not seek a recount of results in Missouriâ€ ™ s Democratic presidential primary , conceding defeat to Hillary Clinton .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s unlikely the results will impact at all the number of delegates the candidate gets and I would prefer to save the taxpayers of Missouri some money , â€ �
Sanders said in an interview with the Associated Press .
â€œWhether we win by 200 votes or lose by 500 , itâ€ ™ s not going to impact the delegate selection , â€ � the Vermont senator added .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to be evenly divided.â€ � Clinton ended Tuesday night with a narrow lead of 1,531 votes , but under state law , Sanders could have sought a recount because the margin was less than one - half of one percent .
Clinton will get an extra two delegates from Missouri for winning the statewide vote .
Michigan governor Rick Snyder , who is under pressure to resign over his response to the ongoing Flint water crisis , appeared before the House oversight committee in Congress on Thursday morning , telling members that the tragedy weighs on his mind â€œday [ and ] nightâ€ � .
Snyder has faced increasing criticism in recent weeks following revelations he was aware of the scale of the lead poisoning in the city months before he took action to address the problem .
Three bruising Congressional hearings into the Flint water crisis , possibly the gravest US public health emergency since Hurricane Katrina , have produced plenty of bluster and finger - pointing , but also troubling suggestions that Americaâ€ ™ s system of government is fundamentally broken .
A procession of elected officials , mayors , regulators and an emergency manager have appeared before the inquiry since February , to be berated over how a poverty - stricken city of 100,000 people was fed poisoned water for over a year before anyone started to heed warnings that all was not well .
An estimated 8,000 Flint children risk growing up with learning and developmental problems due to the lead that leached into their drinking supply .
Americaâ€ ™ s complex web of water regulations gave ample opportunity for those questioned to hurl blame at others .
There was no shortage of targets .
At the time Flint fatefully switched its water supply to the Flint river in April 2014 , the decision was made by a state - appointed emergency manager , a sort of financial tsar with wide - ranging powers .
But there was still a mayor , a council , a state regulator , the governor the regulator reported to and the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Everybody , yet nobody , was responsible .
It was intended , according to its creator , as a â€œwarning to Americaâ€ � , a horrifying and fantastical vision of the future in which the US â€ “ ludicrously
â€ “ had elected as its president Donald Trump .
But with the property billionaire now the favourite to gain the Republican nomination for the presidency , the episode of The Simpsons that in 2000 foresaw such a laughable outcome has begun looking unnervingly prescient .
A possible future Trump presidency , said the episodeâ€ ™ s writer Dan Greaney , â€œjust seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom .
It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insaneâ€
� .
A few months ago , Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin seemed on course to becoming best buddies .
Asked in December for his view of the Republican presidential frontrunner , the Russian president described him as â€œa colourful and talented person without any doubtâ€ � and â€œthe absolute leader of the presidential raceâ€ � .
Trump welcomed the praise , saying : â€œIt is always a great honour to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.â€ �
Any cosiness has been brought to an abrupt halt , however , after Trump lumped Putin in with Islamic State in a bizarre campaign ad featuring Hillary Clinton barking like a dog .
The video , posted on Trumpâ€ ™ s Instagram account , attempts to cast doubt over the Democratic party frontrunnerâ€ ™ s ability to deal with Putin and Americaâ€ ™ s opponents in general , showing the Russian leader throwing an opponent in a judo bout , and an Islamist militant gesturing at the camera with a gun .
â€œWhen it comes to facing our toughest opponents , the Democrats have the perfect answer ,
â€ � the video says , before cutting to footage of Clinton imitating a dog at a recent campaign event .
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had seen the clip but did not know if Putin had .
â€œOur attitude is negative , â€ � he said .
Billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump got flack this week for saying that he primarily consults with himself on foreign policy issues , â€œbecause
I have a very good brain and Iâ€ ™ ve said a lot of things.â€ �
Speaking of just who presidential candidates are consulting on international relations , fellow candidate Ted Cruz has chosen an interesting addition to his shadow cabinet of advisers : Frank Gaffney , the founder of think tank Center for Security Policy dubbed â€œone of Americaâ€ ™ s most notorious Islamophobesâ€ � by the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Gaffney , who has speculated that Barack Obama is a secret Muslim and that Saddam Hussein was the mastermind of the Oklahoma City bombing , was the orchestrator of the poll that Trump has used to justify his proposed ban on foreign Muslims from entering the United States .
That poll , which purported to show that â€œ25 % of [ American Muslims ] polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihadâ€ � and that 51 % of those polled â€œagreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah , â€ � has been widely lambasted as methodologically incorrect .
Despite the popularity of his work with the Trump campaign , Gaffney has taken on the role of Cruzâ€ ™ s top adviser on national security and foreign policy .
Well , that took â€ ™ em long enough .
When there is upheaval within Chinaâ€ ™ s own borders â€ “ riots , protests , vicious political power struggles â€ “ hardly a sniff of it will be found in the pages of the countryâ€ ™ s heavily - controlled press .
When it happens elsewhere â€ “ and particularly when it underscores the perils and pitfalls of democracy
â€ “
it becomes front - page news .
Such is the case of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump , who , for Chinaâ€ ™ s authoritarian rulers , has become the latest example of how allowing the masses a say in choosing their leaders is a bad idea .
â€œThe rise of a racist in the US political area worries the whole world , â€ � the party - controlled Global Times crowed this week ahead of of Trumpâ€ ™ s victory in the latest round of primaries .
â€œHe has even been called another Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler by some western media.â€ �
It added , darkly :
â€œMussolini and Hitler came to power through elections , a heavy lesson for western democracy.â€ �
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s speculation that a contested / brokered / open convention in Cleveland would lead to â€œriotsâ€ � in the streets of Cleveland has lead to condemnation of the billionaire frontrunnerâ€
™ s
apparent threat - with the sharpest condemnation coming from fellow Republican candidate John Kasich .
In a series of tweets , the Ohio governor excoriated the real estate tycoon for his â€œimplicit acceptance of violenceâ€ � this afternoon .
Criticism of the billionaireâ€ ™ s
apparent acceptance - even endorsement - of violence at his campaign rallies has increased after a series of high - profile incidents , including an assault on a protestor , the manhandling of a female reporter by Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign manager and the cancellation of a rally in Chicago that threatened to turn into a full - bore riot .

The bare knuckle fight over Merrick Garland could sway this election , writes Jill Abramson .
Garlandâ€ ™ s
temperate record magnifies the extremism of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz .
- and voters will be taking careful note of how the Republicans behave .
Garlandâ€ ™ s temperate record and demeanor also magnify the extremism of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz , the leaders for the GOP presidential nomination who could make their own court nominees if Garland is not confirmed by the election .
That could further scare off moderate Republicans .
No one has any idea , really , about Trumpâ€ ™ s judicial philosophy .
His statements about the Court have gyrated , praising Thomas , but calling Chief Justice John Roberts , another conservative , a â€œdisgraceâ€ � for voting to uphold President Obamaâ€ ™ s health care law .
Meanwhile , he has said that his sister , a federal appeals court judge in New Jersey , would be a â€œphenomenalâ€ � pick .
But she scares some conservatives because of a pro - abortion ruling .
Predicting the candidates Trump might choose for the Court is harder than figuring out who will be left standing on The Apprentice .
Cruz will seek someone more Scalia than Scalia .
The Texan is a strict â€œoriginalistâ€ � who believes that only the literal words of the Constitution should guide the courtâ€ ™ s decisions .
His skepticism of federal power has been compared to John Calhoun , the states rights absolutist whose pro - slavery views helped spark the Civil War .
Cruz , who , like Garland , graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School , prides himself on being a constitutional scholar and was heavily involved in George W Bushâ€ ™ s legal strategy to win the presidency in the contested election of 2000 .
His record as Texasâ€ ™ s solicitor general and his legal views as a senator put him way out on the right fringe , where he could scare voters more than Trump .
Two days after suspending his campaign for president , Marco Rubio wasted no time returning to his day job on Capitol Hill .
Rubio , while addressing reporters just before an intelligence committee hearing , was quick to put to rest any immediate speculation over his future .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to be anybodyâ€ ™ s vice president .
Iâ€ ™ m not interested in being vice president , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not running for governor of Florida .
Iâ€ ™ m going to finish out my term in the senate ...
and then Iâ€ ™ ll be a private citizen in January.â€ � Rubio , who declined to seek re - election for his senate seat while running for president , also ruled out a late entry into the Florida race to hold on to his seat .
Comments made by Rubio to his supporters earlier today on the state of the race garnered attention , after the senator reportedly said his former rival Ted Cruz was â€œthe only conservative left in the race.â€ �
Rubio downplayed their significance while speaking with reporters , adding he was not making any endorsements at this stage .
â€œClearly Tedâ€ ™ s positions on issues are conservative , but I donâ€
™ t have anything further to elaborate on , â€ � Rubio said .
He added that he likes Ohio governor John Kasich , too , but was simply stating his opinion on the remainder of the Republican field .
Rubio also held firm in his opposition to filling the supreme court vacancy left by the late justice Antonin Scalia under Barack Obama .
The senator said he didnâ€ ™ t plan to meet with Merrick Garland , the presidentâ€ ™ s nominee , and even if they spoke it wouldnâ€ ™ t change his mind .
â€œI know enough about his record to know
I wouldnâ€
™ t support him and I know enough about the position in general to say I donâ€ ™ t think we should be moving forward on a nominee in the last year of this presidentâ€ ™ s term , â€ � Rubio said .
Onetime gubernatorial candidate and former grand wizard of the Ku Kluz Klan David Duke has declared that the success of Republican billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump could go a long way towards rehabilitating Adolf Hitlerâ€ ™ s public image .
Duke , who has endorsed Trumpâ€ ™ s bid for the Republican nomination , declared on his radio show this week that â€œthey might be rehabilitating that fellow with the mustache back there in Germany , because I saw a commercial against Donald Trump , a really vicious commercial , comparing what Donald Trump said about preserving America and making America great again to Hitler in Germany preserving Germany and making Germany great again.â€

â€œThis war
thatâ€ ™ s going on against Donald Trump is really a war going on against America , itâ€ ™ s a war going on against the European - American majority , â€ � Duke said later in the program .
â€œThe media has incited hatred and violence and repression of Donald Trump and the hundreds of thousands , the millions of people who support him , and thatâ€ ™ s what happened in Chicago.â€ �
Trump has gotten heat for dragging his feet on condemning Duke and the Ku Klux Klan , telling CNN that â€œcertainly I would disavow it if I thought there was something wrong.â€ �
Trump subsequently reversed course , tweeting :
â€œAs
I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke â€
“
I disavow.â€

General Joseph Dunford , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , discussed suggestions made by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on dealing with Islamic State terrorists , while appearing before the Senate armed services committee today .
While Trump was not mentioned by name , the general said asking members of the military to â€œtarget civilian non - combatants and engage in techniques such as waterboardingâ€ � â€ “ both of which have been championed by Trump â€ “ would have â€œmany adverse effectsâ€ � , including on force morale .
Republican opposition to the nomination of a supreme court justice is crumbling now that the â€œstellarâ€ � Merrick Garland has been put forward , senate Democrats claimed on Thursday .
The Republican leadership is holding out against senate confirmation hearings or a vote after Barack Obama named Garland to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia , who died last month .
Republican senators insist that the next president should make the selection .
But Chuck Schumer , Democratic senator for New York , said in response to a question from the Guardian on Thursday : â€œWe are seeing cracks on the Republican side .
About five or six members have agreed already to meet with the nominee and I think what happened is they saw how stellar the nominee was and they realised how bad it would be not to ...
Theyâ€ ™ re feeling the heat and we believe weâ€ ™ ll see many more cracks over the next two weeks.â€ � Schumer and other Democratic senators addressed reporters outside the supreme court ahead of Garlandâ€ ™ s first meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon .
He was due to make courtesy calls on Democrats Harry Reid and Patrick Leahy but not on Republicans .
Billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has discovered Twitterâ€ ™ s polling function ...
Video â€ “ Top military official says Trumpâ€ ™ s plans would have â€˜adverse effectsâ€ ™ Kasich announces he will contest Utah , where Ted Cruz is expected to make a strong run among conservatives and Mormon voters .
Some observers raise an eyebrow , noting that by Utahâ€ ™ s rules , a candidate who takes a majority of the vote wins all 40 of the stateâ€ ™ s Republican delegates .
Wouldnâ€ ™ t that be a better outcome than a split verdict in which Trump snags some delegates from the state , bringing him closer to the coveted 1,237 majority ?
The Kasich camp says the point is still to keep Trump out of the delegates â€ “ by keeping him below a 15 % threshold for winning any delegates .
Update : itâ€ ™ s not clear that Kasich plan is so solid .
Because the 15 % threshold ceases to apply if only two candidates clear it .
Who is the Kasich camp counting on to clear it , apart from Cruz and Kasich ?
Florida senator Marco Rubio , who is still a senator for 10 months , has announced on Capitol Hill that he would not join a Republican ticket as anyoneâ€ ™ s vice presidential running mate ; that â€œIâ€ ™ m not running for [ Florida ] governor , â€ � and that he would not run for reelection to the senate , according to various media reports .
What will he do ?
You wonâ€

But .
This probably calls for gifs .
Here is video of senator Graham telling CNNâ€ ™ s Dana Bash about his decision to back Cruz .
He stops short of calling it an endorsement .
â€œJohn Kasich
I think is the most viable general election candidate , I just donâ€ ™ t see how John gets through the primary , â€ � Graham says .
â€œThis is an outsider year , heâ€ ™ s seen as an insider.â€ � â€œI think [ Cruz is ] the best alternative to Donald Trump , heâ€ ™ s certainly not
my preference , senator Cruz is not , â€ � Graham says .
â€œBut heâ€ ™ s a reliable Republican conservative , of which Iâ€ ™ ve had many differences with .
â€œI doubt Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s conservatism
and I think
heâ€ ™ d be a disaster for the party , so Iâ€ ™ m going to try to raise money for senator Cruz in the pro - Israel community.â€ �
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee is holding its annual policy conference in Washington next week .
Graham was to host a fundraiser Monday night .
â€œI think the best alternative to Donald Trump , to stop him from getting to 1,237 , is Ted Cruz , â€ �
Graham continued .
â€œIâ€
™ m going to help Ted in every way I can.â€ �
Asked about his past differences with Cruz , Graham says : â€œIt tells you a lot about where we are as a party.â€ �
Is it any coincidence that just as news breaks of Lindsey Grahamâ€ ™ s support for Ted Cruz , a bald eagle hatchling emerged from its shell in Washington , DC ?
â€œIf
you kill Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate , and the trial was in the Senate , nobody could convict you , â€ � Republican senator Lindsey Graham joked at a press club foundation dinner last month .
That was then .
Graham , heretofore one of Cruzâ€
™ s most vocal detractors in the senate , now plans to host a fundraiser for Cruz on Monday , CNN reports .
By now we know a bit about the presidential candidates , and more about state rules for delegate allocation than weâ€ ™ d care to .
But weâ€ ™ re trying to get a read on which issues matter most to you , our readers , this election cycle .
Itâ€ ™ s plain from your comments that income and wealth inequality , social issues , civil liberties , and US conduct on the international stage are central concerns .
But if you have a second weâ€ ™ d like for you to tell us : which election issue matters most to you ?
Thanks for taking the time !

Half of US women say they have a â€œvery unfavorableâ€ � view of Donald Trump , according to Reuters /
Ipsos polling , up from the 40 % who felt that way in October .
The survey was taken from March 1 - 15 , and included 5,400 respondents .
Reuters expands : The rise in anti - Trump sentiment among women could pose a problem for the New York billionaire in his quest for the White House .
Women form just over half of the U.S. population , and they have turned out at higher rates than men in every election since 1996 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
A big general election challenge for Trump â€ “ especially , perhaps ,
if heâ€ ™ s running against Hillary Clinton .

Hereâ€ ™ s a piece to go with the video we posted earlier , with expert advice on how to cope with Trump anxiety .
A Muslim - American , a woman , an African - American , a journalist and a Mexican - American describe what about
Trump concerns them :
US secretary of state John Kerry on Thursday declared that acts committed by Islamic State against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria are genocide , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Amanda Holpuch : Kerry did not say how such a declaration would affect US involvement in areas controlled by Isis .
â€œMy purpose in appearing before you today is to assert that in my judgment , Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis , Christians and Shia Muslims , â€ � Kerry said , using an Arabic acronym for the extremist group .
â€œDaesh is genocidal by self - proclamation , by ideology and by actions , in what it says , in what believes and in what it does.â€ �
John Kasich announces the endorsement of Michael Leavitt , former governor of Utah , which will award 40 Republican delegates in voting next Tuesday .
Anybody miss Ted Cruz on Megyn Kelly last night ?
Just in case , letâ€ ™ s review : Cruz told Kelly that Donald Trump finds her â€œa very very terrifying personâ€ � and accused Trump of being â€œscared to debate.â€ �
The Republicans scheduled a debate for Monday in Salt Lake City
but then Trump said he wasnâ€ ™ t going and Kasich followed suit , and the debate was canceled .
â€œThe race has shifted to a terrain that is not favorable for him , â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œThe closer we get to a one - on - one battle , the worse Donald Trump does.â€ �
Marco Rubio returns to his senate office , to warm welcome from staff .
The moment was captured by his comms team : Rubio got back to it after only two days .
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie withdrew from the race more than a month ago and he still hasnâ€ ™ t gone back to work !
( That isnâ€ ™ t strictly true .
He has been campaigning for Trump a lot and that has kept him away from his home state .
We kid because we love .
Without the love part . )
South Carolina governor and Donald Trump critic Nikki Haley told the local Post and Courier that she was not prepared to make a new endorsement after her favored presidential candidate , senator Marco Rubio , dropped out of the race Tuesday .
But she is praying for Ted Cruz , Haley said .
â€œAs of now
, I strongly believe I will support the Republican nominee , â€ � Haley said .
â€œThe only thing I can say now is my hope and my prayer is that senator Cruz can come through this .
â€œThatâ€
™ s who privately Iâ€ ™ m fighting for .
I do see a path for him , because I think heâ€ ™ s been solid and strong the entire way .
I think that heâ€ ™ s been disciplined in the way that heâ€ ™ s done

Three North Carolina sheriffâ€ ™ s deputies have been demoted and two suspended without pay for â€œunsatisfactory performanceâ€ � at a 9 March Donald Trump rally at which a protester was sucker punched â€ “ leading deputies to pounce on the protester , ignoring his assailant .
The disciplinary measures were announced on the Facebook page of Cumberland County sheriff Earl â€œMooseâ€ �
Butler .
â€œWe have disciplined five deputies following a professional standards investigation arising from the events at the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville ,
â€ � the statement said .
â€œThree deputies were demoted in rank , and they were suspended for a period of five days each without pay for unsatisfactory performance and failing to discharge the duties and policies of the Office of Sheriff .
â€œTwo other deputies were suspended for a period of three days without pay for unsatisfactory performance and the failure to discharge their duties.â€ � Hereâ€ ™ s video of the incident :
The assailant , John McGraw , was later charged with assault and battery .
In an interview at the rally he warned that the protester , Rakeem Jones , might be an Isis member and â€œthe next time we see him , we might have to kill him.â€
� Jones is not an Isis member .
He told local media that he was â€œsatisfiedâ€ � with the disciplining of the deputies but that his life had changed .
â€œWhen
I was threatened on national TV , this man was saying , â€˜we are going to have to kill himâ€ ™ ,â€ � Jones told TWCNews .
â€œThough Iâ€ ™ m satisfied with the discipline of the sheriffs , I would like to know who is â€˜weâ€ ™ â€ � .
The five disciplined deputies were placed on probationary status for a year , the sheriffâ€ ™ s statement said .
â€œThe actions of the deputies and their failures to act in situations such as that which occurred during the Trump rally at the Crown Coliseum have never been and will not ever be tolerated under the policies of this office , â€ � the statement said .
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson told CNN last night that there would be â€œa lot of turmoilâ€
�
if Donald Trump was nudged aside by the Republican party in a brokered convention , should Trumpâ€ ™ s lead in the nominating race remain strong .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no question that there would be a lot of turmoil if the establishment tries to thwart the will of the people , recognizing that millions of new voters have come into the Republican fold , largely as a result of Donald Trump , â€ � Carson said .
Carsonâ€ ™ s remarks were prompted by a warning by Trump Tuesday that if he holds a big lead going into the convention but not a full majority of delegates , and the party nominated someone else , â€œI think youâ€ ™
d have riots.â€ �
Rubio also warned of potential chaos from a brokered convention , in a conference call late Wednesday with supporters .
â€œWinning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it , even though you did it through the rules of the RNC , would be pretty much fatal for the party , â€ � Rubio said .
Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio has told Minnesota supporters on a conference call that he thinks fellow senator Ted Cruz is the â€œthe only conservative left in the race , â€ � the Twin Cities Pioneer Press reports .
Rubio did not endorse Cruz on the call .
He did warn of the dangers of potentially elevating a trailing candidate to nominee in a brokered convention .
Rubioâ€ ™ s comments followed an assessment late Wednesday by Ben Carson , also a former candidate , that â€œturmoilâ€ � would attend a contested convention .
â€œWinning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it , even though you did it through the rules of the RNC , would be pretty much fatal for the party , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThis election was entirely driven by national media coverage , in many ways , â€ � he said .
â€œWhen the media narrative goes negative on you , and all the news is bad , it kind of knocks us off.â€ � Read the full piece here .

Trump : making a joke of democracy â€ “ or revealing the power of the people ?
Obama is heading to Cuba next week : â€˜President Trumpâ€ ™ judged major threat to global economy :
Thanks for joining us for all our politics coverage today .
What news lines are you following this morning ?
Let us know in the comments !"
2016-03-18,"If you were Ted Cruz , and needed to break into the news cycle , consolidate conservative support , and stop the Trump juggernaut , what would you do ?
Easy : pick on Muslims .
Weâ€ ™ ve come to expect this from a party whose supposedly moderate candidates are still prejudiced .
Even so , Cruzâ€ ™ s latest move still has the power to dismay .
The presidential hopeful has named Frank Gaffney as a national security adviser to his campaign team .
For those of you who donâ€ ™ t know him , Gaffney is a conspiracy theorist whose obsessive focus on Islam and Muslims is clear from his stated concerns about a â€œworrying pattern of official US submission to Islam and the theo - political - legal program the latterâ€ ™ s
authorities call Shariahâ€ � .
He believes the redesigned logo of the Missile Defense Agency , for example â€œappears ominously to reflect a morphing of the Islamic crescent and star with the Obama campaign
logoâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s hard to find a better description of American decline : from the country that repeatedly put men on the moon to the country whose national security experts are searching for secret Islamic lunar motifs in government images .
Thatâ€ ™ s not to say that terrorists arenâ€ ™ t dangerous , that itâ€ ™ s Islamophobic to fear radicals , or that there arenâ€ ™ t deeply problematic interpretations of Islam .
But they are neither as widespread nor as dangerous as anti - Muslim alarmists like Gaffney claim they are .
As an American Muslim myself , who has worked for years with Muslim communities and advised on national security questions , I am endlessly amazed at the insecurities and anxieties of the American right .
Ronald Reagan faced down the Soviet Union .
His purported heirs , however , have become convinced that the worldâ€ ™ s most powerful nation is on the verge of being taken over by Islamists .
This isnâ€ ™ t just silly , though .
Itâ€ ™ s downright dangerous .
The war on terror was predicated on arguments like Gaffneyâ€ ™ s .
But one crucial part of it , Operation Iraqi Freedom , actually opened the door to Isis in the first place .
Which is why Gaffneyâ€ ™ s place on Cruzâ€ ™ s national security team should concern you , even if youâ€ ™ re not American or Muslim .
Cruz is , with Kasich , the only Republican alternative to Trump .
If there is a contested convention , there is a possibility he could be the nominee .
And though it seems unlikely , he is still one of the five people with a shot at being our next president .
Imagine , for a moment , that Frank Gaffney were advising a President Cruz on the right response to Isis or on a new Middle Eastern crisis .
He might shape the presidentâ€ ™ s relationship to American Muslim communities , which is genuinely terrifying , because Gaffney has no relationship to American Muslim communities except to demonize us , mislead the public about us
â€ “ witness his claim , paraded most recently by Trump , that â€œ27 % of Muslimsâ€ � are â€œmilitantsâ€ � .
Three more of Cruzâ€ ™ s
proposed national security advisers are from Gaffneyâ€
™ s thinktank , the Center for Security Policy .
Thereâ€
™ s no evidence of new or fresh thinking here
, not the least hint that Senator Cruz is aware of the lack of correspondence between Gaffneyâ€ ™ s theories and reality , the fact that most Muslims do not conform to the stereotypes he presents , or even any serious commitment to making America safe , let alone a nation that can lead .
Imagine , instead , a Republican candidate picking a national security adviser who is Muslim , who has roots in Muslim communities , who can build relationships of meaningful durability .
Someone who is trusted and reasonable , who can point out the difference between perceived threat and actual danger , and guide us to a more responsible foreign policy , a healthier and savvier relationship with hundreds of millions of people , a safer America and a safer planet .
Maybe thatâ€ ™ s just asking for the ( crescent ) moon ."
2016-03-21,"The aversion to Donald Trump is so strong among Utah Mormons that if the Republican frontrunner secures the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination , it could produce a general election outcome that has not happened in half a century : the state could go blue .
â€œThe Bible says if youâ€ ™ ve got a wicked leader , the nation suffers , â€ � said Chris Herrod , a former Utah state representative and a Utah campaign coordinator for Ted Cruz .
â€œIâ€
™ m not saying Donald Trump is wicked , but for most Utahns , the moral character of a leader makes a big difference.â€ �
At the stateâ€ ™ s high - stakes GOP caucuses on Tuesday , political experts say many conservative Mormon voters like Herrod will be motivated by their distaste for the real estate billionaireâ€ ™ s vulgar style , bombastic comments and outlandish anti - immigration policies â€ “ fueling an â€œanyone - but - Trumpâ€ � mentality that has spread across the political spectrum in the very red state .
A new Deseret News / KSL poll found Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in Utah , while Kasich or Cruz would both win the state by sizeable margins against either Democrat .
At Brigham Young University ( BYU ) , a college in Provo owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS ) , young Republican voters said Trumpâ€ ™ s behaviors and actions are fundamentally at odds with Mormon values .
â€œTrump is despicable â€ “ he makes me sick to my stomach , â€ � said Cameron Moon , a 26-year - old Mormon who plans to vote for Cruz .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s just really disgusting and vile.â€
�
Considering Trumpâ€
™ s
racism , sexism and bigotry , Moon said , he would be forced to vote for Clinton over Trump in November .
Jake Lee , a 25-year - old BYU senior and self - described â€œTea Party guyâ€ � , said he would also â€ “ very reluctantly â€ “ pick Clinton over Trump .
â€œIâ€ ™ m willing to swallow a pill of four years of bad to allow the Republican party to not have 20 years of horrible , â€ � said Lee , a Cruz supporter , arguing a Trump presidency would damage his party for decades .
â€œItâ€ ™ s four years of bad with Hillary .
Itâ€ ™ s four years of despicable with Donald Trump ,
â€ � added Moon , sitting in a lounge on the BYU campus , where hallways are lined with religious quotes and paintings .
Ashley Busby , a 22-year - old BYU senior and Republican , said she would even go so far as to consider becoming a Democrat if Trump were the GOP candidate .
â€œMy vote comes down to making sure Trump isnâ€ ™ t the nominee , â€ � said Busby , who had supported Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio and now plans to vote for Cruz .
â€œThe hatred from the Republican party that Iâ€ ™ ve seen during this election â€ “ and 90 % of it centered around Donald Trump â€ “ has made me so sad to be a member of this party , â€ � said Busby , adding that Mormonism teaches basic compassion for others â€ “ which Trump completely lacks .
Trumpâ€ ™ s 678 delegates have him comfortably ahead in the race â€ “ Texas senator Cruz has 423 , and Ohio governor John Kasich has only 143 .
But anti - Trump Republicans are hoping Utah will take a defiant stand against the businessman from New York who has struggled to gain traction among Mormon voters in the west .
On the heels of a Cruz victory in Idaho â€ “ which has the second - largest Mormon population in the US and delivered significant losses for Trump in heavily Mormon areas
â€ “ Utah could potentially offer an even bigger upset for the frontrunner .
With Rubio , Ben Carson and Jeb Bush out of the race , pundits say Cruz could potentially win all 40 of the delegates in Utah , where 63 % of the population is Mormon .
â€œTrump will finish third in Utah , â€ � said Mike Leavitt , former Utah governor and adviser to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney .
â€œUtah voters are not comfortable with the demeanor that heâ€ ™ s portraying , and itâ€ ™ s just very clear that thereâ€ ™ s a big chunk of the Utah population that would rather vote for a Democrat.â€
�
In a rare move , the Mormon church , which generally remains neutral in politics , issued a statement in December defending religious freedom and indirectly condemning Trumpâ€ ™ s proposed ban on Muslims entering the US .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re concerned about radical Muslims as well , â€ � said Herrod , whose Ukrainian father - in - law was born into a Muslim family and would be presumably be barred from the US if Trump were elected .
But Trump , he said , went too far .
In its rebuke , the church referenced a quote from Mormon founder Joseph Smith : â€œI am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian , a Baptist , or a good man of any denomination.â€ � â€œThe LDS population is a worldwide population , â€ � said Jason Perry , director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah .
â€œA significant number of families here in the state of Utah have children in other parts of the world on missions.â€ �
Trumpâ€ ™ s extreme rhetoric on immigration has also been a turnoff for some voters in Utah , which has increasingly emphasized dual - language programs in schools and worked to lure international companies to the state .
Romneyâ€ ™ s passionate criticisms of Trump and recent endorsement of Cruz could also sway the stateâ€ ™ s voters , and Trumpâ€ ™ s comment questioning Romneyâ€ ™ s Mormon faith could further hurt him at the Tuesday night caucuses .
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for an interview .
Some Utah Mormons are also arguing LDS principles should guide voters to not only snub Trump this week â€ “ but to consider crossing the aisle .
Warner Woodworth , a BYU business school professor emeritus , argued Mormon values of equality and â€œcommunal care for othersâ€ � clearly align with Bernie Sanders .
â€œGod through our scriptures says that the world lies in sin because of the great gap [ in wealth].â€ �
At the least , Woodworth , said he hoped Mormons would be disgusted enough by Trumpâ€ ™ s tone that they would make it harder for him to secure the nomination .
â€œThe way he talks , the curse words he uses , his racism , his bragging â€ “ all of those are so antithetical to Mormon religious values about humility , peace , listening to each other and coming together.â€ �"

2016-03-22,"Thatâ€ ™ s it from us tonight .
Hereâ€ ™ s a summary of the Final Five event , by the Guardianâ€ ™ s David Smith and Ben Jacobs : Just hours after Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump launched high - profileattacks against one another on foreign policy , the standoff continued into the night in back - to - back interviews on CNNâ€ ™
s
The Final Five candidatesâ€ ™ forum , writes Lucia Graves .
The event featured interviews from all the remaining candidates in the 2016 election , but interviews with John Kasich and even Ted Cruz seemed like mere accents â€ “ distractions , even â€ “ in a larger , highly gendered standoff between Clinton and Trump that could foreshadow a general election in which the politics of sex and sexism is at the fore .
Read more here : In an event billed as the single greatest meetup of the five remaining presidential candidates , the three Republican and two Democratic presidential candidates who joined CNNâ€ ™ s â€œFinal Fiveâ€ � town hall event did little to shock viewers â€ “ or even to venture far from the scripts they read during the Aipac convention meeting earlier today â€
“ but here are some of the highlights
: Ohio governor John Kasich couched himself as a strong anti - interventionist , telling Anderson Cooper that â€œwe should have let Gaddafi stay thereâ€ � during the Libyan civil war .
â€œAnytime
you mess in a civil war , any time you start to get in the middle of these problems directly , which is what we did , youâ€ ™
re gon na create problems , â€ � Kasich said .
Texas senator Ted Cruz attempted to tie foe Donald Trump to likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , telling Wolfe Blitzer that â€œWhat Donald Trump does is the same thing that Hillary Clinton
doesâ€
� on matters of state .
â€œToday , at Aipac , Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton before him promised to move the embassy [ to Jerusalem],â€ �
Cruz said , of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem .
â€œThe difference is that when I promise to do something , I do something.â€ �
Cruz got testy when Blitzer highlighted the history of his foreign policy advisor Frank Gaffney â€ “ who has said that Barack Obama is a hidden Muslim , that Chris Christie committed an act of treason by hiring a Muslim to a government position , that Saddam Hussein was behind the Oklahoma City bombing and that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the state department ( more on Gaffney here )
â€ “ dismissing questions about his stances as â€œsilly.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m actually interested in talking about problems in this country , â€ � Cruz said .
Donald Trump , when asked why he is so popular with white supremacists and neo - Nazis , pled ignorance .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know [ why they support me ] , because I am the least racist person youâ€ ™ ll ever meet , so I donâ€ ™ t know ,
â€ �
Trump said .
Trump also said that the 1,237-delegate required to win the Republican presidential nomination is â€œa little unfair , because I have been competing against â€ “ we started with over 17 people ...
When you talk about the majority plus one , itâ€ ™ s a very unfair situation because we had so many people running for office.â€ �
Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was more than conciliatory towards her sole Democratic opponent .
â€œSenator Sanders and I have run a campaign based on issues â€ “
we havenâ€
™ t been personally attacking each other and running negative ads , â€ � Clinton said , speaking admiringly of Sandersâ€ ™ zeal .
Clinton also said that she is held to a different standard than her male counterparts , particularly in relation to the volume of her voice and requests that she â€œsmile more.â€ �
â€œI donâ€ ™ t hear anybody say that about men â€ “ and Iâ€ ™ ve seen a lot of male candidates who donâ€ ™ t smile very much and who talk very loud , â€ � Clinton said .
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders denied that his candidacy is functionally over , despite a yawning gap in the delegate count between himself and Clinton .
â€œI think we have a road â€ “
a narrow road â€ “ but a road to victory , â€ � Sanders said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to drive up the voter turnout in November no matter who the nominee is ...
I am not a quitter
â€ “ we are gon na fight this to the last vote.â€ �
Hillary Clinton has moved toward a number of your positions , Anderson Cooper said .
â€œIf you could move her on one more policy , what would it be?â€ � â€œIt is not what a candidate says during a campaign , â€ � Ssanders said ; what is important is â€œwhat your record is and what your history is.â€ �
â€œMost Americans understand that somebody can not be an agent for change when they are so close to some of the most powerful special interests in this country , â€ � he continued .
â€œI think people have got to take everything into consideration.â€ � â€œHillary Clinton is the candidate of the establishment , â€ � he said .
â€œShe has the support of public officials across America .
What is also clear is that we are running an insurgent campaign across the country.â€
�
â€œI think as people look at our records , how we raise money , what our views are on income and wealth inequality , â€ � Sanders concluded , â€œthat is Bernie Sanders , and that is why we are creating so much excitement at the grassroots level.â€ �
On calling Donald trump a â€œpathological liar , â€ �
Bernie Sanders said that Trump may have a compulsion toward lying .
â€œHe just says things off the top of his head!â€ � Sanders said incredulously .
â€œTime after time he says things that are just not true , and I think more and more people understand that.â€ �
â€œThere is a reason why this guy will not be elected president of the United States .
That type of temperament , that type of violence , â€ � Sanders said , â€œis not what the American people want.â€ � â€œThereâ€ ™ s no question that he has authoritarian tendencies , â€ � Sanders said , echoing fellow senator Elizabeth Warrenâ€ ™ s remarks earlier today .
â€œI think that does he have a tendency toward authoritarianism ...
I think the evidence largely points in that direction.â€ � â€œIf Clinton clinches the nomination , are you hurting the Democratic nominee by remaining in the race?â€
� Anderson Cooper asks .
â€œI think we have a road - a narrow road - but a road to victory , â€ � Sanders said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to drive up the voter turnout in November no matter who the nominee is.â€ � â€œI am not a quitter -
we are gon na fight this to the last vote.â€
� â€œIn your view ,
in what way does Merrick Garland fail the progressive test?â€
�
Anderson Cooper asked .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s widely respected , clearly a very intelligent man , â€ � Sanders acknowledged , but â€œI believe that the supreme court decision six years ago on Citizens United was one of the worst court decisions in the history of our country ...
I do have a litmus test for a supreme court nominee , and that is I want that nominee to be loud and clear in telling the American people that he or she will overturn that decision.â€ � Bernie Sanders , on criticism of Cuba : Letâ€ ™ s not get into red - baiting here !
Would normalizing relations with Cuba entail inviting Raul Castro to the White House , Anderson Cooper asked .
â€œThe last I heard , weâ€ ™ ve invited the leaders of Saudi Arabia , weâ€ ™ ve invited the leaders of China , weâ€ ™ ve invited the leaders of a lot of authoritarian countries to the White House
- I think Cuba should be treated similarly ,
â€ � Sanders responded .
Bernie Sanders just called for the United States to be an honest broker in negotiations for peace between Israel and the Palestinians , breaking from the many Aipac - pandering policy statements fellow candidates have been making about Israel today .
Many Democrats have called for the same thing Sanders just did , but none of them was a Jew running for the presidency of the United States .
Savor the moment .
â€œWe are allies with Saudi Arabia , and it is time that they work with us - in fact , in my view , Isis is a real threat to Saudi Arabia , â€ � Bernie Sanders says , of attempting to unite Saudi Arabia with its geopolitical foe , Iran .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what our job is - to try to bring these countries together , â€ � Sanders said .
â€œWe are not the policemen of the world.â€ �
Anderson Cooper asked Bernie Sanders â€œwould you continue that much military aidâ€ � to Israel ?
â€œIsrael needs military aid , â€ � Sanders said , â€œbut this is what I will also tell you .
I want to see the United States providing economic stimulus to the region ...
I want to see the international community , with the help of Israel , with the help of the United States , rebuilding the devastation in Gaza.â€ � â€œI donâ€ ™ t know the answer to that one as well.â€ �
Sanders said , regarding the placement of the American embassy in Jerusalem .
â€œI am sympathetic to what president Obama has done in that area.â€ � â€œIs there any message people should read
intoâ€
� you skipping Aipac , Anderson Cooper asked Bernie Sanders via satellite .
â€œI wanted to be there - it was simply a question of scheduling , â€ � Sanders said .
â€œIsrael must continue to exist as an independent , free state .
But if we are to have lasting peace , we have also got to work with the Palestinians , â€ � Sanders said .
â€œIt can not be that the United States just takes the side of Israel.â€ � â€œOverwhelmingly , the United States , time and time again , has looked aside when Israel has done some bad things .
I think , for example , that the growth of settlements in Palestinians territories is not acceptable to me , â€ � Sanders said .
â€œI think there is no question that thereâ€ ™ s enough blame to go around on both sides .
Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist attacks ...
but I think the United States is stronger when we work with both sides.â€ � Anderson Cooper asked Hillary Clinton if she is being held to a different standard from her male counterparts .
This , after having asked if relations with Israel might be affected by tendency to get emotion , to lose her cool , and by reputation as the â€œyeller - in - chiefâ€ � .
Her response was dead - on : â€œI donâ€
™ t hear anybody say that about men â€ “ and Iâ€ ™ ve seen a lot of male candidates who donâ€ ™ t smile very much and who talk very loud , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œEvery time I have a job , I get really , really high ratings ,
â€ �
Clinton noted , speaking of her discomfort with campaigning versus governing .
â€œWhenever
I have a job , I work really hard to do it to the best of my capacity.â€ � â€œDoing the job , getting results for people , making a difference for our country , thatâ€ ™ s what I feel best at and what Iâ€ ™ m committed to doing , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œBut actually going out and campaigning , it is harder .
It is harder for me.â€ �
Part of it , Clinton said , is that campaigning â€œseems harder than women.â€ �
â€œAre you held to a different standard?â€ �
Cooper asked , because of your gender ?
â€œI
donâ€
™ t hear anybody say that about men - and Iâ€ ™ ve seen a lot of male candidates who donâ€ ™ t smile very much and who talk very loud , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œSenator Sanders
and I have run a campaign based on issues - we havenâ€ ™ t been personally attacking each other and running negative ads , â€ � Clinton said , speaking admiringly of her Democratic opponent .
â€œAre you in favor of expanding Obamacare to undocumented immigrants?â€ �
Anderson Cooper asks .
â€œThere are two steps here : If someone can afford to pay for an insurance policy off the exchanges that were set up under the Affordable Care Act , I support it , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that because the subsidies have to be worked out in comprehensive immigration reform.â€ �
As for deportation , Clinton says that â€œpeople who are already here have to be in a separate category ...
I want to stop the raids and the roundups .
I donâ€
™ t believe we should be breaking up families and deporting mothers and fathers , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œI want to get comprehensive immigration reform , and I want to start getting it as soon as Iâ€ ™ m elected president.â€ �
â€œBut doesnâ€ ™ t allowing undocumented immigrants to stay reward them for breaking the law?â€ � Cooper asked .
â€œI do think people have to pay a fine - because yes , they came here without legal authorization , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œBut they should be in the pipeline and they should be given legal authority to work - which I think actually helps the whole economy.â€ � â€œRight now , there is no net migration from Mexico , â€ � Clinton noted .
A very shrewd tactic on the part of Hillary Clinton to remind viewers of what Donald Trump has said .
It may be shrewd politically , because Trump may be his own worst enemy .
And personally , because , you know , Chelsea and Ivanka are pals , and itâ€ ™ s easier to answer a question about his personality by pointing to things heâ€
™ s said than answering directly .
â€œI think when it comes to understanding what he would do as president , there are serious questions that have been raised , â€ � Clinton said .
Trump said earlier that of lot of what he says is â€œshow businessâ€ � that â€œthe peopleâ€ � will understand that .
Clinton may well be banking on the fact that other people do understandâ€ “ and they donâ€ ™ t like the idea of pomp rather than substance .
Anderson Cooper asked about encryption of phones recovered from terror suspects , and whether technology companies should be compelled to unlock their own devices .
â€œI really want to see a resolution to this - now itâ€ ™ s caught up in the legal process , as you know , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œI think weâ€ ™ ve got a lot of really smart people in our tech community , in our government , who somehow have to come to terms with this.â€ � â€œYouâ€ ™ re not taking a side , â€ � Cooper noted .
â€œSometimes you have to keep working a problem until you get some break in that ...
I hope itâ€ ™ s not an either / or , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œPeople working in the tech communitiy also have a stake in preventing terrorist attacks on our shores and keeping people safe .
How do they do that?â€ �
Anderson Cooper , noting that the US relationship with Cuba is rapidly evolving from decades of stagnation , asked Hillary Clinton about dissidents under Juan Castroâ€ ™ s Cuba .
â€œI support the presidentâ€ ™
s efforts to move the relationship forward , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œI know that the president will be meeting with some dissidents , and I heartily approve of that.â€ � Noting that Hillary Clinton was â€œthe designated yeller - in - chiefâ€ � with Israel during the Obama administration , Anderson Cooper asks â€œhow would your relationship with Israel be better?â€ � â€œI am staunchly in favor of Israelâ€ ™ s security , and although we may have differences , and we do ...
I think my firm commitment on Israelâ€ ™ s security puts me in a very sound positionâ€ � to address relations with the nation .
â€œIn general , the relationship remains very strong and essential to United States foreign policy , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œWe engage in vigorous discussion - I like that!â€ � Clinton said , about having ever yelled at Israeli prime minister Bibi Netanyahu .
â€œWe have a raucous democracy , Israel has a raucous democracy ...
A give - and - take between friends is the best and most honest way to come to any resolution .
So yes , Iâ€ ™ ve had my disagreements , but Iâ€ ™ ve also never strayed from my strong commitment to Israeli security.â€ �
On the heels of her speech at Aipac , Anderson Cooper asked Hillary Clinton about the Iranian nuclear deal , which has been roundly criticized by Iranian leadership .
â€œWe have put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œI think on balance it was the right step to take , but Iâ€ ™ ve also said , look ... the slightest infraction needs to have consequences .
I think itâ€ ™ s not trust and verify , itâ€ ™ s distrust and verify.â€ �
In response to her â€œeverythingâ€ ™ s negotiableâ€ � comment directed at Donald Trump , Cooper asked if she thought that Trump is unqualified to be president .
â€œI am quoting him - I think
itâ€ ™ s important to listen to what he says .
You have to take him at his word , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œI think when it comes to understanding what he would do as president , there are serious questions that have been raised.â€ � â€œWho knows?â€
�
Clinton asked rhetorically , on whether there is a â€œrealâ€ � Donald Trump .
â€œI think you have to take him at his word : how he has behaved and what he has said.â€ �
Hillary Clinton , Trump tells CNNâ€ ™ s
Wolf Blitzer , â€œdoesnâ€ ™ t have the staminaâ€ � to be president , even though she and Trump are the same age .
Blitzer reasonably asks if Trump has any reason to say that â€ “ and of course , Trump doesnâ€ ™ t need reasons to say anything .
Instead , he relies on subtle suggests that Clinton isnâ€ ™ t man enough to do a manâ€ ™ s job .
â€œHillary Clinton does not have the stamina , doesnâ€ ™ t have the energy , she doesnâ€ ™ t
have it .
Doesnâ€ ™ t have the strength to be president.â€ �
Trump knows why so many women dislike him , but he clearly doesnâ€ ™ t see that as a net loss as he continues through the race .
â€œI think she doesnâ€ ™ t have the stamina , â€ � Donald Trump said , in response to a question about why he thinks Hillary Clinton doesnâ€ ™ t have the stamina to he president .
â€œYou watch her life .
You watch how sheâ€ ™ ll go away three or four days ; sheâ€ ™ ll come back .
Sheâ€ ™ ll go -
I just donâ€ ™ t think she has the stamina.â€ � â€œSheâ€ ™ s always got problems , whether itâ€ ™ s Whitewater , or whether itâ€ ™ s the e - mails or - itâ€ ™ s always - itâ€ ™ s always drama .
It should end .
It should end .
She shouldnâ€ ™ t even be running .
Honestly , she shouldnâ€ ™ t be allowed to run based on the e - mails , okay , to be totally honest with you .
Sheâ€ ™ s being protected .
But Hillary Clinton does not have the stamina , doesnâ€ ™ t have the energy , she doesnâ€ ™ t
have it .
Doesnâ€ ™ t have the strength to be president , in my opinion.â€ �
Wolf Blitzer quoted Fox News , which issued a statement criticizing Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œvitriolic attacks against Megyn Kelly and ... extreme sick obsession with her is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate.â€ �
â€œSheâ€ ™ s got the obsession !
Sheâ€ ™ s the one that puts me on her show every night !
Look at her show!â€ �
Trump said .
â€œLook at the airtime I get on her show , and I donâ€
™ t do her show !
She wants me to do it so badly .
Roger Ailes wants me to do her show so badly .
They want to have a primetime special on Fox network where Megyn Kelly interviews me .
I said , whatâ€ ™ s in it for me?â€
�
â€œNow , in the meantime , sheâ€ ™ s benefited greatly , â€ �
he said .
â€œSheâ€
™ s hotter now than ever before because of me .
She should give me at least of half of her salary.â€ �
Wolf Blitzer plays an ad from a Republican super - PAC : â€œHas your language come back to haunt
you?â€ �
Wolf Blitzer asks .
â€œNo .
I think people understand .
I think people understand .
First of all , half of that was show business .
The dropping to the knees , that was in The Apprentice .
The Rosie Oâ€ ™ Donnell stuff .
But I think people understand.â€
�
â€œLook ,
these politicians ...
they say far worse when theyâ€ ™ re in closed doors or where theyâ€ ™ re with a group of people that they trust .
A lot of that show business stuff .
And you know in Florida ,
the amazing thing , they spent $ 38 million in negative ads on me , and you know what , I won by a record landslide .
Pretty amazing.â€ � â€œBut thatâ€ ™ s not how you feel about women in those words?â€
�
Blitzer asks .
â€œNobody respects women more than I do .
Nobody takes care of the women - and they take care of me because they do such a great job.â€ � Donald Trump , on violence as his rallies : We have not had anybody really hurt .
After noting that he used the word â€œriotsâ€ � twice - which Trump nearly attempts to dismiss - Wolf Blitzer asks Donald Trump if he will â€œunequivocally say to your supporters , you donâ€ ™ t want any violence , you donâ€ ™ t want any riots at the convention?â€
�
â€œOf course
I would , 100 percent .
But I have no control over the people!â€ � â€œThese people have been disenfranchised , â€ �
Trump said , saying that theyâ€ ™ re too mad to listen to him .
â€œThey lost their jobs .
They make less money now than they made 12 years ago .
People that are working hard and working double jobs are making less money now in real dollars than they made 12 years ago .
They are - they see their jobs going to Japan and to China and to Mexico .
Mexico , forget it , itâ€ ™ s the new China .
You know what , theyâ€ ™ re very - theyâ€ ™ re not by nature angry people , but I will tell you , right now theyâ€ ™ re angry people.â€ �
But surely the greatest dealmaker in the world could calm them down , Blitzer asks .
â€œIâ€ ™ d certainly try , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to see - but theyâ€ ™ re very angry people .
They have been misled by politicians for years , and theyâ€ ™ re tired of it .
And thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ m doing so well , and thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ m leading.â€
� Donald Trump , whose candidate forum interview is currently airing , told the Washington Postâ€ ™ s editorial board on Monday that he would be a hawkish president who leaves a light footprint .
You donâ€ ™ t have to be a policy wonk to know he wants two things that donâ€ ™ t go together .
The more the media focuses on Trumpâ€ ™ s foreign policy , the more vulnerable he is going to appear , because the bottom line â€ “ repeated references to his â€œhandsâ€ � aside
â€
“ is that he tends to sound like Barack Obama .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re spending trillions of dollars in the Middle East .
You know where we are now ?
Weâ€
™ re further back than we were 15 years ago .
We are in such bad shape .
The Middle East is a disaster for us ,
â€ �
Trump told Wolf Blitzer .
â€œAnd in the meantime our country is crumbling , we have a country , the roads are no good .
â€œ
Hereâ€ ™ s what Obama said in 2011
( bolding mine ) : We are a nation whose strength abroad has been anchored in opportunity for our citizens at home .
Over the last decade , we have spent a trillion dollars on war , at a time of rising debt and hard economic times .
Now , we must invest in Americaâ€ ™ s greatest resource â€ “ our people .
We must unleash innovation that creates new jobs and industry , while living within our means .
We must rebuild our infrastructure ...
America , it is time to focus on nation building here at home .
The Republican frontrunner is not sounding so Republican , despite his repeated indictments of the Obama presidency .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s say you show up in Cleveland at the Republican convention , and
donâ€ ™ t have that the magic number of 1,237 which is the number you need to be guaranteed on the first ballot if youâ€ ™ re going to be the Republican - letâ€ ™ s say youâ€ ™ re 20 or 100 short , â€ � Wolf Blitzer floated .
â€œThe chairman of the Republican Party , Reince Priebus
, he says that thatâ€ ™ s not the rules , that they would have to go along with the rules .
What would happen if youâ€ ™ re just short?â€ �
Trump complained , saying that the 1,237-delegate required to win the presidential nomination is â€œa little unfair , because I have been competing against -- we started with over 17 people .
Then we go down to 15 , and then 12 , and 11 and 10 .
And I had many , many people that Iâ€ ™ m competing with.â€ � â€œWhen
you talk about the majority plus one , itâ€ ™ s a very unfair situation because we had so many people running for office , so one would get 2 percent , one would get 4 percent , one would - and I was always in the lead , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI mean , just about from the beginning Iâ€ ™ ve been leading .
But itâ€ ™ s very unfair when I have all of these people running , itâ€ ™ s not like Iâ€ ™
m running against two people or three people , Hillary is running against one person .
So I think thatâ€ ™ s very unfair.â€
� â€œMathematically , itâ€ ™ s unfair
, â€ �
Trump said again .
â€œItâ€ ™ s almost impossible to believe that I should do that , that I would be able to do it .
I think Iâ€ ™ ll be able to do it .
But I will say this : If I was at 1,190 , so Iâ€ ™ m a little bit off , and I have millions of votes more than anybody else - because right now I have 2 million votes more than anybody else running for office , by a lot .
Itâ€ ™ s not even close.â€
� â€œI have millions of votes more than anybody else
thatâ€ ™ s running - millions of votes ...
so mathematically itâ€
™ s unfair.â€
�
â€œWhy do you think these white supremacists , these various white supremacists out there are supporting your campaign?â€
�
Wolf Blitzer asked Donald Trump .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know , because I am the least racist person youâ€ ™ ll ever meet , so I donâ€ ™ t know , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œAnd I donâ€ ™ t know that they really are .
I mean , youâ€ ™ re telling me that , so I donâ€ ™ t know ...
â€ �
Blitzer noted that the Anti - Defamation League , an organization working against anti - Semitism , put out a list of white supremacists and neo - Nazis who are working for and supporting Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign .
â€œI
just donâ€
™ t know .
I mean , you are telling me this , but I donâ€
™ t know why .
I am certainly the least racist person , â€ �
Trump insisted .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t want their support , I donâ€ ™ t want their support , I donâ€ ™ t need their support.â€ �
Wolf Blitzer also played a clip from Clintonâ€ ™ s speech during the Aipac conference today in which she implicitly compared Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy to that of Adolf Hitler .
â€œEncouraging violence , playing coy with white supremacists , calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported , demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United States - if you see bigotry , oppose it .
If you see violence condemn it .
If you see a bully , stand up to him.â€ �
Trump ignored the substance of Clintonâ€ ™ s argument .
â€œI mean , look , we have to be vigilant ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œOur country is under siege .
Weâ€ ™ re under attack .
Weâ€
™ re under attack in virtually every way
: Our economy is falling apart ; weâ€ ™ re sitting on a big fat bubble ; our trade deals are no good ; our health care is no good ; our security is no good .
â€œLook what happens in our country !
Our security is no good .
People are pouring across the border .
People that are convicted criminals are pouring across the border .
We have to be vigilant , we have to be smart or weâ€ ™ re not going to have a country
any longer.â€ � Donald Trump , on what Palestinians could do for â€œneutralityâ€
�
â€œWell , let me tell you - well , the one thing they have to do is they have to end terror , okay ?
They have to stop with the terror because what theyâ€ ™ re doing with the missiles and with the stabbings and with all of the other things that they do , itâ€ ™ s horrible and theyâ€ ™ ve got to - itâ€
™ s got to end.â€
�
â€œNow , I have many , many friends from Israel and Jewish friends .
Everybody wants to see peace .
It seems to me the all - time Olympics in peace in a deal .
Can you make that deal between Israel and the Palestinians ?
I think the answer is , maybe .
I never say that.â€ �
â€œTrom the time
theyâ€ ™ re born , theyâ€ ™ re educated a certain way , â€ �
Trump said , of Palestinians .
â€œItâ€
™ s got to change .
Thereâ€ ™ s a bad mindset going on , Wolf.â€ �
After playing a clip from Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s speech in front of Aipac this morning , in which she said â€œwho says heâ€ ™ s neutral on Monday , pro - Israel on Tuesday , and who knows what on Wednesday , because everythingâ€ ™ s negotiable , â€ � Trump said Clinton â€œdoesnâ€ ™ t know me.â€
� â€œI have the steadiest hands - look at these hands , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI have the steadiest hands - and far steadier than hers .
Look where she got us .
I mean , look at Libya , look at the migration , look at Benghazi !
I mean hereâ€ ™ s a woman
thatâ€ ™ s talk .
Sheâ€ ™ s
just - you know , sheâ€ ™ s just reading it off a teleprompter .
All she does - believe me , they write that for her .
Look at the job , probably in history - although I think John Kerry may even be worse , Iâ€ ™ m not sure after the Iran deal .
But look at what sheâ€ ™ s done.â€ �
On whether he would , as promised , be neutral on issues relating to Israel , Trump said â€œI would love to be neutral if itâ€ ™ s possible.â€ � â€œItâ€ ™
s probably not possible , because thereâ€ ™ s so much hatred ,
â€ �
Trump continued .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s so much going on .
I am very pro - Israel .
Iâ€ ™ ve always been pro - Israel .
I have many awards from Israel , many awards .
Iâ€ ™ ve contributed a lot of money to Israel .
Thereâ€ ™ s
nobody more pro - Israel than I am .
We have to protect Israel .
Israel is so important to us.â€

On the heels of his first scripted speech since launching his presidential campaign , billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was pressed by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer about international relations and the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( Nato ) .
â€œThis is your first day in Washington in quite a while , â€ �
Blitzer said .
â€œDo
you think the United States needs to rethink US involvement in Nato?â€
� â€œYes , because itâ€ ™ s costing us too much money , and frankly , they have to put up more money , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re going to have to put some up also .
Weâ€ ™
re paying disproportionately ,
itâ€ ™ s too much , and frankly , itâ€ ™ s a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea and everybody got together .
â€œBut weâ€ ™ re taking care of , as an example , the Ukraine , â€ �
Trump continued .
â€œI mean , the countries over there donâ€ ™ t seem to be so interested .
Weâ€ ™ re the ones taking the brunt of it .
So I think we have to reconsider
- keep Nato
but maybe we have to pay a lot less toward the Nato itself.â€
�
When asked whether this position would alienate American allies , Trump was unconcerned .
â€œWell , they might not be happy , but you know , they have to help us also .
It has to be - we are paying disproportionately , and very importantly , if you use Ukraine as an example , and thatâ€ ™ s a great example , the countries surrounding Ukraine , I mean , they donâ€ ™ t seem to care as much about it as we do.â€ �
In a pre - taped interview with Blitzer for the CNN town hall , billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump flip - flopped yet again on whether to deploy ground troops to fight Isis in the Middle East , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs .
In the last Republican debate in Miami , Trump said â€œI would listen to the generals , but Iâ€ ™ m hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000 .
We have to knock them out fast.â€ �
In the interview with Blitzer , though , Trump insisted he wouldnâ€
™ t not send ground troops .
â€œHowever I wouldnâ€ ™ t deploy 20,000 .
Iâ€ ™
d get people from that part of the world to put up the troops , and Iâ€ ™ d certainly give them air power and air support and some military support , â€ � said the frontrunner .
Trump insisted â€œI would never ever put up 20,000 or 30,000.â€ �
Donald Trump doubled down on his calls for the US to be less involved in Nato .
He told the Washington Post â€œI think Nato as a concept is good , but it is not as good as it was when it first evolvedâ€ � and insisted the United States should play a less significant role in the organization .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re paying disproportionately ,
itâ€ ™ s too much , and frankly , itâ€ ™ s a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea and everybody got together
, â€ � said Trump .
He alleged of the Ukraine , where Russia has invaded and drawn major concern from western and central European allies , â€œthe countries surrounding Ukraine , I mean , they donâ€ ™ t seem to care as much about it as we do.â€
�
The real estate mogul also touched various other foreign policy issues , insisting when it comes to international crises , â€œI have the steadiest handsâ€ � and bragging about once serving as grand marshal of an Israel Day parade when asked about the Middle East .
The Republican frontrunner , facing the possibility of the first contested convention in decades , insisted it did not matter if he didnâ€ ™ t get the 1237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot .
â€œWhen you talk about the majority plus one , itâ€ ™ s a very unfair situation because we had so many people running for office , â€ � said Trump .
He added , â€œif I was at 1,190 , so Iâ€ ™ m a little bit off , and I have millions of votes more than anybody else , because right now I have 2 million votes more than anybody else running for office , by a lot .
Itâ€ ™ s not even close.â€ �
He echoed past comments that â€œthere could very well be riotsâ€ � if he was denied the nomination but insisted â€œthat happened Iâ€ ™ ll have no part in it.â€ �
Trump also defended his Twitter attacks on Fox News personality Megyn Kelly .
â€œEvery night , the show , itâ€ ™ s like an infomercial , always negative stuff , always negative stuff , always , â€ � insisted Trump .
â€œNot fair .
So I will fight back with Twitter .
I will let people know sheâ€ ™ s a third rate talent .
I will say what I have to say , itâ€ ™ s very simple.â€ �
Donald Trump has been critical of Chinaâ€ ™ s geopolitics throughout his campaign , but itâ€ ™ s surprising that heâ€ ™ s pretty much the only candidate to harp on this , considering other GOP candidatesâ€ ™ stated views on foreign governments .
For instance , Ted Cruz appears to believe that any state with a record of human rights abuses does not deserve the privilege of doing business with America .
As he put it this evening , what President Obama is doing this week in Cuba is pretty much the same thing he did with Iran : alienating our allies and emboldening our enemies .
â€œWhat this will do is this will strengthen the repressive regime , â€ �
he told Wolf Blitzer .
The same sentiment might be said of China , but saying so would alienate the Republican business elites .
â€œI have zero interest whatsoever in this ,
â€ �
Ted Cruz said of serving as Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s vice - presidential campaign mate .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re seeing Republicans uniting against this campaign , â€ � Cruz said , noting that Lindsey Graham , who once compared choosing to support Cruz to being poisoned .
After playing a clip of Donald Trump calling him â€œLyinâ€ ™ Ted , â€ � and noting his disapproval among evangelical voters .
â€œEvery time Donald gets scared , he begins lashing out , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œI will say this - Donaldâ€ ™ s campaign , his entire campaign is built on a lie.â€ � â€œI understand the people who are supporting Donald - they are frustrated with Washington , â€ � he continued .
â€œBut if youâ€ ™ re fed up with Washington , withb the corruption of Washington , then it doesnâ€ ™ t make any sense to support Donald Trump ...
he is the system.â€ � â€œDonald trump has made billions buying influence in Washington ; Hillary Clinton has made millions selling influence in Washington.â€ �
â€œWhat Obamaâ€ ™ s doing in Cuba is actually very much the same as what heâ€ ™ s doing in Iran ,
â€ �
Cruz said , lambasting Barack Obama for opening up relations with Cuba .
â€œWe should be standing up to enemies of America - we shouldnâ€ ™ t be giving billions of dollars to people who hate us , â€ �
Cruz said .
â€œWhat this will do is this will strengthen the repressive regime of the Castros.â€ �
â€œThere is power in standing up and speaking the truth to evil , and what this president does is the opposite , â€ � Cruz concludes .
Frank Gaffney , one of Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s new foreign policy advisors , has said that Barack Obama is a hidden Muslim , that Chris Christie committed an act of treason by hiring a Muslim to a government position , that Saddam Hussein was behind the Oklahoma City bombing and that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the state department - Blitzer asked Cruz whether thatâ€ ™ s the kind of person who will be working in a Cruz administration .
Smiling , Cruz said that â€œfolks in the media get really nervous when you actually call out radical Islamic terrorism.â€ �
â€œHeâ€ ™ s endured attacks from the left , from the media , because he speaks out against radical Islamic terrorism , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know what he said in 2009 , I donâ€ ™ t have the full context , Iâ€ ™ m not interested in playing the media â€˜gotchaâ€ ™ game.â€ �
â€œDefending America means defeating radical Islamic terrorism and defeating Isis , â€ �
Cruz said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m actually interested in talking about problems in this country
- this is silly.â€ �
Ted Cruz dismissed Donald Trump as likely â€œunawareâ€ � of Americaâ€ ™ s commitment to Americaâ€ ™ Nato allies .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll bet you dollars to donuts Donald has no idea about that , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThat is so hopelessly naive , and what Donald Trump has said is that he would unilaterally surrender to Russia and Putin - give Russia a massive foreign policy victory - and abandon Nato , â€ �
Cruz said .
â€œWhen you saw leaders of the world marching with Paris , and singularly absent was America ...
that reflects Obamaâ€ ™ s leading from behind , and Trumpâ€ ™ s foreign policy is Obama - Hillary leading from behind.â€ �
Tonight , John Kasich and Ted Cruz are once again using a national news platform to attempt to beat back the tide of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy .
The only thing missing is the supporting role from Fox News showing high - definition graphics of Trumpâ€ ™ s flip - flopping .
CNN of course would never do that , but it is doing a bang - up job of enabling the co - conspirators to frame their policy views as all things anti - Trumpian .
Next thing you know , someone will admit to liking Cruz .
â€œToday , at Aipac , Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton before him promised to move the embassy [ to Jerusalem],â€ �
Cruz said , of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem .
â€œThe difference is that when I promise to do something , I do something.â€ � â€œWhen
I say it
, I say it taking the consequences into account - itâ€ ™ s not just empty campaign rhetoric , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œMoving the embassy to Jerusalem makes a statement that America is back.â€ �
â€œThe era of appeasement under the Obama - Clinton foreign policy is over , â€ �
Cruz concluded .
On the heels of a speech at Aipac that criticized Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s former stance of â€œneutralityâ€ � on the issue of Israeli - Palestinian relations , Ted Cruz doubled down on declaring that Trump is insufficiently pro - Israel .
â€œWhat that suggests is that he buys into the moral equivalency that many in the media pitch , â€ �
Cruz said of Trumpâ€ ™ s previous stance .
â€œIf you think that the state of Israel is somehow morally equivalent to terrorists ...
â€ �
â€œThe Palestinian Authority is in a so - called unity government with Hamas , a terrorist organization , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m happy to try to broker a deal from the beginning -
but the difference is that you need a president who stands with Israel , who doesnâ€ ™ t accept this moral equivalence.â€ �
â€œWhat Donald Trump does is the same thing that Hillary Clinton does.â€ �
Anderson Cooper asks John Kasich , the governor of Ohio , about Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s floating of the idea that there would be riots in Cleveland if his nomination is denied him .
â€œThis would happen under your watch - are you planning on calling the Ohio National Guard?â€ � â€œWe always manage events where we think there could be problems the best we can , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œBut that kind of language is not acceptable ...
We have to be better than that kind of language.â€ � â€œYouâ€ ™ re the only Republican who beats Hillary Clinton in a head - to - head matchup , â€ � and yet
the majority of Republicans want John Kasich to drop out , Cooper noted .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think anybodyâ€ ™ s going to have enough delegates to win the nomination before the convention , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œDelegates are gon na think about two things : Who can win ?
Iâ€ ™ m the only one who can win in a general election .
And number two : Who can be president?â€ �
After playing a robocall of Mitt Romney encouraging Utah voters to vote for Ted Cruz and telling voters that â€œa vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump , â€ � Kasich was unhappy .
â€œHow do you come out one week and say heâ€
™ s got a great record and the next week ...
â€ � Kasich trailed off .
â€œI donâ€
™ t get this - are we thinking about just the Republican nomination?â€ � â€œThereâ€ ™ s zero change
I would be vice president for either of them - zero .
Less than zero , â€ � Kasich said , of serving on the ticket with either Ted Cruz or Donald Trump .
Here is John Kasich , first of the five interviewees , telling the truth about Libya , signaling a willingness to poke Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s soft underbelly .
He said that it was a mistake to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi and pinned Libyaâ€ ™ s current malaise firmly on the former secretary of state .
â€œAny time you start getting in the middle of these kind of problems directly , which is what we did , you create problems , â€ � he said .
CNNâ€ ™ s Anderson Cooper appears to be stunned that a Republican candidate for the presidency would suggest a dictator be left in power .
It was a softball question that turned into a line drive down the middle .
John Kasich , on whether Donald Trump is ready to lead : Thatâ€ ™ s up to the people to decide .
â€œUnder your presidency , would companies [ like Airbnb ] be forced out of Cuba?â€ �
â€œI donâ€ ™ t want to expand any more - Iâ€ ™ d have to think about exactly what Iâ€ ™ d do , â€ � Kasich said .
Cooper asked Kasich whether he would intervene with troops on the ground in the Libyan civil war to defeat Isisâ€ ™ s presence there .
â€œWe should have left Qaddafi stay there - he was cooperating with us , and by knocking him out we turned this into the Wild West , â€ � Kasich said , criticizing Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s tenure as secretary of state .
â€œAnytime
you mess in a civil war , any time you start to get in the middle of these problems directly , which is what we did , youâ€ ™
re gon na create problems , â€ � Kasich said , saying that he would not have intervened in the Libyan civil war .
â€œTo have a huge troop presence there , for a long time , I donâ€
™ t think makes sense.â€ � â€œIs experience in making deals - does it transfer to statesmanship?â€ �
Cooper asks , referring to Donald Trump , who has no political experience .
â€œFrankly , when youâ€ ™ re a politician , people wonder if you can transfer that experience to business - and I did , â€ � Kasich said , emphasizing his history as a successful banker after he left Congress to work for the now - defunct investment bank Lehman Bros.
â€œIâ€ ™ m the only one that has the legislative , and the executive , and the business experience in the race ,
â€ � Kasich concluded .
On the heels of the Ohio governorâ€ ™ s speech in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( Aipac ) conference in Washington , DC , anchor Anderson Cooper asked John Kasich whether Donald Trump is strong enough of an ally for Israel .
â€œThirty - five years Iâ€ ™ ve supported Israel - weâ€ ™ ve got to be clear to strengthen NATO ...
weâ€ ™ re providing them with the lethal defensive equipment that we need , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t want to ever put them in a position where they donâ€ ™ t have superiority.â€ � â€œI want to make sure that theyâ€ ™ re strong and the strongest in the region , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m told today that there is some progress with the Palestinians on keeping some of the violence in check .
My whole point , Anderson , in regard to Israel and the Middle East is stability .
Itâ€ ™ s a matter of getting through each day with a lid on things.â€
�
â€œItâ€ ™ s easy to make a lot of statements - but when you have a lot of experience in this matter , which I have ...
you learn to choose your words carefully , and I think today that I was very strong in that speech.â€ �
Good evening , and welcome to the Guardianâ€ ™ s live blog of CNNâ€ ™
s â€œFinal Fiveâ€ � presidential forum , a first - of - its - kind town hall event where the five remaining presidential candidates from both major political parties will join CNNâ€ ™ s Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer on the same stage â€ “ albeit , not at the same time .
Four of the candidates â€ “ former secretary of state Hillary Clinton , Texas senator Ted Cruz , Ohio governor John Kasich and New York businessman Donald Trump â€
“ will be live in - studio , with Vermont senator Bernie Sanders joining the broadcast via satellite from Salt Lake City .
Coming on the heels of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( Aipac ) conference meeting in Washington DC , where each of the four candidates planning to appear in - studio spoke today , the town hall will likely feature a wide range of foreign - policy questioning , particularly of candidates who used the speech to poke at their unnamed rivals .
Clinton , for example , implicitly compared Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy to the rise of Adolf Hitler , while Cruz mentioned in an aside that candidates who have pledged neutrality on the issue of Israel werenâ€ ™ t true allies of the Jewish state .
As for nuts and bolts of tonightâ€ ™ s event : The event will air from 8 - 11 pm ET on CNN , CNN International and CNN en EspaÃ±ol .
The town hall event will be hosted by CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer .
The event will take place just before the so - called â€œWestern Tuesdayâ€ � primary contests in Arizona , Utah and , for the Democrats , Idaho .
Each candidate will be be individually interviewed in the CNN Election Center in Washington , DC , with the exception of Sanders , who will be interviewed from the campaign trail .
In addition to myself â€ “ Scott Bixby â€
“
tonightâ€ ™ s live blog will feature contributions from Ben Jacobs and John Stoehr .
To catch up with todayâ€ ™ s political news before the town hall event , be sure to check out the Guardianâ€ ™ s minute - by - minute coverage of todayâ€ ™ s campaign events in our liveblog :"
2016-03-22,"Just hours after Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump launched high - profile attacks against one another on foreign policy , the standoff continued into the night in back - to - back interviews on CNNâ€ ™
s
The Final Five candidatesâ€ ™ forum .
The event featured interviews from all the remaining candidates in the 2016 election , but interviews with John Kasich and even Ted Cruz seemed like mere accents â€ “ distractions , even â€ “ in a larger , highly gendered standoff between Clinton and Trump that could foreshadow a general election in which the politics of sex and sexism is at the fore .
One thing Monday night made clear is if Trump and Clinton do indeed win their partiesâ€ ™ respective nominations , itâ€ ™ s going to be a long , bumpy , gender - politics - ridden ride .
So much of what Trump says can be read as sexual innuendo .
After Clinton suggested during a speech to Aipac on Monday that America needs â€œsteady hands , not a president who says heâ€ ™ s neutral on Monday , pro - Israel on Tuesday , and who - knows - what on Wednesday , â€ �
Trump took her criticism straight to a physical place .
â€œI have the steadiest hands .
Look at those hands , â€ � he said , raising a fist up to show the moderator .
Itâ€ ™ s an uncomfortable move given that Trump has already made his hands the topic of sexual innuendo once this campaign , after Marco Rubio ignominiously suggested Trumpâ€ ™ s small hands were indicative of another small appendage .
â€œLook at these hands .
Are they small hands?â€ �
Trump asked at a debate earlier this month , raising his hands up for the audience to see .
â€œHe referred to my hands , if theyâ€ ™ re small something else must be small .
I guarantee you
thereâ€
™ s
no problem.â€
�
Itâ€ ™ s a misstep , or at least a macho vulgarity , and Clinton may well have been baiting Trump to remind people of it in her phrasing of the criticism .
And whether the intention was there or not , she succeeded .
But when Trump makes such comments about his hands with respect to Clinton and her foreign policy prowess rather than with respect to another man , it may actually hurt him .
Because what translates as funny if immature dick jokes between men will read like pure sexism when itâ€ ™ s applied to Clinton .
It already reads that way when heâ€ ™ s lambasting Megyn Kelly , but of course she isnâ€ ™ t vying for the top job .
Still , public disdain of the way he speaks to Kelly may provide some insight .
Take the â€œsteady handsâ€ � moment :
Trump took Clintonâ€ ™ s argument about competence and made it about physicality .
And shortly after debuting his â€œsteadyâ€ � fist , he went on to suggest , more or less , that Clinton isnâ€ ™ t man enough to do the job â€ “ specifically as it pertains to foreign policy , where women leaders are famously thought to be in danger of being perceived as soft or weak .
He went on to make precisely that insinuation .
â€œHillary Clinton does not have the stamina , doesnâ€ ™ t have the energy , she doesnâ€ ™ t
have it .
Doesnâ€ ™ t have the strength to be president , â€ � he told his interviewer .
He also said that with her â€œitâ€ ™ s always dramaâ€
�
â€ “ be it Whitewater , or her much more recent email controversy .
Such attacks â€ “
that itâ€ ™ s â€œalways dramaâ€
� with her and that she â€œdoesnâ€ ™ t
have the strengthâ€ � for the job
â€ “ sound like what you might expect to hear a teenage boy say if he were facing off against a teenage girl the race for seventh - grade class president .
Itâ€ ™ s a familiar technique for Trump , who up until this point has employed schoolyard taunts to tremendous effect .
And Trump has seemed to get a lot of mileage for everything from teasing Jeb Bush for turning to his â€œmommyâ€ � , to calling Cruz a â€œpussyâ€ � and dubbing Rubio â€œlittle Marcoâ€ � .
But when it comes to sparring with a female opponent , machismo reads as sexism ( rather than homophobia ) .
At least , Clinton will do her best to push that narrative .
On Monday night , for instance , a moderator , citing recent public comments about Clintonâ€ ™ s tone of voice and propensity to smile following electoral victories , asked her whether she thought she was held to a double standard .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t hear anyone say that about men , and Iâ€ ™ ve seen a lot of male candidates who donâ€ ™ t smile very much and talk very loud , â€ � she offered .
But when asked about how sheâ€ ™ d campaign against Trump more directly , she took the high road .
â€œI intend to run a campaign about the real issues facing our country , â€ �
she said , arguing the election is like â€œa giant job interviewâ€ � .
What itâ€ ™ s about , she insisted , is â€œwho is steady , who is predictable , who gets
resultsâ€ � .
And just like that , as surely as Trump took the debate down to the level of physicality earlier in the night , Clinton took it back up to the cerebral .
And maybe , thatâ€ ™ s precisely what Clinton wanted to happen ."
2016-03-23,"For all of the unexpected turns 2016 has held for Republicans , one thing is certain : this year will be remembered as the election season that launched a thousand womenâ€ ™ s studies dissertations .
If â€œsmall handsâ€ � and â€œLittle Marcoâ€ �
didnâ€ ™ t convince you that the Republican presidential primary is actually a controlled study in anxious masculinity , Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have now gone full caveman : trading barbs over their wivesâ€ ™ honor .
( Sure , itâ€ ™ s a Twitter fight â€ “ not quite as testosterone - laden as an old - fashioned duel â€ “
but hey , itâ€ ™ s a new world . )
After an anti - Trump group ran Facebook ads in Utah ahead of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primary that featured a nearly - nude shot of Melania Trump , the blustery candidate accused Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign of being behind the picture .
â€œLyinâ€ ™ Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad .
Be careful , Lyinâ€ ™ Ted , or I will spill the beans on your wife!â€ �
Trump tweeted .
Cruz responded by tweeting to Trump that the picture did not come from him and that â€œif you try to attack Heidi , youâ€ ™ re more of a coward than I thought .
# classlessâ€ �
Sure , misogyny has been a staple of the Republicansâ€ ™ run this year , whether accusing women of menstruating while moderating or upholding a platform that would strip women of hard - won rights .
But this kind of one - upmanship is different than the Republicanâ€ ™ s everyday sexism .
Itâ€ ™ s
what psychologist and professor Stephen J Ducat calls â€œthe wimp factorâ€
�
â€ “ the way that American politics have long been shaped by menâ€ ™ s stark fear of being feminized .
The â€œwimp factorâ€ � is why Teddy Roosevelt once called Woodrow Wilson a â€œwhite - handy Miss Nancyâ€
� and why the Wall Street Journal ran a piece years ago
that declared â€œweâ€ ™ ve already had a woman president : Jimmy Carterâ€ � .
Fighting for oneâ€ ™ s masculine bonafides by using womenâ€ ™ s bodies as a proxy is also nothing new .
One of the most famous moments in American politics was when CNNâ€ ™ s Bernard Shaw asked Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Dukakis in 1988 whether he would support the death penalty if his wife was raped and murdered .
When Dukakis didnâ€ ™ t respond uproariously and angrily â€ “ instead answering from a policy perspective â€ “ his candidacy was considered dead in the water .
If he wasnâ€ ™ t willing to protect â€œhisâ€ � woman , how could he protect his country ?
â€œFor many men , masculinity is a hard - won , yet precarious and brittle psychological achievement that must be constantly proven and defended , â€ � Ducat has written .
And now that the Republican political climate is being framed by a candidate like Trump , who has literally turned the primary into a manhood - measuring contest , hyper - masculine posturing has become the most prevalent theme of the party .
Instead of having the desired effect of making the candidates seem strong , however , Republicansâ€ ™ antiquated chest - pounding comes across as more pathetic than powerful .
Itâ€ ™ s a political fight that isnâ€ ™ t based in confidence , but misogynist insecurity and weakness .
Iâ€ ™ m with Pulitzer prize winning columnist Connie Schultz , who responded that this is what happens â€œwhen both boys realize theyâ€ ™ re going to lose to a girlâ€ � .
Americans have bigger concerns than which candidate has the most noble or beautiful wife , or who has the biggest hands .
When the battle for the White House takes place in a locker room , everyone loses ."
2016-03-23,"The Republican party establishment seized on Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s convincing victory in Utah on Wednesday , as Jeb Bush endorsed the Texas senator and rallied other conservatives around the hope , however slim , that he could stop Donald Trump .
Cruz won an overwhelming majority in Mormon - heavy Utah on Tuesday , easily exceeding the 50 % threshold that , under the stateâ€ ™ s rules , secured him all 40 delegates .
â€œTo win , Republicans need to make this election about proposing solutions to the many challenges we face , and I believe that we should vote for Ted as he will do just that , â€ � Bush said in a statement .
There was a strong dose of wishful thinking , however , in the endorsement from the former governor of Florida , a candidate who dropped out of the presidential race after a string of disastrous performances .
Trump secured the largest delegate prize of Tuesday â€ “
the winner - takes - all state of Arizona â€ “ with 47 % of the vote to Cruzâ€ ™ s 45 % , in a state that is far larger and more representative of the wider country than Utah , which is dominated by a largely white and Mormon population .
The billionaire frontrunner remains comfortably on track to finish the Republican race with the most delegates , which would give him a mandate for the nomination , even if he falls short of the 1,237 delegates needed to win outright .
His opponents maintain the best way to block his nomination would be to first prevent him from securing the necessary tally of delegates , and that to do so they must coalesce around an alternative candidate at a brokered convention .
The Democratic results on Tuesday followed a similar pattern .
Frontrunner Hillary Clinton easily defeated Bernie Sanders in delegate - rich Arizona , while the Vermont senator registered resounding victories in Utah and Idaho , the latter of which was at stake only for Democrats on Tuesday .
Sandersâ€ ™ victory margins in Utah and Idaho , in which he secured close to 80 % of the vote , were by far the largest of the night , and are likely to energize his supporters , who maintain he still has a fighting chance of overcoming the former secretary of state .
The senator is also projected to perform well in the next three Democratic states to hold contests in a few days
â€ “ Alaska , Hawaii and Washington â€ “ and could end the month with a growing momentum .
But Sandersâ€ ™ path to the nomination remains steep , and would probably require a dramatic turnaround in the race .
The state he lost , Arizona , was the more significant contest in the Democratic race both because of its larger haul of delegates , and because its demographics could foreshadow voting trends in parts of neighbouring California , which holds its primary on 7 June .
The last state to vote in presidential nomination contests , California is usually an afterthought to campaigns .
But this year the stateâ€ ™ s delegate bonanza has the potential to play a decisive role in both the Democratic and Republican contests .
Clinton probably has less to fear than Trump , not least because the delegates she won in primaries and caucuses are bolstered by the support of party officials , who also get a say in the nomination process , unbound by state results , as so - called superdelegates .
They wonâ€ ™ t say it publicly , but Clintonâ€ ™ s top campaign officials are privately confident that on the current trajectory , Sanders will face intense pressure to pull out of the race before the July convention so that Clinton can turn to attacking her Republican opponent .
At her victory speech in Seattle on Tuesday , Clinton immediately positioned herself as the Democratic commander - in - chief in waiting , with a staunch critique of how her Republican rivals responded to the terrorist attacks in Brussels earlier in the day .
Trump , who recently suggested the US should reconsider its role in the Nato defense alliance
â€ “ a cornerstone of Washingtonâ€ ™
s
foreign policy for decades
â€ “ responded to the terrorist atrocity by repeating his call to waterboard terrorism suspects .
On Wednesday , he told ITVâ€ ™ s Good Morning Britain that Muslim communities were â€œabsolutely not reportingâ€ � terror suspects in their midst .
Cruz , meanwhile , has been widely criticized for reacting to the attacks with a call for law enforcement patrols of Muslim neighborhoods .
â€œIn the face of terror , America doesnâ€ ™ t panic , we donâ€ ™ t build walls or turn our backs on our allies , â€ � Clinton said during her address .
â€œWe
canâ€ ™ t throw out everything that we know about what works and what doesnâ€ ™ t and start torturing people.â€ �
She added : â€œWhat Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and others are suggesting is not only wrong , it is dangerous.â€ �
Widely disliked by his fellow senators of both parties , Cruz has mounted an improbable campaign to cast himself as the man who can unify the Republican party and defeat Trump .
That push is complicated by Ohio governor John Kasich , who has remained in the race despite winning only a single state , his own .
Bushâ€ ™ s
endorsement signals a shift in the tide , and adds pressure on Kasich to withdraw .
Bush said the party had to overcome â€œthe divisiveness and vulgarityâ€ � perpetuated by Trump .
The tenor of the race seems unlikely to change soon , if an election night Twitter squabble between Trump and Cruz is any indication .
On a night when world leaders were grappling with the repercussions of terrorist bombings in Brussels , Trump and Cruz trolled one another over their wives .
The businessman wrongly accused Cruz of being responsible for an ad in Utah , which used a nude photograph of Trumpâ€ ™ s wife from a magazine shoot 15 years ago .
â€œBe careful , Lyinâ€ ™ Ted , or I will spill the beans on your wife , â€ �
Trump wrote .
Cruz responded : â€œPic of your wife not from us .
Donald , if you try to attack Heidi , youâ€ ™ re more of a coward than I thought.â€ �"
2016-03-23,"As the geopolitical ramifications of terrorist attacks in Brussels came into focus , and as presidential candidates celebrated ( or cursed ) their results in last nightâ€ ™ s so - called â€œWestern Primariesâ€ � in Arizona , Utah and Idaho before setting their sights on upcoming contests in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest , we documented the highs and lows of the post - primary campaign .
Here are some of the key moments : Speaker of the house Paul Ryan told a group of congressional interns that although the state of American campaign politics seems grim , â€œit does not have to be this way ...
We donâ€ ™ t have to accept it and we donâ€ ™ t have to enable it.â€ �
He also apologized for accusing poor people on welfare of being â€œtakersâ€ � when he was on the Republican partyâ€ ™ s national ticket .
â€œThere was a time when I would talk about a difference between makers and takers in this country ...
I shouldnâ€ ™ t castigate a whole group of Americans just to make a point .
I say this not to be politically correct .
I say this because I was wrong.â€ �
In warning Donald Trump against attacking his wife Heidi , which Trump threatened to do on Twitter , Ted Cruz borrowed a line from the film The American President : Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has lambasted the long lines faced by would - be Arizona voters at polling places in the stateâ€ ™ s most populous county , calling reports of five - hour waits by prospective supporters â€œa disgrace.â€ � Hillary Clinton directly attacked her Republican rivalsâ€ ™ strategies to defeat the Islamic State , calling them â€œdangerousâ€ � in a speech on counterterrorism .
â€œIf
Mr Trump gets his way it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œTurning our back on our alliances or turning our alliance into a protection racket would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and would send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike.â€ �
Former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich reportedly boosted Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign when he met with more than 100 chiefs of staff for congressional Republicans in a closed - door meeting in Baltimore last week .

Mere hours after the bill was first debated in the North Carolina legislature , the stateâ€ ™ s Republican governor has pledged to sign sweeping legislation that voids all nondiscrimination ordinances for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people statewide .
The bill , in addition to rendering extent nondiscrimination ordinances null and void , also prevents local municipal governments from enacting any laws that regulate discrimination in employment or public accommodations .
The legislation also bar city governments from opening bathrooms for people to use based on the gender with which they identify .
Weâ€ ™ ll be back tomorrow , the next day , and every day until the election with on - the - ground reporting of up - to - the - minute campaign news .
Mere hours after the bill was first debated in the North Carolina legislature , the stateâ€ ™ s Republican governor has pledged to sign sweeping legislation that voids all nondiscrimination ordinances for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people statewide .
House Bill 2 was passed through the state legislature less than three hours after it was first introduced to the North Carolina House on Wednesday afternoon , in apparent response to a local ordinance passed in Charlotte that expanded nondiscrimination protections to the cityâ€ ™ s LGBT citizens .
Governor Pat McCrory had warned Charlotteâ€ ™ s city council that â€œchanging basic restroom and locker room norms ... [ and ] allowing a person with male anatomy , for example , to use a female restroom or locker room will most likely cause immediate State legislative intervention which I would support as governor.â€ �
Despite a walkout by Democrats in the state senate who protested that the bill was being forced through the legislature without proper review or debate - legislators were given five minutes to review the legislation before debate began - the bill was passed unanimously in the legislatureâ€ ™ s upper chamber .
The bill , in addition to rendering extent nondiscrimination ordinances null and void , also prevents local municipal governments from enacting any laws that regulate discrimination in employment or public accommodations .
The legislation also bar city governments from opening bathrooms for people to use based on the gender with which they identify .
Donald Trump has yet to respond to Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s challenge to debate him face - to - face on Bill Oâ€ ™ Reillyâ€ ™ s show on Fox News Channel - but the offer , according to the Cruz campaign , still stands .
Former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich has been coy about whether or not he plans to endorse one of the three remaining Republican presidential candidates , but on the heels of an interview with Slate that made his positive disposition towards billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump more than apparent , a report from The Daily Beast details how far the former presidential candidate is willing to go as a surrogate for the real estate tycoon .
According to the Daily Beast , Gingrich sang Trumpâ€ ™ s praises far and wide when he met with more than 100 chiefs of staff for congressional Republicans in a closed - door meeting in Baltimore last week .
â€œ[The ] guy who knows how to run Miss Universe , The Apprentice , Trump Towers , construction , golf courses , casinos , tiesâ€

â€œA guy who runs that every morning - you think he canâ€ ™ t run a presidential campaign?â€ �
The next quotation has become fodder for the internet already , for obvious reasons : â€œYou should study Trump and apply it to your member , â€ �

Technically , this is cross - border political news , but ...
Rob Ford , the late mayor of Toronto who admitted to smoking crack while in office and was caught on camera threatening to kill a rival , will lie in repose for two days at City Hall before he is buried next week .
Hillary Clinton has called out Donald Trump and Ted Cruz by name , accusing the two leading Republican presidential candidates of pushing national security agendas that would embolden American adversaries at home and abroad .
Speaking at Stanford University , Clinton tried to walk a fine line of promising to be more engaged in foreign affairs than some of her rivals while pledging that US ground troops should not be dragged into more wars .
Her speech came just a day after Trump and Cruz called for a crackdown on Muslims in the wake of a terrorist attacks in Belgium .
At one point Clinton took Trump to task for his insistence that the US should be less involved , or at least invest less money , in Nato .
â€œIf
Mr Trump gets his way it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œTurning our back on our alliances or turning our alliance into a protection racket would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and would send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike.â€ �
Clinton also took direct aim at Cruz , who has called for more police to â€œpatrol and secureâ€ � Muslim neighborhoods .
The US president hoped to display a â€˜new eraâ€ ™ for relations at an exhibition game , but terror attacks in Brussels earlier in the day left him facing a difficult challenge , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Amber Jamieson .
On Tuesday , during the first trip to Cuba by a US president since 1928 , Barack Obama and the Cuban president , RaÃºl Castro , attended a friendly exhibition baseball game .
Terror attacks in Brussels earlier that day , however , left the president facing a difficult challenge : how can the White House present a historic and long - planned celebration at a moment of dire international crisis ?
The baseball game , between the Tampa Bay Rays and Cubaâ€ ™ s national team , was months in the planning and its symbolism plain to citizens of both countries â€ “ the last time an MLB team played in Cuba was 1999 , when Fidel Castro was still president .
This was the chance for Obama and Castroâ€ ™ s successor to sit down in public together , surrounded by thousands of everyday Cubans , and show the world what Obama has hailed as â€œa new eraâ€ � of the Americas .
The White House tried to anticipate the image problem â€ “ Obama laughing with Castro about baseball while world leaders spoke of a war on western values â€ “ by releasing a photo on Tuesday morning of the president at his most intense .
Celebrities and tech executives were among the top donors around the country to the Baltimore mayoral bid of Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson .
But the candidate is still polling at less than 1 % in a race against more than a dozen other candidates .
Actors Susan Sarandon and Rashida Jones contributed $ 500 and $ 2,500 respectively .
Executives from companies including Twitter , Netflix and Slack made donations of the $ 6,000 legal limit , according to campaign finance reportsfiled Tuesday .
In all , McKesson received contributions totaling more than $ 222,000 from close to 5,000 individual donors in every state in the US , reflecting the national support for a candidate with broad name recognition and a major national social media following .
But that national clout and celebrity support has not yet translated into local momentum , in a city where as much as 30 % of the population does not have regular internet access .
McKessonâ€ ™
s campaign has spent $ 127,523.47 , leaving just over $ 97,000 in the war chest for the cityâ€ ™ s hotly contested Democratic mayoral primary â€ “ which has traditionally determined the winner in the general election in this deeply Democratic city .
Senator Ted Cruz on Tuesday proposed reinstating an intrusive and controversial surveillance program that targeted Muslim neighborhoods in New York after the September 11 terrorists attacks .
Elaborating on his call to â€œpatrol and secure Muslim
neighborhoodsâ€
�
, Cruz said he would replicate the law enforcement policies of the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg that allowed NYPD detectives to eavesdrop on Muslim Americans .
â€œIf you look here in the city of New York , New York had a proactive policing program that Mayor Michael Bloomberg championed to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization , â€ � Cruz said .
The programs in question were stopped in 2014 and have been the subject of a string of lawsuits , drawing criticism from civil rights groups and even some security experts who argued that they sowed mistrust between law enforcement and Muslim American communities .
Cruz called the program â€œsuccessfulâ€ � and lambasted the New York mayor for having â€œsuccumbed to unfounded criticismsâ€ � when he disbanded it .
John Kasich has only won a single primary in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination - and it was his home state of Ohio - which has led prominent members of his party , including fellow candidate Ted Cruz , to decry his candidacy as a spoiler that will throw the nomination to Donald Trump .
But a new poll from Bloomberg Politics shows that in hypothetical head - to - head general election matchups between each of the remaining Republican candidates and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , Kasich is the only one who comes out ahead .
In a hypothetical race against Clinton , Kasich wins 47 % to Clintonâ€ ™ s 43 % ( with 11 % undecided , to be fair ) .
In contrast , both Trump and Cruz fall behind Clinton ( 36 % to 54 % and 42 % to 51 % , respectively ) .
In an in - depth interview with Slate , former speaker of the house and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich came within inches of saying that he supports Republican frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential candidacy , dismissing criticism of the billionaireâ€ ™ s immigration policy and Nato platform as â€œliberal tripe.â€ � â€œYou are talking about a guy who was smart enough to build Trump Towers , build lots of hotels , build lots of casinos , and own the Miss Universe contest , â€ �
Gingrich said .
â€œHe is not stupid .
For many people , that seems to be inconceivable because they have a university Ph.D. theory of being smart.â€
�
The entire interview is worth a read , but this might be the most telling nugget : What we know is that Trump has had the nerve to raise questions in a clear language because he represents the millions of Americans who are sick and tired of being told that they have to be guilt - ridden and keep their mouth shut .
Former Florida governor and long - gone Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has dropped a line to his supports , encouraging them via email to fundraise and volunteer for one - time foe Ted Cruz .
â€œTed is a consistent , principled conservative who has demonstrated the ability to appeal to voters and win primary contests , â€ � Bush writes .
â€œFor the sake of our party and country , we must overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity Donald Trump has brought into the political arena or we will certainly lose our chance to defeat the Democratic nominee , most likely Hillary Clinton ,
this fall.â€ � Bush finishes the latter by telling his former supporters that â€œI hope you will join me in supporting Tedâ€ ™ s campaign by ... contributing and volunteering.â€ � Donald Trump , the Republican frontrunner , showed his characteristic restraint in responding to Bushâ€ ™ s
endorsement : Barack Obama has declared wiping out Islamic State his â€œtop priorityâ€ � as his secretary of state , John Kerry , prepared to visit Brussels in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks that killed 31 people and wounded 270 .
Speaking during a visit to Argentina , the US president called for countries around the world to unite against Isis , which claimed responsibility for the attacks at Brussels airport and a metro station .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve got a lot of things on my plate , but my top priority is to defeat Isil and to eliminate the scourge of this barbaric terrorism thatâ€ ™ s been taking place around the world , â€ � Obama , using an alternative acronym for the group , told reporters .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no more important item on my agenda than going after them and defeating them .
The issue is , how do we do it in an intelligent way?â€ � Hillary Clinton directly attacked her Republican rivalsâ€ ™ strategies to defeat the Islamic State , calling them â€œdangerousâ€ � in a speech on counterterrorism .
In her speech at Stanford University , Clinton singled out Donald Trump , who has called for banning Muslims from entering the US , and Ted Cruz , who proposed patrolling Muslim neighborhoods .
She called Cruzâ€ ™ s proposal â€œwrong and counterproductive .
Itâ€ ™ s dangerous.â€
�
She also noted Trumpâ€ ™ s seemingly cozy relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin , and criticized Trump for suggesting the US should re - negotiate its terms of involvement with NATO .
â€œIf
Mr. Trump gets his way , itâ€ ™ ll be like Christmas in the Kremlin.â€ � â€œIn our fight against radical jihadism , we have to do what actually works .
What doesnâ€ ™ t work : offensive rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims , â€ � Clinton said .
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has lambasted the long lines faced by would - be Arizona voters at polling places in the stateâ€ ™ s most populous county , calling reports of five - hour waits by prospective supporters â€œa disgrace.â€ � â€œPeople in the United States of America should not have to wait five hours in order to vote , â€ � Sanders said during a press conference in San Diego , California .
â€œWe do not know how many thousands of people who wanted to vote yesterday in Arizona did not vote.â€
�
The long lines were the result of a cost - cutting decision by Maricopa County - which includes Phoenix , the sixth - largest city in the county - to reduce the number of polling places from more than 200 during the 2012 election to a mere 60 for this yearâ€ ™ s primary .
According to the Arizona Republic , there were more than 21,000 voters in Maricopa County for every polling station , leading to long lines that forced some voters to wait until past midnight to cast their ballots in person .
Sanders lost Arizonaâ€ ™ s presidential primary last night by nearly twenty points .
Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have gone full caveman , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Jessica Valenti : For all of the unexpected turns 2016 has held for Republicans , one thing is certain : this year will be remembered as the election season that launched a thousand womenâ€ ™ s studies dissertations .
If â€œsmall handsâ€ � and â€œLittle Marcoâ€ �
didnâ€ ™ t convince you that the Republican presidential primary is actually a controlled study in anxious masculinity , Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have now gone full caveman - trading barbs over their wivesâ€ ™ honor .
( Sure , itâ€ ™ s a Twitter fight â€ “ not quite as testosterone - laden as an old - fashioned duel â€ “
but hey , itâ€ ™ s a new world . )
After an anti - Trump group ran Facebook ads in Utah ahead of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primarythat featured a nearly - nude shot of Melania Trump , the blustery candidate accused Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign of being behind the picture .
â€œLyinâ€ ™ Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad .
Be careful , Lyinâ€ ™ Ted , or I will spill the beans on your wife!â€ �
Trump tweeted .
Cruz responded by tweeting to Trumpthat the picture did not come from him and that â€œif you try to attack Heidi , youâ€ ™ re more of a coward than I thought .
# classlessâ€ �
Sure , misogyny has been a staple of the Republicansâ€ ™ run this year
â€ “ whether accusing women of menstruating while moderating or upholding a platform that would strip women of hard - won rights â€ “
but this kind of one - upmanship is different than the Republicanâ€ ™ s everyday sexism .
Would you rather be shot or poisoned ?
was how senator Lindsey Graham put it .
But then he hosted a fundraiser for Cruz â€ “ so maybe itâ€ ™ s not such an intractable conundrum .
In warning Donald Trump against attacking his wife Heidi , which Trump threatened to do on Twitter , Ted Cruz borrowed a line from the film The American President : Paul Ryan on ugly political discourse : â€˜It didnâ€ ™ t use to be this badâ€ ™ â€ “ video Hillary Clinton will train her fire on Republicansâ€ ™ â€œrhetorical blusterâ€ � during a speech on counterterrorism at Stanford this afternoon , one day after the attacks in Brussels .
Clinton will argue that the US must be â€œnimble and comprehensiveâ€ � in its efforts to defeat ISIS , according to a campaign official , and she will call for strengthening international alliances , specifically NATO .
Clinton is expected to target Republicansâ€ ™ responses to the Brussels attacks .
On Tuesday , Ted Cruz called for patrolling Muslim neighborhoods , while Donald Trump reiterated his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country .
Ted Cruz is in New York City today â€ “ and uses the occasion to attack two hometown boys and the former senator from the state , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino from the scene in midtown : CNN notices that Trump appears to have a light week scheduled .
In any case thereâ€ ™ s not much Republican voting going on before a stack of states on 26 April .
Wisconsin votes on 5 April , Colorado votes on 8 April and New York votes on 19 April .
President Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s decision Tuesday to carry on with his Cuba trip instead of returning to the United States in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in Brussels was criticized by all three Republican presidential candidates and others who questioned whether Obama could help coordinate an international response to the attacks from the Estado Latinoamerico in Havana .
Obama attended an exhibition baseball game Tuesday afternoon in Cuba as key aspects of the attacks â€ “ from the casualty count to the suspectsâ€ ™ names to links to the November Paris attackers to a claim of responsibility by the Islamic State â€ “ were emerging or had freshly emerged .
Obama also addressed Cuban officials and dignitaries at Havanaâ€ ™ s Gran Teatro on Tuesday .
The speech , in which the president called for free speech for political dissidents , was broadcast in Cuba and internationally .
Multiple European countries announced new border controls , meanwhile , as Belgian authorities and Nato allies worked with US officials to organize a response to the attacks .
Obama should have been there , too , said Ohio governor John Kasich .
â€œWhat I hope he will say is , heâ€ ™ s leaving Cuba and heading back to the White House , â€ �
Kasich told Fox News .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s gon na begin to organize meetings with the leaders around the world and at the same time get himself in the position of where we can send teams of people immediately to Europe to begin to dig in terms of what we need to do to address the vulnerabilities we have.â€
�
Obama addressed the criticism in an interview with ESPN during the baseball game .
â€œItâ€ ™ s always a challenge when you have a terrorist attack anywhere in the world , particularly in this age of 24/7 news coverage , â€ � Obama said .
â€œYou want to be respectful and understand the gravity of the situation , but the whole premise of terrorism is to try to disrupt peopleâ€ ™ s ordinary lives.â€ �
The White House released a photo of Obama and national security adviser Susan Rice taking a call about the attacks at the residence of the US chief of mission in Havana : Ted Cruz , who on Monday hit Obama for complying with a photo opportunity in Cuba that featured in the background a large mural of Che Guevara , said Tuesday that Obama should either return from Cuba or travel himself to Brussels : â€œPresident Obama is spending his time going to baseball games with the Castros ,
â€ �
Cruz , the Cuban - American son of a Cuban refugee father , said .
â€œThe American people deserve a president who doesnâ€ ™ t grovel before a communist dictator who hates America , â€ � Cruz said .
Trump also got in on the act :
Hi , weâ€ ™ d omitted to enable comments on the blog .
Weâ€ ™ ve enabled them now .
Sorry about that .
No wonder no one was answering our callout to predict what Paul Ryan would say in his speech .
Thanks for reading and participating !
Ryan said â€œit did not use to be this wayâ€ � and asserted it does not have to be this way .
But is he a general without an army ?
Donald Trump has won 20 states .
Ryan is asked whose job it is to improve political discourse .
â€œSometimes today
we see a politics that is degrading , a politics that goes to our base , â€ � Ryan says .
Leaders , we need to raise our gaze , and raise our game , and talk about ideas , not prey upon people in their separate identities .
[ ... ] People must accept that other people think differently , he says .
â€œEvery one of our jobs as citizens is to respect other peopleâ€ ™ s different opinions .. without impugning their motives.â€ �
Ryan says heâ€ ™ s not going to name names .
But â€œwe are slipping into being a divisive country .
We are speaking to each other in echo chambers.â€ �
Politics can be a battle of ideas , not a battle of insults .
It can be about solutions .
It can be about making a difference . ..
Thatâ€ ™ s what it can be , and thatâ€ ™ s what it should be .
Heâ€ ™ s done .
Brief speech .
A call for civility in politics .
Heâ€ ™ s going to take questions .
Ryan moves into a sketch of contrasts between what the national politics is and what it could be .
Thereâ€ ™ s an implicit criticism throughout of the avatars of national political nastiness .
Whomever he means by that .
â€œInstead of playing to your anxieties
, we can appeal to your aspirations , â€ � Ryan says .
He says that playing identity politics is wrong .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t just resort to scaring you , we dare to inspire you , â€ � in his ideal politics , Ryan says .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t
just oppose , we propose ...
We donâ€ ™ t
just win your support , we win the argument , we win hearts and minds.â€
�
Then Ryan gets personal , referring to a mistake heâ€
™ s admitted before , in previously dividing Americans between makers and takers .
â€œThere was a time when I would talk about a difference between makers and takers in this country ...
I realized that I was wrong ...
most people donâ€ ™ t want to be dependent , and to label a whole group of Americans that way was wrong .
I
shouldnâ€
™ t castigate a whole group of Americans just to make a point .
â€œI say this not to be politically correct .
I say this because I was wrong.â€
�
â€œThe way we govern endures , through debate and not disorder , â€ � Ryan says .
He is paying tribute to the storied institutions of government and the rules that guide them .
He says they make the country unique .
The in - room audience for the speech comprises Capitol Hill interns .
So Ryan has shifted to an inspirational call to passion and ideas and vocations in government .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what politics can be .
Thatâ€ ™ s what our country can be ....
it sounds like a long way from where we are right now , doesnâ€ ™ t it?â€
�
We donâ€ ™ t have to accept it and we donâ€ ™ t have to enable it , Ryan says , of lowdown political discourse .
He says he wants to talk about a brighter vision for the national politics .
â€œDonâ€
™ t forget to go vote , â€ � he says .
But he doesnâ€
™ t mean in the presidential election .
There are votes on the House floor this morning .
Heâ€
™ s speaking in the ways and means ( taxes ) committee room .
He says the setting is symbolic .
Everyone on the committee , when he was on it , â€œtook our jobs very seriouslyâ€ �
â€ “
but they held themselves to a higher standard of decorum , he says .
A bygone standard , he implies .
â€œWe disagreed without being disagreeable ...
It almost sounds like Iâ€ ™ m speaking of a different time .
â€œIt is so easy to get disheartened .
..
â€œOur political discourse , on TV [ and among each other ]
.. It did not use to be this bad , and it does not have to be this way.â€ �
Fodder for the Kremlinologists : Is it a bigger deal for Jeb Bush to endorse Ted Cruz for president â€ “ or for Ted Cruz to follow Jeb Bush on Twitter ?
How significant was this historic follow ?
Yesterday House speaker Paul Ryan announced that he wanted to share his thought on â€œthe state of American politics.â€ �
His staff has said that he did not plan to make an endorsement in the presidential race and certainly did not plan to express any personal designs on the White House .
You can watch video of the event below , when it starts ( scheduled for 11 am ET ) .
What do you think heâ€ ™ ll say ?
That thereâ€ ™ s too much incivility in American politics and while he understands frustration with Washington he fears that conservatives have strayed from core principles ?
After Islamic State - linked attacks in Brussels Tuesday that killed dozens , Texas senator Ted Cruz cast suspicion on Muslim Americans .
â€œWe need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized , â€ �
Cruz said in a statement posted on Tuesday to Facebook , adding : â€œThe days of the United States voluntarily surrendering to the enemy to show how progressive and enlightened we can be are at an end.â€ �
Challenged by ABC News Wednesday morning on how targeting
Muslim communities was constitutional , Cruz sidestepped : What we should be targeting is radical Islamic terrorism .
The political correctness of this administration , they refuse to acknowledge that we are facing a global jihad from radical Islamic terrorism .
Hereâ€ ™ s video : Ted Cruz responded last night to Trumpâ€ ™ s Twitter threat to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on his
, Cruzâ€ ™ s , wife .
Hereâ€ ™ s some background for the wife - bashing that has broken out in the Republican race .
On the eve of voting in Utah , an anti - Trump super PAC made a couple Facebook ads meant to persuade Mormon voters , among others , that Trump was the wrong candidate for them .
The ads â€ “ cheapo photoshop stills , not video â€ “ attacked Trump on two fronts .
One , he used to be pro choice , to believe his own words .
Two , his wife , former Slovenian model Melania , once posed naked , to believe your own eyes .
The ad about Melania Trump features the naked picture .
â€œMeet
Melania Trump , your next first lady , â€ � it reads .
â€œOr , you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.â€
� Prompting Trump to tweet his threat .
The end ?
The John Kasich camp is not impressed with Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s endorsement of Ted Cruz : â€œIf he were a kingmaker , heâ€ ™ d be the king.â€
�
True .
But what if both Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham get behind a candidate ?
Clinton and Trump win big in Arizona primaries
â€ “ video Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Mother - was - right presidential candidate Jeb Bush has endorsed Texas senator Ted Cruz for president , arguing that Cruz has the best chance of beating Democrats in the general election .
â€œTo win , Republicans need to make this election about proposing solutions to the many challenges we face , and I believe that we should vote for Ted as he will do just that , â€ � a Bush statement said .
Republican voters must overcome â€œthe divisiveness and vulgarityâ€ � that Donald Trump had brought into the political arena â€œor we will certainly lose our chance to defeat the Democratic nominee and reverse President Obamaâ€ ™ s failed policiesâ€ � , Bush said .
Divisiveness ?
Vulgarity ?
What is he talking about ?
Trump , meanwhile , has moved closer to cinching the Republican nomination , notching a big 47%-25 % win over Cruz last night in Arizona
( Ohio governor John Kasich came in third with 10 % ) .
Cruz stayed in range by sweeping delegates in Utah with an authoritative 68%-17 % victory over Kasich .
Trump came third .
Hereâ€ ™ s the state of the Republican delegate race : On the Democratic side , Bernie Sanders turned in two skyscraper wins â€ “ weâ€ ™ re talking 80 % territory â€ “ in Utah and Idaho .
As Sanders supporters are very tired of hearing , however , his wins did not propel him forward much in the delegates race , owing to a robust 58%-40 % victory for Hillary Clinton in Arizona .
With last returns still arriving , he appeared to have posted a net gain of six delegates .
Hereâ€ ™ s the delegates race on the Democratic side : See full , county - by - county results from last nightâ€ ™ s voting here : Does Trump just mean this ?"
2016-03-23,"In the first substantive policy proposal by a presidential candidate since the attacks in Brussels on Tuesday , Senator Ted Cruz proposed reinstating an intrusive and controversial surveillance program that targeted Muslim neighborhoods in New York after the September 11 terrorists attacks .
Elaborating on his call to â€œpatrol and secure Muslim
neighborhoodsâ€
�
, Cruz said he would replicate the law enforcement policies of the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg that allowed NYPD detectives to eavesdrop on Muslim Americans .
â€œIf you look here in the city of New York , New York had a proactive policing program that Mayor Michael Bloomberg championed to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization , â€ � Cruz said .
After a series of blasts left more than 30 dead and 250 wounded in the Belgian capital , the 2016 presidential candidates issued statements and appeared on cable news shows to express solidarity with the people of Europe and to outline their counter - terrorism proposals , highlighting the similarities among the Democratic candidates while exposing real differences among the three Republicans .
On Tuesday , Trump reprised his call to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the US , which his Republican rivals have condemned , and suggested that harsh interrogation techniques , including torture , might have prevented the Brussels attacks .
Cruz , meanwhile , called for the US to â€œempower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalizedâ€ � .
He added : â€œThe days of the United States voluntarily surrendering to the enemy to show how progressive and enlightened we can be are at an end.â€ � Republican presidential candidate John Kasich said Cruzâ€ ™ s proposal would lead to more â€œpolarizationâ€ � and create â€œdivisionsâ€ � â€ ™ in American society .
Hillary Clinton , the Democratic frontrunner , and Bernie Sanders called for strengthening information sharing with European allies and standing in solidarity with the people of Belgium .
On Wednesday , Clinton is expected to expand on her counter - terrorism agenda during a speech at Stanford University .
On Tuesday , Cruz compared his plan to prevent radicalization and homegrown terror to cracking down on gang violence .
â€œIt is standard law enforcement
â€ “
it is good law enforcement to focus on where threats are emanating from ,
â€ �
he told reporters during a press conference in New York .
Cruz also accused the current New York mayor , Bill de Blasio , of abolishing Bloombergâ€ ™ s surveillance policies â€œin a pique of political correctnessâ€ � .
The Texas senator railed against politicians who he believes are wrongly concerned with offending certain groups , declaring that â€œpolitical correctness costs livesâ€ � .
The mayorâ€ ™ s office called the characterization of De Blasio â€œblatantly falseâ€ � .
â€œNow we know why everyone is calling Ted Cruz a liar , â€ � said Monica Klein , a spokeswoman for the mayor , in reference to Trumpâ€ ™ s preferred moniker for his Republican rival , â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � .
The NYPD also responded in force : â€œThe statement [ Ted Cruz ] made today is why he wonâ€ ™ t become president of this country , â€ � the NYPD commissioner , Bill Bratton , said on Tuesday .
The programs , which were stopped in 2014 and have been the subject of a string of lawsuits , drew criticism from civil rights groups and even some security experts who argued that they sowed mistrust between law enforcement and Muslim American communities .
Cruz called the program â€œsuccessfulâ€ � and lambasted the New York mayor for having â€œsuccumbed to unfounded criticismsâ€ � when he disbanded it .
Cruz also criticized President Obama for attending a baseball game in Cuba on Tuesday instead of returning home to address the attacks .
â€œIndeed today , President Obama is happily at a baseball game yucking it up with the Castros , communist dictators , rather than being in America and directing the effort to defeat Isis , â€ � said Cruz , whose father is Cuban ."
2016-03-23,"Donald Trump has threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on the wife of Ted Cruz , prompting a war of words on social media with his rival for the Republican nomination The tweet , which threatened Cruz and his wife over a Facebook ad run by an anti - Trump Super Pac unrelated to the Texas senator , came minutes before the Arizona polls closed on Tuesday .
Trump referred to the attack ad that featured a nude picture of a Trumpâ€ ™ s now - wife , Melania , from a photoshoot for GQ in 2000 .
The frontrunnerâ€ ™ s wife is lying on her front , so the image does not show her fully naked .
The ad , which was targeted at female members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Utah , had a caption suggesting voters back Cruz lest Melania Trump become the next first lady .
â€œMeet Melania Trump .
Your Next First Lady , â€ � it said .
â€œOr , You Could Support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.â€
�
The image is widely available on the internet , and can be viewed here .
Trump claimed the ad , distributed only in Utah where anti - Trump forces were hoping that Cruz reach the 50 % threshold needed for him to win all the stateâ€ ™ s delegates , was a personal attack from the Texas senator .
Cruz quickly posted a response on Twitter writing : â€œPic of your wife not from us .
Donald , if you try to attack Heidi , youâ€ ™ re more of a coward than I thought .
# classless ?
The dispute between the two men erupted shortly before polls closed in the Arizona primary and bore all of the hallmarks of the kind of viral controversy the Republican frontrunner has repeatedly has stoked in search of publicity .
Earlier Trump had suffered from an off - key response to the massive terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday .
The attacks came just one day after the Republican frontrunner called for the US to play a significantly smaller role in Nato , which is headquartered in Brussels and also flip - flopped yet again on sending ground troops to fight Isis .
In response to the attack , Trump reaffirmed his support for torture and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States while standing by his skepticism of Nato ."
2016-03-23,"Hillary Clinton called out Donald Trump and Ted Cruz by name , accusing the two leading Republican presidential candidates of pushing national security agendas that would embolden American adversaries at home and abroad .
Speaking at Stanford University on Wednesday in front of some leading foreign policy thinkers â€ “ including Ronald Reaganâ€ ™ s former secretary of state , George Shultz , and the current one , John Kerry â€ “ Clinton tried to walk a fine line of promising to be more engaged in foreign affairs than some of her rivals while pledging that US ground troops should not be dragged into more wars .
Her speech came just a day after Trump and Cruz called for a crackdown on Muslims in the wake of a terrorist attacks in Belgium .
At one point Clinton took Trump to task for his insistence that the US should be less involved , or at least invest less money , in Nato .
â€œIf
Mr Trump gets his way it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œTurning our back on our alliances or turning our alliance into a protection racket would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and would send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike.â€ �
Clinton also took direct aim at Cruz , who has called for more police to â€œpatrol and secureâ€ � Muslim neighborhoods .
â€œWhen Republican candidates like Ted Cruz call for treating American Muslims like criminals and for racially profiling predominantly Muslim neighborhoods , itâ€ ™ s wrong , itâ€ ™ s counterproductive , itâ€ ™ s dangerous , â€ � Clinton said .
The former secretary of state said that such inflammatory rhetoric will only serve to alienate all Muslims , whom the US needs to help identify signs of radicalization at home .
Hours earlier , at a rally in New York , Cruz repeated his controversial proposal to â€œsecure and patrolâ€ �
Muslim neighborhoods despite facing widespread and swift criticism for his knee - jerk reaction to the terror attacks in Brussels .
New York police commissioner Bill Bratton had sharply criticized the proposal , telling CBS This Morning : â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t know what the hell
heâ€
™ s talking about , to be frank with you.â€ �
The Texas senator also continued an increasingly ugly feud with Trump that has brought the level of presidential - year debate to a new low as the men exchange insults about one anotherâ€ ™ s wives .
â€œLyinâ€ ™ Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from G.Q. shoot in his ad , â€ �
Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday .
â€œBe careful , Lyinâ€ ™ Ted , or I will spill the beans on your wife!â€
�
Trump was referencing an advertisement created by the Super Pac â€œMake America Awesomeâ€ � , which shows Melania Trump , a former model from Slovenia , posing nude on a fur rug .
The ad , which targeted Utahâ€ ™ s Mormon voters , said : â€œMeet Melania Trump .
Your next first lady .
Or , you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.â€
�
Cruz fired back on Twitter : â€œPic of your wife not from us .
Donald , if you try to attack Heidi , youâ€ ™ re more of a coward than I thought .
# classless.â€
�
During his New York news conference , Cruz called Trumpâ€ ™ s threat
â€œgutter politicsâ€ � while distancing himself from the ad , which he called â€œcompletely inappropriateâ€ � .
He said his campaign had â€œno involvementâ€ � in creating the ad .
â€œDonaldâ€ ™ s not comfortable addressing foreign policy in the wake of a terrorist attack .
Donald doesnâ€ ™ t know what to do to deal with Isis
so he goes back to his comfort zone , and his comfort zone is insults and attacks and bullying ,
â€ �
Cruz said , speaking at the Womenâ€ ™ s National Republican Club in Midtown .
He added later that his wife Heidi , who used to work at Goldman Sachs , is not intimidated in the least .
â€œShe is used to dealing with bullies , and Donald Trump doesnâ€
™ t scare Heidi remotely .
â€
¦
But the fact that Donald is attacking Heidi says a lot about his character , â€ � Cruz said .
The clash has left senior Republicans once again agonizing in public .
In Washington , Republican House speaker Paul Ryan condemned divisiveness in American politics , including a veiled rebuke to Republican frontrunner Trump and the â€œdegradingâ€ � tone of the presidential race .
The former vice - presidential candidate has been touted by some as a potential savior of the party if Trump fails to win the nomination outright and an unresolved race goes all the way to a contested convention .
The grand title of his speech , â€œSpeaker Ryan on the State of American Politicsâ€ � , and its statesman - like call for unity with reference to the founding fathers against a backdrop of US flags , might reinforce that view in some quarters .
While Ryan has ruled himself out of a dramatic late bid for the White House , his question - and - answer session with Capitol Hill interns suggested a man with his eye on a higher purpose .
â€œSometimes today we see a politics that is degrading , a politics
thatâ€ ™ s going to the base , the bases of our emotions , of what disunifies us , not what unifies us , â€ � he said .
â€œSo hereâ€ ™ s our job as leaders : we need to raise our gaze and we need to raise our game and talk about ideas , try to unite us , not prey on peopleâ€ ™ s separations or their identities.â€ �
Ryan told of his concern that politics has drifted away from debates over ideas and attempts to unify the country and is now debased by personal insults and toxic rhetoric .
â€œWe are slipping into being a divisive country , â€ � he warned .
â€œWe are speaking to each other in echo chambers where we only talk to those who agree with us , and we think that there is something wrong with people who donâ€ ™ t agree with us .
â€œWe question and impugn motives instead of test the original thesis .
That is where it doesnâ€ ™ t need to be , where it wasnâ€ ™ t and where it shouldnâ€ ™ t be .
So the whole point I would make is if we are going to keep this beautiful American experience going , weâ€ ™ re going to have to stay unified as a country.â€ � Ryan , 46 , made his appeal amid an extraordinary campaign that has seen insults traded on the debate stage and comments made about the size of Trumpâ€ ™ s hands and private parts .
Mitt Romney , the Republican nominee four years ago , has declared Trump unfit for office and vowed to stop him .
Ryan , who was his running mate , has said he will support whoever the nominee is .
He did not mention any candidate by name on Wednesday .
But he said : â€œWhat really bothers me the most about politics is this notion of identity politics , that weâ€ ™ re going to win an election by dividing people , that weâ€ ™ re going to win an election by talking to people in ways that divide them and separate them from other people , rather than inspiring people on our common humanity , on our common ideals , on our common culture , on the things that should unify us.â€ � Calling for greater civility in political life , the Republican from Wisconsin added : â€œIf someone has a bad idea , we donâ€
™ t think theyâ€ ™ re a bad person .
People with different ideas , theyâ€ ™ re not traitors , theyâ€ ™ re not our enemies ; theyâ€ ™ re our neighbors , theyâ€ ™ re our co - workers , theyâ€ ™ re our fellow citizens .
Sometimes theyâ€ ™ re our friends .
Sometimes theyâ€ ™ re even our own flesh and blood .
â€œWhen passions flare , ugliness is sometimes inevitable , but we shouldnâ€ ™ t accept ugliness as the norm .
We should demand better from ourselves , we should demand better from one another .
We should think about the great leaders that have bestowed upon us the great opportunity to live the American idea .
We should honor their legacy.â€ � Clinton , meanwhile , was seeking to play up what she sees as one of her key assets over Republicans in a general election : her experience as Americaâ€ ™ s top diplomat .
Her rivals , she reasoned , donâ€ ™ t have the temperament to deal with delicate international negotiations .
At the same time , she tried to preempt arguments that she is too ready to intervene in foreign conflicts .
She said she wouldnâ€ ™ t â€œstumble into another costly ground war in the Middle Eastâ€ � and added that â€œpeople and nations have to secure their own communitiesâ€ � .
There was one issue on which Clinton wasnâ€ ™ t willing to take a position :
Appleâ€ ™ s recent fight with the FBI .
She instead argued the two sides need to â€œstop seeing each other as adversaries and start working togetherâ€ � .
The FBI may have ended its legal showdown with Americaâ€ ™ s most valuable company after it acquired classified technology to help it download data from the locked iPhone of San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook .
Clinton warned this likely only kicks the can down the road on the debate .
â€œThe FBI may have found a workaround , â€ �
she said .
â€œBut there will be future cases with different facts and different challenges.â€ �
She also called on Silicon Valley to do more to track suspected terrorists using social media platforms .
The US , she said , needs to be â€œwaging online battles with extremists to discredit their ideology , expose their lies and counter their idealsâ€ � ."
2016-03-23,"The results are in for Arizona , Utah and Idaho after a long night of elections in the west .
Frontrunners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton won key victories in the Arizona primary , bringing them both closer to the general election fight .
But challengers Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders scored notable caucus wins in Utah , and the Vermont senator also nabbed a victory in the Idaho Democratic caucus ( the GOP caucus , which happened at an earlier date , went to Cruz ) .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned :
Mormons donâ€ ™ t like Trump as the huge loss in Utah and earlier loss in Idaho both clearly demonstrate .
Utah could go blue for the first time in 50 years in part because the Mormons who backed Ted Cruz may choose Clinton over Trump in November .
Despite his frontrunner status , Trump faces a long uphill battle to acquire the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination .
Sanders needs big upsets in the Democratic caucuses in Alaska , Hawaii and Washington this month to make a notable dent in Clintonâ€ ™ s lead .
Ohio governor John Kasichâ€ ™ s decision to remain in the race remains a problem for Cruz as the â€œanyone - but - Trumpâ€ � GOP crowd continues to divide their money and support between the two .
Trump thinks itâ€ ™ s a good tactic to attack Cruzâ€ ™ s wife , threatening on Twitter to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on her - yet another insult previously unthinkable in a presidential race .
Cruz thinks that the US should secure and patrol Muslim neighborhoods to fight terrorism and Trump agrees itâ€ ™ s a good proposal ( Kasich does not ) .
Controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio is toying with the possibility of a role in a Trump administration .
After remaining largely silent on their tough losses in Arizona , Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz are celebrating their late - night wins in Utah â€ “ and in Idaho for the Vermont senator .
Sanders said in a statement : I am enormously grateful to the people of Utah and Idaho for the tremendous voter turnouts that gave us victories with extremely large margins .
The impressive numbers of young people and working - class people who participated in the process are exactly what the political revolution is all about .
These decisive victories in Idaho and Utah give me confidence that we will continue to win major victories in the coming contests .
And Cruz used the Utah victory as a fundraising opportunity : The AP also reports that Ted Cruz is on track to win 50 % of the vote in Utah , which would earn him all 40 delegates in the state â€ “ a significant blow to Donald Trump as the two head toward a contested convention .
Ted Cruz won a much - needed victory against Donald Trump in the Utah caucus , the AP reports .
After an expected loss against the real estate billionaire in the high - stakes Arizona primary , the Utah win for Cruz offers the Texas Senator a victory that can help keep his campaign alive as the GOP race inches closer to a contested convention .
Thereâ€ ™ s little doubt that the powerful Mormon vote in Utah played a big role in securing a win for Cruz here â€ “ in large part because many religious voters have expressed distaste for Trumpâ€ ™ s vulgar style and bombastic statements on immigration .
The win for Cruz also signals big problems for Trump in the general election if he ultimately wins the nomination .
Recent polls have shown that Utahns dislike Trump to such a great degree that the state could actually go blue in November â€ “ something that hasnâ€ ™ t happened in half a century .
Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton would beat Trump in the general election , according to one poll .
Pundits say it could be very tough for a Republican presidential candidate to win the White House without the previously reliable red state of Utah .
At a Salt Lake City caucus site on Tuesday , Perri Flory , a 60-year - old retired police officer , criticized Mormons for backing Cruz , but said she was confident that Trump , her favorite candidate , would not be blocked from the nomination .
Flory said she was thrilled to finally have a candidate speaking the truth on immigration : â€œEveryone who comes here should become a US citizen , and if you break the law , you need to pay for it.â€ �
She added : â€œThe Mormon state is not going to stop Trump.â€ � Bernie Sanders has won a resounding victory in Idaho tonight , as voters attended the Democratsâ€ ™ open caucuses in record numbers .
Sanders could claim most of the 23 Democratic delegates at stake .
The win maintains his relative success in caucus states and those with large white majorities .
From the podium at the Boise Centre , Idaho Democrats claimed that it had been the biggest primary in US history , eclipsing even the landmark turnout in 2008 for current president Barack Obama .
The biggest crowds were in Ada County , centered on the capital , Boise , where 9,115 ballots were cast in the first round â€ “ 80 % of them going Sandersâ€ ™ s way .
Thereâ€ ™ s little doubt that Sanders himself was responsible for bringing Democrats out in large numbers .
In the long queues waiting to enter the caucus venues , there were many first time voters , and many young people who had been energised by the Sanders campaign .
A young supporter , Jeff , attending his first caucus , said Sandersâ€ ™ â€œintegrity , his passions , his motivations make you want to get involved in the process.â€
�
Others were motivated by their fear of the Republican alternatives .
Bernie Sanders has beat Hillary Clinton in Utah , the AP reports : The victory provided a nice boost to Sanders who suffered yet another loss to Clinton in Arizona earlier in the night .
Results in the Democratic caucus in Idaho â€ “ where Sanders could secure another win
â€
“ are still pending .
Earlier , Sanders told a large crowd in San Diego , â€œUnless Iâ€ ™ m mistaken
weâ€ ™ re going to win a couple more tonight.â€
�
The Idaho caucuses are finally winding down after a night of extraordinary turnout , according to Democratic leaders .
Jason Wilson reports : In Boise , people are starting to drift out of the caucus venue , having been told that if they donâ€ ™ t want to change their vote , it will remain as cast .
Volunteers are still counting ballots , and no announcements have been made .
The large turnout has led to inevitable delays - in getting in , and getting ballots counted .
Some caucus - goers have been in queues and waiting in the venue for six hours or more .
Not everyone can afford that on a Tuesday night .
Alissa Taysum , for one , had to wheel her toddler home in a stroller .
But she wasnâ€ ™ t disappointed to leave before she knew the result .
â€œIâ€ ™ m actually really excited that this many people showed up , itâ€ ™ s
exciting.â€
�
She was satisfied that her vote for Bernie Sanders would stick .
One voter , Lisa , said she had to support the candidate with the most experience : Hillary Clinton .
â€œI used to live inside the Beltway .
My husband used to work inside the Beltway .
She understands the big picture .
I donâ€
™ t think he does in the same way .
She could come into office and be effective immediately , on day one.â€ �
The Ted Cruz campaign is trying to remain optimistic in the face of what is shaping up to be a tough loss against Donald Trump in Arizona .
Hereâ€ ™ s Jeff Roe , Cruz campaign manager :
So far , Cruz appears to be far behind Trump , though he may have some good news coming out of Utah shortly .
Late Tuesday evening , Cruz did receive the endorsement of the Club for Growth PAC , which has spent millions in ads to block Trump .
As we wait for the Idaho and Utah results to come in , Jeb Lund is fascinated by the ways talking heads kill dead time Hereâ€
™ s the fun thing about watching the 24-hour news analysts when they donâ€ ™ t have a result : you get to watch the same anxiety over major decisions that we go through for days get played out in high speed .
What did we know before the polls closed ?
Trump wins Arizona , Cruz wins everything else , Clinton wins Arizona , the others are a tossup .
Probably .
But the more time there is to fill , the more second - guessing we can go through .
So we go through Trumpâ€ ™ s negatives .
Or we talk about the size of Sandersâ€ ™ rallies and how eventually the word on him will get out to voters , despite the negative , chiding verbal gatekeeping of the mainstream media .
Meanwhile , appearing at a rally in San Diego , Bernie Sanders did not immediately mention the tough loss in Arizona , instead focusing on his expected wins in Utah and Idaho .
â€œWe have now won ten primaries and caucuses , â€ �
a hoarse - sounding Sanders told supporters .
â€œAnd unless Iâ€ ™ m mistaken weâ€ ™ re going to win a couple more tonight.â€
�
Hereâ€ ™ s a snapshot of the crowd : Hillary Clinton , in Washington , is taking swings at Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in her victory speech following a win in the Arizona primary :
â€œThe last thing we need , my friends , are leaders who incite more fear .
In the face of terror , America doesnâ€ ™ t panic .
We donâ€ ™ t build walls or turn our backs on our allies .
We canâ€ ™ t throw out everything we know about what works and what doesnâ€ ™ t and start torturing people .
What Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and others are suggesting is not only wrong , itâ€ ™ s dangerous .
It will not keep us safe .
This is a time for America to lead , not cower , and we will lead ...
We have to dismantle the global terror pipeline .
We have to strengthen our defenses here at home
and we need to work closely with our allies ...
This election really matters .
We need to keep working together .
We need to make a point that weâ€ ™ re going into the future with confidence and optimism.â€ �
I am the most ready of everybody running to take that job.â€ � Jeb Lund reacts to the Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s win and asks what else Democrats can expect tonight The big question of the night was the Arizona primary , where Sanders dropped $ 1.3 m compared to Clintonâ€ ™ s $ 600,000 , to try to combat her seemingly default advantage among minority voters .
That question has now been answered .
So what about the rest of the night ?
Bernie Sanders was leading Hillary Clinton in Utah according to the last poll , although those polls have flipped in the past .
He could also be leading in Idaho .
Those states could go either way without it being a surprise , in part because nobody seems to want to waste a lot of money on polling there .
Meanwhile , as was the case with the Republican contest , the road to the DNC seems certain .
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s legacy and the Democratic Party
machineâ€ ™ s support and the mainstream mediaâ€ ™ s reflexive dismissal of Bernie Sanders still makes her the prohibitive favorite , and the question is how he plans to use his public acclaim and apportioned delegates to influence the future of the Democratic Party .
What the wins in Arizona mean for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and their challengers hoping to gain traction in the race : The Grand Canyon State is the largest purely winner - takes - all state left in the Republican calendar and is an important stepping stone , in particular , for Trump , who despite his frontrunner status faces a long , drawn - out slog to acquire the 1,237 delegates needed to become the GOP nominee .
The effort to block Trump from securing the Republican ticket rests on preventing him from meeting that necessary delegate threshold , a move that would force the billionaire to make the case for his presidency in a contested convention where party elites , many of whom who are hostile to his candidacy , could hold sway .
Arizona is less significant in the Democratic race , in which delegates are apportioned proportionately , and in which there are another seven states with larger tallies of delegates available before the party convention .
The AP has also announced a Hillary Clinton win in the Arizona primary against Bernie Sanders :
The win offers a nice boost to the frontrunner and makes the ongoing races in Utah and Idaho all the more critical for Sanders .
Donald Trump beat Ted Cruz in the Arizona primary , the Associated Press has just reported :
Itâ€ ™ s a tough loss for Cruz , though not a surprising one , and the win further cements Trumpâ€ ™ s frontrunner status in the Republican race .
Arizona has 58 Republican delegates .
Sam Levin reports on the GOP voters in Utah who really despise Donald Trump : Brad Hansen , a 50-year - old Salt Lake City accountant , stood before a precinct of several dozen Republicans , expressing an anti - Trump sentiment that seems common among conservative Utahns here .
â€œWe oughta build a wall around Trump and make him pay for it ,
â€ �
he said , adding that he didnâ€ ™ t know too much about John Kasich , but that it seemed like the Ohio governor was the only reasonable choice .
Hansen told the Guardian : â€œI want to be represented by someone that is civil and human .
When Trump gets cornered , he gets angry .
Heâ€
™ s never been a real businessman .
Heâ€
™ s never been anything he purports to be.â€
� â€œI really think he started to run as a joke , and it morphed into something big and now he wants to see how long he can play the Americans ...
He hasnâ€ ™ t come up with any ideas.â€ �
He said he needs to do more research on Kasichâ€ ™ s policies , but that he couldnâ€ ™ t imagine voting for anyone else at this point .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s Twitter threat to â€œspill
the beansâ€ � on the wife of Ted Cruz came just minutes before polls closed in Arizona and a few hours ahead of results from Utah .
The tweet , which threatened Cruz and his wife over a Facebook ad run by an anti - Trump Super Pac unrelated to the Texas senator , came as expectations were growing that Trump might underperform and as his response to the terrorist attacks in Brussels has drawn major criticism .
The ad , targeted only to female members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Utah , featured a nude picture of a Trumpâ€ ™ s now - wife , Melania Trump , from a photoshoot for GQ in 2000 .
The frontrunnerâ€ ™ s wife is lying on her front , so the image does not show her fully naked .
The ad had a caption suggesting voters back Cruz lest Trump become the next first lady .
â€œMeet Melania Trump .
Your Next First Lady , â€ � it said .
â€œOr , You Could Support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.â€
�
( Editors decided to remove a version of the ad from this blog , but the image is widely available on the internet , and can be viewed here . )
Trump claimed the ad , targeted only in Utah where anti - Trump forces are hoping that Ted Cruz reach the 50 % threshold needed for him to win all the stateâ€ ™ s delegates , was a personal attack from Texas senator .
Cruz quickly took to Twitter to respond , writing : â€œPic of your wife not from us .
Donald , if you try to attack Heidi , youâ€ ™ re more of a coward than I thought .
# classless ?
From Trumpâ€ ™ s perspective , the spat also serves a distraction from what may be a less than stellar night for Trump .
While the Republican frontrunner is expected to win Arizonaâ€ ™ s primary , it may be , by far , less than expected .
One of the major reasons that Trump is expected to win is that Arizonaâ€ ™ s loose early voting laws meant that a majority of the electorate voted before Tuesday and many anti -
Trump voters cast their ballots for Marco Rubio before he dropped out .
However , Cruz held campaign events in the state on Sunday and may be able to trim the margin .
Trump has also suffered from an off - key response to the massive terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday .
They came just one day after the Republican frontrunner called for the US to play a significantly smaller role in Nato , which is headquartered in Brussels and also flip - flopped yet again on sending ground troops to fight Isis .
In response to the attack , Trump reaffirmed his support for torture and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States while standing by his skepticism of Nato .
Can Trump be stopped ?
The Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund doesnâ€ ™ t think tonight will answer that question â€ “ that will be decided at the convention .
Tonight looks to be one of those primary nights that could provide surprising answers to specific questions , while the general shape of the race remains otherwise unchanged .
We have to take joy in the minutiae of the plot because we know
that the storyâ€ ™
s ending is mostly written .
Trump should walk away with Arizonaâ€ ™ s winner - take all delegates , making Ted Cruz dropping over half a million in that state look like a waste .
Itâ€ ™ s possible
that Ted Cruz knows something that we donâ€ ™ t , but itâ€ ™ s also possible that Ted Cruz realizes Arizona is his last chance to stop The Trump Inevitability .
Or heâ€ ™ s just crazy , which you can never dismiss with Ted Cruz .
In Utah , Cruz has a comfortable lead , in part because Mormons loathe Trump .
Whatâ€ ™ s in question is not his win but the margin .
With over 50 % of the vote , Cruz can walk away with all the apportioned delegates .
Regardless , what weâ€ ™ re liable to emerge with is what we already know : Trump is almost certain to go into the Republican National Convention as the delegate leader , and the question is whether the Republican party can or will screw him out of the nomination Jason Wilson , reporting from a caucus site in Idaho , says the Bernie Sanders side of the room seems more packed than the Hillary Clinton one , but it may be a long night :
Tonight , Idaho Democrats have been somewhat overwhelmed by the large numbers turning out to participate in their caucuses .
In Ada County alone , which includes the capital , Boise , more than 10,000 people came downtown to choose a Democratic candidate .
Statewide , 27,000 made reservations , and 10,000 did so just today .
But caucus - goers can show up without one .
Final turnout is almost certain to be higher still .
This could be the biggest event in the history of Idaho Democratic politics .
Just after 7 pm local time , when the doors were due to be shut , the MC appealed for patience so that the thousands still outside could be processed and admitted to the caucuses .
The line for entry snaked around an entire city block in Boise .
Local officialsâ€ ™ capacity to plan is limited by the fact that this is an open caucus : anyone can participate , whatever their affiliation , as long as they did not also participate in Republican caucuses earlier this month .
This is reflected in the fact that overwhelming majority of those whom I have spoken to are first - time caucus - goers .
Many â€ “ especially the many younger voters
â€ “ have been energized by the candidacy of Bernie Sanders .
But many independents and older Democrats are loyal to Hillary Clinton or appalled by the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency .
Jim , who described himself as an independent , has never attended any caucuses before tonight .
He was sitting in the small amount of allocated seating for undecideds , but he was leaning towards Senator Sanders .
Most of these undecideds are independents ; convinced Democrats have already made their choice .
â€œForeign policy is important , â€ � he said ,
â€œbut what are we going to do to bring jobs back from overseas , so that people can have decent lives?â€
�
The most important question is : â€œHow are we going to take care of Americans , not what are we going to do overseas.â€
�
Heâ€ ™ s come out , in part , because of his alarm at the direction Republicans are taking .
â€œDonald Trump being president ?
That does scare me .
It scares me because of the hatred that he builds.â€ �
Meanwhile in New York City , Guardian reporter Lauren Gambino reports on a dispute between Ted Cruz and New York mayor Bill de Blasio regarding surveillance of Muslims :
Ted Cruz criticized New York mayor Bill de Blasio for abolishing a controversial surveillance program on Muslims during a press conference on Tuesday .
â€œIf you look here in the city of New York , New York had a proactive policing program that Mayor Michael Bloomberg championed to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization , â€ �
Senator Ted Cruz told reporters during a press conference in New York on Tuesday .
â€œMayor Bill de Blasio when he came in , in a peak of political correctness , canceled the program.â€ �
In response , the mayorâ€ ™ s office called Cruzâ€ ™ s reflection of the program
â€œblatantly falseâ€ � .
Monica Klein , a spokeswoman for the mayor , said : â€œNow we know why everyone is calling Ted Cruz a liar.â€ � Donald Trump just threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s wife on Twitter and then promptly deleted the tweet .
Update :
Trump apparently did not regret insulting Cruzâ€ ™ s wife and has just reposted the deleted tweet , this time being sure to add the â€œLyinâ€ ™ Ted Cruzâ€ � label to the post :
Hereâ€ ™ s the ad in question .
It shows an image of Melania Trump posing nude on a blanket .
Paul Lewis reports from Arizona where the final voters are casting their ballots in the GOP and Democratic primaries : The polls here in Arizona will close shortly and , depending on how close the races are , the results could be called quite soon .
Based on the limited polling conducted in the lead - up to today ( and what most local experts say ) these are primaries that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton should win .
Arizona is the biggest prize tonight .
It has more delegates up for grabs than either Utah or Idaho .
Both Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders have campaigned hard in Arizona in recent days , despite their apparent long shots in the state .
What would it mean if either candidate pulled off an upset ?
On the Democratic side , not much .
Arizona apportions delegates proportionately , and Sanders would have to win this and other states by wide margins to convince most strategists that he can begin to turn the race around .
However a Sanders win in Arizona would raise questions over the breadth - and - depth of Clintonâ€ ™ s support , particularly among Latino voters .
Arizona is more important in the Republican race , which is now a test of whether Trump can amass the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination without having to win over party officials in a contested convention .
In the unlikely event Cruz can take Arizonaâ€ ™ s 58 delegates tonight - and also wins Utahâ€ ™ s race , where he is strongly favored , by more than 50 percent ( which would mean he wins all 40 delegates from that state )
â€ “ heâ€ ™ ll put a major dent in Trumpâ€ ™ s effort to win the nomination outright .
Huge crowds in Idaho mean it could be a long night for some trying to participate in the Democratic caucus , Jason Wilson reports : Sam Levin reports from a busy GOP caucus site in Salt Lake City , where hundreds are trying to navigate a confusing process .
Thereâ€ ™ s a fair amount of confusion and chaos at a high school in Salt Lake City where Republican caucus - goers are attempting to sign in and find their precincts in packed hallways , classrooms and auditoriums .
Adding to the confusion is the fact that Republicans for the first time were allowed to vote online this year â€ “ a rarity in elections across the US .
Voters who wanted to participate online had to register by 18 March , and some who didnâ€ ™ t realize there was a deadline were trying â€ “ unsuccessfully
â€ “ to register today .
Others who cast ballots online showed up in person to the caucus and were trying to determine if they needed to vote again .
GOP leaders tried to explain that they did not and should not try to caucus again .
Further complicating matters , some voters who registered online said they forgot their passwords and were having trouble logging on .
Sam Levin reports from a crowded Democratic caucus in Salt Lake City , where voters are hoping their preferred candidate can stop Donald Trump .
Democratic voters in Salt Lake City â€ “ waiting outside an elementary school on a rainy , slightly snowy evening â€ “ said they were united by their desire to keep Donald Trump out of the White House .
Olivia Juarez , 22 , said voters seem to share a common appreciation for Trump and Sanders since theyâ€ ™ re both outsiders who speak their mind and fight for what they believe in .
â€œI really think Sanders is the best candidate to beat Trump .
Trump and Sanders both bring out voters , and people are looking for somebody they can trust.â€ � Friends have tried to convince her that Clinton is more viable and experienced , but Juarez said Sanders would do the best job fighting climate change .
Nahom Tsegai , 27 , said his parents are immigrants from Eritrea and that he is terrified of Trumpâ€ ™ s extreme anti - immigration policies .
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s support of the Dream Act is one of the main reasons why she has his vote .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t feel comfortable voting for [ Sanders],â€ � said Tsegai , an engineer .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s for free education ...
Certainly thatâ€ ™ d be great if it could actually happen , but thatâ€ ™ s a huge promise .
How can you afford to do that?â€ � Clinton would do the best job protecting immigrantsâ€ ™ rights .
â€œThis country needs to be flexible to allow immigrants to come here , â€ � he added .
John Cross , a 54-year - old maintenance worker , said he was a fan of Bill Clinton , but is not fond of his wife : â€œHillary is kind of a criminal .
Sheâ€ ™ s definitely
no Bill , thatâ€ ™ s for sure.â€ �
Cross added , â€œIâ€ ™ m a total Democratic socialist ... and Bernie is the best on climate change and health care.â€

The Guardianâ€ ™ s Jason Wilson files this dispatch from the Boise Centre in Idaho where the Democratic caucus will soon begin .
Along the slow - moving line outside the Boise Centre , the vast majority of voters that the Guardian interviewed were first - time caucus - goers .
A few have only become eligible in the last few years , but many have been energised by whatâ€ ™ s at stake in this election .
One group of Sanders supporters â€ “ Samantha , Jeff and Christa , all in their mid and late 20s
â€ “ were all first - time attendees , despite being eligible in the past .
They said Sanders was the reason they were there
â€ “ â€œ150%â€ � .
Jeff said Sandersâ€ ™ â€œintegrity , his passions , his motivations make you want to get involved in the processâ€ � .
Christa said he was â€œthe only candidate who seems to be honest and really caresâ€ � .
Wayne and Andy were first - timers for Hillary Clinton .
The prospect of a Trump presidency weighed heavily in their considerations .
Wayne said his main reason for opting for Hillary Clinton was â€œto avoid a nightmare .
The opposition is just so frightening.â€
�
This was a common sentiment .
Voters supporting both candidates said they would turn out for the eventual nominee in order to stop Donald Trump or Ted Cruz from becoming president .
Turnout was exceeding expectations as of early evening .
The Ada County Democrats have had to book out an entire extra venue to accommodate interest in the caucuses , expanding from the Boise Centre into the neighboring Centurylink Arena , normally used for ice hockey and basketball .
Welcome to our live coverage of the election night in Arizona , Utah and Idaho .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s west coast bureau chief Paul Lewis is in Arizona , reporter Sam Levin is in Utah and reporter Jason Wilson is in Idaho .
Arizona and Utah have critical GOP and Democratic elections while Idaho is only hosting a Democratic caucus tonight .
In the primary in Arizona , where polls are set to soon close , Ted Cruz is hoping to pull a major upset against Donald Trump .
In Utah , where conservative Mormon voters are not fans of the real estate billionaire , Trump is expected to finish in second or even third place and Cruz is vying to secure more than 50 % of the delegates , which would allow him to win the whole state and put a notable dent in the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s lead .
On the Democratic side , the race could be close in both Utah and Idaho .
In Arizona , Hillary Clinton is leading in the polls against Bernie Sanders , which means a Sanders win would be a major upset for the former secretary of state and current frontrunner ."
2016-03-23,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both won convincing victories in the Arizona presidential primaries on Tuesday , cementing their status as the frontrunners in Republican and Democratic races that are a long way from being settled .
In a sign both contests are shaping up to be long and drawn - out bids for delegates , Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders , the main Republican and Democratic challengers , also notched significant victories in western states .
Cruz swept to victory in Utah , winning more than 50 % of the votes , a pivotal threshold under Utahâ€ ™ s Republican caucus rules , which ensured the Texas senator secured all of the stateâ€ ™ s 40 delegates .
Sanders also registered a resounding victory in Utah and added a second triumph in Idaho , a state where only Democrats were holding a contest on Tuesday .
However , Arizona was the largest delegate prize on Tuesday and was also the most fiercely contested , with Trump , Cruz , Clinton and Sanders all criss - crossing the state in recent days in a last - ditch effort to shore up support .
The strength of the victories by the Republican and Democratic frontrunners in the large , diverse state will add to the growing sense they are nominees - in - waiting , even if they have months of protracted contests ahead of them .
The Grand Canyon State is the largest purely winner - takes - all state left in the Republican calendar , and Trumpâ€ ™ s victory in the state ensured he won all 58 delegates .
At 11 pm local time , with close to half of Arizona votes counted , Trump was on 47 % , compared to Cruzâ€ ™ s 23 % .
Ohio Governor John Kasich was third , with around 10 % .
On the Democratic side , Clinton had a similarly large margin of victory , with 60 % to Sandersâ€ ™ 38 % .
At her victory speech at a rally in Seattle the former secretary of state immediately positioned herself as the Democratic commander - in - chief in waiting , dwelling only briefly on the election results in order to focus instead on a critique of how her Republican rivals responded to the terrorist attacks in Brussels earlier in the day .
Clinton contrasted what she claimed would be her â€œstrong , smart and above all steadyâ€ � leadership in the White House with the reaction of Republicans to the tragedy in Europe .
Trump , who recently said the US should reconsider its involvement in the Nato defense alliance , a cornerstone of Washingtonâ€ ™ s foreign policy , responded to the terrorist atrocity by repeating his call to waterboard terrorism suspects .
Cruz , meanwhile , was widely criticized for reacting to the attacks with a call for law enforcement patrols of Muslim neighborhoods .
â€œIn the face of terror , America doesnâ€ ™ t panic , we donâ€ ™ t build walls or turn our backs on our allies , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t throw out everything that we know about what works and what doesnâ€ ™ t and start torturing people.â€ �
She added : â€œWhat Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and others are suggesting is not only wrong , it is dangerous.â€
�
Appearing at a rally in San Diego before the Utah and Idaho results were in , Sanders did not mention his loss in Arizona , instead focusing on his expected wins .
â€œWe have now won 10 primaries and caucuses , â€ �
a hoarse - sounding Sanders told supporters .
â€œAnd unless Iâ€ ™ m mistaken , weâ€ ™ re going to win a couple more tonight.â€ �
His forecast was correct , and the strength of Sandersâ€ ™ victories in Utah and Idaho , where early voting returns indicated he could win as much as 70 % of the votes , will likely energize his supporters .
The senator from Vermont is also projected to perform well in the last three Democratic states to hold contests in March :
Alaska , Hawaii and Washington .
However , those wins are unlikely to put a decisive dent in the Democratic frontrunnerâ€ ™ s
lead delegates .
Clintonâ€ ™ s lead in delegates selected through primaries and caucuses is bolstered from the pledged support of party officials that also get a say in the nomination process .
With superdelegates included , Clinton went into Tuesday with 1,630 delegates compared to Sandersâ€ ™ 870 .
Sanders contends that superdelegates could still change their minds before the convention and insist the second half of the primary calendar includes states that are better suited to him .
Still , Clinton operatives are privately confident that on the current trajectory the senator from Vermont will face intense pressure to pull out of the race by early summer .
The Republican race appears more complicated still .
While Trump looks on course to end the campaign with the most delegates of any candidate , he may not have the 1,237 required to win the GOP nomination outright .
That would force the billionaire to make the case for his presidency in a contested convention where party elites , many of whom who are hostile to his candidacy , could hold sway .
With Trumpâ€ ™ s projected delegate count expected to come down to the wire , results such as his loss to Cruz in Utah could , later down the line , prove pivotal .
Utahâ€ ™ s large Mormon population always made it steep challenge for Trump , but the race showed signs that Cruz , a conservative stalwart once loathed by the Republican establishment , is starting to mop - up its support .
The self - styled Tea Party senator is desperate to absorb supporters of candidates who have dropped out such as Marco Rubio , Ben Carson and Jeb Bush .
In Utah , he received the unlikely backing of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney .
Cruzâ€ ™ s bid for the mantle of Trumpâ€ ™ s
challenger - in - chief is complicated by Kasich , the third Republican still in the race
and , he argues , the only moderate voice .
His continued presence in the race could sap at the Texan senatorâ€ ™ s pool of potential anti - Trump voters .
Cruz is also hampered by a view among some in the party that that would be no more electable than Trump in a general election â€ “ and possibly less so .
Trump and Cruz were both on the east coast , where most results did not start filtering until late Tuesday night .
Neither had scheduled news conferences or rallies to react to the results .
Instead , on a night when world leaders were grappling with the repercussions of the terrorist bombings in Brussels , which killed at least 31 people and injuring up to 230 , Trump and Cruz ended up in an unseemly Twitter squabble over their wives .
Trump wrongly accusing Cruz of being behind an ad in Utah that used a nude photograph of his wife Melania from a GQ shoot 15 years ago and added : â€œBe careful , Lyinâ€ ™ Ted , or I will spill the beans on your wife!â€ �
Cruz responded : â€œPic of your wife not from us .
Donald , if you try to attack Heidi , youâ€ ™ re more of a coward than I thought.â€ �"

Why is Donald Trump popular ?
Travelling around Americaâ€ ™ s south for his most recent book Deep South , the writer Paul Theroux got some ideas .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the gun show guys , â€ � he says , sitting in his Hawaii home .
â€œVirtually everything Donald Trump says , you can find on a gun show bumper sticker .
Anti - Obama stuff , anti - Muslim stuff , anti - Mexican stuff
, anti - immigrant stuff.â€ �
The 74-year - old warms to his theme .
â€œGun shows are about hating and distrusting the government â€ ¦ people who have been oppressed by a bad economy , by outsourcing .
They have a lot of legitimate grievances and a lot of imagined grievances .
There is this paranoid notion that Washington is trying to take their guns away , take their manhood away , take this symbol of independence away .
They feel defeated .
They hate the Republican party , too .
They feel very isolated.â€ �
Theroux reflects on Trumpmania dominating the Republican primaries and caucuses .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a whole undercurrent of feeling that runs all the way through the United States .
The mood I saw in southern gun shows seems to resonate even with educated , white - collar , Massachusetts Republican voters .
Because Trump won my state of Massachusetts , he won a fairly sizable majority.â€ � Heâ€ ™

The Guardianâ€ ™ s Tom McCarthy is best known for anchoring this liveblog , but heâ€ ™ s also anchoring a new politics podcast pilot weâ€ ™ re testing out for the Guardian !

References to Muslims by politicians have become interchangeable with references to refugees , immigrants andterrorists in much the same way that Mexicans have long been synonymous with drug dealers , criminals and rapists .
And this week , following the attacks in Brussels , a number of presidential candidates had things to say .
As the target of so much attention , itâ€ ™ s worth fact - checking some of those claims made recently about Muslims ...
Ben Carson , who dropped out of the Republican presidential race earlier this month , is grilled on ABCâ€ ™ s
The View for endorsing Donald Trump .
Whoopi Goldberg , one of the showâ€ ™ s co - hosts , asked Carson how he can endorse someone who many believe to hold sexist and racist viewpoints .
Carson says â€œthere is no perfect personâ€ � , and that he is â€œlooking at the big picture.â€ � New York congressman Chris Collins told a New York radio host on Wednesday that billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is much more popular with rank - and - file members of Congress than has been let on .
â€œMany members are supporting Trump quietly , â€ �
Collins told WHMâ€ ™ s Bob Lonsberry , as first reported by Buzzfeed .
â€œThey donâ€ ™ t like Ted Cruz at all , and for various reasons unique to their particular congressional districts theyâ€ ™ re not formally endorsing Mr. Trump.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve had absolutely no negative feedbackâ€ � for being the first member of Congress to endorse Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy , Collins said .
â€œOn the House floor , people know he will be our nominee .
With very few exceptions - four or five individuals - everyoneâ€ ™ s saying they will support the nominee ...
And if itâ€ ™ s Donald Trump , theyâ€ ™ re gon na support him , as we all need to do to defeat Hillary Clinton and the progressive liberal campaign.â€
� ... says the man who has endorsed the candidate who once compared him to a child molester .
Former first daughter and campaign surrogate Chelsea Clinton appears simultaneously pleased with and disgusted by the current war - of - wives being waged by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump .
â€œWell I wouldnâ€ ™ t defend anything that Sen. Cruz and Mr. Trump says or believes in or stands for , â€ �
Clinton said while stumping for her mother , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton .
â€œI think that the level of vitriol goes beyond anything that we certainly have seen in contemporary times in this election , and I think that anyone who is involved in politics.â€ � â€œThankfully , from President Obama to my mom to Senator Sanders on , the Democratic side continues to both stand up against that type of vitriol and hate speech and the personal attacks as well as continue to stand for the types of substantive debates that they and certainly Democrats believe we need to be having in this country , â€ � Clinton said .
Rights groups are considering legal action against North Carolina after the government adopted a law that critics say effectively sanctions the discrimination of LGBT people .
â€œIt flies in the face of democracyâ€ � said Mike Meno , a spokesperson for the ACLU of North Carolina , which is actively looking into a legal challenge against the state with a coalition of rights groups .
â€œThey essentially said itâ€ ™ s okay to discriminate against LGBT people , to turn them away from businesses , to fire them because of who they are or who they love â€ “ and that is not a North Carolina that a lot of people recognize or want to live in , â€ � said Meno .
â€œThis is something that was done by extremists in the legislature who are out of step with many communities across our state.â€œ Another day , another clatch of polls - this time , a survey from Bloomberg Politics that shows Vermont senator Bernie Sanders edging out former secretary of state Hillary Clinton by a single point .

But !
These data are interesting beyond the notion that Sanders is favored by 49 % of Democrats while Clinton is preferred by 48 % .
The reason theyâ€ ™ re interesting ?
Itâ€ ™ s all about the economy ( stupid ) .
Democratic voters feel that Sanders is the more reliable candidate to work for the middle class and do the most to fight Wall Street influence over government by a massive margin : 62 % say heâ€ ™ d â€œfight hardest for the middle class , â€ � and 64 % say heâ€ ™ d do the most to â€œrein in Wall Street.â€
�
While Clinton scores better in areas like temperament , foreign policy and experience , the plurality of voters say that income inequality and unemployment are the most important issues facing the country right now - which gives Sanders the edge .

Since Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy , Republicans in the senate have argued that it would be inappropriate to take up such a nomination in the heat of an election year â€ “ and their Exhibit A is a speech that vice president Joe Biden made on the senate floor in 1992 .
In the speech , which is posted below , Biden did argue against considering a Supreme Court nomination during a presidential election season .
But today , in an address at Georgetown University , Biden argued that he had been quoted selectively .
Because he was , as chairman of the judiciary committee at the time , willing in principle to hold hearings on a nominee , he said .
He never considered , Biden said today , the possibility of not holding hearings on such a nominee .
Guardian Washington correspondent David Smith watched the speech .
Heâ€ ™ s live tweeted much of it , as prelude to a news story on the way .
Hereâ€ ™ s
David : Biden :
Let me set the record straight .
I made it absolutely clear that I would go ahead if the nominee were selected with advice of senate .
Biden : We should proceed with the advice and consent of the senate , as the constitution states .
Biden :
On committee I was responsible for nine nominees for the supreme court , more than anyone alive .
Biden : â€œEvery nominee , including Justice Kennedyâ€”in an election
yearâ€”got
an up or down vote by the senate.â€
�
Biden : â€œNot much of the time .
Not most of the time .
Every single time!â€ �
Biden :
Saying nothing , hearing nothing , seeing nothing .
Deciding to turn your back is not an option the constitution leaves open .
Biden :
Itâ€ ™ s an abdication of responsibility â€œthat has never happened before in our historyâ€ � .
Biden :
Congress has become â€œalmost entirely dysfunctionalâ€ � .
Biden :
When the senate refuses to even consider a nominee , it prevents the court from discharging its constitutional â€œsolemn dutyâ€ � .
The 1992 speech on the Senate floor in which Biden argued against considering a Supreme Court nomination in a presidential election season : Donald Trump has collected footage of three former presidential candidates who have endorsed Ted Cruz â€ “ Jeb Bush , Carly Fiorina and Lindsey Graham â€ “ speaking ill of Ted Cruz .

What do you know , we agree on something : Americans of both major political parties are united in their dislike of free trade , a Bloomberg poll finds .
44 % say the North American Free Trade Agreement ( Nafta ) has been bad for the US economy and 29 % say itâ€ ™ s been a positive development , according to the survey .
Pollsters also found that most Americans say they would be willing to pay a little bit more for goods made in the United States , and that they would rather a US - owned factory employing 1,000 opened in their community than a Chinese - owned factory employing twice that many .
Virtually every question of policy has a Republican - Democrat split , â€ � said pollster J. Ann Selzer , who oversaw the survey .
â€œOn trade , there is unity.â€ �
Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have tapped the vein of protectionism , with Sanders advertising â€œthe real cost of Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s free trade policiesâ€ � and Trump as much as promising a trade war .
Clinton supported the Trans - Pacific Partnership as secretary of state , although she now opposes it ; her husband signed Nafta .
Hereâ€ ™ s a fun interview with Republican strategist Rick Wilson on the Trump phenomenon : First question , first answer : Youâ€ ™ ve gained lots of fans on the left thanks to your vicious descriptions of Trump and his supporters .
Once , on MSNBC , you called his base â€˜â€˜childless single men who masturbate to anime.â€ ™ â€ ™ That was in reference to the alt - right part of his base .
I wish I could take credit for it being a broader smear .
If one is going to insult a group of people who think that Trump is their own private postmodern Hitler , one ought to be specific .
Hereâ€ ™ s a selection of photos from outside a Bernie Sanders rally yesterday evening in Los Angeles :
Trump : â€œIllegal immigration , take the oil , build the wall , Muslims , NATO!â€ �
You know what he means .
Trump has won 19 state Republican presidential nominating contests .
Plus the Northern Marianas .
He has 274 more pledged delegates than his closest rival .
Three new polls Wednesday night showed him ahead with GOP voters by an average of 8 points .
He hasnâ€ ™ t held a public event for three days .
â€œN.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!â€ � Donald Trump tweeted Thursday .
The statement was in keeping with Trumpâ€ ™ s critique of the costs of maintaining a US military presence in Japan , the Persian Gulf , Europe and elsewhere .
In Trumpâ€ ™ s view , the US is spending too much to cover other countriesâ€ ™ security costs .
Might the US be paying in part to address US security interests in those places ?
He doesnâ€ ™ t get into it .
The US makes bad deals because the leadershipâ€ ™ s stupid , is his take .
In a speech Wednesday at Stanford University , Hillary Clinton called the view â€œdangerous.â€
� â€œIf Mr Trump gets his way it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œTurning our back on our alliances or turning our alliance into a protection racket would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and would send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike.â€

Hereâ€ ™ s the tweet Trump RTâ€ ™ d before the one with the photo split : Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi has a look at claims the US presidential candidates have made about Muslims this week .
Here , for example , from the Texas senator : Ted Cruz â€œIf you look here in the city of New York , New York had a proactive policing program that Mayor Michael Bloomberg championed to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization.â€ � - Speaking at a news conference in New York , 22 March 2016
Cruz made the comment hours after the attacks in Brussels on Tuesday , in a speech outlining a proposal to â€œpatrol and secure Muslim
neighborhoodsâ€
� .
His description of NYPDâ€ ™ s â€œproactive policing programâ€ � could make it hard to figure out which scheme Cruz is referring to â€ “ because the NYPD Muslim monitoring scheme is generally referred to as their surveillance program .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) certainly doesnâ€ ™ t describe the NYPD scheme , which has been in place since at least 2002 ,
as â€œproactiveâ€ �
â€ “
their site explains :
The NYPDâ€ ™ s surveillance program is based on a false and unconstitutional premise : that Muslim religious belief and practices are a basis for law enforcement scrutiny .
New Yorkâ€ ™ s federal courts would seem to agree .
In January , the NYPD lost two civil rights lawsuits that accused the force of unfairly monitoring Muslims .
Cruzâ€ ™ s claim that the program worked â€œcooperativelyâ€ � with New Yorkâ€ ™ s Muslims is also a very generous reading of practices such as tracking individuals and using so - called â€œmosque crawlersâ€ � .

Donald Trump not only maintains his polling lead among Republicans in three new surveys â€ “ most Republican voters agree with him that if he wins the most delegates before the national convention , even if itâ€ ™ s not an outright majority , he should be the nominee .
A Bloomberg poll found 63 % of Republicans who have voted or plan to vote in the primary process think Trump should be nominated if he leads the delegates race in July .
One problem , for Republicans , is that the same poll found that Trump was viewed unfavorably by 68 % of Americans .

â€œItâ€ ™ s ridiculous.â€ �"
2016-03-25,"Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s presidential campaign is drawing extreme anti - Muslim propagandists into the mainstream of US politics , academics and Muslim civil rights groups are warning .
On Wednesday , Cruz inflamed the debate about so - called â€œhomegrownâ€ � terrorism in America in the wake of the Brussels bombings by calling on law enforcement to â€œpatrol and secure Muslim
neighborhoodsâ€ � .
The remarks came days after the Texas senator announced the appointment of his foreign policy advisory team that included some of the most outspoken Islamophobes of the post-9/11 period .
In the wake of the Paris and Brussels terrorist attacks , much of the debate over terrorism within the US has been dominated by Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s promise to ban all Muslims entering the country .
The Republicanâ€ ™ s proposal to close the borders to Muslims , among several of his other controversial policies , has prompted establishment GOP figures to swing behind Cruz as the â€œstop - Trumpâ€ � candidate .
Yet by rushing to Cruzâ€ ™ s aid , the Republican leadership is in danger of embracing a candidate who is even more extreme in his Islamophobic posturing than the current frontrunner .
Cruzâ€ ™ s foreign policy team includes people who have called for all mosques to be shut down across America , claimed the country is being subverted by the Muslim Brotherhood and decried all followers of the Islamic faith as jihadists .
â€œThis is more than worrying , it is terrifying , â€ � said Nathan Lean , a specialist in Islamophobia at Georgetown Universityâ€ ™ s Bridge Institute .
â€œBringing such views into a presidential campaign inflames the anxieties of ordinary Americans and gives them license to amp up scrutiny and skepticism towards the Muslim community.â€ �
The most prominent anti - Muslim among Cruzâ€ ™ s
new set of advisers is Frank Gaffney , whose Washington - based thinktank the Center for Security Policy is listed by the monitoring group the Southern Poverty Law Center as an extremist organization devoted to conspiracy theories .
A former defense official under Ronald Reagan , Gaffney has long argued that the Egyptian - based Islamic movement the Muslim Brotherhood is actively undermining American society and government in a stealthy power grab that he calls â€œcivilization jihadâ€ � .
Gaffney and his thinktank have gone so far as to accuse Huma Abedin , a top adviser to Hillary Clinton , of being in on the conspiracy .
He has also been banned on more than one occasion from attending the annual Conservative Political Action Committee ( CPAC ) after he claimed two of its board members were Muslim Brotherhood infiltrators .
A pamphlet published last year by the Center for Security Policy encouraged â€œordinary Americansâ€ � to lobby their political representatives to put a stop to any more Muslim immigration .
â€œSpeak up against the opening of more mosques in your neighborhoods ; they are literally the beachheads for the expanding Muslim population as it marks its expanding territory
, â€ � the thinktank said .
Gaffneyâ€ ™ s ideas were not long ago considered to lie on the fringes of political discourse in America .
But the Republican presidential debate has brought them steadily into the mainstream .
The first move to embrace Gaffney and bring him into the fold was made by Trump in his call to ban all Muslim immigration last December .
In making his provocative announcement , Trump cited a discredited opinion poll published by the Center for Security Policy that claimed , without substantiation , that a quarter of all American Muslims believed that violence against their fellow citizens was justified â€œas part of global jihadâ€ � .
A month later , Ben Carson , then still in the Republican race , invoked Gaffneyâ€ ™ s theory of â€œcivilization jihadâ€ � during a televised presidential debate .
But of all the Republican candidates , Cruz has gone the furthest .
By officially appointing Gaffney , along with two other Center for Security Policy staff â€ “ Clare Lopez and Fred Fleitz â€ “ to his presidential campaign team he has gone some way to legitimizing a set of beliefs that had previously been regarded as cranky or marginal .
In 2013 , at a public meeting in New Jersey , Lopez branded all Muslims as jihadists .
â€œWhen people in bona fide religions follow their doctrines they become better people
â€ “ but itâ€ ™ s Hindus , Christians and Jews .
When Muslims follow their doctrine they become jihadists , â€ � she said .
The Guardian invited the Cruz campaign and Frank Gaffney to comment on criticism of their relationship , but neither responded .
Cruzâ€ ™ s connections to Gaffney can be traced back at least to early 2014 , a year after he joined the US senate .
In January Cruz attended a Gaffney event called â€œAmerican security and the Iranian bombâ€ � .
From March 2014 both men attended a series of national security summits held by the rightwing website Breitbart , and last year Cruz spoke in person at an election event organized by Gaffney in South Carolina , and was beamed in by video at similar public meetings in Iowa , New Hampshire and Nevada .
The presidential candidate has also been a guest on Gaffneyâ€ ™ s radio show , â€œsecure freedom radioâ€ � , at least three times : in April 2014 , and February and September 2015 .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not surprising that Cruz and Gaffney have become close in the past couple of years , â€ � said Stephen Piggott , senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center .
â€œThey have very similar world views in believing that radical Islam is the largest problem that America faces , and that every Muslim is a potential terrorist.â€ � Gaffney , Lopez and Fleitz are not the only controversial figures among Cruzâ€ ™ s new 23-strong crew of foreign policy advisers .
Also on the team is Lt Gen Jerry Boykin , former undersecretary of defense for intelligence in the George W Bush administration .
Since retiring from the military in 2007 Boykin has been outspoken in his anti - Muslim opinions .
Like Gaffney , he has touted the conspiracy theory that the American government has been infiltrated by the Muslim Brotherhood and called for the eradication of all mosques in the US .
In 2012 Boykin told the Family Research Council , of which he is now a senior executive , that â€œby the middle of this century
the continent of Europe will be an Islamic continent , and they canâ€ ™ t reverse it , they canâ€ ™ t stop it .
It is because they took Jesus out of their societies and itâ€ ™ s been replaced by darkness.â€ � Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations , accused Cruz of â€œadding fuel to the fireâ€ � by elevating the opinions of Boykin , Gaffney and others to the level of trusted advisers .
â€œThese are dangerous times .
I and my community are worried about the future â€ “ about what a Donald Trump or Ted Cruz administration would bring.â€ �"
2016-03-25,"Ted Cruz accused â€œDonald Trump and his henchmenâ€ � of spreading lies about his personal life in a story that appeared in the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid on Wednesday .
The story marked the latest in a back and forth between Cruz and Trump where the Republican frontrunner has repeatedly tweeted about the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s wife and the tone of the race for the White House has plunged to new depths .
In the Friday press conference after a campaign event in Oshkosh , Wisconsin , Cruz used his most heated language yet , saying of his rival â€œDonald may be a rat
but I have no desire to copulate with himâ€ � while also accusing Trump of â€œpeddl[ing ] sleaze and slimeâ€ � .
The result is that Cruz , who long called Trump a friend and insisted he would support the Republican nominee in November , started to back away from that pledge .
â€œI do not make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family , â€ �
he told reporters .
In a Facebook post , Cruz made clear that he held the Trump campaign directly responsible for the story .
â€œFor Donald J Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald wonâ€ ™ t go , â€ � wrote Cruz .
The unsourced story recycled gossip without any evidence that Cruz , a married father of two , had been involved in a series of extramarital affairs .
Asked by the Guardian if the campaign had any comment on the allegations from Cruz that Trump was responsible for the National Enquirer story , spokeswoman Hope Hicks said : â€œThere is absolutely no truth to that.â€ �
In a statement emailed by Hicks , Trump said he had â€œabsolutely nothing to do withâ€
�
the National Enquirer story .
Using a nickname he has given Cruz on the campaign trail , Trump added : â€œUnlike Lyinâ€ ™ Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman and then pretend total innocence .
â€œTed Cruzâ€ ™ s problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone , and while they were right about OJ Simpson , John Edwards and many others , I certainly hope they are not right about Lyinâ€ ™ Ted Cruz.â€ � Katrina Pierson , one of the women with whom Cruz allegedly had an affair , is a Trump spokeswoman .
She denied the story on Twitter .
A Trump surrogate brought up the story unprompted in a CNN appearance earlier on Friday .
Furthermore , Trump has long been friends with David Pecker , the owner of the National Enquirer .
The only person quoted by name in the article is Roger Stone , a long - time political aide to the billionaire .
Trump first brought up Cruzâ€ ™ s wife in a Tuesday night tweet just as polls were closing in Arizona and Utah .
He threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on Heidi Cruz in retaliation for an anti - Trump Super Pac with no ties to the Cruz campaign running a Facebook ad that featured a partially nude picture of a Trumpâ€ ™ s now - wife , Melania , from a GQ photoshoot in 2000 .
The ad , which was targeted at female members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Utah , suggested voters back Cruz .
The message , overlying an image of Trumpâ€ ™ s wife lying on a fur rug read : â€œMeet Melania Trump .
Your Next First Lady .
Or , You Could Support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.â€
�
Later that night , Trump went on to retweet a picture of Melania Trump juxtaposed with an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz that was posted by a supporter .
The Republican frontrunner suggested in August that his retweets were endorsements .
â€œI retweet for a reason
, â€ � he told reporters then .
Cruz immediately responded on Twitter by saying â€œPic of your wife not from us .
Donald , if you try to attack Heidi , youâ€ ™ re more of a coward than I thought .
# classless.â€
�
He went on to invoke the movie The American President in an interview with CNN on Wednesday .
â€œIf Donald wants to get in a character fight , heâ€ ™ s better off sticking with me because Heidi is way out of his league , â€ � an almost word - for - word reference to a line from the 1995 movie starring Michael Douglas ."
2016-03-25,"Ted Cruz held a press conference to call a tabloid story alleging that he had extramarital affairs â€œliesâ€ � and a â€œsmear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmenâ€ � .

2016-03-25,"Few communities in the US should be as concerned about Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s proposal to aggressively surveil Muslims than Brooklynâ€ ™ s Bay Ridge .
The neighborhood is home to one of the largest Muslim enclaves in the country , estimated at over 30,000 .
A walk down Fourth Avenue will turn up as many shop awnings in Arabic as in English , and women in hijab and niqab are as common a sight as business suits in Manhattanâ€ ™ s financial district .
But here , perhaps as much as anywhere , the reaction for many is closer to apathy .
Cruzâ€ ™ s comments â€œseem like a revelation to everyone else and my response is that itâ€ ™ s already been happening , â€ � said Linda Sarsour , executive director of the Arab - American Association of New York .
Sarsour , a lifelong Brooklynite and Bay Ridge resident added : â€œMuslim communities around the country have been under constant surveillance for the past 15 years.â€ � Cruz , currently second in the race for the Republican nomination , proposed that law enforcement officials ramp up efforts to â€œpatrol and secure Muslim neighborhoodsâ€
� in response to the terror attacks in the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday .
Isis has claimed credit for the bombings that left 31 people dead and more than 200 injured .
But as Sarsour observed , such a program is nothing new .
The NYPD famously embarked on an expansive dragnet of surveillance efforts directed at the cityâ€ ™ s Muslim residents in the wake of 9/11 .
One of those programs â€ “ known as the demographics unit â€ “ was assembled to study and map 28 â€œancestries of interestâ€ � , the Associated Press reported in 2011 , most of them Muslim .
Undercover officers in this unit were tasked with visiting community locations like bookstores and cafes to look for â€œhot spotsâ€ � of potential extremist sentiment .
Faisal , a 17-year - old Bay Ridge resident said he couldnâ€ ™ t remember a time before the possibility of surveillance was a normal part of life .
â€œItâ€ ™ s just part of growing up Muslim in New York , I guess , â€ � he said , shrugging .
The NYPD suspended its demographics program under Mayor Bill de Blasioâ€ ™ s direction in 2014 , a move Cruz described on Wednesday as a kowtow to â€œpolitical
correctnessâ€ � .
New York , Cruz said in a statement , â€œsuccumbed to unfounded criticisms and eliminated the efforts of law enforcement to work with Muslim communities to stop radical Islamic terrorism.â€
�
New York officials fired back quickly , with the mayorâ€ ™ s office calling Cruzâ€ ™ s statement â€œblatantly falseâ€ � and police commissioner Bill Bratton calling the plan out of step with American values .
Bratton added â€œthe statements [ Cruz ] made today is why heâ€ ™ s not going to become president of this country.â€ �
The city is facing continued litigation over the surveillance of Muslims including the pending case of Hassan v City of New York , which is seeking to have the courts declare the surveillance program unconstitutional , order the NYPD to â€œimmediately stop spying on our clientsâ€ � , and destroy any records related to the programs .
Omar Fareh , one of the attorneys arguing the case for the Center for Constitutional Rights said â€œblanket , discriminatory policing of a religious group â€ “ based as it is on crude stereotypes â€ “ simply does not work .
It was right of Mr Bratton to acknowledge as much in his recent remarks.â€ � Bratton even defended the abandoning of the demographics program in November , claiming â€œnot one single piece of actionable intelligence ever came out of that unit in its years of existenceâ€ � .
Sarsour said the end of the program was welcome , but added by the time it was shut down , â€œit had already accomplished its mission to map the Muslim community .
They know where we are.â€ � The now - defunct demographics unit did not encompass the sum of the NYPD surveillance tactics that activists and community members find far more distressing , either .
In the same November press conference where Bratton defended the end of the program he spoke cheerfully about the other methods for identifying threats like â€œsocial media , use of informantsâ€ � and the â€œdevelopment of relationshipsâ€ � . â€œThereâ€ ™ s no shortage of ability to get intelligence , â€ � Bratton said at the time .
Fahd Ahmed knows these methods well .
Ahmed is the acting executive director of the South Asian Organizing Center , which has been protesting and promoting activism around Muslim profiling since 9/11 .
He recalls in 2012 how during a protest against the police for the very act of surveillance , â€œwe had someone come join our contingent who we later found out was an NYPD informant , â€ � Ahmed said .
â€œHe kept coming to events .
Not really knowing people , not really socializing with people and building connections
â€ “ just showing up.â€
�
Defenders of these informant programs say they have led to the diffusion of credible threats , like the 2004 arrest of Shahawar Matin Siraj and James Elshafay for an alleged bombing plot on the New York City subway system planned with an informant .
Detractors argue that these informant interactions amount to entrapment , preying on impressionable young minds .
Ahmed said the city made â€œa lot of fanfareâ€ � out of the closing of the demographics unit , but stressed it was virtually defunct anyways .
â€œThe other programs that actually were spying and doing intelligence gathering in the community continue , â€ � he said .
More recently , in January the city settled a lawsuit that accused the NYPD of suspicionless and warrantless blanket surveillance , agreeing to not pursue investigations where â€œrace , religion , or ethnicity is the substantial or motivating factor.â€ �
But in the settlement the department admitted to no â€œimproper practicesâ€ � and claimed that the anti - discrimination component was just a reiteration of what had been their policy all along .
But Zein Rimawi doesnâ€ ™ t fully recognize that NYPD .
The Palestinian - American immigrated to Bay Ridge from a small town north - west of Jerusalem in 1982 and said post-9/11 profiling has â€œterrorizedâ€ � him and his family .
â€œThey came to my house , they came to my business , and they stop me in the street ,
â€ � Rimawi said .
He is a board member of the Arab Muslim American Federation and is very active in the local Muslim community .
Rimawi , who has been employed in a variety of fields , now works coordinating a senior center where older New Yorkers , mostly Arab - Americans , come for meals and activities .
In his opinion the relationship between the the local precinct in Bay Ridge and the Muslim community is actually â€œvery strongâ€ � , but he added â€œthese other officers come from Manhattan with these programs and who knows what theyâ€ ™ re thinking.â€
� As for Cruz , and the Republican frontrunner , Donald Trump , who has repeatedly proposed a moratorium on Muslims entering the US , Rimawi said their overblown rhetoric is making the post-9/11 attitude towards Muslims look like â€œa honeymoonâ€ � .
But Rimawi was not wavered by any of it .
â€œWe can not go anywhere else .
Weâ€ ™ re here .
Maybe they donâ€
™ t love us but we love them .
Itâ€ ™ s up to the people whether they will accept us , â€ � he said ."
2016-03-27,"Donald Trump has said he and his campaign â€œhad nothing to doâ€ � with a National Enquirer story that this week claimed Ted Cruz , the billionaireâ€ ™ s chief remaining rival for the Republican presidential nomination , had a series of extramarital affairs .
In turn , Cruz , who has also been involved in a bitter exchange with Trump over the two candidatesâ€ ™ wives , repeated his charge that Trump and his â€œhenchmenâ€ � fabricated and planted the tabloidâ€ ™ s story .
â€œI had nothing to do with it , â€ �
Trump said , in a phone interview with ABC on Sunday .
â€œThe campaign had absolutely nothing to do with it .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s got a problem with the National Enquirer .
I have no control over the National Enquirer .
I didnâ€

I just got it last night .
Somebody sent it to me over to read , so I could at least see what it said .
I had nothing to do whatsoever with the National Enquirer.â€
�
For Cruz to say he or his campaign were responsible for the story , Trump added , was â€œdisgracefulâ€
� .
â€œBy the way ,
â€ �
Trump said , switching to the spat over the two menâ€ ™ s wives , â€œheâ€ ™ s the one who started it .
Melania
[ Trump ] did a cover shoot for GQ , a very strong modelling picture , no big deal â€ ¦
it was fine.â€ �
A Cruz - supporting Super Pac â€ “ with which the Texas senator has , by law , no direct link â€ “ used the pictures of Trumpâ€ ™ s wife in a political ad .
â€œFrom what I hear
, somebody bought the rights to it ,
â€ �
Trump continued â€œAnd just so you understand , that Super Pac is very friendly to Ted Cruz .
â€œHe knew all about it , 100%,â€ �
Trump concluded , in a casual accusation that Cruz violated federal law by coordinating with a Super Pac .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s very close to the Super Pac .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no way in a million years that Super Pac did that without his absolute knowledge.â€
�
For his part , Cruz told Fox News Sunday Trump had gone after his wife because Trump had no answers to the foreign policy and security questions raised by
this weekâ€
™ s Brussels bombing .
â€œSo what does he do?â€
� he asked .
â€œHe attacks my wife .
He sent out a nasty tweet , bragging his wife was so attractive .
Attacking spouses and children is off limits .
But this is what Donald does when he gets scared : he attacks .
He doesnâ€
™ t know what to do .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a sign of how scared he is .
He refuses to debate because he doesnâ€ ™ t want America to see his lack of knowledge.â€ �
ABC host Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he condemned the thinly sourced National Enquirer story â€ “ Roger Stone , a Republican operative with links to the Trump campaign , is quoted within it â€ “ which Cruz has emphatically rejected .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t care , â€ � said Trump .
â€œIâ€ ™ m really
â€ “
I donâ€ ™ t care .
The National Enquirer did a story .
It was their story .
It wasnâ€ ™ t my story .
It was about Ted Cruz .
I have no idea whether it was right or not .
They actually have a very good record of being right .
But I have absolutely no idea .
â€œFrankly , I said , â€˜I hope itâ€ ™ s not right.â€ ™ â€ �
Cruz said he was still in no doubt where the National Enquirer story came from .
â€œIt came for Trump and his henchmen , â€ � he told Fox .
â€œIt came from Roger Stone , the enforcer from Donald Trump .
Itâ€ ™ s all made - up lies .
Total garbage and a sign of just how long he will go.â€ �
The National Enquirer , Cruz said , had endorsed Trump .
â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t want to talk about the issues , â€ � he repeated .
â€œHe has no answers .
So he goes to garbage , sleaze and lies .
This has no place in politics.â€ �
On ABC , Trump was asked what he had been talking about when he threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s wife .
â€œThere are things about Heidi that I donâ€ ™ t want to talk about , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œYou could look.â€ �"
2016-03-27,"Iâ€ ™ ve been keeping a list , as this election season shambles toward its climax , of things that might mount a more dignified , qualified , intellectually rigorous fight for the presidency of the US than our two Republican frontrunners , Ted Cruz and Donald Trump .
At this point , I have : â€¢ Two air horns in an off - balance washing machine .
â€¢ Two baby bears who ate too much honey and are all tuckered out .
â€¢ A melting butter sculpture of a lizard and a dried apricot that fell on the barbershop floor .
â€¢ A wet paper towel with low self - esteem and a lamprey that did too much cocaine and thinks it can â€œdestroy Isisâ€ � .
â€¢ Bill S Preston Esq and Ted â€œTheodoreâ€
� Logan .
â€¢ A bar of soap with a hair on it and my grandma , who is dead .
Itâ€ ™ s difficult to understand how any American human being with a healthy sense of self - preservation would voluntarily place their nation , their body , and their livelihood in the hands of either of these incompetent , bleating clowns ; never more so than after this
weekâ€ ™ s demonstration of how the two noble statesmen plan to comport themselves during their battle for the nomination and the presidency beyond â€ “ that plan being , apparently , to reduce the future of my country ( and the world ) to a hottest wife contest .
It all started when , in the hope of swaying religious voters whose fear of womenâ€ ™ s sexual autonomy outweighs their love of xenophobic wall - themed frottage , an anti - Trump rightwing super PAC circulated a nude photo of former model Melania Trump , implying that she wasnâ€ ™ t the â€œrightâ€ � kind of woman to occupy the White House .
( Itâ€ ™ s a well - known fact that none of our previous 43 first ladies have possessed genitals . )
Trump , claiming that the ad was orchestrated by Cruz , shot back with a tweet that Iâ€ ™ m pretty sure he copied verbatim from a collection of FDRâ€ ™ s fireside chats : Cruz , apparently dreading the exposure of his wifeâ€ ™ s mysterious beans , attempted to calm the situation : But Trump , undeterred , then retweeted an image posted by one of his followers â€ “ an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz side by side with a dolledâ€‘up beauty shot of Melania , with the caption : â€œNo need to â€˜spill the beans.â€ ™
The images are worth a thousand words.â€ �
Finally , sensing an opportunity to slime his way to the high ground , Cruz responded : â€œDonald , real men donâ€ ™ t attack women .
Your wife is lovely , and Heidi is the love of my life.â€ �
( Reminder : statistically , a child dies by gun violence in the US every other day , which means that we lost at least two while these adult males who think they deserve to be in charge of a country were having an internet slap - fight about their girlfriendsâ€ ™ butts . )
Setting aside the notion that a womanâ€ ™ s looks determine her value , as well as the dehumanising reduction of Heidi Cruz and Melania Trump ( two successful , professional women with fully formed , complex lives ) to inanimate chips in a dick - swinging contest , the most odious thing about this whole exchange is that it positions Ted Cruz as the good guy when it comes to gender .
Cruz is a man who believes that â€œevery human life is a precious gift from God , which should be protected from the moment of conception until the moment of natural deathâ€ � â€ “ in other words , all pregnant people should be treated as incubators and forced to give birth .
He supports a federal ban on abortion after 20 weeks , without exception .
Are you a woman with a wanted pregnancy who found out at 21 weeks that your foetus is not viable ?
Sorry !
Carry it inside of you for four more months because Ted Cruz says so !
Are you a developmentally disabled 11-year - old girl who was raped by your father and no one discovered it until you were six months along ?
Hope you survive pregnancy
so you can claim your gift from God !
The Great Trump v Cruz objectification - off of 2016 isnâ€ ™ t
just bad statesmanship or a goofy sideshow ; itâ€ ™ s one manifestation of a fundamental misogynist bigotry that is in the Republican partyâ€ ™ s DNA .
Whether youâ€ ™ re Trump , leveraging your wifeâ€ ™ s body as social capital while calling women who challenge you
â€œfat pigsâ€ � and â€œdogsâ€ � , or Cruz , paying watery lip service to not attacking women while working full - time to strip women of basic , life - saving healthcare , American conservatives make it abundantly clear that they do not fully believe that women are people .
Not even if theyâ€ ™ re in the same party .
Not even if theyâ€ ™ re in the same house .
Not even if theyâ€ ™ re in the same bed .
Women , especially conservative women : you do not have to support men who treat you like this .
You do not have to hang out with them , live with them , marry them , coddle them , praise them , listen to them talk , or put up with them at work .
You especially do not have to vote for them .
Trust me , they wouldnâ€ ™ t vote for you ."
2016-03-28,"The race for the Republican presidential nomination has seen some extraordinary anti - Muslim rhetoric .
Donald Trump called for a â€œtotal and complete shutdownâ€ � of the countryâ€ ™ s borders to Muslims .
In the aftermath of the Brussels attacks on 22 March , Ted Cruz said that law enforcement should â€œpatrol and secure Muslim neighborhoodsâ€ � .
The Guardian asked Muslim - Americans from neighborhoods around the United States to tell us what impact this focus on their communities has had as they go about their lives .
Jalal Baig , Chicago :
â€˜There is no incubator of terrorism here .
There are only Americansâ€ ™
I have had the privilege of spending my formative years in Chicago , which has many neighborhoods that serve as a microcosm of the Muslim world .
Whether shopping on the frenetic streets of Devon Avenue alongside South Asians or consuming shwarma sandwiches in the hospitality of Arabs in Bridgeview , you will find individuals who have not only embraced their identities as Muslim - Americans but also the accompanying responsibilities .
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s casting aspersions about the Muslims who reside here is misguided and an attempt to strip them of their common humanity .
Inhabitants here shared aspirations , lofty and mundane , similar to those of neighboring communities .
The basic desires to pursue happiness in the company of family and friends and nurture children for a brighter future exist in these homes and on these streets â€ “ as much as in any other American neighborhoods .
There is no incubator of terrorism here .
There are only Americans .
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s brazen statements are repugnant and incendiary â€ “ and a desperate attempt to burnish his credentials as an Islamophobe for the electorate .
Though there is naturally outrage and indignation at Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s statements , the prevailing conviction here is that he will fail .
For in Chicago , just like America , Muslims are an invaluable part of a much larger community : humanity .
Burhan Mohumed , Minneapolis , Minnesota : â€˜We see police as an occupying forceâ€ ™
Here in Cedar - Riverside , where I live , the Somali community is already targeted by surveillance .
Immigrant communities find it hard to exercise their rights
â€ “ its hard to stand up for yourself without privilege .
Law enforcement take advantage of that fact .
If youâ€ ™ re black , an immigrant and Muslim youâ€ ™ re already petrified .
Thatâ€ ™ s why so many donâ€ ™ t speak up .
Cruzâ€ ™ s comments are deplorable .
But whatâ€ ™ s more deplorable is the domestic policies that are already in place .
This is far more inflammatory than whatever Cruz says .
Every community of color and every Muslim community is already being watched .
In Riverside , the FBI has walked into peopleâ€ ™ s homes without warrants and interrogated under - age youth in our community .
And programs like Countering Violent Extremism , a de - radicalization program , are fueling divisions , mistrust and the sense that we are being scapegoated .
Many such programs claim to be about providing after - school activities but are really just there to collect information about us for law enforcement .
This is damaging and incriminating to our youth because it labels and stigmatizes them .
Thatâ€ ™ s why , in my community , we see police as an occupying force .
They treat us without respect and dignity .
We are watched and documented as threats , criminals and potential terrorists .
A lot of domestic terror is committed by far - right groups .
Why are they not targeted by surveillance and profiling ?
Farhana Shahid , Los Angeles , California : â€˜I especially fear for what will happen to my childrenâ€ ™ I am deeply offended and concerned by Senator Ted Cruzâ€
™ s plan to â€œintensify surveillance of Muslim neighborhoodsâ€
� .
I live in one of the neighborhoods that he would want to target : the South Bay area of Los Angeles .
I have been residing in my community for 25 years .
I am a Muslim woman , an immigrant from Pakistan and a mother of three children .
I have been a citizen of this country for 20 years .
Since 9/11 we have seen intense scrutiny of my community and harassment of my family members .
My husband drives a taxi in Los Angeles and on numerous occasions has been subjected to discriminatory and racist language .
Last year my son was travelling on a buddy pass on United Airlines and was treated rudely and in a demeaning way by the gate agent .
My children are all born in the United States .
I worry about their future , but comments by our leaders and potential future presidents worry me the most .
I especially fear for what will happen to my children if Senator Cruz or people like him become the president of United States .
Shame on him .
Cruz claims his intention is to represent all people in the United States yet he sends a message of hate and suspicion of a whole community that is peaceful and law - abiding .
Saeed Ahmed Khan , Detroit , Michigan : â€˜Muslims in metropolitan Detroit are used to demonization and defamationâ€ ™ The Detroit area , where I am from , is home to a diverse , 100,000-strong Muslim community .
Along with Dearborn , there is also Hamtramck , the first and only American city with a Muslim - majority elected city council .
Muslims reside in every zip code , every suburb of this metropolis , working , studying and interacting with their neighbors , as they have for several decades .
Truth matters , and here is some for Mr Cruz : there has not been a single known case of an Isis recruit coming from the Metro - Detroit area .
His call for police surveillance is as superfluous as it is bigoted .
The police do come to the Muslim community â€ “ not for prosecution or persecution , but for cooperation , consultation and collaboration .
True civic engagement , through trust and mutual respect , between law enforcement and citizens is known to work .
But it is a formula alien to Senator Cruz , as he instills and exploits fear in the American public for political gain and ambition .
Muslims in metropolitan Detroit are used to demonization and defamation ; Ted Cruz is but the latest to smear an entire community and region .
Last year , Frank Gaffney , now one of Cruzâ€ ™ s advisers claimed that Dearborn , home to the largest concentration of Arabs outside the Middle East , was a no - go zone for non - Muslims .
That is patently not true .
The only no - go weâ€ ™ d like to see is racism , profiling and discrimination .
Yasmine Allie , Dearborn , Michigan : â€˜I live my version of the American Dreamâ€ ™
I am a 19-year - old university student who lives in Dearborn , Michigan , a city whose population is made up of roughly 40 % Arab - American Muslims .
My community members come from a variety of countries in the Middle East and belong to a variety of sects of Islam .
A part of me wants to let Cruz bring in all the law enforcement he wants just so he can see what a loving , loyal , successful and American neighborhood we are .
Yet another part of me does not want to give up my inalienable rights and freedoms just to prove what is already clear as day .
As a third generation Arab - American Muslim girl , I grew up watching Saturday morning cartoons , going to ballet class and eating TV dinners .
I live my version of the American dream â€ “ the same dream that brought my great - grandparents to America .
When they came , they were promised protection , equality and security under the law of the land , something that was not offered in their home land .
Three generations later and a potential commander - in - chief is abusing that same law system to make me feel violated , shunned and unwelcome in my own home .
Rather than feeling protected , I feel now as if I am what people need protection from .
If my great grandparents were still here , I wonder what they would feel .
Probably just what I do : disappointment ."
2016-03-28,"Kicking off the first week that we can remember where we arenâ€ ™ t anticipating a presidential primary debate , nominating contest or caucus , Monday was still plenty busy , with palace intrigue in the Donald Trump campaign joined by continued fallout from the billionaireâ€ ™ s online feud with fellow candidate Ted Cruz .

â€œMy views are not playground views , â€ � replied Trump .
Temperatures will already be running hot at the possibly - contested Republican National Convention in July , but no one will be packing heat , after Secret Service ruled that guns are banned .
A petition with 45,000 signatures and counting called on event organizers to allow people to carry guns .
Ohio is an open - carry state , but the venue , the Quicken Loans Arena , bans all firearms .
Only law enforcement would be allowed to carry gun , said the Secret Service spokesman .
â€œIndividuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint , regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event , â€ � spokesman Robert Hoback said .
Dana Scavino , social media director for Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , is fanning the flames of the unsupported conspiracy theory that rival Cruz has engaged in a physical relationship with his former communications director .
Stephanie Cegielski , former communications director for the Make American Great Again super - PAC was once Trumpâ€ ™ s top strategist .
And then she defected .
In an article written for xoJane , Cegielski declares that Trump is unfit for office - and writes that the original goal of his candidacy was nothing more than a protest against presumptive nominee Jeb Bush .
Hillary Clinton had a message for Republicans bemoaning the rise of Trump : â€œYou reap what you sowâ€ � .
In a speech on Monday , the former secretary of state blamed Republican obstructionism aimed at thwarting President Obama as the root cause of the real estate developerâ€ ™ s incendiary campaign .
â€œDonald Trump didnâ€
™ t come out of nowhere , â€ � Clinton said in a speech at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
â€œWhat Republicans have sown with their extremist tactics , theyâ€ ™ re now reaping with Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy .
Once you make the extreme normal , you open the door to even worse , â€ � she added .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for tonight - check in tomorrow , the next day and every day after that for up - to - the - minute political news from our team of campaign reporters , filing around the country .
A viral Change.org petition that calls the firearm ban at the Quicken Loans Arena , which is hosting the convention , â€œa direct affront to the Second Amendmentâ€ � has collected more than 40,000 signatures , including more than 9,000 in the last 24 hours .
In Ohio , the open carry of a legally possessed gun is fully lawful , but individual businesses can ban weapons from their premises if they so choose .
The Quicken Loans Arena explains on its website that â€œin accordance with the Ohioâ€ ™ s â€˜concealed carryâ€ ™ law and the right for private entities to ban handguns on their premises , firearms and other weapons of any kind are strictly forbidden on the premisesâ€ � .
But the petition author , using the username â€œThe Hyperationalistâ€ � , said of this policy that â€œwithout the right to protect themselves , those at the Quicken Loans Arena will be sitting ducks , utterly helpless against evil - doers , criminals or others who wish to threaten the American way of lifeâ€ � .
Many appear to believe the post and its hyperbolic rhetoric was intended to be satire .
According to Change.org , the signers of the petition are more likely to have signed gun violence prevention petitions than the average user , and are â€œoverwhelminglyâ€ � leftwing , pro - Democrat and pro - Bernie Sanders , based on other petitions those users have engaged with .
â€œThis takes something that Republicans daily refer to as sound principles and makes them live by it , â€ � said Ladd Everitt , a spokesperson for the Coalition to End Gun Violence .
The organization , which opposes unregulated open - carry , tweeted a link to the petition twice Monday morning .
â€œBut I donâ€ ™ t honestly want to see guns carried into that convention because I think people would die , â€ � Everitt said .
Fidel Castro has responded to Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s historic trip to Cuba with a lengthy and scornful letter that recounts the history of US aggression against Cuba and reasserts its independence with a warning to the American leader that â€œwe donâ€ ™ t need the empire to give us any presents.â€
�
The 1,500-word letter published in state media , titled â€œBrother Obamaâ€ � , was Castroâ€ ™ s first response to the presidentâ€ ™ s three - day visit last week , in which the American president said he had come to bury the two countriesâ€ ™ history of cold war hostility .
Speaking in Havana , Obama said it was time for the two countries to look forward â€œas friends and as neighbours and as family , togetherâ€ � .
But in his letter Castro dismisses
Obamaâ€ ™ s comments as â€œhoney - coatedâ€ � and said that Cubans â€œran the risk of having a heart attack on hearing these words from the president of the United Statesâ€ � .
Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia said on Monday he will veto a religious freedom bill that critics say condones discrimination against LGBT people .
The proposed law would allow individuals and groups to refuse to conduct business with anyone whose marriage they believe violates their religious beliefs .
It would also overrule existing anti - discrimination protections in local governments .
â€œI do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith - based community in Georgia , â€ � Deal said on Monday , saying it was a community he and his family â€œhave been a part of for all of our livesâ€ � .
Deal , a Republican , rejected the proposal amid criticism from the public and prominent Georgia businesses .
â€œI have examined the protections that this bill proposes to provide to the faith - based community and I can find no examples of any of those circumstances occurring in our state , â€ � he said .
Three people , backed by civil liberties groups , have filed a federal lawsuit against North Carolinaâ€ ™ s sweeping new LGBT discrimination law , which the plaintiffs say violates the constitution .
Governor Pat McCrory last week signed into law a bill that blocks local governments from enacting laws with anti - discrimination protections for LGBT people and requires transgender people to use bathrooms that match with their biological sex , even if doing so violates their gender identity .
House Bill 2 ( HB2 ) was shuttled through the state government in one day , inspiring a protest from Democratic lawmakers and ensuring a swift response from civil liberties groups despite the Easter weekend .
The federal lawsuit was announced on Sunday night .
â€œBy singling out LGBT people for disfavored treatment and explicitly writing discrimination against transgender people into state law , â€ � the lawsuit said , â€œHB2 violates the most basic guarantees of equal treatment and
the US constitution.â€ � Looks like a rough night on Sean Hannity for Texas senator Ted Cruz ...
Hillary Clinton had a message for Republicans bemoaning the rise of Donald Trump : â€œYou reap what you sowâ€ � .
In a speech on Monday , the former secretary of state blamed Republican obstructionism aimed at thwarting President Obama as the root cause of the real estate developerâ€ ™ s incendiary campaign .
â€œDonald Trump didnâ€
™ t come out of nowhere , â€ � Clinton said in a speech at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
â€œWhat Republicans have sown with their extremist tactics , theyâ€ ™ re now reaping with Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy.â€ � â€œOnce you make the extreme normal , you open the door to even worse , â€ � she added .
In the speech , Clinton asked voters to consider â€ “ â€œas scary as it might beâ€
�
â€ “ who Trump might pick to fill the supreme court vacancy left by the death of justice Antonin Scalia in February .
The president has nominated judge Merrick Garland , but Republican leadership in the Senate has refused to grant him a hearing .
Clinton singled out Senate judiciary chair Chuck Grassley of Iowa , who - along with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky - has committed to keeping Garland from having a hearing .
Republicans have argued that the next president should replace Scalia on the bench .
Clinton quoted Grassley , who has said that allowing Obama to pick the nominee is in effect denying voters a voice in shaping the supreme court .
â€œAs
one of the more than 65 million Americans who voted to re - elect Barack Obama , Iâ€ ™
d say my voice is being ignored , â€ � Clinton argued .
â€œIâ€ ™ m adding my voice to the chorus asking Senator Grassley to step up and do his job .
He should hold a hearing.â€
�
In the speech , Clinton articulated why she believed Democrats should make the supreme court vacancy a voting issue , noting that the next president will likely may two or three more additional nominations to the bench during the next four years .
Clinton invoked the seminal 1965 supreme court case Griswold v Connecticut , that effectively decided a womanâ€ ™ s right to use birth control .
A young high school student at the time , Clinton said the case underscored the role the nationâ€ ™ s highest court played in expanding â€ “ or restricting â€ “ the rights of Americaâ€ ™ s most vulnerable and marginalized people .
â€œFor a long time now
the ideological bent of the court has led our country in the wrong direction , stacking the deck in favor of the wealthy and powerful , â€ � Clinton said .
She promised to appoint justices who would expand civil and human rights , and cited the supreme courtâ€ ™ s role in legalizing same - sex marriage .
â€œI will appoint justices ... who will protect a womanâ€ ™ s right to choose , rather than billionairesâ€ ™ right to buy elections , â€ � she pledged .
Clinton is campaigning in Wisconsin ahead of the stateâ€ ™ s primary on 5 April , where she will try to end her opponent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders hot streak .
The senator has picked up momentum after winning five out of the last six Democratic nominating contests .
His string of victories over the weekend has erupted into a testy exchange between the Democratic rivals over whether Sanders has a viable path forward .
On Monday , the campaigns held dueling press calls on the matter .
â€œWhile Hillary Clinton is the clear frontrunner
â€
¦ she has emerged as a weak frontrunner , â€ �
Sandersâ€ ™ strategist Tad Devine told reporters on a conference call on Monday .
Hours later , Clintonâ€ ™ s top strategist , Joel Benenson , told reporters that former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s lead was â€œnearly insurmountableâ€ � and that there â€œsimply is not enough real estate leftâ€ � for Sanders to close the pledged - delegate gap .
Bernie Sanders has gone on an astounding run in the Democratic presidential race in the last week .
In five out of the last six states to vote , nearly three out of every four voters have selected the Vermont senator over Hillary Clinton .
â€œWe believe we have a path to victory , â€ �
Sanders strategist Tad Devine told reporters on a conference call on Monday .
â€œWhile Hillary Clinton is the clear frontrunner
â€
¦ she has emerged as a weak frontrunner.â€ �
But have Sandersâ€ ™ s chances of grasping the nomination improved appreciably with his big wins out west ?
Even setting aside the former secretary of stateâ€
™ s lead among superdelegates â€ “ party elites who can vote
however they choose â€ “ the relatively small number of pledged delegates at stake in the recent state contests means Sanders did not actually gain much ground .
He won a total of 128 delegates in Arizona , Idaho , Utah , Alaska , Hawaii and Washington combined , to Clintonâ€ ™ s 75 .
That puts Clinton on 1,712 delegates including 469 superdelegates , while Sanders has 1,004 , including 29 superdelegates .
A total of 2,383 are needed to win the nomination .
Sanders , however , is claiming momentum , and his campaign points to more than$4 m in donations that have poured in since Saturday .
In fact , given certain ideal conditions â€ “ including a herd shift among those superdelegates â€ “ Sanders still has a chance to win the nomination , if he can do at least three things .
The US government has dropped its court fight against Apple after it successfully pulled data from the iPhone of San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook , according to court records .
The development effectively ends a six - week legal battle that was poised to shape digital privacy for years to come .
Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing Monday evening that they no longer needed Appleâ€ ™ s help in getting around the security countermeasures on Farookâ€ ™ s device .
â€œThe government has now successfully accessed the data stored on Farookâ€ ™ s iPhone and therefore no longer requires the assistance from Apple Inc , â€ � the government said .
It then asked the court to vacate a 16 February court order demanding Apple create software that weakened iPhone security settings to aid government investigators .
The Guardian has reported that the technique used by the government has been classified .
Stephanie Cegielski , former communications director for the Make American Great Again super - PAC was once billionaire Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s top strategist .
And then she defected .
In an article written for xoJane , Cegielski declares that Trump is unfit for office - and writes that the original goal of his candidacy was nothing more than a protest against presumptive nominee Jeb Bush .
Some highlights : â€œThe Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12 % and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50 % .
His candidacy was a protest candidacy.â€ � â€œThe exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director .
She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasnâ€ ™ t invited to the party.â€
� â€œHe certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House , but his ego has now taken over the driverâ€ ™ s seat , and nothing else matters .
The Donald does not fail .
The Donald does not have any weakness .
The Donald is his own biggest enemy.â€ � â€œMany people are not aware of the Trump campaignâ€ ™ s internal slogan , but I will tell you .
It is stolen from a make - believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet .
The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartletâ€ ™ s staff was â€˜Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.â€ ™ Inside the Trump camp , the slogan became
â€˜Let Trump Be Trump.â€
™ â€ �
The whole piece is more than worth a read .
Tourists visiting the US Capitol in Washington DC described a tense situation after shots were fired inside the visitors center .
There was confusion in early accounts about what occurred , but police said a suspect was taken into custody with wounds after shots were fired .
Police said the suspect was taken to hospital .
The officer did not identify or describe the suspect and he added that there were no additional suspects .
Ivanka Trump , daughter of the real estate magnate , has dedicated much of her professional life to the family business , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Megan Carpentier .
Will his race for the White House help or hurt her ?
Ivanka Trump , like her friend Chelsea Clinton , doesnâ€ ™ t like the press very much .
Perhaps thatâ€ ™ s understandable coming from the daughter of Donald Trump , who grew up with outrageous headlines targeting her father hitting the newsstands with alarming regularity .
One of them â€ “ a quote from his
then mistress Marla Maples â€ “ spelled â€œTHE BEST SEX
I
EVER
HADâ€
� .
In a 2007 interview with GQ , Ivanka described the media at that time as â€œvicious and brutalâ€ � , as she recounted being accosted by photographers outside theexclusive all - girls Chapin school in Manhattan .
One of them asked her for a comment on whether it was true that her father was good in bed .
She was nine .
â€œIt taught me not to trust anyone , â€ �
she said .
â€œYou can never let your guard down , and I never really have since that time.â€ �
In a press conference , Capitol police chief Matthew Verderosa said that based on the preliminary investigation , the incident was believed to be that â€œact of single person who has frequented Capitol grounds before and
[ we have ] no reason to believe that this is anything more than a criminal actâ€ � .
A female bystander suffered minor injuries and was transported to hospital , Verderosa said .
The shooter , a long male , is currently undergoing surgery and his condition is unknown .
The shooting , which occurred in the Capitol visitors center , an underground entrance to the Capitol building for tourists , sowed panic in Washington on a pleasant spring day .
How , exactly , does a â€œBrooklyniteâ€ � campaign ?
Thatâ€ ™ s the question Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s chief campaign strategist seemed to beg after tweeting that the former senator and secretary of state will campaign in New York
â€œlike a senator , â€ � unlike rival Bernie Sanders , who will campaign like a ...
well : Joel Beneson appears to have forgotten that Clintonâ€ ™ s national campaign headquarters is in the heart of Brooklyn - and that insulting a borough of 2.6 million people might not be the best way to win the hearts of some of the countryâ€ ™ s most liberal voters .
Beneson later tweeted that â€œBrooklyniteâ€ � was a term of affection from a fellow outer - borougher : Dana Scavino , social media director for billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , is fanning the flames of the unsupported conspiracy theory that rival Ted Cruz has engaged in a physical relationship with his former communications director .
His tweet links to a conspiracy video that purports to â€œproveâ€ � that Amanda Carpenter , a former Cruz campaign staffer , and the Texas senator were engaged in an affair .
The â€œproofâ€ � ?
Carpenter said on Twitter that Cruz was in a â€œfunâ€ � mood one day .
Carpenter has gone on the record calling allegations that she and the senator had anything more than a professional relationship â€œcategorically false.â€ � More on the shooting at the Capitol ...
The shelter in place order has been lifted , though the visitors center remains closed and the Capitol is only open for official business .
Capitol Police said chief Matthew Verderosa would hold a press conference at 4:15pm .
Washington was filled with tourists taking advantage of their Easter vacation while few members of Congress were even in the city as no votes were scheduled for this week .
Police blocked off the streets around the Capitol with armed officers holding submachine guns standing in the intersections to ward off sightseers .
The lockdown also applied to the White House , where Secret Service agents closed off the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House as well as Lafayette Square .
The area , a magnet for tourists and lunching office workers , was left with only police tape and agents in bulletproof vests on the sunny spring afternoon .
Bryan Sanders , a man who was punched in the face at a Donald Trump rally in Tucson , Arizona , last week , writes that the man who hit him should be held responsible for his actions - but that the violent rhetoric against peaceful protest starts with Trump himself : I donâ€
™ t bear Tony Pettway , the man who sucker - punched me when I was peacefully protesting at a Donald Trump rally in Tucson last week , any ill will .
I think he was just caught up in the moment .
I wouldnâ€ ™ t want anything to happen to him ; his career in the air force is already going to be messed up .
What happened to me is a tragedy that comes straight from Donald Trump .
He created the situation where people come and protest at his rallies because of what he says ; he tells his supporters that â€œin the old days the protester would be taken out on a stretcherâ€ � .
He says that heâ€ ™ d like to punch a protester in the face .
He offers to pay the legal bills of somebody who punches a protester .
Pettway is responsible for his own actions , but itâ€ ™ s Trumpâ€ ™ s violent , hateful message that is creating this situation .
In a way , what happened afterwards was worse .
By the Sunday after the rally , I woke up with these crazy viral stories about me online .
I had messages of support from around the world , but also immense amounts of hate and lies being spread about me .
Trump had lied about me on George Stephanopoulosâ€ ™ show on ABC after the protest .
He said I was a professional agitator , and the rightwing blogosphere immediately followed it with a half - dozen articles .
They said I must have used a racial slur to incite Pettway to hit me .
They said I assaulted him first â€ “ despite the clear video evidence that I did not .
They said endless things about me ; that I was a plant of George Soros , or the Bernie Sanders campaign , or the Hillary Clinton campaign .
None of those things are true .
One Capitol police officer has been shot and a shooter is in custody , US officials have told the Associated Press .
The US Capitol was placed on lockdown and all staff ordered to shelter in place after reports of gunshots being fired in the Capitol visitors center , police said on Monday afternoon .
The US Capitol police shut down the entire Capitol complex due to a â€œpotential security threatâ€ �
following reports of gunfire , according to an alert emailed to Capitol staff .
The alert states that no one will be allowed to enter or exit the buildings though people are allowed to move within the buildings and underground between buildings .
The police warned those outside to seek cover .
The lockdown also applied to the White House where Secret Service agents closed off the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House as well as Lafayette Square .
The area , a magnet for tourists and lunching office workers , was left with only police tape and agents in bulletproof vests on the sunny spring afternoon .
Congress is in recess , with few lawmakers in Washington .
Update :
Capitol police now say that previous reports of a police officer having been shot were inaccurate - the shooter himself was the only person seriously injured .
One Capitol Police officer has been shot and the shooter is now in custody , according to AP .
Capitol Hill and the White House are currently in lockdown because of this reported shooting .
As the AP reports : The U.S. Capitol Police are telling staff in the Capitol complex to shelter in place after a report of gunshots being fired in the Capitol Visitors Center . ...
The situation was apparently contained to the Visitors Center but no further information was immediately available .

â€œSecret Service is going to have principal decision making , â€ � said Cruz .
The â€œlawsuitâ€ � threatened by Donald Trump on Twitter over the weekend against the Louisiana Republican Party , will be a challenge in the RNC Committee on Contests .
Top Trump aide Barry Bennett clarified that the campaign will not seek litigate the matter , which is likely non - justiciable and instead go through the RNCâ€ ™ s internal process for fights over delegates .
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that despite Trumpâ€ ™ s win of the popular vote in the Pelican State , supporters of Texas senator Ted Cruz had captured control of the delegation through internal maneuvering .
Both Trump and Cruz won 18 delegates apiece in the stateâ€ ™ s March 5 primary while Marco Rubio won five delegates and the remaining five delegates are unbound free agents .
Ted Cruz just spoke with reporters in Wisconsin about terrorism , jobs and his ongoing quibbles with Donald Trump .
The Texas Senator claimed that he would destroy ISIS .
â€œJihadists across the globe , your day of reckoning is coming , â€ � said Cruz .
He said jobs was his biggest campaign issue , bringing back jobs to the US and driving wages up .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to see people coming out of school with 2,3,4 job opportunities .
Thatâ€ ™ s what this election is about .
And Cruz slammed Trump for retweeting a disparaging comment about his wife last week .
â€œNo candidate should be doing what Donald Trump did last week which was attacking my wife and attacking my family , â€ � said Cruz .
â€œLet me get an answer from the American peopleâ€ ¦ who cares ?
Who cares what Donald Trump is tweeting at night ?
Kasichâ€ ™ s campaign strategist John Weaver tweeted even more detail about the Kasich campaign changing its radio buy in Wisconsin , since many on social media immediately took it to mean that the Ohio governor was dropping out of the race .
Instead , Weaveer says more money is being spent in specific key congressional districts , since both New York and Wisconsin are winner - take - all states when it comes to delegates .

Itâ€ ™ s currently unknown which pranksters erected the stone tribute
- it shows Trumpâ€ ™ s actual birth year - but the Parks Department had removed it by Sunday evening .
John Kasich is hosting a town hall at West Salem , Wisconsin at 1 pm CT , and the crowd is already filling up .

Jill Abramson , the former executive editor of The New York Times , is now an official political columnist for The Guardian .
While sheâ€ ™ s already been writing semi - regularly for the last few months , todayâ€ ™ s piece on Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s honesty kicks of her new column , which will run every two weeks .
I would be â€œdead richâ€ � , to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase , if I could bill for all the hours
Iâ€ ™ ve spent covering just about every â€œscandalâ€ � that has enveloped the Clintons .
As an editor Iâ€ ™ ve launched investigations into her business dealings , her fundraising , her foundation and her marriage .
As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater .
Iâ€ ™ m not a favorite in Hillaryland .
That makes what I want to say next surprising .
Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy .
The yardsticks I use for measuring a politicianâ€ ™ s honesty are pretty simple .
Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics , Iâ€ ™ ve looked for connections between money ( including campaign donations , loans , Super Pac funds , speaking fees , foundation ties ) and official actions .
Iâ€ ™ m on the lookout for lies , scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election .
The connection between money and action is often fuzzy .
Many investigative articles about Clinton end up â€œraising serious questionsâ€ � about â€œpotentialâ€ � conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment .
Of course , she should be held accountable .
It was bad judgment , as she has said , to use a private email server .
It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees , but not corrupt .
There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor .
Read the rest here .
â€œWe have a path toward victory , â€ � declared Bernie Sanders after the weekend wins in Alaska , Hawaii and Washington .
But is that true ?
Tom McCarthy -- who has been allowed to step off the blog hamster wheel for a day -- is currently writing about the odds of Sanders nabbing the nomination after his recent gains .
Stay tuned .
This just in : Ted Cruz will appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday , his debut on the late night show .
So far , the Republicans have mainly avoided the late night shows .
Last week Sanders and Clinton both made appearances on Kimmel , with the former Secretary of State performing a pretty funny bit about mansplaining .
Clinton : â€œ[Mansplains is ] when a man explains something to a women in a patronising wayâ€ � Kimmel : â€œActually itâ€ ™ s when a man explains something to a woman in a condescending way .
But you were close.â€

More from that feisty Donald Trump interview with Wisconsin radio host Charles Sykes this morning .
Sykes said to Trump that â€œconservative women [ are ] repelled by your attitude and treatment of womenâ€ � and played the ad currently getting a lot of airtime in Wisconsin , which shows real women reading out the foul quotes Trump has said about women over the years .
â€œWomen are just going to see what Iâ€ ™ ve done .
Iâ€ ™ ve hired tremendous numbers of women , women are in the highest executive positions , I pay women in many cases more than I pay men , which is more than most people can say , â€ � said Trump .
When quizzed re Fox Newsâ€ ™ Megyn Kelly --
Trump has refused to participate in presidential debates because Kelly would be one of the interviews --
Trump said it wasnâ€ ™ t because she was a woman .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not a fan of Megyn Kelly .
Iâ€
™ m allowed to say that .
If Megyn Kelly were a man , I would be saying the exact same things about Megyn Kelly , â€ �
he said .
â€œI have been better to women than any of these candidatesâ€
¦ people have said that in terms of breaking the glass ceiling , I was a leader in it , â€ � said Trump .
It seems the GOP hot favorite was unaware that his attitudes towards women were still part of the campaign .
â€œI thought this was a dead issue until I just spoke to you , â€ � said Trump .
Hereâ€ ™ s the entire interview .
In important national news , the White House will host the 138th Egg Roll this morning , with festivities kicking off at 10.30am .
More than 35,000 people are expected .
The battle of the wives continued with Donald Trump refusing to apologize for having public spats with Ted Cruz about whose wife is prettier , during an interview with Charles Sykes , a Wisconsin radio shock jock this morning .
â€œI
didnâ€

He started it , â€ � said Trump .
â€œWow .
You realize weâ€ ™ re not on a playground and that youâ€ ™ re running for president , right?â€ � said Sykes , a well - known Cruz supporter and part of the # NeverTrump movement .
â€œMy views are not playground views , â€ � replied Trump .
New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton attacked Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s comments on the NYPD muslim monitoring program in an interview with MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe today .
The NYPD â€œdemographics unitâ€ � was a group of 14 - 16 detectives who monitored and mapped the Muslim communities in New York City with the idea of watching for possible Islamic terrorism , but nothing was ever found .
Last week Cruz called it a â€œvery successfulâ€ � anti - terror program and called for police to â€œpatrol and secureâ€ � Muslim neighborhoods .
As Bratton said this morning : That unit began to be disbanded around 2012 , 2013 .
When I came into office in 2014 , with Mayor de Blasio , there were two detectives left in that unit .
The work had been done , the unit was disbanded myself , but itâ€ ™ s been portrayed by many of the tabloids and by Senator Cruz that somehow or another by disbanding that unit , that we lost a valuable tool in the fight against terrorism .
We did not .
It was never an investigatory entity .
The chief of my intelligence unit , who was the chief under Commissioner Kelly testified of a lawsuit that the unit never developed one piece of actionable intelligence .
So , thereâ€ ™ s a misrepresentation thatâ€ ™ s been played over and over again and that Senator Cruz in his lack of knowledge of what works here in New York , once again reiterated his attack on this city .
Bratton noted that the program greatly affected relationships with police in Muslim communities and now the need to rebuild that fractured relationship is on par with the NYPD and African - American communities in the city . ...
what weâ€ ™ re attempting to do is repair damaged relationships with that Muslim community that had been damaged for a period of time , because it was felt we were spying on them , that we were trying to intimidate them , that we were not concerned with their concerns .
Weâ€ ™ ve learned with the past .
Itâ€ ™ s much as the issues weâ€ ™ ve had with African - American communities over these many generations , that you can not police a community without effectively working with them .
Last week reporter Jamiles Lartey headed out to Bay Ridge , Brooklyn to report on how monitoring of Muslim communities is still going on .
â€œItâ€
™ s just part of growing up Muslim in New York , â€ � said Faisal , a 17-year - old Bay Ridge resident .
Happy Monday and welcome to the Guardianâ€ ™ s live coverage of the 2016 election campaign .
This week there is a tiny little breather .
CNNâ€ ™ s Anderson Cooper will , however , host a Republican town hall meeting in Wisconsin on Tuesday night .
Today Hillary Clinton will speak at the University of Washington about the problems Donald Trump could cause on the supreme court .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s David Smith will be there .
The Associated Press reports that Clinton will argue that a President Trump could reshape the court and â€œroll back the rights of individuals , further empower corporations and undo some of the nationâ€ ™ s progress.â€ � Clinton will call on Senate leaders to give Merrick Garland , Obamaâ€ ™ s pick for supreme court justice , a fair hearing , says the AP .
It was the weekend of Bernie Sanders , with the bird - taming Vermont senator enjoying massive wins in Alaska , Hawaii and Washington on Saturday .
But can Sanders catch up with her in the delegate count ?
Itâ€ ™ s â€œimprobable not impossibleâ€ � , reports Politico , noting that he would need big wins in upcoming states where Clinton is at present ahead in the polls : New Jersey , New York , California and Pennsylvania .
A street party in Brooklyn â€ “ Sandersâ€ ™ hometown â€ “ signaled the opening of Sandersâ€ ™ local headquarters on Saturday in anticipation of the April 19 primary .
The delegate count is also in focus for Republicans , with Donald Trump complaining that despite winning the state of Louisiana back on March 5 , Cruz will take more delegates .
Trump is threatening legal action .

2016-03-29,"Donald Trump attacked Wisconsin governor Scott Walker for failing to raise taxes in order to properly fund schools and roads on Tuesday , in a startling new break from rightwing orthodoxy from the Republican frontrunner .
The comments came after Walker endorsed Trumpâ€ ™ s rival , Texas senator , Ted Cruz , in the GOP race .
Walker became a conservative hero for his efforts to crush public sector unions and cut government spending in the Democratic - leaning state in Wisconsin , something that led to an attempted recall of the Wisconsin governor in 2012 and became a national cause cÃ © lÃ¨bre .
But , in a radio interview with talkshow host Michael Koolidge on Tuesday , Trump bashed Walkerâ€ ™ s administration .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a $ 2.2bn deficit and the schools were going begging and everything was going begging because he didnâ€ ™ t want to raise taxes â€
™ cause he was going to run for president , â€ � said Trump .
â€œSo instead of raising taxes , he cut back on schools , he cut back on highways , he cut back on a lot of things.â€ �
Trump also added of the Badger State in general : â€œWisconsin has a lot of problems , plus there is tremendous hatred â€
¦
I wouldnâ€
™ t exactly say that things are running smoothly.â€ � Walker , who briefly was a presidential candidate and considered a top contender for the GOP nomination , dropped out of the presidential race in September with an unheeded call for Republican rivals to consolidate around an alternative to him .
In the interview , Trump said of Walkerâ€ ™ s campaign : â€œWe sent him packing like a little boy.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s statements come just one week before Wisconsinâ€ ™ s crucial primary .
The state , which awards 42 delegates to the Republican National Convention , represents the best opportunity for the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s opponents to beat him before the campaign moves to more favorable terrain for Trump in the north - east later in April ."
2016-03-29,"Just a week before Wisconsin votes , the governor and former presidential candidate endorsed Ted Cruz , the only Republican left with a ( slim ) chance of beating Trump to the nomination .
The governor and the lobbyists â€œTo me , Iâ€ ™ m all in .
This is not a default , â€ � Walker pealed in his ringing endorsement .
â€œTed Cruz is in the best position by far to win the nomination of the Republican party.â€ �
Trump berates Walker for not raising taxes The Democratic candidates turned to Wisconsin and New York , where an aide to Hillary Clinton said her rival , Bernie Sanders , will â€œcampaign like a Brooklynite , and sheâ€ ™ s going to campaign like a senatorâ€ � .
Is â€˜campaign like a Brooklyniteâ€ ™ an insult ?
â€œThere was a price if you said one thing and then did something completely different , â€ � Obama told reporters on Monday night .
â€œThe question is , in the current media environment , is that still true?â€ �
John Kerry : elections â€˜embarrassâ€ ™ US
The death of Antonin Scalia left the eight justices tied on whether to gut the power of public unions , something the late conservative very much wanted to do .
Republicans still donâ€
™ t want to confirm Obamaâ€ ™ s nominee .
Scaliaâ€ ™ s absence resonates in ruling But cracks in Republican opposition to a successor are starting to show : three senators have called for hearings , and more than a dozen have said theyâ€ ™ ll meet the nominee .
Merrick Garland , the piÃ±ata nominee Florida police charged Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , with assaulting a reporter at a rally this month .
They released footage of the incident , too .
Denial , video and denial again"
2016-03-30,"Tonight , the remaining three Republican candidates for president â€ “ Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and John Kasich â€ “ took the stage in Milwaukee , Wisconsin for a CNN - run town hall .
The real star of the night , however , might have been a man who wasnâ€ ™ t even physically on the stage â€ “ Corey Lewandowski , the campaign manager for Donald Trump .
Earlier in the day , Lewandowski was charged with the battery of Michelle Fields , a former Breitbart News reporter , at a Trump event in Florida earlier in March .
Lewandowski has vigorously denied that an assault took place , at one point apparently claiming that he never touched Fields and had never even met her before .
Despite the charges , and footage that appears to show Lewandowski grabbing her arm , Trump has stood behind his campaign manager .
The Lewandowski assault charges dominated cable news coverage , so it shouldnâ€ ™ t come as a surprise that the very first question Anderson Cooper asked Ted Cruz wasnâ€ ™ t about the endorsement he received from Wisconsin governor Scott Walker â€ “
it was about Lewandowski .
In response to the question about whether or not Cruz would ask Lewandowski to resign in light of the charges , the Texas senator replied , â€œof course , itâ€ ™ s not complicated â€ “ members of the campaign shouldnâ€ ™ t be assaulting the pressâ€ � .
Cruz went further , clearly sensing an opportunity in his effort to derail Trump , echoing a statement from his campaign earlier in the day , saying that Lewandowskiâ€ ™
s behavior was â€œconsistent with a pattern of the [ Trump ] campaign ...
Itâ€ ™ s been insults , personal attacks , and going to the gutter.â€ �
It wasnâ€ ™ t just Ted Cruz who started off with a question about Lewandowski â€ “ Kasich was asked whether he would fire him .
While Kasich said he hadnâ€ ™ t seen the video , he said he would â€œabsolutelyâ€ � fire him .
Trump then got the same first question as Cruz and Kasich .
Asked whether his campaign manager would continue , Trump emphatically stated , â€œyes , he will , I looked at the tapeâ€ � .
Trump is clearly making a strategic gamble when it comes to his campaign manager , doubling down on his support for Lewandowski despite the overwhelming negative reaction from the mainstream media and from many conservative thought leaders .
Cooper didnâ€
™ t let Trump off the hook easily , saying that Lewandowski had claimed at one point that he never touched her , but that the tape appeared to show he did .
So did his campaign manager mislead him ?
Trumpâ€
™ s response : â€œNo.â€
�
Trump was clearly prepared for the Lewandowski line of questioning .
The usually off - the - cuff candidate pulled papers out of his suit pocket with the exact quote that Fields gave after the alleged assault .
Trump mockingly read the Fieldsâ€ ™ words , doing his best to make her comments seem melodramatic and then claiming that she had grabbed him and that Lewandowski was only separating her from him .
When Anderson asked Trump whether his opponents were right that this incident said something about Trumpâ€ ™ s leadership , the Republican frontrunner defended his decision to keep Lewandowski : â€œI am a loyal person ... it would be so easy just to terminate him , to say â€˜youâ€ ™ re firedâ€ ™ ...
I stick up for people ...
She had a pen in her hand , which could have been a knife ...
I donâ€
™ t want to ruin this manâ€ ™ s
life.â€
�
The real question is whether any of this will actually matter â€ “ will it move the needle with voters ?
In any other year , a presidential candidateâ€ ™ s decision to stand behind a male campaign manager accused of assaulting a female reporter would be considered a political kiss of death .
This year , however , Donald Trump has defied and , indeed , rewritten the rules .
Trump has survived â€ “ even thrived â€ “ after his supposedly damaging comments about immigrants , POWs , women , disabled reporters , and Muslims .
Will this be any different ?
For the committed Trump supporters , who make up roughly 40 - 45 % of the GOP electorate , the answer is probably no .
While it wonâ€ ™ t hurt Trump among his incredibly devoted base , it will serve to further galvanize the anti - Trump forces
â€ “ making it even less likely that the â€œnever Trumpâ€ � crowd could be wooed back into the GOP tent if he is the nominee .
When it comes to Donald Trump , the cake is baked , and almost everything that happens â€ “ negative or positive â€
“ only serves to reinforce existing perceptions of the candidates .
It is hard to imagine that changing ."
2016-03-30,"Addressing the usual throng of press reporters earlier this month , Ted Cruz said , â€œThe mainstream media loves talking about Donald Trumpâ€ �
â€ “ a statement that was instantly relayed by the media , complete with a loud reference to Trump in the headline .
The irony doesnâ€ ™ t end there .
In the past few weeks , countless articles have wondered aloud whether too many articles are being written about Donald Trump .
Is the media to blame for Donald Trump ?
The risks of navel - gazing and delusions of grandeur are high when the media itself takes on that question .
Nonetheless , this data journalistâ€ ™ s analysis suggests there are several strong reasons to take on the question , and several strong reasons to raise doubt about the conclusion .
The stakes in the question are high ( if the media truly is to blame then perhaps we could also shape who becomes the next US president ) .
And a majority of Americans agree that the media is indeed very powerful .
Earlier this month 68 % of Americans told YouGov that they believed the mainstream media bore at least some responsibility for violence at Trump events .
Although the question is important , itâ€ ™ s still problematic .
Asking whether journalists are to blame for Trump assumes that thereâ€ ™ s something wrong with Donald Trump , his success and/or his supporters .
And the question also assumes that the media is in a position to fairly judge the media .
Iâ€ ™ ll try to minimize my own subjective bias in what follows by sticking as closely as possible to the data at hand .
Trump had the highest name recognition to begin with Media coverage , good or bad , can be helpful for someone looking to enter the White House .
Thereâ€ ™ s a pretty clear correlation between support for a candidate and simple name recognition .
Thatâ€ ™ s especially important early on in presidential campaigns when many poll respondents might be wondering â€œMarco who?â€ � .
As Clifford Zukin , a former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research , explained to NPR in August last year : â€œI think [ early polls ] measure name recognition â€ “ and
thatâ€ ™ s something , but is name recognition really the way you want to choose a presidential candidate?â€
� .
But on this measure Trump had a considerable lead on Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio or any of his other rivals right from the outset .
If Americans hadnâ€ ™ t already heard of Trump Tower , Trump Hotel or Trump Entertainment Resorts , they might well have seen Donald Trump appear on their screens while watching World Wrestling Entertainment ( he was inducted into the WWE celebrity hall of fame in 2013 ) or been one of the 28.1 million Americans to have watched Trump host the hit NBC reality show The Apprentice .
The New York billionaire was already an American cultural reference point about New York and about billionaires before he became a reference point in American politics .
When Trump announced he would be running for the presidency , the media coverage he received may well have boosted his recognition to some poll respondents .
But the fact is , most of them already knew him so itâ€ ™ s hard to argue that Trump gained a great deal from his initial press coverage .
Avoiding coverage may not mean a better outcome If the mere fact of mentioning Donald Trump could unfairly contribute to the candidateâ€ ™ s success , is the alternative to not mention him ?
Anyone ready to make such a suggestion would do well to look to Swedenâ€ ™ s recent history .
From the mid 1990s , the far - right party Sweden Democrats began to grow , but the media were reluctant to take note of what many felt was an unpalatable force in the countryâ€ ™ s politics .
Party members were excluded from political debates and banned from publishing party advertising in the media .
As one Swedish journalist Niklas Orrenius who has studied the movement for years explained , â€œMost journalists detest them , so they donâ€ ™ t write about them
seriouslyâ€ � .
That media neglect helped the party foster a narrative that they were the underdogs , willing to say the things that a â€œpolitically correct eliteâ€ � and liberally biased journalists would not or could not say .
The press realized that their strategy had been counter - productive , but the party was already mainstream .
Socialist magazine Jacobin explains : Now , media outlets across the country make sure to include the party and its platform in opinion polling , and take pains to avoid describing it as racist or xenophobic .
The audience demand for coverage of Trump is high Whatever your stance on how journalists should come up with stories , in practice , demand influences supply .
News outlets tend to publish more stories that they know people
â€
“ lots of people â€ “ want to read .
Google searches are one of the best available indications of the publicâ€ ™ s demand for information .
On Trump specifically , searches for the candidate were initially higher than the number of media articles produced about him as shown in the chart below from FiveThirtyEight .
In the interests of transparency , I asked our own audience research team about the behavior of Guardian readers .
In March , Guardian data shows that there were 30 m global page views to articles tagged with â€œDonald Trumpâ€ � compared with 15 m views on articles tagged with â€œHillary Clintonâ€ � and 12 m views about â€œBernie Sandersâ€ � .
Unfortunately , we donâ€ ™ t have numbers that control for the volume of stories about each of those candidates so understanding where those readers came from is important .
Overall , 34 % of traffic to articles about Trump came from internet searches and an additional 46 % was as a result of readers clicking on Trump articles from a Guardian homepage .
In other words , readers are seeking out content about Donald Trump and one
could argue that the media has a responsibility to provide it .
Perhaps , then , itâ€ ™ s not a question of whether the media is to blame for covering Trumpâ€ ™ s bid for the presidency , but whether the media is to blame for how they covered that bid ?
Some voters are highly resistant to fact checks â€ “ and mainstream media generally
One argument is that the media neglected to sufficiently hold Trump to account by fact - checking his various claims .
â€œWhen he says something thatâ€ ™ s patently false , start at â€˜youâ€ ™ re either lying or youâ€ ™ re completely uninformedâ€ ™ and work your way back , â€ � explains Chez Pazienza in the Daily Banter this week .
â€œHit him back .
That is , objectively , the right thing to do because youâ€ ™ re dealing in fact and he isnâ€ ™ t.â€
� The problem is , there have been a large number of online articles that have fact - checked Donald Trump on a whole range of issues , but they donâ€ ™ t seem to have slowed down the groundswell in support for the candidate .
TV journalism may have asked fewer tough questions of Trump ( a supposition thatâ€ ™ s hard to measure given that so few TV scripts are published online ) , but the speed of 24-hour news means itâ€ ™ s also practically tough for those journalists to conduct rigorous reality - checking research .
Back in 2008 , rumors began to circulate that Barack Obama was a Muslim â€ “ a claim that was often used in the context of discrediting the presidential candidate ( and thereby exposed the hostility of some Americans towards Muslims ) .
Despite being factually disproven , itâ€ ™ s a claim that many still believe .
A survey released on Tuesday by Public Policy Polling found that 52 % of Republicans still think Barack Obama is Muslim .
Among Trump supporters , that number climbed to 62 % .
Fact - checking articles have arguably done little , if anything , to change those numbers .
In statistics , we try to be watchful for â€œconfirmation biasâ€
�
â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s the human tendency to interpret numbers in a way that conveniently confirms your world view rather than challenging it .
Unfortunately confirmation bias also guides our online clicks and weâ€ ™ re all guilty of it ( Iâ€ ™ m ill - positioned to criticize Trump supporters who do not read my fact - checking articles if I refuse to be persuaded to click on their blogs claiming that Obama is a Muslim ) .
American confidence in the media is at a historic low , and thatâ€ ™ s a fact thatâ€ ™ s even more stark among the countryâ€ ™ s Republicans .
In 2015 , Gallup found that just 40 % of Americans said they had a â€œgreat dealâ€ � or â€œfair amountâ€ � of trust in the mass media .
Just 32 % of Republicans said the same .
Fact - checking articles may prove impotent in the face of such distrust .
Worse , they may actually heighten those attitudes .
In December 2015 , Rasmussen found that 47 % of likely voters think most reporters are biased against Trump â€ “ only 23 % felt that Clinton was the subject of unfair coverage .
This election has provided further evidence that media assumptions about voters are wrong Not everything can be quantified .
Those unknowns are important in understanding the real connection between the media and Trumpâ€ ™ s ascension .
We know that Trump supporters feel ignored and frustrated by the mainstream establishment .
But we donâ€ ™ t know how the initial media coverage , which ridiculed them , might have fueled those feelings .
We know that some white Americans feel that while they suffered hardship in the financial crisis , African Americans were unfairly protected by Obama .
But we donâ€ ™ t know how the media portrayal of Trump supporters as racist ( a label many of them might reject ) has further enforced the view that their grievances are not heard .
And itâ€ ™ s simply hard to measure how the fact that just 7 % of reporters identify as Republican might have affected truly objective reporting about Donald Trump .
The loaded question asked this week , â€œis the media to blame for Trump?â€ � demonstrates the dangers of the shaky assumptions that have dominated this election â€ “ assuming that Trump would probably never make it past 20 % support , assuming that Trump is one social phenomenon ( rather than a symptom of many ) and assuming that Trump supporters are simply misguided in their choice for the next American president .
The question also assumes that American opinions are flexible and that the media is playing a large role in changing those minds .
We might need to wait until this election is over and the votes are counted to see how reliable those assumptions are .

2016-04-02,"Ted Cruz detoured from campaigning in Wisconsin on Saturday to make an appearance at North Dakotaâ€ ™ s Republican convention , where presidential delegates were being picked .
He faced stiff competition from the Donald Trump campaign , however , as it heralded an impending endorsement from one of the state 's US representatives .
Convention - goers were scheduled to select 25 of their 28 national delegates on Sunday .
They will go to the national convention , in Cleveland in July , unbound to any candidate .
Local reports said Representative Kevin Cramer was working to help Trump surrogate Ben Carson meet and influence delegates .
The retired neurosurgeon briefly led Republican presidential polls before dropping out last month , and then endorsing Trump .
Later on Saturday , Trump adviser Barry Bennett told NBC News Cramer would endorse Trump on Sunday in â€œa huge winâ€
� that would â€œhelp us immenselyâ€
� with the stateâ€ ™ s delegates .
â€œWe have seen the slate and we love it ,
â€ �
NBC quoted Bennett as saying , adding : â€œIf we play our cards right we could do very well.â€
�
In his speech to the convention on Saturday , Cruz said it was â€œentirely possibleâ€
� that North Dakotan delegates could help determine the GOP nominee .
Wisconsin will vote in a keenly awaited primary on Tuesday .
Cruz has opened a healthy lead over Trump there , allowing him to spend some time in North Dakota .
Trump and Ohio governor John Kasich sent supporters to make their cases for delegatesâ€ ™ backing .
Trump leads the race over Cruz but is not certain to reach the total number of delegates at which the convention becomes uncontested .
Kasich , who is far behind , is pinning his hopes on such an open convention in his home state .
Cruz earned an ovation in his speech to the North Dakota convention , when he said North Dakota had become â€œa powerful energy havenâ€ � and promised to keep the federal government â€œthe heck out of the wayâ€ � ."
2016-04-02,"Senator Ted Cruz has a secret .
You can tell because he slows down as heâ€ ™ s about to tell it â€ “ as he did on Friday night in Wisconsin , when talking about the governorâ€ ™ s union - busting law , Act 10 , which limited the rights of public sector unions to collectively bargain and sparked an unsuccessful recall effort .
â€œThe courage and principle that Scott Walker and the people of Wisconsin demonstrated in that fight , over and over and over again â€ ¦
â€ � he began .
He dropped his voice and slowed the sentence , inviting listeners to lean forward and catch the unexpected ending :
â€œâ€ ¦ is exactly the courage and principle we need in Washington DC to turn this country around.â€
�
Well , maybe it wasnâ€ ™ t a secret â€ “
but it was a rhetorical trick to sound like a secret that Cruz used repeatedly , like any good debate - club veteran .
And the Cruz - inclined crowd at the Milwaukee Republicansâ€ ™ event , gathered at the American Serb Hall , ate it up with the cole slaw , mashed potatoes and vast quantities of tartar sauce at the worldâ€ ™ s largest weekly fish fry .
Seated at communal tables , the crowd of 750 had , by the time Cruz entered the room , already been treated to a history lesson from John Kasich , one of his rivals , and a political speech disguised as a bedtime story from Sarah Palin , a former governor of Alaska and surrogate for his other rival , Donald Trump .
There was no doubt , though , that Cruz was the main event : he had a local conservative radio host and the governor , popular here
â€ “ if not around Wisconsin â€ “ to warm up the crowd for him .
The banquet hall was the largest room the local Republican leaders had ever needed for their regular election - year event
â€ “ they had to call the state party to handle the surprising sellout crowd and the national media interest .
â€œWe anticipate and always hope that Wisconsin will always have its say in the election , â€ � explained Rick Baas , communications director for the Republican party of Milwaukee County .
â€œSometimes we do , and sometimes we donâ€ ™ t .
This time weâ€ ™ re going to have a lot to say , â€ � he added , referring to a primary race that has gone on longer than anyone would have anticipated .
Attendees paid $ 40 a plate ( and an open bar ) , but the high price of the meal did not seem to bother many of the fiscally conservative , pro - tax cuts crowd .
The party activists were not broadly disposed toward a contested convention , though former governor Tommy Thompson , who introduced Kasich , warned them that it was coming regardless of how they voted on Tuesday .
Nor did the folks who sang along to both the national anthem and God Bless America seem particularly enthusiastic about the absentee Trump or his surrogate Palin .
Few people lined up to pick up Trump yard signs , and Palinâ€ ™ s speech garnered only polite applause .
â€œI would think that if you wanted the votes , you would show up , â€ �
Baas said when asked about his Trumpâ€ ™ s absence and the last - minute addition of Palin .
â€œWhen
I was running for office , I went everywhere
I was running.â€
�
Palinâ€ ™ s tepid reception contrasted with cheers for Cruz and Kasich , and even her tongue - in - cheek call for candidates to pledge their support for a former Green Bay Packerâ€ ™ s induction to the Football Hall of Fame fell flat .
The biggest reaction her speech provoked came when she said â€œonly Trump talks rationallyâ€ � about foreign policy .
A few loud laughs broke out from the back .
Still , she gamely kept on keepinâ€ ™ on .
She called Republicansâ€ ™ support for free trade policies a â€œnonsensical ideologyâ€ � , suggested that they amounted to â€œtrade surrenderâ€ � , and displayed a firm handle on some of the minutiae of free trade policy that might surprise her 2008-era critics .
She also criticized what she said was the liberal policy of â€œinducing and seducingâ€ � undocumented immigrants to come to the US , â€œwith gift basketsâ€ � of â€œteddy bears and soccer ballsâ€
� , an apparent reference to the 10,000 unaccompanied children a month who came across the US border in 2014 .
Even a reference to Clintonâ€ ™ s role in Benghazi , a popular topic for other speakers , earned her only a smattering of applause .
Near the end of her speech , the audience rose to its feet to politely applaud her before sheâ€ ™ d actually finished .
Kasich , low - key by comparison , opened his speech by acknowledging that 38 % of Wisconsin Republicans have no idea who he is .
He won plenty of applause for his heavily autobiographical speech , particularly when he brought up the importance of tax cuts and his plan to return control of education and healthcare policies , among others , to the states .
Some of his supporters in the crowd , who waved signs as he took and then left the stage , even zig - zagged through the maze of tables to try to get selfies with the governor .
But for nearly every one of Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign promises â€ “ repeal Obamacare , enact a flat tax , abolish the IRS , rein in the EPA , reduce regulations on small businesses , increase military spending , end the rules of engagement for US troops serving abroad , and realize a â€œday of reckoningâ€ � for â€œjihadistsâ€ � on his eventual inauguration day â€ “ the crowd applauded , cheered and even whistled .
The event did not bode well for Trumpâ€ ™ s chances in the state , or at least the Milwaukee suburbs critical to Tuesdayâ€ ™ s election , though the candidate has added events in Racine , Eau Claire , West Allis and Milwaukee to his schedule .
Nor did the dinner look good for Kasich , who has to pick up more delegates here to play the role of convention spoiler for both Trump and Cruz .
But given the many times the phrase â€œconstitutional conservativeâ€ � was repeated by speakers on Friday night , the populist businessman and compassionate conservative might never really have had a chance among the party faithful ."
2016-04-02,"Forget Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rhetorical flourish , Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ idealism and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s steady hand .
The only thing that can # StopDonaldTrump isnâ€ ™ t a candidate , itâ€ ™ s a segment of the electorate â€ “ and a very particular one at that .
Women are poised to play a critically important role in the presidential election , and not just because they make up 52 % of the voters .
To understand whatâ€ ™ s happening in this election , you have to focus in on marriage , and particularly on the fact that more than ever before , women are delaying it .
As Rebecca Traister relays in her bestselling new book
All The Single Ladies , today just 20 % of Americans aged 18 to 29 are married â€ “ in 1960 that number was nearly 60 % .
That is not a bit of cultural trivia to be shared as part of conversational pleasantries between friends .
Itâ€ ™ s a profound political realization : single women tend to vote Democratic and as their ranks grow , so does their power .
In 2012 , single women made up 23 % of the electorate , driving turnout in practically every demographic of importance to Democrats â€ “ from African Americans to Latinos to young people .
This year , theyâ€ ™ re poised to make up an even larger proportion , 24 % to 25 % , according to the Womenâ€ ™ s Voices Women Vote Action Fund .
That is very bad news indeed for Trump .
Whatever he has done right this election , he has not made a good impression on women .
A recent NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll found that 70 % of women had a negative view of Trump .
Nearly half of Republican women voting in the primary said they couldnâ€
™ t imagine supporting him .
Now , following a new slew of misogynistic remarks , those numbers are poised to get even worse .
Last week , Trump escalated a Twitter feud with Ted Cruz by suggesting Cruzâ€ ™ s wife was less attractive than his .
On Monday , after his campaign manager was formally charged with battery of a female reporter and video of the alleged assault was publicly released , Trump defended him anyway .
On Wednesday , he made what was arguably the biggest blunder of his campaign when he suggested women who seek abortions should be punished , a remark that enraged liberals and conservatives alike .
Finally , on Friday , a pro - Trump Super Pac released a positive ad aimed at female voters and featuring a woman in her kitchen , in pearls , fretting about national security .
If this is Trumpâ€ ™ s vision for women in America , he needs to update his prescription from the 1950s .
Little wonder that among the rising demographic of single women , he is losing by a landslide .
Unmarried women support Hillary Clinton by a 52 % margin .
And thatâ€ ™ s not some niche group .
As Page Gardner of Womenâ€ ™ s Voices Women Vote Action Fund put it in a call with reporters on Friday :
â€œUnmarried women are driving the election.â€
�
For the first time in history , the majority of female voters are projected to be unmarried .
And yet , in the primary season so far , the growing power of single ladies has not been as helpful to Clinton as might have been expected .
One of the great ironies for feminists this election is that despite the fact that for the first time in history a woman is well positioned to take the presidency , many women â€ “ and particularly young ones
â€ “ keep lining up behind Bernie Sanders , a 74-year - old white man .
While Clinton holds the edge with women overall , that edge doesnâ€ ™ t come anywhere close to the overwhelming support Barack Obama enjoyed with African American voters in 2008 , when he was poised to become the first African American president .
Even now , losses with younger women haunt her ; a recent poll found millennial women backed Sanders over Clinton by astonishing 61 % to 30 % .
There are many theories to explain the difference in how younger and older women respond to Clinton , ranging from what younger women may not know about office sexism to what older women may not get about the appeal of Sandersâ€ ™ youthful idealism .
Whatever the cause of the generational disconnect with women , though , Clinton may have stumbled upon the perfect solution in Trump , whom a growing number of women will go to extraordinary lengths to keep from the presidency .
( The more women know about him , the less they like him . )
One reason single women did not wield as much power as they might have in the 2014 midterm elections , when Republicans took control of the Senate , is because they largely didnâ€ ™ t show up to vote .
A motivation to stop Trump would fix that , and it would not just be good for Clinton or even Sanders : it would be good for women everywhere , as they reshape government to reflect their priorities and preserve their newfound freedoms ."
2016-04-03,"Donald Trump is braced for an electoral setback in the midwest on Tuesday , after suffering the worst week so far in his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination .
The property developer and TV host is expected to lose the Wisconsin primary to Ted Cruz , the firebrand Texas senator who is the leading hope of conservatives scrambling to stop him as part of a deepening civil war within the Republican party .
Cruz has led Trump in all polls of the state in the past week , with two surveys placing his advantage as high as 10 percentage points .
Analysts forecast that Cruz could win 39 of the potentially crucial 42 party delegates at stake in the race to the 1,237-delegate finish line .
Trumpâ€ ™
s brash style appears to have backfired among Wisconsinites , who wear their conservatism more lightly .
He has repeatedly insulted the stateâ€ ™ s governor , Scott Walker , who is popular among Republicans , boasting in an interview that he â€œsent him packing like a little boyâ€ � when Walker was among the partyâ€ ™ s presidential contenders .
Charlie Sykes , an influential conservative talk radio host in Wisconsin , said on Sunday Trump had â€œmisread the culture and misread the political landscapeâ€ � .
â€œWe value decency and civility and rationality and reasonableness , none of which is associated with Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign , â€ �
Sykes told ABC .
â€œWhen this political music man comes into Wisconsin , heâ€ ™ s actually coming into a town where we kind of see through his scam.â€ �
Asked how damaging a loss in Wisconsin would be , Trump told Fox News Sunday :
â€œIâ€ ™ d like to win it .
Is it a big setback ?
Iâ€ ™
d like to win it .
It would always be better to win.â€ � Victory for Cruz , whose unpopularity among the Republican establishment seemed unmatched until Trumpâ€ ™ s entry in the campaign , will give renewed optimism to those desperate to prevent the businessman becoming the presidential candidate .
Polls consistently indicate that Trump would be badly beaten across the country by Hillary Clinton , the former secretary of state and likely Democratic nominee .
Clinton and Bernie Sanders , the Democratic socialist senator from Vermont , also face off in the Democratic primary in Wisconsin on Tuesday .
Sanders holds a narrow lead over Clinton in the state , according to an average of recent polls .
Despair among the self - described â€œNever Trumpâ€ � ranks intensified last week as the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s campaign staggered from crisis to crisis .
In one such instance , he was sharply criticised by other Republicans for reposting a supporterâ€ ™ s unflattering photograph of Cruzâ€ ™ s wife , Heidi , to Twitter .
â€œWas this my best week ?
I guess not .
I couldâ€ ™ ve done without the retweet , â€ �
Trump told Fox .
Nationwide polls have not shown any decline in Trumpâ€ ™ s overall support , but it appears to have plateaued , at least for the moment , at around 40 % of Republicans .
Last Tuesday , Trumpâ€ ™ s pugnacious campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , was charged with battery by police in Florida , for yanking the arm of a young female reporter who was trying to ask Trump a question .
Trump continues to defend him .
Trump was even condemned by the notoriously zealous American anti - abortion movement , after telling an interviewer â€œthere has to be some form of punishmentâ€ � for women who had such procedures if abortion were illegal .
He later backtracked to the orthodox rightwing position that abortion providers , rather than patients , ought to be penalised .
On Sunday , he also backtracked on remarks from a Wisconsin rally on Saturday in which he appeared sanguine about the possibility of war between nuclear - armed North Korea and neighbours South Korea and Japan .
He had also previously spoken in favour of South Korea and Japan having nuclear weapons .
Speaking to CBS , he said : â€œThe single biggest problem the world has is nuclear .
I think if somebody gets nuclear weapons , thatâ€ ™ s a disaster.â€ �
Republicans are increasingly anticipating that their convention in Ohio in July will be bitterly contested , rather than seeing the typical coronation of a nominee who has already secured the support of a majority of the party .
Roger Stone , a Trump ally who has advised Republicans since Richard Nixon , has warned of â€œdays of rageâ€ � around the convention if the party denies Trump the candidacy .
Reince Priebus , the party chairman , stressed on Sunday that Trump could clinch the nomination by securing the required 1,237 delegates before the convention .
Trump currently has the support of 736 state delegates and Cruz 463 , according to the Associated Press .
John Kasich , the governor of Ohio , has 143 .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing can get stolen from anyone , â€ � Priebus told ABC .
He pointed out , however , that the rules governing a so - called â€œopenâ€ � convention have not yet been set for this year .
If no one wins a majority in the first round of voting , many delegates will become free to realign themselves with a different candidate ."
2016-04-04,"Ted Cruz has joined Donald Trump in attacking the â€œfevered pipedreamâ€ � of changing Republican party rules and allowing a more moderate candidate to compete against them for the presidential nomination .
In remarks to reporters on the eve of a crucial primary election in Wisconsin , the Texan senator was scathing of the idea , despite it being floated only hours earlier by the Republican National Committee chair , Reince Priebus , in an interview on Sunday .
Cruz is expected to score an important victory over Trump in the state on Tuesday , possibly winning enough delegates to stop the billionaire frontrunner from securing the nomination outright before the national convention in July .
It has led to renewed speculation that a â€œcontested conventionâ€ � could even open the door for a new , more establishment - friendly candidate such as the House speaker , Paul Ryan , to seek the nomination instead .
But Cruz sought to quash such talk quickly on Monday â€ “ suggesting both outsiders would unite to prevent the required rule change .
â€œThis fevered pipedream of Washington that at the convention they will parachute in some white knight who will save the Washington establishment , it ainâ€ ™ t gon na happen , â€ � he said .
â€œIf it did , the people would quite rightly revolt , â€ � added the maverick conservative senator , in an echo of Trumpâ€ ™ s warning of riots if the party sought to block the will of its voters .
The key hurdle for a new candidate , or even the trailing Ohio governor John Kasich , to seek the nomination through the convention process is a rule requiring them to have won eight state primaries in order to be considered .
â€œItâ€
™ s interesting that this rule that is in question was adopted in 2012 because the Washington establishment wanted to keep Ron Paul and his supporters out , â€ � said Cruz .
â€œNow that it is inconvenient they want to get rid of it , but you know what :
whatâ€ ™ s good for the goose , is good for the gander .
If you want to win , win at the ballot box.â€ �
Changing the 2012 requirement would require the GOP rules committee to vote ahead of the Cleveland convention , or during later rounds of voting , but party leaders insist the latter scenario is still possible .
â€œThat rule is a rule that was drafted by the Romney delegates of 2012 and that rule , obviously , will be reviewed by the 2016 rules committee , which will be made up mostly of Trump and Cruz delegates , and , you know , they will likely have an incentive to probably not change that rule , â€ �
Priebus told Fox News on Sunday .
â€œBut letâ€ ™ s just play out [ the ] hypothetical , â€ � added the RNC chair .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s possible [ that someone on a later ballot when most of the delegates are unbound could be nominated ] .
And at that point , if you get into a multi - ballot convention where youâ€ ™ ve got five or six or seven rounds , itâ€ ™ s possible that a person can be nominated
thatâ€ ™ s not one of the three.â€
�
Cruz insists such a scenario would deprive any nominee of legitimacy and claims only he can now unify the party against Trump .
â€œIf Washington says â€˜we have elections in 50 states , but we donâ€ ™ t like what the people have voted for and we have someone else who is going to get along and keep the cronyism goingâ€ ™ , the voters would naturally say â€˜to heck with you , weâ€ ™ re staying homeâ€ ™ ,â€ � he said .
â€œAre some folks in Washington foolish enough to do that anyway ?
Probably .
But they canâ€ ™ t do it .
If over 80 % of the delegates are Cruz delegates and Trump delegates , under what universe do a thousand [ of them ] go vote for some uber - Washington lobbyist who hasnâ€ ™ t been on the ballot .
That simply isnâ€ ™ t going to happen.â€
�
â€œThe nice thing is Washington doesnâ€ ™ t control what happens , the delegates do,,â€
� he added , during the remarks with reporters ahead of a prerecorded television â€œtown hall debateâ€ � on Monday .
â€œWe are going to arrive at the convention where 80 % of the delegates are going to be Cruz delegates or Trump delegates .
Both Donald and I have been very clear that we shouldnâ€ ™ t be changing the rules because Washington is unhappy with how the people are voting.â€ �"
2016-04-04,"Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s electoral mojo does not seem to be working on Wisconsin Republicans , who tell pollsters by about five points that they prefer the more polite scorched - earth conservatism of Ted Cruz .

elsewhere â€ ¦

2016-04-06,"Ted Cruz is so unpopular among fellow Republicans that South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham joked about murdering him in February .
But that didnâ€ ™ t stop Graham from endorsing the Texas senator in March .
Cruzâ€ ™ s emergence as the main competitor to Donald Trump has had the strange effect of turning the conservative firebrand despised by many of his colleagues into a safer pair of hands for the party .
Despite the longstanding misgivings of many in the Republican establishment about Cruz â€ “ an ambitious and grating striver whom even his allies describe as a young man in hurry â€ “ they have embraced him as the lesser of two evils , compared with Trump .
The first - time Texas senator was elected in 2012 as a Tea Party insurgent winning as an underdog against his stateâ€ ™ s longtime lieutenant governor .
Cruz quickly set about becoming a national figure by forcing a 17-day government shutdown less than nine months after his election to the Senate .
That fight made Cruz a hero to the partyâ€ ™ s conservative base but alienated colleagues who saw Cruz as pursuing a hopeless fight simply to boost his national profile .
Less than two years later , Cruz announced his candidacy for the White House at Liberty University , an evangelical college in rural Virginia .
Cruz quickly emerged from the crowded Republican candidate field by consolidating the support of many of the partyâ€ ™ s most conservative voters .
By combining sophisticated campaign operation with debate skills honed by years as a champion debater at university , the Texas senator had long been viewed as one of the most formidable of the 16 Republican candidates .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s appeal was long limited .
He has struggled to appeal to voters beyond his base and Wisconsin
was only the second state â€ “ after his home of Texas â€ “ where he got more than 30 % of the vote from voters who did not identify as evangelical .
As the Republican primary moves to states on the eastern seaboard like New York , Pennsylvania and Maryland , Cruz must continue to move beyond his Christian base .
At this stage of the campaign , however , Cruz doesnâ€ ™ t need to become the most beloved candidate running .
He just needs to convince more moderate Republicans that while ardent social conservatism may be off - putting , it could be worse .
He could be Donald Trump ."
2016-04-06,"The race for the White House looked set to enter a tumultuous phase on Wednesday as overnight stumbles by both the Republican and Democratic frontrunners in Wisconsin opened up historic opportunities to block Donald Trump during the Republican convention in July and challenge Hillary Clinton on home turf in the next stretch .
At a stage in the US presidential cycle when the primary season is typically drawing to a close , the victories in the midwest for Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders proved to be by far larger margins than expected and raised painful questions for their Republican and Democratic opponents , even if neither Trump nor Clinton is likely to be overtaken before the conventions .
Cruz eventually seized 36 of the 42 delegates on offer in Wisconsin after trouncing Trump by a 13.1percentage point margin across a Republican state primary where the winner takes most of the prize .
Sanders , meanwhile , sealed his sixth victory in a row with an even bigger 13.5-point win over Clinton â€ “ who lost every county except Milwaukee â€ “ though he ended Tuesday night with a slimmer delegate lead of 47 to 36 due to Democratic proportionality rules .
Both challengers remain substantially behind on national delegates after the primary votes so far , with Cruz trailing Trump by 517 to 743 , and Sanders with 1,027 pledged Democratic delegates compared with 1,279 for Clinton .
But signs of flagging support for Trump make it increasingly hard for him to reach the 1,237 Republican delegate milestone needed to avoid further rounds of voting at the partyâ€ ™ s Cleveland convention .
It raises the prospect of the first convention defeat for a leading candidate since the second world war .
Pressure is also now mounting on Clinton to secure the further 1,104 pledged delegates she needs from the second half of the Democratic race to avoid relying on controversial â€œsuperdelegatesâ€ � to get her over the line at the partyâ€ ™ s Philadelphia convention .
Clinton has a commanding 469 - 31 lead over Sanders among these superdelegates , mostly local party leaders who are not constrained by primary results and could theoretically change their early endorsement of her , but are more likely to remain loyal .
Yet the former secretary of state will be anxious to avoid relying on party insiders for victory â€ “ many Sanders supporters view them as damning proof of the partyâ€ ™ s unwillingness to listen ordinary voters â€
“
and she remains hopeful of winning enough pledged delegates before the convention .
Attention therefore swiftly turned on Wednesday to New York , which finds itself in the unusual position of being a crucial battleground in not just one but two party races which are normally over long before the calendar reaches this point .
Cruz and Trump quickly descended on Wednesday for a series of rallies in the Empire State , which threatens to reverse recent momentum by awarding the bulk of its 95 Republican delegates to the billionaire celebrity from Manhattan rather than the socially conservative Texan .
But the â€˜never Trumpâ€ ™ coalition is likely to pour millions of dollars into the expensive New York media market to blunt this natural advantage and keep open the increasing likelihood of a contested convention .
In the Democratic race , there were also growing signs on Wednesday of the gloves coming off in New York , as Clinton and her allies launched a series of stinging attacks on the democratic socialist from Vermont .
Top of the new strategy appeared to be an effort to paint Sanders supporters as naive , a departure from recent efforts to woo them as a part of a future coalition to defeat Trump .
â€œLook
, I think itâ€ ™ s exciting to be in effect protesting , â€ �
Clinton told interviewers on MSNBC on Wednesday morning .
â€œI
remember I did that a long time ago when I was in my 20s , and I totally get the attraction of this.â€ � The former secretary of state has appeared impatient in recent days at the continued challenge from the left , and has made clear she wants to nip Sandersâ€ ™ momentum in the bud in a state where she was senator and maintains a family home .
â€œThere is a persistent , organised effort to misrepresent my record , and I donâ€ ™ t appreciate that , and I feel sorry for a lot of the young people who are fed this list of misrepresentations , â€ �
she added in an interview with Politico .
But the tactic brought a rebuke from otherwise supportive veterans of the successful Barack Obama insurgency against her 2008 .
â€œItâ€ ™ s patronizing , â€ � warned the presidentâ€ ™ s former adviser David Axelrod .
Sanders faced more substantial questions over his plan to break up big Wall Street banks and reluctance to go beyond Obama on gun control â€ “ measures which provoked a fierce front page response to the Brooklyn - born senator in the New York Daily News on Wednesday .
â€œI think he hadnâ€ ™ t done his homework and
heâ€ ™ d been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadnâ€ ™ t really studied or understood , and that does raise a lot of questions , â€ � said Clinton , who pasted the interview in full in an email to supporters .
The Sanders campaign defended his undoubtedly awkward encounter with the New York media by pointing to clearer explanations of his position on the banks in other recent speeches .
It argues that letting shooting victims sue gunmakers would be a more disruptive alternative to more direct gun control measures , which he favours .
The Sanders campaign instead hopes the momentum and new attacks will help it continue to outraise Clinton among small donors and close the continued polling gap between them in New York .
â€œWe very much expect an unbelievable amount of attacks and negativity over the next two weeks
, â€ � the campaign wrote to supporters on Wednesday .
â€œWe are on the path to the Democratic nomination for president .
But I want to be clear :
Super Pacs and the billionaire class want to block that path in the New York primary.â€ �
If Sanders can stop Clinton from winning a majority of the 291 delegates on offer , he would still be a long way from closing the national gap â€ “
but it would raise the prospect of turning the Philadelphia convention into a battle for the soul of the party .
â€œWe are going to an open convention , â€ �
Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver insisted on CNN after the Wisconsin result .
â€œEveryone is talking about the Republicans having an open convention , but the Democrats are going to an open convention too.â€
�
What is a contested convention ?
American political conventions have become stagey , if sterile , affairs in recent decades .
Delegates and journalists typically arrive with little doubt over who will be picked as the presidential nominee and view them as pep rallies for the November general election .
This year , the Republican convention in Cleveland in July is increasingly likely to be the opposite : a wild and chaotic race to secure delegates after Donald Trump arrives short of the necessary 1,237 to secure outright victory in first round of voting .
There could even be drama among Democrats in Philadelphia , where Bernie Sanders will be seeking to argue that Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s possible reliance on party insiders to put her over the line should raise the prospect of a contested convention ."
2016-04-06,"Ted Cruz raised fresh hope of forcing Donald Trump to a contested party convention on Tuesday , beating the Republican frontrunner in a Wisconsin primary amid signs his brash campaign style may finally be turning off GOP voters .
Cruz was projected by the Associated Press to have won the important midwest showdown just over half an hour after polls closed at 8 pm CT .
As the scale of his victory across the state became clearer , the Texas conservative was estimated to have won at least 33 of the 42 delegates on offer , limiting Trump to just a handful .
In his victory speech , Cruz looked ahead to the convention in July and vowed he would win the 1,237 delegates needed â€œeither before Cleveland or at the convention in Clevelandâ€ � .
The Texas senator said : â€œTonight is a turning point [ in the Republican primary ] .
It is a rallying cry
â€
¦
We have a choice , a real choice.â€
�
And he echoed John F Kennedy in saying : â€œWisconsin lit a candle guiding the way forwardâ€ � for Republican voters in future primaries .
Hillary Clinton also stumbled on her path to the White House , losing to Bernie Sanders in a Democratic primary that marked a sixth straight win for the Vermont outsider and shows his continued appeal among voters looking for radical change .
With 99.8 % of the results in , Sanders was winning by more than 13 points , though the Democratsâ€ ™ proportional system of allocating their 86 pledged delegates will limit the impact of his victory on the national race .
Clinton had a commanding lead of 263 delegates at the start of the night .
Sandersâ€ ™ victory speech came at a rally in Laramie , Wyoming , where the campaign has its eye on the next caucus this Saturday and was in defiant mood despite the difficult mathematical challenge ahead .
â€œIf
you ignore what you hear in the corporate media , the facts are pretty clear : we have a path toward victory ,
a path toward the White House , â€ � said the visibly energised senator to excited shouts of â€œBernie , Bernieâ€ � .
â€œLet me say a word , well perhaps two words , about what momentum is all about , â€ � he added , describing how the media had dismissed him as a fringe candidate who started 60 - 70 points behind in polling but had failed to realise what was motivating voters .
â€œFrom coast to coast â€
¦ people are saying why is it we have grotesque levels of inequality ?
â€
¦
Why is it the great middle class of this country has been shrinking?â€ �
He raised recent tax disclosures in Panama for the first time on the campaign trail , claiming the revelations in the Guardian and elsewhere were â€œone of the reasons I oppose the [ 2011 ] free trade agreement with Panamaâ€ � and showed â€œexactly what I feared would happen â€ ¦ with wealthy people and large corporations figuring out how to avoid paying their fair share of taxesâ€ � .
Sanders said he could close the remaining delegate gap in the nomination race by persuading Democratic â€œsuperdelegatesâ€ � â€ “ party elites , the vast majority of whom are backing Clinton â€ “ to change their minds , prompting a fierce response from Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Robby Mook .
â€œYour vote is your voice , and the Sanders campaign shouldnâ€ ™ t be trying to circumvent the process â€ “ or the nearly 9 million ( and counting ) people who have made their voice heard for Hillary in this election , â€ � he wrote in an email to supporters .
With all but four precincts reporting , Sanders had 56.5 % to Clintonâ€ ™ s 43.1 % , while Cruz could boast 48.3 % to Trumpâ€ ™ s 35.1 % .
The Ohio governor , John Kasich , was on 14.1 % .
Both victories were in line with recent opinion polls in Wisconsin , but the win for Cruz â€ “ his ninth in the 2016 nomination race
â€ “ comes at a crucial time for the Republican party in particular .
Trump has lost his top spot in some national opinion polls and faces a difficult path to securing the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright , even though he is still comfortably ahead of Cruz .
Recent controversial remarks suggesting women should be â€œpunishedâ€ � for having abortions also seem to have cemented a growing and significant unpopularity among female voters .
And the Wisconsin defeat follows similar losses in the neighboring states of Iowa and Minnesota , a region where polite traditions of â€œmidwest niceâ€ � do not always sit easily with his aggressive New York rhetoric .
â€œWisconsin nice means weâ€ ™ re nice but weâ€ ™ re not pushovers , â€ � said Wisconsinâ€ ™ s governor , Scott Walker , at Cruzâ€
™ s election night victory party .
Cruz won the stateâ€ ™ s presidential primary on Tuesday after receiving the support of most of the stateâ€ ™ s power structure .
Influential governor and former presidential candidate Walker as well as nearly every conservative talk radio host in the state rallied behind the Texas senator in a last - ditch effort to stop Trump in the Badger State .
Cruz had long led in polls of the midwestern state , but Trump had criss - crossed the state in recent days , even bringing out his wife Melania in an attempt to close the gap .
He touted one outlier poll that showed him ahead , bragging on Monday night :
â€œYou see whatâ€ ™ s happening with the polls ?
Boom , like a rocket ship.â€ �
However , in a state where according to exit polls only 6 % of Republican voters saw immigration as their top issue and a majority said they would be scared or concerned if Trump was the nominee , it wasnâ€ ™ t enough .
In the week preceding the primary , Trumpâ€ ™ s
campaign manager was arrested for battering a reporter and the candidate repeatedly flip - flopped on abortion after his controversial initial remarks .
This , combined with a series of controversial comments on foreign policy , including saying that â€œnuclear proliferation is going to happen anywayâ€
� , had left Trump at his most politically vulnerable in months .
By the eve of the stateâ€ ™ s primary , the frontrunner had fallen out of first place in a national tracking poll for the first time in months .
Trump didnâ€
™ t help his cause by repeatedly bashing Walker .
He attacked the Wisconsin governorâ€ ™ s stewardship of the stateâ€ ™ s economy and boasted that he had â€œsent him packing like a little boyâ€ � from the presidential race .
Unusually for a Republican candidate , Trump even attacked Walker for not raising taxes .
While the attacks were well - received at his rallies , where many attendees â€ “ such as Sheila Roth of Wausau â€ “ were Democrats who had voted for Obama and against Walker but thought the GOP candidate would â€œbe good at bringing the jobs back to America where we need themâ€ � , in a state where Walker has won three elections in the past five years , this approach did not play well with many conservatives .
Trump still maintained some pockets of strength in rural , heavily Catholic areas in the north and west of the state , however , but these were eclipsed by Cruzâ€ ™ s strong performances in the so - called â€œWOW countiesâ€ � of Waukesha , Ozaukee and Washington that ring Milwaukee .
The Texas senator had counted on a strong performance in these areas , which had been crucial to Walkerâ€ ™ s electoral success and provided Mitt Romney with his winning margin over Rick Santorum in the stateâ€ ™ s 2012 presidential primary .
Cruz even held his election eve rally in crucial Waukesha County , the most populous of the three , to shore up his base there .
In a statement , Trump raged about â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � , saying : â€œTed Cruz is worse than a puppet
â€ “
he is a Trojan horse , being used by the party bosses to steal the nomination from Trump.â€ �
The Cruz campaign brushed this off , with top aide Jason Miller simply saying â€œDonaldâ€ ™ s gon na Donaldâ€ � .
Yet Cruzâ€ ™ s win still leaves him more than 200 delegates behind Trump in the race to reach the 1,237 mark needed to clinch the nomination and the Texas senator conceded tonight that a contested convention which he once derided as â€œa fever dreamâ€ � is now a likely scenario .
Further , the Republican primaries for the rest of April occur on Trumpâ€ ™ s home turf .
On 19 April Republicans will vote in Trumpâ€ ™ s home state of New York and the so - called â€œAcela Primaryâ€ � will be held on 26 April when Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland , Pennsylvania and Rhode Island hold their primaries .
Polling and demographic data indicates that these states should be strongholds for Trump .
But the Republican race still remains uncertain .
All the normal rules of politics have seemingly been suspended so far , and , as Trump said at a campaign rally on Monday night : â€œI donâ€ ™ t care about rules , folks.â€ �"
2016-04-06,"Republicans and Democrats voted in Wisconsin on Tuesday .
Hereâ€ ™ s what happened : Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat Bernie Sanders came away with big victories in the Badger State , as anticipated .
Cruz appeared to have won at least 36 of the 42 Republican delegates at stake and had a chance , as of this writing , of shutting Donald Trump out entirely in Wisconsin .
The result appeared to bring the Republican race one step closer to a contested convention scenario , in which no one candidate goes in with a majority of delegates .
Trump released a sour - grapes non - concession statement accusing Cruz of illegally coordinating with outside groups .
â€œTed Cruz is worse than a puppet
â€ “
he is a Trojan horse , being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr Trump ,
â€ � the statement said .
Hillary Clinton tweeted her congratulations to Sanders and asked supporters to look â€œforward!â€ � Sanders gave a victory speech in Wyoming , where Democrats vote Saturday .
He proclaimed momentum and projected victory .

â€ “ Vicente Fox , on Trump"
2016-04-06,"In theory , Wisconsinâ€ ™ s primaries arenâ€ ™ t that much of a big deal , with only 138 delegates available across both the Democratic and Republican parties .
But in practice , at this point in the election calendar , Wisconsin matters a lot .
And the wins that Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders clinched on Tuesday night have helped clarify the race to the White House :
Sanders isnâ€ ™ t the only candidate who faces an uphill climb to get his partyâ€ ™ s nomination â€ “ things
arenâ€ ™ t going to be easy for Donald Trump either .
The New York billionaire increasingly faces the prospect of a contested convention .
The Republican race Cruz obtained 48 % of the votes in Wisconsin , 13 percentage points ahead of Trump ( and 34 percentage points ahead of Kasich ) .
Because Wisconsin is largely a winner - takes - all state for Republicans , that vote share was enough for the Texas senator to pick up 36 of the 42 delegates available here .
As a result , Cruz has brought up his delegate total to 502 .
Thatâ€ ™ s still behind Trumpâ€ ™ s current total of 739 delegates but itâ€ ™ s significant because Cruzâ€ ™ s win helps to hold Trump back from that golden finish line : the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination .
Polling had predicted a much narrower win for Cruz .
Averages collected by Real Clear Politics suggested Cruz would defeat Trump by a margin of less than five percentage points ( polls also underestimated the performance of Sanders , who beat Hillary by a margin four times bigger than predicted ) .
Itâ€ ™ s likely that Cruz owes at least some of that success to Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s decision to drop out of the Republican race three weeks ago .
A month ago , polling suggested Rubio and Trump were level pegging in Wisconsin .
Nationally , it looks as though most Rubio supporters are choosing Cruz as their second choice rather than Trump â€ “
last nightâ€ ™ s results would suggest that a similar trend happened in Wisconsin .
Some of that may well be strategic .
Republicans who are aware of widely reported polling numbers may feel that Cruz is their best bet for keeping Trump out .
Endorsements may also have helped to solidify that perception .
Cruz currently has the backing of 39 elected officials while Trump and the Ohio governor , John Kasich , both have 11 .
Such factors might well be influential in Wisconsin where voter turnout was 73.2 % in 2012 ( the second - highest state figure in the country )
â€ “ but they might not necessarily be as important elsewhere .
Similarly , Cruz might have found it easier to collect votes in a state that is 71 % Christian than he will in
two weeksâ€ ™ time in New York , where just 60 % of adults are Christian .
Surveying six political experts , FiveThirtyEight projects that the 16 remaining Republican races will bring Trump to a delegate total of 1,201 â€
“ just shy of the 1,237 he needs to get the partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
Those experts could be wrong , though ; Trump might still manage to inch across the finish line .
Either way , the upcoming Republican primaries will be closely watched .
The Democratic race Despite coming first , Sanders too had a difficult night .
The Vermont senator won 57 % of the vote , significantly ahead of Hillary Clinton who won 43 % .
Unlike the Republicans , Democrats divide delegates according to vote share .
So in the end Sanders was able to add 45 pledged delegates to those he had gained in the primaries so far .
That still leaves Sanders trailing 249 delegates behind the former secretary of state ( and with an even larger gap to make up of 687 delegates once you account for Clintonâ€ ™ s huge lead in superdelegates , party elites who are not bound by primary results ) .
That said , Sanders is not out yet .
In his speeches , Sandersâ€ ™ rhetoric has focused on the idea of himself as the underestimated underdog who is building â€œmomentumâ€ � .
He has a point .
While itâ€ ™ s true that current polling suggests it will be very hard for Sanders to catch up with Clinton , the socialist candidate has already exceeded all expectations and may yet continue to do so .
Of course delegates and vote shares are what counts politically but ballot papers should matter too â€ “ if nothing else , because they represent individual voters .
On that measure , too , Sanders has much ground to recover .
Clinton has gained 2.5 m more votes than Sanders in the primaries held so far .
Wisconsinâ€ ™ s results show that the contest to be chosen as a presidential nominee in 2016 is still competitive .
In yet another strange twist of this election , after Wisconsin both Trump and Sanders need 58 % of remaining delegates to win their partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
And in both cases that will be tough .
No candidate can afford to rest on their laurels and no pundits can afford to write anyone off until the math shows they truly have zero chance of winning ."
2016-04-07,"Ted Cruz has emerged as the strongest alternative to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump after this weekâ€ ™ s decisive victory in the Wisconsin primary .
But as the party establishment rallies reluctantly around the Texas senator , the Republicansâ€ ™ apparent last hope of stopping Trump remains far from the party mainstream .
While Cruz is more cautious with his rhetoric , he is no stranger to controversy and remains to many within his party no more acceptable than Trump as the GOP nominee .
For Democratic supporters eyeing the opposition field , he also holds a record that is more reliably conservative than Trump and is in many cases to the right of the real estate mogul .
Cruz , elected to the US Senate in 2012 , has meticulously built an image as a conservative firebrand with little deference toward the traditional rules and procedure that bound both the Republican party and the institution in which he serves .
The senator rose to national prominence by orchestrating the 2013 shutdown of the federal government over Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s healthcare law and has routinely pursued tactics denounced by Republican leaders in Congress .
But in the absence of any palatable candidates who could actually defeat Trump , the same â€œWashington cartelâ€
�
Cruz often rails against is now shuffling reluctantly to his cause and coalescing around the first - term senatorâ€ ™ s candidacy .
The differences between Cruz and Trump are largely style over substance , however , and if chosen as the Republican nominee Cruz would be the partyâ€ ™ s most conservative standard bearer in modern history .
Immigration
The cornerstone of Trumpâ€ ™
s candidacy has been the issue of immigration , most notably his pledge to build a wall along the US - Mexico border .
Cruz also supports such a wall , only without Trumpâ€ ™ s bombastic suggestion that he will force Mexico to pay for it .
Last year , Cruz also embraced much of Trumpâ€ ™ s immigration platform as his own .
The senator came out against birthright citizenship , despite previously stating it was not a feasible goal under the US constitution .
Cruz also took a hardline stance against the H-1B visa program for foreign workers , even though he once backed legislation that would have quintupled the cap on guest worker visas .
And in a much - publicized feud with former candidate Marco Rubio , the senator from Florida , Cruz reluctantly made clear he did not support granting even legal status to the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US .
Over the course of two years , Cruz had repeatedly left the door open to legalization .
But amid a nasty debate with Rubio over what to do with the undocumented , Cruz categorically ruled out bringing the millions out of the shadows and said he instead favored â€œattrition through enforcementâ€ � â€ “ which pro - immigration advocates likened to self - deportation .
Religious liberty
The son of a pastor , Cruz has long placed the culture wars over social issues such as LGBT rights and abortion at the heart of his political brand .
The senatorâ€ ™ s
pathway to the nomination was even plotted around the evangelical voters who hold an outsize influence in the Republican primary .
When the supreme court declared same - sex marriage the law of the land last year , Cruz immediately responded with a proposed constitutional amendment that would institute a federal ban on gay couples from marrying .
He has also vigorously defended the spate of religious freedom laws that have emerged in conservative states and are viewed by progressives as gateways for discrimination by businesses against LGBT individuals .
Trumpâ€ ™ s forays into religion have been clumsy and unconvincing at best , not least when he was derided for quoting a biblical passage from â€œTwo Corinthiansâ€ � , rather than Second Corinthians , inspiring a wave of â€œTwo Corinthians walked into a barâ€ � gags .
Abortion
On abortion , too , Cruz draws upon his faith to advocate a fiercely pro - life position .
He has sponsored numerous bills that would limit access to abortion , such as a ban on the procedure at 20 weeks of pregnancy .
Cruz would also be to the right of Trump by opposing exceptions to abortion in cases of rape or incest .
And whereas Trump has defended Planned Parenthood as a candidate for providing other vital womenâ€ ™ s health services , Cruz has publicly lambasted the organization and vowed to defund it entirely .
He has , in fact , criticized Trump from the right over the latterâ€ ™ s inconsistency on abortion â€ “
Trump was once pro - choice â€ “ and although Cruz never called for women to be â€œpunishedâ€ � as his rival notoriously did , he has supported criminalizing abortion providers .
â€œWhen it comes to rape , rape is a horrific crime against the humanity of a person and needs to be punished and punished severely but at the same time , as horrible as that crime is , I donâ€
™ t believe itâ€ ™ s the childâ€ ™ s fault ,
â€ �
Cruz told Fox Newsâ€ ™ s Megyn Kelly this week .
â€œAnd we weep at the crime .
We want to do everything we can to prevent the crime on the front end and to punish the criminal , but I donâ€ ™ t believe it makes sense to blame the child.â€ �
National security Trump has gained substantial media coverage over his controversial proposals to ban Muslim immigrants from coming to the US and shut down mosques in America and for suggesting he was open to a federal registry of Muslim Americans .
Cruz has on occasion distanced himself from Trumpâ€ ™ s more outlandish proposals in the debate over terrorism and national security .
But in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels last month , it was Cruz who looked to get out ahead of his rival by proposing that police patrol Muslim neighborhoods in the US .
The suggestion garnered immediate backlash from Bill Bratton , the commissioner of the New York police department , as well as from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Cruz nonetheless stood by his plan amid the scrutiny and dismissed his detractors for their â€œleftwing radicalâ€ � positions .
And while Trump has been criticized for lacking substance on foreign policy , Cruzâ€ ™ s opponents in both parties have seized on the senatorâ€ ™ s declaration that he would â€œcarpet - bomb Isis into oblivionâ€ � as an unrealistic , if not unclear , strategy .
Criminal justice Cruz has been a vocal opponent of a bipartisan compromise in the Senate to reform the criminal justice system , despite once supporting lower sentences for nonviolent criminals .
During a hearing on the bill , which was authored by Cruzâ€ ™ s only friend in the Senate , Mike Lee of Utah , the senator in a scathing speech characterized the reform efforts as dangerously lenient .
Lee , who later went on to endorse Cruz anyway , was reportedly blindsided by his colleagueâ€ ™ s actions .
Cruz has also aggressively criticized the Black Lives Matter movement , stating in an interview last year that the protesters were â€œliterally suggesting and embracing and celebrating the murder of police officersâ€ � .
It was no surprise then that Cruz , during a campaign stop in the Bronx on Wednesday , seized on the opportunity to blast the New York City mayor , Bill de Blasio .
â€œEvery time there is a conflict between criminals and police officers , liberal Democrats side with the criminals , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThe moment when the brave men and women of the NYPD stood up and turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio , I cheered â€ ¦ that spoke to the entire country.â€ � Style Even as Cruz casts himself in the role of political outsider , competing for much of the Republican primary in the same lane as Trump , the senator holds the pedigree of a more traditional politician .
With a background that includes a debating career at Princeton University and tenure as the solicitor general of Texas from 2003 to 2008 , Cruz is far more polished on the stump , although not without his own element of theater .
His speaking style is often characterized as abrasive , even if he lacks the braggadocio that has defined Trump as a candidate .
But Cruz , like his opponent , has a take - no - prisoners approach to his agenda â€ “ he once infamously referred to Republican leader Mitch McConnell as a â€œliarâ€ � on the Senate floor .
His at times ruthless pursuit of ideology over practicality has earned Cruz few friends in the Senate , and just two of his colleagues in the chamber have endorsed him despite the Texanâ€ ™ s reported overtures .
Earlier this week , McConnell twice ducked a question in his weekly press conference as to whether he was willing to put aside his bad blood with Cruz as a means of stopping Trump .
Whether Cruz can , in fact , build the relationships he would need within the halls of the Capitol if he is to be the nominee â€ “ and whether doing so would undermine his anti - Washington shtick
â€ “ remains an open - ended question .
Trump and Cruz one and the same to Democrats
Even if Cruz is able to assuage the remaining concerns among those Republicans who see him as indistinguishable from Trump , Democrats are already showing themselves as eager to paint the two candidates as one and the same .
Priorities USA , the Super Pac supporting Clinton , has already gone to work to make the record clear .
The group unveiled a new digital ad on Wednesday in partnership with Planned Parenthood Votes , targeting women in the swing states of Florida and Ohio , that shows a mashup of comments by both Cruz and Trump to portray them as holding the same views on womenâ€ ™ s reproductive rights .
Top Democrats have also turned their attention toward Cruz in recent days as the senatorâ€ ™ s standing has risen in the polls .
Addressing reporters on Tuesday , Obama said Cruzâ€ ™ s proposals were â€œjust as draconianâ€ � as those of Trump â€ “ particularly on the issue of immigration .
And Clinton , in an interview with Politicoâ€ ™ s Glenn Thrush on Wednesday , blasted Cruz as â€œa mean - spirited guyâ€ � .
When asked about the choice facing the Republican party , she added :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t think that , you know , Ted Cruz is any better.â€ �"
2016-04-08,"Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign continued to lose delegates at the Republican convention in Denver , where Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has outplayed the businessman in party deals .
Republicans fight in the trenches Bernie Sanders announced he will speak at the Vatican about inequality next week .
â€œI am a big , big fan of the pope , â€ � he said .
â€œPeople think Bernie Sanders is a radical , read what the pope is writing!â€ � Sanders to preach in Rome With his threadbare campaign in disarray , Trump put Paul Manafort , a former adviser to a Kremlin - backed leader overthrown in revolution , in charge of his delegate plan .
Conservative groups flee to Senate Bill Clinton almost apologized for his response to Black Lives Matter protesters who criticized his record , and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s 1996 use of the phrase

“ Bill Clinton , on the verge of repentance The Florida senator and former presidential candidate declined to endorse Ted Cruz for president , and didnâ€ ™ t explain why he asked to hold on to the 171 delegates he won while running .
â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s not succeeding me , â€ � Barack Obama told a supporter .
But he added that he and Cruz were â€œdoing a service and that is laying bare , unvarnished some of the nonsenseâ€ � of Congress .
The president strikes back"
2016-04-09,"Ted Cruz continued his sweep of delegates in Colorado on Friday , running the table in the four remaining congressional districts holding conventions to send representatives to the RNC in Cleveland .
The Texas senator accumulated 12 more delegates , giving him 21 of the stateâ€ ™ s 37 delegates .
Thirteen of the remaining 16 will be chosen at Saturdayâ€ ™ s state convention , and the remaining three are party officials with automatic positions .
While only 17 of the 21 delegates were formally pledged to Cruz , the remaining four had all run on an official Cruz slate and one was even on Cruzâ€ ™ s statewide leadership team .
Cruz now has a majority of delegates in seven states , leaving him one state short of the current threshold to have his name placed into nomination under Rule 40 of the Republican party .
While Rule 40 is widely expected to be modified , Cruz will have a major tactical advantage in any rules fight by meeting this threshold .
Trump is the other only candidate to have won a majority of the delegates in eight states , and it is almost impossible for John Kasich to do so .
Cruzâ€ ™ s success in the state was built on a strong grassroots operation , and his campaign had been organizing in the Rocky Mountain State since last summer .
Senator Cory Gardner , a former Rubio supporter , said that he thought Cruz had the best organization of any of the three remaining candidates .
Alan Cobb , a top operative for Trump , shrugged off the results .
The campaign had been pessimistic about its prospects of winning any delegates there .
He said that there was real enthusiasm for his candidate in Colorado but that the stateâ€ ™ s unique system of selecting delegates meant that support for Trump would not be reflected in the stateâ€ ™ s delegation in Cleveland .
He compared it to a winner - take - all state where a candidate can win all the available delegates with a simple plurality .
Trumpâ€ ™ s only success in the stateâ€ ™ s seven district conventions happened in Coloradoâ€ ™ s fourth district , where Cruz only ran an official slate of three candidates , leaving three positions up for grabs .
The result was that while the Texas senator easily won all three delegate positions on the ballot there , two of the three available slots for alternates were filled by Trump supporters .
Despite getting shut out on Friday and the grim outlook for Trump at Saturdayâ€ ™ s state convention , the real estate mogul still has a clear path to getting the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination with a strong performance in New Yorkâ€ ™ s 19 April Republican primary ."
2016-04-09,"At the Colorado state convention on Saturday , as Republicans met to elect 13 delegates and 13 alternates to the national convention in Cleveland , the Donald Trump campaign inadvertently guided its supporters to vote for a delegate pledged to support Ted Cruz .
With more than 600 candidates on the ballot , voting was set to take place by Scantron , with state convention delegates listed in circles next to the number of their choice .
There were no names on the ballot .
All three presidential campaigns â€ “ those of Cruz , Trump and John Kasich â€
“ handed out sample ballots , providing a slate of names with the number to each candidate .
The problem for the Trump campaign was that they put out sample ballots featuring wrong numbers .
The campaign first put out a sample ballot with wrong numbers for seven delegates .
That was corrected , but there were still four numbers wrong .
One of the four uncorrected errors could have led Trump voters to cast their ballots for a candidate who is in fact pledged to support Cruz .
It was yet another example of the Trump campaign , which hired its current state director on Tuesday , struggling to organize in Colorado .
Alan Cobb , a top operative from the campaign , told the Guardian â€œour numbers were correct at the time of printingâ€ � and suggested the issue lay with the state party making constant revisions to the delegate order .
He noted though that â€œitâ€ ™ s unlikely to make any difference in the final resultâ€ � .
A state party spokesman did not respond to a request for comment .
Both Kasich and Cruz had every number on their respective slates correct and Cruz , who came to address the gathering in person , even had his delegate slate displayed behind him on a big screen while on stage .
Furthermore , at a congressional district convention on Thursday , the Trump campaign handed out slate cards that featured two candidates who were not listed on the ballot .
Neither Kasich nor Trump attended the gathering in a state that has long been a stronghold for Cruz , a senator from Texas .
The Trump campaign has long been pessimistic about its chances in Colorado .
The Kasich campaign has often promoted its delegates on an â€œopen convention slateâ€ � , instead of using the Ohio governorâ€ ™ s name on its material .
In the seven congressional district conventions held in the state over the past week , Cruz won all 21 delegates at stake ."
2016-04-10,"Ted Cruz continued his dominance in Colorado on Saturday , winning all of the final 13 delegates to the Republican National Convention available at the stateâ€ ™ s convention .
The Texas senator has now won all 34 delegates up for grabs in the state and is now fewer than 200 delegates behind Donald Trump in the race to the 1,237 needed to clinch the Republican nomination .
The final 13 came in a marathon sitting in a hockey arena where nearly 4,000 delegates spent their Saturday listening to dozens of speeches from various candidates for elected office .
The process culminated when all 600 delegates to the national convention got the chance to speak for 10 seconds to the assembled crowd .
They lined up all the way down the arena for their chance to shout brief elevator pitches into the microphone such as : â€œthe only person better to be president than Ted Cruz is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is not a natural born citizenâ€ � , or â€œDonald Trump !
Buy Colorado weed!â€
�
Cruz had been organizing in the state since 2015 .
Representative Ken Buck , Cruzâ€ ™ s state chair , told the Guardian how â€œdozens and dozens of volunteers lined up to help Ted Cruz and push people to caucuses , got people elected to county assemblies and on to the state assemblyâ€ � .
The only candidate to have organized in the state in a serious way was Marco Rubio and Buck noted that the fact the race had become a one - on - one battle between Trump and Cruz
â€œhelped voters to make up their mindsâ€ � .
Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign hired its state director earlier this week and believed that even earning a single delegate in Colorado would have been a pleasant surprise .
The voting took place on large scantron sheets where attendees got up to 26 votes for the 13 delegate and 13 alternates to Cleveland .
They would bubble in circles next to a corresponding number for each delegate and each campaign handed out slate cards so voters could see the appropriate numbers for their chosen delegates .
The haphazard nature of this was revealed when the results took over four hours to count because many attendees cast more than 26 votes on their ballot .
Cruz , who was the only candidate to speak at the convention , even had his slate displayed behind him on a giant screen while he spoke on stage .
The Trump campaignâ€ ™ s lack of organization in the state was amplified by making basic mistakes .
The New York Republicanâ€ ™ s campaign put out sample ballots featuring wrong numbers .
The campaign first put out a sample ballot with wrong numbers for seven delegates .
That was corrected , but there were still four numbers wrong .
One of the four uncorrected errors could have led Trump voters to cast their ballots for a candidate who is in fact pledged to support Cruz .
The resulting miscues meant that one candidate for a Trump delegate used his 10 seconds on stage to urge attendees to â€œread the names on the ticket .
A third of the numbers have been changedâ€ � .
Alan Cobb , a top operative from the campaign , told the Guardian â€œour numbers were correct at the time of printingâ€ � and suggested the issue lay with the state party making constant revisions to the delegate order .
He noted though that â€œitâ€ ™ s unlikely to make any difference in the final resultâ€ � .
A state party spokesman did not respond to a request for comment .
This misstep followed a congressional district convention on Thursday , the Trump campaign handed out slate cards that featured two candidates who were not listed on the ballot .
In contrast , both Kasich and Cruz had every number on their respective slates correct .
Cruz had a vibrant effort with volunteers in orange T - shirts blanketing the arena .
Each shirt had the Cruz slate printed in full on the back .
Kasich , dealing with a very conservative electorate at the state convention , had slate cards printed both as the official Kasich slate as well as â€œan open convention slateâ€ � , committed only to picking the â€œbest nominee to unite the partyâ€ � .
Despite getting shut out on Saturday , the Kasich campaign is still having conversations with Cruz delegates in the state in hopes of persuading them to consider the Ohio governor .
In other delegate contests on Saturday , Cruz earned almost every delegate for grabs in Iowaâ€ ™ s four congressional district conventions and edged out Trump in the convention in Virginiaâ€ ™ s ninth congressional district .
In Iowa , the Trump campaign had only urged supporters to attend the stateâ€ ™ s first - in - the - nation caucuses on 1 February and had made no attempt to encourage Trump supporters to be involved in electing delegates .
The result left the real estate mogul reeling in a state that he finished in a close second to Cruz .
AJ Spiker , a former state party chair in Iowa who organized a successful effort by Ron Paul to win delegates there in 2012 , slammed Trumpâ€ ™ s efforts in the state .
â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s convention strategy in Iowa was a complete failure , â€ � said Spiker .
â€œThis is something he should have been preparing for in 2015 and it looks like something put together in the last 48 hours.â€ �
In Virginia , Cruz won two delegates to Trumpâ€ ™ s one in an area where Trump won 47 % of the vote in the stateâ€ ™ s 1 March primary .
These results will not matter on a first ballot in July where delegates will be bound by results in Iowa and Virginiaâ€ ™ s nominating contests .
However , if the convention goes to a second ballot or beyond , delegates become unbound , which gives Cruz a significant advantage in a contested convention .
Cruz though fell short in maneuvering in Michigan , where Wolverine state Republicans held their state convention on Saturday .
Trump and Kasich were able to combine to win key slots on the rules committee and credentials committee and elect all the delegates they earned in the stateâ€ ™ s March primary .
In a statement , Brian Jack , the national delegate director for the Trump campaign , said : â€œThis was a big win for team Trump .
We won 25 delegates from Michigan last month , and now , at least 25 supporters of Mr Trump will be delegates to the Republican National Convention.â€ �
Trump has 743 of the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot .
He needs to win just over 60 % of the remaining delegates in order to avoid a potential second ballot and contested convention ."
2016-04-10,"Right after Ted Cruz gave a major address on Saturday to hundreds of pro - Israel Republican Jewish Coalition members at the Las Vegas resort and casino owned by the billionaire Sheldon Adelson , roughly a dozen wealthy board members of the RJC â€ “ which is mainly underwritten by Adelson â€ “ hosted a roundtable discussion with the Texan , giving him a chance to woo donors in a more intimate setting .
The pro - Cruz Trusted Leadership Super Pac had in recent weeks also arranged to hold a three - day retreat at the Venetian resort and casino , where the annual three - day RJC event was being held .
On Friday night , the Trusted Leadership Pac threw a bash that drew several rich RJC donors who had recently become Cruz supporters after their first choices had dropped out .
The overlapping Las Vegas events underscore how a pro - Cruz Super Pac , and a number of RJC allies who are raising money for the Cruz campaign , are moving fast to capitalize on the candidateâ€ ™ s big win in Wisconsin for fundraising and political gains , as the senator tries to sustain his momentum and overtake Donald Trump in the Republican race .
To be sure , Cruz has long been popular with a number of RJC donors and Adelson primarily because of his staunch backing for Israel , the No 1 issue for the 40,000-member conservative RJC .
A key example : last September , Cruz spearheaded a rally of conservative groups at the Capitol â€ “ which also featured Donald Trump as his special guest â€ “ to oppose the Iran nuclear deal , a top priority for the RJC and other pro - Israel groups .
â€œThe Cruz train is looking appealing , â€ � said Michael Epstein , an RJC board member and commercial estate developer from Maryland who only recently joined the campaignâ€ ™ s finance team , after initially backing Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , and then Florida senator Marco Rubio .
Epstein told the Guardian he and a dozen other board members â€ “ including California venture capitalist Elliott Broidy , New York real estate investor Ben Heller and Houston businessman
Fred Zeidman â€ “ organized the roundtable , which drew about 75 people , giving Cruz a chance to â€œwelcome everybodyâ€ � to become supporters .
â€œObviously money is important , and weâ€ ™ re talking to everybody elseâ€ � about the campaignâ€ ™ s needs , he said .
Epstein also attended the Super Pac event Friday evening .
â€œIâ€ ™ m sure the Pac people will be happy to take our checks ,
â€ � he quipped .
But while Cruzâ€ ™ s hawkish positions on Israelâ€ ™ s security needs have endeared him to many RJC donors and fundraisers , ambivalence and concerns are palpable too : the Texanâ€ ™ s hard right views on immigration and some other social issues coupled with his slash and burn political style , have caused heartburn for several of its big fundraisers and donors who tend to be more moderate on domestic issues .
â€œIâ€ ™ m supporting Cruz solely on the basis of Israel , â€ � said Jay Zeidman , another Houston businessman and the son of Fred Zeidman .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no better ally of the Jewish state and its security needs , â€ � he added , but stressed that â€œI donâ€ ™ t agree with him on immigration and other social issuesâ€ � .
Both Zeidmans , who were early backers of Jeb Bush and are known for their fundraising prowess , only opted in late March to support Cruz .
A number of prominent RJC board members , including Florida shopping mall magnate Mel Sembler , who was a major fundraiser for a pro - Bush Super Pac , have shied away from picking other candidates .
Several RJC board members are dissatisfied with the current choices and the acrimonious nature of the campaigns .
Still , a growing number of the 50-plus wealthy RJC board members â€ “ whose ranks include two former ambassadors under former president George W Bush and former senator Norm Coleman â€ “ now see Cruz as their best option to regain the White House , despite what they consider his flaws .
Epstein , who introduced Cruz before his big Saturday speech to 500 RJC members attending the annual spring meeting , noted in an interview that Trump and John Kasich were also invited to speak to the RJC , but only Cruz accepted .
â€œI think weâ€ ™ re a little surprised , â€ � he added , with a touch of understatement , when asked why Trump and Kasich didnâ€ ™ t come .
Along with other candidates , all three addressed an RJC gathering in Washington in December , at which Trump drew harsh reviews for commenting that he would be a neutral player in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians , an idea that many RJC members scorn .
Trump reportedly declined an invitation to a private dinner that Adelson had for the RJC board on Thursday at his Las Vegas mansion , leaving some board members puzzled .
Cruz and other candidates have aggressively courted Adelsonâ€ ™ s big checkbook and political support for months , and the Texan ( along with Rubio , before he dropped out ) has been near of the top of the billionaireâ€ ™ s list , say Adelson allies .
The frenzied chase to woo Adelson â€ “ whose net worth is close to $ 28bn
â€ “ is hardly surprising : in 2012 , the casino owner and his wife , Miriam , poured almost $ 150 m into a mix of Super Pacs , which must disclose their donors , and not - for - profit organizations , which donâ€ ™ t have to , making them the GOPâ€ ™ s leading contributors .
But unlike in 2012 , when Adelson and his wife gave $ 15 m early on to a Super Pac backing their longtime close ally Newt Gingrich â€ “ the former House speaker who dropped out of the primaries after launching some damaging attacks against Mitt Romney â€ “
the couple have been much more cautious this year .
They want to back a candidate who can win in November , and they may not make any big funding commitments before a nominee is picked , say RJC sources .
Adelson , whom many GOP operatives deem mercurial , and his wife each gave $ 2,700 to the Cruz campaign last November .
But in February , in a recording of comments Adelson made at a gala honoring former New York City mayor and current Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani , Adelson suggested heâ€
™ d back Trump if he wins the nomination by saying :
â€œWhy not?â€
�
This weekend , the Adelsons even left the RJC meeting early to attend a wedding in Baltimore .
Despite Adelsonâ€ ™ s departure , both the Cruz Super Pac , which takes unlimited checks , and the campaign , which can only accept donations of $ 2,700 per person , were poised to do well in Las Vegas .
Among the Super Pac leaders in Las Vegas was Alice Hanley , the treasurer of the Trusted Leadership Pac , which was launched in March to bring in new big donors .
Hanley did not respond to requests for comment .
Trusted Leadership has become the political vehicle for raking in new unlimited donations following on the heels of few other Super Pacs â€ “ under the moniker
Keep the Promise â€ “ that were formed in 2015 .
Three of these Super Pacs were largely bankrolled by a few individuals giving at least $ 10 m each .
A 1 April email to potential donors from Kate Doner , a top fundraiser for the new Pac , indicated that all the other Super Pacs had been â€œrolled into Trusted Leadership to optimize resources and talentâ€ � ."
2016-04-10,"The man charged with bringing order to Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s chaotic campaign for president has accused the millionaireâ€ ™ s main Republican rival , Ted Cruz , of â€œGestapo tacticsâ€ � , a day after Trump failed to win a single elected supporter at the Colorado state convention .
â€œYou go to these county conventions and you see the Gestapo tactics , the scorched - earth tactics , â€ � said Paul Manafort ,
Trumpâ€ ™ s newly appointed â€œconvention managerâ€ � , in an interview with NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press on Sunday .
Manafort was not specific about what Cruz , the Texas senator who is best placed to take on Trump , or his campaign had done to remind him of the Nazi secret police .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to be filing several protests because the reality is , they are not playing by the rules , â€ �
he said .
â€œIf they donâ€
™ t get what they want , they blow it up .
Thatâ€ ™ s not going to work.â€ �
Trump still leads Cruz in the race to secure the Republican nomination , which requires 1,237 delegates at the partyâ€ ™ s convention in Cleveland in July .
But Cruz has organized well with local conservatives and state leaders loathe to see Trump as their nominee .
In contrast to the way Cruzâ€ ™ s team has managed the messy local politics of Colorado and Louisiana , Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign has become a picture of gilded chaos : wild and sometimes violent rallies , outrageous and contradictory claims on Twitter and TV , and a campaign manager charged with battery against a reporter .
In Colorado , the Trump campaign put out mislabelled ballots and would - be delegates made such pitches for support as â€œDonald Trump !
Buy Colorado weed!â€
�
Manafort said : â€œI acknowledge that we werenâ€ ™ t playing in Colorado and they did.â€
�
On Sunday , Trump himself accused Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign of bribing delegates , apparently in an allusion to Louisiana , where Cruz gained delegates through local politics despite Trump having won the stateâ€ ™ s primary .
â€œI win a state in votes and then get non - representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign , â€ � he tweeted .
â€œBad system!â€ � The businessman hired Manafort to reorganize his campaign , hoping to draw on the aideâ€ ™ s experience in helping Gerald Ford win a contested convention against Ronald Reagan in 1976 .
Manafort has since advised Viktor Yanukovych , the twice - ousted former leader of Ukraine , and Ferdinand Marcos , the former dictator of the Philippines .
Though Cruz has a poor chance to defeat Trump outright , if he can prevent the businessman from getting 1,237 delegates , he will stand a better chance of rallying anti - Trump Republicans to his campaign .
Manafort insisted that Trump will do well in New York , which votes on 19 April and has 95 delegates at stake for Republicans , and in east coast states to which candidates of both parties have flocked ahead of April elections .
The Democratic contest also took on an increasingly personal tone over the weekend , as Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigned in New York , where the former grew up and the latter set down roots .
In his native borough , Brooklyn , Sanders sharpened his criticisms of Clinton .
â€œIn terms of her judgment , something is clearly lacking
, â€ � the senator told NBC on Sunday , alluding to Clintonâ€ ™ s support for free trade agreements and her reliance on donations from Wall Street .
But the senator repeated that he would support Clinton as the nominee against any Republican , telling CNN : â€œWe will do everything possible to prevent this country from seeing a Donald Trump or some other Republican in the White House.â€ � Clinton did not deign to attack her rival ahead of their New York debate this Thursday .
â€œI donâ€
™ t have anything negative to say about him , â€ � she told CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Nation .
â€œIâ€ ™
d take him over Donald Trump or Ted Cruz any day.â€ �
The former secretary of state , confident in her big lead in delegates and superdelegates , instead shifted toward the general election and faced questions about the legacy of crime and poverty that many say her husband created as president in the 1990s .
Earlier this week , protesters confronted Bill Clinton at a rally in Philadelphia , criticizing him presiding over a huge increase in the number of black people sent to prison , and for his wifeâ€ ™ s use of the term â€œsuper - predatorâ€ � .
On Sunday , Clinton defended her husband .
â€œThere were a lot of people very scared and concerned about high crime back in the day , and now we have to say , â€˜OK , weâ€ ™ ve got to deal with the consequences , â€ ™ â€ �
she said , acknowledging that too many people were in prison .
She also received an unexpected boost from Barack Obama , who gave his first interview to Fox News in more than two years .
The president defended Clinton over accusations that she compromised national security through her use of a private email server .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a carelessness in terms of managing emails that she has owned , â€ � he conceded , before stressing : â€œShe would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.â€
�
â€œThis is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state , and did an outstanding job , â€ � he added ."

Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s new top aide accused Ted Cruz of â€œgestapo tacticsâ€ � and the Republican frontrunner suggested Cruz bribed delegates with â€œgoodiesâ€ � .
If they donâ€ ™ t get what they want , they blow it up , â€ � convention manager Paul Manafort told NBC .
â€œThatâ€
™ s not going to work.â€ �
Barack Obama defended Hillary Clinton in his first interview with Fox News in years , saying : â€œShe would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.â€ �
The president acknowledged â€œa carelessnessâ€ � in the way she handled a private email server while secretary of state , but praised her skills and dedication effusively .
Obama also said he will keep Merrick Garland as his nominee for the supreme court no matter what happens in the presidential election .
He also repeated his call for Republican senators to meet Garland in the public : â€œI think if they go through the process they wonâ€ ™ t have a rationale to defeat him.â€
�
The president added that partisan politics endanger the US far more than any external threat .
â€œThis can be our century just like the 20th century was , as long as we donâ€ ™ t tear each other apart because [ of ] our politics , values , sensationalism , conflict.â€ �
Bernie Sanders said he has â€œdoubts about what kind of president [ Hillary Clinton ] would makeâ€ � and â€œIn terms of her judgement , something is clearly lacking.â€
�
But he added he would support a nominated Clinton :
â€œwe will do everything possible to prevent this country from seeing Donald Trump or some other Republican in the White House.â€ �
Hillary Clinton declined to criticized Sanders returned the favor of hypothetical support :
â€œIâ€ ™
d take him over Donald Trump or Ted Cruz any day.â€ �
She also defended her husbandâ€ ™ s legacy as president during the 1990s , including his decision to sign a now controversial crime bill .
â€œThere were a lot of people very scared and concerned about high crime back in the day , and now we have to say OK , and deal with the consequences.â€ �
Hillary and Bill Clinton are campaigning in New York City today , after a black - tie dinner on Saturday night with lawmakers , lobbyists and reporters in midtown Manhattan .
Per her campaignâ€ ™ s pool report , the event featured a musical performance by reporters and Leslie Odom Jr , of the cast of Hamilton , and a third act with mayor Bill de Blasio .
â€œThanks for the endorsement , Bill , â€ �
she told the mayor .
â€œTook
you long enough.â€
�
â€œSorry , Hillary , â€ � de Blasio said .
â€œI run on C.P. time.â€ � â€œCautious politician time , â€ � she said .
â€œok , there are a lot of things I could ask you of international , national , city and state importance ,
â€ � she said .
â€œWill
you just fix those MetroCard slots ?
It took me like five swipes , â€ �
she said .
â€œFix the turnstiles.â€ �
On Sunday morning , the former president hit Harlem , with a stop at the Abyssinian Baptist Church on 138th Street .
Heâ€ ™ s touring the area with Representative Charlie Rengel â€ “ seemingly as part of an effort to make up for his confrontation with black protesters in Philadelphia , and subsequent not - an - apology apology last week .
At the church , Reverend Floyd Flake praised Clinton for creating more opportunities for black Americans .
The presidential candidate also spoke , saying she knows people are â€œfrustratedâ€ � with politics and â€œheartsickâ€ � over gun violence .
And she concluded by talking about the vicious primary contest she fought against Barack Obama in 2008 â€ “ and their eventual reconciliation and teamwork .
It sounds like a coded message to any Bernie Sanders supporters in the room , and to the senator himself .
â€œAt the end he won
, I lost and I supported him , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œHe asked me to be secretary of state
and I said yes for the same reason :
we both love our country.â€
�
She threw in a few kind words for the president , too .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves .
Saving the economy , passing the affordable care act insuring 20 million americans and for doing so much else that has been good.â€ �
Stepping away from the campaign trail for a moment , Ed Pilkington has this :
The governor of Virginia , Terry McAuliffe , has until midnight on Sunday to decide whether to bring back the electric chair as a compulsory method of execution .
Should the Democratic governor sign the bill currently sitting on his desk , the Virginia department of corrections would be empowered to kill condemned prisoners using a contraption known macabrely in the state as â€œOld Sparkyâ€ � .
Should McAuliffe abstain tonight from doing anything , the law will come into effect on 1 July â€ “ only his active veto would stop it .
â€œLike
most death penalty states , â€ �
Ed writes , â€œVirginia has struggled in the face of a tight boycott imposed by the European Union and major drug companies that refuse to send medical drugs used in executions to the US on ethical grounds.â€ �
Hence , the possible return of the chair , which 300 religious leaders have opposed .
Ed also writes this : The dilemma is further intensified by McAuliffeâ€ ™ s close ties to Hillary Clinton , and the likelihood that any decision to facilitate the return of the electric chair will reverberate on the presidential campaign trail .
McAuliffe was chairman of Clintonâ€ ™ s last presidential campaign , in 2008 , and before that helped Bill Clinton earn a second term in the White House in 1996 .
And this : The decision confronting the governor is a fraught one , given the dark track record of the electric chair in Virginiaâ€ ™ s racially skewed history .
The chair was first used in 1908 to kill a black man convicted of the rape of a white woman .
Since then , 217 of the 267 people who have died by electrocution have been African American .
Hereâ€ ™ s Edâ€ ™ s piece in full : Bernie Sanders makes another appearance , this time on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press .
Host Chuck Todd asks about the delegate gap between Sanders and Hillary Clinton â€ “ how even though heâ€ ™ s won seven states in a row heâ€ ™ s cut into Clintonâ€ ™
s lead only by 10 delegates .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re feeling really good with a path toward victory , â€ �
Sanders insists .
â€œNew York is extremely important ,
â€ �
but he says he can â€œabsolutelyâ€
� win the nomination without winning the state .
Americans understand that â€œitâ€ ™ s just too late for establishment politicsâ€ � , Sanders says .
Todd asks about the harsh tone that seeped into the Democratic race last week .
â€œSecretary Clinton has been going after us , along with her surrogates , very , very hard ,
â€ �
Sanders says .
He notes a Washington Post headline that read â€œClinton questions whether Sanders is
qualifiedâ€
� , although Clinton herself never said Sanders was unqualified .
She said â€œhe hadnâ€ ™ t done his homeworkâ€ � on specific issues , but the Sanders campaign homed in on the word â€œunqualifiedâ€ � and made its criticisms in turn .
Sanders has walked some of those back , saying Clinton is qualified , but he tells NBC : â€œIn terms of her judgement , something is clearly lacking.â€
�
His argument for lapses in judgement : â€œWhen you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs .
When you support and continue to support fracking , despite the crisis that we have .
And essentially when you have a super pac thatâ€ ™
s raising tens of millions of dollars from every interest out there , including $ 15 m from
Wall Street.â€ �
Ohio governor John Kasich , meanwhile , is in Greece , New York , where he is â€œrunning equal with Donald Trumpâ€ � and where he says he will win more delegates than he has been winning , which has not been very many .
Kasich is a way off the Republican pace , heading for what he hopes will be a contested convention .
â€œIf we get blown out in the fall , which I think we could with Cruz or Trump , we could lose the Senate , â€ � he says .
Heâ€ ™ s the man to stop that , he says .
Heâ€ ™ s not biting on whether Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan might descend from the heavens on to such a contested convention and take the nomination â€ “
he is the second choice of most Trump and Cruz voters , he says .
But he does invoke a figure with a certain place in Republican heaven , â€œold Honest Abeâ€ � â€ “ Lincoln â€ “ who went into his convention in 1860 â€œthird or fourthâ€ � and ended up one of the greatest presidents of all .
Kasich continues :
Iâ€ ™ m going to have more delegates than I have now
and I am going to be viable .
I am the only person who can beat Hillary Clinton in the fall .
Are we going to nominate someone who isnâ€ ™ t viable ?
Itâ€ ™ s nuts !
He can attract conservative Democrats , independents , he says .
But he wonâ€ ™ t attack Clinton herself .
Everyone else will , John .
Kasich is now asked about North Carolinaâ€ ™ s controversial anti - anti - discrimination law , which this week cost the state a Bruce Springsteen gig .
Would he have signed it ?
â€œProbably not.â€ � Religious institutions should be protected , Kasich says , but â€œwhen you get beyond that it can become â€ ¦ a contentious issue.â€ � â€œI
wouldnâ€ ™ t have signed that law , â€ � he says .
â€œNathan Deal , the governor of Georgia , vetoed another oneâ€ ¦ why do we have to write a law every time we turn around .
Canâ€ ™ t we just get along with each other?â€ � Kasich , forever protesting his viability in the face of what Ben Carson would call â€œhorrible numbersâ€ � , is perfecting a new mood in this campaign : the genially cross .
The affably aggravated .
The pleasantly peeved .
Heâ€ ™ s mad as hell and heâ€ ™ s not going to take it anymore
but aw shucks , canâ€ ™ t everyone be nicer to each other ?
Call it what you will .
Todd asks Manafort about how heâ€ ™ s planning on clinching the nomination with 1,237 delegates , which would avoid a contested convention â€ “ the scenario that Ted Cruz is hoping for .
Whoâ€ ™ s running this campaign , you or the manager ?
â€œDonald
Trump is running this campaign , â€ � Manafort says .
â€œAnd Iâ€ ™ m working directly for Donald Trump , but Iâ€ ™ m working with the whole team as well .
And a lot of whatâ€ ™ s being talked about is much ado about nothing .
Yes , thereâ€ ™ s a transition .
Itâ€ ™ s a natural transition.â€ �
Manafort says that as the months have worn on , â€œa more traditional campaign has to take place , and Donald recognizes that.â€ �
What about campaign tactics ?
A friend of Trump recently threatened to send the businessmanâ€ ™ s supporters to delegates hotel rooms , for instance .
â€œIâ€
™ m not giving him my hotel room ,
â€ �
Manafort tries to joke .
Todd presses the point â€ “ is this kind of rhetoric acceptable ?
Trumpâ€ ™ s top aide doesnâ€ ™ t exactly denounce the implied threat :
â€œItâ€ ™ s not my style ,
itâ€ ™ s not Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s style .
But it is Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s style .
â€œYou go to these county conventions , and you see the Gestapo tactics , the scorched earth tacticsâ€ ¦
Todd : Gestapo ! ?
Manafort says the campaign is going to file some complaints , even as it tries to do woo delegates however possible from Cruz .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s the law , thereâ€ ™ s ethics , and thereâ€ ™ s getting the votes.â€ �
He says his main strategy is to get Trump talking to delegates more directly .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s
â€œconvention managerâ€ �
Paul Manafort is on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press , where host Chuck Todd asks him about the businessmanâ€ ™ s recent defeats in winning delegates in Colorado and Wisconsin .
â€œI acknowledge that we werenâ€ ™ t playing in Colorado , and they did , â€ �
Manafort says , regarding Cruzâ€ ™ s sweep of the 34 delegates there .
â€œI acknowledge that theyâ€ ™ ve taken an approach to some of the county conventions where theyâ€ ™ ve taken a scorched earth policy , and they donâ€ ™ t care about the party .
â€œ â€œIf they donâ€ ™ t get what they want , they blow it up .
Thatâ€ ™ s not going to work .
â€œAnd in fact , itâ€ ™ s all secondary games , because when yourâ€ ™ e talking about delegates , you know to distinguish between actual delegates or Trojan delegates , which are people that are committed to support someone on the first ballot , regardless of who theyâ€ ™ re for.â€
� Itâ€ ™ s CBS and itâ€ ™ s Bernie Sanders .
So how about winning the vote but splitting the delegates with Clinton in Wyoming ?
â€œThere is no question that we have the momentum , â€ � he says ,
like he said 15 minutes ago on ABC .
Then he was in George Stephanopoulosâ€ ™ s shiny blue studio .
Heâ€ ™ s now in front of a wall of books , speaking to John Dickerson who is in DC .
Does ABCâ€ ™ s New York HQ have a library ?
A smoking room ?
You have to hope so .
Bernie details his electoral map and says , again , that â€œour message is resonatingâ€ � and in the east and west he will do well .
Does his lack of appeal in the south damage his chances of being a successful president ?
â€œWe are waging what we call a political revolution , â€ � he says , which means no president can achieve it all alone .
â€œWhat we need is a strong political movement , where millions of working people , young people , stand up and fight back.â€
�
This is happening with the $ 15 minimum wage , he says , as it has passed in California and elsewhere .
Dickerson turns to the contested convention of 1980 , when Ted Kennedy took his â€œmovementâ€ � to the convention and fought , and lost .
â€œObviously we will use our role to shape the platform , â€ � Sanders says â€ “ which involves a roll call of his policy positions .
So thatâ€ ™ s a â€ ¦ yes ?
Then itâ€ ™ s into the spat over whether Hillary Clinton is qualified to be president again .
Sanders says again it was a remark about her judgment , but he â€œwants to get away from this stuffâ€ � and have a proper debate .
Dickerson presses .
Is her judgment a disqualifying factor for the presidency ?
â€œNo.â€
�
And the press attention to his interviews this week , in which some people said he had no detail about his sweeping calls for reform and revolution , for example on Wall Street .
He dodges .
Finally , Obama is asked about the 2016 campaign and the movements of frustrated voters whoâ€ ™ ve coalesced around Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re still shell shocked from what happened in 2007 and 2008,â€ �
Obama says , alluding to the financial crisis that nearly wrecked the worldâ€ ™ s economy .
The US has inched back to recovery , he says , â€œbut people lost homes , lost jobs , lost life savings , and they still donâ€ ™ t fullyâ€ � feel that recovery .
When people feel left out , he says , Americans of different politics have different reactions .
For conservatives those broken promises â€ “ eg to repeal his signature healthcare act â€ “
â€œmust be because Republicans were corrupt and not responsiveâ€
� , influenced by big money , Obama says .
â€œIf Democrats get frustrated they say why donâ€ ™ t we have a public optionâ€ � for healthcare , he continues , noting too that most Americans are covered by their employer and many donâ€ ™ t want a singlepayer system .
These frustrations , the president says , obscure successes .
â€œOur economy right now is stronger than any other advanced economy â€ ¦
We have the best workers .
We have the best universities .
We are the most innovative .
We have the most advanced scientific community .
â€œThis can be our century just like the 20th century was , as long as we donâ€ ™ t tear each other apart because our politics , values , sensationalism , conflict , â€ � he says .
Obama concludes that the US will be in danger when â€œwe donâ€ ™ t have the ability to compromiseâ€ � .
John Podesta is next on ABC â€ “ heâ€
™ s
chair of the Clinton campaign and after a video of SNL mocking Clinton over her New York subway snafu this week
, he laughs and says : â€œI think weâ€ ™ re going to win New York.â€
�
Of course he does .
Podesta says Sandersâ€ ™ run of seven wins in a row was in territory and voting formats favourable to him , and that in the bigger states now coming along the trail , in primaries , Clinton will put together a run of her own .
He also defends Bill Clinton about the 1994 crime bill and says of Sanders : â€œhe voted for this billâ€ ¦ in 2006 he campaigned for the Senate and said â€˜Iâ€ ™ m tough on crimeâ€ ™ and he pointed to this crime bill.â€ � Podesta is also asked about Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s enduring problem with being seen as honest and trustworthy by voters of any and every stripe .
â€œAs
she has said , â€ � he says , â€œmaybe she is better at doing the job than campaigning for the job.â€ � Well , quite .
Does she need to get the email issue wrapped up , Stephanopoulos asks ?
â€œThatâ€ ™ s up to Mr Comey , â€ �
Podesta said , referring to the FBI director .
â€œIf they want to talk to her
they can talk to her
but they havenâ€ ™ t.â€
�
Then Wallace asks Obama about the investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s use of a private email server during her tenure as his secretary of state .
â€œShe would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy , â€ � Obama says , before saying that thereâ€ ™ s a problem of semantics in how the government does its business .
â€œI handle a lot of classified information , â€ � he says .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s classified and then thereâ€ ™ s classified.â€ � â€œThereâ€ ™ s stuff that is really top secret top secret , and there s stuff going out to the president or secretary of state , stuff
you donâ€ ™ t want on the transom , or going out over the wires , â€ � he continues , but is basically â€œopen - sourcedâ€ � material .
â€œI also think it is important to keep this in perspective , â€ � Obama said .
â€œThis is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state , and did an outstanding job.â€ �
He adds , though , that Clinton herself has acknowledged the server was a mistake : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a carelessness in terms of managing emails that she has owned.â€ �
No one has suggested , he says , â€œthat that detracted rom her excellent ability to carry out her dutiesâ€ � .
Wallace asks about the investigation itself .
â€œI guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department or the FBI.â€
�
The president is emphatic .
â€œGuaranteed .
Period.â€ � Obama is next asked about terrorism , and his call for Americans to live their lives normally in the face of it .
Is he not worried about it , Wallace asks .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think we make too big a deal of the terror threat , â€ � Obama says .
â€œMy number one priority is going after Isil , â€ �
he adds , using the acronym for the terror group Islamic State .
â€œMy point is how we do it is important .
That we have to make sure that we abide by our laws .
We have to make sure that we abide by our values.â€ �
He criticizes Republican candidates for president .
â€œWhen
I hear some candidates saying we should carpet bomb innocent civiliansâ€ �
â€ “ Ted Cruz â€ “
â€œthat is not a productive solution.â€ � â€œWhen
I hear someone saying that we should ban all Muslims from entering the countryâ€ �
â€ “ Donald Trump â€
“
â€œthat is not a good solution.â€
�
He boasts of his own record fighting terrorism .
â€œThere isnâ€ ™ t a president who has taken more terrorists off the map , â€ � he says , than him .
â€œIâ€ ™ m
the guy who calls the families , or meets with them or hugs them or tries to comfort a mom or a dad or a husband or a kid after a terrorist attack .
â€
¦
This is my number one job.â€ �
Then he repeats an argument he made after the Brussels attacks , while he was on a historic diplomatic trip to Cuba .
â€œIt has been my view consistently : the job of the terrorists in their minds is to induce panic , induce fear , get societies to change you they
are.â€ �
But he says : â€œYou canâ€ ™ t change us .
You can kill some of us but we will hunt you down and we will get you.â€ �
â€œAnd in the meantime , just as we did in Boston after the marathon bombing , weâ€ ™ re going to go to a ball game .
Thatâ€ ™ s the message of resilience.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s over to ABC â€
“ home , if you didnâ€ ™ t know , of the great Gore Vidal - William F Buckley debates of 1968 , which essentially created what we know of confrontational , partisan , shouty talk show political TV today .
So you can blame those two for what follows , if you want .
Bernie Sanders is here with George Stephanopoulos , live and in person :
â€œHereâ€ ™ s the point , George :
in the last three and a half weeks we have reduced her margin by her third .
We are moving to New York , Pennsylvania , California , Oregon â€
“ a lot of big states .
We believe we have the momentum.â€ �
Stephanopoulos asks if he is planning a floor fight at the convention ?
Sanders dodges , saying itâ€ ™ s really about making sure we defeat â€œTrump , Cruz or whoeverâ€ � .
But he is most qualified to do so , he says .
Of his heated disagreements with Clinton , Sanders says the Clinton campaign has decided to take the gloves off , not him .
Asked about his suggestion Clinton is not qualified for the presidency , he mentions â€
“ of course he does â€ “ Iraq , super pacs , trade agreements , fracking , the minimum wage .
And of Bill Clinton and criminal justice reform , a hot topic this week , discussion turns to the 1994 crime bill Sanders himself supported .
â€œIt had good and bad things in itâ€ � , Sanders says , suggesting if he hadnâ€ ™ t voted for the bill measures within it such as assault weapons bans â€ “ in the Senate bill , Stephanopoulos says , not the House where Bernie was â€ “ and violence against women would now be brought against him .
Interesting exchange .
But Bernieâ€ ™ s main problem , he says , is with Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s language about â€œyoung blacksâ€ �
â€ “
the â€œsuperpredatorâ€ � issue .
ABC then play tape of Sandy Hook families slamming Sanders over his gun control record .
Sensibly , he avoids confrontation : â€œLet me just say this , Bernie Sanders comes from a state with virtually no gun control .
I am a D- from the NRA.â€ �
He details his support for President Obamaâ€ ™ s gun control efforts .
He wonâ€ ™ t apologise for his opposition to legislation on liability for gunmakers , though .
His taxes ?
â€œMy wife does our taxes and sheâ€ ™ s been out on the campaign , sheâ€ ™ s been pretty busy .
But weâ€ ™ ll get them out.â€ �
Is New York
a must win ?
He wonâ€
™ t say so , but he thinks he has a chance .
Barack Obama is on Fox News , speaking with Chris Wallace for the first time on the show as president .
The interview was taped at the University of Chicago Law School , where Obama taught for a decade and recently spoke about his supreme court nomination , Merrick Garland .
Thatâ€ ™ s what Wallace asks about first :
Republican opposition to any nominee .
â€œI think that thingsâ€ ™ ll evolve as people get familiar with Judge Garlandâ€ ™ s record , as it becomes apparent that the overwhelming majority of the American people believe that the president nominates somebody to the supreme court and the Senate should do its job and give him a hearing.â€ � â€œThe questioning thatâ€ ™ s being done privately with Judge Garland should be done publicly , in a hearing , â€ � he adds .
â€œDemocrats and Republicans have gotten into a fix inside the Senate in which the confirmation promise becomes too much of a tit for tat.â€ �
But this scenario is unprecedented , he says .
â€œNever has a Republican presidentâ€ ™ s nominee not received a hearing , not received a vote .
I donâ€ ™ t object to Republicans saying Merrick Garland may be a fine man , may be a fine judge , but I disagree with him philosophically.â€
�
â€œI think if they go through the process they wonâ€ ™ t have a rationale to defeat him.â€
�
Obama says he will stand with Merrick Garland through the end of his term , no matter what the Senate does or who wins the presidential election .
Donald Trump is shying away from national television , but has given an interview with the billionaire and radio show host John Catsimatidis .
He went after Ted Cruz , who swept the floor with Trump at the Colorado convention .
â€œCruz is a guy who hates New York .
He hates New Yorkers , and heâ€ ™ s trying to put a different spin on it , â€ �
Trump said .
The businessman noted that Cruz voted against disaster relief for the north - east after Hurricane Sandy in 2012 , but supported federal aid for Texas after it suffered floods in 2015 .
Cruz has also criticized â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � , which he has vaguely defined as liberalism .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a very anti - New York guy , and I guarantee if he ever made it to president , New York would forget about the federal government , â€ �
Trump said .
Heâ€ ™ s also doing media criticism of newspapers that publish full transcripts of their interviews with him .
Finally the CNN host asks Sanders about his campaignâ€ ™ s chances against such a large deficit of pledged delegates and superdelegates .
â€œI think we have a path to getting more pledged delegates , â€ � Sanders says .
He argues that should his campaign continue to poll better than Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election , â€œI think a lot of those superdelegates will say whatâ€ ™ s most important is we donâ€ ™ t have a Trump in the White House.â€ � â€œIf neither candidate ends up not having the votes they need , yeah , sure , â€ � he says , there will be
â€œa discussionâ€ � about the nomination at the convention .
Tapper asks Sanders about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , and the senatorâ€ ™ s criticism of how Israel handled its last war with Gaza , in which more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed and 66 Israeli soldiers and seven civilians were killed in Israel .
â€œWas Israelâ€
™ s
response disproportionate ?
I think it was , â€ � Sanders says .
Israel â€œhas the right to live in freedom , independently , and in security , without having to be subjected to terrorist attacks , â€ � he goes on .
â€œBut I think we will note succeed in bringing peace to that region unless we also treat the Palestinians with dignity and respect.â€ �
Tapper starts to say that this is a remarkably â€œcriticalâ€ � position for a Jewish politician , and Sanders says
itâ€ ™ s
â€œa more balanced positionâ€ � .
â€œWhether yourâ€ ™ e Jewish or not Jewish , I would hope that every person in this country wants to see the misery of never ending , warring conflict in the Middle Eastâ€ � come to an end , he says .
Sanders describes himself as â€œsomeone who is absolutely pro - Israeli , absolutely 100 % supports Israelâ€ ™ s right to exist in peace and securityâ€ � .
â€œBut you can not ignore the needs of the Palestinian people , â€ � he says , noting the poverty and enormous destruction of Gaza .
Bernie Sanders is next up on CNN , also via a pre - taped interview .
This one was held along the East River in Brooklyn .
Jake Tapper â€œI appreciate Bill Clinton being my psychoanalyst ,
thatâ€ ™ s always nice , â€ � Sanders jokes .
â€œEver since Wisconsin , when that became the sixth out of seven states that we have won , â€ � he says , the Clinton campaign has become â€œvery negativeâ€ � .
â€œWe are going to fight back , he says , though he still intends to run an â€œissues - oriented campaignâ€ � .
Then he questions her vote for the Iraq war and her highly paid speeches to Wall Street firms .
â€œI have my doubts about what kind of president she would make.â€ �
But he says he would still support her as the Democratic nominee .
â€œWe will do everything possible to prevent a Donald Trump or some other Republican from entering the White House.â€ �
Tapper tries to ask about Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s confrontation with black protesters in Philadelphia .
Sanders refuses to criticize the former president or the former secretary of state , noting that she has expressed regret for using the phrase â€œsuper predatorâ€ � .
â€œNot gon na go there , sorry ,
Jake!â€ �
The CNN host then asks Clinton about a few of the issues : minimum wage is first , apropos a law just signed in New York to increase the wage to $ 15 .
â€œI have been in favor of whatâ€ ™ s called the fight for $ 15 for a year .
I have been supportive of the unions and activists and officials who come together , â€ � Clinton says .
The Sanders campaign has characterized Clinton as coming late to the issue .
Clinton adds that she supports â€œa phase - inâ€ � process for states , and that she wants to make the national minimum wage $ 12 .
â€œBut I want to encourage places , both locally and statewide , to go further.â€ �
Tapper moves on , asking the former secretary of state about Israel and its conflict with Hamas and Palestinians .
Clinton says she supports Israelâ€ ™ s right to self - defense .
â€œIt did not go seeking this , it was promoted by Hamas.â€ �
Then itâ€ ™ s a remark by Sandersâ€ ™ campaign manager
that Clintonâ€ ™ s
foreign policy contributed to the rise of the terror group Isis .
â€œThat is beyond absurd , â€ � Clinton says .
â€œYou know , theyâ€ ™ re saying a lot of things these days and Iâ€ ™ m going to let them choose to say whatever they choose to say.â€
�
And finally itâ€
™ s back to campaign politics .
Is Clinton preparing for a possible contested convention , which Sanders ( and Republicans ) seem to want ?
She says sheâ€ ™ s â€œleading [ Sanders ] in the popular vote , leading him in pledged delegatesâ€ � â€ “ not worried .
â€œI feel good about the next contest and I expect to be the nominee.â€ � Clinton concludes by saying she wants Americans to start thinking about her ideas versus those of a Republican .
â€œEither Donald Trump or Ted Cruz would be a terrible choice for America , so we need to run a unified Democratic campaign.â€ �
Hillary Clinton is first on the shows this morning , with a pre - taped interview with CNNâ€ ™ s
Jake Tapper on State of the Union .
Tapper asks Clinton whether she has any doubst about what kind of president Bernie Sanders would be , and whether she would support him as the nominee .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve said repeatedly that Iâ€ ™ d take him over Donald Trump or Ted Cruz any day ,
â€ � she says .
â€œNo , I donâ€ ™ t .
I donâ€ ™ t have anything negative to say about him.â€
�
Then Tapper asks about Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s confrontation with protesters of his legacy on crime and welfare reform , and of his wifeâ€ ™ s 1996 about â€œsuper predatorâ€ � gang leaders .
He also made a series of claims about his presidency that my colleague Mona Chalabi fact - checked ( see the link below ) , when pressed about the huge increase in incarceration after his 1994 crime bill was signed .
â€œI think what Bill said is we should all be listening to each other , â€ �
Clinton tells Tapper , adding that she says she wants to end the era of mass incarceration .
â€œThere were a lot of people very scared and concerned about high crime back in the day , and now we have to say OK , and deal with the consequences .
And one of the consequences is people who should not be in the criminal justice system.â€ �
She says she wants to â€œdivert people from the criminal justice systemâ€ � toward addiction treatment or relevant programs .
Then Clinton defends her husband , saying heâ€ ™ s â€œnot only a former president , heâ€ ™ s my husband.â€ �
â€œI think he has a great legacy , and if weâ€ ™ re going to talk about those eight years we should talk about everything.â€ �
The former president say he â€œalmostâ€ � wanted to apologize for the way he handled the confrontation .
â€œClearly some things happened that were not foreseen and need to be addressed , â€ � she continues .
â€œYou never do something and donâ€ ™ t keep asking : is it working?â€

Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the 2016 race for New York ,
the day after Ted Cruz swept Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s shambles of a campaign in Colorado , and after Bernie Sanders edged out Hillary Clinton in the Wyoming caucuses .
Cruz won all 34 delegates that Colorado has to offer a Republican candidate , his well - organized campaign a model of contrast to Trumpâ€ ™ s haphazard effort and the convention itself .
Hundreds of delegates took turns asking to be elected , pitching Coloradans things like â€œDonald Trump !
Buy Colorado weed!â€ � and â€œthe only person better to be president than Ted Cruz is Jesus Christ , and Jesus Christ is not a natural born citizenâ€ � .
By nightâ€ ™ s end , someone had accessed the state partyâ€ ™ s Twitter account and wrote what many Republicans have been hoping for weeks : â€œWe did it .
# NeverTrumpâ€ � .
The New York businessman has kept an atypically low profile on the campaign trail , and has reorganized his campaign to include a new â€œconvention managerâ€ � , Paul Manafort , to counter Cruzâ€ ™ s climb in the delegate race .
Manafort worked for Gerald Ford in the brokered Republican convention in 1976 , and more recently for a twice - ousted , Kremlin - backed leader of Ukraine and a Filipino dictator .
John Kasichâ€ ™ s campaign boasted about opening an office in Delaware .
In New York , Sanders and Clinton held rival events as they eye the stateâ€ ™ s 291 delegates .
Sandersâ€ ™ victory in Wyoming was slimmer than polls predicted , and he and Clinton each won seven delegates .
The former secretary of state retains more than 200 pledged delegates ahead of Sanders , who is hoping to cut sharply into that lead with a strong performance in New York .
He has struggled , however , to win over superdelegates , the party officials who are not bound to vote according to their statesâ€ ™ results , and who have overwhelmingly chosen Clinton .
Sanders and Clinton will both appear on television this morning .
The former says the revolution is growing and Clinton should watch out ,
the latter that itâ€ ™ s time for Americans to think about her versus a Republican .
Cruz , Kasich and the mysterious Manafort will also appear , to talk about a possible contested convention and the chaos of the Republican party .
Trump isnâ€ ™ t on the schedule , but he has a way of showing up anyway .
And President Barack Obama is the special guest on Fox News this morning , giving a rare one - on - one interview with the conservative network ."
2016-04-11,"Thanks everyone , thatâ€ ™ s it for this evening .
Iâ€ ™ ve attended a Bernie Sanders and a Donald Trump rally in Albany this afternoon / evening , which is too much excitement for one person for one day .
Just a look at the dayâ€ ™ s top stories : Trump attracted over 10,000 people to his Albany rally , with a few scuffles with protesters and Trump criticizing the Colorado delegate selection process as â€œriggedâ€ � after Ted Cruz got all the stateâ€ ™ s delegates .
Bernie Sanders hosted two rallies today - one in Albany , one in Buffalo - both attracting thousands as he tries to build momentum ahead of the upcoming New York primary .
Vice president Joe Biden declines to endorse anyone for president , but does say : â€œI would like to see a woman electedâ€ � ( ahem , thereâ€ ™ s only one female running ) .
Bill Clinton proves a strong boost for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign , since he can talk past experience and charm .
And tomorrow weâ€ ™ ll do it all over again .
Until then !
Colorado senator Cory Gardner went on a tweet storm tonight after Donald Trump claimed that Coloradoâ€ ™ s delegate selection process was rigged in his speech in Albany , New York Monday night .
Trump who was shut out of all 34 delegates elected in the Rocky Mountain State claimed that Coloradoâ€ ™ s state convention and district convention were rigged and bemoaned â€œwe found out in Colorado this is not a democracy like weâ€ ™ re supposed to have.â€ �
Trump had almost no organization in Colorado , a state his campaign had long expected to lose , and handed out incorrect sample ballots .
He called the process â€œa crooked dealâ€ � in an interview with Fox earlier on Monday as well .
Gardner erupted on Twitter , mocking Trump and deriding his effort in the state as well as his â€œtemper tantrum.â€ � RNC Chair Reince Priebus weighed in more meekly , noting simply that the rules had long been set .
Video from inside the Albany rally today shows protesters getting ejected from Trumpâ€ ™ s rally ( one of several times throughout the event that protesters got the boot ) .
Tonight electrician Stephen J Erickson , 52 , took his son Stephen H Erickson , 14 , along to the Donald Trump rally in Albany .
â€œI thought it was really cool .
He doesnâ€ ™ t seem corrupt , heâ€ ™ s not like a politician , â€ � said the younger Erickson , a big politics fan .
His dad is a fan for a simple reason .
â€œHeâ€ ™ ll build a wall .
And keep the legal people here and the illegal people out .
Theyâ€ ™ re going ... over the fence and under the fence .
Weâ€ ™ ve got legal Asians here , and legal Mexicans here .
They donâ€ ™ t want the illegals coming over , â€ � he said .
He mentioned that many Muslims in the US donâ€ ™ t want undocumented immigrants coming in - and said the temporary ban on Muslims would be a good thing .
â€œThey did that with the Irish and the Chinese and the Japanese , â€ � said his son , agreeing with the ban .
However , the son is too young to vote and the elder Erickson is a registered Democrat - so wonâ€ ™ t vote for Trump in the upcoming New York primary .
From The Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino in Buffalo tonight ...
After three false starts , a tuft of unruly white hair finally emerged from a sea of fresh - faced supporters .
Bernie Sanders strode confidently to the podium and leaned forward , hands grasping the sides , eyes scanning the university stadium where more than 6,000 supporters encircled him .
Sanders pumped a fist in the air and the thunderous applause became impossibly louder .
Outside , 5,000 more people who had sloshed through the wrap - around line to see him were not let into the arena .
â€œI
canâ€ ™ t believe how many people are here , â€ � he said , explaining that he had just come from greeting the supporters who stayed to watch a broadcast of the senatorâ€ ™ s speech .
â€œThis is a campaign on the move and your presence here tonight tells me how much energy and enthusiasm we have , â€ � he said .
The crowd banged their feet on the stadium seats and cheered .
The New York primary will be a consequential one for the Vermont senator who needs a strong showing , if not a win here , to prove his campaign has the momentum to justify a fight to the end .
Sanders has won eight of the last nine nominating contests , yet has hardly dented Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s significant delegate lead .
On Monday night , Sanders drew boos from the audience when he mentioned his opponentâ€ ™ s ties to Wall Street and hearty laughs when he called on her to release the transcripts of the paid speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs and other big banks .
The speech must have been good to get such a high speaking fee , Sanders chided , posturing whether it was written in â€œShakespearean proseâ€ � .
â€œBuffalo , â€ � Sanders carried on the joke .
â€œAre you ready for this dramatic announcement ?
I am prepared to release all of the transcripts of all of the speeches â€ ¦ Thatâ€ ™
s pretty easy .
There were no speeches.â€
�
The crowd roared with laughter .
Sanders went on to hit Clinton for taking money from super PACs , her vote to authorize the war in Iraq and her positions on fracking and trade .
â€œI voted against every one of these disastrous agreements , â€ �
Sanders said , goading cheers from a crowd of Buffalo residents battered by manufacturing job losses .
â€œSecretary Clinton supported virtually every trade policy.â€ �
But the loudest boos were reserved for the great Republican provocateur : Donald Trump , who was holding a rally in the stateâ€ ™ s capital at the same time .
â€œI know a lot of Americans are worried about Donald Trump ,
â€ �
Sanders said .
â€œIt ainâ€ ™ t going to happen ... because national poll after national poll , we defeat Trump by double digits
but it is also not going to happen because the American people understand that our strength is in our diversity and we will not allow Donald Trump to divide us up.â€
� Drawing his hour - long speech to a close , Sanders encouraged New Yorker to vote , promising them that with a large voter turn out , â€œwe are going to win.â€ � â€œOn April 19,â€
�
Sanders said , making his closing pitch , â€œNew York can make history .
Letâ€ ™ s do it!â€ �
Have just arrived in my hotel in Albany - there is free cheese and salami ! - and am tuning in to John Kasichâ€ ™ s Town Hall on CNN right now .
First thing I hear is his daughter Reese , saying : â€œHe also thinks heâ€ ™ s a really good dancerâ€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve gotten better!â€
� said Kasich .
â€œYeah ,
but youâ€ ™ re not going to go on Dancing with the Stars , â€ � quipped his teenage daughter .
Then CNNâ€ ™ s Anderson Cooper quizzes how Kasich handles his twin teenage daughters bringing boys home .
â€œWell , we have a trooper who sits in the car with a gun , â€ � replied Kasich .
Literally no teenager would want their parent to be president .
Letâ€ ™ s all give a thought to Sasha and Malia Obama .
I just interviewed several attendees from the Donald Trump Albany rally outside the Times Union Center - including a 14-year - old , a 17-year - old , a Ted Cruz supporter , a registered Democrat and a registered Green Party supporter ( who supports John Kasich ) .
Meaning , none of them will be voting for Donald Trump in the New York primary , although they were part of the 10,000 + crowd at tonightâ€ ™ s rally .
Not to say people there wonâ€ ™ t vote for Trump - a big chunk of them will .
But at least one - Pete Palleschi , 19 , a Hudson Valley Community College student who is a registered Green Party member and prefers John Kasich of the Republican left - admitted he was just â€œhere for the show.â€
� As well as covering the Bernie Sanders Buffalo rally
live this evening , The Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino just filed this report ...
Bernie Sanders campaign fired back at Hillary Clinton for suggesting that the guns used to commit crimes in New York flow from the senatorâ€ ™ s Vermont .
In an emailed statement , subject line : â€œClinton misfires , â€ � Sandersâ€ ™ spokesman Michael Briggs deferred to remarks from the stateâ€ ™ s governor , who has endorsed Clinton for president .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know why Secretary Clinton would be so critical of the governor of Vermont who strongly supports her candidacy , â€ � Briggs said .
â€œWhat Gov [ Peter ]
Shumlin recently said is true :
â€˜It is campaign season , therefore , things are sometimes said by all the candidates that sometimes arenâ€ ™ t entirely accurate .
I would just say this ,
I think youâ€ ™ d have a hard time convincing Vermonters that New Yorkâ€ ™ s crime problems are coming from Vermont.â€ ™ â€ �
During a panel on gun violence prevention on Monday , Clinton said : â€œMost of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state .
And the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New Yorkâ€ � is Vermont.â€ �
Clinton has long hammered Sanders for his record on guns , one of the only issues she has been able to position herself to the left of the progressive senator .
This however was the first time she has used this line of attack tying Sanderâ€ ™ s hunter - friendly home state to gun violence in New York .
Clintonâ€ ™ s statistics come from a 2013 Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) report , that found the state of Vermont had the highest per - capita source of guns recovered in other states , in large part due to its small population and lax gun laws .
And according to a 2014 ATF report , 55 guns found in New York to Vermont , less than 1 % of the roughly 7,686 that were recovered , ( though only 4,585 of those guns were traceable to a state ) .
By comparison , 395 were traced to Virginia .
More from The Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino , in Buffalo tonight for Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ rally .
John Kasichâ€ ™ s daughters record a little video teaser for their interview on CNN with their Ohio Governor father tonight at 9 pm ET .
Conservative icon Phyllis Schafly may be ousted from the Eagle Forum , the right wing group she founded in 1972 , over her support for Donald Trump .
Six of the groupâ€ ™ s board members , including Schaflyâ€ ™ s daughter , reportedly held a conference call on Monday afternoon to discuss how to force the nonagenarian out of her position as president of the group .
In a statement posted on Facebook , Schafly wrote : At 2:00 pm today , 6 directors of Eagle Forum met in an improper , unprecedented telephone meeting .
I objected to the meeting and at 2:11pm , I was muted from the call .
The meeting was invalid under the Bylaws but the attendees purported to pass several motions to wrest control of the organization from me .
They are attempting to seize access to our bank accounts , to terminate employees , and to install members of their own Gang of 6 to control the bank accounts and all of Eagle Forum . . .
This kind of conduct will not stand and I will fight for Eagle Forum and I ask all men and women of good will to join me in this fight .
Schafly had earlier called on the six in question to resign as their push distracts important issues â€œfrom opposing abortion to defeating Common Coreâ€ � while warning that â€œthe Chinese Communists are on the move as Europe falters under its misguided policies of trade and immigration.â€ �
The conservative icon gained fame for her successful effort in the 1970s preventing the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) from being ratified .
The proposed constitutional amendment which stated â€œequality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sexâ€ � fell just short of the approval from 37 state legislatures it needed to become part of the Constitution .
Schafly became a national figure opposing it because it meant women would have to fight in the armed forces and her fear that it would disadvantage housewives .
Another protester - this time a young black woman - gets shouted at by the crowd to leave .
â€œI love you Albany ,
â€ �
Trump declares , before walking off stage to the beats of the Space Jam theme song , with its lyrics : â€œYâ€ ™ all ready for this.â€ � â€œIs there anybody in this room who is going to vote for someone other than Donald Trump?â€ � he asks .
He gets the crowd to do â€œthe pledgeâ€ � , where they raise their hands and promise to vote for Donald J Trump at the upcoming primary .
â€œDonâ€
™ t raise it too high!â€ � he warns ,
â€œthen they say itâ€ ™ s about something elseâ€ � ( usually the media point out that it looks very similar to a Nazi heil Hitler salute ... )
Hereâ€ ™ s one of the protesters getting removed from the Trump rally this evening .
â€œI get almost unanimous veteran support , â€ � said Trump , as he runs through talking points of his stump speech .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re going to be proud of that border , and be proud of the wall ...
Maybe itâ€ ™ ll be named the Trump Wall .
Weâ€
™ re going to take care of education , weâ€ ™ re going to get rid of Common Core.â€
�
Another protester just appeared in the crowd - this one removed by security guards directly in front of the press pen .
â€œHe stands there smiling because he knows heâ€ ™ s protected .
Donâ€ ™ t touch him , â€ � said Trump .
â€œThey stand there and they taunt us all .
The dishonest media will say Trump was very very tough and raised his voice , â€ � said Trump .
The protester , a youngish white guy wearing a Bernie Sanders t - shirt , was by himself .
I recorded some video , will try and post .
â€œWe owe $ 19 trillion .
Itâ€ ™ s going up to $ 21 trillion because of the horrible , horrible budget that three months ago the Republicans approved .
We funded in that budget Obamacare .
We funded in that budget people coming in from Syriaâ€ ¦ we funded in that budget all sorts of things , including people coming into our country illegally .
Did you know we take care of illegal immigrants in some cases better than we take care of our veterans?â€ � said Trump .
Trump jumps all over the place when he gives a speech - from ISIS to healthcare to NY elections .
Before Trump appeared on stage , an announcement was made that if any protesters appeared , that Trump supporters
shouldnâ€
™ t touch them but they should hold their posters up and chant â€œTrumpâ€ � to alert authorities ( a confusing security technique ) .
Well , a protester appeared and Trump yelled â€œGet â€˜em out!â€ � to loud cheers .
The Guardian canâ€
™ t see the protester and is trapped in the press pen .
Trump then said â€œDonâ€ ™ t hurt her , donâ€ ™ t hurt her , â€ � before adding - about the presence of protesters -
â€œbut it does make it exciting , right?â€ � .
He questioned if protesters were paid , said he suspected they were .
Five minutes later , more appear .
â€œThe only way the cameras show how many people are at a place like that is when they show a protester ... otherwise these crooked people , they never show how many people are in the area , â€ � said Trump .
Thereâ€ ™ s around 10,000 people here tonight at Trumpâ€ ™ s Albany rally in the Times Union Center .
Not many empty seats at all .
Stadium full and the crowd standing on the floor .
Now he talks about his fellow candidates .
â€œTalk about liars ?
I think Hillary might be worse than Ted !
I am no fan of Bernie Sanders , I can tell you that .
Although we can agree on one thing : trade .
The difference is , I can do something about it , â€ � said Trump .
â€œSo hereâ€ ™ s the problem .
Weâ€ ™ re millions of votes ahead of Cruz .
Millions .
You donâ€
™ t hear that .
These dishonest people up here ,
donâ€ ™ t tell you , â€ � said Trump , pointing to the cameras and media crew in front of him .
Crowd is now booing the media .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re terrible .
I just watched a report from CNN , it was so dishonest , â€ � said Trump .
â€œFuck
you CNN ,
â€ � yells a guy holding a Trump sign .
â€œThe media itself is so dishonest ...
Iâ€ ™ m hundreds of delegates ahead .
But the system is rigged ....
itâ€ ™ s a dirty system .
Only a non - politician will say it.â€ �
And Donald Trump appears on stage to the beats of the Space Jam themesong , Get Ready for This by 2 Unlimited .
The national anthem is now being sung , by the same singer who led the crowd with God Bless America .
She is a little wobbly on the high notes but the crowd appreciates the effort .
Carl Paladino , a local Trump - like figure , spoke for about 20 minutes , getting large cheers .
â€œMost of the people in the room have never been part of a revolution .
But this is how it begins , â€ � said Paladino , noting that yesterday he was in Rochester and that the people there were the same as the people here .
â€œThis political correctness .
God forbid if you say Merry Christmas , â€ � he said , noting that the president bans it being said ( not a presidential executive order Iâ€ ™ m currently aware of ) .
Paladino speaks out against the press , saying they think theyâ€ ™ re better than everyday people .
â€œScrew the press!â€ � yelled out a young guy in a Make America Great Again cap at Trumpâ€ ™ s Albany rally , who laughed good - naturedly when I turned around to look at him .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino is in Buffalo , New York for a Bernie Sanders rally this evening .
Sheâ€ ™ ll be filing later , but hereâ€ ™ s some live updates .
Hereâ€ ™ s a look at protesters outside the Trump rally in Albany .
Thatâ€ ™ s at least three times the size of the demonstrator crowd when I came inside the rally about two hours ago .
â€œOK question : are we going to build a wall?â€
� said Carl Paladino , to cheers of â€œyes.â€
�
â€œAre we going to make the Mexicans pay for it?â€ � asked Paladino .
The crowd cheers yes .
The crowd is now chanting â€œbuild that wallâ€ � while Carl Paladino is trying to encourage an â€œAvaâ€ � chant , which is the name of a small girl .
Now thereâ€ ™ s an â€œAvaâ€ ™ s momâ€ � chant happening , for her mother , Jennifer Oberting , known as Jennifer C from The Apprentice Season Two .
Oberting is now talking about how she only heard from the campaign last night that she would appear .
â€œItâ€
™ s very overwhelming , â€ � she said .
â€œ[But ] when I look around the room , I see friendly faces.â€ � â€œTrump fired me 10 years ago .
He had to do his job , â€ � said Oberting .
She said her 15 minutes of fame lasts longer because of her association with the billionaire .
â€œWhen the name Donald Trump is attached to your 15 minutes , it never really dies .
It follows you ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œThere are two Donald Trumps - and maybe a few more , â€ �
she said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to fill the room .
Youâ€ ™ re going to get exactly what you wanted when you .
He commands the room .
He is the commander - and - chief , with all due respect.â€ �
â€œItâ€ ™ s time we had a commander - and - chief , and
thatâ€ ™ s
the first Donald I experienced , â€ �
she said .
She says the second Trump is a â€œfunnyâ€ � guy - he tells â€œsome dirty jokes , some funny jokes , â€ � recalling a photoshoot in Vogue
they did together where he made a joke about her hair .
Confusingly , the lady is singing God Bless America for a second time after Carl Paladino said â€œone more time ?
One more time!â€ � .
Carl Paladino , the 2010 candidate for New York governor , is here at the Trump rally , saying
our â€œfriendâ€ � Trump is on his way .
Someone just led us through the pledge of allegiance and now a lady is singing God Bless America .
A 4,000-strong crowd of Bernie Sanders supporters packed into the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany today to cheer the Vermont Senator - with another 2,000 unable to enter .
A group of young people played hacky sack before the rally .
Many carried homemade signs - including one that said â€œBern down for whatâ€ � and a duo carrying hand - painted flame signs .
It was a young , hippyish crowd - mainly white and lots of folksy knitted beanies .
The crowd regularly chanted â€œfeel the bernâ€ � and â€œwhose revolution ?
Our revolution!â€ �
â€œHeâ€ ™ s the greatest candidate that has ever run for president while I was conscious of politics , â€ � said Maria Scarangella , 26 , a social worker from New Paltz , who wore a â€œfeel the Bernâ€ � cap .
â€œThis is the first time Iâ€ ™ ve felt inspired to get involved.â€ � Radio announcer Jim Hightower , wearing his trademark cowboy hat , addressed the crowd and called Sanders â€œa candidate with an FDR sized vision of what American can be.â€ � Senator Bill Perkins and NY state Assemblyman Phil Steck both addressed the crowd , giving the Sandersâ€ ™ campaign some local political heft , in a state where many are strong Clinton supporters .
Finally Sanders appeared , with the crowd going absolutely bananas at his arrival , cheering and stamping .
â€œAlbany thank you very much .
This is a large , proud and raucous crowd .
And a very loud crowd!â€ � he said .
â€œBrothers and sisters
this is a campaign on the move .
This is a campaign that has the momentum .
This is a campaign that has won eight out of the last nine caucuses , â€ � he said .
Sanders spoke about how latest polls had him able to beat Hillary Clinton and beating Donald Trump in the general election by double digits .
â€œWe have the guts to be honest with the American people and tell the truth , â€ � said Sanders .
He then spoke about the corrupt campaign finance system , the rigged economy and how the media has ignored him .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got to determine what the real issues are , not CNN or ABC , â€ � said Sanders .
He went on to speak about the need for a reasonable living wage , the high hours that Americans work , and that 58 % of all new income is going to the top 1 % .
Sanders spoke about how on Thursday night he will board a plane to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis and noted the head of the Catholic Church has been a leader in talking about income inequality and the concept of a â€œmoral economy.â€
�
The biggest cheer for his stump speech came when he declared â€œthis campaign is listening to women.â€ �
After 10 seconds of screaming and cheers , Sanders quipped â€œThis is a loud crowd!â€ � Abigail Ritter , a graphic designer , painted a â€œBern Baby Bernâ€ � baby carrier for her 19-month old son Isaac .
The 39-year - old mother has known Sanders as a friend her familyâ€ ™ s worked on the Sanders campaign at the US House of Representatives , but this was the first time she was seeing him speak live at a rally , and she loved the growing Bernie - mentum .
â€œI think that Bernie has been ignored by popular media since heâ€ ™ s been in office , â€ � said Ritter .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s been one of the leaders in the Senate since heâ€ ™ s been in office and heâ€
™ s been one of the few to reach across the aisles .
Thatâ€ ™ s his big attraction
- he doesnâ€
™ t stick his feet firmly in the ground , heâ€ ™ s willing to listen to everybody and come up with real solutions.â€
� Ben Carson - the former neurosurgeon and failed Republican candidate - is only backing Trump because he thinks he has the best chance to beat the Democrats .
â€œIt was pragmatism , recognizing that John Kasich can not win without a brokered convention â€ ” which would guarantee a Democrat win â€ ” and recognizing that Ted Cruz can bring conservatives but will have a very difficult time bringing moderates and Democrats , â€ �
Carson told radio show Kelley and Kafer last week , Buzzfeed reports .
â€œI think that will be pretty much a guaranteed loss also .
So in terms of who can potentially win , I think that would be Donald Trump .
When I look at the consequences of not winning , itâ€ ™ s too horrible to even think about.â€ �
The host Krista Kafer said she wouldnâ€ ™ t back Trump if heâ€ ™ s the nominee .
Carson said heâ€ ™ d do the same thing if he wasnâ€ ™ t thinking about his kids .
â€œFor me
, itâ€ ™ s about the children and the grandchildren , â€ � said Carson .
â€œIf
it was just me , I would be completely where Krista is .
I would say , â€˜hey , I got this
, I can deal with it , â€ ™
but for them , I canâ€ ™ t.â€

Good afternoon folks , this is Amber Jamieson from the Times Union Center in Albany , where the crowd is just beginning to fill in for tonightâ€ ™ s Donald Trump rally .
I just walked the 10 minutes through New York state government buildings from Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ rally at the Washington Avenue Armory , where around 4,500 people crammed in ( 2,000 overflow outside ) to hear the Senator from Vermont speak .
It was rock concert - loud , those Bernistas really know how to yell .
Iâ€ ™ ll file a little more shortly about that event , while waiting for Trumpâ€ ™ s 7 pm rally to kick off .
â€œIt took me , like , fiiive swipesâ€ � :
A Mic News interviewer lures vice president Joe Biden onto a limb that , to his media handlers , sounds dangerously close to a Hillary Clinton endorsement .
â€œI would like to see a woman elected , â€ �
Biden tells the interviewer .
â€œBreak!â€
� yells one
handlerâ€ �
â€œThatâ€ ™ s it!â€
� announces a second .
â€œNo no no , thatâ€ ™
s alright , â€ � Biden says .
But then he clarifies that he and the president are not endorsing anyone .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , whose 1975 victory over Lou Ferrigno in the Mr Olympia competition is documented in Pumping Iron , is an outspoken John Kasich supporter .
But it turns out Ferrigno , who went on to play The Incredible Hulk on TV , likes Trump :
â€œheâ€ ™ s a fair guyâ€ � .

Noise for Sanders in Albany :
John Kasich has kicked off a campaign event in Troy , New York , just north of Albany : Bill Clinton sought to move past a confrontation with black protesters while stumping for Hillary Clinton in New York City over the weekend , conceding amid stops in Harlem and Queens that the 1994 tough - on - crime bill he signed into law as president â€œoverdid itâ€ � and threw too many non - violent offenders into lengthy prison sentences , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Sabrina Siddiqui and David Smith
: Clinton drew headlines last week while campaigning for his wife in Philadelphia , vigorously hitting back at activists who had arrived to protest about his record on criminal justice .
Although he issued a semi - apology the following day , the incident cast a spotlight once more on how Clintonâ€ ™ s legacy has served , in some ways , as a double - edged sword for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s 2016 presidential bid .
But while speaking at an event in Hellâ€ ™ s Kitchen , New York , on Sunday , Clinton proved that he remains a great asset for his wifeâ€ ™ s campaign â€ “ blending obvious star quality and the ability to communicate almost willfully detailed policy arguments in a way that still keeps an audience hanging on his every word .
He also spoke in more nuanced terms of the 1994 crime bill , touting its benefits while acknowledging its unintended consequences , and highlighting Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s own platform to reform the criminal justice system .
â€œWe need prison reform , â€ � Clinton told worshippers at the Abyssinian Baptist church in Harlem .
â€œWe overdid it and put too many young , non - violent offenders in jail for too long .
The federal government can set an example.â€ � Read the full piece here .
Sanders has taken the stage in Albany : [ He means primaries and caucuses ]
Hillary Clinton is in Port Washington , New York â€ “ on Long Island â€
“ for an event on gun violence .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Jamiles Lartey is there : and Clinton has opened with a swipe at Sanders :
Itâ€ ™ s only April , but Rush Limbaugh , the radio personality , is already on to the third round of balloting at the Republican convention in Cleveland in late July .
Rushâ€ ™
s story is that Cruz blocks Trump in the first round of voting , but does not win a majority in the second round , and so is set aside in the third in favor of a party stalwart .
Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 12 points in the upcoming New York Democratic primary , according to a just - released poll from Monmouth University .
51 % of likely Democratic primary voters in New York support Clinton compared to 39 % who support Sanders , the poll found .
The poll notes that Clinton â€œstill receives largely positive marks from primary voters for her time in the Senate â€ “
28 % say she did an excellent job and 42 % say she did a good job , compared to 20 % who say she did an only fair job and just 7 % who say she did a poor job.â€ �
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Amber Jamieson has arrived at a Bernie Sanders rally at the Armory in Albany .
Sheâ€
™ s not alone
: Important update : Hillary Clinton has just taken questions from reporters after a campaign stop in Jackson Heights , Queens .
She indulged in a bit of pre - debate trash talk , saying that rival Bernie Sanders had had â€œtrouble answering questionsâ€ � â€œunder the bright spotlight and scrutiny here in New Yorkâ€ �
and she looked forward to their Thursday meeting at the Brooklyn Navy Yard .
In a 1 April interview with the New York Daily News Sanders was hesitant in his description of the legal authority of the president to identify banks as too - big - to - fail in a way that would trigger their dissection .
The Clinton campaign has attacked his hesitancy as ignorance , while others have said he was presenting an informed and inflected view .
Clinton said that while she was â€œfar ahead of him the popular vote , â€ � she would not call on Sanders to drop out of the nominating race and that she was â€œfor a good , tough , contest.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m going to run my campaign Iâ€
™ m going to make my case , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to keep working .
I do believe that we can not let Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s comments , his attacksâ€ � go unanswered .
Both partiesâ€ ™ nominating contests have been split by controversies over delegate selection and the feeling that the will of the voters is not wholly reflected in the shape of the race .

A retired White House gardener is selling Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s
1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass , which he bought at an auction for the residenceâ€ ™ s workers and has been sitting in his Pennsylvania garage for years , the AP reports : Mike Lawn , who worked at the White House for nearly three decades , bought the car in 2000 to give to his daughter when she turned 16 , but she wouldnâ€ ™ t drive it .
â€œShe said it looked like an old ladyâ€ ™ s car , â€ �
Lawn told The Evening Sun newspaper .
â€œShe didnâ€ ™ t know why it had cranks in the windows.â€

Donald Trump has posted video of an angry supporter in Colorado burning what he says is his Republican party registration form , after all the stateâ€ ™ s delegates went to Ted Cruz : The Bernie Sanders campaign has produced a new anti - fracking ad , touching on what has been a central issue for some upstate New York voters before the practice was banned last year .
Fracking refers to the hydraulic fracturing of rock for gas and oil extraction .
The practice is tied to unnatural seismic activity and has prompted pollution concerns .
The ad takes a swipe at Clinton , though not by name .
â€œWashington politicians protect oil companies , â€ � it asserts .
Sanders is the only candidate who opposes fracking everywhere , it says .
â€œHe
canâ€

Asked in an AP - GfK poll whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would be best at â€œmaking America great , â€ � more Americans picked Clinton , the news agency reports : Clintonâ€ ™ s edge over Trump on the issues spans foreign and domestic policy .
She holds a significant advantage on handling immigration , health care , the U.S. image abroad , filling Supreme Court vacancies , international trade and working with Congress .
Her biggest advantage is on handling gender equality issues , with 55 percent of Americans trusting her and just 12 percent backing Trump .
Clinton has a slimmer lead over Trump on which candidate is trusted to protect the country , with 37 percent backing the Democrat and 31 percent backing the Republican .
The margin is similar when Americans were asked who they trusted to handle the threat posed by the Islamic State group .
Much of Trumpâ€ ™ s appeal with voters has rested on his broad pledge to â€œmake America great again.â€ �
But when asked which candidate they trusted more to make the country great , 33 percent of Americans picked Clinton and 28 percent backed Trump .

Politicoâ€ ™ s Kyle Cheney points out that Trump , in a previous incarnation , used to razz Rick Santorumâ€ ™ s â€œineptâ€ � campaign for its weak delegates game , and to wave the party rulebook for selecting a nominee : Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says
heâ€ ™ s â€œthriftyâ€ � and is offering T - shirts for craft projects while asking donors to help pay off the $ 1.2 million debt from his short - lived presidential campaign
, writes the AP :
The Republican sent an email to donors Sunday saying , â€œif there is one thing the American people learned about me during our presidential campaign , it is that I am thrifty.â€ �
He cites his use of coupons and shopping at sales racks .
The email
doesnâ€ ™ t mention more than $ 90,000 a day
was spent on his 70-day presidential run .
Walkerâ€ ™ s email says anyone who donates $ 45 will receive a campaign T - shirt , but size and color requests wonâ€ ™ t be honored because of a lack of resources .
Walker says the shirts can be framed or used for â€œcrafty thingsâ€ � like a pillow or bag .
Saturday saw a victory for Bernie Sanders in caucuses in Wyoming â€ “ but he split the delegates evenly with rival Hillary Clinton , reported Dan Roberts and Lauren Gambino :
The Vermont senator finished 12 points ahead of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton with 56%-44 % of the vote in Wyoming , after a caucus that underlined his continued challenge to her among white voters drawn to his more radical economic platform .
The eventual margin of victory was slimmer than some pundits had anticipatedand fell short of his recent 58.9%-to-40.4 % win in neighbouring Colorado .
Nonetheless , it represented a convincing victory for a 74-year - old democratic socialist in one of the most conservative states the country .
In 2008 , Barack Obama defeated Clinton in Wyoming by 61 % to 38 % , but fewer than a fifth of registered voters in the state are Democrats .
Sanders has tended to fare better than Clinton in states using the caucus system rather than larger primary elections .
Hereâ€ ™ s a peek at team Bernie Sanders in New York , as campaign operations unfolded this weekend :
Donald Trump has been pretty good at winning Republican votes , but in the willfully complicated game of capturing delegates whose loyalty at the national convention he can count on , the frontrunner has shown less proficiency .
Trumpâ€ ™
s
troubles first emerged last month in Louisiana , where it appears that Ted Cruz will have a 10-delegate lead despite Trumpâ€ ™ s narrow victory in the stateâ€ ™ s primary .
Now Trump , in one weekend , has lost delegates battles in at least five and possibly six states .
If this tale of seemingly shifting delegates is confusing , thereâ€ ™ s
good reason : each state has its own set of rules for electing delegates , who participate in a nominating process that is itself defined by complicated rules that can change .
Sound rigged ?
Trump thinks so : A look at where and how Trump lost this weekend sheds light on some of the complexities of the process .
In Iowa , Cruz earned almost every delegate for grabs in the stateâ€ ™ s four congressional district conventions .
The Trump campaign had only urged supporters to attend the stateâ€ ™ s first - in - the - nation caucuses on 1 February and had made no attempt to encourage Trump supporters to be involved in electing delegates .
In Colorado , there was never a statewide Republican vote to determine a presidential preference , although there was a vote to elect delegates to a state convention where some national delegates would be elected .
The state convention happened at the weekend , and Trump lost the fight for all 13 delegates at stake .
In South Carolina , Republicans appeared to be selecting more national delegates loyal to Cruz than to Trump , despite Trumpâ€ ™ s 10-point victory in the stateâ€ ™ s primary in February .
The delegates are required to vote Trump in a first round of voting at the national convention â€ “
but in a second round , should one be required , and thereafter the delegates may vote for whomever they wish .
In Virginia , Cruz â€œedged out Trump in the convention in Virginiaâ€ ™ s ninth congressional district , â€ � reported Ben Jacobs .
Cruz won two delegates to Trumpâ€ ™ s one in an area where Trump won 47 % of the vote in the stateâ€ ™ s 1 March primary .
The delegates would be bound in a first round of voting at the national convention but not thereafter .
Indiana , where the Republican party machine has been loath to accept Trump , began selecting delegates from congressional districts before the stateâ€ ™ s 3 May primary .
As in South Carolina , the delegates have an anti - Trump bent , Time reported .
In Michigan , where Republicans held their state convention on Saturday , Trump and Ohio governor John Kasich were able to combine to win key slots on the rules committee and credentials committee and elect all the delegates they earned in the stateâ€ ™ s March primary .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign â€œbelieves they have installed loyalists in about five delegate slots among the 25 delegates pledged to Trump ,
â€ � the Time report said .
2013 :
long ago .
â€œThey feel very , very , guilty , â€ �
Donald Trump said of his two children , Ivanka and Eric , who are New York residents but who failed to register to vote in time for the stateâ€ ™ s 19 April primary .
Does the failure of the Trump children to register to vote in his home state bespeak a bigger problem with his campaignâ€ ™ s get - out - the - vote efforts ?
Trump is sailing as the frontrunner in New York , but he needs every vote he can muster if he is to cross the 50 % mark statewide and in each congressional district .
Any candidate who crosses that threshold gets all the delegates at stake .
If no candidate crosses the threshold , the delegates are awarded proportionally .
Hereâ€ ™ s Trumpâ€ ™ s phone interview with Fox on the topic , re - posted from the intro :
The Hillary Clinton camp released an ad Monday making the case that Clinton is the only candidate â€œtough enoughâ€ � to defeat Donald Trump in a general election match - up .
The ad , which will run in New York ahead of next weekâ€ ™ s primary , calls out Trump for saying that women who have abortions should be â€œpunishedâ€ � .
( He later sought to retract the remark . )
The ad also hits Trump for labeling Mexicans as rapists and for calling for a ban on Muslims seeking to enter the US .
â€œDonald
Trump says we can solve Americaâ€ ™ s problems by turning against each other , â€ � Clinton says in the ad , titled Stronger Together .
â€œItâ€ ™ s wrong and it goes against everything
New York and America stands for.â€
�
The ad ends : â€œWith so much at stake , sheâ€ ™ s the one tough enough to stop Trump.â€ � Bernie Sanders also has a new ad , Bolder , referencing Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s sneer about Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œNew York valuesâ€ � .
Sanders , the ad says , is the â€œBrooklyn - born , native sonâ€ � candidate who embodies â€œvalues , forged in New Yorkâ€ � .
Sanders has argued that polls consistently show him defeating Trump in a potential general election match - up by a more decisive margin than Clinton , although some polling experts have said its too early to judge a general election matchup .
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
The race is on for New York : both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have stops planned in Albany , the capital , today , while Hillary Clinton is scheduled to speak about gun violence on Long Island .
Ohio governor John Kasich has two town hall events upstate .
Ted Cruz , meanwhile , has slipped away to the west coast for events in Orange County and San Diego , well in advance of the California primary on 7 June .
Clinton is out with a new ad targeting New Yorkers and pitching herself as the only Democrat strong enough to take on Trump .
Our Lauren Gambino will take a look shortly .
Trump decided at the weekend that politics is a dirty , corrupt business .
That was after he lost delegate fights in five states .
In some cases , such as in South Carolina , the state party chose some delegates likely to abandon Trump after the first round of voting at the national convention in July , should a second round be required , in spite of Trumpâ€ ™ s 10-point win in the stateâ€ ™ s February primary .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got a corrupt system , its not right ,
â€ �
Trump said at a rally in Rochester , New York on Sunday .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re supposed to be a democracy .
Weâ€ ™ re supposed to be you vote and the vote means something ... and weâ€ ™ ve got to do something
about it.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s critics blame his delegate slippage on what they say is his campaignâ€ ™ s disorganization and ignorance of party rules .
Trump revealed on Monday that two of his three children who live in New York did not know the rules for registering to vote in the state and so will not cast ballots in the 19 April primary .
Donald Jr is the new favorite ?
CNN , meanwhile , announced three town halls on consecutive nights this week , with the Republican candidates and their families :
On Monday 11 April , Ohio governor John Kasich will be joined by his wife Karen and daughters Reese and Emma .
On Tuesday , Trump will be joined by his wife Melania and children Ivanka , Eric , and Donald Jr.
On Wednesday , Texas senator Ted Cruz will be joined by his wife Heidi .
Each candidate and his family will speak with Anderson Cooper and take questions from an audience of registered Republican voters ."
2016-04-11,"Ted Cruz has hinted he will send Hillary Clinton to prison if he becomes the next US president .
The Republican candidate made the threat on Monday at a rally in Irvine , California , where he also declared that the state will decide the GOP nomination .
Cruz fired up the crowd with a vow to keep the Democratic frontrunner from the White House â€ “ and possibly behind bars .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve got slightly different government housing in mind for her ,
â€ � he said .
The Texas senator did not elaborate but the threat â€ “ the latest sign of intense polarisation â€
“ was a reference to the FBIâ€ ™ s investigation into Clintonâ€
™ s
use of a private email server while secretary of state .
It was unclear how serious he meant it but the audience in the Irvine hotel roared approval and snapped up â€œHillary for prisonâ€ � badges after the event , citing the email server and her alleged role in the death of four Americans at a US outpost in Libya in 2012 .
Cruz made a more obviously jokey reference last year to Clinton ending up in Leavenworth , a federal prison in Kansas .
Reviving the threat , or joke , played to the Republican baseâ€ ™ s loathing for the former first lady and underlined Cruzâ€ ™ s attempt to position himself as the partyâ€ ™ s best chance of beating her in Novemberâ€ ™ s election .
Audience members assumed Cruz was serious .
â€œIf Cruz gets in I think he will appoint an attorney general to indict her .
The server was patently illegal .
It violated the Espionage Act , â€ � said Robin Hall , 65 , a retired education administrator .
â€œApparently she broke the law , and it seems that under Obama the Justice Department is very politicised and doesnâ€ ™ t go after Democrats , â€ � said Michelle Markel , who accompanied her husband , Bob , 67 , who held a â€œWe love Lion Tedâ€ � poster .
Christopher Underwood , 31 , wearing a stars and stripes shirt and Duck Dynasty baseball cap , said Clinton deserved jail not just for the use of a private email server but criminal bungling .
â€œShe committed federal crimes .
People died in Benghazi .
She sent people to die.â€ �
A vendor outside the hall ran out of â€œHillary for prisonâ€ � badges within minutes of the speech ending .
They were selling well even before Cruz took to the podium .
â€œAt first people think it says â€˜Hillary for presidentâ€ ™ and itâ€ ™ s
â€˜oh noâ€ ™ ,â€ � said Jake Towe , a Cruz supporter who travelled with his father from Oklahoma to sell this and other badges .
â€œThen they look closer and itâ€ ™ s â€˜oh , I love itâ€
™
.â€ �
The use of a private server for official business has dogged Clinton , though she remains favoured to beat Bernie Sanders and clinch the Democratic nomination .
She has apologised for using the server while in office from 2009 to 2013 but denied wrongdoing .
At the FBIâ€ ™ s request the state department has suspended plans for an internal review of whether classified information was properly handled .
Jack Pitney , a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College , said just about any anti - Clinton comment would get a positive reaction from a GOP audience .
â€œBoth parties show an increasing tendency to view the other side not just as mistaken , but fundamentally evil .
As far back as 2007 , 35 % of Democrats thought that Bush knew about 9/11 in advance .
And now many Republicans see Clinton as part of a criminal conspiracy.â€ � Taking time off from campaigning for New Yorkâ€ ™ s 19 April primary to appear on the other side of the country in Orange county , followed by a scheduled stop later on Monday in San Diego , showed Cruzâ€ ™ s early focus on Californiaâ€ ™ s 7 June primary .
He also visited in late March for a fundraiser and to appear on Jimmy Kimmelâ€ ™ s ABC late - night talkshow .
Donald Trump , the GOP frontrunner , cancelled an event near Los Angeles last week in order to focus on New York , reinforcing a perception that Cruz has a more forward - thinking strategy to rack up delegates before the partyâ€ ™ s possibly contested convention in Cleveland in July .
California has 172 delegates , more than any other state , but coming so late in the primary calendar it traditionally has had no say in deciding the nominee .
Cruz hailed his hosts â€ “ hundreds of cheering fans in the Hotel Irvine â€ “ as kingmakers .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to say something that has not been said in 50 years : California is going to decide the nomination.â€ �
He appealed to the crowd to join a volunteer army more than 265,000-strong , working their phones from home to lobby friends and neighbours .
â€œThe polls show that with me as nominee we beat Hillary Clinton.â€ �
Most polls suggest Cruz would in fact lose to the Democrat but several crowd members said he was still the best bet .
â€œTrump â€
“ heâ€
™ s too radical .
I donâ€
™ t think
heâ€
™ s electable .
If I did , Iâ€ ™
d vote for him , â€ � said Gary Howard , 71 , who used to work in the grocery business .
His wife Judy , 70 , said Cruzâ€ ™ s
unpopularity with Senate colleagues gave her pause but that she believed he will secure the border .
â€œItâ€ ™ s too loose .
Weâ€ ™ ll have more terrorists.â€ �"
2016-04-11,"A future president Trump or Cruz could be defied by his own intelligence chief , after CIA director John Brennan said on Sunday he would not allow members of his agency to carry out torture techniques such as waterboarding .
â€œI will not agree to carry out some of these tactics and techniques Iâ€ ™ ve heard bandied about because this institution needs to endure , â€ �
Brennan told NBC News .
Donald Trump and Ted Cruz , the leading two Republican candidates in a field of three , have suggested they would use waterboarding and other controversial â€œenhanced interrogation techniquesâ€ � against terror suspects .
Cruz has said he does not consider waterboarding to be torture , and would â€œuse whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safeâ€ � .
In the aftermath of the Brussels bombings last month , Trump told NBC : â€œIf they could expand the laws , I would do a lot more than waterboarding .
You have to get the information from people.â€ �
The third remaining candidate , John Kasich , has equivocated on the issue .
Other Republicans who have now dropped out of the race endorsed or refused to rule out the use of torture .
The two Democratic candidates for president , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders , have condemned the use of torture .
In his NBC News interview on Sunday , Brennan was asked specifically about waterboarding .
â€œAbsolutely , â€ � he said .
â€œI would not agree to having any CIA officer carrying out waterboarding again.â€ �
In January 2009 , one of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s first acts as president was to issue an executive order banning the use of enhanced interrogation techniques , which also included , among other methods , rectal feeding and hydration , sleep deprivation and sexual humiliation .
Such techniques were allowed under the Bush administration after the terror attacks of 11 September 2001 .
Brennan took charge of the CIA in 2013 .
In December 2014 , a Senate intelligence committee report issued a damning indictment of the use of such practices by the agency .
In the aftermath of the release of the torture report , Brennan defended the agency , saying : â€œOur reviews indicate that the detention and interrogation program produced useful intelligence that helped the United States thwart attack plans , capture terrorists and save lives.â€ �
He added , however , that it was not certain enhanced interrogation techniques , or EITs , produced better results than more humane methods .
â€œThe cause - and - effect relationship between the use of EITs and useful information subsequently provided by the detainee is , in my view , unknowable , â€ � he said .
In June 2015 , a torture ban was passed into law in the Senate â€ “ against the opposition of 21 Republicans .
Waterboarding has assumed a representative status in the discussion of torture whether by proponents , like Trump and Cruz , or opponents .
The late journalist Christopher Hitchens , for example , had himself subjected to the practice for a Vanity Fair article .
Famously , he wrote : â€œIf waterboarding does not constitute torture , then there is no such thing as torture.â€ �"
2016-04-11,"As the presidential candidates descend on New York for next weekâ€ ™ s primaries , the race to be accepted by the notoriously grouchy and pugnacious denizens of the Empire State is heating up .
Bernie Sanders has been accused of planning to campaign â€œlike a Brooklyniteâ€ � , Hillary Clinton kept on swiping that subway card until it finally worked ( possibly a metaphor for her political career ) , Donald Trump hammered Ted Cruz for the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s attack on â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � , and John Kasich messed up eating pizza , going at it with a knife and fork like a European nobleman ( although he made up for it later by wolfing down an enormous meal in a deli ) .
Just in case you ever want to visit the Big Apple yourself , the Guardian has put together this handy guide to the real New York values you need to understand if youâ€ ™ re going to survive in Gotham City :
Civic pride
Since 1976 , any New York resident able to provide the correct answers to three questions about the cityâ€ ™ s rich history gets to borrow Woody Allen for the day .
Have lunch with him , sit him in your passenger seat so you can take the carpool lane , use him as a coat rack , whatever you want .
He loves it .
The whole thing was his idea in the first place .
Endurance
If youâ€ ™ re going to make it in New York , you need to be tenacious .
How else to survive in a city where you wake up to Gershwinâ€ ™ s Rhapsody in Blue blaring every morning at 5 am , and fall asleep each night to the sound of roving street gangs serenading their girlfriends and mocking Officer Krupke in song ?
Equality
While an outside observer might believe that the city is harshly divided along socio - economic lines , all New Yorkers are united in agreement that no one cares what some dipshit nerd from the middle of nowhere thinks .
Discretion Real New Yorkers understand the importance of minding oneâ€ ™ s own business and how to keep a secret .
In other words , what happens in Tony Danzaâ€ ™ s secret grotto beneath Grand Central Station stays there .
Compromise
For thousands of years , New Yorkers and pigeons have abided by a fragile accord in which both groups cull the population of the other in order to maintain balance .
It has been humansâ€ ™ turn to cull pigeons for the last 399 years , but in January 2017 the tables turn .
Order Manhattan is known for its distinctive grid layout , which makes the city easy to traverse , but few know that when viewed from above the streets take the form of an enormous Sudoku board , an attempt by early city planners to distract God from what they were really getting up to .
Being â€˜in - the - knowâ€ ™
There are a few good spots to sample a tasty , traditional New York chocolate egg cream , but the best and most authentic source is the weird pool mysteriously bubbling up out of the basement of the Gracie Mansion .
Creativity
All you have to do in order to make it as a professional actor or musician in the city that never sleeps is convince Lena Dunham to daub your forehead with water from the Hudson river , and go back in time and convince your parents to enter an extremely high - paying profession ."
2016-04-12,"Ted Cruz may never have stood much of a chance against Donald Trump in next weekâ€ ™ s Republican primary , but his derisive comment about his opponentâ€ ™ s
â€œNew York valuesâ€ �
â€ “ first made in January with an eye on voters in Iowa and New Hampshire â€ “ may have helped his rival seal the deal .
Trump currently stands at 55 % in the polls in New York , according to Real Clear Politicsâ€ ™ polling average , with Cruz on 18 % and Ohio governor John Kasich ahead of him on 20 % .
But the conservative Texas senator does have some supporters prepared to come out and back him in the Empire State .
Midway down
Long Island on Monday , fans turned out to see his wife , Heidi Cruz , and after months of Trump shelling Cruz with â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � insults , they were returning fire .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s like a five - year - old , â€ � said Jeanie Middleton of Trump .
â€œHe throws a tantrum if he doesnâ€ ™ t get his way.â€ �
Husband Bob chimed in : â€œPeople are angry with the government so now you have two anti - establishment candidates .
[ Democrat ] Bernie [ Sanders ] says the system is rigged and Cruz is saying that , too , but Bernie wants to increase government and Ted Cruz wants to reduce it.â€ �
Trump , he said emphatically , is not the answer .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s all over the place .
He changes his mind every five minutes .
Ted Cruz is the closest thing weâ€ ™ ve got to a comprehensive conservative.â€ � New Yorkâ€ ™ s primary system is complicated .
If a candidate gets more than 50 % in a given New York district on Tuesday , he picks up all three delegates there .
If not , the district is divided two - to - one with the runner - up .
In all , 95 delegates are up for grabs .
Trump currently has 743 and Cruz 545 , with 1,237 needed to win .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s efforts to win support in the state have been falling flat .
His criticism of Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œNew York valuesâ€ � backfired when his rival responded by raising the issue of 9/11 ; a campaign stop in the south Bronx misfired when more hecklers than supporters showed up .
Cruz headed to California this week , looking ahead to one of the next big contests , where polls suggest he stands a better chance of success .
So it was his wife who came to canvas pockets of support in the blue - collar towns of mid - Long Island , and try to undo some of the damage he had done .
( There are also other pockets , campaign officials say , upstate near Binghamton and Buffalo , and areas with a concentration of evangelicals . )
â€œI need to tell you how much I love New York , â€ �
the would - be first lady said .
â€œI wanted to move here from six years old because this is where great things happen .
You are survivors , you are leaders .
New Yorkers make things happen.â€ � Her first job was in the city , she said ; it was the place where she had first paid rent and taxes .
Cruzâ€ ™ s
Long Island supporters appeared to be divided into three camps : businesspeople who support reducing an onerous tax burden on employers ; constitutional or Tea Party conservatives ; and evangelicals motivated by religious and right - to - life issues .
â€œIn a predominantly Democratic state , conservatives are quiet about who they are , â€ � said Diane Manfredi .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re quiet because we get slammed by our governor , by the mayor .
[ New York governor Andrew ]
Cuomo said conservatives arenâ€ ™ t welcome .
So theyâ€ ™ re quiet until they get to the ballot box.â€ � Her husband Neil , a financier , was pragmatic about Cruzâ€
™ s chances .
â€œNew York is Trumpâ€
™ s home state
so heâ€
™ s supposed to win , but if Cruz has a good showing itâ€ ™ s going to help him.â€ �
Lutheran pastor George Kirkup , attending with his wife Colleen and their four children , said his main concern was religious liberty .
â€œIâ€
™ m not convinced that Donald Trump really cares about unborn babies
but I know that Cruz does , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about constitutional rights .
Weâ€ ™ re not saying we want a theocracy
but we believe religious liberty is embedded in the constitution , including for babies.â€
�
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a faith - based man , â€ � said Wayne Ferguson , 23 , a trainee minister .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve lost a lot of religious freedom under Obama .
If I deny gay marriage , I could get prosecuted .
Thatâ€ ™ s bad for religious freedom.â€ �
Yvonne Rivera and her friend Diane , who did not want to give her surname , said they were concerned about education .
â€œHe understands that the common core curriculum in public schools is basically a national takeover of the rights of teachers , schools and states to have any say in testing , â€ � said Rivera .
â€œTeachers feel very oppressed by the system , and the amount of data collection involved in common core is an invasion of privacy.â€ �
But for many supporters , at least in Long Island , Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s candidacy is a matter of economic expediency .
â€œLong Island is only 100 miles , but we are 117 municipalities and 987 separate taxing districts .
So thereâ€ ™ s a lot of duplication .
Itâ€ ™ s hard to take a risk here , â€ � says building contractor David Zere , one of the organisers of the event .
Corporate and payroll taxes in the New York state are so high , he said , that his children would have to look out of state for work .
â€œThe unions are too powerful .
Weâ€ ™ re not competitive globally .
We have to get back to conservative values and rugged individualism.â€ �
The US was â€œin the midst of a grassroots movement of very angry taxpayersâ€ � , Zere said .
â€œThe Tea Party helped get conservative candidates elected , but they never came through .
They didnâ€ ™ t address the immigration problem , and spending kept rising .
â€œSo now people are just â€˜Trump !
Trump !
Trump!â€ ™ Theyâ€ ™ re pissed , but they donâ€

2016-04-12,"Donald Trump has cried foul and alleged that he was the victim of â€œa crooked dealâ€ � after the Republican frontrunner lost all 34 of Coloradoâ€
™ s delegates to Ted Cruz over the weekend .
In a campaign rally in Albany , New York , on Monday as well as a series of tweets and an interview with Fox News
, Trump repeatedly claimed that the process in Colorado was corrupt .
â€œWe found out in Colorado this is not a democracy like weâ€ ™ re supposed to have , â€ �
he complained to a crowd of more than 10,000 in Albany , labelling the Republican primary process â€œa rigged , disgusting , dirty systemâ€ � .
Trump had previously made this argument in a series of tweets on Sunday night , alleging â€œthe people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians .
Biggest story in politics .
This will not be allowed!â€ �
Trump also claimed the Cruz campaign bribed voters , tweeting : â€œI win a state in votes and then get non - representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign .
Bad system!â€ �
This echoed the accusation of Trumpâ€ ™ s new convention manager , Paul Manafort , who accused Cruz of engaging in â€œGestapo tacticsâ€ � in an interview on Sunday .
Trump is campaigning heavily in the state of New York in hopes of sweeping all 95 of his home stateâ€ ™ s delegates .
To do so , Trump needs to get over 50 % of the vote statewide and each of the stateâ€ ™ s 27 congressional districts .
Currently , the real estate mogul is polling well over 50 % in the state and has the support of much of its Republican infrastructure .
However , he faces fierce competition both from Cruz and John Kasich .
In a televised town hall rally on Monday , Kasich insisted â€œweâ€ ™ re doing pretty well in New Yorkâ€ � and struck a comparatively moderate note by condemning a law recently passed in Mississippi that allowed business owners to discriminate against gay couples if their existence conflicts with â€œsincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictionsâ€ � .
Cruz , who has been trying to appeal to Orthodox Jews in New York , was out of the state on Monday .
Instead , the Texas senator , who appeared at the spring meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas on Saturday , made a quick campaign trip to California to announce a number of endorsements there .
Cruz will return to New York later in the week for campaign events as well as an appearance on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon .
Democrats are also going back and forth in New York .
Hillary Clinton , who has a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders in the state , continued to attack her rival on gun control while Sanders criticised the former secretary of state yet again for her ties to Wall Street .
The accusations from Trump over the Colorado result are rooted in it being one of the few states not to hold any type of presidential preference vote where voters can register their opinion in the Republican primary race .
This was a change made in August 2015 in an attempt to give grassroots Republicans increased power .
Instead , delegates are elected in a system similar to the Iowa caucuses , where Republicans in each precinct elect representatives to county conventions .
Each county convention then elects representatives to district and state conventions , where delegates to the Republican national convention ( RNC ) are chosen .
This system culminated in Colorado on Sunday when roughly 3,900 Republicans meeting in a hockey arena in Colorado Springs elected 13 delegates pledged to Cruz for the RNC in Cleveland .
Previously , Cruz had won a total of 21 delegates in the seven individual congressional district conventions held in the state .
Observers have put Cruzâ€ ™ s success down to superior organisation among a very conservative electorate .
The Texas senator had been organising in Colorado for almost a year .
In contrast , Trumpâ€ ™ s state director , Patrick Davis , was just hired last week and the campaign had practically no contact with grassroots activists .
Trump staffers openly admitted to reporters that they had no expectation of winning a single delegate .
These issues were further aggravated by the campaign printing out flawed sample ballots that directed Trump supporters to vote for the wrong candidates to be delegates to the RNC .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
tirade prompted a quick response on Twitter from Cory Gardner , the stateâ€ ™ s Republican senator .
Gardner went on the attack , deriding Trump both for his lack of effort and his â€œtemper tantrumâ€ � Gardner , who previously supported Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s presidential bid , has yet to endorse any of the remaining three candidates .
Even the RNC chair , Reince Priebus , who has been loth to alienate the mercurial Trump , weighed in meekly .
The contretemps comes less than a week before Wyoming holds its state convention .
Wyoming , like Colorado , did not hold any sort of presidential preference vote .
Fourteen of the stateâ€ ™ s 29 delegates to the RNC will be chosen there and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin is expected to appear in Wyoming on Trumpâ€ ™ s behalf ."
2016-04-13,"On the campaign trail , Ted Cruz portrays himself as a â€œconstitutional conservativeâ€ � who is committed to preserving Americansâ€ ™ ( largely unthreatened ) right to religious freedom and access to the guns of their choosing .
He is , he tells his audiences , interested in limiting the reach of the federal government into their lives , and often explicitly promises to limit the power of the federal government in various ways .
But in 2007 , when he was solicitor general of the state of Texas , Cruz took a slightly more expansive view of the appropriate role of the federal government , when he participated in a federal court case in an effort to maintain Texasâ€ ™ s ban on the sale of sex toys .
In that case , highlighted by Mother Jones , two sex toy companies sued to render moot the stateâ€ ™ s ban on the sale of so - called â€œmarital aidsâ€
�
â€ “ as they are often called in conservative circles .
The stateâ€ ™ s counterarguments , penned in part by the office run by Cruz , were that the use of sex toys was akin to â€œhiring a willing prostitute or engaging in consensual bigamyâ€ � , and there is a state interest in â€œdiscouraging prurient interests in autonomous sex and the pursuit of sexual gratification unrelated to procreationâ€ � .
The state â€ “ and Cruz â€ “ further argued that the sale of sex toys in the state of Texas was not an interference with the right to privacy for oneâ€ ™ s sexual activity as established by the US supreme court in Lawrence v Texas , which threw out state bans on consensual same - sex acts of physical intimacy .
The US supreme court found that there was no compelling state interest in interfering in the sexual lives of consenting adults , citing the privacy protections of the 14th amendment of the US constitution .
But that â€œright to privacyâ€ � , as understood by most Americans , is actually not explicitly enshrined in either the constitution or the bill of rights : itâ€ ™ s built upon multiple interpretations of the amendment by the supreme court , which has ruled that the right to privacy is inferred .
When conservatives like Cruz pontificate about â€œactivist legal scholarsâ€ � or overly broad interpretations of the constitution , theyâ€ ™ re quite often referring to the right to privacy , which has allowed the legalization of abortion , birth control , same - sex relationships and same - sex marriage .
The extremely detailed brief filed by Texas officials included a number of legalistic gems that ought to haunt Cruz , but the crux of the argument was this : There is no substantive - due - process right to stimulate oneâ€ ™ s genitals for non - medical purposes unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship .
In other words , Cruz and the state argued that masturbation ( and/or sex for pleasure alone ) is not covered by the right to privacy and thus is subject to state regulation .
But Cruz and his colleagues did not happen upon that argument on their own : as Guardian US columnist Scott Lemieux once noted , now - deceased Justice Antonin Scalia made a similar argument - cum - warning in his dissent to the 2003 Lawrence case [ emphasis
Lemieuxâ€ ™ s ] :
State laws against bigamy , same - sex marriage , adult incest , prostitution , masturbation , adultery , fornication , bestiality , and obscenity are likewise sustainable only in light of Bowersâ€ ™ validation of laws based on moral choices .
Every single one of these laws is called into question by todayâ€ ™ s decision ; the Court makes no effort to cabin the scope of its decision to exclude them from its holding .
On Wednesday , Lemieux said , â€œScalia warned in his Lawrence dissent that it could lead to a right to stimulate oneâ€ ™ s genitals .
Fortunately , Ted Cruz [ was ] there to bravely fight this slippery slope.â€ �
Cruz and colleagues also argued that there was no historical basis for a right to private self - satisfaction : But even assuming that Appellants had articulated a right sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the Glucksberg test [ establishing a right as fundamental ] , they could not show that the right to promote dildos , vibrators , and other obscene devices â€ “ or , indeed , even to use those devices in private â€ “ is â€˜deeply rooted in this Nationâ€ ™ s history and tradition , and implicit in the concept of ordered libertyâ€ ™ .
Though museum historians would likely disagree that the use of devices for self - stimulation is a newfangled development in human history , Ben Shattuckâ€ ™ s research into colonial dildo use on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket suggests that , in fact , â€œobscene devicesâ€ � were indeed â€œdeeply rooted in the Nationâ€ ™ s history and traditionâ€ � and , not until more recently , subject to state scrutiny ( barring , perhaps , the Salem witch trials ) .
But the heart of the problem for a small - government conservative would probably come in Cruzâ€ ™ s argument that there is a substantive state interest in regulating some sex acts : â€œmoralityâ€ � .
The morality - based interests behind the statuteâ€ ™ s prohibition on commerce in obscene devices include discouraging prurient interests in autonomous sex and the pursuit of sexual gratification unrelated to procreation â€ ¦
In other words , Cruz argued that the state had a moral interest in discouraging masturbation and non - procreative orgasms â€ “ a fundamental intrusion in the sex lives of a tremendous proportion of Americans .
To shore up the argument that the state has a fundamental interest in discouraging masturbation and orgasms achieved with no procreative intent through the use of police action , the top lawyers in the state compared those sex acts to bigamy and engaging prostitutes : Finally , it is undoubtedly true that some individuals and couples â€ “ perhaps even some married couples â€ “ believe that hiring a willing prostitute or engaging in consensual bigamy would enhance their sexual experiences .
The fifth circuit court of appeals , perhaps unsurprisingly , ruled in favor of the randy masses in 2008 .
It said , The right the Court recognized [ in Lawrence v Texas ] was not simply a right to engage in the sexual act itself , but instead a right to be free from governmental intrusion regarding â€˜the most private human contact , sexual behaviorâ€ ™ .
And in the course of what can only be described as a legal evisceration of the stateâ€ ™ s case against selling access to mechanically assisted orgasms , it also asserted : An individual who wants to legally use a safe sexual device during private intimate moments alone or with another is unable to legally purchase a device in Texas , which heavily burdens a constitutional right .
But while the fifth circuit decreed that any barriers to Americansâ€ ™ access to sex toys infringed upon their rights to utilize them , that court ruled in 2015 that Texasâ€ ™ s
anti - abortion â€œTrapâ€ � laws , which would limit womenâ€ ™ s access to legal abortion services by limiting the number of clinics in Texas that could offer such services , did not impose enough of a burden to womenâ€ ™ s access to abortion to justify overturning those laws .
The US supreme court heard arguments in that case in March and is expected to rule later this year .
Cruz , unsurprisingly , also supports the Texas restrictions on abortion ."
2016-04-13,"Whether itâ€ ™ s conservatives deriding the â€œnanny stateâ€ � , former president Bill Clinton declaring the era of â€œbig governmentâ€ � to be over , or Ted Cruz attacking â€œNew York valuesâ€ � , big government seems to be perpetually under attack .
But what if the fight over â€œbig governmentâ€ � simply comes down to how much you value a human life ?
That is the implication of a groundbreaking study from the Health Inequality Project on the impacts of inequality in the United States .
The studyâ€ ™ s authors reviewed years of tax earnings and social security death records , and came to two notable conclusions .
First , the bad news , considering our widening income gap : the rich live longer than the poor .
In the early 1980s , the top 10 % of earners lived 2.8 years longer than the bottom 10 % .
By the 1990s , according to the US Department of Health and Human Services , that gap had grown to 4.5 years .
This latest study found that the richest American men â€ “ the top 1 % â€ “ live 15 years longer than the men in the bottom 1 % , while for women the divide is a decade .
In other words , extreme income inequality doesnâ€ ™ t just hamper economic growth , lead to wealth being hoarded rather than circulated healthily through the economy , and promote a banking sector devoted to gambling instead of job creation .
Extreme inequality also kills people .
Now , the good news : those big - government policies that Republicans â€ “ and even some Democrats â€ “ love to condemn might actually save lives .
The same study found that the gap in lifespan varied not only based on income , but also location .
Poor Americans in liberal enclaves such as New York City and San Francisco lived longer than those in cities such as Dallas and Detroit , a surprising statistic which the studyâ€ ™ s authors chalk up to social spending and public health policies in those areas .
New York City , for example , spends heavily on healthcare assistance and anti - poverty programs .
The budget of the department of social services is second only to city spending on education , and the city makes significant investments in medical assistance .
But it is government policies that promote healthy habits which make the biggest difference , according to the studyâ€ ™ s authors .
The cities where the poor live longer also promote walking and have strong systems of public transit , instead of prioritizing cars over pedestrians and cyclists .
They also make it harder for international corporations to peddle death - dealing products .
A pack of cigarettes costs more in New York City â€ “ more than $ 12 â€ “ than in any other US city save Chicago , thanks to a combination of state and local taxes .
New York City also banned trans fats , which have been linked to heart disease , and forces chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus so that diners are informed about what they are eating .
These are the â€œNew York
valuesâ€
� that Cruz , a possible Republican presidential nominee , famously attacked at a debate in the fall
â€ “
and they help people live longer .
Imagine the benefits if all of America were to adopt the same philosophy , or pursue big , ambitious ideas such as guaranteeing all Americans a subsistence - level income .
Conservatives want us to believe that walkable neighborhoods are a hippie dream , and public transit is a waste of funds .
They may decry outright tax evasion , but they still balk at the idea that the wealthiest few should pay back society for helping them get rich , and that money should go to assistance for the poorest among us .
They insist that companies should have the liberty to put profits over healthy food and , until crushed by the weight of public opinion , long mounted campaigns arguing diners should have the right to fill a tight space with second - hand smoke if they so choose .
But there is nothing more American than insisting that someoneâ€ ™ s economic class should not dictate whether they live or die .
Liberal policies that promote public health donâ€
™ t undermine our national character ; they enhance our freedom to live our lives to the fullest .
Republicans have become so addicted to defending privilege and power that they have forgotten about life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
The real debate is not over the size of government .
It is whether you think right - wing economic principles matter more than real human beings .
If big government means valuing lives , then sign me up ."
2016-04-16,"Senator Ted Cruz won all 14 delegates at stake on Saturday in Wyoming , after his closest rival for the Republican presidential nomination , Donald Trump , made little effort to win the rural state .
Cruz is trying to prevent Trump from obtaining the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination at the July convention in Cleveland .
By continuing to rack up small wins , Cruz is gaining ground on the real estate billionaire , who has failed to shift his focus to the local - level campaigning necessary to win delegates .
Trump has been critical of the process , again on Saturday calling it â€œriggedâ€ � while speaking at a rally in Syracuse , New York , ahead of the primary there on Tuesday .
He has repeatedly complained about Colorado , which awarded all 34 of its delegates to Cruz despite not holding a popular vote .
Trump said his supporters are becoming increasingly angry with states such as Wyoming and Colorado .
His campaign , though , made a conscious decision not to commit resources to Wyoming , according to Alan Cobb , a senior adviser .
Trump picked up only one delegate in last monthâ€ ™ s county conventions while Cruz scored nine ; 475 party activists gathered on Saturday to make the statewide selections .
Cruz spoke at the convention , capping a months - long effort to organize support in the state .
Trump had planned to send the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin but she canceled at the last minute .
In the largest coal - producing state , Cruz spoke of a Democratic â€œattackâ€ � on fossil fuels and said President Obama had tried to put the coal industry out of business through government regulations targeting air pollution .
â€œAmerica is the Saudi Arabia of coal , and we are going to develop our industry , â€ � Cruz said .
The Obama administration recently imposed a moratorium on new coal leases .
Wyoming and other states have mounted legal challenges to US Environmental Protection Agency regulations tightening emission limits on coal - fired power plants .
â€œHillary Clinton promises that if sheâ€ ™ s elected , sheâ€ ™ s going to finish the task and bankrupt anyone associated with coal , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œI give you my word right now , we are going to lift the federal regulators back , we are going to end the war on coal.â€ �
Announcing the restrictions in 2014 , Obama said carbon emission cause health problems and contribute to global warming .
â€œFor the sake of all our kids , weâ€ ™ ve got to do more to reduce it , â€ � he said .
Cruz , however , in an interview with the Associated Press on Saturday after his speech , said he was â€œnot
remotelyâ€ � concerned that rolling back federal restrictions on coal could contribute to an increase global warming .
â€œThe war on coal is driven by an ideological extremism on the part of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and todayâ€ ™ s modern Democratic Party , â€ �
he said .
Cruz also drew applause for promising to protect gun rights and turn federal lands in the west over to the states .
He told the crowd he was â€œpretty sure , here in Wyoming , yâ€ ™ all define gun control the same way we do in Texas â€
“ and that is hitting what youâ€ ™ re aiming
atâ€ � .
Lynne Cheney , the wife of former vice - president Dick Cheney , introduced Cruz .
Their daughter , Liz Cheney , is one of a crowded field of candidates running for the stateâ€ ™ s lone seat in the US House .
â€œHe is part of a young generation of rising leaders and rising constitutional conservatives who are pointing our country back to the fundamental principles on which our country is based , â€ � Lynne Cheney said of Cruz .
â€œHe is also a westerner , and he is attuned to our values.â€ �
In Syracuse , New York , Trump referred to Colorado when he said : â€œTheyâ€ ™ re going nuts out there ; theyâ€ ™ re angry .
The bosses took away their vote , and I wasnâ€ ™ t going to send big teams of people three , four months ago , have them out there.â€ �
Cobb said : â€œThis process is favorable toward party insider folks .
When you donâ€ ™ t have a vote of the people , it just favors [ Cruz ] .
The very insider , narrow pathways like Wyoming , they just donâ€ ™ t work very well for us .
â€œCampaigns make strategic choices on where to go and where to invest , and just given your process here ,
it just doesnâ€ ™ t lend itself to our kind of campaign and candidate.â€ �
Even so , Cobb said he still saw Trump on track to win the 1,237 delegates required to secure the Republican nomination on the first ballot at the national convention this summer .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got the north - east states , â€ �
he said .
â€œI think weâ€ ™ ll do well in California , Oregon , Washington.â€ �"
2016-04-16,"Time was when the radical left was the force attacking the Enlightenment basis of western civilisation and challenging the mores and landmarks of day - to - day life .
Today , that mantle has passed to the radical right .
The most visible expression of this will be the US Republican partyâ€ ™ s convention in Cleveland this July , riven by hatred between the Donald Trump and Ted Cruz camps as they struggle to win a contest in which no one candidate has won a clear majority in the primaries .
Who can best express the cocktail of nativism , hatred of foreigners in general and immigrants in particular , fetishisation of the absence of government and its handmaiden , the ultra - free market , all wrapped up in profoundly reactionary views of women , religion and punishment , that constitutes the ideology of todayâ€ ™ s US right ?
It will be hand - to - hand political in - fighting , plumbing new depths of viciousness and possible physical violence .
Thus will America be great again .
Neither candidate should be remotely electable in this still great republic and while some of what is being said is commonplace in parts of the deep south , derelict industrial areas , rundown suburbs , rightwing thinktanks and billionaire political backers and media outriders , it is far from the mainstream , where common decencies still rule .
But this is not an argument unique to what seems an increasingly foreign country across the Atlantic : the same very rightwing forces are at work in Britain .
A similar ideological cocktail animates the Leave EU campaign in the struggle against mainstream liberal Britain .
Trump and Cruz have their counterparts in Farageâ€ ™ s splenetic anti - immigrant nativism , Johnsonâ€ ™ s de haut en bas populism , Redwoodâ€ ™ s intellectual anti - statism etc .
Just as many Americans fear a President Cruz or Trump decisively re - engineering their country and its leadership of the west , so there is a growing apprehension that similar rightwing forces are about to re - engineer Britain and its place in the world for the worse .
The scale of the Anglo - Saxon ultra - rightâ€ ™ s ambition â€ “ and its distance from the interests of real people , real lives , real business , real science and real international interdependencies â€ “ is disturbing .
Getting here has been a 30-year journey .
You may disagree with mainstream Conservatism , but it has a respectable pedigree .
Democracies should have parties of the right that are distrustful of government , pro - enterprise , sceptical of the value of organised labour , anxious to minimise taxation , wary of social experimentation and ethnic diversity .
A lot of people think that way and their views must be represented .
But for the radical right in the US , that portfolio of views is part of the middle - of - the - road establishment : devotees can even , horror of horrors , cut deals with Democrats in Congress .
Reaganite championing of the market and small government has morphed into a libertarianism that is against government in principle .
Thus Cruz wants to abolish the Departments of Education , Energy and Housing along with the Inland Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency .
Progressive taxation is anathema .
The dollar should be backed by gold , making the Federal Reserve redundant .
One close adviser to Obama told me last week that the government starts with the assumption that any legislative initiative will be vetoed by Republicans whatever its intrinsic merits .
Acts of government , or what Cruz calls the Washington cartel , are by definition bad .
Meanwhile , both he and Trump rail against immigration , which they elide with terrorism .
Trump wants to round up 11 million illegal immigrants and deport them , along with banning every Muslim from entering the US .
Cruz wants to complete the 700-mile fence along the Mexico border : Trump wants to replace it with a wall .
What feeds all this is the belief that America has fallen from greatness abroad , can not offer rising living standards at home and must guard against a tidal wave of Islamic terrorism .
Americaâ€ ™ s identity is at stake .
But there are different answers to building walls and trying to abolish the state and taxation â€ “ and which have broader appeal .
It is more obvious that a rogue capitalism is the source of Americaâ€ ™ s ills , not the poor old state , for most people even in the US their lifeline and shaper of opportunities .
The idea of checked and balanced democratic government as the expression of the commonweal is the great Enlightenment gift , well expressed in the US constitution , and which mainstream America understands .
In this sense , Cruz and Trump set themselves against the founding fathers of their country and its culture .
Thus it should be no surprise that the self - styled democratic socialist Bernie Sanders is challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination more effectively than even he could have supposed 12 months ago .
He is less a socialist , more an exponent of using smart government actively to serve the common interest , redistribute income and reshape the increasingly dysfunctional institutions of the US economy .
He wonâ€ ™ t win the nomination , but he is pushing Clinton into much more proactive left positions than she would have otherwise have taken .
And she is much more likely to be president than Cruz or Trump .
The right , notwithstanding its amazing financial resources , is in the depths of a deep crisis .
As it becomes a prisoner of its worst instincts taken to their ideological extreme , it becomes unelectable .
In Britain , David Cameronâ€ ™ s travails have come from wrongly believing that the right is in the political and intellectual ascendancy .
The country wonâ€ ™ t let its steel industry disappear to â€œmarket forcesâ€
�
that are so transparently rigged ; does not believe that trusts in Panama can ever be private matters ; will not connive in lowering the living standards of the disabled to drive up those of the upper - middle - class .
The mass of the electorate are not converts to zero government and libertarianism .
How the referendum will go is more uncertain ; a lot will depend on whether Labour and the trade unions can energise their support , and whether business will have the chutzpah to speak out .
On balance , Remain will probably win .
But win or lose , the result will prompt a crisis in British Conservatism analogous to that in US Republicanism .
Europe has been a proxy for a fight between mainstream liberal Tories and the libertarian anti - state outriders for 20 years .
Once the result is known , the battle will be on in earnest , with the mutual name - calling already opening up unbridgeable divisions .
Labour needs Jeremy Corbyn to do the same job as Sanders : move his party to the left but leave a mainstream variant of Clinton with broad appeal to win in 2020 â€ “ and keep on winning .
The 30-year rise of the right is over ."
2016-04-16,"An anti - GOP rally in Denver on Friday that Donald Trump predicted would be a â€œbig protestâ€ � was weak on attendance , with only a couple hundred supporters on hand , though not short on enthusiasm .
Trump has repeatedly claimed he was cheated of delegates since Ted Cruz dominated at the state convention last weekend , winning all 34 of Coloradoâ€ ™
s bound national delegates .
Tweets from the presidential frontrunner sought to whip supporters into a collective demand for change .
The chilly weather and coming rainstorm did little to smother the crowdâ€ ™ s anger , as shouts of â€œLiars!â€ � â€œCorruption!â€ � and â€œUSA !
USA!â€ � rang out during the modestly sized protest .
A failing megaphone made it difficult for the crowd to hear the eventâ€ ™ s guest speakers , but the anger emanating from both the stage and the crowd was undeniable .
â€œI
canâ€ ™ t believe the corruption in the Colorado GOP!â€ � exclaimed Larry Lindsey , a veteran and actor who played Gerald Ford in the 1993 comedy Hot Shots , Part Deux .
Lindsey made headlines this week when he burned his Republican party registration card in a viral video that was tweeted by Trump .
â€œThis caucus system has been manipulated to get the results that the GOP wants and not what the voters want , â€ � he said .
He said that he was supposed to be a delegate , but was turned away at the state convention by an official who said Lindsey was not registered as a Republican .
The rally offered hints of what could come in July if there is a contested Republican convention in Cleveland in which Trump fails to win the nomination .
Trump has repeatedly said that the rules of the Colorado Republican caucus were changed in an effort to deny him delegates .
In August , the Colorado GOP canceled a presidential straw poll that it has had in years past .
But it continued the longstanding system in which caucus voters elect county delegates , who elect state and congressional delegates , who elect national delegates in the state convention , who go on to represent the state at the national convention .
One protester on Friday described it as a â€œweird game of telephoneâ€ � .
â€œThe system is not fundamentally different this year from previous years , â€ � said Daniel Cole , executive director of the Republican Party in El Paso County , where the state convention was held .
Cole said that in the last three presidential elections , â€œwe elected national delegates through the exact same process as we elected them this year .
The only difference is that in 2008 and 2012 we did a nonbinding straw poll , which allowed people to express their opinion on who the nominee should be , but it was without effect of any kind.â€ �
Cole added that he believed the caucus system was convoluted and disenfranchised some voters ; he said he was in favor of a changing to a primary system , but that can only be done by the state legislature .
So he said it was good protesters were showing up at the state capital , but their ire should not be directed at the GOP .
Critics of Trump note that he was not present at the Colorado state convention , did not hire any staffers in the state until days before the convention , and was simply not as engaged and organized as the Cruz campaign .
â€œThe notion that any secret group of politicians colluded behind closed doors against one presidential candidate last August by eliminating the straw poll is completely false , â€ � said Colorado GOP chairman Steve House in a statement released Friday .
â€œThe intention of the executive committee was to preserve grassroots influence on the caucus process and to not bind our national delegation to a straw poll that we felt was nontransparent and lacked integrity .
â€œIt is also critical to note the caucus , county assembly , congressional assembly , and state convention process was open to all Colorado Republicans .
No special status or connection was needed to get involved and influence the process in favor of oneâ€ ™ s preferred candidate .
The results at state convention are a direct reflection of the voices of Colorado Republicans speaking at the March 1 caucus.â€ �
Chris West , of Woodland Park , Colorado , drove nearly 90 miles to attend Fridayâ€ ™ s protest .
â€œWe just want to be like all of the rest of the states and get to vote in our primary , â€ � she said .
â€œWe werenâ€
™ t notified in August when they changed the rules .
Itâ€ ™ s suspicious
that there are millions of Trump supporters in this state , but we have no vote.â€
�
West said she had not voted in the Republican caucus in March .
â€œWe were all excited to vote , and then we saw they changed the rules .
Weâ€ ™ re not allowed to vote â€ “ we have to tell someone how to vote.â€
�
The announcement of Fridayâ€ ™ s protest on the website coloradovotesmatter.com said the intention was to â€œmake a showing of the vast number of Colorado voters who are not represented by the 34 delegates selected at our recent state conventionâ€ � ."
2016-04-19,"New Yorkers know how to party , which is why Sara Caldwell just spent several days building and hand painting a 36-in tall custom Ted Cruz piÃ±ata to send off to a primary party in New York on Tuesday .
The 54-year - old from Santa Clarita , California , runs the Etsy store Mosaic Bones , where she sells her handmade presidential candidate piÃ±atas ( priced from $ 30 ) and papier - mÃ¢chÃ
© decorations .
For the custom piÃ±ata being sent to New York â€ “ so large
she needed to make a special box to ship it
â€ “ Caldwell shaped Cruzâ€ ™ s body out of cardboard and papier
- mÃ¢chÃ
© , then created a Cruz button in Clip Art to go along with his painted blue suit and thick quizzical eyebrows .
â€œIâ€ ™ m so glued to the politics this year ...
no pun intended , â€ � Caldwell said .
Sheâ€
™ s not the only crafter around the country inspired by this yearâ€ ™ s election .
The online marketplace Etsy shows thousands of results for homemade election merchandise .
You can buy Bernie Sanders bow ties , clay pendants shaped like Hillary Clinton , earrings featuring Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s face , embroidered Donald Trump quotes â€ “ even a 3D - printed â€œBirdie Sandersâ€ � sandstone figurine of the sparrow that landed on his lectern .
Caldwell , who teaches film - making at College of the Canyons , has found election merchandise to be a profitable side business , with at least 60 large piÃ±atas and more than 120 smaller decorations sold .
Trump piÃ±atas were her first product , intended to serve as a political statement against Trumpâ€ ™ s stance toward undocumented Mexican immigrants .
Of the piÃ±atas sold , 90 % were of Trump .
â€œMore people want to hit him , â€ �
Caldwell laughed .
Capturing the likeness of each candidate is key .
Her Sanders piÃ±ata â€ “ her second - biggest seller â€ “ includes hand - painted glasses and his trademark wild professor hair made out of humble cotton balls .
â€œWith Bernie , I knew it was cotton balls .
You can pull and tug on it and make it a little crazy , â€ � Caldwell said .
Tobey King , a stay - at - home mom , was a fan of Donald Trump as a celebrity , and once he announced his political intentions , she was thrilled to add him to her series of crocheted candidates .
â€œI thought
heâ€ ™ d be a great doll and that Iâ€ ™
d love to do that hair , â€ � said King , 41 , who sells Trump , Sanders and Cruz dolls at her Etsy store TobeyTimeCrochet from her home in Corpus Christi , Texas .
King is an undecided voter but not a Clinton fan .
Nailing the famous Trump helmet hair took a few attempts .
In the first go , King used strands of individual gold yarn to create it , but she wasnâ€ ™ t satisfied with the texture .
Now sheâ€ ™ s figured out the best method .
â€œI use a little metal brush and brush the fibers out of the yarn and it comes out this nice fuzzy , fluffy thing and I glue it in place , â€ � she explained .
â€œOther crocheters message me all the time about my Donald pattern , â€ �
King said .
She makes a Ted Cruz doll as well , but hasnâ€ ™ t sold one yet .
â€œHe

The most popular Etsy candidate â€ “ unsurprising , given his folksy appeal â€ “ is Sanders , with pages of jewelry , T - shirts and painted artworks dedicated to the Vermont senator turned revolutionary leader .
â€œI was a big fan of Bernie Sanders and figured Iâ€ ™
d make a pendant of that design that he had , â€ � said Chris Kline , from the Los Angeles area , referring to the illustration of Sandersâ€ ™ glasses and hair that was once painted on his headquarters in Iowa and has since become a ubiquitous image in his campaign .
â€œBernieâ€ ™ s got that iconic head with the glasses and the hair ,
itâ€ ™ s kind of perfect , â€ � Kline said .
A laser repairman , Kline uses a fiber laser machine to create Bernie Sanders jewelry , which he sells at his Etsy store Dill Pickle Pendants .
At first , he only sold pendants â€ “ until a customer requested a small pair of earrings .
Now those earrings are his top seller , and 15 % of sales go to the Sanders campaign .
Sandersâ€ ™ popularity has meant that Kline and his wife have turned their jewelry project into a full - fledged business , with more than 800 sales to date .
The couple have day jobs , however , so they are only able to work on the jewelry in the evenings .
â€œWe sit down every night and we make them .
I get home from work every day
and I work on these Bernie pendants , â€ � he said .
While Kline suspects itâ€ ™ s mainly devoted Bernistas buying his merchandise , he says thatâ€ ™ s not always the case .
One woman contacted him after he sent her a pair of Bernie earrings , saying : â€œâ€˜I got these in the mail and I donâ€
™ t know who they came from and Iâ€ ™ m not really a Bernie supporter , but thank you , â€ ™ â€ � recalled Kline , who suspects the earrings were used as a prank â€ “ or to goad her into voting for Sanders .
But he doesnâ€ ™ t care about the politics of the customer .
â€œI
just get the order and ship it , â€ � he said ."
2016-04-20,"Two weeks is an eternity in politics .
On April 5 , Senator Ted Cruz won a decisive victory over GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in Wisconsin .
Cruzâ€ ™ s victory was supposed to mark the beginning of the end for Trump .
The pundits and the anti - Trump crowd in the Republican party crowed about how his campaign was finally on the verge of the meltdown they always insisted would transpire .
Back then , Cruz declared : â€œTonight is a turning point .
It is a rallying cry.â€ �
Well , on a spring night in New York , that turning point became a U - turn .
Trumpâ€ ™ s victory cuts across every demographic .
He won right across the state .
With young and old .
And despite all the talk about his problems with female voters , he won decisively with both men and women .
All of the work Cruz had done to narrow the delegate gap over the last two weeks , picking them off one at a time , is likely to be completely undone by tonightâ€ ™ s victory .
Worse for him and his supporters , the calendar is about to get even more daunting .
Next week , voters will go to the polls in Connecticut , Pennsylvania , Delaware , and Maryland .
All states where Donald Trump leads in the polls .
The trajectory of this race is now back to where it was before Wisconsin .
Donald Trump is in the driverâ€ ™ s seat .
He is the only candidate capable of securing the 1,237 delegates needed before the Republican national convention in Cleveland and he is the clear favorite to win the nomination .
This does not mean that Trump is unstoppable .
Itâ€ ™ s still possible that the formidable anti - Trump forces within the party might succeed â€ “ but it wonâ€ ™ t be at the ballot box .
Because what tonightâ€ ™ s results make clear is that when Republican voters are asked to go to the polls to select the partyâ€ ™ s nominee , Trump usually wins .
The Cruz campaign has banked on low - turnout caucuses and winning delegates in states that didnâ€ ™ t bother to have a presidential preference vote at all .
This presents a stark contrast in how the two men are perceived as we head towards the finish line .
Donald Trump is the candidate of Republican primary voters , while Ted Cruz â€ “ incredibly , given his past â€ “ is the candidate of party insiders .
If Donald Trump fails to secure the nomination in Cleveland , it will not be because it was â€œstolenâ€ � from him as Trump supporters are already claiming .
If Cruz â€ “ or some other candidate â€ “ succeeds on a second , third or fourth ballot , that will be completely with the rules .
It wonâ€ ™ t be cheating , but it also wonâ€ ™ t be consistent , even in the vaguest sense , with what Republican primary voters actually want .
I am not a Trump supporter .
I didnâ€ ™ t vote for him when my state ( Virginia ) voted , and I am not sure that I can vote for him in November if he is the nominee .
I do , however , believe strongly that political parties are made up of people , and at the end of the day the Republican party should be a reflection of what those people actually want .
Donald Trump will go to Cleveland having won â€ “ by far â€ “ the most votes , the most primaries , and the most delegates .
What would it say about the Republican party if at that point , at the end of an almost year - and - a - half - long process , it simply said â€œthanks , but no thanksâ€ � to the will of its own voters ?
New York , like so many of the nominating contests in this cycle , might not be want party insiders want , but it does express the desires of grassroots Republicans .
Right now all roads lead to a Trump nomination .
The only question is whether the establishment can find a last minute detour ."
2016-04-20,"As Barack Obama arrives in Britain on Thursday , the choice facing Americans about his White House successor has just got a bit clearer .
It isnâ€ ™ t too often that the New York primary shapes a US presidential race , but this year it may have put both the Republican and the Democratic frontrunners back on track to win their respective nominations in the summer .
After his defeat at the hands of Ted Cruz in Wisconsin at the start of this month , Donald Trump suddenly looked as if his drive to the nomination , which was beginning to appear irresistible in March , was faltering .
There was serious talk of the party trying to unify around the ultra - conservative Mr Cruz in an attempt to wrest the prize from
Mr Trumpâ€ ™ s hands at the convention .
But Mr Trumpâ€ ™ s money , organisation and blue - collar appeal in a state where he has made so much of his fame and fortune proved stronger .
An establishment rally to deprive the populist interloper of his victory is still a possibility , but it is now a lot harder to pull off and the consequences could be more hazardous .
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s victory in the Democratic contest may once have seemed predictable .
But a succession of wins for the socialist Bernie Sanders had spurred talk of a massive upset .
The New York primary had become a must - win for Mrs Clinton , who might have struggled to keep a Sanders bandwagon in check if she had lost .
The projected 16-point margin of her victory makes the remarkable Sanders campaign a long shot once again .
Both races will continue , and continue to be fierce .
But the losers from New York face big decisions .
Does the Republican party have the nerve , organisation and alternative candidate to stop Mr Trump ?
And should the Democrats begin to unite around Mrs Clinton and her programme ?
Neither of these things is easy , and there are still important primaries in play .
But a Trump v Clinton contest now looks a bit more probable than before ."
2016-04-20,"After winning over 60 % of the New York Republican primary vote , Donald Trump tweeted of rival Ted Cruz : â€œNow all he can do is be a spoiler , never a nice thing to do .
I will beat Hillary!â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s
New York blowout
But Cruz predicted that the race would culminate in a standoff of extreme rarity in modern presidential politics .
â€œWe are headed to a contested convention , â€ �
he said .
Hello , Cleveland !
Cruz downplays Trump win
The Trump campaign held a considerably rosier view .
An internal memo predicted Trump would rack up 1,400 delegates by July .
The prediction appeared to involve some extremely creative math .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
ambitious math
The Republican Party has a system where you can buy the delegates if you want .
And you can do anything you want with a delegate , except give them cash .
I can play the game better
â€
”
I can fly them on a 757 to Mar - a - Lago , I can fly them to California where I own a place
thatâ€ ™ s unbelievable , on the Pacific Ocean .
But itâ€ ™ s a bad system .
Youâ€ ™ re buying the election .
Itâ€ ™ s really wrong , and Iâ€ ™ m looking into it , legally .
â€ “ Donald J Trump , in a New York Times interview A Bernie Sanders fundraising email insisted â€œwe still have a path to the nomination
, â€ � despite Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s 16-point New York victory .
The campaign did not share its math .
Sanders : we still have a path
Tonight , the race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch and victory is in sight .
â€ “ Hillary Clinton , at her Manhattan victory party on Tuesday Clinton scores decisive victory"
2016-04-20,"Donald Trump swept to victory in his home state of New York on Tuesday , reviving his hopes of winning the Republican party nomination outright .
The billionaire businessman was always expected to thrive in his home state and there was never much doubt that he would defeat Ted Cruz , the Texas senator whose brand of conservatism went down badly here , and Ohio governor John Kasich , who struggled to make an impact .
But after victory was called for Trump by the Associated Press just moments after polls closed , it became clear that he would claim most of the 95 Republican delegates up for grabs in New York , strengthening his assertion that he is the only candidate with a realistic shot at the 1,237 needed to clinch the GOP nomination .
With over 95 % of the vote counted , Trump was on 60 % , with Kasich on 25.2 % and Cruz trailing with just 14.8 % .
â€œItâ€ ™ s just incredible , â€ �
Trump told a crowd at Trump Tower in Manhattan .
â€œI guess weâ€ ™ re close to 70 % , and weâ€ ™ re gon na end at a very high level , and get a lot more delegates than anybody projected , even in their wildest imagination.â€ �
Trump led in four of the five boroughs of New York City â€ “ but on his home turf of Manhattan , Kasich was slightly ahead , 45%-43 % , after almost 100 % of the vote had been counted .
In Queens , where the billionaire grew up , he was firmly ahead with 67 % .
Trump had 64 % of the vote in Kings County , which covers Brooklyn , and in Richmond County ( Staten Island ) he was on 81 % .
In the Bronx , he had a 52-point lead over his nearest rival , Kasich .
Upstate , county after county fell to Trump as the results came in .
On the Democratic side , Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s victory over Bernie Sanders was called about 45 minutes after polls closed .
With over 95 % of the votes tallied , Clinton led 57.7 % to 42.3 % and was firmly ahead in New York City .
The Republican frontrunner arrived at his victory celebration in Midtown Manhattan by entering the lobby of Trump Tower to the strains of Frank Sinatra singing New York , New York , then launched a broadside at the Republican establishment .
â€œItâ€ ™ s impossible to catch us
, â€ � declared the Queens - born tycoon , surrounded by brass , marble and a big TV showing Fox News .
â€œNobody should take delegates and claim victory unless they get those delegates with voters and voting , and thatâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s going to happen .
And you watch because the people arenâ€ ™ t going to stand for it .
Itâ€ ™ s a crooked system , itâ€ ™ s a system thatâ€ ™ s rigged and weâ€
™ re going to go back to the old way :
itâ€ ™ s called you vote and you win.â€
�
He went on to compare the Republicansâ€ ™ nominating process with that of the Democrats , where Sandersâ€ ™ recent string of victories have made little impact on the delegate count .
â€œNobody can take an election away with the way theyâ€ ™ re doing it in the Republican party .
And by the way , I am no fan of Bernie , but Iâ€ ™ ve seen Bernie win , win , win and they say he has no chance of winning .
They have the superdelegates ; the Republican system is worse.â€ �
After the speech , Paul Manafort , who has in effect taken charge of Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign , said : â€œHeâ€ ™ s saying the system is rigged , and the system is rigged .
Itâ€ ™ s rigged in all 50 states where they have different rules that donâ€ ™ t take into account modern political presidential campaigns .
Weâ€
™ re not complaining about the rules , weâ€ ™ re saying the people donâ€ ™ t understand that when they vote , theyâ€ ™ re not necessarily voting for him.â€ �
The GOP race has reached a critical stage in which every delegate counts .
After Tuesday , Trump led with 845 , ahead of Cruz with 559 and Kasich with 147 .
But after recent setbacks in Wisconsin and Wyoming , Trumpâ€ ™ s path to an outright win has become precarious .
If he falls short of that target , he faces the prospect of a contested Republican convention in Cleveland in July , at which his delegates would be free in a second ballot to vote for a different candidate .
There are already signs that he is being outmanoeuvred by Cruz when it comes to recruiting delegates .
Critics say it has exposed his small and slapdash organisation .
â€œTrump hemorrhaging delegates all over the map , â€ � tweeted David Plouffe , campaign manager for Barack Obama in the 2008 election .
â€œEpic political malpractice .
Just epic.â€
�
This makes New York vital both in terms of numbers and perception , with the controversial tycoon hoping to use his victory to regain momentum and reset the narrative to one in which he can set his popular backing against the party establishment and its complicated state - by - state rules for choosing a nominee .
After voting for his father on Tuesday , Donald Trump Jr told the Guardian : â€œI think the Republican party has an opportunity to do something great and bring in a lot of people â€ “ and they have the opportunity to totally blow it and disenfranchise all the people that my fatherâ€ ™ s brought in and everyone else who thought the peopleâ€ ™ s voice mattered .
â€œItâ€
™ s sort of amazing to live in this country and realise that the peopleâ€ ™ s voice doesnâ€
™ t matter because thatâ€ ™ s the way the establishment and the GOP has set it up.â€
�
Trump himself has previously warned that there could be â€œriotsâ€ � , â€œa rough Julyâ€ � and â€œa very , very angry and upset group of people at the conventionâ€ � .
On Tuesday , he voted at a synagogue near Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan , surrounded by a throng of reporters .
It was a â€œgreat honourâ€ � to be able to vote for himself , he said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to go into the convention , I think , as the winner , â€ �
Trump said in his Manhattan victory speech .
â€œI wanna just thank everybody .
I have great , great admiration and praise for the city of New York and the state of New York .
I can think of nowhere I would rather have this victory!â€ �
He added : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have much of a race any more , going by what I see on television .
Senator Cruz â€ ¦ Iâ€ ™ ve pretty much knocked the hell out of him.â€ �
Trump spoke for 10 minutes from a lectern in the lobby of Trump Tower , near the shiny brass lifts that brought many Apprentice contestants down to earth after being fired , the escalator that Trump himself descended last June to announce that he was running for president ( while notoriously referring to Mexican immigrants as criminals , drug dealers and rapists ) and the marble waterfall where he has given countless TV interviews during his improbable campaign .
A giant American flag hung against a blue curtain next to a currency exchange .
Luxury handbags and watches could be seen in a boutique store nearby .
Suited supporters crowded in the lobby chanting : â€œTrump !
Trump !
Trump!â€ � and â€œUSA !
USA !
USA!â€
�
Media from all over the world were crammed in , with only standing room available , but the candidate did not take questions .
Trump has drawn big crowds at rallies across New York state , reiterating his promises to defeat Clinton in a general election , bring back jobs from overseas and build a wall along the Mexican border .
He gained the endorsement of Rudy Giuliani , who was New York Cityâ€ ™ s mayor on the day of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
And he looks set to continue his once unthinkable winning streak on 26 April when Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland , Pennsylvania and Rhode Island vote , with a combined total of 118 delegates at stake .
The demographics appear to favour Trump
and he is doing well in opinion polls there , but he then faces an uphill climb in states that could lean towards Cruz .
There also signs of discord and discontent in his campaign .
After months relying on a shoestring campaign and free publicity , Trump is significantly expanding his staff and spending , with $ 20 m set aside for contests in May and June .
Veteran operative Manafort was hired to mastermind his delegate fight but this has led to a turf war with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , creating rival centres of power .
Trump admitted to Fox News on Tuesday : â€œWhen you bring other people in , I could see some people their feelings get a little bit hurt .
But frankly , you know , weâ€ ™ re in a position where weâ€ ™ d like to see if we can close it out.â€ �
But on Tuesday night he dismissed recent reports of disharmony .
â€œItâ€ ™ s actually a team of unity , itâ€ ™ s evolving , but people donâ€ ™ t understand that .
The press does understand it , they just donâ€ ™ t want to talk about it .
Thatâ€ ™ s OK .
Just keep talking , itâ€ ™ s very important.â€
�
Cruz , who was not allowed to forget his derision of â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � earlier in the campaign , was braced for a poor showing in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s results .
He left the state long before polls closed and spent the day in Pennsylvania , which votes next week , debuting a new stump speech to a crowd of more than 100 people at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia .
Pre - emptively dismissing Trumpâ€ ™ s expected blowout as â€œa politician tonight winning his home stateâ€
� , Cruz sought to reframe himself as outsider similar to Bernie Sanders .
â€œI am an outsider , Bernie Sanders is an outsider , â€ � he said .
â€œBoth with the same diagnosis , but both with very different paths to healing .
Millions of Americans have chosen one of these outsiders , â€ � he said , adding : â€œRonald Reagan and Jack Kennedy were outsiders.â€ �
He also raised comparisons with Obama , introducing â€œyes we willâ€ � as a new slogan in contrast to the presidentâ€ ™ s â€œyes
we canâ€
� .
â€œOur sitting president ran on a slogan that should have been a great first step , â€ � said Cruz .
â€œIt promised us : yes we can.â€ �
Cruz has long railed against â€œthe Washington cartelâ€
�
but this marked a new framing of that message with more optimistic rhetoric .
Kasich , the only other Republican left in the race , was seeking to add to his small delegate total and maintain his attempt to emerge as a viable alternative at the convention .
John Weaver , the Ohio governorâ€ ™ s top strategist , was confident early in the evening that his campaign would pick up some delegates in New York .
He went on to note that Cruzâ€ ™ s collapse in the Empire State presaged what will be a rough night for him next week .
â€œWhat is happening to Cruz in New York is corresponding with what weâ€ ™ re seeing in the other April 26 states
â€
¦ Heâ€
™ s cast in a very narrow lane.â€ �"
2016-04-21,"With both your bloggers on the road with different candidates - Tom McCarthy in Hartford , Connecticut , with Hillary Clinton and myself in Media , Pennsylvania , with John Kasich -
the Guardianâ€ ™ s politics liveblog put an emphasis on the â€œliveâ€ � today .
But beyond the basketball courts of rural Pennsylvania and the meeting halls of central New England , a slew of major national political stories percolated throughout the day .
Here are some of the biggest moments from todayâ€ ™ s campaign trail : Billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump shocked both supporters and detractors on the Today Show this morning when he said that he would have no problem with Caitlyn Jenner using the womenâ€ ™ s bathroom at Trump Tower :
Trump came out against a North Carolina law that criminalizes transgender people using bathrooms that comport with their stated gender identity , arguing that states should â€œLeave it the way
it is.â€ � Conservative firebrand Ted Cruz , who just today released an ad that portrays Trump as a liberal sympathizer , shot back on Twitter , and in his campaignâ€ ™ s swag store : Seated one hour from the Connecticut school where 20 children and six staff members were massacred a little more than three years ago , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton struck an emotional , reflective and urgent tone in appealing to voters to rally against the scourge of gun violence .
â€œThat is 33,000 people a year .
A year , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œIf anything else were killing 33,000 Americans a year , you can bet we would be fully mobilized doing everything we possibly could to save lives.â€ �
With a national debt clock ticking beside him , Ohio governor John Kasich told a crowd of roughly 500 students , employees and locals at Penn Stateâ€ ™ s Brandywine campus in remote Media , Pennsylvania , that if they have a problem , heâ€ ™ s not planning on fixing it .
â€œYou think Iâ€ ™ m gon na fix your drug problem?â€ �
Kasich asked the crowd .
â€œCome on folks .
You wanna fix your drug problem , you fix it right here .
Where do you fix it ?
You fix it in the schools .
You unhappy with your schools ?
Fix â€˜em!â€ �
Kasich continued .
The Trump campaign outlined its general election strategy to the Republican establishment this evening in a closed - door briefing to members of the Republican National Committee , insisting that once voters get to know the real Trump as opposed to the public face he has presented while campaigning and while hosting the NBC reality show The Apprentice , they will warm to him .
Thatâ€ ™ s it from the campaign trail
today - tune in tomorrow for more up - to - the - second news from the 2016 presidential campaign !
In a speech in suburban Philadelphia , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders highlighted comments from vice president Joe Biden in which he lauded Sandersâ€ ™ â€œaspirational
approachâ€ � over opponent
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™
s
â€œcaution.â€ � â€œI donâ€ ™ t think any Democratâ€ ™ s ever won saying , â€˜We canâ€ ™ t think that big - we ought to really downsize here because itâ€ ™ s not realistic , â€ ™ â€ �
Biden told the New York Times .
â€œCâ€ ™ mon man , this is the Democratic party !
Iâ€ ™ m not part of the party that says ,
â€˜Well , we canâ€ ™ t do it.â€
™
â€ �
â€œThe vice president is exactly right ,
â€ �
Sanders told a crowd at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center outside of Philadelphia tonight , after reading the comments aloud .
â€œThis is what this campaign is about : It is about having the courage to face the reality of American life today , understanding that it is not always a pleasant , but having the courage to take on the special interests.â€ � â€œWhat it means is having the courage to envision a nation in which we fulfill the potential we know we have .
It means we end a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires to buy elections.â€

We forgot to mention :
Donald Trump , impatient with the introductions , decided to introduce himself at tonightâ€ ™ s speech in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania .
â€œSo , Iâ€ ™ m supposed to wait a half an hour because there are thousands of people outside trying to get in , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI
canâ€ ™ t do that to you , so we are going to come on right now.â€ �
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never done that before!â€ � he continued , with apparent delight .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never introduced myself !
They didnâ€
™ t quite say it right the first time .
We have thousands of people outside !
Theyâ€ ™ re going to pour in , theyâ€ ™ re filling up the floor .
Letâ€ ™ s start a little bit early.â€
� â€œTo hell with
this!â€ �
Donald Trump took a page from Vermont senator Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ book at a rally in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , tonight , telling the crowd that he didnâ€ ™ t think that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was qualified to serve as president .
â€œHe [
Sanders ] said she suffers from bad judgement and she said â€ “ now I donâ€
™ t know , I think
sheâ€
™ s qualified
, I guess , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œBut that doesnâ€ ™ t mean sheâ€ ™ s good .
He said sheâ€ ™ s not qualified to be president .
Now what he meant is because her judgement is so bad â€ “ so Bernie Sanders , not me , said sheâ€ ™ s not qualified .
So now Iâ€ ™ m going to say : Sheâ€ ™ s not qualified , okay?â€ �
Trump continued , saying that â€œwe have all of the mistakes Hillary made as secretary of stateâ€ � as evidence of her ineptitude .
â€œWe have a mess : The War in Iraq has been devastating , we have probably spent $ 4 trillion in the Middle East.â€
�
Still , Trump said , heâ€ ™ s more excited to run against Clinton than her opponent .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to run against Bernie , â€ � he said .
â€œI want to run against crooked Hillary Clinton .
We are going to beat her so badly .
Is there anyone more crooked than this woman?â€ �
The Trump campaign outlined their general election strategy to the Republican establishment this evening in a closed - door briefing to members of the Republican National Committee .
Over heaping piles of seafood , plates of cheese and an open bar , newly hired Trump campaign staffers Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley as well as former presidential rival Ben Carson at the Diplomat Resort and Spa in Hollywood , Florida , tried to sell longtime party activists on their candidateâ€ ™ s ability to beat Hillary Clinton in November .
This comes as part of a new charm offensive by Trump to become more of a traditional candidate that will include a foreign policy speech Wednesday at the National Press Club .
The major and controversial shift in campaign strategy comes as Manafort has worked to sideline campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , who has urged the necessity of continuing to let â€œTrump be Trumpâ€ � and maintaining an unconventional outsider campaign .
Brushing past any concern that Trump might not be the nominee , Manafort and Wiley set out a general election argument where they insisted that Trumpâ€ ™
s high negatives could be overcome .
A recent NBC / Wall Street Journal poll showed that 65 % of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Republican frontrunner .
They insisted , however , that once voters got to know the real Trump as opposed to the public face he has presented while campaigning and while hosting the NBC reality show The Apprentice , they will warm to him .
He said that persona was just an act .
Manafort told reporters after the meeting : â€œWe just have to present him in a way that shows all sides of Donald Trump.â€ �
They insisted to attendees that Clintonâ€ ™ s negatives were far harder to overcome and based on personality as well .
Clinton is currently viewed negatively by 56 % of voters according to the same poll .
Notably , Manafort referred to Clinton as Crooked Hillary within the briefing , using the nickname that Trump bestowed upon her .
The two staffers also laid out a state - by - state general election path for Trump .
The Trump officials had two tiers of targets .
The first group consisted of states George W Bush won in 2004 and that Barack Obama won in 2008 .
These include perennial swing states such as Ohio , Florida , Iowa and Nevada .
The second group was what they described as â€œsteel statesâ€ � , which have not gone Republican since 1988 : Pennsylvania , Michigan , Wisconsin , Minnesota and Connecticut .
There , they believed that Trump could win over former Democrats and edge out Clinton .
However , they relied on public polling data that , in some cases , was months old to make this argument and Trump was not winning in a single one of those states .
Manafort and Wiley also took pains to reassure Republican party officials that they would work with state parties to raise money and support downballot candidates in November .
As Manafort noted to reporters afterwards , the conversation was not just about expanding the map but how the campaign would â€œwork with state parties to change the mapâ€ � .
This was meant to reassure longtime party officials inside the room that the Trump campaign had turned the page .
As Matt Moore , the chair of the South Carolina Republican party described it , â€œit was a peace offeringâ€ � that they would raise money and help state parties after the frontrunner had spent much of the campaign railing against party elders .
Steve Duprey , a national committeeman from New Hampshire , told reporters : â€œThey did more to reassure us that the Trump campaign is building out their infrastructure and understands the financial challenges of the general election.â€ �
Speaking about the shakeup in the campaign , he added : â€œI think all of us who have been at this a long time are more reassured that they are doing this with folks who done this before.â€ �
There are some lines that even a politician wonâ€ ™ t cross : Donald Trump will change Republican party rules to make the nomination process more uniform if he becomes the GOP presidential candidate , Ben Carson said on Thursday .
In response to a question from the Guardian , Carson â€ “ once a rival to Trump in the Republican race and now one of the billionaireâ€ ™ s most high - profile backers
â€ “ said that he thought Trump was committed to changing the rules of the Republican Party so that they would be â€œconsistent across the country and not this way here and that way thereâ€ � .
He added : â€œThe only reason [ for the current system ] is if you wanted to manipulate the system.â€ �
A source inside the briefing confirmed to the Guardian that Carson made similar remarks inside the room .
Carson , who was appearing as a surrogate for Trump at the RNCâ€ ™ s spring meeting in Hollywood , Florida , condemned the current system of nominating a Republican nominee as â€œcorruptâ€ � .
In an email to campaign supporters , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is using a major strike at Verizon Wireless as an example of the kinds of economic excesses he has built his campaign railing against - and as an opportunity to raise money .
â€œThe CEO of Verizon makes almost $ 20 million a year in compensation .
He leads one of the most profitable companies in the country , â€ � Sanders writes .
â€œYet Verizon wants to take away employeesâ€ ™ health benefits .
Verizon wants to outsource decent - paying jobs .
Verizon wants to avoid paying federal income tax .
And right now , Verizon is refusing to sit down and negotiate a fair contract with its employees.â€ � â€œIn other words , Verizon is just another major American corporation trying to destroy the lives of working Americans ,
â€ � he continues .
â€œBut this time , Verizonâ€ ™ s employees are fighting back .
Thousands of very brave employees of Verizon and Verizon Wireless are on strike until they can get a fair contract .
They made a very difficult decision that puts their families at risk - but itâ€ ™ s a choice they made to stand up for justice against corporate greed.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m asking you today to stand up and tell the CEO of Verizon that you think Verizon employees deserve a fair contract that protects health benefits , guarantees fair pay , and stops outsourcing , â€ � he concludes .
Earlier this month , Sanders walked the picket line with Verizon protesters in New York , telling the roaring crowd that â€œYou have chosen to stand up for dignity.â€
�
Nearly 40,000 Verizon Communications workers walked off the job two weeks ago in in one of the largest US strikes in recent years after contract talks hit an impasse .
The debate over whether to give the citizens of Washington , DC the right to representation in Congress has always had an undercurrent of partisanship : The heavily Democratic city would almost certainly add two hard - left Democrats into the mix in the US Senate , plus a deep blue representative in the House of Representatives .
Most Republicans typically distance themselves from endorsing the Districtâ€ ™ s disenfranchisement for purely political reasons - it doesnâ€
™ t look good to declare
that a federal district with a population larger than three states should be deprived of congressional representation because that population leans left .
Ohio governor John Kasich , however , was readily honest about the issue during a meeting with the Washington Postâ€ ™ s editorial board .
â€œWhat it really gets down to if you want to be honest is because they know thatâ€ ™ s just more votes in the Democratic Party , â€ � Kasich told the board about the movement to give congressional representation to Washingtonians .
( The US constitution does not allow the federal district representation , as it is not a state . )
Kasich had voted against a measure that would give DC statehood while he served in the House of Representatives , and told the board that â€œYes , I would it say probably
isâ€
� still
his position on the matter .
When asked if it was true that â€œif there were Republicans in the District , you would have a different position?â€ � Kasich demurred .
â€œItâ€
™ s kind of hard for me to argue against it .
Iâ€ ™
d have to hear what the argument is.â€ � Hillary Clinton on gun violence : That is 33,000 people a year .
A year .
If anything else were killing 33,000 Americans a year , you can bet we would be fully mobilized doing everything we possibly could to save lives .
It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun to solve their problems .
It makes no sense .
A man who piloted a one - person gyrocopter through some of the most restricted US airspace and landed on the lawn of the Capitol in Washington has been sentenced to 120 days behind bars , according to the Associated Press .
Florida resident Douglas Hughes has said his April 2015 flight in the bare - bones aircraft , which began in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , was a way to call attention to the influence of big money in politics .
Hughes pleaded guilty in November to a felony for operating a gyrocopter without a license .
Prosecutors asked he be sentenced to 10 months in prison , arguing that the former mail carrier from Ruskin , Florida , put countless lives at risk .
Hughesâ€ ™ attorneys argued he should be allowed to remain out of jail .
Hughes was carrying letters for each member of Congress on the topic of campaign finance and the tail of his aircraft had a postal service logo .
In a court document they filed ahead of the sentencing hearing , prosecutors argued Hughesâ€ ™ flight â€œput unsuspecting people in real danger , disrupted operations at the United States Capitol , and demonstrated a profound disrespect for the law and the legitimate rights of othersâ€ � .
Hughes â€œcraved attentionâ€ � and â€œviolated important public safety laws because he wanted people to pay attention to his political viewsâ€ � , they wrote .
As we liveblog from the back of a bus on the outskirts of Philadelphia , we can say with confidence that we may have gone to the wrong campaign event today :
Texas senator Ted Cruz is raising money off of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s comments this morning in favor of allowing transgender Americans to use public restrooms that comport with their stated gender identity , offering supporters the chance to pre - order a Trump - style red cap with the phrase â€œMAKE PC GREAT AGAINâ€ � emblazoned above the brim .
Trump surprised many voters this morning when he told NBCâ€ ™ s Today Show that he opposed
so - called â€œbathroom billsâ€ � like the one recently passed in North Carolina that criminalize using public restrooms that donâ€ ™ t match the gender stated on a personâ€ ™ s birth certificate .
â€œNorth Carolina did something that was very strong and theyâ€ ™ re paying a big price .
And thereâ€ ™ s a lot of problems ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œLeave it the way it is .
North Carolina , what theyâ€ ™ re going through , with all of the business and all of the strife - and thatâ€ ™ s on both sides - you leave it the way it is .
There have been very few complaints the way it is .
People go , they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate .
There has been so little trouble.â€ � Cruz , whose social conservatism has prompted frequent critiques of Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œNew York values , â€ � hit back with the hat and a tweet that characterized Trumpâ€ ™ s comments as â€œfacilitating putting little girls alone in a bathroomâ€ � with grown men .
Buzzfeed News has obtained archival footage of billionaire Republican frontruner Donald Trump telling NBC Nightly News that a woman who accused boxer Mike Tyson of rape - of which he was later convicted - had only herself to blame .
â€œYou have a young woman that was in his hotel room late in the evening at her own will , â€ �
Trump in the video , which originally aired in February 1992 .
â€œYou have a young woman seen dancing for the beauty contest - dancing with a big smile on her face , looked happy as can
be.â€ �
â€œItâ€ ™ s my opinion that to a large extent , Mike Tyson was railroaded in this case ,
â€ �
Trump said later in the video .
In 1992 , an Indiana jury found Tyson , who has endorsed Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential bid , guilty of raping an 18-year - old beauty pageant contestant .
Desiree Washington , who held the title of Miss Black Rhode Island at the time , testified that sexually assaulted her in an Indianapolis hotel room .
Facing a maximum of 60 years in prison , Tyson was sentenced to six and served three .
Ahead of the so - called â€œAcela primariesâ€ � next week , Texas senator Ted Cruz has released three new advertisements as part of a statewide buy in Pennsylvania , in the hopes that the Keystone State will get reacquainted with him after his blistering loss in the New York Republican primary earlier this week .
The first ad , titled Right , is a 19-second spot that aims to contrast Cruzâ€ ™ s plan for the nation with that of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton .
â€œObama was a failure , â€ � the announcer declares .
â€œHillary could be worse .
We have to get this right .
Ted Cruz will .
Repeal ObamaCare .
Grow jobs .
Destroy ISIS.â€ �
â€œJobs , freedom , security :
Cruz.â€
�
The second advertisement , Solutions , is a 30-second spot that lauds the Texas senator as caring more about Americaâ€ ™ s future than â€œbickeringâ€ � with his opponents like schoolchildren .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering schoolchildren ,
â€ �
Cruz says in the ad .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re interested in solutions , not slogans .
This is the single moms , the truck - drivers and the steelworkers and the mechanics with callouses on their hands .
This is all the young people coming out of school that arenâ€ ™ t able to find a job.â€ � â€œAs president , I will repeal Obamacare , pull back the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing .
Weâ€ ™ re going to see wages going up , weâ€ ™ re going to see opportunity .
We need a president who stands with the American people.â€ �
In Not Easy ,
Cruzâ€ ™ s
third ad , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign lumps Clinton together with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump as a pair of wealthy elites
who â€œjust donâ€ ™ t get
it.â€
� Quoting Clinton , who told Diane Sawyer that she took immense speaking fees because â€œwe came out of the White House not only dead - broke but in debt , â€ � and Trump , who told a debate audience that â€œIt has not been easy for me ...
My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars , â€ � an announcer intones : â€œThey just donâ€
™ t get it .
Ted Cruz does .
Thatâ€ ™ s why heâ€ ™ ll cut taxes for working families .
Roll back regulations .
And repeal ObamaCare .
Jobs , freedom , security for you .
For a change.â€ �
With a national debt clock ticking beside him , Ohio governor John Kasich told a crowd of roughly 500 students , employees and locals at Penn Stateâ€ ™ s Brandywine campus in remote Media , Pennsylvania , that if they have a problem , heâ€ ™ s not planning on fixing it .
â€œYou think Iâ€ ™ m gon na fix your drug problem?â€ �
Kasich asked the crowd .
â€œCome on folks .
You wanna fix your drug problem , you fix it right here .
Where do you fix it ?
You fix it in the schools.â€ � â€œYou unhappy with your schools ?
Fix â€˜em!â€
�
Katich continued .
â€œWhy
donâ€
™ t you just do it -
why donâ€ ™ t you just fix it ?
What are we waiting on?â€
� â€œYou worried about poverty ?
Welfare ?
Thatâ€ ™ s not a hard one to fix either , really , â€ � Kasich told the crowd .
( According to US census data , about 6.1 % of families and 7.9 % of the population of Media live below the poverty line , including 9.7 % of those under age 18 and 11.2 % of those age 65 or over . )
â€œWhy
donâ€ ™ t we start fixing things ?
Why donâ€ ™ t we believe in ourselves?â€
�
The largely working - class crowd was muted for most of his speech , with the largest bout of applause reserved for a line that seemed to run counter to his narrative of community - based self sufficiency : â€œYour job , if youâ€ ™ re a public official , is to raise peoplesâ€ ™ lives .
If youâ€ ™ re not doing that , then get out - plain and simple.â€ �
The Ohio governor highlighted his connection to Pennsylvania and its Rust Belt citizens , describing a hardscrabble childhood as the son of a coal miner in a town where â€œif the wind blew the wrong way , people found themselves out of work.â€ � Pointing to a counter that ticked away the amount of American national debt , Kasich attempted to explain the connection between sovereign debt and the local economy in Media .
â€œWhen
this number goes up , the number of jobs for our graduates goes down .
And when that number goes down , the number of job opportunities for our families goes up , â€ � Kasich said .
But despite the ticker and the opening monologue about local political change as the engine for economic growth , Kasich spent most of his time in Media attempting to distance himself both from his â€œradicalâ€ � primary opponents and the Republican establishment .
Describing the Republican Party as â€œmy vehicle , and not my master , â€ �
Kasich told the chuckling audience that â€œthe only person that tells me what to do is my wife.â€
�
â€œThe anxieties are real , people feel really ripped off in many cases , and I think it;s being fed in a lot of cases by talk radio , and talk television , â€ � Kasich said , of the reason that the Republican Party appears so divided in this election cycle .
His opponentsâ€ ™ argument is â€œthat theyâ€ ™ re throwing all the pieces off the chess board so they can start the game over again.â€ � â€œAnger sells .
Strife sells , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œBut thatâ€ ™ s not where we wanna live , is it?â€ � Kasich left after speaking and answering questions for roughly 45 minutes .
When he began , the national debt clock was at $ 19,252,130,990,144,000 and change .
When he left , the national debt clock had risen by more than $ 48 billion , to $ 19,252,179,093,543,000 and change .
John Kasich , apparently an action - movie buff , used the example of a James Bond chase scene to describe how the US can fight international terrorism .
In a town hall here at the Brandywine campus of Penn State in Media , Pennsylvania , the father of a 9/11 survivor asked Kasich whether he would use â€œall of Americaâ€ ™ s tools and power - military , economic , moral - to keep our country safe?â€ � First off , Kasich said , he would streamline the military and its attendant contractors .
â€œWe have more people working in bureaucratic functions than we have people actually serving in the military , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œThe United States is gon na have to be involved in heaping the world to come together in two areas : intelligence gathering and policing.â€
�
Then , he made a somewhat tortured reference to â€œthe helicopter sceneâ€ � in Spectre , the most recent James Bond film , which Kasich had watched on the campaign jet the night before .
â€œLike him , we need to pull out of this , have confidence in ourselves , and have leaders who donâ€ ™ t promise what they canâ€ ™ t deliver.â€ � Opening with a monologue about the importance of small communities in solving their own problems , the Ohio governor pointed to the example of Harriet Tubman , the newly minted face of the $ 20 bill .
â€œShe wasnâ€ ™ t some big shot - she became a big shot because of what she did , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œShe started a movement - she drove change from the bottom up .
She saw something that she thought was just patently unfair .
This lady just put one foot in front of the otherâ€ ¦ and just changed the world.â€
�
A trio of college students was mostly pleased that John Kasich had bothered to visit the far - flung campus at all .
â€œNot many of the candidates come to a smaller satellite campus - they go to the main campus , or they go to Penn in Philly , â€ � said Rob Hale , a two - tour veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who studies business at Penn State .
â€œIf you take the time to come out to a smaller campus , it says something.â€ � â€œItâ€ ™ s a rare opportunity to take advantage of a real candidate out here , â€ � agreed his friend Vince Scrocca , also a business major .
â€œIâ€ ™ m actually a Trump guy ,
â€ �
admitted Tom Clark , a business and finance major who sported a grey â€œTrump for Presidentâ€ � T - shirt underneath his polar fleece .
â€œI think theyâ€ ™ re all pretty crooked.â€ �
Hale , a former Marine who probably knew more about federal policy on opioids than most college students , told the Guardian that the issue that motivated him to hear Kasich speech was reform in the Department of Veteran Affairs and , conjointly , marijuana decriminalization .
â€œ[Twenty - four ] states have legalized its use , at least medically , but on the federal level itâ€ ™ s still a schedule - one drug , â€ �
Hale said passionately .
â€œA candidate needs to be forward - thinking enough to look into new solutions for our health care problems .
You know , our debt is increasing a lot because of the War on Drugs.â€ � â€œI was in the Marine Corps , fighting with the British SAS , and so many vets are hopped up on opioids because the VA canâ€ ™ t put money or research into anything else , â€ � Hale continued .
â€œTwenty - two vets a day kill themselves , and Iâ€ ™ m sure if you added opioid abuse to that number , itâ€ ™ d be higher.â€ �
Iâ€ ™ m here at the Brandywine campus of Penn State in Media , Pennsylvania , where Ohio governor John Kasich is about to participate in a town hall event in front of this national debt ticker : Ted Cruz is hunting hard for votes in Indiana , which holds its primary on 3 May :
The anti - Trump Our Principles Pac has released a memo throwing water on the idea that the Trump campaign has gained new momentum of some sort after the real estate mogulâ€ ™
s resounding win in New York this week .
â€œDespite Trumpâ€ ™ s victory in New York on Tuesday night
, he still has a nearly impossible path to secure the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot ,
â€ � the memo argues .
It continues : Looking ahead to the 5 primaries on April 26 , our planning assumes Trump can win nearly all of the bound delegates without improving his very slim chances .
Yesterday morning , the Trump campaign apparently released a memo claiming a road ahead that is , quite frankly , detached from reality .
There is no plausible scenario by which Trump can secure 1,400 bound delegates prior to the start of the convention .
In order to secure 1,400 delegates , he would have to win 82 % of all remaining delegates , a task simply not possible for him or any candidate at this stage in the process .

Donald Trump would have no problem with Caitlyn Jenner using the womenâ€ ™ s bathroom at Trump Tower , he said during a town hall event on NBCâ€ ™ s Today show .
Trump was asked his views on North Carolinaâ€ ™ s controversial new law that requires transgender people to use bathrooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificates .
Noting the backlash against the law , Trump said the state should â€œleave it the way it is right nowâ€ � .
â€œWhat theyâ€ ™ re going through with all the business thatâ€ ™ s leaving , all of the strife â€ “ and
this is on both sides .
Leave it the way it is , â€ �
Trump said , apparently referring to the number of businesses boycotting the stateâ€ ™ s law .
Asked if he has any transgender people working for him , Trump said : â€œI really donâ€ ™ t know .
I probably do .
I really donâ€
™ t know.â€
�
He said if transgender celebrity Caitlyn Jenner came to Trump Tower , she could use â€œwhatever bathroom
she wantedâ€ � .
Conservative firebrand Ted Cruz , who just today released an ad that portrays Trump as a liberal sympathizer , shot back on twitter .
Trump meanwhile wasnâ€ ™ t as jazzed at the news that abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman will replace the slaveholding seventh president , Andrew Jackson , on the front of the $ 20 bill .
Trump said he would prefer that Tubmanâ€ ™ s face grace the rare $ 2 bill .
â€œI think Harriet Tubman is fantastic , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI would love to leave Andrew Jackson and see if we can maybe come up with another denomination .
Maybe we do a $ 2 bill.â€
�
Politicians are reacting on Twitter to the reported death of pop god Prince : New York has voted , but
itâ€ ™ s never too late for Mark Ruffalo and Bernie Sanders to take a stroll through Brooklyn ?
A man who identifies himself as an OB / GYN from neighboring Windsor stands up and praises Clinton for not being a robot .
â€œI also want to say that you are very human , â€ � the man says .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t care what they say
but you are very human.â€
�
Clinton has a winsome reply : â€œWell , I hope somebody got that on film ,
doctor!â€ �
Then she says they have to wrap it up .
Clinton calls on â€œthat gentleman over there against the wall with that very attractive portrait of me on it.â€ �
He identifies himself as a â€œ30-year - old , Latino , gay physicianâ€ � and says that heâ€ ™ s touched by the link between the need for better mental health care and gun violence .
He says caregivers feel â€œstrainâ€ � to fill the holes in social services and mental health care gaps .
Clinton thanks him for his work and for his perspective .
Clinton is asked about targeting illiteracy .
She says that â€œamong the frustrations that people face is the feeling that they have not been successful academically.â€ � â€œI think we have to have a set of interventions and opportunities , â€ � Clinton says .
â€œThose first five years of life are critical at getting children to succeed ,
â€ � she says .
She says that families must be the first educators of children , and describes an adult literacy program for parents that she brought to Arkansas .
â€œIn the schools , Iâ€ ™ m saying something thatâ€ ™ s so obvious , our public schools are being starved of resources ... if we donâ€
™ t pay attention to everything that goes on in schools ..
and then we need constant , continuing learning.â€ �
Clinton has a lot of enthusiasm for talking about schools .
Another question from the audience .
â€œMy heart is so with you and everyone else in the room.â€ �
She says 20 years before Sandy Hook , a friendâ€ ™ s son was killed at a college at 22 years old .
She says the whole thing happened because legislators loosened ammunition sales laws .
â€œIâ€ ™ m so happy that you are running because your experience , your networkâ€ �
â€ “ the questioner says president Obama was elected too soon and does not have Clintonâ€ ™ s network .
â€œYou are the only person that has the capability out of everybody thatâ€ ™ s running to change our nation , â€ � the questioner says .
Clinton says â€œit has to be a continuing commitment .
I will say this .
In political terms , the gun lobby never rests , and they only have one issue they care about .
All the rest of us ... we care about a lot of things .
The other side cares about one thing.â€ �
Clinton appeals to the audience to ,
in addition to everything else they care about , â€œplease , please make comprehensive gun safety reform at the top of your list.â€ �
A member of the audience at the Clinton event who identifies himself as a pastor stands to tell his personal story .
â€œMy prayer is that you get elected , because you seem to want to hear the pain , â€ � he tells Clinton .
â€œWelcome to the 06120 , the poorest zip code in the state of Connecticut , â€ � he begins .
He says his son was shot dead in the back in October 2012 as a 20-year - old by a 20-year - old .
â€œIt ripped a hole in my life , â€ � he says .
â€œDeath beat me like this ?
Death does this to me , and God doesnâ€ ™ t answer ?
Iâ€ ™ ve never been able to go back home again .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ll never be able as a country to go back home again ....
Americaâ€ ™ s narrative has been changed because of gun culture in this county .
â€œI felt guilty about the loss of my son.â€ �
CLinton replies : â€œLet the congregation say ,
Amen.â€ � Clinton : â€œI want to be the president for the struggling and the striving .
I want to be the president who finally figures out how we do provide more resources , starting with early childhood education ...
â€œAnd I want to say a very special word about the foster care system .
When children are removed from a home , and put in a foster care system , I believe they become all our children .
â€œI want to make sure that these children do not get lost .
That they donâ€ ™ t have a worse situation.â€ �
Governor Dannel Malloy speaks from the audience .
Too many states have failed to respond to the threat of gun violence , he says .
â€œIf this industry was treated like every other industry in America , we wouldnâ€ ™ t have problems like we have today , â€ � Malloy says .
He says that Connecticut is home to big pharmaceutical companies that are heavily regulated and it makes them safer and better .
The same should be in place for guns , he says .
Hartford mayor Luke Bronin then thanks Clinton for coming and visiting â€œHartford , especially north Hartford , Alabany Avenue.â€
�
Heâ€ ™ s applauded .
Clinton says that people on the terrorist watch list should not be able to buy guns as a matter of law .
Then she says that immunity from liability for gun manufacturers should be repealed - she mentions that Sanders voted in favor of such immunity .
â€œWe ned a very big tent ...
I am absolutely determined to make this into an issue that can not be ignored , â€ � Clinton says .
Clinton says she wishes to summarize â€œthe various aspects of the epidemic we are facing.â€
� Some are rooted in the mental health system , she says .
â€œYou see someone suffering from untreated mental health , people back off.â€ �
But another problem is victim blaming
she says â€ “ or blaming the vicimâ€ ™ s family , or neighborhood .
Itâ€ ™ s wrong , Clinton says , to â€œtry to find somebody to blame instead of saying , you know what , we just have too many guns in this country , in the wrong hands
and we need to address
it.â€
� â€œI find it absolutely indefensible , the arguments that are made by people who will not accept responsibility for what is happening in our country , â€ � Clinton says , following a rounsing talk by Melba Marquez - Greene , who lost her 6-year - old daughter Ana Grace in the Sandy Hook shooting .
Clinton says Marquez - Greene gave Clinton the book she and her daughter had been reading the night before the daughter was killed , for Clinton to read to her daughter ( or perhaps granddaughter ) .
â€œWhen you take a stand against the gun lobby , you are subject to some of the most vile harassment on the internet , â€ � Clinton says .
â€œErica found that out when she decidedâ€ � to speak out .
â€œThis is not some kind of free opportunity for any of the panelists .
Theyâ€ ™ ve put themselves in the public , some for the first time on the national level , and itâ€ ™ s important that those of us who want to support them stand up for them.â€ � Kimberly Washington , founder of the New Haven - based anti - gun violence group Mothers Demand Action , said she got involved in the issue because â€œI canâ€ ™ t just watch young people , our children , killing each other every single day.â€
�
â€œLike Erica said , New Haven ?
We got Sandy Hook every day ,
â€ � Washington says .
â€œFor all the people who came out today , you need to think about , it could be someone in your family that this could happen to.â€ � Iran Nazario , director of community outreach at Compass peacebuilders youth collaborative in Hartford , is telling the story of his youthful gang involvement , which culminated in a prison sentence for him and the murder of his brother .
â€œThere are kids out there whose souls are trapped , and they need us , and they need these laws and they need this control , â€ � Nazario says .
Clinton insert an explanation that Nazario ended up in foster care with his brothers and sisters .
She says she wants to expand on the gangs issue .
â€œJoining a gang is like having a family , â€ � Clinton says ...
â€œSo weâ€ ™ re either gon na have gangs that murder and rob .. or weâ€ ™ re gon na have positive gangs ,
weâ€ ™ re gon na have positive alternatives for young people.â€ �
She says most gun violence deaths affect young African American and Latino men , and that the leading cause of death for young African American men â€ “ more than the next nine causes combined â€ “ is gun violence .
Erica Smegielski is the first to speak .
â€œPrior
to that day , I was one of those people who didnâ€ ™ t have gun violence on my radar ,
â€ �
she says of the Sandy Hook shooting .
The reality is , my mom was murdered , and she is not coming back no matter how hard I fight ... what I can do is stand up and use my voice , and use my story , in order to motivate other people to use their voice and share their story , and come together on this issue .
Iâ€ ™ m asking each of you to get involved , before you find out the hard way .
Smelgieski says the problem goes beyond Sandy Hook .
Mass shootings are the minority .
What we have to focus on is the everyday gun violence that plagues our cities , that plagues our streets that plagues our towns .
Clinton sketches a few of her leading policy prescriptions on guns : comprehensive background checks and closing the so - called gun show loophole and the Charleston loophole , by which gun purchases are allowed to go forward without background checks if the checks take more than three days .
The shooter in the June 2015 church massacre in Charleston , SC , obtained a gun through such a loophole .
â€œI am not here to make promises we canâ€
™ t keep , â€ � Clinton says .
â€œI am here to tell you
I will use every minute of every single day if Iâ€ ™ m fortunate enough to become president ... to change gun culture .
It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun to solve their problems .
It makes no sense.â€ �
Clinton says that sensible gun control reform is possible within the guidelines of the second amendment .
Hillary Clinton has taken the stage in the Hartford YMCA gym , and is introduced by Erica Smegielski , daughter of slain Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung .
Smegielski calls Clinton â€œmy partner in this fight.â€
�
The issue of gun violence is â€œpersonal for Connecticut , â€ � Smegielski says ,
â€œand not just because of Sandy Hook , which we all lived
, you lived that with me , â€ �
but because of daily gun violence .
Clinton begins : â€œIf anything else were killing 33,000 Americans a year , you can bet weâ€ ™ d be fully mobilized , doing anything we possibly could to save lives.â€ �
Asked in an appearance on morning TV about her prospects for attracting Bernie Sanders supporters
should he â€ “ once he ?
â€
“ withdraws from the nominating race
, Hillary Clinton drew on a convenient analogy : her own withdrawal from the 2008 nominating race .
â€œI know something about this , â€ � she said , â€œbecause people remember that president Obama and I ran a really tough race for the entire primary season , and he ended up with more delegates , and I withdrew , I endorsed him and then I got to work.â€
�
She continued : And remember , when I withdrew in June of 2008 , polls were showing that at least 40 % of my supporters said that oh , they werenâ€ ™ t going to support Senator Obama .
So I had to get to work , and I had to make the case
, I nominated him at the convention , i went from group to group ... convincing people who were my delegates to come together , to unify , because what then - senator Obama had in common was much greater than our differences .
Iâ€ ™ m confident that weâ€ ™ ll all join together .
California is the biggest prize in the US presidential primary cycle â€ “ and , as Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and John Kasich will discover when they travel to the state later this month , the most complicated , demanding and expensive political battlefield , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Maria L La Ganga : For decades , the state has been irrelevant to presidential nomination contests .
With its primaries on the tail end of the election cycle , the last time the Golden State mattered to Democrats was in 1972 , and California has not been relevant to Republicans since 1964 .
This year is different .
If Trump is to either win the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination or get close enough to effectively seal victory , then the finish line will be marked in California .
For Cruz , Kasich and much of the Republican establishment , the contest is likely to be their last chance to stop the businessman .
There are other important contests that will come first â€ “ particularly the one held in Indiana .
[ For more on the importance of Indiana click here . ]
But none is expected to have a bigger impact on the outcome of the race than California .
Trump hopes to perform well there in June off the back of his convincing victory in New York on Tuesday , which followed a string of losses .
Read the full piece here : As we wait for Clinton to take the stage , letâ€ ™ s take a quick look at what else is happening on the campaign landscape .
Hereâ€ ™ s one thatâ€ ™ s as hard to miss as it is to make sense of :
Ted Cruz has produced a new video ad with actors portraying Hillary Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin detailing the opposition research file against Donald Trump .
Itâ€ ™ s a fairly nasty , and letâ€ ™ s just go ahead and call it sexist , ad for its depiction of Clinton , whose stand - in wears deeply furrowed lines on her upper lip ( is that a prosthesis ? ) to express age .
This is Clinton - as - crone .
After the strategy team in the ad gets through slides detailing Trumpâ€ ™ s misdeeds and weaknesses , which make them chortle , the Clinton character is handed a file which opens to reveal Ted Cruz and then she is advised that there would be no way to beat Cruz in a general election .
When in fact airing this ad for the majority of Americans who donâ€ ™ t subscribe to insane Huma Abedin conspiracy theories would probably work pretty well as an illustration of some of Cruzâ€ ™ s potential flaws .
Weâ€
™ re inside the Wilson - Gray YMCA in Hartford , Connecticut , where Hillary Clinton is scheduled to hold a discussion with family members of gun violence victims .
Hundreds of people queued for hours outside , and many were still waiting to be admitted to the event , staged at one end of the Y gym ( there are enough attendees to fill a basketball court , and enough media to field multiple teams ) .
The gym has been adapted for the occasion with three US flags of descending size , two Connecticut flags and a lot of folding chairs .
Hanging next to the stage are four banners with pictures of happy kids reading â€œcool , â€ �
â€œsuper , â€ �
â€œwowâ€ � and â€œmagic.â€
�
In conjunction with this morningâ€ ™ s event , the Clinton campaign has released a video ad featuring Erica Smegielski , daughter of Dawn Hochsprung , the principal who was among the six educators killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary attack .
â€œMy mom was murdered while trying to protect the children in her care from a gunman , â€ � says Smegielski : No one is fighting harder to reform our gun laws than Hillary Clinton .
She is the only candidate who has what it takes to take on the gun lobby .
She reminds me of my mother .
She isnâ€ ™ t afraid of anything .
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Weâ€ ™ re running the blog this morning from Hartford , Connecticut , where Hillary Clinton is about to convene a meeting with family members of victims of gun violence , including families of victims of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school , about 50 miles west of here .
Later today the blog will jump to Philadelphia , to be typed from the scene of a rally for stalwart Republican hopeful John Kasich .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Lois Beckett reported on Wednesday that families of Sandy Hook victims are suing the maker , distributor and dealer of the Bushmaster rifle used in the shooting : The companiesâ€ ™ militaristic marketing of the AR-15 style rifles is at the center of the suit .
From a legal perspective , experts say , the lawsuit has a remote chance of success .
But it has gained political prominence in the Democratic presidential race , with Hillary Clinton using her support for the lawsuit as a rallying point on her way to victory in the New York state primary , and Bernie Sanders facing increasing criticism for his comments against it .
In the messy fight for the Republican nomination , meanwhile , the partyâ€ ™ s national committee has convened its spring meeting at a luxury seaside resort in South Florida .
Ted Cruz and Kasich are in attendance , while Donald Trump has dispatched top aides to make his case for the nomination .
While the distinguished party figures in attendance have the power to tailor rules for how the Republican nominee is selected at Julyâ€ ™ s national convention , RNC chairman Reince Priebus reportedly opposes taking such a step in the current round of meetings , out of ( extremely well founded ) concerns that any rules revision would be brandished by Trump as further evidence of a rigged system .
Bernie Sanders shared good news late Wednesday , in the form of a Federal Elections Commission filing , with supporters disappointed with his loss in New York : in March his campaign raised nearly $ 46 m , to only $ 29.3 m for Clinton .
And yet : Thanks for reading and as always join us in the comments .
Weâ€ ™ ll be blogging from inside the Hartford YMCA shortly ."
2016-04-21,"California is the biggest prize in the US presidential primary cycle â€ “ and , as Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and John Kasich will discover when they travel to the state later this month , the most complicated , demanding and expensive political battlefield .
For decades , the state has been irrelevant to presidential nomination contests .
With its primaries on the tail end of the election cycle , the last time the Golden State mattered to Democrats was in 1972 , and California has not been relevant to Republicans since 1964 .
This year is different .
If Trump is to either win the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination or get close enough to effectively seal victory , then the finish line will be marked in California .
For Cruz , Kasich and much of the Republican establishment , the contest is likely to be their last chance to stop the businessman .
There are other important contests that will come first â€ “ particularly the one held in Indiana .
But none is expected to have a bigger impact on the outcome of the race than California .
Trump hopes to perform well there in June off the back of his convincing victory in New York on Tuesday , which followed a string of losses .
Whatever happens , Californiaâ€ ™ s
172 delegates donâ€ ™ t come cheap .
â€œCalifornia is a challenge to any candidate running , â€ � said former state senator Jim Brulte , chairman of the state Republican party.â€œA statewide media buy is probably $ 2.5 m to $ 2.8 m a week.â€ �
Unlike New Hampshire or South Carolina , he added : â€œyou canâ€ ™ t organize a state of 40 million peopleâ€ � .
The state is also a challenge because the Republican contest in California has a structure that bedevils pretty much any candidate who makes it to the end of the primary season .
For starters , only registered Republicans are allowed to vote .
The more moderate members of Californiaâ€ ™ s Grand Old Party have mostly peeled off and registered as â€œno party preferenceâ€ � .
Although theyâ€ ™ ll be able to weigh in on the Democratic race , they canâ€ ™ t help someone like the ailing Kasich , the most centrist of the remaining trio of Republican contenders , all of whom will speak at the state party convention , just south of San Francisco , later this month .
Californiaâ€ ™ s contest , like the one that has just taken place in New York , is less of a single primary than a slew of mini - races .
There will be 53 separate winner - take - all races on 7 June â€ “ one for every congressional district .
So it doesnâ€
™
t matter how many Republicans there are in any one district because each is worth exactly three delegates .
That means that the most liberal districts , which have the lowest number of registered Republicans , become the most sought - after to Republican presidential candidates , who can claim victory by reaching just a small number of voters .
Republican US representative
Tom McClintockâ€ ™ s central California district , for example , has 175,401 registered Republicans .
In contrast , Democratic US representative Nancy Pelosiâ€ ™ s San Francisco district has just 30,619 registered Republicans .
So how does a Republican win in a district like Pelosiâ€ ™ s ?
â€œThe honest answer is , â€˜We donâ€ ™ t knowâ€ ™ ,â€ � said Dan Schnur , director of the Jesse M Unruh Institute of Politics at USC .
â€œThere arenâ€ ™ t a lot of Republicans in that district , but there are some .
All of a sudden their votes count a great deal .
â€œLogic suggests it will require a strong field organization like the one Cruz has put together , â€ � he added .
â€œTrump may start with a natural advantage in those communities , but itâ€ ™ s hard to tell whether he can put together a field organization to capitalize on that advantage in such short order.â€ �
Cruz is organized in every congressional district .
His state chairman is Ron Nehring , who spent four years as chairman of the California Republican party and ran for lieutenant governor .
By the time the San Diego County Lincoln Reagan dinner rolled around on 26 March , the Cruz campaign had already begun meeting with delegates .
Kasich tapped tech entrepreneur Steve Poizner , a former state insurance commissioner , in February to lead his California campaign .
Trump didnâ€ ™ t announce his Californian director , veteran GOP strategist Tim Clark , until 12 April â€ “ less than a month before absentee ballots are scheduled to hit the mail .
Still , Trump is leading in the polls in California and won decisively in Arizona , which has some demographic similarities with parts of southern California , and has also triumphed in liberal states such as Massachusetts .
â€œA lot of Republicans in California feel very passionately about undocumented immigration , his signature issue , â€ � John J Pitney Jr , professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College , said of Trump .
â€œThis goes all the way back to Pete Wilson and Proposition 187 in 1994.â€ �
Wilson was governor then and was a major proponent of the measure which would have banned undocumented immigrants from using state services such as public education and non - emergency healthcare .
It was approved by a hefty margin , 59 % to 41 % , but was later deemed unconstitutional .
Schnur predicts that Trump will â€œface widespread condemnationâ€ � in California , â€œbut most of those people wonâ€ ™ t be able to vote for him.â€ �
The USC Dornsife / Los Angeles Times Poll , he said , shows that â€œTrump support comes primarily from areas where Republicans have not traditionally done well , especially urban areas.â€ �"
2016-04-22,"One month after the Utah presidential caucuses , the state Republican party still has not published its final results as evidence amasses of a breakdown in the partyâ€ ™ s new online voting system as well as email and other communication failures .
The 22 March caucus , which moved the reliably red stateâ€ ™ s place in the presidential calendar up by three months , was notable for Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s lopsided victory and the firewall the establishment Republicans hoped Cruz could establish to block Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s path to the nomination .
But the caucus also offered the kind of electoral dysfunction that Trump has repeatedly characterized as a â€œrigged systemâ€ �
â€ “ a private party election without state oversight and with little transparency about either its conduct or its exact outcome .
Days after stories of different sorts of electoral dysfunction emerged from New York and Arizona , Utahâ€ ™ s Republican party appears to be in disarray , with state and local party officials pointing fingers at each other as they gear up for this weekendâ€ ™ s state convention .
As of Friday , the state partyâ€ ™ s website still linked to a results tally from 24 March showing 88.68 % of precincts reporting , with some countiesâ€ ™ counts as low as 45 % .
While these figures appear to be outdated , the state party could offer no reassurance that the vote count was in fact complete .
â€œSome people went out of town or are sick , causing a delay in getting information to us , â€ � said party spokeswoman Cindie Quintana .
â€œWe are updating as we get results.â€ � County officials with some of the lowest published tallies took vigorous exception to Quintanaâ€ ™ s characterization of the problem , blaming the delays instead on email failures and US postal service deliveries that never arrived .
By far the biggest problem to emerge has been a new online voting system that the party hoped would encourage the participation of tens of thousands of extra people , including Mormon missionaries stationed abroad .
On the eve of the election , the party told one news outlet that 59,000 had signed up to vote online .
Thereafter , party chair James Evans revised that figure down to 30,000 , then to 27,000 , acknowledging that as many as 13,000 people had tried to sign up but could not because of a variety of technical problems .
Up and down the state , voters reported being unable to obtain the 30-character personalized password needed to register to vote online .
Others were unable to enter it successfully .
â€œMy wife called tech support to get a code issued or reissued and she sat on hold for hours .
At one point , a voice came on and said , â€˜All our operators are busy , goodbyeâ€ ™ .
A lot of people had challenges , â€ � said Marc Stallings , a GOP legislative chair in St George in south - western Utah .
In response to the reported problems , the party extended the deadline for online registration by two days , leading to another potential problem , according to Marc McLemore , party chair in Garfield County in central Utah .
He said he received the list of voters earmarked for online voting before the new window for online registration had closed â€ “ raising at least the possibility that someone could vote twice , once online and again at their local precinct .
â€œThe whole thing was not well enough organized , â€ �
McLemore said .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t think the presidential voting went well at all.â€ �
The state party disregarded warnings from prominent computer scientists and from the National Institute for Standards and Technology , which oversees federal certification of voting equipment , that online voting systems are dangerously vulnerable to malware , putting both the integrity and the secrecy of the vote at risk .
On the contrary , chairman Evans put out a statement after the election touting what he called the countryâ€ ™ s â€œfirst completely online presidential electionâ€ � in which turnout had reached â€œhistorical numbersâ€ � .
No part of that statement appears to be entirely correct .
The caucus was not â€œcompletely onlineâ€ � because more than 200,000 people , according to the party , voted at their precincts , more than eight times the number said to have voted over the internet .
It was also not a first in the United States , because the Arizona Democratic party experimented with online voting in its 2000 primary , with similarly unsatisfactory results .
Limited forms of online voting have occurred since , notably in Alaska .
Turnout on 22 March was not
â€œhistoricalâ€ �
â€ “
in fact it was significantly lower than in 2008 , when Utah held primaries instead of caucuses .
The mess has led to a lot of finger - pointing and not a lot of clarity .
Smartmatic , the London - based international voting equipment company that ran the online election in Utah , distanced itself from any role in the registration process when first asked about it by the Guardian .
That part of the election , a spokesman said , had been handled by the online event site Eventbrite .
Eventbrite denied causing any problems , saying it had nothing to do with issuing passwords or other technical aspects of the election .
It had merely provided the state party with a â€œpre - RSVPâ€ � list of who wanted to participate in the caucus , and how .
â€œWe experienced no issues at any point in time with registrations for the caucuses , â€ � a company spokesperson said .
Smartmatic then revised its initial statement , saying much of the confusion arose not because of password problems but because people who had signed up with Eventbrite did not necessarily realise they needed to do anything else .
Smartmatic said 27,490 people ended up registering to vote online , and 24,486 actually voted that way .
Evans , the state GOP chair , did not respond to multiple , detailed invitations to comment .
In his public statements , he has remained upbeat about online voting and says he will recommend its reuse in 2020 .
County - level officials , by contrast , expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Smartmatic voting system .
â€œAt best , it was flawed , â€ �
McLemore , the Garfield County chair , said .
â€œIt either needs to be done away with , or fixed .
I donâ€ ™ t care which.â€ �"
2016-04-22,"The dissolution of a secretive club for Hollywood conservatives has baffled and dismayed its members , with some blaming internal divisions , including disputes over Donald Trump .
The Friends of Abe , which has hosted semi - clandestine gatherings for rightwing film - makers over the past decade , announced on Thursday that it was winding down , leaving members speculating about personal , political or financial reasons .
Tension between the groupâ€ ™ s leaders , who favor Ted Cruz for the Republican presidential nomination , and the rank and file , who appear to favor Trump , had bubbled at recent lunches dubbed â€œsteam sessionsâ€ � .
Some members on Friday cited this division as one possible factor in the announcement by the executive director , Jeremy Boreing , to wind down the groupâ€ ™ s
infrastructure â€œeffective
immediatelyâ€ � .
In an email to members â€ “ estimated to number between 1,500 and 2,500 â€ “ Boreing said the group was going to wind down its 501(c ) 3 status , end sustaining membership dues and shut down infrastructure , including the abespal.com website .
He said the group â€ “ which counts Jon Voight , Jerry Bruckheimer and Kelsey Grammer as members â€ “ had outlived its mission to connect conservatives in liberal - dominated Hollywood .
â€œToday , because we have been successful in creating a community that extends far beyond our events , people just donâ€ ™ t feel as much of a need to show up for every speaker or bar night , and fewer people pay the dues that help us maintain that large infrastructure.â€ �
However , some members said the community had fractured , and with it the Friend of Abeâ€ ™ s sense of cohesion .
â€œUnfortunately it devolved into too many high school clique - type scenarios , â€ � said Eric Porvaznik , a radio host and voiceover artist .
â€œPeople wanted to own their own little fiefdoms .
They missed the goal of like - minded people working together.â€ �
He dated the decline to the 2012 death of Andrew Breitbart , a publisher and commentator who energized conservatives , especially in Los Angeles .
â€œNo one filled that gap.â€ �
In recent months Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy opened a fresh fissure , pitting Boreing and other FOA leaders , who favour Cruz , against ordinary members at â€œsteam sessionsâ€ � and other gatherings .
Members disagreed over what extent , if any , this fuelled the dissolution .
â€œItâ€ ™ s vicious , â€ � said one , who requested anonymity .
â€œPeople will use smears , use Trumpâ€ ™ s worst quotes and pretend thatâ€ ™ s his policy .
But I donâ€ ™ t think itâ€ ™ s the reason the Friends of Abe is winding down , itâ€ ™ s not central enough.â€ �
Dave Berg , a former co - producer of the Tonight Show with Jay Leno , told the Wrap it was relevant .
â€œI think Donald Trump has everything to do with it .
I donâ€
™ t think he caused the dissolution of FOA , but relationships have definitely become more tense.â€ � Lionel Chetwynd , a producer and screenwriter and co - founder of the FOA , warned last month that the GOP primary campaign was causing a â€œcivil war in slow motionâ€ � among conservatives .
However , on Thursday he said the FOA was winding down not because of political division but because it had succeeded in linking rightwing film - makers who used to feel scattered and atomised .
â€œThey all know who they are now .
Weâ€ ™ ve introduced them .
We donâ€ ™ t need to hide any more .
We donâ€ ™ t need an organisation of this sort any more .
Weâ€ ™ ve made it clear there are thousands of conservatives who work and belong in Hollywood â€ “ that weâ€ ™
re here and weâ€ ™ re successful here.â€ �
The community was now able to network on its own , said Chetwynd .
â€œI was always of the opinion that the measure of our success would be our ultimate uselessness.â€ �
In his email to members , Boreing said the spirt of the group would endure .
â€œWe will still get together for drinks and speakers , but we may reassess how we approach those events logistically .
In short , FOA will return to its roots .
It will be a passion project , like it was in the beginning â€ ¦
Weâ€ ™ ll still be a private organization that protects the names of our members at all
costs.â€ �
Formed in 2005 , the club boasted high - profile supporters including Clint Eastwood , Gary Sinise and Patricia Heaton , who played Debra Barone in the sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond .
The group , named after Abraham Lincoln , swore members to secrecy by adopting a line from the film Fight Club : the first rule of Friends of Abe is you do not talk about Friends of Abe .
It became more widely known â€ “ and a rallying point for Republicans â€ “ when news leaked in 2014 that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating the group in connection with its application for tax - exempt status .
The IRS subsequently granted the status .
It hosted conservative luminaries such as Antonin Scalia , Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh â€ “ and , more recently , Cruz and Trump .
The conservative author and columnist Jonah Goldberg lamented its breakup on Twitter :"
2016-04-23,"Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign faced more allegations of dirty tricks after the Maine governor , Paul LePage , posted on Facebook condemning the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign as being run by â€œgreedy political hooligansâ€ � .
The fiery and controversial governor claimed on Friday that the Trump and Cruz campaigns had previously reached a â€œunity dealâ€ � to elect delegates to the national convention in proportion to results of the stateâ€ ™ s 5 March caucuses .
Such an allocation would deliver 12 Cruz delegates , nine for Trump and two for John Kasich , the Ohio governor .
However , LePage , a Trump supporter , said on the eve of Maineâ€ ™ s state convention that the Cruz campaign had reneged on the deal , believing they could fill all 20 elected delegate slots on the ballot .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t stand by and watch as Cruz and the Republican establishment forcibly overrule the votes of Mainers who chose Trump and Kasich , â€ � said LePage .
While delegates are bound on the first ballot according to the results of state primaries and caucuses , they are unbound on subsequent ballots if a contested convention occurs .
Such votes would have nothing to do with the results from the states and be solely decided by the individual delegates .
The Guardian can confirm there was discussion of a unity slate in Maine ; sources disagree on whether a deal was ever reached .
In his intervention , LePage used strikingly personal language to attack a Cruz campaign operative for â€œ[stabbing ] us in the backâ€ � .
It marks an escalation in rhetoric even as the campaign seeks to roll back Trumpâ€ ™ s aggressive language and his use of the nickname â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � for Cruz .
Earl Bierman , the state chair for the Cruz campaign , told the Guardian on Thursday night : â€œThere had been a tentative agreement for a unity slate but that was with the understanding that Cruzâ€ ™
s campaign is grassroots.â€ �
Bierman said that he had thought it was a good idea to avoid intra - party strife but grassroots Cruz supporters rebelled at the unity proposal and nixed it .
â€œThey just said no , we are not having it , they put forth their own slate , â€ � said Bierman .
Trump has attacked Cruz for months over allegations of dirty tricks on the eve of the Iowa caucuses .
The frontrunner has claimed Cruz engaged in â€œfraudâ€ � after the Cruz campaign shared a CNN story only minutes before the Iowa caucuses began that suggested Ben Carson might be dropping out .
Instead , Carson later clarified he had been going home to do laundry .
Trump also attacked Cruz for using a mailer to shame potential caucus - goers into voting by showing their turnout record along with neighborsâ€ ™ .
Although this tactic is perfectly legal and been backed by political science research , Trump has repeatedly condemned it as dishonest .
The resulting controversy is likely to cause major political turmoil in Maine .
While Cruz may have the majority of the delegates needed to elect their full slate , LePage is still the stateâ€ ™
s sitting governor and has a reputation for retaliatory behavior in state politics .
If the full Cruz slate is elected , LePage , who is running as a Trump delegate , will not be elected to represent the state he governs .
Both campaigns have sent top surrogates to the state , with former presidential candidates Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina appearing on behalf of Trump and Cruz respectively .
It represents the next front in the ongoing complex battle to fill delegate slots and prepare for a contested convention .
Bierman said he was confused about why LePage was â€œcrying foulâ€ � , noting that in a proxy contest for RNC national committeeman , he himself had lost to state representative Alex Willette , a Trump supporter and close ally of LePage .
Based on that result , the Trump campaign should be well placed to elect delegates at the state convention .
Bierman also pushed back at LePageâ€ ™ s attack on the Cruz campaign staffer , whom he described as honorable .
He noted the national campaign had no involvement in any discussions on a unity deal .
The Cruz campaign is â€œnot telling grassroots in Maine what they can or canâ€ ™ t doâ€ � , said Bierman .
Instead the grassroots supporters were giving the Cruz campaign marching orders .
So far , Cruz , whose campaign has long focused on delegate hunting has been at a distinct advantage over Trump .
The frontrunner has only beefed up his delegate outreach in the past six weeks , bringing over a number of former operatives from the Carson campaign , led by the veteran strategist Ed Brookover as well as the longtime Republican insider Paul Manafort ."
2016-04-24,"Republican superdonor Charles Koch shared scathing views on Sunday of the top two candidates in the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominating race , saying Donald Trump and Ted Cruz had presented policy proposals that were â€œreminiscent of Nazi Germanyâ€ � , â€œmonstrousâ€ � and â€œfrighteningâ€ � .
In an interview with ABC News , Koch , the libertarian billionaire head â€ “ with his brother , David â€ “ of vast energy and manufacturing interests , was asked about a Trump proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US .
Koch replied that a corollary Trump suggestion , to create databases of Muslims , was worse .
â€œWhat was worse was this : â€˜Weâ€ ™ ll have them all register.â€ ™
Thatâ€ ™ s reminiscent of Nazi Germany , â€ � said Koch .
â€œI
mean , thatâ€ ™ s monstrous.â€
�
Koch held a slightly less dim view of a Cruz promise to carpet - bomb areas of the Middle East under Isis control .
â€œWell , thatâ€ ™ s got ta be hyperbole , but , I mean , that a candidate , whether they believe it or not , would think that appeals to the American people?â€ �
Koch said .
â€œThis is frightening.â€ �
The Koch brothers have spent untold millions over decades of efforts to reshape municipal and state governments , elect Republicans to congress , enact voter ID laws , combat gun control and discourage government regulation of all kinds .
Early in the 2016 election cycle , David Koch predicted that Scott Walker , the governor of Wisconsin , would be the Republican nominee .
The brothers backed Walkerâ€ ™ s campaign , which did not survive 2015 .
Koch on Sunday said that he and David were displeased with the tenor of the Republican race this year , to the extent that he suggested , perhaps facetiously , that they might even support the Democratic nominee - in - waiting , Hillary Clinton .
â€œWe would have to believe her actions would be quite different than her rhetoric ,
â€ � Koch said .
â€œBut on some of the Republican candidates we would â€ “ before we could support them , weâ€ ™ d have to believe their actions will be quite different than the rhetoric weâ€ ™ ve heard so far.â€ �
Koch said he could imagine Clinton as a preferable president over Trump or Cruz .
â€œLet me put it that way , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s possible.â€
�
However , Clinton tweeted her rejection of any apparent support from that quarter : The Koch brothers , who once vowed to spend nearly $ 1bn in the 2016 election cycle , were not actively spending money against Trump , he said .
â€œWe read â€
“
I read , oh
, weâ€ ™ ve given millions to this one , millions to that one , and millions to oppose Trump , â€ � he said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve done none of that .
We havenâ€ ™ t put a penny in any of these campaigns , pro or con.â€ �
He added , though , that he did not foresee a way of supporting Trump or Cruz .
â€œThese personal attacks and pitting one person against the other â€ “
thatâ€
™ s the message youâ€ ™ re sending the country , â€ � he said .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re role models and youâ€ ™ re terrible role models .
So how â€ “ I donâ€ ™
t know how we could support â€ ™ em.â€ �"
2016-04-25,"In nearly simultaneous statements Sunday night , Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced plans to coordinate their campaigns to play to each otherâ€ ™ s regional strengths and , hopefully , deny Donald Trump enough delegates to become a first - ballot nominee .
This bold plan takes us from a status quo where Trump might reach the 1,237 delegates required to become the Republican party nominee , with his opponents mathematically eliminated , to one in which Trump might reach the 1,237 delegates required , with his opponents still mathematically eliminated .
The most Cruz and Kasichâ€ ™ s plan can do is wreck the Republican party .
The GOP reflexively blames Washington gridlock and electoral failure on co - opted candidates and the perversions of the political process thwarting the will of the people .
Meanwhile , Donald Trump has spent the last two weeks successfully castigating the Republican delegate process as a rigged game .
His opponentsâ€ ™ brightest idea was to jointly announce their plans to rig it even more .
That is a kind of plan .
Then again , so is burning down your house to collect the insurance money .
Hereâ€ ™ s the strategy : Cruz will focus on friendly territory in Indiana , while the â€œmoderateâ€ � Kasich focuses on friendly territory in Oregon and New Mexico .
How the rest of the states get divvied up is anyoneâ€ ™ s guess , as is how much money Kasich will have on hand for the states heâ€ ™ s supposed to lure away from media - saturated Trumpism .
This is a political superhero team assembled out of a kill - priced remainder bin of bad ideas .
There hasnâ€ ™ t been a sadder or less formidable duo since the Wonder Twins on the old Super Friends cartoon â€ “ two kids from another planet whose superpowers involved one turning into forms of water and the other turning into shapes of animals .
Only in this case you have John Kasich , who takes the form of a perpetually peevish dad who looks like the only thing he wants to say at a podium is , Hey , kids , quit playinâ€ ™ grab - ass and take a knee , before â€œmoderatelyâ€ � suggesting we start the third world war in the Middle East .
His partner , Cruz , takes the shape of whatever the guy from Duck Dynasty thinks is most likely to prevent a Muslim apocalypse and start the Christian one .
But theyâ€ ™ re both serving an establishment attempting to salvage a party that has spent years fomenting resentment against elites and Washington insiders .
Kasich touts his Ohio mailing address , but he also brags about his 1990s role negotiating budgets in the House , where he was a ranking committee member .
After Congress , he became a managing director at Lehman Brothers , which stopped existing after it broke itself and the world .
He also took the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in Ohio .
And despite Cruzâ€ ™ s insurgent antics , remember that this is an Ivy League - educated former US supreme court clerk who worked in the Bush administration and who decamped for a top - flight law firm before partially funding his Senate campaign with loans from Goldman Sachs .
Ted Cruz can refuse to play nice in Congress all he wants , but railing against ivory towers falls apart when you studied at two of them and work in a third .
As for the everyman touch , well , if you like â€œdadbodâ€ � as a concept , you could vote for Kasich .
On the other hand , outside of very fundamentalist audiences , Ted Cruz comes off like a Martian whose sleeper - agent research on humanity was conducted by watching six hours of The Junior Christian Science Bible Lesson on public access TV .
Whatever these two hope to accomplish is doomed .
Kasich will enter the Republican national convention a distant third , and Cruz will come in second .
Both will then have to argue that they have some right to ignore the desires of everyone who voted for the first - place candidate .
That is not a plan .
At best , itâ€ ™ s a plan to have another plan later , with the hope that somehow events between now and then will recast snookering the majority of Republican primary voters as a noble act ."
2016-04-25,"Ted Cruz and John Kasich have announced that their campaigns will cede certain states in an attempt to keep Donald Trump from reaching the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the Republican nomination .
In a pair of coordinated statements released on Sunday night , the Cruz and Kasich campaigns said that the Texas senator would concentrate his resources in Indiana while the Ohio governor would focus on Oregon and New Mexico instead .
Both have already stated that they expect there to be a contested convention in Cleveland in July and are already preparing for a second ballot .
However , for that scenario to come to pass , they first need to stop Trump .
This apparent agreement seems to be an admission that only way to do so is for his opponents to finally cooperate against him .
Under current rules , delegates are only bound by the results of their stateâ€ ™ s primary or caucus for the first ballot .
On any subsequent ballot , delegates are free to vote their conscience and , since delegate selection is often an entirely separate process from a primary , there is likely to be a significant shift in votes on a second ballot .
Jeff Roe , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign manager , went first .
He wrote : â€œOur campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico , and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.â€ �
Cruz has already shifted resources to focus entirely on Indiana , whose 30 winner - take - all statewide delegates represent the biggest individual haul remaining .
The state , which holds its primary on 3 May , also allocates three delegates to the winner of each of its nine congressional districts .
Polls in the Hoosier State had Trump with a narrow lead ahead of Cruz with Kasich lagging behind .
One campaign source indicated that internal polls showed Kasich was dividing the anti - Trump vote in Indiana and serving as a major hindrance to Cruzâ€ ™ s prospects .
Further , a Trump win in Indiana would make it far more likely that the real estate mogul would win the 1237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot .
The Cruz statement was followed minutes later by a statement from Kasich strategist John Weaver .
The veteran operative wrote : â€œDue to the fact that the Indiana primary is winner - take - all statewide and by congressional district , keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland .
We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already , and given the current dynamics of the primary there , we will shift our campaignâ€ ™ s resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.â€ �
Weaver added that â€œin turn , we will focus our time and resources in New Mexico and Oregon , both areas that are structurally similar to the north - east politically , where Governor Kasich is performing well .
We would expect independent third - party groups to do the same and honor the commitments made by the Cruz and Kasich campaigns.â€ �
Although the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment , the candidate reacted in a late night tweet : Trump later issued a follow - up statement in which he accused Cruz and Kasich of â€œcollusionâ€ � and said : â€œIt is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person who has only been a politician for 10 months in order to try and stop that person from getting the Republican nomination.â€ �
The pact already has seen some signs of fragility .
When asked about it over a breakfast of berries in a Pennsylvania diner on Monday , Kasich said of Indiana Republicans : â€œThey ought to vote for me.â€ �
The Ohio governor insisted that the plan was all about resource allocation .
Cruz , at a press conference , dismissed questions of â€œcollusionâ€ � and instead simply described the deal as â€œan allocation of resources that makes a lot of senseâ€ � .
The agreement comes just days after Cruz suggested in Florida that Kasich was only staying in the presidential race because â€œit may be John is auditioning to be Donaldâ€ ™ s vice presidentâ€ � .
The Texas senator also said earlier on Sunday that the Ohio governor did not have â€œa plausible pathâ€ � to the nomination .
Tim Miller , a spokesman for Our Principles PAC , an anti - Trump superPAC , said he found the apparent alliance â€œencouragingâ€ � , when asked for comment via e - mail .
He added : â€œSee you in Cleveland.â€ � Oregon , which holds its primary on 17 May , and New Mexico , which votes on 7 June , each have relatively proportional primaries .
Oregon allocates its 28 delegates in purely proportional manner while New Mexico has a threshold that requires a candidate to get 15 % of the vote .
The result is that these states are far less important on the first ballot than winner - take - all Indiana and seemingly give Kasich the short end of the stick in this deal .
However , with almost all delegates unbound after that point , the hope in the Ohio governorâ€ ™ s campaign is that they can flip a number of delegates on a potential second ballot .
Despite the deal in these states , both campaigns made it clear that they would compete against each other in all of the remaining primary contests .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign chief said : â€œIn other states holding their elections for the remainder of the primary season , our campaign will continue to compete vigorously to win.â€ �
Past attempts for Republican candidates to make anti - Trump deals had petered out .
Kasich squelched an overture from Marco Rubio to engage in strategic voting in their home - state primaries on 15 March .
While a Rubio spokesman urged supporters of the Florida senator to vote for Kasich in the Ohio , the Kasich campaign declined to return the favor in Florida .
As long ago as last September , when Scott Walker dropped out of the presidential race , he did so in attempt to consolidate the field to stop Trump .
The deal between the two campaigns came 36 hours before the opening of polls in the so - called Acela Primary , comprising five states in the northeast and mid - Atlantic .
Trump is expected to dominate in these states and both Cruz and Kasich are likely to be shut out in the bound - delegate chase in at least three of the states holding contests on Tuesday .
However , because 54 of the 71 delegates elected in Pennsylvania will be unbound and free to vote for any candidate , Trumpâ€ ™ s rivals could still gain there ."
2016-04-25,"One of the conservative billionaire brothers , who spent almost $ 400 m for Republicans in 2012 , said Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s ideas are â€œreminiscent of Nazi Germanyâ€ � and â€œitâ€ ™ s
possibleâ€ � a Democrat would be better .
â€œThis is frighteningâ€ � Ted Cruz and John Kasich agreed to cede certain states to the other in a plan to prevent Trump from reaching the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the Republican nomination .
Too little too late ?
But cracks in the alliance appeared :
Kasich said he still wants votes in states where Cruz could beat Trump .
â€œThey ought to vote for me , â€ � he said over breakfast .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not
a big deal.â€ �
Cruz :
Trump will cry and whine Donald is a sore loser â€ ¦
He would much rather hide in Trump Tower .
Heâ€ ™ d much rather stay in Northeastern states that tend to be more liberal than actually come to the midwest , come to the heartland .
â€ “
Ted Cruz Democratic underdog Bernie Sanders explained his losses in some states by saying â€œpoor people donâ€ ™ t voteâ€ � , and started talking about ambitions to redefine liberal politics for years to come .
â€œA sad realityâ€ �
Before five east coast states vote on Tuesday Hillary Clinton toured Delaware , where Senator Tom Carper , a supporter , sang â€œshe works hard for the moneyâ€ � for her .
The east gets excited"
2016-04-26,"Donald Trump has decried â€œcollusionâ€ � between his Republican rivals to deny him victory in upcoming primary contests as five more states prepared to vote for their preferred presidential candidate .
Trump fumed over the alliance between John Kasich and Ted Cruz to cede upcoming states to each other in the hope that they can stop the frontrunner winning enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination outright .
Trump attacked Kasich and Cruz as â€œtruly weakâ€ � over the strategy whereby Cruz , a Texas senator , will concentrate his resources in Indiana while Kasich , the Ohio governor , will focus on Oregon and New Mexico instead .
â€œCollusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive ,
â€ � he said .
â€œThey are mathematically dead and this act only shows , as puppets of donors and special interests , how truly weak they and their campaigns are.â€ � Republicans fearing Trump is on a roll to becoming the partyâ€ ™ s presidential candidate are pinning their homes on a â€œcontested conventionâ€ � where no clear winner emerges in the first round of voting by delegates at their national conference in July .
In any subsequent rounds of voting at the conference , Trumpâ€ ™ s delegates would be free to vote for someone else .
The tit - for - tat continued on Monday , with Cruz declaring Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign part of the â€œWashington cartelâ€
� despite the frontrunner framing himself as anti - establishment .
â€œThe entire Trump campaign is run by Washington lobbyists , itâ€ ™ s the Washington cartel .
Donald Trump is the system , â€ � Cruz said .
Trump then lashed out on Twitter against John Kasich saying that people should still back him in Indiana â€ “ even though he is not campaigning there as part of his alliance with Cruz .
However , Kasichâ€ ™ s adviser John Weaver noted that the plan wasnâ€ ™ t to endorse each other in those states , but instead focus their campaigning .
Trump railed against a â€œtotally riggedâ€ � nomination system where two candidates with â€œno pathâ€ � to victory could seek to deny him the nomination .
â€œI have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich .
Additionally , I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60 % of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me .
â€œBecause of me , everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged.â€ � Ted Cruz , speaking in Borden , Indiana , made no apology for lining up with Kasich to stymie their mutual rival .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t doubt that Donald Trump will scream and yell and curse and insult and probably cry and whine some as well , â€ � Cruz said .
Talking Points Memo reported the Texas senator as adding : â€œDonald is a sore loser .
When he lost five states in a row in landslide elections , Donald threw a tantrum â€ ¦ â€œHis response is to attack the voters .
His response is to attack the people .
Yes , I get that the Trump campaign is scared .
Theyâ€ ™ re scared of Indiana .
If Donald wasnâ€ ™ t scared , heâ€ ™ d show up in Indiana and have a debate .
But he would much rather hide in Trump Tower.â€
�
On Tuesday a five - state marathon known as the â€œAcela primaryâ€ � will take place in Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Rhode Island , Maryland and Delaware .
Trump and the Democratic frontrunner , Hillary Clinton , are expected to win the lionâ€ ™ s share of the delegates up for grabs .
On the Democratic side , Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ s campaign chief vowed the candidate would stay in the Democratic race until the summer convention , even as Clinton looks to lock down her commanding position in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s contests .
Clinton has the chance of a clean sweep or at least multiple victories that would probably foreclose Sandersâ€ ™ s already narrow path to the nomination .
But the Vermont senatorâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Jeff Weaver , said the millions of dollars flowing to Sanders and the boisterous rallies showed his â€œsupporters will stand with us all the way to the endâ€ � .
Both Democrats spent Monday campaigning on the east coast .
Clinton looked beyond her rivalry with Sanders and went after Trump as a man out of touch on wages , climate change , national security and the lives of everyday people .
â€œCome out of those towers named after yourself and actually talk and listen to people , â€ �
Clinton told a Delaware crowd , as if talking to him .
â€œDonâ€
™ t just fly that big jet in and land it and go make a big speech and insult everybody you can think of and then go back in on that big jet and go back to your country club house in Florida or your penthouse in New York.â€
�
She was addressing more than 900 people in a Wilmington theatre .
At a Hartford rally with more than 1,800 people , Sanders drew distinctions with Clinton on the minimum wage , his call for a carbon tax to address climate change , fracking and more .
â€œWe can not afford to poison our water , â€ � he said .
â€œSecretary Clinton does not agree .
In fact , as secretary of state she pushed fracking on countries all over the world.â€ �
Sanders said he would phase out fracking as president .
With the Associated Press"
2016-04-26,"As presidential nominees Ted Cruz and Donald Trump , respectively , call climate change a â€œreligionâ€ � or a â€œbullshit â€ ¦
total hoaxâ€
� dreamed up by China
, it is deeply unfashionable for any Republican to take the issue seriously , let alone push for radical reforms to remedy it .
Kevin Faulconer , the mayor of San Diego , could therefore qualify as one of the most outlandish , as well as green - tinged , Republicans in the US .
Faulconer has thrown his weight behind a binding plan to make San Diego run on 100 % renewable power by 2035 â€ “ the largest American city to have such an ambition .
Faulconer is as much a product of his largely liberal surrounds as he is of his party , of course .
The 49-year - old mayor will march for LGBT pride and supports a path to US citizenship for undocumented immigrants .
But San Diegoâ€ ™ s
bipartisan push to embrace clean energy such as solar and wind , while radically paring back greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % by 2050 , is a glimpse into how the rancorous brawls over climate change could have been avoided across the rest of the US .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t a partisan issue , â€ � Faulconer told the Guardian .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve said from the very beginning thereâ€ ™ s enough partisan politics at the national level .
I was a volunteer for our parks before becoming mayor ; I love our natural resources , our beaches and landscapes .
I feel strongly about protecting them.â€ �
While Republicans , including Florida senator Marco Rubio , have warned any action to cut emissions will raise power bills and lead to economic ruin , Faulconer has sold a vision of low - carbon innovation , jobs and clean air .
San Diegoâ€ ™ s business community is now on board , although Faulconer admitted it took â€œa lot of persuasionâ€ � .
â€œI pride myself on being fiscally responsible and environmentally conscious
, â€ � he said .
â€œThe two arenâ€ ™ t exclusive .
Iâ€ ™ ve never seen it as a zero sum game .
We want a plan that is ambitious and leads the way for the rest of the country.â€ �
A plan endorsed unanimously by San Diegoâ€ ™ s Democrat - dominated council in December would see Americaâ€ ™ s eighth largest city transformed into one riddled by bicycles and public transport , with roofs swathed in solar panels .
The city will switch half its fleet of vehicles to electric power , and almost all the methane from sewage and water treatment will be recycled .
A key selling point for the plan is the resulting jobs and investment in clean energy â€ “ San Diego ranks second in the US in electrical output from solar energy , and the city is openly courting clean tech firms to set up shop there .
It already derives 40 % of its power from clean sources .
But public concern about climate change is also a key driver .
â€œPeople have seen and felt the drought , the wildfires , the flooding , â€ � said Nicole Capretz , who wrote the first iteration of the climate plan before the controversial exit of previous mayor Bob Filner .
â€œPeople were witnessing a lot of things in their backyard .
When you see your quality of life is at risk , people start to wake up and say â€˜itâ€ ™ s time.â€ ™ â€ � â€œThe beautiful part about having a Republican mayor embrace this plan , â€ �
she added , â€œis that he did outreach to his own friends and factions and persuaded them it was the right thing to do for economic reasons.â€
�
There remain hurdles for San Diego to clear .
An implementation plan has yet to be finalized but much will rest upon an intervention into the electricity market .
San Diegoâ€ ™ s utility has said it can not meet the 100 % renewable goal itself , meaning that the city will have to branch out to source its power elsewhere while the utility retains control over poles and wires .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a battle brewing on that , â€ � Capretz admitted .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the largest part of the climate plan â€ “
we canâ€
™ t get to the goal without it.â€
�
On the plus side , the 2035 decarbonization plan is legally binding , unlike the aspirations of other large cities .
And some measures should be straightforward to achieve , such as an initiative to increase San Diegoâ€ ™ s tree canopy cover to 35 % , which would soak up carbon and help cool the city with more shade .
Improvements to train and bike infrastructure should also prove popular , but a price tag has yet to be put on this .
Itâ€ ™ s likely that help from Californian or federal coffers will be required .
Regardless of whether the target is met , San Diego is among a large group of cities impatient with federal government bickering over climate change .
Municipalities from New York to San Francisco have goals to either majorly or completely switch to renewable energy , while Michael Bloomberg , the former New York mayor , has spearheaded an international coalition of mayors that is looking to wean urban areas off fossil fuels .
While a record number of nations have signed up to cut emissions , there is still a significant gap between their pledged action and what is required to avoid the worst ravages of climate change , such as drought , extreme weather events and sea level rise .
Faulconer said this shortfall can be plugged , in part , by cities taking the lead .
â€œCities are leading the federal government , yes , â€ � he said .
â€œThey are leading on innovation and policy .
The technology is advancing incredibly quickly .
We need to have our eyes wide open on this.â€ �"
2016-04-27,"Ted Cruz unveiled former business executive Carly Fiorina as his running mate on Wednesday .
Cruz told a crowd of hundreds of supporters : â€œAfter a great deal of time and thought , after a great deal of consideration and prayer , I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated , I will run on a ticket with my vice - presidential nominee Carly Fiorina.â€
�
The move comes as an attempt to shift the national conversation the day after Trumpâ€ ™ s overwhelming win in the Republican primary in five east coast states and only six days before Indianaâ€ ™ s crucial primary , which awards the statewide winner 30 delegates , the largest single pot available until June .
Fiorina took the stage to loud cheers and country music , telling the crowd : â€œToday I am very proud and very humbled and honored to announce that I have accepted Senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s
offer.â€ �
She went on to describe the Republican nominating process as â€œa fight for the soul of our party and the future of our nominationâ€ � and pledged that she is â€œ prepared to stand by [ Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s ] side and give this everything that I have to defeat Donald Trump , restore the soul of this party and take our country backâ€ � .
The newly minted vice - presidential candidate has been an active surrogate for Cruz since endorsing him in early March .
The former Hewlett - Packard CEO has barnstormed across the country on behalf of the Texas senator since then .
Cruz has often praised Fiorina on the stump and saying that the former CEO gives â€œHillary Clinton nightmares .
I can just picture Hillary thinking about Carly and tossing and turning and tossing and turning in her jail cell.â€
�
Fiorina has since grown close to the Cruz family and even sang a song for Cruzâ€ ™ s young daughters from the stage on Wednesday .
Although it was widely reported that the Cruz campaign was vetting potential vice - presidential candidates , and a Fiorina aide confirmed to the Guardian that she was participating in the vetting process , the announcement of a running mate by a candidate who still has yet to clinch the nomination is historic .
The last candidate to do so was Ronald Reagan on the eve of the 1976 Republican national convention .
Reagan tapped Pennsylvania senator Richard Schweiker in an unsuccessful attempt to oust the incumbent president , Gerald Ford .
While itâ€ ™ s widely considered that Reagan made a mistake in naming the liberal Republican to be his running mate , Cruz refused to condemn the move in a December interview with the Guardian .
â€œOh , look , one could go back and second - guess decisions that are difficult decisions to make , â€ � said Cruz of Reaganâ€ ™ s failed attempt to unite the Republican party .
Cruz acknowledged that announcing a vice - presidential selection this early was â€œunusualâ€ � , but he pointed out that â€œthis race is , if anything , unusual.â€ �
The Texas senator said the announcement was so the voters will know what you will get and give the American people â€œa clear choiceâ€
� .
He contrasted this with Trump , whom he described as â€œa New York liberalâ€ � who constantly shifted positions .
Fiorina , who dropped out of the presidential race in February after poor results in Iowa and New Hampshire , would be the first vice - president in history to have not held public office .
A former CEO of Hewlett - Packard whose reign was marked by controversy after the printer companyâ€ ™ s failed acquisition of Compaq , Fiorina previously mounted a losing Senate campaign in California in 2010 against Democrat Barbara Boxer .
Fiorinaâ€ ™ s selection could help boast Cruzâ€ ™ s appeal among female voters in the remaining Republican primaries .
Trump has consistently done better with men than women in exit polls and Fiorina could help reinforce this gender gap .
In a rally in Indianapolis , Trump dismissed Cruzâ€ ™ s announcement as inconsequential .
â€œCruz canâ€ ™ t win .
Whatâ€ ™ s he doing picking a vice - president?â€ �
Trump asked .
The frontrunner went on to claim that the Texas senator was the â€œfirst presidential candidate in history of this country who is mathematically eliminated from becoming president who has chosen a vice - president .
I wish him well
but they are not going to do it for you.â€
�
Vice - presidential nominees have traditionally been attack dogs to allow presidential candidates to keep their hands clean .
However , that script was reversed on Wednesday as Fiorina repeatedly referenced God , the constitution and the founding fathers while Cruz bashed Trump as â€œa no - good scoundrelâ€ � and â€œa big government New York liberal , who is a Washington insider , who agrees with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obamaâ€ � .
Trump and Fiorina have a long history of conflict .
The Republican frontrunner mocked her appearance in a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone , saying : â€œLook at that face .
Would anyone vote for that?â€ � Cruz though praised Fiorinaâ€ ™ s response to these attacks on Wednesday .
â€œAt one of the earliest debates , Carly confronted Donald Trump , a man who in his characteristic understatement said of her , â€˜look at that faceâ€ ™ and every one of us remembers the grace , the class , the elan with which Carly responded .
Responded to Donald Trump that she knew exactly was saying and every woman in america knew exactly what Donald was saying.â€ �
Trump was slightly more charitable to Fiorina in a phone interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday , describing her as â€œa nice person â€
“
but she never resonatedâ€ � .
He added : â€œBy the end she was an insignificant player.â€
�
In a statement to the Guardian on Fiorinaâ€ ™ s selection , Trump did not mention her by name , and he dismissed choosing her as a desperate move by the Cruz campaign .
â€œAfter massive defeats in Arizona , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Delaware , Connecticut and Maryland ( in addition to 20 other contests ) , and given the fact that Senator Cruz has millions of votes less than me and is being clobbered on the delegate front , this is a pure waste of time , â€ � said Trump .
He added in a reference to a pact between Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich to divide up the forthcoming Indiana , New Mexico and Oregon primaries : â€œIt reminds me very much of the already failed Kasich â€˜collusionâ€ ™ â€ “ a desperate attempt to save a failing campaign by an all talk , no action politician .
â€œThe people of Indiana are very smart â€ “ they will see through this just like they saw through the already failed Kasich alliance .
Cruz has no path to victory â€ “ he is only trying to stay
relevant.â€ �
Trumpâ€ ™ s policy adviser Stephen Miller was more direct about Fiorina at a rally just five miles away and two hours after she was announced as Cruzâ€ ™ s running mate .
Miller described Cruzâ€ ™ s selection as â€œone of the weirder events that weâ€ ™ ve ever seen in American political historyâ€ � and said Fiorina is â€œthe outsourcer - in - chiefâ€ � .
After saying Cruz sided with China over the US , the Trump aide said Cruz and Fiorina â€œare now officially the outsourcing ticketâ€ � ."
2016-04-27,"Ted Cruz dropped a news bomb that cynics said was meant to draw attention from Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s crushing Tuesday wins : Cruz has chosen former tech CEO Carly Fiorina as his running mate .
Cruz to name Fiorina Fiorina ended her own bid for the presidential nomination after finishing seventh in New Hampshire â€ “ but not before showing she could slug Trump for his attacks on women and more .
One twist for Ted : he is a long way from winning the GOP presidential nomination .
Is it a case of cart before horse ?
Ronald Reagan tried out the same strategy in 1976 â€ “ and failed .
Indiana win could propel Trump to victory Trump released a statement calling the announcement a â€œpure waste of timeâ€ � and â€œa desperate attempt to save a failing campaign.â€ �
Trump called for a â€œnew rational American foreign policyâ€ � in a Washington speech for which he used a Teleprompter , which made him sound â€

Newt Gingrich and Ann Coulter loved the speech .

Trump could end up being least popular nominee ever among women
The people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be .
Thatâ€ ™ s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast .
â€ “ Bernie Sanders , after big losses on Tuesday"
2016-04-27,"Donald Trump has taken another giant stride towards the Republican nomination with a clean sweep of victories in the five states up for grabs in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primary elections .
The billionaire businessman appeared to have fully regained the momentum against rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich as he claimed all of the north - eastern states of the â€œAcela primaryâ€ � , named after the rail line which links them .
The Associated Press called the first three races â€ “ Pennsylvania , Maryland and Connecticut â€ “ for Trump moments after polls closed at 8 pm .
Trump had a 36-point lead over Cruz in Pennsylvania with one - third of votes counted , with a 33-point margin in Connecticut and a 31-point lead in Maryland .
By 8.34pm , Rhode Island and Delaware had been added to the wins column for the property magnate , with winning margins in excess of 40 points .
Trump hailed what he said was his biggest night of the race and although he is still quite likely to fall short of the finish line , he said : â€œI consider myself the presumptive nominee ... as far as I am concerned , itâ€ ™ s over.â€ � Speaking at Trump Tower in New York City , he predicted big nights ahead in the key states of Indiana and California and also began looking forward to the general election in November , claiming : â€œWe will beat Hillary so easily.â€ �
But despite notching up more delegates and dominating the media agenda , Trumpâ€ ™ s ultimate claim on the nomination remains far from certain and leaves little room for error .
The final winning margins will be crucial in deciding whether he can reach the 1,237 delegates needed before the Republican convention in July .
Trump has already criticised the system in Pennsylvania , where the Republican winner is awarded 17 delegates , but 54 other delegates will be unbound and free to vote for any candidate at the convention .
â€œItâ€ ™ s crazy ,
â€ �
he said of the voting rules .
â€œThe system is so complicated.â€ � Opinion polls had shown Trump leading in all five states â€ “ and his last remaining rivals had already moved on to later states where they desperately hoped to halt his advance .
Laura Seyler , a Republican in Pennsylvania , cast her vote for him , saying she believed he would â€œtake the bat and straighten things outâ€ � .
She told the AP :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t think
heâ€
™ s afraid , he doesnâ€ ™ t owe anybody anything , and I think heâ€
™ s very much an American that loves his country , and he sees Americans suffering.â€ � Exit polls showed Trump dominating among almost every demographic in the north - east and continuing his trend of overwhelming leads among poorer and older voters in the Republican primary .
Kasich , though , essentially tied with Trump in Maryland among voters with graduate degrees .
But as the endgame draws near , attention is already turning to Indianaâ€ ™ s primary next week .
The Hoosier State has long been considered one of the key battlegrounds for anti - Trump forces , as the statewide winner receives 30 delegates , the biggest single pot of delegates before June .
In attempt to stop Trump , Texas senator Cruz formed a pact with Kasich , according to which the Ohio governor , who is currently polling in third place in Indiana , will devote no further resources to the state .
The goal of their pact is to stop Trump from winning a majority of delegates , with the ambition of forcing a second ballot at the July convention in Cleveland , Ohio .
At that point , delegates would be free to vote for other candidates and the Kasich campaign calculates that it would pick up the support of a number of Indiana delegates once they are no longer obligated by next weekâ€ ™ s primary result .
Cruz was quick to pull out of campaigning in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primaries and focus all his energy on Indiana .
In contrast , Kasich spent time hoping to pick up delegates in states such as Rhode Island , and in several congressional districts in Maryland that border Washington DC .
Trump has dismissed his rivalsâ€ ™ strategy as â€œpatheticâ€ � and the latest example of what he describes as a rigged political system .
The former candidate Ben Carson , now a Trump supporter , added on Fox News : â€œThe people have sort of risen up and theyâ€ ™ ve said we donâ€ ™ t want all this stuff that is going on , all this intricate , backroom stuff.â€ �
Speaking before polls closed in the five states voting on Tuesday , Cruz took the stage in the gym where the underdog sports movie Hoosiers was filmed to criticise both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as peas in the establishment pod .
The Texas senator pre - emptively conceded , saying â€œtonight Donald Trump is expected to have a good nightâ€ � , but expressed his hope that the race was moving on to â€œmore favorable terrainâ€ � with the Hoosier Stateâ€ ™ s primary next week .
Cruz went on to try to tie his top Republican rival to the likely Democratic nominee .
He jibed that Clinton might pick Trump as a running mate because they were both New York liberals who agreed on 13 listed policy issues , including that â€œgrown men should use the little girlsâ€ ™ restroomâ€ � , a reference to the controversial HB2 measure recently passed in North Carolina , which overturns local laws banning discrimination against transgender individuals .
Cruz , though , embraced what he saw as his current role as the underdog in the race , even having his bodyman re - enact a scene from Hoosiers to demonstrate the basket was the same height in Indiana as it was in New York City .
This was a reference to a scene in which the underdog high school coach , played by Gene Hackman , inspires his team to victory on the eve of a game against a heavily favored opponent .
The wider Republican intrigue , as Cruz and Kasich plot to foil Trump , is matched by drama within the Trump campaign .
As the frontrunner has edged closer to the nomination , the introduction of veteran Washington operative Paul Manafort to his inner circle has triggered a civil war within his camp .
Manafort , who has brought in a number of other seasoned Washington operatives , has pushed Trump to be a more traditional candidate who makes fewer controversial remarks and runs a campaign that features extensive television advertising and polling .
In contrast , longtime campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has pushed to â€œlet Trump be Trump.â€ �
The resulting conflict between the two for the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s ear has seen Trump schedule a foreign policy speech one day and make fun of how Kasich eats the next .
Trump was due to make that speech in Washington on Wednesday as he tries to show the wider world that he can discuss foreign policy in fully formed paragraphs ."
2016-04-28,"Did one of your former colleagues compare you to the Prince of Darkness and tell the world that you are the least agreeable â€œson of a bitchâ€ � that theyâ€ ™ d ever had the misfortune of working with ?
No ?
Then you had a better day than Texas senator Ted Cruz , who was put on blast in a speech former House speaker John Boehner gave to college students that was equal parts fire and brimstone .
â€œLucifer in the flesh , â€ �
Boehner told an audience at Stanford University last night , according to the Stanford Daily .
â€œI have Democrat friends and Republican friends .
I get along with almost everyone , but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.â€ �
In a week when we thought nothing could get more bizarre than vice presidential would - be Carly Fiorina bursting into song , today was really a feat of political imagination .
Hereâ€ ™ s a quick rundown of the biggest news from the campaign trail today :
After Boehnerâ€ ™ s â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � comments ( sidenote : Weâ€ ™ re going to start giving this review about normal stuff and people : â€œHow was
brunch?â€ � â€œIt was Lucifer in the flesh .
A miserable son of a bitch.â€ � ) the Texas senator distanced himself from the former House speaker , telling reporters in a news conference in Fort Wayne , Indiana , that he had only met Boehner a handful of times .
â€œHe allowed his inner Trump to come out , â€ � Cruz added .
Speak of the Devil and he doth appear : Donald Trump lucked out with todayâ€ ™ s Luciferian news cycle , and picked up the endorsement of House transportation committee chair Bill Shuster to boot .
Throw in the resigned endorsement of former Mitt Romney aide Ron Kaufman - who compared Trump to Ronald Reagan - and heâ€ ™ s got himself a party .
While Trump is making nice with members of Congress and the Republican establishment , it seems like his two opponents for the Republican nomination canâ€ ™ t even go 24 hours without betraying one another . .
A short few days after a strategic alignment between Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich implied that the two would work together to deny Trump the nomination , and Cruz is already backing down from the deal .
â€œI recognize that the media is all eager to talk about an alliance , â€ �
Cruz said in the same press conference .
â€œThere is no alliance.â€ � Cut to John Weaver , a senior adviser to Kasich , tweeting this : What could that be about ?
As for the Democrats , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton unveiled a literal â€œWoman Cardâ€ � for her supporters , piggybacking on remarks made by Trump that she has characterized as sexist .
( The cards are modeled after New York Cityâ€ ™ s MetroCards , but hopefully swipe easier . )
Meanwhile , with his hopes of winning the Democratic nomination fading , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is hoping to make his mark on the Democratic party in another way - by reshaping the nomination process to allow non - Democrats to have their say .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for news from the campaign trail - tune in tomorrow for more up - to - the - second updates from the campaign .

The film , Southside with You , is a romantic dramedy and focuses on the coupleâ€ ™ s first date in 1989 , which featured a trip to the Art Institute of Chicago , a viewing of Spike Leeâ€ ™ s
Do The Right Thing and their first kiss outside an ice cream parlor .
The film premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and has received positive reviews .
The film is scheduled to be released on August 26 .
Gloom and doom is the attitude of the day over at the newly minted Cruz / Fiorina campaign headquarters , as the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign sends out a mailer to supporters warning them that if he loses the Indiana primary on May 3 , billionaire frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s march to the Republican presidential nomination could be â€œall but determined.â€ � â€œIn just five days , Hoosiers will cast their votes to determine which candidate will capture their 57 delegates .
This is the single , biggest , most important day for our campaign so far , â€ � Cruz writes .
â€œCarly
and I are barnstorming Indiana to capture every last vote â€ “ as we fight to win the GOP nomination .
I canâ€
™ t emphasize enough how important the vote in Indiana is going to be , and frankly , it could be the deciding factor .
Friend , let me be blunt : I canâ€ ™ t win Indiana â€ “ and this nomination â€ “ if you donâ€ ™ t step forward right now.â€ �
Cruz tells voters that â€œIndiana is absolutely pivotal , â€ � and that â€œif
Trump wins all the delegates in Indiana , his nomination could be all but determined.â€ � Perennial presidential candidate and former consumer advocate Ralph Nader told CNN today that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders should not drop out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination , in part because Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton could be indicted .
â€œWhy why should Bernie Sanders drop out?â€ � Nader , a former Green party nominee , asked CNN Newsroom .
â€œThere could be a scandal with Hillary Clinton .
Those transcripts and closed door meetings with the big bankers and other corporations could be released.â€ �
Asked what he would do in Sandersâ€ ™ position , Nader dodged .
â€œWell , I would never have run in the Democratic Party , so thatâ€ ™ s a question I can not answer , â€ �
Nader said .
â€œ[Sanders ] ran in the Democratic party and heâ€ ™ s doing very , very well .
In fact , if independent voters could vote in those primaries this last Tuesday , he would have won them all.â€ �
Following the passage of the so - called â€œbathroom lawâ€ � in North Carolina and an anti - LGBT religious liberty law in Mississippi , similar laws have percolated throughout the country .
Itâ€ ™ s the largest legal push against LGBT rights in memory , according to Eunice Rho , advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union .
She told the Guardian that in 2016 more than 150 such bills have been proposed across the nation , many in the south .
â€œItâ€
™ s politically driven , â€ � she said .
â€œPoliticians are preying on peopleâ€ ™ s fears of the unfamiliar.â€ �
On Wednesday , Tennessee governor Bill Haslam signed a bill into law that moves the argument in a new direction : it allows therapists and counselors to reject certain clients if the therapy goes against the practitionerâ€ ™ s
â€œsincerely held principlesâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s being widely interpreted as a loophole allowing therapists to reject gay , lesbian , transgender and other clients .
Haslam has since issued a written statement saying thatâ€ ™ s a misinterpretation .
â€œThe substance of this bill doesnâ€ ™ t address a group , issue or belief system , â€ � he wrote .
â€œI believe it is reasonable to allow these professionals to determine if and when an individual would be better served by another counselor better suited to meet his or her needs.â€

An unbound Republican delegate in Pennsylvania who had previously endorsed John Kasich appears to have resigned himself to the fact that billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee - and says he would never vote for Texas senator Ted Cruz .
â€œI would never vote for Ted Cruz ,
â€ �
former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg told a local ABC affiliate in Manchester , New Hampshire .
â€œIâ€ ™ d write in Paul Ryan or someone before Iâ€ ™ d vote for Ted Cruz.â€ � â€œI presume Donald Trump is going to be the nominee , â€ � Gregg , a two - term senator , said , before calling Cruz â€œa person of little character .
Heâ€ ™ s a demagogueâ€ ™ s demagogue and he shouldnâ€ ™ t be trusted with the responsibilities of the office.â€ � â€œI presume Iâ€ ™
d vote for the Republican nominee if it is Trump , but Cruz should be nowhere near the presidency.â€ � John Kasich told spectators at an Oregon town hall event that Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s hopes of swaying unbound delegates to support his bid for the Republican nomination are unfounded , and that if he wants to become the nominee , â€œhe better get exactly what he needs.â€ � â€œWhen
you have a 73 % negative rating among married women and you think you are going to the convention , and you lose 15 straight polls to Hillary Clinton , and you get crushed in the electoral college , and we know that if you are the nominee , youâ€ ™ re going to lose the senate , the supreme court , the courthouse and the state house ...
â€ �
Kasich told the crowd , â€œI donâ€ ™ t think so.â€ �
Trump has the support of 953 bound delegates and 41 unbound delegates , putting him at 994 total delegates , within striking distance of the 1,237 needed to clinch the Republican nomination .
Neither Kasich nor fellow Republican hopeful Ted Cruz can feasibly acquire the necessary number of delegates to reach that threshold before the partyâ€ ™ s convention in July .
An organization dedicated to fighting anti - Semitism has issued a statement urging billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump to reconsider the use of â€œAmerica Firstâ€ � as his â€œill - advisedâ€ � campaign slogan to describe his foreign policy doctrine .
â€œThe most noteworthy leader of the â€˜America
First Committeeâ€ ™ was Charles Lindbergh , who sympathized with the Nazis and whose rhetoric was characterized by anti - Semitism and offensive stereotypes , including assertions that Jews posed a threat to the US because of their influence in motion pictures , radio , the press , and the government ,
â€ � wrote the Anti - Defamation League in in a statement .
â€œThe undercurrents of anti - Semitism and bigotry that characterized the America First movement â€ “ including the assumption that Jews who opposed the movement had their own agenda and were not acting in Americaâ€ ™ s best interest â€ “ is fortunately not a major concern today , â€ � said Jonathan A. Greenblatt , CEO of the Anti - Defamation League .
â€œHowever , for many Americans , the term â€˜America Firstâ€ ™ will always be associated with and tainted by this history .
In a political season that already has prompted a national conversation about civility and tolerance , choosing a call to action historically associated with incivility and intolerance seems ill - advised.â€ �
At an event in Oregon , Ohio governor and Republican candidate for president John Kasich told supporters that after Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s electoral wipeout earlier this week , he had considered dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination .
â€œI thought about , â€˜Should I keep going ?
Should I carry on ?
What is this all about?â€ ™ â€ � Kasich said .
But in the end , it came down to a conversation with his wife .
â€œI was down home yesterday for a short time , and things were a little bit crazy ...
and I saw my wife carrying some clothes from the upstairs bedroom down into the closet in the basement
and I said , â€˜here , lemme grab some of that , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œAnd I said , â€˜what do you think , sweetie ?
Iâ€ ™ m inclined to keep going.â€ ™
She looked at me , she said - just simple words because sheâ€ ™ s not a politician
- she said , â€˜The people need a choice , and if you donâ€ ™ t give â€˜em a choice , who will?â€ ™ â€ � â€œAnd so Iâ€ ™ ve decided to keep going ,
â€ � he concluded ,
to loud applause .
In an interview with Politico , a former high - ranking member of Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s failed 2012 presidential campaign has compared billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump to party icon Ronald Reagan , and said that Trump will win the nomination .
â€œYou could sense a more growing sense of reality that , in fact , Trump is going to be the nominee , â€ � said Ron Kaufman , a former advisor to Romney and one of the main engineers of his presidential campaign in 2012 .
â€œHe was a populist more than a conservative , â€ �
Kaufman said of Reagan .
â€œHe was a western populist ; Trump is an eastern populist.â€ �
Romney returned to the national stage years after his loss with a blistering indictment of Trump , dubbing the frontrunner â€œa phonyâ€ � and â€œa fraudâ€ � in an address in Salt Lake City , Utah .
A survey of 2,008 American adults conducted by the Pew Research Center has found that the publicâ€ ™ s negative opinion of the Republican party has spiked to levels not seen in nearly a quarter - century .
Only 33 % of the American public has a favorable view of the Republican party , while nearly two - thirds - 62 % - say that they have an unfavorable view of the party .
Itâ€ ™ s an increase in negative views of the party from last October , when a still - not - great 58 % told Pew Research Center that they viewed the Republican party unfavorably .
The frustration with the direction of the party has even passed on to card - carrying members of the party , only 68 % of whom view the Republican party positively .
By comparison , the Democratic party is viewed positively by 88 % of its members .
Just 28 % of independents view the Republican party favorably .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s big foreign policy speech at the National Press Club in Washington , DC yesterday has received a cold reception from the editorial board of the New York Times , which derided the address as failing to exhibit â€œmuch grasp of the complexity of the world , understanding of the balance or exercise of power , or even a careful reading of history.â€ �
In an editorial titled Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s Strange Worldview , the Grey Ladyâ€ ™ s editorial board summed up a potential â€œTrump
Doctrineâ€ � as : â€œWhen one has a hammer , everything looks like a nail .
And when oneâ€ ™ s experience is limited to real estate deals , everything looks like a lease negotiation.â€ �
This unilateral approach makes for good television , but this is the real world , in which other nations have agendas , too .
Mr. Trump says he is â€˜going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world , all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence.â€ ™
But how will he gain cooperation for his â€˜unpredictableâ€ ™ war on the Islamic State while enforcing a â€˜pauseâ€ ™ that prevents Muslims from entering this country , and forcing those living here to register themselves ?
How does one â€˜apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea , â€ ™ while slapping a trade - killing tariff on Chinese imports ?
Itâ€ ™ s correct that many of our NATO allies arenâ€ ™ t paying their agreed - upon share of its costs - but what happens to the United Statesâ€ ™ overseas bases if we â€˜walk?â€ ™
The editorial concludes that Trump has failed to demonstrate â€œany willingness to learn or to correct his past errors .
For someone who claims he is ready to lead the free world , that is inexcusable.â€ �
Texas senator Ted Cruz fired back at former House speaker John Boehner for comments comparing the Republican presidential hopeful to â€œLuciferâ€ � after his announcement of Carly Fiorina as his running mate .
Cruz said he was surprised and claims to have never worked with the speaker .
Boehner also said that although he gets along â€œwith almost everyone ... I have never worked with a more miserable son - of - a - bitch in my life.â€ �
Caitlyn Jenner has put billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s promise to allow transgender people to use whichever bathroom they feel most comfortable in at Trump Tower to the test .
The result : no problem .
In a Facebook video posted this morning , the Olympic gold medalist and reality television star used the womenâ€ ™ s room at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City without complications .
Transgender Americans received an unlikely endorsement from Trump when he told NBCâ€ ™ s Today show that transgender people should be allowed to choose the bathroom they use , and promised Jenner that she could use a restroom of her choosing at Trump Tower any time she wanted .
Hillary Clinton is fundraising off of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s comments regarding her gender by giving donors physical â€œWoman Cardsâ€ � - which more - than - vaguely resemble New York Cityâ€ ™ s MetroCard .
â€œWoman Cardsâ€ � swipe a lot easier than MetroCards , in our experience .
Senator Ted Cruz has little patience for campaign pranks : Bernie Sanders is scheduled to hold a campaign event in Springfield , Oregon , this afternoon - hereâ€ ™ s the livestream :
With a poll showing nearly half of Republican female voters donâ€ ™ t plan to support Donald Trump , his nomination looks disastrous for a party trying to reinvent itself , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino :
For the Republican women who have spent the past few years working to broaden the appeal of the Grand Old Party , Donald Trump arrived on the scene like a wrecking ball , tearing down the foundations they had laid over the past few years to try to create a more diverse and open party .
With his penchant for bluster and disdain for political correctness , there are few slices of the American electorate the billionaire businessman has yet to offend .
But one group in particular poses a real problem for Trump , should he become the nominee , and for the party , should it win the presidency and keep control of Congress in November â€ “ and that group happens to make up 51 % of the population .
â€œGeneral election women voters think heâ€
™ s abhorrent , â€ � said Katie Packer , the chairwoman of Our Principles PAC , which opposes Trump .
â€œThey think heâ€
™ s a sexist .
They think he doesnâ€ ™ t respect women , and doesnâ€ ™ t really view women in any real way beyond their physical appearance .
â€œIf the party leadership embraces Donald Trump as the general election nominee than I think it will damage our party for a generation.â€ � Donald Trump may have just coined a new word : â€œEffectuate.â€ �
The importance of defeating Hillary Clinton , the likely Democratic presidential nominee , is paramount , Trump tells the audience in Indiana , â€œso we can really effectuate all of the things and get our country really going again.â€ � UPDATE :
We stand humbled .
â€œI would never use the word â€˜bribe.â€ ™
Some people would say bribes the delegates - I would never say a thing like that ,
â€ �
Trump says of opponent Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s relationship with potential convention delegates .
Still , thereâ€ ™ s a risk that in the second and third ballots , delegates who have been â€œbribedâ€ � into supporting Cruz .
â€œWhy ?
Because they like to have good meals - which Iâ€ ™ m not doing.â€
�
But , he cautions the audience , â€œIt
doesnâ€ ™ t mean anything if we win on the first.â€ �
â€œNobody respects women more than Donald Trump ,
â€ � says Trump , who two nights ago said that Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s only asset as a candidate is her â€œwomanâ€ ™ s card.â€
�
I will be so much better to women than Hillary Clinton .
So much better .
On health care issues .
And on the protection of our country ... we are in an evil world right now ... and Iâ€ ™ m going to protect our country .
Trump has been boasting about how as president he would return manufacturing to the United States : Weâ€ ™ re gon na have a time , if I win , where Apple is going to make its product in the United States .
Is that a threat , or a promise ?
Trump has repeatedly called for taxes on companies , such as once - Indiana - local Carrier , that move their manufacturing centers overseas .
Trump says he did not want to take too much time off after his quintuple victories of this Tuesday because he knew â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � was at work in Indiana : I didnâ€ ™ t want to take too much time because I know youâ€ ™ ve got him back here lyinâ€
™ like hell , so I said better get back here .
Gosh they hate him , donâ€ ™ t
they ?
Representative Peter King says the Cruz - Lucifer comparison drawn Wednesday by former House speaker John Boehner is an insult â€ “ to Lucifer : The Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs is conducting an informal online poll about whether the Labour Party or the Grand Old Party is nearer to absolute collapse .
You have to vote to find out what the crowd thinks .
We will remark only that itâ€ ™ s not even close : Dangerous , foolish , irrational , scary , terrifying , irresponsible , a clown , a disaster .
These are just some of the words used to describe the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency by politicians , diplomats and analysts around the world , write the Guardianâ€ ™ s David Smith and Julian
Borger : As the businessman gave his first major policy address since becoming frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday , Guardian correspondents in Washington and around the globe asked the international community whether it was prepared for the swaggering billionaire to occupy the White House .
Many said they still can not believe the nation that elected its first black president just eight years ago will now rush to embrace a man who has offended Mexicans , Muslims and others .
The possibility that Trump might actually win fills great swaths of the planet with dread â€ “ with the apparent and notable exception of Vladimir Putinâ€ ™ s Russia â€ “ with concerns over everything from trade to the nuclear trigger .
While Trump was delivering his speech in Washington , outlining a doctrine of naked self - interest that would â€œshake the rust off Americaâ€ ™ s foreign policyâ€ � , the heads of all the major UN agencies gathered in Vienna , Austria , for a strategy session with secretary general Ban Ki - moon , now in his last eight months in office .

The story behind the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s California operation sheds new light on the internal power struggle that has rocked the campaign in recent weeks , writes Guardian west coast bureau chief Paul Lewis :
Tim Clark was asked if he was interested in running Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign in California earlier this month .
â€œInterested?â€ � he recalls telling an emissary for the Republican frontrunner .
â€œYou bet Iâ€ ™ m interested .
Iâ€ ™ m about to fall out of my chair.â€
�
Clark could have been forgiven for assuming the job of Trumpâ€ ™ s state director in California â€ “ the most delegate - rich primary contest , and the one likely to determine the outcome of the 2016 Republican race â€ “ would involve being thrust into the billionaireâ€ ™ s inner circle .
Yet more than two weeks into the role , Clark has still not met with Trump or even spoken with him on the phone .
â€œI
havenâ€
™ t talked to him , â€ � he conceded , when pressed over the extent of his communications with Trump .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s been , you know , email traffic and things like that.â€
�
The fact Trump has yet to talk to the strategist in command of the all - important California primary contest may say more about the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s centralized presidential campaign than it does about Clark .
On the other hand , it turns out Clark was not an uncontroversial pick .
Stuart Jolly , who until recently was Trumpâ€ ™ s national field director , said he considered Clark for the role but decided he was not qualified enough .
â€œI had already ruled him out , â€ �
he said .

Teddy Schleifer captures Cruzâ€ ™ s lengthier response to Boehnerâ€ ™ s
â€œLuciferâ€ � insult : Earlier this week , the Ted Cruz and John Kasich campaigns released simultaneous statements describing coordinated efforts in the upcoming states of Indiana , Oregon and New Mexico .
The deal was , supposedly , that Kasich would stay away from Indiana while Cruz stayed away from the other two , allowing a sole candidate to go head - to - head with Trump .
Neither candidate publicly made a statement about the alliance , which some Indiana voters have been reported as finding too cute by half .
But Kasich undercut the supposed alliance a bit by saying that if people in Indiana want to vote for him , they should .
And now Cruz flatly denies there was ever an alliance , reports CNN : At which Kasichâ€ ™ s chief strategist uses the L word : For what itâ€ ™ s worth , Kasich is campaigning today in Oregon , which will divide its 28 delegates proportionally on 17 May , while Cruz has a whole week of Indiana events planned .
Barack Obama has accused the Republican presidential candidates of defying logic and peddling â€œfantasyâ€ � in telling voters they can cut taxes and government regulations , balance the budget and produce economic growth .
â€œIf you look at the platforms , the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president , they donâ€
™ t simply defy logic and any known economic theories , they are fantasy , â€ � Obama said , in an extensive and at times surprisingly frank reflection on his economic legacy in an interview with the New York Timesâ€ ™ s Andrew Ross Sorkin .
The president admits some economic missteps in the interview , including a failure to initiate a significant infrastructure spending project and to sufficiently boost wages .
While the economy has grown during the Obama presidency and unemployment has been cut in half , a near - record number of Americans have dropped out of the workforce and real median incomes have fallen , while wealth and income inequality have grown .
In other words , the economy is working for some but not working for others .
Obama admits as much in the interview : I can probably tick off three or four common - sense things we could have done
where weâ€ ™ d be growing a percentage or two faster each year ...
We could have brought down the unemployment rate lower , faster .
We could have been lifting wages even faster than we did .
And those things keep me up at night sometimes .
The presidentâ€ ™ s main contention , however â€ “ made with an insistence that he feels no personal frustration about the matter â€ “ is that the political discourse has left the public with an inaccurately dim view of his stewardship of the economy , which when he took office was suffering from the housing meltdown , growing unemployment , a credit crisis inside the countryâ€ ™ s biggest banks and the looming potential failure of giant insurance companies .
Culprits for the erosion of this discourse , in the presidentâ€ ™ s view , include the Republican party , which has incessantly repeated that the economic recovery since 2008 has been too slow , while stubbornly refusing to take part in any plan out of the White House to speed the recovery , especially any plan that includes tax hikes .
Blame is shared by the current crop of Republican presidential candidates , in the view of the president , who dismissed the GOP campaign - trail economic platforms as implausible .
â€œSlashing taxes particularly for those at the very top , dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 % or 7 % growth , and claiming that theyâ€ ™ ll do all this while balancing the budget , â€ � Obama said .
â€œNobody would even , with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics , think that any of those things are plausible.â€ �
He continued : If we canâ€ ™ t puncture some of the mythology around austerity , politics or tax cuts or the mythology thatâ€ ™ s been built up around the Reagan revolution , where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts , as opposed to a shift in interest - rate policy â€ ” if we canâ€ ™ t describe that effectively , then weâ€ ™ re doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes .
Obama counts among his regrets a failure to set up a big infrastructure spending project , he told Sorkin : The fact of the matter is , is that our failure in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , to initiate a massive infrastructure project
â€
”
it was the perfect time to do it ; low interest rates , construction industry is still on its heels , massive need
â€
” the fact that we failed to do that , for example , cost us time ...
It meant that there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery .
The president does not suffer from an unfairly grim assessment of his own performance , however .
â€œI actually compare our economic performance to how , historically , countries that have wrenching financial crises perform , â€ � Obama said .
â€œBy that measure , we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history.â€ �

Cruz - Fiorina is addressing reporters before their Fort Wayne event .
Cruz has welcomed John Boehnerâ€ ™ s calling him Lucifer , tweeting , â€œtell me again who will stand up to Washington?â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s
Twitter has been retweeting people celebrating the Boehner dig as an endorsement : And current speaker Paul Ryan stays far away from the Lucifer talk : Ted Cruz is scheduled to pop up for a campaign rally in Fort Wayne , Indiana , any time now .
Surveil this live video stream if youâ€ ™ d like to see the man John Boehner calls â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � in action Texas senator Ted Cruz has scored what is indisputably the strongest non - endorsement of the 2016 cycle .
Former House speaker John Boehner told a Stanford University crowd on Wednesday evening that Cruz is â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � .
Boehner continued , according to a Stanford Daily report : I have Democrat friends and Republican friends .
I get along with almost everyone , but I have never worked with a more miserable son - of - a - bitch in my life .
Lucifer !
Miserable son - of - a - bitch !
Not to put too fine a point on it .
In fact Boehner has called Cruz â€œLuciferâ€ � before , and for good measure deemed the senator a â€œjackassâ€ � for his role in the government shutdown of 2013 .
Cruz held what must have been frustrating sway , for Boehner , over the Tea Party wing of the House as Boehner tried to cobble together various coalitions to keep the government funded and avoid crashing the debt ceiling and pass a border security bill , among other efforts .
As for Cruz nemesis Donald Trump , Boehner said they had played golf together for years and that they are â€œtexting buddies.â€
�
Cruz has not issued a reply to the former Ohio congressmanâ€ ™ s assessment .
He might say that Boehner , who spent 30 years in Congress and was known for having a comfortable relationship with lobbyists , represents everything that is wrong with the Republican establishment .
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Texas senator Ted Cruz created some electricity on Wednesday evening with his announcement that , should he win the Republican presidential nomination , the bumper stickers would read Cruz - Fiorina , as in Carly , the former tech executive ( and presidential candidate ) .
Fiorina made a punchy appearance with Cruz in Indianapolis culminating in a lullaby she sang to Cruzâ€ ™ s kids : The challenge for Cruz - Fiorina is to inspire Republican primary voters in Indiana , which will award 30 delegates to its statewide winner this coming Tuesday in a contest billed as a last stand for the # NeverTrump movement .
Fiorina was up early on Thursday to argue that Donald Trump , who is leading in the ( scant ) polls in the Hoosier state , is just the same as Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton : I put them in the same category because they are the same category .
Theyâ€ ™ re two sides of the same coin ...
I do think for some of us , principles matter , and convictions matter , and policies and principles matter .
It has been reported that Fiorina , early in the primary process , was uniquely capable of getting under the skin of Trump , who was advised to ignore her but mostly could not .
Heâ€ ™ s on Twitter this morning not ignoring her
, in fact : Trump holds events in Evansville , Indiana , and Costa Mesa , California , today , while John Kasich is in Portland and Medford , Oregon , and Bernie Sanders is in Springfield , Oregon .
Did you catch Trumpâ€ ™ s big foreign policy speech on Wednesday ?
Did you have the nagging sense that it didnâ€ ™ t make sense and may in fact have been packed with internal contradictions abetted by an absence of any real detail ?
You werenâ€ ™ t imagining things , writes Dan Roberts : And hereâ€ ™ s a curveball story : a top Cruz campaign operative in Virginia has visited Syria and turns out to be a Bashar Assad apologist : Thanks for joining us today , and as always , visit us in the comments !"
2016-04-28,"Yesterday Ted Cruz named Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett - Packard CEO turned failed presidential candidate , as his running mate in this election .
But who is she , again ?
Fiorina , 61 , served as the first female CEO of a top 20 Fortune - rated company , an adviser to the John McCain presidential campaign in 2008 , and was the only female Republican candidate running in this election season .
What about her beginnings ?
Fiorina was born in Texas but attended schools across the country and in London and Ghana .
Her father had a very successful legal career â€ “ as dean of Duke Universityâ€ ™ s law school , deputy US attorney general and judge of the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit â€ “ and moved the family around a lot during Fiorinaâ€ ™ s childhood .
She graduated with a BA from Stanford in 1976 and briefly attended UCLAâ€ ™ s law school before dropping out and getting her MBA at the University of Maryland in 1980 .
During college she even briefly worked as a â€œKelly girlâ€ � , or a typist at Hewlett - Packard , a company she later led .
She oversaw a restructure that resulted in 30,000 people getting fired , which saw her dubbed Chainsaw Carly by her colleagues .
She got fired from Hewlett - Packard , leaving with a $ 21 m severance package .
What do we know about her political views ?
Like most Republicans , sheâ€ ™ s very conservative on womenâ€ ™ s health .
Fiorina is anti - abortion and wants to pass the Pain - Capable Unborn Child Protection Act â€ “ which bans abortion after 20 weeks â€ “ and believes Planned Parenthood should be stripped of all government funding .
Fiorina doesnâ€
™ t support same - sex marriage and thinks the supreme court overstepped its mark by allowing same - sex marriage in all 50 states last year .
But sheâ€ ™ s very vocal about equal pay and the representation of women in government and the workforce .
Fiorina recorded a pretty amusing video with BuzzFeed last year , while she was still running for president , titled
â€œWhat if women talked like men in the workplaceâ€ � .
Whatâ€ ™ s the deal with her personal life ?
Her second husband Frank started off as a technician at AT&amp;T and ended up as its vice - president .
The pair met while working at AT&amp;T together , getting hitched in 1985 .
Frank had two daughters from his previous marriage , Lori and Tracy .
Her stepdaughter , Lori , died of a drug overdose in 2009 , at age 35 .
Fiorina brought up her stepdaughter , who battled alcohol , drug abuse and eating disorders , at a Republican debate in September .
â€œI am the only person on this stage who can say this , but I know there are millions of Americans out there who will say the same thing .
My husband , Frank , and I buried a child to drug addiction , so we must invest more in the treatment of drugs ,
â€ � she said .
Fiorina dedicated her second memoir to Lori .
How can she help Cruz ?
Three key things : women , business and California .
Top female Republican strategists told the Guardian they despise Trump for his attitudes towards women â€ “ a line Cruz has been trying to take advantage of by hosting Women for Cruz events â€ “ so a strong female executive candidate offers voters a good reason to pick Cruz .
When introducing her as his running mate , the senator from Texas declared in a press release that as â€œa groundbreaking executive and the first woman to lead a Fortune 50 company , Fiorina brings a record of innovation and tremendous leadership to the Cruz campaignâ€ � .
Noting her business skills and trailblazing female leadership seems a deliberate nod to both billionaire businessman Donald Trump and the possible first female president Hillary Clinton .
Cruz also noted Fiorina is â€œan outsider to politicsâ€ � in an election season where being anti - establishment is regarded as an advantage .
Finally , sheâ€ ™ s well - known in California thanks to her tech - biz history and her past political aspirations when she won the Republican primary for a 2010 US Senate race in California but lost the general .
How might she cause trouble for Cruz ?
Fiorina was never very popular , and she dropped out in early February after disappointing poll results in New Hampshire ( sheâ€ ™ d only gotten 1.9 % of the vote in Iowa ) .
Maybe her past Senate race in California wonâ€ ™ t be the boon Cruz is hoping for : she lost and moved from the Golden State to Virginia .
â€œShe was a very mean opponent , and the bottom line is they rejected her .
And now , sheâ€
™ s coming back again
â€ “ itâ€ ™ s like a bad dream , â€ � said Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer , who beat Fiorina by 10 points in California in the Senate race .
Anything else interesting ?
She speaks Italian fluently â€ “ and lived in Italy in the 1970s with her first husband .
She survived breast cancer in 2009 , and underwent a double mastectomy .
Fiorina also owns two yachts â€ “ Alchemy V and VI , which her opponent Boxer used as ammunition against her ."
2016-04-28,"My favorite part of American Idol was always the initial audition period , because that was when the least talented , most delusional people were on TV unintentionally creating comedy gold .
This eternal presidential primary season has been a lot like that â€ “ and Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s announcement Wednesday of Carly Fiorina as his running mate was no exception .
Picking a running mate when he has almost no chance of becoming the Republican party nominee is just the sort of desperate move Iâ€ ™ ve come to expect from Cruz , but thatâ€ ™ s another column .
Today I want to focus on Fiorina and that creepy song she sang to Cruzâ€ ™ s daughters on live television .
You want to talk about playing the woman card ?
If Fiorina were a man , weâ€ ™ d all be calling for To Catch a Predatorâ€ ™ s
Chris Hansen just about now , because that song was the stuff of little girlsâ€ ™ nightmares .
Just like those ill - advised American Idol contestants , Fiorina probably thought it was a great idea to sing to Cruzâ€ ™ s kids on live TV .
After all , everybody told her how great it was when she sang about her dog on Jimmy Fallon .
But that shows a remarkable inability to distinguish the appropriateness of a given venue .
In case youâ€ ™ re reading , Carly , let me break it down for you : singing a dopey song about your pet on a late - night comedy talk show is charming .
Singing a dopey song about someone elseâ€ ™ s kids in the middle of a live press conference announcing your intention to become the person a heartbeat away from the presidency is just creepy .
And therein lies the problem with both Fiorina and Cruz .
They are 100 % university - bred titans of law and industry who excel at academic theory , but they are completely out of their depth when it comes to reading social cues and relating to other human beings .
Itâ€ ™ s what makes their appearances stilted , unsettling and ultimately damaging to their campaigns .
Take what happened in Iowa during Fiorinaâ€ ™ s presidential bid .
While she was campaigning in Des Moines last year , she plucked a group of Iowa pre - schoolers from their botanical garden field trip
so they could act as props at a right - to - life forum being held on the same grounds .
Fiorina ushered about 15 tots to the front of the room , where she spoke about harvesting organs from aborted fetuses .
Thatâ€ ™ s the level of social ineptitude weâ€ ™ re dealing with .
When a reporter from the Guardian emailed to ask why using the pre - schoolers seemed like a good idea to Fiorina , a spokesperson said , â€œWe were happy that these children chose to come to Carlyâ€ ™ s event with their adult supervisor.â€ �
Not only do four - year - olds not choose to do anything for themselves , their parents werenâ€ ™ t asked permission , either .
One father interviewed by the Guardian later said the first he knew of the event was when his childcare provider told him about the encounter after the fact .
â€œAfter today , she wouldnâ€ ™ t get my vote for sure ,
â€ � the father said .
But the question remains whether bringing Fiorina onto the Cruz campaign will help bring his presidential bid back from the dead .
And the answer is : probably not .
Trump may not make the magic 1,237-delegate number needed to secure the convention if he doesnâ€ ™ t sweep the next few primaries , which theoretically keeps the nomination in play , but he is still the clear frontrunner
: there are 502 pledged delegates remaining , and Cruz would need 675 to clinch the nomination outright .
It would be great for Democrats if Carly Fiorina ended up on the Republican ticket one way or the other , because women voters would crucify her at the polls ; her anti - abortion zealotry isnâ€ ™ t just scary to children .
Itâ€ ™ s the stuff of grown womenâ€ ™ s nightmares , too .
She supports overturning Roe v Wade and revoking womenâ€ ™ s right to a safe , legal abortion .
And she promised during her presidential campaign that , were she elected , she would sign into law a bill based on the scientifically debunked theory of fetal pain .
Not to mention she wants to completely defund Planned Parenthood , and her most high - profile presidential campaign moment was when she spewed lies on national television about the organization based on doctored videos shot by pro - life activists who were later indicted for fraud by a Houston grand jury .
Iâ€ ™ m ready for this political circus to stop .
Even American Idolâ€ ™ s reign of terror has finally come to an end
â€ “ and the company that owns it just filed for bankruptcy .
Because watching delusional egomaniacs strut their stuff is funny at first , but after a while , you begin to crave something more substantial than this ."

2016-04-29,"The two men hired by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz to spearhead their presidential campaigns in California are , for the moment , rivals in what could be the most important primary race of 2016 .
But four years ago , Tim Clark and Ron Nehring , who are running the California campaigns for Trump and Cruz respectively , worked as paid advisers to a campaign to elect a Guatemalan presidential candidate whose platform included a call for public executions .
Clark and Nehring , the Guardian can reveal , spent six weeks in Guatemala in 2011 working as advisers to Manuel BaldÃ­zon , a rightwing populist and business tycoon who campaigned on the promise of broadcasting the executions of criminals on TV .
The pair of Republican political consultants , now at the helm of competing presidential campaigns in California , were paid to advise BaldÃ­zon by what Clark elliptically refers to as â€œbusiness interestsâ€ � .
Clark confirmed the pairâ€ ™ s involvement in the Guatemalan campaign during a wide - ranging interview with the Guardian .
â€œRon called and asked me to come down .
He had the contact ,
â€ �
Clark said .
â€œâ€˜Hey Clark , I could use a little help down here .
What do you think?â€
™ â€ � â€œWe had bodyguards .
We had translators .
We drove around in a black SUV full of semi - automatic machine guns in the back.â€ � â€œIt was interesting , â€ �
Clark said of the experience .
â€œGlad I came out alive.â€ � BaldÃ­zonâ€ ™ s political career in Guatemala has long been linked to unsavory patronage â€ “ a concern that InsightCrime , a group that investigates organized crime in the Americas , reports is fueled by his refusal to disclose the identity of the private donors who bankroll his campaigns .
Dr Michael Allison , a Latin America expert and associate professor of political science at the University of Scranton , said BaldÃ­zon had faced questions over campaign finance improprieties .
â€œAs a candidate in 2011 , BaldÃ­zon ran on a platform where he promised to make use of televised executions , â€ �
he said , describing him as a populist â€œwho promised everything to everybodyâ€ � .
â€œHe promised to get the countryâ€ ™ s national soccer team to qualify for the World Cup.â€ � BaldÃ­zon has never been charged with a crime and has strenuously denied any wrongdoing .
Clark said he and Nehring met with BaldÃ­zon and advised his campaign , traveling the country with him and attending rallies .
But Clark said they were â€œa step removedâ€ � because their work was paid for by corporate interests and they were not formally part of the campaign .
â€œIn many ways it felt like you were the shiny object in the room : â€˜Oh , the American strategists are here.â€ ™
But Ron did a really good job of helping set him [ BaldÃ­zon ] on message , I felt , â€ �
he said .
While Nehring took care of political messaging around free - market issues , Clark said , his role was â€œto assist Ron , to run the metrics , to look at it , to see where and what and howâ€ � .
Following the interview , Clark emailed the Guardian a statement playing down their work for BaldÃ­zon .
He stressed that he and Nehring â€œwere not in any way privy to all of the campaignâ€ ™ s media and messaging strategiesâ€
� .
â€œWorking under Ronâ€ ™ s umbrella , our role was specifically advising , where possible , on free market , economic growth policies , â€ � he wrote .
â€œIf our time there was made to look more than this , it would be a completely inaccurate portrayal of our activities.â€ �
Clark also said in the email that he did not know about BaldÃ­zonâ€ ™ s campaign promise of televising executions â€ “ even though it was widely reported in the international media as well as the Guatemalan press .
â€œI am unaware of his platform regarding public safety , â€ � he said .
Guatemala is not known as a clean place to make money from politics .
Last year , an investigation by a UN - backed anti - impunity organization exposed the widespread infiltration in Guatemalan politics by criminal groups and business interests seeking political favors and public contracts .
Guatemalan political parties receive half their financing through corruption , according to the report published in July 2015 by CICIG .
â€œGuatemala is the perfect country to commit electoral crimes without consequences , â€ � said director of CICIG Ivan Velasquez Gomez at the time .
During the 2011 general election campaign , political parties spent at least $ 56 m more than they declared , according to an inquiry by Citizen Action , the Guatemalan chapter of Transparency International .
BaldÃ­zonâ€ ™ s
Lider party spent almost three times the amount legally allowed in the 2011 campaign that Clark and Nehring worked on , Citizen Action concluded .
Clark declined to identify the Guatemalan business interests that paid for their trips , saying only that they were â€œcorporate industry guys who could afford itâ€ � .
In another followup email , Clark added : â€œAny indication whatsoever that either Ron or I had any knowledge or connection in any way with anyone other than legitimate and legal business interests in Guatemala would be grossly inaccurate.â€ �
Neither Clark nor Nehring mention their work for BaldÃ­zon on their company websites â€ “ although both make references to having worked in Guatemala .
Nehring , a regular guest on CNN , states on his website that he has been â€œa volunteer expert lecturer and trainerâ€ � for government officials and politicians in Guatemala , Bosnia , Serbia , Morocco , Egypt and Iraq .
He did not respond to multiple requests for comment about his paid work with Clark in Guatemala .
Although Clark and Nehring are now on opposite sides of a presidential race , they have been close associates for several years .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think he wants to talk to me and I donâ€ ™ t want to talk to him right now , â€ �
Clark said during the interview .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not out of animosity , itâ€ ™ s just out of respect.â€ �
Clark said that he was shocked by the economic inequality he saw in Guatemala and â€ “ in a departure from Trumpâ€ ™ s foreign policy â€ “ said the US should play a more proactive role in the region .
â€œI think America should invest in our neighbors to the south , but thatâ€ ™ s just me , not my candidate , â€ �
he said .
â€œYou drive through dirt floor , no bathroom neighborhoods , you look and you see kids playing , and you think , â€˜howâ€ ™ ?â€ ™ â€ �
he said , recounting his experience of inequality in Guatemala .
â€œThen half a mile down the road you drive in past the gate and
thereâ€ ™ s this palatial thing , and you think , â€˜what is this , how can someone have all this , just next to all that?â€ ™
â€ � .
BaldÃ­zonâ€ ™ s net worth is not known .
However , the tycoon is known to have business interests in gas stations , hotel chains , buses , mining , media companies and health clinics , giving him enormous power in Guatemala .
An investigation published just last week by the investigative news magazine Contrapoder accused BaldÃ­zon of profiting from $ 10 m ( 79 m Quetzales ) of public funds by manipulating government works contracts .
He denied the allegations .
Despite the hired help of Clark and Nehring , the businessman ultimately lost the 2011 election to retired military officer Otto Perez Molina .
BaldÃ­zon ran again for the presidency last year and was considered the outright frontrunner until his popularity nose - dived amid anger over corruption in the political establishment .
He resigned from his political party in September .
The following month , Jimmy Morales , a TV comedian with no political experience , was elected president of Guatemala .
Morales has been described as â€œGuatemalaâ€ ™ s version of Donald Trumpâ€ � .
As it happens , Clark said he was also offered a role in the Morales campaign too .
â€œI had my friends call , â€ � he said .
â€œâ€˜Tim , you want to come and work for the comedian ?
Nah , Iâ€ ™ m OK .
Iâ€ ™ ve been there once.â€ ™ â€ �
Clark added : â€œBut it was funny .
Guatemala elected a comedian as their president.â€ �

2016-04-30,"Hillary Clinton emerged this week as all but certain to secure the Democratic partyâ€ ™ s nomination for president after a drawn - out and at times contentious battle with Vermont senator Bernie Sanders .
And with just seven weeks remaining in the presidential primaries , Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign has begun to pivot toward the general election â€ “ a process that will include selecting a running mate ahead of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this July .
Ted Cruz drew headlines for taking the unusual step of naming his vice - presidential pick , despite lacking a plausible path to his partyâ€ ™ s nomination in an increasingly forlorn effort to stop Donald Trump .
As the Texas senator stood alongside Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett - Packard CEO who dropped out of the Republican race in February , a new wave of speculation was launched about what the Democratic ticket might look like .
For Clinton , a diverse bench offers a wide array of possibilities â€ “ ranging from rising stars within the party to calculations rooted in demographics and the electoral map in November .
Allies have floated senators from key battleground states , such as Tim Kaine and Mark Warner , both of swing state Virginia , and Sherrod Brown , a senator from Ohio who is also popular with the progressive wing of the party .
Some have suggested that an African American or Latino vice - presidential candidate would help energize core constituencies of the Democratic base who twice helped enthusiastically elect Barack Obama .
That shortlist could include New Jersey senator Cory Booker and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick , both of whom are African American , as well as two Hispanic members of Obamaâ€ ™ s administration :
JuliÃ¡n Castro , the housing secretary ; and Tom Perez , the US labor chief .
Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign chairman John Podesta said an all - female ticket would also be considered , a move that would potentially shatter two glass ceilings with one stone .
The Democratic Senate includes several prominent women , including progressive icon Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota .
But for all the possible political machinations , allies and supporters said Clinton would be a nominee with unparalleled experience : as a former first lady , two - term senator , and secretary of state .
And with a Republican party currently being torn apart at the seams by frontrunner Trump , there would be ample opportunity to draw a symbolic contrast , regardless of a vice - presidential candidateâ€ ™ s gender , as well as their geographic or demographic background .
â€œThis is going to be a contrast between strength , stability , and competence and an entertainment show , â€ � said Missouri senator Claire McCaskill , a Clinton surrogate .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re going up against something that is superficial and flashy , itâ€ ™ s really good to have a ticket that just oozes strength and stability.â€
� â€œMy ideal ticket is Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine ,
â€ �
she added in an endorsement of her Senate colleague from Virginia , pointing to his experience at both the federal and state level and his fluency in Spanish .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s incredibly knowledgeable , a great communicator , has a firm grasp on the complexity of foreign policy , and he also understands in his bones the importance of social justice issues , â€ � McCaskill said .
Paul Begala , a former adviser to Bill Clinton , also said he believed Clinton would first and foremost weigh who was best prepared to be one step removed from the nationâ€ ™ s highest office .
Although he is legally barred from coordinating with the campaign , as a consultant and adviser to Priorities of the pro - Clinton fundraising Super Pac Priorities USA Action , Begala said he was confident after watching Clinton closely for more than two decades that she would act on a similar model as Bill Clinton and Obama .
â€œShe begins with a governing frame , not a campaign frame , â€ � Begala said , adding that he recalled Clinton being impressed with Obamaâ€ ™ s selection of Joe Biden .
â€œHe has been a really terrific partner for the president , and that will matter to her a lot .
Who can be a really good partner and help me govern?â€
�
Begala also downplayed the conventional wisdom that a running mate must bring a certain balance to the ticket .
Al Gore , for example , was a choice who , if anything , reinforced many of the characteristics embodied by Bill Clinton â€ “ a young southerner and face of the so - called New Democrats .
Begala , who ran Clintonâ€ ™ s 1992 campaign , said he had been leaning toward Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania for more of a conventional political balance .
He then recounted asking Bill Clinton why he ultimately chose Gore .
â€œBill turned to me and said : â€˜Because I might die , Pauly.â€ ™ â€ �
One key factor that sets apart this particular election is the uncertainty surrounding the opposing party .
Although Trump remains the clear frontrunner , having swept this weekâ€ ™ s primaries on the east coast , it remains possible that thebombastic billionaire will not secure the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the Republican nomination .
Party elites are gearing up for a contested convention in Cleveland in July , where efforts to thwart Trump may reach a fever pitch .
One senior Democrat who advises political campaigns said the assessment might differ if a candidate such as Marco Rubio , a bilingual Cuban American , were to resurface on the Republican side .
The senator from Florida , who suspended his presidential campaign last month , has categorically ruled out any interest in the vice - presidency , and aides said they did not anticipate that to change .
Ohio governor John Kasich would also be a more formidable addition to a Republican ticket .
But the last Republican establishment candidate standing has struggled in the delegate race and remains an unlikely savior to the partyâ€ ™ s woes .
There is , of course , little precedence to indicate that vice - presidential picks are significantly consequential â€ “ with Sarah Palin , the former Alaska governor chosen by Republican nominee John McCain in 2008 , ranking as perhaps the lone exception in recent history who clearly caused lasting damage to the credibility of a campaign .
Chris Murphy , a Connecticut Democrat backing Clinton , said while he was pleased to see his colleagues Kaine , Booker and Klobuchar named as potential contenders , the vetting process itself was little more than â€œan interesting parlor
gameâ€ � .
â€œI think a bad vice - presidential pick can sink your candidacy , but Iâ€ ™ m not sure there are a lot of voters that make a choice to vote for a candidate based on their vice - president , â€ � Murphy said .
This article was amended on 30 April to reflect that Paul Begala is a consultant and adviser to Priorities USA Action , not its director ."
2016-04-30,"The only thing that can save the Republican party from a Donald Trump takeover is Indiana .
On the heels of Trumpâ€ ™ s resounding win in five states on Tuesday night , anti - Trump Republicans need Ted Cruz to take the Hoosier State to stop the frontrunner from accumulating the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and avoid a contested convention this summer .
There are now just 10 states left in the Republican primaries , five of them voting on the final critical night of Tuesday 7 June .
Of the five states going to the polls in May , Indiana has the biggest delegate haul .
Indianaâ€ ™ s
demographics make it appealing to both Trump and Cruz .
Its industrial north - west borders Chicago , and as in parts of Illinois manufacturing jobs have slowly disappeared over the past 30 years .
In the largest city in the region , Gary , nearly 20 % of the population did not have a high school diploma or GED in 2010 .
In southern Indiana , conservative politics dominate , and the legacy of â€œCopperheadsâ€ � â€ “ Indianans who fought for or sympathized with the Confederacy â€ “ is still felt around the region .
Trump may also face awkward questions about his personal legacy in the state .
The businessman once owned a riverboat casino in Gary , an industrial town on Lake Michigan , and the region briefly viewed him as a potential economic savior .
He created some jobs with the casino , which he sold in 2005 , but never followed through on a promise to renovate a crumbling hotel in the cityâ€ ™ s downtown area .
â€œThere certainly have been some critical articles about Trumpâ€ ™ s business practices in the north - west part of the state , certainly with the casinos , â€ � said Tom Wheeler , a member of Cruzâ€ ™ s state team .
But he was not sure if that history would make a difference : â€œI donâ€ ™ t know how many people read that.â€ � Public polling in Indiana has Cruz about seven points behind Trump , 33 % to 40 % .
The third candidate in the race , John Kasich , accounts for roughly 20 % of the vote , despite a pact he made with Cruz to vacate the state in the hope of consolidating anti - Trump support .
The stakes in Indiana are so high that Cruz made a desperate gamble this week to lure conservatives away from Trump by declaring Carly Fiorina would be his running mate .
The announcement of a running mate nearly three months before the convention is unprecedented in modern US history and represents a throw of the dice to try to capture media attention and boost Cruz in the polls .
Trump isnâ€ ™ t taking a victory lap .
On Wednesday , at a rally in Indianapolis , he rolled out the endorsement of Bobby Knight , the beloved but controversial former coach of the Indiana University basketball team .
The coach of three national championship teams , Knight became nearly as famous for his violent outbursts as his coaching : he was fired amid allegations of assault and once threw a chair on to the court in the middle of a game .
Trump basked in this endorsement from â€œa winnerâ€ � and dismissed Cruz .
â€œCruz canâ€ ™ t win
, whatâ€ ™ s he doing picking a vice - president?â€ �
Trump asked a crowd of several thousand .
â€œOn television they say he has no path to victory .
Heâ€
™ s mathematically eliminated.â€
�
Without much of a choice , the Texas senator has embraced the role of David to Trumpâ€ ™ s Goliath .
On Tuesday night , he held a rally in the high school gym where the basketball movie Hoosiers was filmed , and Cruz cast himself as a scrappy underdog who overcomes huge odds .
â€œThat basketball ring here in Indiana is the same height as it is in New York City , â€ � he said , incorrectly quoting an inspirational line about basketball hoops from the film .
Cruz blamed the media for promoting Trump and felt confident that beginning in Indiana , â€œthis campaign moves back towards more favorable terrainâ€ � .
He tried to lump Trump with Hillary Clinton , calling them â€œNew York liberal[s]â€ � who believe â€œgrown men should use the little girlsâ€ ™ restroomâ€ � , an allusion to a controversial North Carolina law that overturns rules about discrimination against transgender people .
Anti -
Trump Republicans have questioned the businessmanâ€ ™ s conservative beliefs for months , to little avail , but Cruz is hoping that Indiana is conservative enough to make the strategy work .
In 2012 voters there elected a Tea Party challenger over a six - term senator , in part because of a push from the partyâ€ ™ s right wing , and pro - Cruz forces are hoping to rekindle that spirit .
They have combined to spend over $ 4 m on ads against Trump , compared to $ 960,000 spent by the frontrunner on television ads .
Pressure by anti -
Trump forces led the stateâ€ ™ s governor , Mike Pence , to endorse the Texas senator on Friday , albeit with little enthusiasm .
In a radio interview , Pence said : â€œIâ€ ™ m not against anybody , but I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the Republican primary.â€ �
Facing his own re - election bid in November , Pence took pains to make positive comments about Cruzâ€ ™ s top rival .
â€œI particularly want to commend Donald Trump ,
â€ �
Pence said .
He singled out the frontrunner highlighting the decision of air conditioning manufacturer Carrier to move jobs from Indiana to Mexico.â€ � â€œIndiana is crucial to the outcome of the race , â€ �
David McIntosh , the president of a major conservative political action committee , Club for Growth , told the Guardian .
A former Indiana congressman , McIntosh said the primary has â€œconsolidated into a two - man race .
That gives Cruz a very good chance to win it.â€ �
In McIntoshâ€ ™ s view , the candidates need two steps â€ “ victories in Indiana and California â€ “ to have any chance at the nomination .
â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s claim to be a winner
just isnâ€
™ t true , heâ€ ™ s got 35 - 40%â€ � of the vote , he said .
â€œTrump needs to win Indiana to nail it down on the first ballot.â€ � A leader in the Republican cause against Trump , Club for Growth has also been running anti - Kasich ads in Indiana since before the Cruz - Kasich pact .
The group argues that a vote for Kasich is a vote for Trump , and said it would â€œcontinue to be making that
pointâ€ �
while also criticizing Trump for â€œnot being a conservativeâ€ � ."
2016-05-01,"Ted Cruz made a last - ditch series of attacks on Donald Trump on Sunday , going so far as to call him corrupt , dismiss fellow Republicans , and invoke Trumpâ€ ™ s endorsement by â€œa convicted rapistâ€ � as he argued that his chances are not in fact dwindling in the Republican presidential primary .
Cruz blitzed television airwaves on Sunday morning , making appearances on five talkshows and doing everything in his power to undermine Trump .
He admitted Indiana was â€œimportantâ€ � to his campaignâ€ ™
s hopes , but doggedly refused to consider the possibility that Trump could secure the nomination .
â€œNo one is going to clinch it on the first ballot .
Iâ€ ™ m not and Donald Trump is not either ,
â€ �
he told the ABC show This Week .
â€œItâ€ ™ s why Donald Trump is so desperate to say itâ€ ™ s over now , â€ � he added .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to be a contested convention.â€
�
But a new opinion poll published on Sunday suggested Cruz is the candidate in dire need of a boost .
The NBC / Wall Street Journal /
Marist poll showed him behind Trump in Indiana by 15 points , 49 % to 34 % , with 13 % for Ohio governor John Kasich , the third candidate in the race .
Poll averages show Trump ahead of Cruz by seven points in the state , which is one of the few yet to vote that could keep Trump from clinching the nomination .
The stakes are high for Cruz .
The senator is already mathematically unable to secure 1,237 delegates needed on the first ballot of the Republican convention , and all his hopes rest on preventing Trump from doing the same .
Trump needs 282 pledged delegates , and Indiana and California are the two major states where Cruz has any hope of a major victory .
The math did not deter Cruz from trying every rhetorical tool at hand to counter Trump .
He insisted that the businessman is a liberal , and â€œflip - sides of the same coinâ€ � with the Democratic frontrunner , Hillary Clinton .
Trumpâ€ ™ s tariff proposals would â€œdrive jobs overseasâ€
�
, Cruz argued to NBC , adding that Trumpâ€ ™ s foreign policy would leave the world without leadership .
Not content to criticize the substance of Trumpâ€ ™ s ideas , he accused Trump and Clinton of being agents of a corrupt system .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ve both gotten rich exploiting Washington , exploiting government power , â€ �
he said on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press .
On two other shows , he called the pair â€œenmeshed in corruptionâ€ � , â€œultimate Washington
insidersâ€ � and members of a political â€œcartelâ€
� .
He also abandoned the appeals to unity that he had tried to make in hopes of bringing moderate conservatives to his cause .
He pointedly dismissed criticisms from other Republicans , namely from John Boehner , a longtime Republican leader and former speaker of the House , who earlier this week said Cruz was â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � . â€œI kind of wondered if Boehner was auditioning to be Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s vice - president , â€ �
Cruz told CBS .
â€œYou know , a Trump - Boehner ticket would really say the Washington cartel in all its force.â€ �
He was bolstered by at least one peer , however :
South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham , who readily admitted that â€œcivil warâ€ � had broken out in the Republican party .
â€œLucifer may be the only person Donald Trump could beat in a general election , â€ � he joked to CBS .
â€œBut when it comes women and Hispanics , Trump polls like Lucifer.â€
�
But Graham grew serious when asked about Trumpâ€ ™ s foreign policy , which he described as dangerous isolationism : â€œIt will lead to another 9/11.â€ �
Finally , Cruz rebuked the businessman for the company he keeps .
He noted that former boxer Mike Tyson had endorsed Trump this week , and alluded to Tysonâ€ ™ s 1992 rape conviction in Indiana .
â€œYou know , all the tough guys endorse me ,
â€ �
Trump said earlier this week .
â€œI like that.â€
�
Cruz rejected the endorsement : â€œI donâ€ ™ t think rapists are tough guys .
I think they are weak .
Theyâ€ ™ re bullies and cowards .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need a bully , â€ � he added .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need someone who yells and screams and insults.â€ � Campaigning in Indiana , Trump waved off the criticisms as annoyances , and mocked the men and Kasich at length .
â€œI refuse to call them the leftovers .
Itâ€ ™ s not respectful , â€ � he said , before miming the look of a man clinging to the edge of a cliff .
â€œThe two guys that are hanging by their fingernails .
â€˜Donâ€
™ t let me fall !
Donâ€ ™ t let me fall!â€ ™ â€ �
At a rally in Terre Haute , he said that he was already looking forward to the general election .
â€œIf we win in Indiana , itâ€ ™ s all over , â€ � he promised .
â€œAnd then we can focus on â€˜Crooked Hillaryâ€ ™ , please.â€ �
Earlier in the day , Trump did just that , telling Fox News Sunday that Clinton was playing â€œthe woman cardâ€ � and that â€œeven women donâ€ ™ t like herâ€ � .
He has for months accused Clinton of being a novelty candidate , although polling consistently shows that he is strongly disliked by most American women .
And although Cruz recited a litany of attacks on Trump , he refused to say he would not support the businessman should Trump win the nomination .
NBC host Chuck Todd asked Cruz nine times whether he could conceivably support Trump .
The senator spoke at length in reply , but did not give a simple yes or no ."
2016-05-01,"Sanders is taking questions from the press .
â€œThe ideas we are fighting for are the future of the Democratic party and indeed the future of this country , â€ � Bernie Sanders tells reporters at the National Press Club in Washington DC .
He mentions climate change , â€œgrotesqueâ€ � wealth inequality , reforming taxes for corporations and the richest Americans , education and healthcare â€ “ the many progressive issues of his campaign .
Then he talks about delegate math .
A Democratic candidate needs 2,083 â€œIt is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of delegates by June 14 , that is the last day a primary will be held , â€ � he says , â€œwith pledged delegates alone .
She will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia.â€ � â€œIn other words the convention will be a contested contest.â€
�
â€œThere are 10 states remaining where weâ€ ™ re going to be vigorously competing , â€ � he adds , plus several territories .
He says he needs 65 % of the remaining delegates to win .
We intend to fight for every vote in front of us and every vote remaining.â€
�
He then talks about superdelegates : â€œObviously we are taking on virtually the entire Democratic establishment.â€ �
Of the 719 superdelegates , he says , many committed themselves to Clinton before the campaign began a year ago .
â€œWhile we have won 45 % of the pledged delegates in real campaigns where the people have spoken , â€ � he says , â€œwe have won only 7 % of the superdelegates.â€ � â€œThose superdelegates where states where either candidate has won a landslide victories , those superdelegates ought to seriously reflect on whether they ought to cast their superdelegate vote in align[ment ] with the wishes of the people of those states.â€ �
Secondly , he says , he and Clinton disagree on many things : trade , breaking up banks , the rate of minimum wage hikes , a carbon tax , fracking , etc .
â€œBut where Secretary Clinton and I strongly agree , and where every delegate to the Democratic convention strongly agrees , is that it would be a disaster to this country if Donald Trump or some other rightwing Republican were to become president of the United States.â€
�
He spins this call to unity into an argument that he â€œstands the better chance of defeating Donald Trump and other Republican candidatesâ€ � .
Bernie Sanders is due to speak in Washington DC in the next few minutes , a year on from his campaign announcement .
My colleague Dan Roberts is reporting from the scene .
â€œIf we win in Indiana , itâ€ ™ s all over ,
â€ �
Trump promises .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to get there anyway .
And then we can focus on Crooked Hillary , please , letâ€ ™ s focus on Hillary.â€ �
He goes on for a bit about the delegate system
â€ “ he needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination .
He says heâ€ ™ ll have â€œfive , six million more votesâ€ � than Ted Cruz or John Kasich , and â€œlike five or six hundred delegates moreâ€ � .
â€œBecause there was 17 people you couldnâ€ ™ t get [ to 1,237 because ] there was all those early states ,
â€ �
Trump says .
But none of it matters : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t play the second ballot game , weâ€ ™ re only playing to win.â€
�
Then he ridicules Cruz a little more .
â€œThe first time in the history of politics that a man who can not win because he has no path , â€ �
Trump says , â€œand
heâ€ ™ s choosing a vice president.â€ � â€œHe has no path to victory!â€ �
He also says that he wants to get to general election business .
â€œWe want to raise money for the party , â€ � he says , alluding to those looming Senate and House races that have moderate Republicans terrified of losing their seat .
Heâ€
™ d rather do that â€œinstead of wasting our timeâ€ � .
You donâ€ ™ t have to be a good student ,
â€ �
Trump tells the crowd .
â€œYou donâ€ ™ t even have to be smart .
It doesnâ€
™ t help
us.â€
�
Then he talks about how much heâ€ ™ s won , eg â€œI won with women !
I won big!â€
�
Stat guru Harry Enten , of FiveThirtyEight , notes that Trump is not really winning in the polls outside of the Republican primary .
But Trump is enjoying talking , not reading Harryâ€ ™ s tweets .
He says heâ€ ™ s really glad to have the endorsement of businessman Carl Icahn and Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions .
â€œEven
I was surprised!â€
�
â€œI watched Lindsey Graham on television this morning ,
â€ �
Trump continues , before he loses his train of thought .
He says heâ€ ™ s knocked 17 rivals out of the race , except for two . â€œTheyâ€ ™ re like hanging by their fingertips.â€ �
Then he mocks Ted Cruz for announcing that former HP CEO Carly Fiorina would be his running - mate .
â€œLet me choose Carly , maybe that will turn it around , â€ �
Trump says .
Itâ€ ™ s much more impressive , according to the businessman , to have an endorsement from Bobby Knight , the college basketball coach as legendary for his violent outbursts ( and alleged assaults on players ) as his winning teams .
Then heâ€ ™ s back onto Cruz and the third candidate in the race , John Kasich .
â€œI refuse to call them the leftovers , itâ€ ™ s not respectful , â€ �
Trump says , not refusing at all .
He flails his arms and turns his ovoice into a whine : â€œThe two guys that are hanging by their fingernails .
â€˜Donâ€
™ t let me fall !
Donâ€ ™ t let me fall!â€ ™ â€ �
â€œAnd then , â€ � he growls into the mic , â€œwe go after â€˜Crooked Hillary ,
â€ ™ folks!â€ �
Donald Trump is speaking in Terre Haute , Indiana , and the rally is off to its typical rambling start .
He talks about how he gets â€œgreat ratingsâ€
� for the cable shows ,
even though heâ€ ™ s only been on one such show in several weeks .
He says the press are â€œextremely dishonest peopleâ€ � .
He talks about how he went to California on Friday and spoke for thousands of people .
He talks about protests against him , but he doesnâ€ ™ t call them protests : â€œthese thugs were jumping onto these cars.â€ � â€œThese guys should be put in jail for five years theyâ€ ™ ll never do it again
I promise.â€
�
He loves the police , by the way , has he mentioned that ?
Beautiful police .
He says business executives and foreign leaders â€œare like grand chessmastersâ€ � while in the US â€œweâ€ ™ re like checker playersâ€ � .
He segues from our â€œstupidâ€ � leadersâ€ ™ concern about global warming to talk about a kind of global warming that he does fear , â€œitâ€ ™ s made of the nuclear variety , thatâ€ ™ s the one we have to be careful of.â€
�
The audience doesnâ€ ™ t sound like itâ€ ™
s sure how to react to this , since itâ€ ™ s not clear what nuclear global warming is .
He doesnâ€ ™ t mention it now , but Trump has also previously suggested it would be a good idea to let South Korea , Japan and other nations develop their own nuclear weapons , even though he fears â€œthe nuclearâ€ � more than anything else .
â€œIâ€ ™ m worried about one thing : America first , weâ€ ™ re going to put America first.â€ �
America First was a non - interventionist movement led , in part , by famous aviator Charles Lindbergh in the years before World War II .
Lindberg was such an admirer of Adolf Hitlerâ€ ™ s Nazi regime in Berlin that before the war broke out he intended to move there .
Donald Trump does not appear to know anything about Charles Lindbergh or the historical antecedents of the phrase â€œAmerica firstâ€ � .
He also spoke a bit about football .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s son Eric vowed that he and his father will get the last laugh , after Barack Obama cracked a string of jokes at the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s expense on Saturday night .
Per the Hill : â€œWeâ€ ™ ll take some shots back next year .
He who laughs last laughs longest ,
right?â€ �
Trump said to The Hill in the reception area before the annual dinner event .
â€œIâ€ ™ d be shocked if [ Obama ] didnâ€ ™ t [ take shots at Donald],â€ �
Eric Trumpâ€ ™ s wife , Lara Yunaska , said .
Eric Trump , the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at The Trump Organization , seemed excited for his first visit to the soiree .
â€œI build hotels , â€ � said Trump .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t do politics .
This is uncharted territory to me.â€
�
The artist of a nude painting of Donald Trump says she was punched by a Trump supporter in Los Angeles and filed a police report .
She has previously said that she was threatened with legal action over the painting , which is not anatomically charitable to the Republican frontrunner .
The Los Angeles Police Department did not immediately confirm to the Guardian whether a police report was filed , and the artist did not answer a phone number listed to her name .
From Illma Goreâ€ ™ s Instagram post .
Today I was punched in the face by a man who got out of his car and yelled , â€œTrump 2016!â€ � in Los Angeles , just days after I returned home from London just down the road from my house .
Though I encourage passion , opinion and emotion , especially though art , I think violence is disgusting .
To live in a place where Facebook has given my address to an anonymous third party makes me feel like I am homeless again .
This type of violence makes creatives feel like we live in a world where our individual creative input isnâ€ ™ t safe .
I am sad that this is the state of our America right now .
I am sad that Trump , and many of his supporters , donâ€ ™ t find words enough to express their opinions - they need walls , waterboarding and punches.@realdonaldtrump Please stop glamorizing and perpetuating violence .
Make America Decent Again!#makeamericadecentagain
No , they have not been caught , and the men drove off laughing .
A detailed police report has been filed .
The Republican frontrunner did not spend his morning facing a carousel of journalists , but he did use campaign time to watch the shows anyway .
Far away , from the East Wing of the White House , an update on the first familyâ€ ™ s plans for when theyâ€ ™ re well away from politics .
Senator Lindsey Graham , a former presidential candidate and one of the most vocal anti - Trump Republicans , is next on the CBS program .
He minces no words : â€œLucifer is the only person Trump could beat in a general election.â€ �
Graham now supports Ted Cruz , though he once compared the choice between Trump and Cruz to â€œbeing shot or poisonedâ€ � .
â€œTrumpism will get creamed in the ballot box ,
â€ � Graham says .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a civil war going on in the Republican party , I hope and pray that Ted Cruz , whoâ€ ™ s a reliable conservative , can carry the banner.â€ �
Graham defines Trumpism as a â€œcult of a strongman that absolutely is nowhere near conservatismâ€ � .
The senator describes Trumpâ€ ™ s plan to deport 11 million undocumented people as â€œunworkable and hatefulâ€ � and his foreign policy as â€œthe siren song of isolationismâ€ � .
Graham sits on the Senateâ€ ™ s committee of foreign relations and says that Trumpâ€ ™ s foreign policy ideas ignore past mistakes by the US .
He says Japan and South Korea are not â€œfreeridersâ€ � but â€œvaluable alliesâ€ � , that â€œglobalization is here to stayâ€ � , and that the US needs Muslim Americans and partners abroad to fight terrorism .
â€œOur failure was not to follow throughâ€ � in Libya and Iraq , Graham argues , blaming the president for withdrawing forces from the latter .
He ends with a desperate plea to his colleagues in Republican politics : reject Trump , be your own person , get as far away as possible or lose your seat in Congress .
Bernie Sanders is appearing on CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation , with host John Dickerson .
Dickerson asks whether Sanders has any realistic chance left to win the nomination â€œItâ€ ™ s difficult , itâ€ ™ s not impossible , â€ � Sanders insists .
He says his campaign needs 65 % of the remaining delegates .
â€œCalifornia happens to be perhaps the most progressive state in this country , they have the most delegates.â€ � California votes on 7 June .
Sanders repeats a familiar argument that heâ€ ™ s best placed to defeat Donald Trump .
If the Democrats want to win in November , he says , hinting toward superdelegats , â€œif
they want the campaign that has the energy , the excitement , the young people , â€ �
then they should be turning to team Sanders .
He says that superdelegates , aka party officials who are free to vote as they please in the partyâ€ ™ s convention , are not inherently unfair .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s unfair is even before I get into the campaign Hillray Clinton has some four , five hundred superdelegates on her side.â€
�
Then he starts talking about bigger ambitions â€ “ an echo of last week , when he said his campaign is â€œthe future of the Democratic partyâ€ � , and a departure from his many vows to win the nomination .
Sanders maintains that he is the candidate representing working people , but argues that his underdog campaign is doing a net good for Democrats by continuing its fight with Hillary Clinton .
â€œI believe that it is good for American democracy when we have a vigorous debate on the issues , and I believe that it is good for the Democratic party when we have a vigorous debate on the issues , â€ � he says .
He assures Dickerson that his supporters will come into the eventual fold :
â€œof course the party needs to be unified and it will be unified after the convention in July.â€ �
But he also asserts that â€œlooking at the status quo , â€ � the American people are dissatisfied .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re looking at the nation , and theyâ€ ™ re saying as a nation we can do much better , and we can have real change.â€
�
Finally Todd gets round to asking Cruz a perennially awkward question : after all this talk bashing Donald Trump , would you support him if heâ€ ™ s the nominee ?
Cruz makes a familiar dodge : â€œI believe if the Republican Party nominates Donald Trump we will lose to Hillary , because when we offer Democrat - lite.â€ �
Todd :
All right .
All right .
All right .
Can you support him ?
He tries hard to just get a yes or no out of Cruz .
He points out itâ€ ™ s about votes and delegates , not â€œthe mediaâ€ � , and that it doesnâ€ ™ t matter whether Cruz can beat Hillary Clinton if he canâ€ ™ t beat Trump .
â€œRepublican voters are the ones rejecting you , â€ �
Todd says .
â€œThis is not a media conspiracy , senator .
The senator suggests maybe it is a conspiracy .
â€œWith all due respect , the media has given $ 2bn of free advertising to Donald .
Well , let me ask you a question , for example .
How much money did the networks make on every one of the Republican debates?â€ �
Todd has no idea , because he doesnâ€ ™ t run the business side of NBC , which didnâ€ ™ t air a Republican debate , much less boss of the other networks that aired debates .
â€œWhy
wonâ€
™ t you answer that question â€ “ black â€ “ straightforward , black and white?â€
�
Cruz doesnâ€ ™ t give up : â€œyour
networkâ€
™ s
executives are partisan Democrats , â€ � he says , without any evidence to support the generalization .
â€œThe simple reality is the media , almost entirely , are liberal , partisan , Democrats .
That is the reality of it .
The media created this Trump phenomenon , and then â€ “ and then they donâ€ ™ t hold him accountable .
Now , Iâ€ ™ m sure the media plan to do so if heâ€ ™ s the nominee in the general election .
â€œSuddenly youâ€ ™ re gon na hear every day about Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s tax returns .
When was the last time you talked about his tax returns ?
You--
you know , we ought to have a debate .
There are real differences .
Donald wonâ€ ™ t debate and the media wonâ€ ™ t hold him accountable .
I think the people of Indiana deserve a debateâ€ ¦ â€ � The verbal contortions are extraordinary .
He jumps from one diversionary talking point â€ “ the media , debates , etc â€ “ to another .
â€œListen , this is my kidsâ€ ™ future , Chuck .
Itâ€ ™ s not â€ “
itâ€ ™ s not simply a game
, â€ � he says .
Todd : â€œNobodyâ€ ™ s saying itâ€ ™ s
a game.â€ � Cruz says that â€œif we lose this we lose our country.â€
�
Even though Todd points out that Republican voters are rejecting him for Donald Trump and even John Kasich , he refuses to conceive of a United States that does not want Ted Cruz .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not willing to give up on America.â€ �
Todd : â€œSo let the record show , you have not taken a position on whether Trump-- whether you can support Trump if heâ€
™ s the nominee .
Fair enough?â€ �
He asked him nine times .
Cruz did not answer .
Then Todd asks Cruz about comments by the former Republican Speaker of the House , John Boehner , who this week called Cruz â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � and the most â€œmiserable son of a bitchâ€ �
he ever worked with .
Cruz claims he doesnâ€
™ t know John Boehner , even though Boehner led the Republican party in Congress for years while Cruz served in the Senate , and , as third in line to the presidency , was an extremely important person for anyone in Washington DC to know .
â€œNumber one , I donâ€
™ t know John Boehner .
The two of us havenâ€
™ t said 50 words to each other in our entire lives.â€ �
What ?
Cruz engineered a government shutdown that Boehner helped leadâ€ ¦
â€œItâ€ ™ s actually a good illustration , â€ � Cruz claims .
He says he asked Senator Mike Lee and Beohner to join him , and â€ “ according to Cruz â€ “ Boehner said , â€œNo interest .
No value .
Iâ€ ™ m not willing to talk to you.â€
� â€œSo I donâ€
™ t know him at all .
But what was interesting about Boehnerâ€ ™ s comments is he praised Hillary Clinton .
He thinks sheâ€ ™ s terrific.â€ � Boehner and Clinton and Trump â€œare the Washington cartel .
It is the corruption of Washington , â€ � Cruz says .
He keeps developing this conspiratorial theory .
â€œDonald and Hillary are the ultimate Washington insiders .
They have been enmeshed in the corruption .
If you like John Boehner , if you want a presidential candidate like John Boehner , then Donald Trump is your candidate.â€
�
He thinks Boehner â€œwas auditioningâ€ � to be Trumpâ€ ™ s vice - president â€ “ an unlikely move for a man who appeared in a comedic skit with Barack Obama last night .
Todd presses Cruz on the point , noting that taxes on the wealthiest have gone up , and so have jobs .
â€œHow do you explain that?â€ �
Cruz says heâ€ ™ s wrong , even though the US has consistently surpassed expectations regarding unemployment in recent years .
â€œJob creation has not gone up , Chuck .
We have the lowest percentage of Americans working of any year since 1977 .
The Obama - Clinton economy is a disasterâ€ ¦
â€ �
Todd checks him :
â€œweâ€ ™ re in a six - year expansion right now.â€
�
Well , itâ€ ™ s pretty slow , Cruz tries .
â€œMillions of Americans are hurting .
Income inequality has increased dramatically .
Now , you know who is doing well ?
The rich .
The Obama - Clinton economy has been very good for the Donald Trumps and Hillary Clintons of the world.â€ �
Then Cruz , who himself is a millionaire and married to an executive at Goldman Sachs , tries on a populist costume .
â€œThe top 1 % today earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.â€ � â€œIf you go to our rallies , if you see whoâ€ ™ s cominâ€ ™ out , itâ€ ™ s the single mom .
Itâ€ ™ s the steel worker .
Itâ€ ™ s the truck driver .
Itâ€ ™ s the student .
Itâ€ ™ s Hispanics .
Itâ€ ™ s the people who are struggling to climb the economic ladder , who Washington ignores .
Thatâ€ ™ s who we need to be fighting for .
I recognize that Wall Street and the lobbyists in K Street are doinâ€ ™ great under big government .
But the rest of America is being ignored by Washington.â€ � Todd changes subject .
He notes that Cruzâ€ ™ s new running - mate , Carly Fiorina , was not so long ago saying â€œTed Cruz is like any other
politicianâ€ � who â€œsays whatever he needs to say to get elected , and
then heâ€ ™ s gon na do as he pleases.â€
�
Cruz says it was all in good spirit back when Fiorina was his adversary in the Republican primary .
Sheâ€ ™ s endorsed him for a full seven weeks
â€ “ might as well be years .
Then he touts her business experience .
She had a controversial and short tenure at the head of Hewlett Packard , but Cruz doesnâ€ ™ t mention that .
â€œWith Carly itâ€ ™ s the complete package .
I was looking for someone who could be a partner .
You know , Iâ€ ™ ve never understood people who just want a ceremonial vice president.â€ �
Todd tries something a little more direct .
He asks Cruz whether heâ€ ™ s brought on Fiorina as a means of winning over women who object to Trumpâ€ ™ s objectifying and derogatory language about women .
Cruz takes the bait .
He points out that Trump is endorsed by former boxer Mike Tyson , whom Cruz describes as â€œa convicted rapist who served three years in prison here in Indiana for rapeâ€ � .
â€œYou know what , Chuck ?
I donâ€
™ t think rapists are tough guys .
I think theyâ€ ™ re weak , I think theyâ€ ™ re bullies , I think theyâ€ ™ re cowards .
And it says something if Donald Trump thinks that a convicted rapist a tough guy .
â€œHeâ€
™ s proud of Mike Tysonâ€ ™ s support , Iâ€ ™ m proud of Carly Fiorina and , and Mike Penceâ€ ™ s support .
And that is as clear a contrast for the people of Indiana and the people of this country as you could ask for.â€ �
Todd follows up , asking what Cruz makeâ€ ™ s of Trumpâ€ ™ s comment that Hillary Clinton is playing â€œthe woman cardâ€
� .
â€œItâ€
™ s
typical Donald Trump , â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œThe only thing he knows how to do in any given circumstance is he yells , he screams , he curses , or he insults .
So there heâ€ ™ s insulting Hillary .
Listen , Hillary is a very smart , committed liberal .
Her policies are profoundly wrong .
The he says Trump secretly supports her policies : â€œDonald and Hillary , theyâ€ ™ re flipsides of the same coin .
Theyâ€ ™ ve both gotten rich exploiting Washington , exploiting government power.â€ �
Ted Cruz is now on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press , where host Chuck Todd asks him about his somewhat dubious ability to unify Republicans .
Cruz says that thatâ€ ™ s exactly what heâ€ ™ s doing , saying that even though Donald Trump won five large states in the north - east last week , he himself won five ( much smaller ) states in the weeks before , out west .
Then he touts his new runningmate , Carly Fiorina , and an endorsement of Indianaâ€ ™ s governor , Mike Pence , â€œa strong , principled conservativeâ€ � .
â€œThat is really an illustration of how the party is coming together .
And I think the people of Indiana , the entire country is looking to Indiana .
And I think the country is really depending on Indiana , â€ � he says .
So how important is Indiana , Todd asks .
â€œIndiana is an important state , â€ �
Cruz replies .
â€œWe are competing hard .
Weâ€ ™ re barnstorming the state .
Weâ€ ™ re on a bus tour , Heidi and I and the girls and Carly.â€ � Todd :
So if Indiana rejects you , theyâ€ ™ re rejecting that argument , are they not ?
Cruz says he doesnâ€ ™ t think so .
He thinks his support â€œis surgingâ€ � .
He stumps a little about jobs and wages , and adds : â€œDonaldâ€ ™ s only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40 % tax hike of a giant tariff .
That would send us into a recession .
It would drive jobs overseas .
It would kill small businesses.â€
�
Then he compares himself to Ronald Reagan and JFK both , saying not entirely correctly that they cut taxes and lifted regulations on small business .
Wallace asks Trump about Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s mockery of him at the White House Correspondents Dinner .
The president joked at Trumpâ€ ™ s expense at length , including a quip that Trump would be great at shutting down GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
â€œTrump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.â€ � Trump didnâ€ ™ t mind Obamaâ€ ™ s jokes at all .
â€œI think
itâ€ ™ s
fine , itâ€ ™ s a comedy , itâ€ ™ s fine.â€ � â€œI guess Iâ€ ™ m good at something because Iâ€ ™ ve made more than $ 10bn
and I started with a $ 1 m loan.â€ �
Finally Wallace asks Trump about Indiana , the next state to vote .
Governor Mike Pence gave a lukewarm endorsement to Ted Cruz this week , and Cruz has tried to use boxer
Mike Tysonâ€
™ s support for Trump against him .
Trump doesnâ€ ™ t really care .
â€œI
havenâ€
™ t seen Mike in years , â€ � he says .
Cruz is â€œthe greatest liar that ever lived except he gets caught all the time.â€ � Wallace turns to foreign policy â€ “
Trump gave a speech this week billed as a detailed policy plan .
It was not entirely coherent .
The Fox News host asks Trump about his philosophy of â€œAmerica
firstâ€ � , a more isolationist stance toward the world that would concentrate on domestic spending and avoid intervention abroad .
He asks Trump whether he would prefer to keep autocratic strongmen , like Egyptâ€ ™ s ex - president Hosni Mubarak and Libyaâ€ ™ s Muammar Gaddafi , to the troubled revolutions that deposed those men .
Trump seems to conflate Mubarak with Gaddafi , and doesnâ€ ™ t mention Egypt , which is specifically what Wallace asked about .
â€œYou have a mess .
You have a big fat mess ,
â€ � he says .
â€œWhen you knock out Iraq youâ€ ™ re going to ruin the balance.â€ �
â€œWhat weâ€ ™ ve done in the Middle East , weâ€ ™ ve spent $ 4 trillion and weâ€ ™ re far worse than when the first gunshot was fired.â€ �
He gets back to domestic problems .
â€œWe have to rebuild our country .
Our country is becoming third world , â€ � he says , comparing Chinaâ€ ™ s trains that travel â€œ300mphâ€
� to American railroads .
â€œWe have the Long Island Railroad , and it can hardly â€ “ it can hardly move.â€
�
Wallace gets him back to foreign policy , but Trump quickly goes on a tangent : â€œIsis now has Libyan oil , you know itâ€ ™ s among the finest oil in the world
â€
¦
And if we wouldâ€ ™ ve left Gaddafi , we wouldnâ€ ™ t have had that.â€
�
Then he boasts about his lack of notable foreign policy advisors .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want the people thatâ€ ™ ve been involved for 15 years because those are the people what theyâ€ ™ ve absolutely done to this country , and
our country.â€ � Wallace :
So is it far to say that Hillary Clinton will be the hawk in this race and youâ€ ™ ll be the dove ?
â€œNo Iâ€ ™ ll tell you what I will be much tougher than her , I will have much more respect ,
â€ �
Trump insists , ignoring the point about intervention versus reputation .
He says heâ€ ™ s glad to hear that foreign leaders are a little alarmed about his success .
â€œLet them be a little concerned.â€ � â€œWeâ€ ™ re like the policemen to the world , whatâ€ ™ s going on is crazy.â€ �
Donald Trump is ending a long hiatus from the Sunday shows to appear on Fox News Sunday , with host Chris Wallace .
Itâ€ ™ s been almost a month since Trump appeared on any of the shows , which were long one of his favorite weekend activities .
Wallace asks about sometimes violent protests at Trump rallies , including in California on Friday .
â€œIt was like a love fest for an hour and a half , â€ �
Trump says of the California protests .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t even see the riots , you know these are wise guys that stomp on policemenâ€ ™ s cars.â€ �
Trump was forced from his motorcade by protesters at one point on Friday .
â€œThese were professional agitators , â€ �
he continues , alluding to protesters that night .
â€œThese people have to be dealt with very strongly because you canâ€ ™ t allow that to happen to a police car.â€ �
â€œBut this was an amazing evening , â€ � he insists .
â€œA record - setting crowd , and nobody even saw it.â€ �
Wallace points out the general election
is â€œa different dealâ€
�
â€ “ that Trump is hugely disliked by Hispanic Americans and women voters beyond the Republican primary .
â€œThose numbers are going way up once I start going .
I have two more people to get rid of ,
â€ � he says .
â€œOnce I start on Hillary youâ€ ™ ll see the numbers change.â€
�
He says his record of success in the Republican primary is a sign of how heâ€ ™ ll do in the future .
â€œOne by one I won .
Watch what happens with Hillary and watch what happens with my numbers.â€ �
He says heâ€
™ s been â€œhit with 55,000 negative adsâ€ � and hasnâ€ ™ t been affected .
What about Hillary Clinton , Wallace asks â€ “ a Fox News host defending her â€ “
she was a senator , she was secretary of state ,
â€œto say if she were a man she would get 5 % , isnâ€ ™ t that kind of dismissive?â€
�
â€œThe fact is the only card she has is the womanâ€ ™ s card ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œEven women donâ€ ™ t like her.â€ �
â€œI donâ€ ™ t think sheâ€ ™ ll play it well at all .
And itâ€ ™ s true .
If she were not a woman she wouldnâ€
™ t even be in this race.â€ �
Bernie Sanders has announced yet another extraordinary month of fundraising , raising $ 25.8 m in April .
The senator has routinely broke fundraising records with small donations , which he often touts on the campaign trail as a sign of his â€œpolitical revolutionâ€ � .
From the campaign : Since the Sanders campaign was launched one year ago , his supporters have revolutionized campaign fundraising and demonstrated that he can wage a competitive campaign for president without relying on Wall Street and other special interests .
More than 7.4 million contributions have poured in from more than 2.4 million donors totaling $ 210 million .
A key to Sandersâ€ ™ fundraising success has been that his grassroots supporters consistently have contributed more to his campaign than Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s big - dollar donors .
Sandersâ€ ™ April donations far exceeded Hillary for Americaâ€ ™ s $ 21 million in March .
â€œWhat our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the political process , â€ � said Jeff Weaver , Sandersâ€ ™ campaign manager .
â€œSanders is the candidate with the most energy and excitement .
He is the candidate with the best chance of winning in November .
He is the candidate who is in the best position to bring a new generation of voters into the democratic process and restore the faith of working - class voters that we can have a government that works for all of us , not just the 1 percent.â€ � Sandersâ€ ™ average contribution was a little less than $ 26 , the campaign said , boasting that teachers , students , engineers and young people make up the largest blocs of donors .
Itâ€ ™ s an implicit rebuke of Clinton , who has received a large number of contributions from people who work in finance , law or are retired .
Republican Ted Cruz is next up on the CNN program .
CcHost Jake Tapper immediately notes comments by former Speaker of the House John Boehner â€ “ Republicansâ€ ™ long - time leader in Congress .
Boehner said Cruz was â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � .
Cruz immediately notes how heâ€ ™ s gotten an endorsement from Indianaâ€ ™ s governor , Mike Pence , and his new running - mate Carly Fiorina .
He waxes grateful .
Tapper turns it on him :
doesnâ€ ™ t picking Fiorina this early , months before the convention and hundreds of delegates away from the nomination , smack of desperation ?
Cruz says thatâ€ ™ s exactly what Trump wants you to think .
â€œHe either yells , screams , curses or insults , so
itâ€
™ s no surprise he went with insult.â€
�
â€œThis is an unusual election
but I think
itâ€ ™ s important to give the voters a clear contrast , a clear choice , between Carly and me on the one hand and Donald and Hillaryâ€
� on the other , he says .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re flipsides of the same coin .
They agree with each other on issue after issue after issue , â€ �
Cruz goes on .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re both Washington insiders.â€ � â€œTrump has made billions buying politicians like Hillary Clinton , â€ �
he says , lumping in Boehner for good measure .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re all part of the same corrupt Washington system .
Where the rich get richer.â€
�
Cruzâ€ ™ s
new populist argument is a tricky one to make : he is a millionaire lawyer married to a Goldman Sachs financier and running for president alongside a millionaire former CEO .
Tapper then asks Cruz about his support for a North Carolina law that requires transgender people use the bathroom of the gender they were assigned at birth .
â€œThe law doesnâ€ ™ t specify transgender itâ€
™ s whatever you feel like at the given moment , â€ � Cruz says , arguing that although transgender people might not threaten children , the anti - discrimination rules that protect them could somehow leave children vulnerable to predators .
Hillary Clinton is the first candidate to speak this morning , on CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union with host Jake Tapper .
Itâ€ ™ s a pre - taped interview , the only one Clinton has given since her victory in four of five states that voted last Tuesday .
Do you consider yourself the presumptive nominee , sheâ€ ™ s asked .
â€œNo
, â€ � she says , adding that sheâ€ ™ s â€œon
the pathâ€ � and doesnâ€ ™ t want to take anything for granted .
Tapper then asks her about Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ turn toward changing the agenda of the democratic party , rather than winning the nomination outright .
â€œThere comes a time where you have to look at the reality , â€ � Clinton replies .
â€œI certainly look forward to working with Senator Sanders , â€ � she says , promising that â€œit will be a progressive platform.â€ � â€œI really welcome his ideas and his supportersâ€ ™ passion and commitment , because the most important thing for us is for us to win in November , â€ � she adds .
The â€œprimary objectiveâ€ � , she says , is â€œto make sure that Donald Trump is not president .
Clinton commiserates with Sanders and his supporters .
â€œItâ€ ™ s hard , â€ � she says .
â€œYou throw yourself into these campaigns body and soul , you work 24/7.â€
�
Then she essentially thanks Sanders for his contributions : bringing people into the party , and being â€œa passionate advocate for the issues he feels passionately aboutâ€ � .
â€œWe have far more in common , â€ �
she says , â€œthan Donald Trump.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s policy ideas are â€œdisturbingâ€ � , she says , noting his proposals to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US and to create a religious registry .
â€œI know that the stakes are high , that we face some real challenges and dangers in the world ,
â€ � she says , but â€œI donâ€ ™ t think pretending you have some kind of secret plan is a smart way of leading.â€ �
Asked about Trumpâ€ ™ s more isolationist tendencies , Clinton assures
Tapper : â€œIâ€ ™ m always someone who uses military force as a last resort.â€ �
Asked about some of Trumpâ€ ™
s remarks â€ “ about a â€œwoman cardâ€ � and â€œcrooked Hillaryâ€
�
â€ “
she says she doesnâ€
™ t respond to attacks .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s kind of silly , â€ � she adds , noting that sheâ€ ™ s been twice elected to the Senate , has two million more votes overall than Trump , and won Ohio and Pennsylvania by higher margins than he won in the Republican primary .
â€œI had a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and the way they speak , â€ �
she says .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not going to deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying.â€ � â€œI could [ sic ] really care less.â€
�
In a hint at some of her anti - Trump tactics to come , she notes that Trumpâ€ ™ s proposals are almost always extremely vague .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing secret about what I want to d , â€ � she says .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve laid it all out there .
And he canâ€ ™ t .
Or he wonâ€ ™ t .
I canâ€ ™ t tell which .
â€
¦
Or he can continue on his insult fest .
Thatâ€ ™ s a choice heâ€ ™ s
making.â€ �
Tapper turns to a bit of policy himself .
He asks about trade deals that Trump and Sanders have criticized at length for hurting manufacturing jobs .
â€œThey were mixed .
They helped a lot of people and they hurt people , â€ � Clinton says .
â€œOne of the problems in our country is we donâ€
™ t do enough to help people who are hurt.â€
�
Finally the host asks her about how she and her husband , former president Bill Clinton , attended the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump .
Clinton laughs , and grins when she says that it â€œnever crossed my mindâ€ � that she could ever be running for president against the businessman .
Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the 2016 primary election , the day after Barack Obama literally dropped the mic on Republicans , Democrats and the press , and only two days out from the crucial Indiana primary , which is likely the last realistic chance to block a former reality TV star from a clear path to his partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
Donald Trump needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination at the partyâ€ ™ s convention in July , and party leaders in New Hampshire and elsewhere are trying to pack their contingents with anti - Trump Republicans .
Trumpâ€ ™ s main rival , Texas senator Ted Cruz , has meanwhile invested huge efforts into Indiana , a state with politics so conservative that its voters may yet choose the widely loathed senator over the nationally disliked businessman .
Trump did not attend the White House correspondents dinner on Saturday night , although heâ€ ™ s been a guest before .
â€œIs this dinner too tacky for the Donald?â€ � Obama asked the crowd .
â€œWhat could he possibly be doing instead ?
Is he at home eating a Trump steak , tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel ?
Whatâ€ ™ s
he doing?â€
�
Polls suggest the race is close :
Cruzâ€ ™ s well - organized team has tended to over - perform in states such as Indiana , and the stateâ€ ™ s rules mean whoever wins takes most of the delegates .
Cruz himself will appear on nearly every Sunday talk show this morning to press his case that somehow he can be both Americaâ€ ™ s most conservative leader and a unifying , definitely - not - despised - by - colleagues force in American politics .
The Texas senator was not spared Obamaâ€ ™ s mockery , especially for his talk of a â€œbasketball ringâ€ � earlier this week .
â€œWhat else is in his lexicon ?
Baseball sticks ?
Football hats ?
But , sure , Iâ€ ™ m the foreign one.â€ �
Cruz is also hampered by John Kasich , a third Republican candidate who trails by a huge margin in the race and who has lured more moderate conservatives to his comparatively more moderate cause .
Without any realistic chance at the nomination , Kasich has largely been ignored by party leaders such as former House Speaker John Boehner and Senator Lindsey Graham .
This week Boehner called Cruz â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � .
On the Democratic side of the race , underdog Bernie Sanders has lost nearly any mathematical chance at the nomination in terms of pledged and unpledged delegates .
He has vowed to continue the race through its final stages , however , and already turned toward converting his remarkable success
â€
“
he often notes that he started a year ago at 3 % in the polls
â€ “ into a progressive agenda for the Democratic party at large .
Obama joked that the 74-year - old Sanders is â€œthe bright new face of the Democratic partyâ€ � .
â€œI am hurt , though , Bernie , that youâ€ ™ ve been distancing yourself a little from me .
I mean , thatâ€ ™ s just not something that you do to your comrade.â€
�
The democratic socialist senator from Vermont began his campaign exactly one year ago today ( May Day ) , and his mission may yet prove a defining factor even should the frontrunner secure the nomination , as seems likely .
That frontrunner , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton , has already turned her attention away from Sanders and toward Trump and the general election .
Clinton has given a rare exclusive interview to CNN this morning , and will likely have to field questions about her thoughts on a potential running mate , even though the party remains months from the convention .
Obama didnâ€ ™ t spare his erstwhile cabinet member from a little teasing , and alluded to her hard road ahead uniting Sandersâ€ ™ passionate base of young people .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got to admit it though , Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook .
â€œObama outâ€ �
, the president declared on Saturday night , at ease with his nearing departure from the White House .
Weâ€ ™ re in it for the long haul , so follow along to see how Trump , Cruz , Sanders and Clinton try to edge each other , redefine politics â€ “ and react to the presidential gibes at their expense ."
2016-05-02,"Politicians who run for president are used to scorn , mockery and a healthy skepticism from the American people .
But few have been heckled by a 12-year - old , questioned about their Canadian birth , or had their spouse field questions about their resemblance to a serial killer .
All in one day .
Ted Cruz suffered all this and more on Monday in Indiana , a state where he desperately needs to do well if he wants to preserve any hope of winning the Republican nomination for president .
Simple arithmetic eliminated Cruz from an outright victory two weeks ago , but he has clung to the possibility that he could deny Donald Trump the 1,237 delegates a candidate needs to win the primary election .
Indiana and California are the two largest states that could tilt the race in favor of a contested convention , in which Cruz would have a chance of beating Trump .
But Cruz , called â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � by one of his former colleagues in Congress last week , found little more love in Indiana than in Washington .
The trouble started with a 12-year - old in La Porte , Indiana .
At a rally there , a boy shouted â€œYou suck!â€ � and
â€œShut up!â€ � during Cruzâ€ ™ s
stump speech , thwarting the senatorâ€ ™ s attempts to turn the pubescent heckler into a talking point .
â€œYou know , one of the things that hopefully someone has told you is that children should speak with respect , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œImagine what a different world it would be if someone had told Donald Trump that , years ago.â€ �
Eventually he gave up , saying : â€œIn my household , when a child behaves that way they get a spanking.â€ �
Police escorted the boy away , shouts of â€œshut upâ€ � continuing .
Later , Cruz was confronted near his campaign bus by supporters of his rival , who gleefully shouted â€œLyinâ€ ™ Ted!â€ � at the senator from a few feet away , using Trumpâ€ ™ s preferred nickname for Cruz .
Trump has bestowed pet names on each of his rivals
â€ “ â€œLittle Marcoâ€ �
Rubio , â€œCrooked Hillaryâ€ � Clinton and â€œComradeâ€ � Bernie Sanders , for instance â€ “ and has reminded his fans repeatedly that Ted Cruz was recently a dual Canadian American citizen .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ll find out tomorrow , â€ � the Trump supporter said .
â€œIndiana donâ€ ™ t want you.â€ � The Princeton alumnus and champion debater tried to engage .
â€œThe question everyone here should ask ...
â€ �
â€œAre you Canadian?â€ �
the voter asked , to titters from the crowd .
Then : â€œWhereâ€ ™ s your Goldman Sachs jacket?â€ � an allusion to the employer of Cruzâ€ ™ s wife .
Always a lawyer â€ “ and one who has argued successfully before the supreme court â€ “ Cruz tried a different tack : an appeal to civility .
â€œIf
I were Donald Trump , I wouldnâ€ ™ t have come over to talk to you , â€ � he said .
â€œSir , America is a better country ...
â€ �
â€œWithout you!â€
�
â€œThank
you for those kind sentiments , â€ � he said .
â€œI respect your right to speak but Iâ€ ™ m also going to say in America we are a nation that is better than anger and insults and cursing and rage .
And I believe the people in Indiana have common sense and good judgement and want real solu
â€ “
â€ � â€œWoo !
Vote Trump !
Woo!â€ � the voter screamed , followed by others in the crowd .
Cruz spun on his heels and walked away .
Cruzâ€ ™ s allies did not have much a better day .
His wife , Heidi , was asked by Yahoo News to comment on a string of jokes at this weekendâ€ ™ s White House correspondents dinner , made at her husbandâ€ ™ s expense .
On Saturday , the comedian Larry Wilmore invoked an internet meme that pretends the senator is the Zodiac Killer , the enigmatic and never - captured murderer who puzzled authorities with coded notes and claimed to have killed several people in the late 1960s and early 70s .
â€œWell , Iâ€ ™ ve been married to him for 15 years
and I know pretty well who he is
, so it doesnâ€ ™ t bother me at all .
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of garbage out there , â€ � Heidi Cruz said .
Elsewhere , Cruzâ€ ™ s would - be running mate , Carly Fiorina , slipped off a stage at a rally as Cruz obliviously continued to shake supportersâ€ ™ hands .
Trump later commented :
â€œCruz didnâ€
™ t do anything ; even I would have helped her ...
That was a weird deal.â€
�
There was no report of any injury , but internet comedians quickly seized on her literal pratfall , as well as a strange , fumbling hand clasp she attempted with Cruz .
Nor could the Cruz campaign find any comfort in the polls .
Averages show Cruz tanking : down 14 points to Trump , while John Kasich hovers around 11 % , without enough support to make up for Cruzâ€ ™ s deficit even if all of Kasichâ€ ™ s voters suddenly defected to the Texan .
Trump needs about 45 % of the remaining delegates in order to reach 1,237 , CBS estimates â€ “ a viable possibility , considering his good chances in California , the state with the most delegates .
But Cruz insisted that even without Indiana , he â€œabsolutelyâ€ � had a path to the nomination , defying the cries of Trump supporters to â€œdo the mathâ€ � .
Nor do Americans in general seem to be taking a liking to Cruz , even though a recent Washington Post - ABC poll shows that 67 % of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Trump .
Fifty - three per cent of Americans dislike Cruz .
A March poll found that 52 % of Americans have unfavorable opinions of Hillary Clinton , the likely Democratic nominee .

North Carolina speaks"
2016-05-02,"Tuesdayâ€ ™ s Indiana primary will be one of the last chances for underdog candidates Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to upset the frontrunners and try to force a contested convention in the Republican and Democratic races for president .
Among Republicans , Cruz has gone all out in Indiana in recent weeks , virtually living in the Hoosier State as he tries to upset Donald Trump .
The senator from Texas has even taken the unprecedented step of announcing a vice - presidential candidate months away from the convention , picking former rival Carly Fiorina in an attempt to recapture momentum .
With the arcane system that Republicans use to determine their nominee , Indiana is vitally important .
If Trump wins the 30 delegates that Indiana awards to the winner of the stateâ€ ™ s popular vote â€ “ the winner of each of the stateâ€ ™ s nine congressional districts receives three delegates apiece â€ “ only a massive upset by Cruz in California could stop Trump from the 1,237 delegates he needs to win on the conventionâ€ ™ s first ballot .
Recent public polls show Trump with a solid lead over Cruz in the state , and one released by NBC and the Wall Street Journal on Sunday shows the frontrunner with a 15-point lead .
â€œIf we win in Indiana , itâ€ ™ s all over ,
â€ �
Trump promised a crowd on Sunday in Terra Haute , Indiana .
â€œAnd then we can focus on â€˜Crooked Hillaryâ€ ™ , please.â€ �
Cruz has campaigned doggedly through the state , nonetheless .
In a retail stop in Carmel , an Indianapolis suburb , on Monday , his allies besieged a local coffee shop .
Fiorina was joined by Cruzâ€ ™ s wife , Heidi , as well as Utah senator Mike Lee and Texas congressman Louie Gohmert , who all glad - handed every Indianan they could find in the room .
With the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s position looking increasingly beleaguered , his wife and Fiorina could be overheard taking jibes at the press as they thanked voters for their prayers on Cruzâ€
™ s behalf .
Gohmert , a longtime supporter , expressed his wonderment that â€œthe most dishonest man in the race calls the most honest man â€˜Lyinâ€ ™ â€ � .
In the meantime , Trump dismissed both Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich , a third candidate , as â€œthe leftoversâ€ � , and waxed confident that he would be the nominee .
The frontrunner also added a new wrinkle to fiery protectionist rhetoric on Sunday , telling a crowd in Fort Wayne : â€œWe canâ€ ™ t continue to allow China to rape our country.â€ �
On the Democratic side , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is hoping for an upset in a state where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead .
â€œWe always thought Indiana was a state that would absolutely be willing to listen to this message , â€ �
Pete Dâ€ ™ Alessandro , a top Sanders operative who is overseeing his efforts in Indiana , told the Guardian , â€œbecause Nafta and these terrible trade agreements have just devastated the state over the past generation.â€ � Crediting a long active volunteer effort , he expressed confidence that Sanders will do well .
However , Sandersâ€ ™ fundraising has lagged compared to past months : he raised only $ 26 m in April , which was $ 20 m less than his March total .
He needs a big win to keep his hopes alive in the late stages of the primary , following big wins for Clinton in New York and other east coast states .
Although a win in Indiana for Sanders would likely only make a minimal difference in narrowing Clintonâ€ ™ s massive lead in delegates ( without counting the so - called â€œsuperdelegatesâ€
� , she currently leads Sanders by 327 pledged delegates , more than twice the final gap between her and Obama in 2008 ) , it would give him much - needed momentum as the arithmetic increasingly makes Clinton the prohibitive favorite to be the Democratic nominee ."
2016-05-02,"Did you get heckled by a preteen , told that an entire stateâ€ ™ s population â€œdonâ€ ™ t want you
, â€ � questioned about your citizenship and have your spouse grilled about whether you are actually a prominent serial killer who operated in northern California from 1968 to 1970 ?
If not , you had a better day than Texas senator Ted Cruz , whose attempts to win over last - minute undecided voters in Indiana were as awkward as his attempted handgrab with â€œrunning mateâ€ � Carly Fiorina : Less than 24 hours before voting begins in the Hoosier State , all eyes were on the Midwest today .
Here are some of the highlights from the campaign trail : Cruz said on Monday that he â€œabsolutelyâ€
� has a path to the nomination if he loses in Indiana , where the victor is expected to gather 40-some delegates .
If Donald Trump collects such a prize , he would need to grab about 45 % of the remaining pledged delegates to cross the line , very doable for him based on past performance .
( And Trump could still get to 1,237 without winning Indiana . )
The path Cruz sees to the nomination after an Indiana loss , in short , remains well - hidden to everyone else , and would seem to involve a sudden and drastic shift in momentum in the race of the kind thatâ€ ™ s difficult to imagine .
Hillary Clinton raised more money than Bernie Sanders last month for the first time in 2016 , according to end - of - month totals released by the campaigns .
Clinton reported a $ 26 m haul for April , while Sanders reportedly took in $ 25.8 m
â€ “ significantly down from his high - water - marks in February and March , when he took in $ 43.5 m and $ 44 m , respectively .
Asked to comment on the Internet joke pretending that Cruz is the Zodiac Killer , would - be first lady Heidi Cruz was unbothered .
â€œWell , Iâ€ ™ ve been married to him for 15 years and I know pretty well who he is
, so it doesnâ€ ™ t bother me at all .
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of garbage out there , â€ � Cruz said .

After touting tomorrowâ€ ™ s election as having â€œthe potential to change the direction of the Republican race , â€ � Hannity asked Trump via satellite why the most recent polls showing him beating Texas senator Ted Cruz in Indiana is â€œis
so important.â€

Carly Fiorina has sent out a fantasy - fueled email to supporters of Texas senator Ted Cruz after his terrible , horrible , no - good , very bad day , asking them to help fund his â€œsurgingâ€ � campaign ahead of tomorrowâ€ ™ s Republican primary in Indiana , emphasizing that he is â€œrunning neck and neck with Trump.â€ � â€œTedâ€ ™ s surging ahead of tomorrowâ€ ™ s Indiana primary - but we canâ€ ™ t win without your help right away , â€ � Fiorina writes .
â€œOn the ground , our crowds have been growing and our momentum has reached fever pitch.â€
� Sidenote :
A picture of the crowd at tonightâ€ ™ s Cruz rally tells a different story ... â€œRecent polls show us running neck and neck with Trump in Indiana ,

Fiorina continues , apparently using a definition of â€œneck - and - neckâ€ � with which we were previously unaware .
â€œThis is still anyoneâ€

race , â€ � Fiorina concludes .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re going to win we have to keep fighting as hard as possible , right down to the wire - and thatâ€ ™ s why Ted and I are counting on you right now.â€ �
A Freudian slip from senior Trump adviser Ed Brookover ?
Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s dim prospects ahead of the Indiana primary that he himself has called a bellweather for the Republican nomination has had a silver lining : Several within the Republican party have floated him as a potential replacement to fill the vacant seat on the supreme court .
But donâ€ ™ t count Donald Trump as one of the â€œJustice Cruzâ€ � enthusiasts .
In an interview with the Daily Mail , Trump said that â€œIâ€ ™ d have to think about it , â€ � when asked if he would name Cruz to fill the seat once occupied by conservative icon Antonin Scalia .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a whole question of uniting and thereâ€ ™ s a whole question as to temperament , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s certainly a smart guy , but thereâ€ ™ s also a temperament issue .
Heâ€
™ s got a tough temperament for what weâ€ ™ re talking about ; you have to be a very , very smart , rational person , in my opinion , to be a justice of any kind.â€ �
This does not bode well .
Political commentator and professional opinion - haver Bill Kristol has been one of the loudest voices of the # NeverTrump movement - although in an interview on Newsmax , Kristol indicated that â€œneverâ€ � basically means â€œÂ¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.â€ � When host Steve Malzberg asked Kristol whether there was anything that the billionaire Republican frontrunner could do to earn his support , Kristol said that
Trumpâ€ ™ s
character deficits were almost too high a barrier to clear .
â€œItâ€ ™ s more of a matter of character , and I donâ€ ™
t know that you can change your character at age 69,â€
� Kristol said .
â€œAnd given the things heâ€ ™ s said , even very recently , about other people , the way he demeans other people.â€ �
That all being said ...
â€œI mean , I guess never say never , â€ � he continued .
â€œOn the one hand , Iâ€ ™ ll say # NeverTrump , and on the other hand , Iâ€ ™ ll say , â€˜never say never.â€ ™ â€ � Conservative talk - radio host and would - be media titan Glenn Beck - remember him ? - has called on his supporters to join him â€œfor a day of prayers , fasting and humilityâ€ � for Texas senator Ted Cruz ahead of the Indiana Republican primary tomorrow .
In a long and meandering Facebook post , the onetime Fox News host asks his fans , â€œbeginning Monday night and running for 24 hours ending on Tuesday will you pray and if possible fast like you have never done before?â€ � ( All sic . )
â€œJoin me and my family in praying and fasting for our nation and our God to look down and forgive us of our misguided ways , â€ �
Beck continues in the post , with a sample prayer one might use in asking the almighty for guidance ahead of the nomination contest : â€œHelp us Lord to return to you and have the bravery to do the hard thing - to Trust in You and to do our part by standing firm in the eternal truths that Got us here in the first place.â€ �
Cruz currently lags behind billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump in every major poll of the Hoosier State .
On top of that , the Texas senator was today heckled by a child , quizzed about his birthplace and faced questions over whether heâ€ ™ s a serial killer .

The endorsement at the rally was paired with an online endorsement offered former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz , who said â€œthe main reason I am endorsing him is Iâ€ ™ ve played his golf course , Iâ€ ™ ve stayed in his hotels .
He does nothing but first class in everything .
He wants this country to be first class as well.â€ �
The two coaches , along with legendary Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight , give Trump a trifecta of endorsements from each of Indianaâ€ ™ s three major universities .
Trump though added to his celebrity glitter , throwing in an endorsement from former pro football player and actor Fred Williamson .
Williamson , nicknamed â€œthe Hammerâ€ � for his hard hits as a safety for the Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs , was praised by Trump , â€œI love people that hit hard.â€ � The newly minted Trump endorser , a native of Gary , Indiana , also had extensive acting career .
He starred in the blaxploitation classic Black Caesar and also appearing films ranging from M.A.S.H. to From Dusk
Till Dawn .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s nickname for â€œLyinâ€ ™ â€ �
Ted Cruz sometimes feels like itâ€ ™ s straight out of a schoolyard .
Now , the Texas senator is hitting back on the billionaire Republican frontrunner with an ad that responds :
â€œI know you are , but what am I?â€ �
In the ad , titled Lying , a narrator tells voters that â€œDonald Trump is lying about Ted Cruz , â€ � touting his opposition to trade deals and his against - it - after - he - was - for - it undermining of the Gang of Eight immigration bill while Trump donated to politicians of whom the gang was composed .
â€œTrump also had a $ 1 million judgment against him for hiring illegals , â€ �
the narrator states , referring to a 1980 lawsuit in which a contractor hired undocumented Polish workers to build his eponymous Midtown Manhattan corporate headquarters .
( Sidenote :
Although the lawsuit aimed for a $ 1 million settlement , the presiding judge ordered Trump to pay considerably less , and the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount . )
â€œTrump still brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans , â€ � the ad states , referring to a New York Times article that pointed out the high number of legal - status foreign workers at his Mar - a - Lago club in Palm Beach , Florida .
â€œWhat a phony.â€

It was bound to happen .
Brooklyn - accented Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been played by Seinfeld co - creator Larry David on Saturday Night Live for months , but for the first time , Sanders has been edited into the cast of the hit â€œshow about nothing.â€ �
The supercut pastes Sandersâ€ ™ head onto the body of George Costanza , the neurotic best friend of the eponymous Jerry Seinfeld character , whose jeremiads about the state of inequality are met with eyerolls and skepticism by the rest of the gang .
For planning purposes : Donald Trump has readily signaled his willingness to inject Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s sexual pecadillos into the 2016 presidential campaign , telling NBC in December that the former president might be likened to a sexual predator .
â€œThere certainly was a lot of abuse of women , you look at whether itâ€ ™ s Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones , or any of them , and that certainly will be fair game , â€ �
Trump said at the time .
But comments unearthed by the Daily Beast show that at the height of the national controversy over the then - presidentâ€ ™ s affair with a White House intern , Trump was singing a different tune : the ballad of a â€œvictimâ€ � injured by a cast of â€œunattractiveâ€ � women .
â€œThe whole thing , itâ€ ™ s just so unattractive ,
â€ �
Trump told Fox News host Neil Cavuto at the time .
â€œLinda Tripp maybe one of the most unattractive human beings Iâ€ ™ ve ever seen - not women , human beings .
Sheâ€ ™ s just an unattractive person .
This [ Lucianne ]
Goldberg person , her agent or whatever she is , is just a terrible woman .
You look at Paula Jones , I mean the whole cast of characters.â€ � â€œItâ€ ™ s like itâ€ ™ s from Hell , â€ � he continued .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a terrible group of people.â€ �
Trump then went on , telling Cavuto that while he didnâ€ ™ t â€œnecessarily agree with [ Clintonâ€ ™ s ] victims ,
â€ � that Clinton was â€œreally a victim himself .
But he put himself in that position.â€ �
The White House has faced tough questioning over comedian Larry Wilmoreâ€
™ s
use of a taboo racial slur at its annual correspondents dinner .
Press secretary Josh Earnest was challenged repeatedly by April Ryan , an African American journalist and author of The Presidency in Black and White , who suggested that many people in the room were â€œappalledâ€ � by the N - word being uttered to the presidentâ€ ™ s face .
Earnest said that Barack Obama appreciated â€œthe spiritâ€ � of Wilmoreâ€ ™ s remark .
Wilmore , who is African American , ended his after - dinner speech on Saturday by recognising the historical significance of Americaâ€ ™ s first black president , pounding his chest and telling Obama : â€œWords alone do me no justice .
So , Mr President , if Iâ€ ™ m going to keep it 100 : yo , Barry , you did it ,
my nigga.â€ �
The comment immediately divided people both in the room and beyond .
Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post blogged : â€œNever before has the n - word been used to address the president .
At least , not in public and most definitely not to his face .
Thatâ€ ™ s why Wilmoreâ€
™ s use of it was as shocking as it was disrespectful.â€ �
At todayâ€ ™ s daily press briefing at the White House , the issue was raised by Ryan , Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks .
She described it as â€œa word that is one of the worst words , many people say , you could say to anyoneâ€ � .
Earnest did not address this directly but noted that following Obamaâ€ ™ s act at the annual dinner is â€œone of the most difficult tasks in comedyâ€ � , since the president has shown himself â€œadeptâ€ � at delivering one - liners and so expects comedians to go â€œright up to the lineâ€ � .
But Ryan pressed further : â€œMany African Americans in that room
â€ “ who included civil rights leaders , black comedians
â€ “ were very appalled ...
Black Republicans were upset , black Democrats were upset .
People felt that not just throwing it at him , he threw it at them , and also , it diminished the office of the presidency and it diminished him .
Did he cross the line?â€ �
Earnest responded : â€œApril , what I would say is itâ€
™ s not the first time that people on the Monday after the White House correspondents dinner have observed that the comedian on Saturday night crossed the line.â€ �
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s hail Mary pass in picking a former California senate candidate as his potential running mate isnâ€ ™ t making the splash he was likely hoping for in the Golden State .
A new poll conducted by SurveyUSA shows that in California , billionaire Republican frontrunner is currently leading the Republican field with the support of 54 % of registered Republican voters , while Cruz trails with 20 % .
Ohio governor John Kasich is currently at the bottom of the three - man dogpile with the support of a mere 16 % of California Republicans .
As for the Democrats , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton currently leads among registered Democrats with 57 % , with Vermont senator Bernie Sanders nearly 20 points behind at 38 % .
At an event in Indiana , billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is making a bit of a hash over Carly Fiorina falling off a stage in the Hoosier State on Sunday .
â€œCarlyâ€ ™ s perfectly nice
- she fell off the stage the other day and Cruz didnâ€ ™ t do anything .
Even I would have helped her!â€ �
Trump said .
â€œThat was a weird deal.â€ �
Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton spoke to coal miners in Kentucky earlier today , and Kentucky senator Rand Paul is not happy about it :
Vermont senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders is pushing the results of a recent poll out of Indiana that shows him within the margin of error of upsetting frontrunner Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s lead in the race for tomorrowâ€ ™ s primary .
â€œWe intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining , starting with tomorrow nightâ€ ™ s primary in Indiana where recent polling shows us well with the margin of error , â€ � a email from the campaign tells supporters , citing an NBC poll that shows Sanders trailing Clinton by four percentage points in the Hoosier State .
Calling the race to win a majority of pledged delegates ahead of the convention â€œadmittedly a tough hill to climb , â€ � Sandersâ€ ™ campaign tells supporters that â€œwinning Indiana tomorrow night would not only cut into Secretary Clintonâ€
™ s lead , but it would send a powerful message to the political establishment and corporate media who just want this race to end
so they can get on with the ratings and fundraising bonanza that would be a Clinton v. Trump general election .
After asking for donations to help this upset occur , Sandersâ€ ™ campaign makes an interesting argument about its ability to keep Clinton from clinching a pledged - delegate majority ( although , perhaps , not a highly accurate one ) :
Letâ€ ™ s be clear .
It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to win all of the pledged delegates she needs to capture the nomination without the help of superdelegates at the convention .
That means every vote we receive , every delegate we win between now and July strengthens our hand as we get to a contested convention .
Weâ€ ™ ll see if this Rudy - like gumption pays off .
CBS News has captured footage of the standoff between Ted Cruz and a Trump supporter in Indiana .
Cruz wades right in and tries to talk him out of his position , to jeers of â€œLyinâ€ ™
Ted!â€ � .
Update : hereâ€ ™ s the footage : Democracy in action .
Watch it here .
More to come .
Yahoo Newsâ€ ™ Hunter Walker has asked Heidi Cruz to comment on comedian Larry Wilmoreâ€ ™ s string of jokes at the White House correspondentsâ€ ™ dinner at her husbandâ€ ™ s expense .
Wilmore referred repeatedly to the good - times Internet habit of pretending that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer , the mysterious and uncaptured serial murderer in California from the 1960s and 1970s .
â€œWell , Iâ€ ™ ve been married to him for 15 years and I know pretty well who he is , so it doesnâ€ ™ t bother me at all .
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of garbage out there , â€ � Heidi Cruz said .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s using a bleakly tinted filter to tweet a picture of himself and Indiana governor Mike Pence Monday with CNN anchor Dana Bash stoked the rumors anew : Here a serious play at the game of lowering expectations , from the husband of a certain top Hillary Clinton aide : There hasnâ€ ™ t been a lot of polling in the Indiana race .
Averages appear to show Clinton up in the race by about 7 points .
But she was supposedly ahead in Michigan , too .
An attempt by the New Hampshire Republican party to limit Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s influence in a potential contested convention was halted Monday , when the state chair canceled a controversial online vote for positions on crucial committees just minutes after the voting deadline , writes Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs :
In an email obtained by the Guardian , party chair Jennifer Horn said that although all 23 of the stateâ€ ™ s delegates to the Republican National Convention participated in the vote , she was canceling it â€œin the interest of full transparencyâ€ � .
Instead , she summoned a delegates - only meeting in Concord on Friday where those unable to attend could participate via conference call .
Initially , in an email sent out Saturday night , the state partyâ€ ™ s executive director proposed a slate for the eight slots on convention committees reserved for New Hampshire delegates at the Republican gathering in Cleveland in July .
The proposed slate included two supporters apiece of John Kasich , Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and one supporter of Marco Rubio .
The eighth slot was left vacant .
Trump won overwhelmingly in the Granite Stateâ€ ™ s February primary , with 35 % of the vote .
His nearest competitor , John Kasich , only received 15 % in what was then the first primary in the country .
Under New Hampshireâ€ ™ s relatively proportional rules , by which any candidate who gets more than 10 % of the vote receives delegates , Trump was awarded 11 of the stateâ€ ™ s 23 delegates .
Since then , the well - organized Cruz campaign has picked up stray delegates in other states that Trump won , such as Louisiana , and swept local contests inWyoming and Colorado .

Ted Cruz is fighting for every last vote in Indiana .
Nominal Ted Cruz running mate Carly Fiorina slipped off a stage at a Cruz rally Monday , according to a Hollywood Reporter dispatch .
Thereâ€ ™ s no report as yet of any injury , details to come .
Update : nothing apparently hurt .
Video shows that Fiorina was quickly back on her feet : Hillary Clinton raised more money than Bernie Sanders last month for the first time in 2016 , according to end - of - month totals released by the campaigns .
Clinton reported a $ 26 m haul for April , while Sanders reportedly took in $ 25.8 m
â€ “ significantly down from his high - water - marks in February and March , when he took in $ 43.5 m and $ 44 m , respectively .
Sixty - five percent of Sandersâ€ ™ fundraising in the cycle this far has come from small individual contributions , according to the campaign finance web site Open Secrets , compared with 19 % for Clinton .
Clinton has reported receipt of $ 133 m in large individual contributions , versus $ 64 m for Sanders .
Half of registered voters in North Carolina disapprove of a law barring transgender people access to their preferred bathrooms and nearly as many want the law repealed , according to a new survey from bipartisan polling firm Red America , Blue America .
Forty - eight percent of poll respondents said they believed the law , HB2 , should be repealed , while 34 % wanted the law to remain in place and 18 % were not sure .
The result appeared to hinge on political independents , who disapproved of the law 52 - 33 .
Republicans in the poll largely supported the law , which was signed by Republican governor Pat McCrory in March , while Democrats opposed it .
Some North Carolinians believe the law has cost the state economically .
In protest of the law , PayPal canceled plans for a facility in Charlotte , North Carolina , that would have created 500 local jobs , the Charlotte Observer reported , while â€œat least 20 conventions and events have dropped plans to come.â€ � â€œNorth Carolina did something that was very strong .
And theyâ€ ™ re paying a big price , thereâ€ ™ s a lot of problems , â€ �
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said last month .
McRory , who is in a re - election fight this year , has blamed the Charlotte mayor for the law , which the legislature signed in a special rush session after the city of Charlotte passed a local ordinance saying that people could use bathrooms in line with their gender identities , irrespective of what was on their birth certificates .
â€œItâ€ ™ s absolutely not personal on my end , â€ �
McRory told the Observer on Friday .
â€œWe have to correct the record of both your newspaper and national newspapers
â€ ¦
This whole bathroom idea was the political leftâ€
™ s idea , not the political right.â€
�
That was a slightly different explanation from the one he gave at the time : Pollster Brad Anderson of Red America , Blue America said the law may also be influencing the stateâ€ ™ s attorney general race , in which the Republican candidate called on supporters at a rally to â€œkeep our state straight.â€ � â€œIt is a safe bet to say the new HB2 legislation has done the Republican party no favors in North Carolina , â€ � Anderson said .
â€œIndependent voters oppose the law just as strongly as Republicans support it , which could be a problem for Republicans in November.â€ � First billionaire bankroller Charles Koch suggested that it was possible that he and his brother , David , would support Hillary Clinton over the Republican nominee .
Now Republican representative David Jolly of Florida , whoâ€ ™ s running for the US senate , says he does not know whom he would support in a Clinton - Trump race .
â€œSo , Iâ€ ™ m going tell you something you rarely hear in elected official
say : I donâ€ ™ t know , â€ �
Jolly told AM970
The Answer , in an interview flagged by BuzzFeedâ€ ™ s Andrew Kaczynski .
â€œI truly donâ€
™ t know.â€
�
Jolly said he called on Trump to drop out of the race after Trump called for a ban on Muslims .
â€œI also have strong disagreements with secretary Clinton , â€ � Jolly says .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a Republican , and I hope we can find a conservative leader.â€ � Campaign bloopers .
Although anything looks like a blooper when you loop it over a tuba bassline like that and finish with an air horn .
This is a pretty bracing anti - Trump ad from the senate race in Arkansas .
It accuses Trump of harassment , with selections from the catalogue of odious things Trump has said about women , including a few less well circulated examples : Update : influential anti - Trump conservative voices think it hits the mark :
Ted Cruz needs 672 more delegates to clear 1,237 , according to the AP tally .
Unfortunately , there are only 10 Republican contests left â€ “ and only 502 pledged delegates remain to be awarded .
So any path Cruz has to the Republican nomination , barring some truly wild twist , involves Donald Trump failing to capture a 1,237 delegate majority , unleashing a chaos from which Cruz could emerge as the nominee .
Cruz said on Monday that he â€œabsolutelyâ€ � has a path to the nomination if he loses in Indiana , where the victor is expected to gather 40-some delegates .
If Trump collects such a prize , he would need to grab about 45 % of the remaining pledged delegates to cross the line , very doable for him based on past performance .
( And Trump could get to 1,237 without winning Indiana . )
The path Cruz sees to the nomination after an Indiana loss , in short , remains well - hidden to everyone else , and would seem to involve a sudden and drastic shift in momentum in the race of the kind thatâ€ ™ s difficult to imagine .
FiveThirtyEightâ€ ™ s
Harry Enten notes the historic unpopularity , going back to 1988 , of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , at this stage in the nominating race .
The figures below reflect the opinions of the public at large .
Both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are viewed favorably by a majority of Republican voters , according to polling .
Clintonâ€ ™ s favorability among Democrats hit a new low last month , but remained as high as + 36 or 66 - 30 , according to Gallup .
Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ net favorability among Democrats was measured highest of all , at + 52 .
So the historic un - favorability of the frontrunners this cycle may in part be attributable to growing political polarization , in which a smaller share of partisans on one side are open to seeing the other sideâ€ ™ s nominee as acceptable .
Racing to close the deal in Indiana , Ted Cruz has rolled out a video ad featuring his endorsement by governor Mike Spence , whom Donald Trump was actively courting late last month .
But Spence , who signed a law placing new restrictions on abortions in March , rebuffed Trumpâ€ ™ s overtures to back Cruz , whom he praises as a â€œprincipled conservativeâ€ � .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a Reagan conservative
, â€ �
Spence says in the new ad .
â€œI
see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative whoâ€ ™
s dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda.â€ �
Maricella Olvera encounters Donald Trump on occasion , but sheâ€ ™ s careful not to say a word .
The 47-year - old cleans the penthouse at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas , where Trump , his family , and celebrity guests often come to stay .
She cleans around them in silence .
Trump is always uninterested , report the Guardianâ€ ™ s Oliver Laughland and Mae West : â€œThe policy is : you donâ€ ™ t talk to the boss , â€ �
she said at her small one - bedroom home , on the joyously named Sing Song Way in the cityâ€ ™ s northern suburbs .
While Olvera may be silent at work , she and a collective of cleaners , bar workers , and kitchen staff at the Trump hotel have been a thorn in the billionaireâ€ ™ s side for the past year , using what voice they have to remind the public of the hypocrisy that surrounds his audacious run for the presidency and his record as an employer .
Although Trump has touted himself as â€œthe greatest jobs president that God has ever createdâ€ � , these workers point to the fact they are paid on average $ 3 less than the thousands of unionised hotel workers in Las Vegas who work identical jobs and enjoy a host of other benefits , including pensions and free health insurance , not available to Trump employees .
Earlier this month , following a protracted dispute with Trump and his co - owner , casino billionaire Phil Ruffin , the National Labor Relations Board officially certified a union for over 500 staff at the hotel .
Workers argue they have been subjected to surveillance , intimidation , and unlawful dismissal as they have sought to organize .

Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
A Marist poll released at the weekend had Donald Trump ahead of Ted Cruz by 15 points , 49 - 34 , in the Republican race in Indiana , which holds primaries tomorrow and which could significantly simplify Trumpâ€ ™ s path to winning the Republican presidential nomination outright .
( Trumpâ€ ™ s lead in the Marist poll was about double his lead in polling averages . )
If talk of a contested convention is diminishing on the Republican side , however , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has predicted such a twist in the Democratic race .
Sanders said on Sunday that he would continue battling against Hillary Clinton , revealing plans for a new series of mega - rallies in California .
â€œShe will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia , â€ � Sanders said .
â€œIn other words the convention will be a contested contest.â€ �
The Republican fight for Indiana , meanwhile , saw Texas senator Ted Cruz make a last - ditch series of attacks on Donald Trump on Sunday .
â€œNo one is going to clinch it on the first ballot .
Iâ€ ™ m not and Donald Trump is not either , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s why Donald Trump is so desperate to say itâ€ ™ s over now ...
Itâ€ ™ s going to be a contested convention.â€ �

One recent public poll had the real estate mogul up 15 points over rival Ted Cruz , who was heckled by a 12-year - old and quizzed about his birthplace while his wife faced questions over whether he was a serial killer yesterday .
Oh , and he seemed to ignore his running mate
Carly Fiorina falling off the stage .
These indignities and others came on the last day of campaigning in a state he desperately needs to win in order to continue his strategy of denying Donald Trump the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the GOP nomination .

On the Democratic side Hillary Clinton is a few points ahead of Bernie Sanders in the polls .
Results are expected some time after 6 pm ET and weâ€ ™ ll have live coverage throughout the evening .

2016-05-03,"Donald Trump only needs to win Indiana on Tuesday by a single vote to be the likely Republican nominee .
One recent public poll had the real estate mogul up 15 points over rival Ted Cruz , giving Trump plenty of margin for error .
If Trump wins the 30 delegates that Indiana awards the winner of the stateâ€ ™ s popular vote ( the winners in each of the stateâ€ ™ s nine congressional districts receive three delegates apiece ) , only a huge upset by Cruz in California can stop him obtaining the 1,237 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot .
By Monday , Trump had 996 pledged delegates .
Considering the frontrunner is expected to win New Jerseyâ€ ™ s June primary , which awards all 51 delegates to the winner , a win in Indiana would mean that Trump could seal the nomination even with a mediocre performance in California .
The result is that campaigns have gone all - in in the Hoosier State .
Desperate anti - Trump forces pressured the stateâ€ ™ s governor , Mike Pence , into an endorsement of Cruz , while Trump has trotted out the legendary Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight as a supporter , along with a constellation of the stateâ€ ™ s other sporting celebrities .
The stakes for Cruz have grown so desperate that , in an unprecedented move , he announced former rival Carly Fiorina as his running mate in Indianapolis last week in an attempt to gain momentum .
The bitterness and rancor between Cruz and Trump has reached epic proportions .
Cruz , who once described Trump as a â€œfriendâ€ � , is now slamming him as someone who wants to let grown men â€œin the little girlsâ€ ™ restroomâ€ � as well as being a liar and a New York liberal .
In contrast , Trump has long labeled Cruz â€œlyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � , a shout that is given constantly at the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s rallies .
Trump has even attacked the appearance of the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s wife .
Many supporters of each candidate wouldnâ€ ™ t consider ultimately voting for the other .
Michael Strawn , a 52-year - old mortgage banker from Carmel , Indiana , who supports Cruz , told the Guardian : â€œDonald Trump scares me .
He is unpredictable and self - centered.â€ �
A lifelong Republican , Strawn said he would have a hard time voting for Trump if he was the nominee .
â€œI know what the worst case is with Hillary .
I donâ€ ™ t like it
but I can manage .
With Trump I just donâ€ ™
t know.â€
�
In contrast , Danny Buechler of Greenfield not only couldnâ€ ™ t imagine voting for Cruz , but he couldnâ€ ™ t imagine voting for anyone besides Trump .
The long - bearded biker , who wore a black cowboy hat with â€œTrumpâ€ � written in silver , said he had last voted for Richard Nixon in 1968 .
To him , the Republican frontrunner represented â€œtruth and changeâ€ � , and Buechler took reassurance in the fact that the mogul â€œainâ€ ™ t a politician yetâ€ � .
Many Trump voters shared this suspicion of politics as usual .
One calling himself Tom told the Guardian at the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s rally in Indianapolis on Wednesday : â€œWe need someone thatâ€ ™ s not a puppet , thatâ€ ™ s not bought.â€ �
To him almost every politician going back over a century was bought .
This included Reagan , â€œwho was a decent president , but he was still on leashâ€ � .
Trump was different , Tom reckoned .
The Trump rally was certainly different .
In a performing arts center built to look like an old - fashioned theater , the frontrunner seemed in high spirits as he used uncharacteristically populist language for a Republican .
â€œFrankly , I donâ€ ™ t like the rich people so much.â€
�
As much as he liked attacking â€œlyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � , Trump seemed to be pivoting to a general election , echoing Bernie Sanders in saying former secretary of state Clinton had â€œbad judgmentâ€ � .
But mostly Trump seemed to be taking a victory lap .
He insisted : â€œIf we win Indiana , itâ€ ™ s over â€ “ theyâ€ ™ re finished , they are done .
â€œAnd if we donâ€ ™ t Iâ€ ™ ll win it next week or the week after or the week after .
They have no path
and I have a very easy path.â€
�
He even bragged about how good he would be in the Oval Office after Bobby Knight said â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s going to be a great presidentâ€ � .
Trump responded : â€œI canâ€ ™ t say that about myself but OK , Iâ€ ™ ll say it.â€ �
In contrast , Cruz held an election eve rally in a half - full barn on the Indiana state fairgrounds .
Whereas Trump rallies can feel like rock concerts â€ “ with college - age white men in Make America Great Again hats and vendors outside selling vulgar T - shirts about Hillary Clinton â€
“ Cruzâ€ ™
s
events can often feel like church meetings .
The room was packed with families .
It seemed almost as many people were holding children on their shoulders as Cruz signs over their heads .
The Texas senator dismissed Trump as a bully who depended on the type of language one might expect from an after - school special .
â€œBullies have a empty hole inside they fill by trying to find someone weaker than they are , picking on them , abusing them.â€
�
Mostly he adhered to his repeated arguments that he was the real conservative and Trump was a fake , repeating a stump standard â€œthat Donald Trump has been supporting liberal Democrats for over 40 yearsâ€ � .
Cruz even came close to accusing Trump of being pro - rape , noting that the frontrunner had praised former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson , whom Cruz noted â€œwas a convicted rapist , who spent three years in prison here in Indiana for raping a 17-year - old girlâ€ � .
The most powerful moment in Cruzâ€ ™ s speech came when he discussed his confrontation with pro - Trump protesters at a campaign event in Marion earlier in the day .
He related his experience where he went over to try to persuade them of the error of their ways .
As Cruz described it , â€œon one side we had a civil , respectful conversationâ€ � , on the other the Trump supporters repeatedly called him a liar .
Cruz expressed his befuddlement as he contrasted his record on the second amendment , immigration and gun control .
The response was to be repeatedly called a liar .
Cruz defiantly insisted that â€œtruth mattersâ€ � to a cheering crowd at his own rally , and seemed to express more sadness than anger about how his opponentâ€ ™ s supporters responded to him .
But while the Texas senator may still be breathing defiance , others within the party are starting to make peace with the idea of Trump as the nominee .
Establishment doyens such as Jon Huntsman , who mounted a failed presidential bid in 2012 trying to push the GOP to more moderate positions , and Ron Kaufman , a longtime confidant of Mitt Romney and George HW Bush , are already calling for the party to rally around Trump .
But Brad Armstrong , a two - term county commissioner from Hancock County , Indiana , may best typify the movement towards Trump .
Armstrong , who was on the ballot for a third term on Tuesday , was an avid Fred Thompson supporter in 2008 and was supporting representative Todd Young , the establishment choice , in the stateâ€ ™ s Senate primary on Tuesday .
He said he was supporting Young over Freedom Caucus member Marlin Stutzman because â€œwe donâ€ ™ t want another Richard Mourdock scenarioâ€ � .
This was a reference to the 2012 Republican Senate primary where a Tea Party candidate upset six - term senator Richard Lugar and then lost the general election to the Democrat .
Armstrong was voting for Trump .
It may not be happening nationally yet
but , at least in one corner of Indiana , it seems the party has decided ."
2016-05-03,"In December , Ted Cruz called Donald Trump â€œterrificâ€ � .
On Tuesday , just hours before polls close in Indiana , Cruz described the Republican frontrunner as â€œa serial philandererâ€ � , an â€œamoral pathological liarâ€ � , and a â€œbraggadocious , arrogant buffoonâ€ � .
â€œIf Indiana does not act , this country could well plunge into the abyss , â€ �
he said .
The senatorâ€ ™ s tirade against his rival came only a few hours after Trump suggested that Cruzâ€ ™ s father was somehow involved in the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy , using a tabloid story as his source .
â€œNobody even brings it up , they donâ€ ™ t even talk about it ,
â€ �
Trump said .
A spokesperson for Cruz immediately called Trump â€œdetached from realityâ€ � , but the senator felt compelled to give a press conference full of the scathing personal attacks that he had previously said he would resist .
â€œI am going to do something I havenâ€ ™ t done this entire campaign , I am going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump , â€ � he began .
Cruz then poured sarcasm , disbelief and derision on the man who stands poised to secure the Republican nomination : â€œYes , my dad killed JFK , he is secretly Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard .
â€œThis is just kooky , â€ � he continued , calling Trump â€œa narcissist at a level I donâ€
™ t think this country has ever seen .
Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says , â€˜Dude , whatâ€ ™ s your problem?â€
™ â€ �
The senator was infuriated by Trumpâ€ ™ s baseless claim about his father that he scorned the thrice - married businessman as a â€œserial philanderer â€ “ and he boasts about it!â€ �
The businessman â€œdescribes his battles with venereal disease as his own personal Vietnamâ€ � , Cruz said , alluding to a radio interview in which Trump likened his sex life to the war .
â€œMorality does not exist for him.â€ �
Reality itself is at odds with Trump , Cruz continued : â€œIf you hooked him up to a lie detector test , he could say one thing in the morning , one thing at noon and one thing in the evening
â€ “ all contradictory â€
“ and heâ€ ™
d pass the lie detector test .
Whatever lie heâ€ ™ s telling , in that minute he believes it.â€
�
Though Cruz did not say he would not support Trump in the general election , should the former reality TV star win the Republican nomination , he drew very close to the line .
Adding a layer of surreality to the already strange campaign , he compared Trump to Biff Tannen , the fictional villain of Back to the Future Part II , the 1989 film whose writer was partially inspired by Trump .
â€œWe are looking potentially at the Biff Tannen presidency , â€ � Cruz said .
He even turned to slam Fox News and the two powerful conservatives who run the cable network , saying : â€œRupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes have turned Fox News into the Donald Trump Network 24/7.â€ �
An attack against the rightwing news network would have been considered heresy among Republicans not long ago , but Cruz has grown increasingly critical of the company over perceived bias by some of its anchors , such as Sean Hannity .
Cruz pleaded with the voters of Indiana , a state he needs to do well in to preserve a chance of a contested convention , to keep his hopes alive .
â€œThis is not who America is , and I would say to the Hoosier State : the entire country is depending on you.â€ �
The Texas senator was so infuriated by Trumpâ€ ™ s claims over the JFK assassination that he then proceeded to call Trump â€œa pathological liarâ€ � and added : â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t know the difference between truth and lies , he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth.â€ �
Both Republican campaigns had their own accounts of the spat .
A spokesperson for Cruz called the tabloid story , which based its allegations on a grainy picture of dubious credibility , â€œa garbage story and clearly Donald wants to talk about garbageâ€ � .
Trumpâ€ ™ s put out a statement on â€œthe most recent outburst from Ted Cruzâ€ � .
â€œOver the last week , I have watched Lyinâ€ ™
Ted become more and more unhinged as he is unable to react under the pressure and stress of losing , â€ � the businessman said in the statement .
â€œIt is no surprise he has resorted to his usual tactics of over - the - top rhetoric that nobody believes.â€ �"
2016-05-03,"Weâ€ ™ re going to wrap up our live coverage of the Indiana primaries shortly .
Hereâ€ ™ s what happened :
Donald Trump emerged as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee with a resounding victory in Indiana , as Ted Cruz suspended his presidential campaign .
Bernie Sanders scored an upset victory over Hillary Clinton , though the two split the delegate pile .
Sanders vowed the nominating race was not over .
Cruz did not mention Trump as he mothballed his campaign but called for the Republican party to look to the far horizon ( his 2020 bid ? ) .
â€œIâ€ ™ m sorry to say , it appears that path [ to victory ] has been foreclosed , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œWe gave it everything weâ€ ™ ve got.â€ �
Trump praised Cruz as â€œone hell of a competitorâ€ � and â€œa tough , smart guy.â€ �
It was a change in tone from the morning , when he had suggested Cruzâ€ ™ s father had had a hand in the JFK assassination and Cruz had brought up Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œbattles with venereal diseaseâ€ � .
Republican party chair Reince Priebus called Trump the â€œpresumptive nominee.â€ �
Trump said : â€œWe want to bring unity to the Republican party.â€ �
Many Republicans resisted that call , vowing on social media to support Clinton or , in any case , not to support Trump .
Clinton invited supporters to â€œchip in now if you agree we canâ€ ™ t let [ Trump ] become presidentâ€ � .
John Kasichâ€ ™ s campaign said he was staying in :
â€œTonightâ€ ™ s results are not going to alter Governor Kasichâ€ ™ s campaign plans.â€
�
Cruz did not depart the national stage gracefully , exactly , elbowing his wife in the face on the way : Here are tomorrowâ€ ™ s local tabloid covers : The Indiana breakdown of pledged delegates could see Sanders gain seven .
The state also will contribute nine unpledged delegates to the convention who could ... reverse that : Turn out the lights ...
John Podesta , chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign , has released a statement saying that Trump is not prepared to be president and is â€œtoo big of a riskâ€ � .
Hereâ€ ™ s the statement : Fundamentally , our next president will need to do two things : keep our nation safe in a dangerous world and help working families get ahead here at home .
Donald Trump is not prepared to do either .
Throughout this campaign , Donald Trump has demonstrated that heâ€ ™ s too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our nation and the free world .
With so much at stake , Donald Trump is simply too big of a risk .
Hillary Clinton has proven that she has the strength to keep us safe in an uncertain world and a lifelong record of fighting to break down the barriers -- economic and social -- that hold working families back .
While Donald Trump seeks to bully and divide Americans , Hillary Clinton will unite us to create an economy that works for everyone .
Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ speech tonight in Louisville was interrupted for a moment when it looked like he might have won Indiana .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s hold off , â€ � he said .
â€œNot for sure.â€ �
Heâ€ ™ s holding a 6-point margin with 86.7 % reporting â€ “ visit our interactive results map here .
Sanders has weighed in on his Indiana win .
I understand that secretary Clinton thinks that this campaign is over .
Iâ€ ™ ve got some bad news for her .
Sanders has now won primaries in 18 states .
Is this OK ?
All jokes are off ?
Former presidential candidate and former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley has some choice words for Trump :
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ed Pilkington reports from Trump Tower on Trumpâ€ ™ s makenice speech : Flanked by his wife Melania and children , with his controversial campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and convention manager Paul Manafort close by , Trump made an inclusive speech in which he tried to heal some of the open wounds of the past year and begin the long and very difficult process of unifying the party .
He even said some kind words about his nemesis Cruz at the end of a day in which further ugly words had passed between the candidates .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if he likes me or doesnâ€ ™ t like me , â€ �
he said of the senator for Texas .
â€œBut he is one hell of a competitor .
He has an amazing future.â€ �
Trump also made soothing noises towards the Republican National Committee and its chairman Reince Preibus .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not an easy job dealing with 17 egos , â€ � referring to the initial crowded pack of Republican presidential hopefuls , before adding : â€œI guess heâ€
™ s now down to one ego.â€
�
Weâ€ ™ ll have a link to the full piece shortly .
Clinton is hiring up for the general election : Cruz volunteers in Indianapolis pull off a self - evidently patriotic rendition of the national anthem with moments of near - harmony : The usually brash New York billionaire struck an unusually subdued tone in his speech .
While the speech was somewhat â€œlow energyâ€ � , it wasnâ€ ™ t lacking in attacks .
These are now firmly centered on Hillary Clinton .
In a preview of Trumpâ€ ™ s general election strategy , and recognizing that any successful path for him relies on rust belt states like Michigan and Pennsylvania , Trump focused heavily on trade and jobs .
Echoing his foreign policy speech that he delivered last week , Trump said his campaign was going to be about â€œAmerica Firstâ€ � - a slogan that may be his general election equivalent of â€œMake America Great Again.â€ �
When it came to his former rival Ted Cruz , Trump was conciliatory , saying , â€œhe is one hell of a competitor , he is a tough , smart guy.â€
�
As Trump was making his pitch for party unity , many high profile conservative activists on Twitter were continuing to say that they will never support a Trump candidacy .
While it remains to be seen whether Trump can first unite the base and then reach out to win over independents and disaffected Democrats , one thing is certain : this election is going to be unlike anything we have ever seen before .
On Twitter , at least .
Hereâ€ ™ s a sampler :
Trump :
â€œSarah Palin has been from Day One , incredible .
â€œJerry Falwell Jr , from Liberty University ...
heâ€
™ s a special guy .
â€œTonight
I see I won with the evangelical voters.â€
�
More riffing :
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to be saying Merry Christmas again.â€ �
And this is true of the Indiana returns : â€œI won with women .
I love winning with women.â€ �
Then further good words for Cruz , who hours ago called Trump a â€œpathological liarâ€ � and â€œserial philandererâ€ � after Trump tied Cruzâ€ ™ s father to the JFK assassination :
I want to congratulate Ted Cruz .
He is a tough , smart competitor .
Thatâ€ ™ s it .
Trump is done .
Trump describes a vision of a country where people â€œcherish each otherâ€
�
: Weâ€ ™ re going to love each other , weâ€ ™ re going to cherish each other , weâ€ ™ re going to take care of each other , and weâ€ ™ re going to have great economic development .
Trump says he just spoke with Reince Priebus , the Republican party boss , whoâ€ ™ s doing a great job .
â€œI guess
heâ€
™ s down to oneâ€ � from 17 candidates , Trump says .
Kasich must be stewing at that line .
â€œWe want to bring unity to the Republican party .
We have to bring unity . ...
Many many people are calling ,
like you wouldnâ€ ™ t believe.â€
�
Hillary Clinton has begun fundraising off the Trump nomination : â€œWeâ€ ™ re gon na win .
Weâ€ ™ re gon na win in November .
And weâ€ ™ re gon na win big.â€ �
He promises â€œunbelievably good relationships with other countriesâ€ � â€ “ Mexico ?
China ?
â€
“
â€œbut theyâ€ ™ re going to have to treat us fairly.â€ �
Bernie Sanders has defeated Hillary Clinton in Indiana , the AP projects .
Awkward .
But thatâ€ ™ s not new to this race .
It appears theyâ€ ™ ll split the 83 pledged delegates closely .
â€œThe American people understand that coming together always trumps dividing us up , â€ � Sanders said earlier tonight .
Trump : Iâ€ ™ ve competed all my life ...
All my life Iâ€ ™ ve been in competitions , different competitions ...
and I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors right here in the Republican party ...
Ted Cruz , I donâ€
™ t know if he likes me or doesnâ€ ™ t like me .
But he is one hell of a competitor .
He is a tough , smart , guy .
And he has got an amazing future .
I want to congratulate Ted .
I know how tough it is .
Itâ€ ™ s tough ...
I understand how Ted feels and Heidi , and their whole beautiful family .
I want to just say though , one tough competitor .
Trump : â€œHillary Clinton , she will not be a great president , she will not be a good president .
She will be a poor president .
She does not understand trade .
Her husband signed , perhaps , in the history of the world , the single worst trade deal ever done .
Itâ€ ™ s called Nafta.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve witnessed what itâ€ ™ s done really firsthand , and it has been indeed carnage.â€ � â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to bring back our jobs and weâ€ ™ re going to keep our jobs .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to let companies leave.â€ �
Trump is mellow in victory , speaking in even tones , conversationally , just riffing .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to Nebraska where I just hear weâ€ ™ re doing really wonderfully ... and West Virginia .
Weâ€ ™ re going to get those miners back to work.â€
�
Now he hits Clinton , who had talked about closing mines but then apologized in West Virginia .
for saying that .
â€œLet me tell you , â€ �
Trump says , â€œthe miners in Pennsylvania and West Virginia are going to start to work again .
Youâ€ ™ re going to be proud again to be miners.â€ �
Trump says when he got back to New York tonight and started watching the networks , he realized he could win all 57 delegates in Indiana .
â€œI must say , in staying in various places in Indiana , I turned on the television and all I saw was negative ads.â€
�
â€œIt was the same as Florida .
60,000 negative ads , most of which are absolutely false and disgusting . ...
And the people are so smart , they donâ€
™ t buy it , they get
it.â€
�
Trump thanks his wife , kids , late parents and brother .
He sounds pleased .
â€œItâ€
™ s been some unbelievable day , evening and year ...
Iâ€ ™ ve never been through anything like this ...
itâ€ ™ s a beautiful thing to behold and weâ€ ™ re going to make America great again.â€
�
Hereâ€ ™ s that video stream again :
The chairman of the Republican national committee says that Trump will nab the nomination and calls for party unity ( if he botches the spelling a bit ) :
For Ted Cruz , the End is Now .
The senator said he expected to win in Indiana .
Just the other day , he told voters : â€œit gives me great comfort that this primary is going to be decided by the Midwestern common sense of the Hoosier State.â€ �
Cruz was right , Indiana has decided the Republican primary .
Unfortunately for Cruz the state has decided Donald Trump is the nominee .
After being beaten handily by Trump - all but guaranteeing Trump will now secure the 1,237 delegates necessary to secure the nomination on the first ballot - Ted Cruz said he is ending his campaign for president .
In his concession speech , Cruz , perhaps with an eye to 2020 , sounded more like a man on the cusp of accepting his partyâ€ ™ s nomination than one who was announcing the end of his campaign .
After lengthy speech outlining his vision for the country , Cruz declared , â€œwith a heavy heart , but with boundless optimism for the future , we are suspending our campaign for presidentâ€ � .
Cruzâ€ ™ s declaration is an admission that he no longer had a path to victory in his fight against Trump .
Interestingly , missing from Cruzâ€ ™ s extended remarks was any reference to the now presumptive nominee of the Republican Party : Donald Trump .
It is clear that Cruz has ended his fight for the nomination .
But donâ€ ™ t think he has ended his fight with the billionaire businessman .
While we wait for Trump â€
“ whatâ€ ™ s happening on the Democratic side ?
With 60.8 % reporting , Bernie Sanders leads Hillary Clinton 53.1%â€“46.9 % .
Precincts late to report include some in northwestern Lake County , which is favorable to Clinton â€ “ but maybe not favorable enough .
Our comprehensive results map is here : Weâ€ ™ re expecting to hear from the highly likely nominee shortly .
Live video feed will come online here : The Guardianâ€ ™ s Ed Pilkington is at Trump Tower :
Cruz winds to a close : In this fight for the long - term future of America , there is no substitute for victory .
There is no substitute for the America that each of us loves with all of our heartâ€ ¦
Thank you to each of you , and god bless you .
Cruz is done .
Cruz thanks his mom and dad , and then â€œCarly Fiorina , who has been an incredible , phenomenal running mateâ€ �
â€ “ for six days now .
Cruz : What you have done , the movement that you have started is extraordinary .
From the beginning , Iâ€ ™ ve said that I would continue on â€ ¦
Tonight , Iâ€ ™ m sorry to say , it appears that path has been foreclosed .
â€œNo!â€
� his supporters shout .
Cruz :
We gave it everything weâ€ ™ ve got , but the voters chose another path â€ ¦ With a heavy heart , but with boundless optimism for the long - term future of our nation , we are suspending our campaign .
As news of his campaign suspension breaks , Cruz continues to speak â€ “ he has not actually said it yet .
Here it comes : Thanks to each of you .
Incredible patriots who have fought so hard to save our nation .
I am so grateful to you .
To my amazing wife Heidi .
To our precious girls ...
Ted Cruz suspended his campaign on Tuesday after a crushing defeat in Indianaâ€ ™ s primary , reports Ben Jacobs :
The Texas senator , who rose to fame with his quixotic 17-day attempt to shut down the government , was the last remaining competitor to Donald Trump with a clear shot at the nomination .
However , after staking his campaign on a win in Indiana , Cruz suffered an overwhelming loss in the Hoosier state .
Cruz leaves the race having won 565 delegates and 11 states , including the first in the nation Iowa caucuses .
Despite successfully building a strong base among evangelicals and social conservatives , he was unable to expand his following and to pivot to the unpredictable Trump , who repeatedly bashed him as â€œlyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � .
Ted Cruz is suspending his presidential campaign , the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs has confirmed .
It appears those two Trump tweets from about 90 minutes ago really hit the mark .
Happy !
Cruz is speaking in the broadest possible terms about the challenges facing Republicans , future generations , the â€œtyranny of political correctnessâ€ � , founding values
â€ “ all the kinds of things you might say if you were announcing the suspension of your presidential campaign .
Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts :
Cruz is talking about how far heâ€ ™ s come , how heâ€ ™ s lived the American dream , how his father was a â€œteenage immigrant washing dishesâ€ � .
â€œOnly in America , â€ � Cruz says .
Which is not the same as â€œonward to West Virginiaâ€ � .
Cruz says people have been talking about a contested convention , and the last one 40 years ago .
At the time , he says , Ronald Reagan â€œspoke of the next 100
yearsâ€ � , looking to the distant not the near horizon .
Ronald Reagan spoke with a purpose â€ ¦ that must unite and drive our party now .
Americans are deeply frustrated and desperately want to change the path that weâ€ ™ re on .
Cruz is striking a valedictory tone in this speech .
He is â€ “ unusually for an election night â€ “ reading from a teleprompter .
America is hopeful , optimistic , .
We are not boastful or mean - spirited .
America is brave .
We keep our word .
And we believe in peace through strength .
What is Cruz trying to say here ?
Hmm ...
Carly Fiorina warms up the crowd for Cruz .
She says she speaks for the Cruz family and team when she says â€œhow many Hoosiers we have fallen in love with on this campaignâ€ � .

The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ed Pilkington sends a dispatch from Trump Tower , where heâ€ ™ s in position to catch the victorâ€ ™ s speech , expected in about 40 minutes .
â€œThe Trump inner circle is already turning up the heat on Ted Cruz to drop out of the race in the wake of the resounding Indiana result , â€ �
Ed reports : Iâ€ ™ ve just been talking to Eric Trump , the billionaireâ€ ™ s son , as we wait for the candidate to make his victory speech back on home turf in Trump Tower .
The 32-year - old son of Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana let rip to the Guardian about the senator for Texas .
At the end of a long day in which the ugly war of words between the two presidential hopefuls reached new lows , the younger Trump said that Cruz had â€˜zero road aheadâ€ ™ .
â€˜Truth be told , if Ted Cruz stays in the race he will be doing it for his own selfish reasons and not for the good of the party , â€ ™ Eric said .
â€˜We should be turning our attention to Hillary Clinton and beating the Democrats in November , but instead we will have to keep focusing on a guy who has lost the entire east coast and south of the country , who is three - and - a - half million votes behind , 500 delegates behind and has zero chance of getting the nomination.â€ ™
You know that something extraordinary has happened tonight when you hear the Trump team talking about â€˜the good of the Republican partyâ€ ™ .
As a parting shot , I asked Eric whether we could now expect his father to adopt a new tone as he heads into the general election .
He paused , and then he said : â€˜I think my father will now start turning his attention to her .
Itâ€ ™ s time for Hillary.â€ ™ A politicianâ€ ™ s answer .
Are we seeing another American dynasty â€ “ Kennedy , Bush , Clinton â€ ¦
Trump â€ “ in the making ?
Weâ€
™ re expecting to hear from Ted Cruz in Indianapolis any moment now .
Watch him live here :
Sanders adopts a line from Clinton , about love trumping hate .
This sounds an awful lot like a first step to party unity : We are stronger .
And the American people understand that coming together always trumps dividing us up .
Sanders goes on to say that generosity trumps selfishness and â€œat the end of the day , love always Trumps hatredâ€
� .
Weâ€ ™ re already heard from a top architect of the 2008 John McCain campaign , Steve Schmidt , who says itâ€ ™ s
â€œ100%â€ � that Trump will be the nominee .
Now hereâ€ ™ s a top architect of the 2012 Mitt Romney campaign :
Trumpâ€ ™ s next move : West Virginia .
The Mountain State votes , along with Nebraska , in one week .
Thirty - four Republican delegates awarded on a proportional basis will be at stake .
Trump is polling very well there .
Hoosier daddy .
Not bad , Post :
Steve Schmidt was a George W Bush adviser and lead strategist on the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign .
He said very early on , when most people were writing Trump off , that Trump could win the Republican nomination .
Now he says he was right :
Hereâ€ ™ s the view , meanwhile , from the Democratic political professional side : One unavoidable take - away tonight is that voters really , really donâ€ ™ t like Ted Cruz , notes Lucia Graves
Trump has said of Cruz , â€œeverybody hates Tedâ€ � when they get to know him .
Like many of Trumpâ€ ™ s attacks ,
itâ€ ™ s nasty but
thereâ€ ™ s
truth to it .
John Boehner lent further credence to the notion last week when he referred to the senator from Texas as â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � last week .
Now it appears Indiana voters feel the same way as lawmakers : having gotten to know him , they donâ€ ™ t like him too much .
No sooner had the polls closed than it became apparent Trump was going to win again and by a landslide .
This after Cruz had been polling relatively well in the state until recently .
His dip in the polls , tellingly if you ask Trump , coincides with the time when he started campaigning intensively in the state .
And he did try everything , driving home his conservative bonafides , signing a non - aggression pact with John Kasich , and even declaring a vice presidential pick early to attract attention .
He spent enough money to ensure the voters heard him loud and clear â€ “
they just , like so many others before them , didnâ€ ™ t like what they heard one bit .
Sanders continues his speech in Louisville .
Itâ€ ™ s his straight stump speech so far , declaring that â€œnow is the time for Wall Street to help the middle class of this countryâ€
�
: A great nation is not judged by the number of billionaires and nuclear weapons it has .
A great nation is judged by how it treats the most vulnerable and weak among us .
No inflection so far referring to the tight race in Indiana or what it might mean , as whatever happens , Sanders is expected to chug through to the final contest in Washington DC on 14 June .
A live video feed of the Sanders speech is in a block from 15 minutes ago .
For the good of what party ?
With 17.3 % reporting , it was an even 50 - 50 race on the Democratic side .
But now Sanders has pulled ahead by a couple of tenths of a percent .
Follow along here :
* low whistle *
Hereâ€ ™ s another sample from conservatives populating the land of # NeverTrump :
Our Principles Pac , the conservative anti - Trump force , holds out hope for a contested convention , in a statement issued to reporters : â€œWhile tonightâ€ ™ s Indiana primary results increased Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s delegate count , Trump remains short of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination , â€ � said OPP chair Katie Packer .
A substantial number of delegates remain up for grabs in this highly unpredictable year .
In addition , there is more than a month before the California primary â€ “ more time for Trump to continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters , as he did yet again today spreading absurd tabloid lies about Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father and the JFK assassination .
[ ... ] We will continue to educate voters about Trump until he , or another candidate , wins the support of a majority of delegates to the Convention .
Bernie Sanders is addressing supporters in Louisville , Kentucky .
The below live video feed should come online shortly .
So far itâ€ ™ s straight stump from Sanders .
Donald Trump is scheduled to discuss tonightâ€ ™ s victory at Trump Tower in Manhattan starting at 9 pm ET .
Ed Pilkington will be on the ground ...
Donald Trump has beaten Ted Cruz in the Indiana primary , ending the best hope of blocking a presidential nomination the Texas senator has claimed will plunge America into the political â€œabyssâ€ � , write the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs and Dan Roberts : Despite a day of dire warnings from Trumpâ€ ™ s conservative rival , the New York businessman was declared victor by the Associated Press within seconds of polls closing in the Hoosier state .
With the second highest number of delegates left on offer before the Republican party convention , Indiana offered a chance for Cruz to repeat his success in Iowa and Wisconsin by urging midwest voters to reject Trump .
â€œThe country is depending on Indiana , â€ � he warned on Tuesday .
â€œIf Indiana does not act , this country could well plunge into the abyss
â€
¦
We are not a proud , boastful , self - centered , mean spirited , hateful , bullying nation.â€ �
But by winning the 30 delegates awarded to Indianaâ€ ™ s statewide winner , Trump now has an easy path to claiming the 1,237 pledged delegates needed to avoid a contested convention in Cleveland and win outright , and is well - positioned even if Cruz pulls off an upset in delegate - rich California next month .
Read our full news coverage here : The governor John Kasich campaign has released a statement vowing not to let mere results alter the candidateâ€ ™ s steadfast commitment to somehow winning the nomination with 153 delegates ( and counting ? ) .
â€œTonightâ€
™ s results are not going to alter Gov. Kasichâ€ ™ s campaign plans , â€ � the statement begins , continuing : Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention .
The comments from Trump , on the verge of winning in Indiana , heighten the differences between Governor Kasich and his positive , inclusive approach and the disrespectful ramblings from Donald Trump .
The statement includes a colorful reference to â€œthe Mad Hatter Gibberish pushed by Trump during the primary , â€ � which Kasich believes â€œwould weaken America.â€

So much for a contested convention
: Trump continues to use the moment of his victory to punch Cruz , making sure he finishes the job with his opponent on the canvas : Trump is picking off district after district , snapping up at least 45 delegates in Indiana and angling for all 57 :
Indiana just confirmed everyoneâ€ ™ s worst fears , says Guardian US contributor Christopher R Barron .
Indiana is Waterloo for Ted Cruz and the # NeverTrump Forces .
For weeks , the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz and Trumpâ€ ™ s opponents circled today on the calendar .
Indiana was where they were making their last stand .
Like Wisconsin - where Cruz won - Indiana was meant to be friendlier territory for Cruz , somewhere he could focus his time and efforts .
After a huge loss in New York to Donald Trump and devastating losses in the so - called Acela primaries across the mid - Atlantic , it was hoped that Indiana would be the state where Donald Trump was stopped .
Thatâ€ ™ s not how it worked out .
Instead of stopping Trump , the Indiana primary became an electoral graveyard .
The anti - Trump movement poured millions into the state , Cruz fully brought to bear his vaunted ground game , he convinced rival John Kasich to not campaign in the state , he picked Carly Fiorina as his â€œrunning mate , â€ � and was even endorsed by Governor Mike Pence .
At the end of the day , none of it mattered .
Trump won and he won big .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
big win in Indiana now makes Trump the presumptive Republican nominee .
Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs is fanboating over the exit results and pulling in the good bits .
He notes that Hoosier men went big for Trump while the race was tight among women ... ...
Trump struggled with educated voters ... ...
but Trump performed better than usual among relatively affluent voters and not as well among low - income voters ( he nevertheless won both groups ) : In his moment of victory â€ “ like literally at the minute of his definitive victory in the presidential nominating competition
â€ “
Trump tweets not celebration but slams Cruz
: An immediate call in Indiana for Trump on the Republican side â€ “ and it appears there may be a possibility of a Trump delegate sweep .
Donald Trump is the likely 2016 Republican presidential nominee .
Thatâ€ ™ s not a technical term .
Itâ€ ™ s still possible it wonâ€ ™ t happen .
But .
Guardian US columnist Lucia Graves wonders whether tonight holds any surprises for Bernie Sanders , who is sticking in the race with a fighting spirit .
Hillary Clinton may have moved on to campaign in the general election , but Bernie Sanders isnâ€ ™ t giving up â€ “ and heâ€ ™ s hoping Indiana will tell the world tonight that his voters arenâ€ ™ t either .
While Sanders is overwhelmingly predicted to lose , the work and money heâ€
™ s
spending in Indiana suggest his team thinks he can perform better than expected .
The Vermont senator has a number of factors working in his favor tonight , including , crucially , that itâ€ ™ s an open primary , meaning Independents are allowed to vote .
The Sanders campaign spent generously in the days and weeks leading up to tonightâ€ ™ s primary and they did it at a time when team Clinton had essentially moved on .
Clinton tellingly spent zero money on advertising in Indiana while Sanders spent $ 1.5 m , and sheâ€ ™ s spent minimal time campaigning there .
Clinton further signaled her confidence by spending the day leading up to the election in Ohio â€ “ a state that has already voted in the primary and is useful to her only in so far as it pertains to the general .
With just under 5 % of votes reporting , tonightâ€ ™ s Democratic race is shaping up to be a tight one .
And while Clinton has the edge on Sanders thus far , early voting characteristically favors Clinton , whose campaign is better organized .
The math of the primary election may clear , but Sandersâ€ ™ constituency isnâ€ ™ t done talking yet .
With the closure of the final polling stations in Indiana in about five minutes , we are expected quickly to have at least one projected winner .
Ben Jacobs is in the room with team Cruz , where the senatorâ€ ™ s supporters are chanting at the TV :
Donâ€ ™ t make the mistake of neglecting our results page â€ “ weâ€ ™ re at 2.5 % reporting now on both sides , from mostly rural precincts , and Clinton and Trump appear to be performing well
: What will we learn when the last of the Indiana polls close in just 20 minutes ?
We havenâ€
™ t even had time to order pizza yet !
Roger Stone , the former Donald Trump adviser , current Trump ally and longtime Republican bruiser , tweets that CNNâ€ ™ s
Jake Tapper , in the spot we linked to earlier , is wrong about Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father and , by the way , Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill Kennedy : Ted Cruz for president , down to 2 % in betting pools .
Not down by 2 % .
Down to 2 % .
Here are a few good # ffs for snap results analysis : Forty precincts have now reported on each side â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s less than 1 % reporting .
Needless to say thatâ€ ™ s not a large enough proportion to base a projection on .
But not bad for Trump , it appears : Visit our comprehensive mapped results page here : Why would the Associated Press be circulating a video explaining how they might call a race in Indiana immediately as polls close ?
Hmmm ...
One precinct has let fly its results early .
And Clinton holds a 228-vote lead in Indiana .
Count it .
Hereâ€ ™ s Nate Cohn with a good reminder of why exit polls can be misleading
: they donâ€
™ t encompass early votes
â€ “ hundreds of thousands of them , in Indianaâ€ ™ s case tonight
: Donald Trump is a friend of mine .

Senator Ted Cruz , 7/18/15 Polling stations in 80 of 92 counties in Indiana are about to close .
Whatâ€ ™ s done is ( almost ) done .
Update : to be clear :
I t appears there is no way that Ted Cruz might leave the race tonight or any night soon
: Update :
Cruz suspends campaign : â€œIt appears that path [ to victory ] has been foreclosed.â€ �
Appearances are everything !
Correction : this post has been updated to reflect that some results will land before 7 pm ET .
Here is the kind of exit poll tidbit that an eyebrow might be raised at but which on the other hand might mean diddly depending on the reliability of the data which might be nil : â€œMany supporters of each candidate wouldnâ€ ™ t consider ultimately voting for the other , â€ � writes Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs :
Michael Strawn , a 52-year - old mortgage banker from Carmel , Indiana , who supports Cruz , told the Guardian : â€œDonald Trump scares me .
He is unpredictable and self - centered.â€ �
A lifelong Republican , Strawn said he would have a hard time voting for Trump if he was the nominee .
â€œI know what the worst case is with Hillary .
I donâ€ ™ t like it
but I can manage .
With Trump I just donâ€ ™
t know.â€

In contrast , Danny Buechler of Greenfield not only couldnâ€ ™ t imagine voting for Cruz , but he couldnâ€ ™ t imagine voting for anyone besides Trump .
The long - bearded biker , who wore a black cowboy hat with â€œTrumpâ€ � written in silver , said he had last voted for Richard Nixon in 1968 .
To him , the Republican frontrunner represented â€œtruth and changeâ€ � , and Buechler took reassurance in the fact that the mogul â€œainâ€ ™ t a politician yetâ€ � .
Read the full piece here : If you like results but donâ€ ™ t like waiting , youâ€ ™ re in luck , because exit poll data is now trickling out .
The data have been collected by interviewers outside polling stations across Indiana on behalf of a consortium of media outlets , and the data might shed light on the demographic and ideological breakdowns of todayâ€ ™ s electorate , which information then might be extrapolated to judge the candidatesâ€ ™ potential performances , is how it works .
You can root through the data for kernels of potential insight here , but be warned â€ “ those kernels might in fact be misleading nonsense , the result of bad voter sampling or inaccurate self - reporting by voters .
Still , it is interesting to contemplate that the proportion of # NeverTrump voters in the Republican race may have been smaller , actually , than the proportion of voters who said they were # NeverCruz :

3 May 2016 witnessed some of the most outlandish lines ever to surface in the national political discourse , which is saying something .
Donald Trump started things off by calling into Fox News and giving credence to a months - old story in the National Enquirer â€ “ think celebrity alien baby births and John Edwardsâ€ ™ affair â€ “ that Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father , Rafael Cruz Sr . , had been captured on camera with Lee Harvey Oswald , who assassinated president John F Kennedy .
â€œWhat was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death , I mean before the shooting?â€ �
Trump said .
( Thereâ€ ™ s no reason apart from the sterling journalistic reputation of the Enquirer , which has endorsed Trump and is published by a friend of Trumpâ€ ™ s , to believe the man in the picture in question is indeed Cruzâ€ ™ s father . )
Cruz replied in a midday news conference that snowballed into a full - throated condemnation of Trump , whom Cruz called a â€œpathological liarâ€ � and a â€œserial philandererâ€ � whose â€œbattles with venereal diseaseâ€ � were not the kind of thing Americans would like their teenagers to contemplate .
Hereâ€ ™ s Cruzâ€ ™ s sizzler : Trump hit back , saying Cruz was in the last throes of a â€œdesperateâ€ � attempt to save his â€œfailing campaign ,
â€ � accusing him of a â€œridiculous outburstâ€ � and saying he did not â€œhave the temperament to be president.â€

From there , Cruz heads west :
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the Indiana primaries , where Donald Trump is hoping to kick his ankles free of Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s teeth , and Hillary Clinton is hoping to avoid another unseemly Bernie Sanders win .
The stakes on the Republican side tonight can not be overstated .
If Trump wins the 30 delegates that Indiana awards the victor in the stateâ€ ™ s popular vote ( the winners in each of the stateâ€ ™ s nine congressional districts receive three delegates apiece ) , only a huge upset by Cruz in California next month could stop Trump from obtaining the 1,237 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination .
Tonightâ€ ™ s the night that Donald Trump could become the likely 2016 Republican presidential nominee .
Polling averages have Trump up by double digits in the Hoosier state , while Clinton holds a smaller and less extensively surveyed lead over Sanders ( with 83 pledged delegates to be awarded on the Democratic side ) .
But Clinton , who holds a prohibitive lead in the delegate race , is already leaving the primary season behind and training her fire on Trump : Most polling stations in Indiana , which straddles two time zones , close at 6 pm ET , with the remainder closing at 7 pm ET .
In 2012 , half the Indiana vote had been reported by 8 pm ET , and 95 % by 10 pm ET , according to the Associated Press .
A very high rate of absentee ballots , which were requested in unusual volume , have been returned in Indiana , NBC News reported .
It was a strange day on the campaign trail , even for the 2016 cycle , with Trump starting off by linking Cruzâ€ ™ s father to the JFK assassination and Cruz trotting out an old Trump quote about venereal disease .
Weâ€ ™ ll bring you a recap of that action shortly â€ “ or you can scroll through todayâ€ ™ s Campaign Minute or enjoy Scott Bixbyâ€ ™ s daytime live blog .
As usual , weâ€ ™ ll be tracking the results on our interactive maps tool and bringing you the headline returns here as soon as they come in .
Do you think Sanders will pull off an upset ?
Is there any chance of Cruz doing the same ?
Wherefore John Kasich ?
Hereâ€ ™ s how the delegate races currently stack up

2016-05-03,"Never mind the Zodiac killer .
Donald Trump has linked Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father to JFKâ€ ™ s killer .
â€œWhat was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death , I mean before the shooting?â€ �
Trump said .
In a last - ditch effort to reverse the polls in Indiana â€ “ a contest that could effectively decide the GOP race â€ “ Cruz called Trump a â€œserial philandererâ€ � and dug up an old Trump quote about STDs .
Heâ€

I want everyone to think about your teenage kids .
The president â€ ¦ describes his battles with venereal disease as his â€˜own personal Vietnamâ€ ™ .
Thatâ€ ™ s a quote , by the way .

Poll : Dems want more Bern"
2016-05-04,"When Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican presidential race after losing in Indiana , he said there was no â€œviable path to victoryâ€ � .
But , really , anybody who isnâ€ ™ t a Republican would probably tell you something different : it was the handshake .
And probably also that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac killer .
This Vine of Cruz fumbling toward a â€œtriumphantâ€ � hand clasp with running mate
Carly Fiorina has been viewed more than 3.5 m times ( even though we assume most people viewed it more than once ) .
Itâ€ ™ s been edited from the original video to highlight the strangeness : tendril fingers slithering and grasping awkwardly for each other , like Cthulhu hand puppets .
It takes an unbearably long time for the pair to get their fists into the air .
There are so many incarnations of the original moment constellating across Twitter , Facebook and other platforms that itâ€ ™ s impossible to track its penetration â€ “ but empirically , itâ€ ™ s quite difficult to avoid .
Itâ€ ™ s probably absurd to assume that one internet meme could end someoneâ€ ™ s political career .
But what about lots of them ?
â€œSkewered by social media
memesâ€ � is the essential story of the Cruz campaign , and the gleeful and prolific satires of the ordinary citizensâ€ ™ online community surely played a role in exaggerating the candidateâ€ ™ s inherent strangeness , sketching him as a grotesque figure vulnerable to his rivals .
Aside from the persistent and fascinating Zodiac killer meme galleries , here are 13 characters and animals that purportedly look like Cruz , including a blobfish , Grandpa Munster , the Penguin from Batman , and â€œdogs stung by beesâ€ � .
Letâ€ ™ s add one more : this famous drawing of Franceâ€ ™ s King Louis Philippe , in a political cartoon by Honore Daumier dating all the way back to 1803 .
The unflattering lithograph , called Gargantua , was a protest of corruption and was obscene for its time , depicting Philippe gobbling bags of gold that flow uphill to his gaping mouth .
The artist was jailed for his trouble â€ “ but the work remains an example of the early impact of political cartoons , which came into their own as a form during the 1800s .
For the first time in a US election cycle , community - generated memes have grown to play a significant role in political discourse , similar to the classic printed cartoon .
The anarchic , youth - led online shorthand â€ “ which can encompass images with text captions , familiar iconography repurposed in multiple contexts , or even short animations such as gifs and Vines â€
“ is no longer just for young people on image boards and in closed groups .
In fact , it may even be a sign of how politically engaged young people are today : theyâ€ ™ re generating their own image - based political satires .
In these memes , the political figure is exaggerated , his context made grotesque or fantastical , just as in traditional political cartooning .
If we agree that memes have played some role , even a small one , in dispossessing the Cruz campaign of dignity , then we can also look at how memes have helped rally disenfranchised youth around progressive candidate Bernie Sanders .
A Facebook group called Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash ( where â€œdankâ€ � is an ironic synonym for cool ) has close to 450,000 members devoted mostly to pro - Sanders memes â€ “ and to those skewering Cruz , Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in mostly equal measure .
One of the most popular meme formats that went viral thanks to the group is called â€œBernie or Hillary?â€ � , which depicts a fake campaign poster comparing the two candidatesâ€ ™ stances on popular culture topics : Bernie is usually depicted as being relatable or knowledgeable on the issue , while Hillary gives an embarrassing stock answer .
Hillary believes the Olive Garden is â€œAn authentic Italian restaurant for the whole familyâ€ � while Bernieâ€ ™ s view is â€œOnly when Iâ€ ™ m high.â€
�
My personal favorite incarnation depicts Bernie with a traditional Royal Dansk tin full of actual butter cookies , while Hillary classically uses hers to hold sewing equipment .
Itâ€ ™ s so subtle , recapturing the childhood disappointment of finding something boring instead of a treat .
The memes are funny , but theyâ€ ™ re also precise and insightful caricatures of actual reservations regarding one liberal candidate versus another .
Ultimately the community is more than a humor group ; the idiosyncratic satirist CARLES not - so - jokingly suggested that Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash could be â€œa safe haven for those who need reinforcement from non - establishment media
streamsâ€ � .
According to the online meme library Know Your Meme , the Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash was created in October 2015 by college students Will Dowd and Sean Walsh .
Meme scientist Ari Spool , who spent many years researching and cataloguing memes at Know
Your Meme ( though she recently joined Giphy as community curator ) , has studied the BSDMS closely and notes that age polls that take place in the group seem to suggest participants
â€œoverwhelminglyâ€ � volunteer their age as 18 to 21 .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a completely different generation than those who voted for Obama the first time ,
â€ � she says .
â€œThese kids donâ€
™ t remember 9/11 ; all they have felt were aftershocks , and the effects on their older siblings , the millennials .
Our college debt is something they see and understand the full breadth of before they even get into a school , and our difficulty in finding quality work is something they see , too .
Letâ€ ™ s not even get started on institutional racism ; I didnâ€ ™ t have a newsfeed in high school but they do , and itâ€ ™ s making them â€˜woke afâ€
™
.â€ �
The engagement around memes as political cartoons may even suggest a more passionate youth vote than ever .
â€œYoung people are incredibly engaged in political speech , but they are very often thwarted by a system that refuses to support them physically .
â€
¦ You have to show up in person to vote , the system favors the old and stable over the young and unstable , â€ � says Spool , who once campaigned for mayor in New York City .
â€œI think if you analyze what these memes are saying about Bernie , itâ€ ™ s that people are excited because he doesnâ€ ™ t reflect the system thatâ€ ™ s currently in place.â€ �
Nonetheless , there are memes alternately celebrating and denigrating any candidate ; the Texts From Hillary meme , in contrast to the tenor of the BSDMS , uses an image of Clinton wearing sunglasses and texting to present her as competent and in charge ( â€œHi Hil , whatchu doing ,
â€ �
Obama texts ; â€œRunning the world ,
â€ � she replies ) .
Thereâ€ ™ s even a Ted Cruz Meme Page that up until now has been dedicated to earnestly pro - Cruz memes ( Keep Calm and Cruz
On is one ) but as of the candidateâ€ ™ s exit is devoted to anti - Trump ones .
These new communal political cartoons are a clear component of the present landscape â€ “ though their impact is harder to quantify ( while Facebook networks swelled with anti - Trump memes and disturbing gifs , he imperviously became the presumptive Republican nominee ) .
â€œThe meme universe is all about mutability , and the flexibility to express your opinion , â€ �
Spool says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not just about Bernie and Hillary , but whatever the other element in the meme is .
Thatâ€ ™ s what makes it fun.â€ �"
2016-05-04,"Fresh off an overwhelming victory in Indiana that made him the presumptive Republican nominee , Donald Trump wasted little time in previewing his tactics against Hillary Clinton in a general election .
Trump has spent the last year batting away his Republican opponents , largely by turning them into caricatures .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was â€œlow - energyâ€ � , Florida senator Marco Rubio was
â€œLittle Marcoâ€ � and Texas senator Ted Cruz , who suspended his campaign on Tuesday , â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � .
Former secretary of state Clinton will be known as â€œCrooked Hillaryâ€ � .
During an interview with MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe on Wednesday , Trump attached several other labels to his likely opponent .
She was â€œunqualifiedâ€ � , he said , and â€œshould sufferâ€ � for her use of a private email server while in office .
The system was â€œriggedâ€ � in her favor .
â€œShe should not be allowed to run in the election , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œShe should suffer like other people have suffered who have done far less than she has â€ ¦
and here she is running for president like nothing happened.â€
�
The former reality TV star invoked comments last month by the other remaining Democratic candidate , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , that Clinton was â€œunqualifiedâ€ � to be president .
â€œBernie Sanders said sheâ€ ™ s got poor judgment , â€ �
Trump said .
Sanders made his remarks as tensions escalated before the 19 April primary in New York .
The senator later walked back his statement , but not before it had been seized upon by Republicans .
The challenge for those Republicans , though , remains that as far as Trump is concerned , nothing is off limits â€ “ even if it risks turning off large swaths of voters .
The real estate mogul has already dug up Clintonâ€ ™ s past : earlier this year , dredging up the Monica Lewinsky scandal , he likened former president Bill Clinton to a sexual predator .
Also , last week , he handed Clinton a rallying cry by saying she was playing â€œthe woman cardâ€ � and had little else to offer than her gender .
Clintonâ€ ™ s team responded with a full - scale â€œwoman cardâ€ � fundraising drive that raised $ 2.4 m in three days , 40 % of which her campaign said came from first - time donors .
Such moments offer Clinton a chance to appeal to Republicans frustrated by what they view as the breakdown of their party .
Some GOP strategists in Washington were willing to declare their support for Clinton as early as Tuesday , when it became apparent that Trump would win Indiana and all but end the prospect of a contested convention in July .
The Clinton campaign on Wednesday circulated a list featuring some of them , as well as quotes from other Republican lawmakers and prominent conservatives who said they would never back Trump .
To further its case that Trump is unpalatable to his own party , Team Clinton released a new web video in the afternoon compiling footage of Trumpâ€ ™ s former Republican opponents attacking him on the stump and in interviews .
Featured in the video are Cruz referring to Trump as â€œutterly immoralâ€ � ; Florida senator Marco Rubio blasting him as a â€œcon artistâ€
� and â€œthe most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidencyâ€ � ; former Florida governor Jeb Bush saying â€œhe needs therapyâ€ � ; and multiple clips from an anti - Trump speech delivered earlier this year by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney .
Although Clinton has long made it a staple of her stump speeches to condemn Trump as a demagogue , in particular regarding his anti - immigration and anti - Muslim rhetoric , it was only last week that her campaign began to pivot toward the general election in earnest .
The campaign named state directors in key battleground states , seeking to turn its attention to a ground operation geared for the general election â€ “ a critical area in which Trump may lag behind .
And while Clinton has continued to campaign in primary states , she made a stop on Tuesday in the must - win general election state of Ohio , to pitch her economic agenda .
Many working - class white voters in the so - called Rust Belt have been drawn to the populist appeal of both Sanders and Trump .
During his victory speech on Tuesday , echoing once more an attack used by Sanders , Trump launched into a critique of Clintonâ€ ™ s record on trade by tying her to Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s landmark North American Free Trade Agreement .
To win back the White House , Republicans will nonetheless need to secure more than a majority of white voters .
With a nominee whose unfavorability ratings position him as the least - popular nominee of either party in modern history , and whose primary campaign has alienated nearly every other demographic in the country , that will remain an uphill climb ."
2016-05-04,"Donald Trump has finally secured a clear path to the Republican presidential nomination as his last remaining party rival signalled he would drop out of the race on Wednesday .
Governor John Kasich of Ohio will formally quit the race with a statement in his home state at 5 pm , following Texas senator Ted Cruz by stepping aside for Trump .
The sudden capitulation sets up a November battle between Trump and Hillary Clinton for the White House , even though Bernie Sanders stayed alive in the Democratic race with a surprise win on Tuesday night in the Indiana primary .
Kasichâ€ ™ s withdrawal , confirmed to the Guardian by a senior campaign source , marks the formal end of the most crowded and controversial race for a US presidential nomination in modern political history .
The decision , made while Kasichâ€ ™ s plane was waiting on the tarmac at Columbus airport ahead of a planned fundraising trip , followed a similar announcement by his better - placed opponent Ted Cruz , who suspended his own campaign at an emotional press conference in Indiana on Tuesday night .
â€œFrom the beginning Iâ€ ™ ve said I will continue on as long as there is a viable path to victory â€ “ tonight I am sorry to say it appears that math has been foreclosed , â€ � said Cruz .
As the crowd shouted â€œno , noâ€ � , Cruz told attendees : â€œTogether we left it out on the field .
We gave it everything we got .
But the voters chose another path , and so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long - term future of our nation we are suspending our campaign.â€ �
Using the word â€œsuspensionâ€ � to describe such decisions is typically a technicality designed to preserve a candidateâ€ ™ s legal ability to continue raising funds while the campaign winds up .
Both Cruz and Kasich bowed to the near mathematical certainty that Trump will now win a clear majority of delegates , reaching the 1,237 threshold needed to clinch the nomination .
And they also acknowledged calls by the Republican National Committee to unite around the â€œpresumptive nomineeâ€ � .
But the scale of the political reconciliation required for this to happen was made clear on Wednesday when Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire â€ “ one of several moderate senators facing a bumpy re - election with Trump at the top of the party ballot in November â€
“ said she would be â€œsupporting , but not endorsingâ€ � his candidacy .
Arizona senator John McCain , another previously vocal opponent of Trump , said he would support the partyâ€ ™ s nominee , but initially declined to refer to him directly by name .
A former speechwriter for McCain , who was the party nominee in 2008 , said he would rather vote for Hillary Clinton than Trump .
Many party leaders , including opponents in the primary , will now be under similar pressure to announce their support for Trump , despite months of public misgivings about his lack of political experience , attacks on women and minorities , and poor polling numbers among independent voters .
Despite fervent support among Republican primary votes , Trump suffers from the worst national opinion poll ratings of any candidate of either party since at least 1984 , with 67 % of Americans thinking of him unfavorably .
Earlier on Wednesday , despite barely registering in Indiana , where he had encouraged supporters to vote for Cruz , Kasich issued a defiant statement suggesting he would continue to contest remaining primary elections .
Taking his cue from the â€œMay the Fourthâ€ � Star Wars celebration , Kasich released a spoof video to the filmâ€ ™ s theme tune describing a nightmare scenario for Republicans in which Trumpâ€ ™ s nomination ushers not just a Clinton landslide , but allows Democrats to win back control of the House of Representatives and Senate .
â€œThe country is depending on Indiana , â€ � added Cruz on Tuesday before the primary results came in .
â€œIf Indiana does not act , this country could well plunge into the abyss
â€
¦
We are not a proud , boastful , self - centered , mean - spirited , hateful , bullying nation.â€ �
But Trump swept his opponents before him in the Hoosier State , clinching 53 % of the votes and almost all the delegates as his strident attacks on free trade agreements and immigration appeared to resonate in a midwest state hit hard by globalisation .
The New York billionaire is almost certain to face Clinton in Novemberâ€ ™ s election , but voters in Indiana also showed her difficulties in fighting this economic populism .
Her Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders threw a last - minute hurdle in front of Clintonâ€ ™ s march toward the Democratic party nomination on Tuesday by clinching a surprise victory in the Indiana primary .
Despite trailing by an average of seven points in opinion polls and losing a string of bigger , more diverse states on the east coast , Sanders once again proved his appeal to disaffected midwest voters by pulling off his 18th victory of 2016 , winning 52.7 % of the votes to Clintonâ€ ™ s 47.3 % .
â€œThe Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over , â€ � said Sanders . â€œTheyâ€ ™ re wrong .
Maybe itâ€ ™ s over for the insiders and the party establishment , but the voters in Indiana had a different idea.â€ �
Nonetheless , the former secretary of state is nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of her Vermont rival and within less than 200 delegates of crossing the finish line including the controversial superdelegates â€ “ party figures who are able to vote independently of election results and overwhelmingly back Clinton .
Choosing to focus on her Republican opponent , Clinton pointedly ignored the surprise Sanders upset in favor of a full frontal attack on Trump .
â€œChip in now if you agree we canâ€ ™ t let him become president , â€ �
she urged her supporters in a swift fundraising email .
And later on Wednesday , Clinton took to Twitter to unveil a new â€œLove trumps hateâ€ � slogan , declaring : â€œUnity versus division , compassion versus selfishness and love versus hate .
The stakes donâ€ ™ t get much higher.â€ �"
2016-05-04,"Weâ€ ™ re going to wrap up our live coverage of the Indiana primaries shortly .
Hereâ€ ™ s what happened :
Donald Trump emerged as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee with a resounding victory in Indiana , as Ted Cruz suspended his presidential campaign .
Bernie Sanders scored an upset victory over Hillary Clinton , though the two split the delegate pile .
Sanders vowed the nominating race was not over .
Cruz did not mention Trump as he mothballed his campaign but called for the Republican party to look to the far horizon ( his 2020 bid ? ) .
â€œIâ€ ™ m sorry to say , it appears that path [ to victory ] has been foreclosed , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œWe gave it everything weâ€ ™ ve got.â€ �
Trump praised Cruz as â€œone hell of a competitorâ€ � and â€œa tough , smart guyâ€ � .
It was a change in tone from the morning , when he had suggested Cruzâ€ ™ s father had had a hand in the JFK assassination and Cruz had brought up Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œbattles with venereal diseaseâ€ � .
Republican party chair Reince Priebus called Trump the â€œpresumptive nomineeâ€ � .
Trump said : â€œWe want to bring unity to the Republican party.â€ �
Many Republicans resisted that call , vowing on social media to support Clinton or , in any case , not to support Trump .
Clinton invited supporters to â€œchip in now if you agree we canâ€ ™ t let [ Trump ] become presidentâ€ � .
John Kasichâ€ ™ s campaign said he was staying in :
â€œTonightâ€ ™ s results are not going to alter Governor Kasichâ€ ™ s campaign plans.â€

Cruz did not depart the national stage gracefully , exactly , elbowing his wife in the face on the way :
And some covers of tomorrowâ€ ™ s papers have already popped up :"
2016-05-04,"Trump , Sanders triumph in Indiana Donald Trump continued his march to the Republican nomination , sweeping Indiana and knocking out Ted Cruz , who suspended his campaign .
Trump offered an uncommonly gracious tribute to his departing rival .

2016-05-04,"In his first sitdown interview as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , Donald Trump refused to back down on his longstanding â€ “ and long - since debunked â€ “ claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States , and also refused to denounce antisemitic attacks on a journalist who wrote a profile about his wife .
Speaking to CNNâ€ ™ s Wolf Blitzer , Trump doubled down on some of his most controversial and inflammatory positions , claiming his statements about the presidentâ€ ™ s nationality or his attempts to link the father of former rival Ted Cruz to the assassination of John F Kennedy were proportional to attacks waged against himself .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve given up a tremendous amount to run for president , â€ �
Trump told Blitzer .
â€œI gave up two more seasons of Celebrity Apprentice.â€
�
Blitzer asked Trump specifically to address his supporters who had sent
â€œviciousâ€ � messages to journalist Julia Ioffe this week .
After her profile of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s wife , Melania , appeared in this monthâ€ ™ s issue of GQ , the Russian - American journalist received a torrent of antisemitic and threatening messages from supporters of the Republican frontrunner .
â€œI donâ€
™ t have a message to the fans â€ “ Iâ€ ™ m not gon na talk about that , â€ � Trump said , calling Ioffeâ€ ™ s story â€œnastyâ€ � and defending his wife against unspecified falsehoods in the piece .
â€œShe doesnâ€ ™ t need to have bad things said about her , â€ � he said of his wife .
Trump protested that he knew nothing of any antisemitic or abusive comments and threats directed at Ioffe .
When Blitzer asked Trump about his past support of â€œbirtherismâ€ � â€ “ the fervent and unsubstantiated belief that Obama was secretly born outside of the United States and is therefore constitutionally ineligible for the presidency , Trump pinned his past statements on his likely opponent in the general election : Hillary Clinton .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s the one who started it ,
â€ �
Trump said .
The billionaire has long argued that the former secretary of state was the instigator in the birther movement , although evidence for this assertion has not surfaced .
Trump , whose senior campaign staff have intimated to Republican party leadership that the candidate would moderate his tone in the general election , also refused to walk back statements on other hot - button issues , including his signature proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigration into the United States .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know , I mean , look , I donâ€ ™ t know ,
â€ �
Trump said , when Blitzer asked if such a proposal would alienate Americaâ€ ™ s allies in the Middle East .
â€œThe migration is a disaster â€ “ weâ€ ™ re letting in thousands of people .
They donâ€
™ t have documentation , they donâ€
™ t have paperwork , we donâ€
™ t know who they are or where they come from.â€ �
In an interview with the New York Times Trump said he would implement the ban within his first 100 days , the paper reported .
He also declared that his suggestion that US troop presence in friendly nations should be subsidized was still a key feature of his proposed national security platform .
â€œIf theyâ€ ™ re not going to take care of us properly , we can not afford to police the entire world ,
â€ �
Trump said , when asked if he would allow Japan and South Korea to become nuclear powers .
â€œIâ€
™ m prepared to walk , and if they donâ€ ™ t take care of us properly ...
theyâ€ ™ re gon na have to defend themselves.â€ �
When Blitzer quoted a military estimate that it might cost more money to house American troops in the US than in Japan , Trump implied that perhaps those troops were redundant .
â€œMaybe you donâ€ ™ t need them .
Maybe you donâ€ ™ t need them.â€ �"
2016-05-05,"Ted Cruz did everything right in his campaign for the White House .
He built a happy campaign operation that achieved all of its ambitious goals .
Cruz elbowed out candidate after candidate to consolidate support among social conservatives , Tea Partiers and libertarians in the Republican field .
He raised considerable amounts of money to build a political apparatus unrivalled in the GOP field .
There was only one problem .
Every successful move , every stratagem that took Cruz â€ “ who dropped out of the presidential race on Tuesday night after a disastrous loss in Indiana â€ “ from an ambitious Ivy Leaguer to one of the final three Republican candidates for the presidency prevented him from attaining the ultimate goal .
The Texas Republican was elected to the Senate in 2012 after winning a bitter primary as a Tea Party candidate .
He was positioning himself for a White House bid almost from the get - go , travelling to Iowa for presidential cattle calls less than six months into taking office .
In a legislative body that values tradition , Cruzâ€ ™ s undisguised ambition
didnâ€
™ t help him make friends .
But what really alienated colleagues was his push to shut down the government in October 2013 in an attempt to defund Obamacare ,
the presidentâ€ ™ s signature healthcare reforms .
The quixotic effort alienated almost all of his colleagues who were left calling him a â€œwacko birdâ€ � and viewed him as an amoral opportunist who would do anything for his own political gain .
Cruz did nothing to alter his image when he became the first candidate for the White House in 2016 to announce his campaign , in an event at Liberty University in Virginia in March last year .
He was then racing to beat competitors with stronger roots in Iowa â€ “ such as Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee â€ “ to be the first out of the starting gate .
Cruzâ€ ™ s message that day was consistent with what the Texas senator would say every day on the campaign trail until the moment he withdrew from the race in Indianapolis on Tuesday .
He told a crowd of college students : â€œI believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of Americaâ€ � and pledged to â€œreclaim the constitutionâ€ � .
In fact , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign was remarkable for its consistency .
There was only one key issue on which Cruz changed his message significantly in the course of the campaign â€ “ Donald J Trump .
For months after Trumpâ€ ™ s entry into the race , Cruz engaged in a virtual bear hug with the New York billionaire .
Immediately after Trump said that Cruzâ€ ™ s Senate colleague John McCain , a former POW who was tortured in Vietnam , was not a hero , Cruz called him a friend .
He told reporters in Iowa in July 2015 : â€œI recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican on Republican violence .
So you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump or bad about John McCain or bad about anybody else .
I am not going to do it .
John McCain is a friend of mine .
I respect and admire him .
He is an American hero .
Donald Trump is a friend of mine.â€ �
In contrast , the then candidate Rick Perry immediately condemned Trump and called on him to drop out of the race .
This pattern continued throughout 2015 .
As late as December , Cruz even tweeted that he thought Trump was terrific â€ “ long after other candidates had begun to condemn the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s rhetoric .
But eventually , after Cruzâ€ ™ s win in the Iowa caucuses , the two turned to focus on each other .
Cruz targeted Trump as a â€œNew York liberalâ€ � who was no more a conservative than Hillary Clinton .
After Trump had endured months of attacks for failing to adhere to conservative orthodoxy , this had little impact .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s labelling of Cruz as â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � â€ “ based on the campaign rushing to inform Iowans that Ben Carson might drop out of the race after misconstruing a report on CNN just minutes before the caucuses were scheduled to begin â€ “ did have some effect .
The result was that exit poll after exit poll showed that voters thought Cruz ran a dirtier campaign than Trump and the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s favorability numbers dropped with Republicans .
This happened even though the most personal attacks came from Trump , not Cruz .
Trump tweeted an unflattering image of Cruzâ€ ™ s wife and threatened to â€œspill the beans on herâ€
�
and , on the day of the Indiana primary , implied Cruzâ€ ™ s
father was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy .
A campaign surrogate even repeatedly referenced a totally unproven tabloid story about Cruzâ€ ™ s personal life at multiple Trump rallies In contrast , Cruz insisted that he was merely going after Trumpâ€ ™ s record when he slammed the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s past support for abortion rights and gun control and current support for allowing grown men â€œalone in bathrooms with little girlsâ€ � , ie his contention that transgender people should use whichever bathroom they felt appropriate .
Like other candidates in the race , Cruz had no way to cope with Trumpâ€ ™ s strange political jujitsu .
Even as Cruz out - organized Trump on the ground , it was to little avail .
The Texas senatorâ€ ™
s campaign concentrated on Illinois in the final days before the 15 March primary after poll numbers showed him solidly ahead in North Carolina and Missouri .
However , the backlash among Republican voters after unrest at a canceled Trump rally in Chicago led to the frontrunner surging in the polls there , and Cruz was shut out in those crucial primaries as a result .
Cruzâ€ ™ s only hope was to somehow unite the GOP behind him .
As the last remaining opponent to Trump , he should have been the standard bearer for the Stop Trump forces , and indeed some longtime detractors like Lindsey Graham â€ “ who had joked about him being murdered on the Senate floor just a week earlier â€ “ begrudgingly endorsed him .
As Jimmy Kimmel joked to Cruz in late March : â€œYeah , what you did is you kind of held out until they found someone that they liked less than you.â€ �
Cruz responded by saying : â€œThere you go .
It is a powerful strategy.â€
�
The problem was the strategy
didnâ€
™ t work .
The antagonism Cruz inspired among many mainstream Republicans made this a near impossible task .
They sat on their hands and viewed Cruz as just as bad as Trump .
The same factors that got him to the brink of the Republican nomination , his disdain for the â€œWashington cartelâ€ � and impatience with politics as usual , kept him from grasping the ring .
After a campaign in which he appealed to conservatives who were tired of voting for the lesser of two evils , Cruz could never win over those establishment Republicans he had spent the past year calling the lesser evil .
That became undeniable this Tuesday ."
2016-05-05,"The way is now clear for Donald Trump to become the 2016 Republican nominee after John Kasich suspended his presidential campaign on Wednesday , following Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s decision to bow out the night before .
Some 67 % of Americans have an unfavourable view of Trump â€ “ making him the most disliked party - nominee since 1984 â€ “ and weâ€ ™ d like to know what voters really think about his victory .
Key voting groups view Trump â€œstrongly unfavourablyâ€ � , including 74 % of under 40-year - olds , 75 % of women , and 81 % of Hispanics .
Inside the Republican party there is a gender gap , with 47 % of Republican women viewing Trump positively compared to 64 % of Republican men .
His racist comments towards Hispanics and Muslims , and his controversial immigration policies , are well documented .
Yet despite the negativity surrounding him , he is still winning votes .
Cruz warned that a Trump victory in Indiana on Tuesday would â€œplunge America into a political abyssâ€ � .
But despite his persistently unfavourable ratings Trump believes he is â€œgoing to win in November .
And we are going to win big.â€ �

2016-05-05,"Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for president , his victory in Indiana on Tuesday having pushed Ted Cruz and John Kasich from the race .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t mean the remaining primaries are canceled .
Over the next month , Republican voters will go to the polls in 10 states where Cruz and Kasich are still on the ballot .
If a candidate drops out , their name is not automatically removed .
In California , for example , Kasich , Cruz , Ben Carson and former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore will all be on the ballot .
This means there is ample opportunity for the casting of protest votes .
The Trump campaign , however , has bigger worries .
In many states the delegate selection process is still going on .
Trump must still ensure that delegates chosen to attend the convention in Cleveland in July will be amenable to his cause .
The former senator Bob Dole will attend , as the only former presidential nominee to do so .
On Thursday a representative for the 92-year - old would not say he would support Trump .
This was not surprising
â€ “ Trump has generated significant rancor within the party .
If such rancor continues , there are still viable if highly unlikely ways to prevent him from receiving the nomination .
If , for example , Trump opponents controlled the Republican rules committee , they could pass changes to allow delegates to follow their conscience on the first ballot , potentially making it difficult for Trump to reach the 1,237-delegate threshold needed to secure the nomination .
Furthermore , even if Republicans come to terms with Trump , the partyâ€ ™ s platform committee could cause considerable problems .
To most Republicans Trumpâ€
™ s views are heterodox , to say the least â€ “ the platform would need significant massaging to appease both Trump and longtime conservative activists .
Any conflicts could cause considerable drama and create even more issues between Trump and party loyalists .
After all , even Mitt Romney had difficulties with the partyâ€ ™ s platform in 2012 , over politically sensitive language on abortion .
In 2016 , there is significantly greater tension between the nominee and the base ."
2016-05-05,"Trump tries to bury the hatchet Donald Trump will today begin the process of pulling together the Republican party , add staff for a national campaign , try to seduce donors heâ€ ™ s alienated , and stem the loss of party faithful to likely Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , following his installation as presumptive GOP nominee with Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s and John Kasichâ€ ™ s withdrawals from the race .
George HW and George W Bush , the only two living former Republican presidents , as well as several senators including Dean Heller of Nevada and Ben Sasse of Nebraska , have all made clear they will not endorse him .
Trump meanwhile is floating the idea that he is will consider former opponent Ted Cruz as his vice - presidential pick .
He praised Cruz as â€œa capable guyâ€ � only 24 hours after he questioned whether Cruzâ€ ™ s father was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy , and Cruz called Trump â€œtotally amoralâ€ � .
Trump told the New York Times he would implement his plan to ban Muslims for the US and produce designs for a Mexican wall within his first 100 days as president .
He also told CNN he had sacrificed two seasons of Celebrity Apprentice to run for president .
Ben Jacobs looks back on Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign , which ended on Tuesday night after his loss in Indiana : â€œEvery successful move , every stratagem that took Cruz â€ “ who dropped out of the presidential race on Tuesday night after a disastrous loss in Indiana â€ “ from an ambitious Ivy Leaguer to one of the final three Republican candidates for the presidency prevented him from attaining the ultimate goal , â€ � he writes .

2016-05-06,"Democrats spent the last 10 months seeking to define Republicans as the â€œParty of Trumpâ€ � .
This week , what was once dismissed as a fever dream became a reality .
Following a crushing victory in the Indiana primary and the suspension by Ted Cruz and John Kasich of their presidential campaigns , Donald Trump was left as the last Republican standing in what seems an inevitable contest against Hillary Clinton in November .
And even as Republicans began to openly anguish over whether they could rally behind Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy , Democrats made clear the message they will carry to the American electorate over the next six months : Donald Trump is the Republican Party .
The former reality TV star , who has all but secured the nomination , stands to be the least popular presidential nominee in modern history .
And the Democratic political organization that will now work to defeat him â€ “ from the race for the White House to the battle over control of the US Congress â€ “ believes its secret weapon against Trump is the billionaire himself .
The question is simply where to begin .
In its own opening salvo , the Clinton campaign allowed Republicans to do the talking themselves in a brutal web video released on the day after Trump was declared the presumptive nominee .
The digital spot was , in many ways , a Greatest Hits compilation featuring Trumpâ€ ™ s former primary opponents .
It featured , among others , Florida senator Marco Rubio referring to Trump as â€œa con artistâ€ � and â€œthe most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidencyâ€ � , former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney dubbing him as â€œa misogynistâ€ � and Texas senator Ted Cruz stating the bombastic billionaire was â€œutterly immoralâ€ � .
The archives are seemingly endless , as are the series of controversial statements made by Trump over the course of the primary season .
The real estate mogul infamously launched his bid for the White House nearly a year ago with the declaration that most Mexicans crossing over the US border were â€œrapistsâ€ � and â€œkillersâ€ � .
He later mocked a disabled reporter , proposed to ban all Muslims from entering the US , refused to immediately disavow the endorsement of a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan , and suggested women should be punished for having abortions .
â€œThis is a candidate who has tried to divide the country by race , by gender , by ethnicity , by body type , by age , â€ � said Justin Barasky , the communications director of the pro - Clinton Super Pac Priorities USA .
â€œThere are very few groups of people that he hasnâ€ ™ t offended.â€ �
Priorities USA had already reserved $ 70 m in television advertising across seven key battleground states â€ “ Ohio , Florida , Virginia , Nevada , Colorado , Iowa and New Hampshire â€ “ to begin after the Democratic convention in July and run through the general election .
The Super Pac also plans to pour at least $ 35 m into digital ads aimed at reaching the coalition of voters that have helped propel Democrats to victory in recent election cycles : African Americans , Hispanics , millennials and women .
It also teamed up with Emilyâ€ ™ s List , a Democratic group that works to elect pro - choice women to public office , to raise and spend $ 20 m to reach millennial women voters , a key voting block that could also be instrumental to electing Americaâ€ ™ s first female president .
â€œThe most powerful way to run against a candidate is to use their words against them , and with Trump , we have decades of offensive , misogynistic comments at our disposal , â€ � said Emilyâ€ ™ s List spokeswoman Marcy Stech .
â€œWomen voters across the board already dislike him , but it will be up to millennial women who hold the power to keep Trump from the White House .
Itâ€ ™ s not enough to dislike him â€
“
we have to get out and vote our power.â€
�
Women , broadly speaking , hold some of the most unfavorable views of Trump .
And so it was no surprise that the Clinton campaign and its allies seized the moment last week when Trump asserted that the Democratic frontrunner was playing â€œthe woman cardâ€ � and only stood where she was on the basis of her gender .
Clinton responded by stating that if defending reproductive rights and calling for equal pay amounted to playing the gender card , â€œthen deal me inâ€ � .
Her campaign also raised $ 2.4 m in three days off a â€œWoman Cardâ€ � drive launched in the wake of Trumpâ€ ™ s comments , 40 % of which came from first - time donors .
Aides to Clinton said the campaign would continue to call outoffensive rhetoric â€ “ Clinton has attacked Trump from the stump over his statements against immigrants and Muslims , and on Thursday in Los Angeles denounced his reaffirmation of plans for mass deportations .
The campaign also put out a bilingual video , in English and Spanish , featuring clips of Trump bolstering his anti - immigration platform .
A Clinton aide nonetheless maintained that the former secretary of state would stick predominantly to running a campaign rooted in the issues confronting the American public .
The substantive contrast , from jobs and the economy to national security , would give Clinton the opportunity not simply to rally core Democratic constituencies but also to reach out to those Republicans reluctant to embrace him as their standard - bearer .
â€œThe same message is true for Republicans as it is for Democrats .
He is too big a risk , â€ � the aide said .
â€œHe will not keep us safe , in fact some of his dangerous comments make us less safe.â€ �
â€œThese are messages that we donâ€ ™ t think are just Democratic messages .
We may not agree on every issue , but fundamentally people want a president who can bring people together.â€ �
Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign , although still fending off an unlikely challenge from Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , began to switch gears toward the general election in the last couple of weeks â€ “ both in tone and restructuring on the ground .
The campaign accelerated its operation in swing states , with moves that included the hiring of state directors in Florida , Colorado and New Hampshire , and closer coordination with state parties .
Trump , by contrast , lags far behind in building a credible general election campaign .
Throughout the primaries , he was able to benefit from months of wall - to - wall free coverage of his campaign rallies on rolling TV news channels , so Trump is only now adding to his team a group of seasoned operatives with the knowhow to establish a formidable ground operation .
And while the presidential race is still expected to be waged across the familiar battlegrounds , some early projections show the potential to flip certain states on the electoral map into the Democratsâ€ ™ column .
Among them are Arizona and Georgia , both of which are home to burgeoning minority populations .
The impact of Trumpâ€ ™ s nomination is also expected to reverberate across Senate and House races .
The Republican - led US Senate is defending several seats in competitive states , where Democrats have been eager to tie vulnerable incumbents to Trump .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to hold Donald Trump accountable every single day between now and 8 November , but also Republicans down the ticket who can no longer make up excuses and have to say whether or not they stand with their partyâ€ ™ s standard - bearer , â€ � said a top Democratic aide .
Senator John McCain , the 2008 Republican presidential nominee , was caught on tape this week acknowledging in a private fundraiser the havoc Trump might wreak for his re - election bid in Arizona .
â€œIf Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket , here in Arizona , with over 30 % of the vote being the Hispanic vote , no doubt that this may be the race of my life , â€ � McCain said , according to audio obtained by Politico .
Of the 34 seats up for grabs in November , 24 are being defended by Republicans .
Several are states won easily by Barack Obama in 2012 , as well as those where Trump fares poorly in the polls .
And in many of them , Democrats have female candidates on the ballot who could be the beneficiaries of Trumpâ€ ™ s record low approval ratings among women .

List has used Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œwoman cardâ€ � comments to target Republicans in states that include Ohio , Colorado , Illinois and Maine , who are running in Senate races against women candidates .
Thatâ€ ™ s not to say Democrats are underestimating Trump and his potential , whether at the presidential or statewide level .
Barasky , of Priorities USA , said at least one lesson gleaned from the primary season was that Republicans failed to grasp just how much of a threat Trump posed .
â€œWe are taking Trump very , very seriously ,
â€ � he said .
â€œWe believe that Trump can win and weâ€ ™ re going to do everything we can to make sure that doesnâ€ ™ t happen.â€ �"
2016-05-06,"In the days leading up to the Indiana primary , Ted Cruz announced that America faced â€œa time for choosingâ€ � .
He didnâ€
™ t say it just to pretentiously quote Ronald Reagan in his failed attempt to catapult Barry Goldwater to the presidency ( though it did have that added benefit ) .
Rather , Cruz did it to frame the debate : Americans could either back him , a principled if widely reviled conservative insider , or they could back Donald Trump and â€œplunge into the abyssâ€ � .
The Republican electorate chose Trump .
And now that he is the presumed candidate for president , it is the party establishment that must make a choice :
To Donald or not to Donald ?
The trouble for them all is that to hate Donald Trump has become synonymous with hating their own electorate .
Itâ€ ™ s no longer a question of supporting Donald Trump : itâ€
™ s a question of supporting the people theyâ€ ™ re presumed to represent .
The beauty and the horror of Trump is that he tells people what he thinks they want to hear , and his genius is knowing precisely what that is .
Heâ€
™ s done a better job of reading the GOP base than anyone in the party and , ever the salesman , heâ€ ™ s selling himself in the image of his electorateâ€ ™ s values .
Trumpâ€ ™ s populist message on the economy , trade deals and national security ( he was against the Iraq war and appears to be largely non - interventionist ) coupled with a generous dose of racism , sexism and xenophobia is the most accurate portrait we have of what Republican voters actually think , feel and want to see represented .
And many in the Republican leadership , perhaps sensing that this is a losing general election strategy , are by turns discouraged and embarrassed .
This was true at least as far back as 2008 , when Republican leaders like John Boehner and John McCain envisioned a party that was relatively moderate , diverse and inclusive â€ “ an effort perhaps best embodied in a memo Boehner sent to his colleagues that election cycle with the subject line , â€œThe future is Caoâ€ � .
But who , you might be asking yourself , is Cao ?
That is precisely the point .
The first Vietnamese American to ever serve in Congress ,
Louisianaâ€ ™ s
Joseph Cao represented an inclusive conservatism .
He sought to embody not just conservative ideals but also the interests of his mostly black constituents .
When he was elected in 2008 , he exemplified the conservative ideals of party leadership , but notably , not of the actual electorate .
Two years years later , Cao was out of Congress , and a new class of Tea Party Republicans rose up .
Even now , eight years later , party elites still havenâ€
™ t learned their lesson .
Take earlier this year , when leadership tapped Nikki Haley , the first Indian American governor of South Carolina , to deliver the party response to Obamaâ€ ™ s State of the Union address .
Haley was cast as the best brand of conservative to bring together a divided nation â€ “ last year
she earned plaudits when she called for the removal of the Confederate flag from her stateâ€ ™ s capitol in the wake of the racially motivated Charleston shooting .
She lent credence to GOPâ€ ™ s notion that its party can appeal to women , minorities and immigrants , criticizing her party for an approach that â€œappears cold and unwelcoming to minoritiesâ€ � .
That particular strain of Republicanism , she added , is â€œshameful and that has to changeâ€ � .
The vision sheâ€ ™ s laid out is in many ways the antidote to Trumpism .
He calls for a ban on all Muslims ; she invokes her familyâ€ ™ s immigrant history in explaining the need for tolerance .
This was the Republicanism party elites wanted .
This was a party that could be competitive in an increasingly diverse society â€ “ a party embodied by the candidacy of Marco Rubio .
This was a party that could win a general election .
But itâ€ ™ s not representative of their voting base .
Trump is .
And what he represents â€ “ the very thing Nikki Haley called â€œshamefulâ€ �
â€ “ is .
Sure , heâ€ ™ s not espousing traditional conservative values in condemning free trade and American interventionism , but neither does his base any more .
The party has changed in ways elites have failed to grasp up there in their marble - floored buildings , though they are slowly grasping it now .
Itâ€ ™ s why many within the establishment like the RNCâ€ ™ s Reince Priebus are calling for unity around Trump .
And why others are backing away from what , as Red State writer Ben Howe put it in a tweet last month , might best be described as , â€œThat awful moment when you realize your party actually does have an overabundance of racists.â€
�
Everyone in leadership can make their own choice , but the tea leaves are clear .
The trouble now for Cruz and for so many other Republican leaders facing the question of whether to back Trump , is that itâ€ ™ s not just Trump theyâ€ ™ re choosing ; it never was , really .
Theyâ€ ™ re choosing whether theyâ€ ™ ll finally relinquish conservatism as they know it , and as it no longer really exists .
In uniting around Trump , something the party leadership looks poised to do , they will also be doing something much darker .
As # NeverTrump morphs into # EventuallyTrump , the heart of the conservative movement will die , and it will be replaced by a new party entirely .
Itâ€ ™ s
one thatâ€ ™ s appealingly populist , sure .
But also racist , sexist , xenophobic â€ “ at times violent â€ “ and consistently mad as hell at a political class that looks down on them while taking their votes for granted ."
2016-05-07,"Watching Barack Obama and former House Speaker John Boehner swap stories and advice earlier this month for the next chapters in their lives , I was inspired to offer my own bipartisan overture to fellow Texan Ted Cruz as he ends his campaign for the presidency , returning to the slow retired country club of mostly old white men we call the US Senate .
After all , I feel his pain â€ “ losing a big race that was closely watched around the country .
I wonâ€ ™ t go so far as to say that Ted and I have parallel paths .
But we are both Texans ; we both stood up for values that matter to us using lengthy filibusters ( mine to make sure women received healthcare ; his to make sure millions didnâ€ ™ t ) ; we both took to the campaign trail and fought with vigor for the opportunity to serve .
And we both lost to guys who ran on an anti - immigrant platform .
While there are plenty of differences ( too many for a single column ) , I am more than happy to share a few nuggets of wisdom I learned post - election with the Gentleman from Texas to help him readjust to life off - the - trail .
Consider a hobby , but choose carefully Not cards .
Maybe youâ€ ™ ll be invited to play cards with some of the boys .
But I would caution you that now is not the right time .
Donald Trump â€œplayed the woman cardâ€ � before you , and it isnâ€ ™ t turning out so well for him .
And heâ€ ™ s already doing better than you are .
Not travel ( at least not to New York City ) .
You may be tempted to get away with Heidi and the kids to see a Broadway show ( I hear Hamilton is amazing ) .
But given that â€œNew York valuesâ€ � comment you made , you may not be welcome there .
Not reading the same old thing .
You can really only read Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor once before it becomes clichÃ © .
Iâ€ ™ ve got a well - worn copy of The Feminine Mystique I can lend you .
Maybe Twitter ?
I know it helped to propel Mr Trump to his ultimate victory in the Republican primary .
Rest assured â€ “ youâ€ ™ ll find kindred spirits online ( we call yours â€œtrollsâ€ � , but that is neither here nor there ) .
In fact , Iâ€ ™ ve made incredible friends on Twitter ; @FullFrontalSamB and I were talking about you there just the other day actually !
And Iâ€ ™ ve had insightful and amusing conversations with amazing change - makers like Ellen Page , Kerry Washington , Cecile Richards and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand .
I am sure that @AnnCoulter canâ€ ™ t wait to dive deep into a high - minded and compelling Twitter discourse with you .
Enjoy time with your friends Following my loss , I found solace and comfort with my daughters and friends .
I know Heidi and the kids
canâ€

Donâ€ ™ t fret
â€ “ Heidi will get over that elbow to her face after your campaign suspension speech the other night .
Plus , now you can call up Carly â€ “ unless her friendship only lasts as long as her tenure as VP candidate , in which case you may be getting sent to her voicemail about as fast as youâ€ ™ ll be sent to Paul Ryanâ€ ™ s .
Speaking of which , Iâ€ ™ m sure your Senate colleagues will be thrilled to see you .
Lindsay Graham said as much : â€œIf you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate , and the trial was in the Senate , nobody would convict you.â€

Oh , wait .
Surely he just meant , â€œIf Ted Cruz killed it on the floor of the Senateâ€ ¦ â€

Get back to work Your work friends are the perfect segue into my last bit of advice : embrace your job and work hard upon your return .
I am sure that , like me , you embrace the calling to public service .
While I had to resign from the Texas State Senate to run for governor , you didnâ€ ™ t have to leave the US Senate to run for president .
Thatâ€ ™ s great !
It means you can jump right back into the critical work of legislating .
With all the work that the Senate is doing right now â€ “ meeting with appointees to the US supreme court and holding hearings to confirm a new Secretary of the Army , passing budgets â€ “ wait , none of that is getting done .
Well , you will fit right back in nonetheless given your penchant for shutting down the government when you donâ€ ™ t get your way .
Perhaps 2017 will be better ; think of how busy youâ€ ™ ll be battling all those gender equity initiatives that Hillary Clinton will launch as president , advancing the revolutionary ideas of equal pay , reproductive autonomy and family leave policies !
As for me , Iâ€ ™ ve been hard at work since my own run to build Deeds
Not Words , a community of millennial women passionate about creating positive change ( hopefully one of them will one day maneuver to take your job ) .
In the meantime , though , think how fortunate youâ€ ™ ll be to tell your grandchildren one day that you had the honor of serving under your nationâ€ ™ s first woman president ."
2016-05-10,"Ted Cruz refused to commit his support to Donald Trump as the Republican nominee on Tuesday , and did not rule out resurrecting his campaign for president despite having dropped out of the race last week .
In an interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck , the Texas senator said that picking a presidential candidate â€œis not a choice that we as voters have to make todayâ€ � .
His comments came as Marco Rubio , the Florida senator who suspended his own presidential bid in March , said he would support Trump as the nominee .
During an interview with CNN on Tuesday , Rubio said he intended to stick to a pledge signed by all of the Republican candidates last year to back the eventual nominee .
â€œI signed a pledge , put my name on it , and said I would support the Republican nominee and thatâ€ ™ s what I intend to do , â€ � Rubio said .
Cruz appeared less bound by the pledge , which has already been discarded by former contenders Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham â€ “ both of whom have come out against Trump despite his all but clinching the Republican nomination .
Cruz pointed out there were still two months until the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and six months until the general election , saying â€œwe need to watch and see what the candidates say and doâ€ � .
Although Cruz had long committed to supporting the Republican nominee in the past , his tone changed after Trump repeatedly made personal attacks against Cruz and his family .
The businessman branded his rival â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � , threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on his wife while implying she was unattractive , and accused Cruzâ€ ™ s father of involvement in the assassination of John F Kennedy .
While Cruz once called Trump â€œa friendâ€ � and â€œterrificâ€ � , he held an abrupt press conference hours before ending his campaign at which he derided Trump as a â€œserial philandererâ€ � , an â€œamoral pathological liarâ€ � , and a â€œbraggadocious , arrogant buffoonâ€ � .
Nor would Cruz rule out returning to the campaign trail if â€œthereâ€ ™ s a path to victoryâ€ � .
The Texas senator suspended his campaign after losing the Indiana primary on 3 May by a margin of 53%-37 % , and said that with the loss he no longer saw a path to the Republican nomination .
On Tuesday , Cruz told Beck : â€œIf that changes , we will certainly respond accordingly.â€ �
However , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign had a well - organized effort to put his supporters into positions of power among Republican delegates , who will elect the partyâ€ ™ s nominee at the national convention in Cleveland this July .
This effort means that although Trump is the only candidate left in the Republican primary , Cruz supporters will have significant influence on the convention floor , and that his delegates will probably hold control of crucial committees , such as those that write the convention rules and design the partyâ€ ™ s platform .
Cruz made clear that a return to the trail was very unlikely , though he would not rule it out .
â€œIâ€
™ m not holding my breath , â€ � he said , in response to questioning about a primary election in Nebraska , also on Tuesday , that he was once expected to win .
The Texas senator did dismiss the possibility of running as a third - party candidate or supporting a third - party alternative in November .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s very likely , â€ � he told Beck .
â€œItâ€
™ s always talked about ; I donâ€
™ t think itâ€ ™ s something thatâ€ ™ s likely to happen.â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s statements followed Trumpâ€ ™ s continued failure to unite the Republican party behind him .
Two former presidents have said they will not back him and key party figures like the speaker of the House , Paul Ryan , have declined to endorse him , at least for the present .
The former reality television star is scheduled to meet Republican congressional leaders in Washington on Thursday , as part of his effort to heal the rifts within the party .
Rubio said while he stood by his prior criticisms of Trump â€ “ which included dubbing his former opponent â€œan erratic con artistâ€ � â€ “ Republican primary voters had made their choice clear .
â€œMy differences with Donald â€ “ both my reservations about his campaign and my policy differences with him
â€ “ are well documented and they remain , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut Iâ€ ™ m not going to sit here right now and become his chief critic over the next six months , because he deserves the opportunity to go forward and make his argument and try to win.â€
�
He added : â€œI know what I said during the campaign ; I enunciated those things repeatedly .
And voters chose a different direction .
I stand by the things that I said.â€ �
Rubio nonetheless declined to offer Trump an explicit endorsement , hedging when asked if he planned to vote for the billionaire in November .
â€œI intend to support the nominee , â€ � Rubio said .
Pressed again by the CNN host Jake Tapper on whether that meant casting a ballot in Trumpâ€ ™ s favor , Rubio responded : â€œIâ€ ™ m not voting for Hillary Clinton .
Iâ€ ™ m not throwing away my vote.â€

2016-05-10,"Donald Trump has won West Virginiaâ€ ™ s Republican primary over former rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich , who remained on the ballot despite their having dropped out of the race last week .
Trumpâ€ ™
s win â€
“ called by the Associated Press minutes after polls closed â€
“ was expected even before Cruz and Kasich suspended their campaigns following poor showings in Indiana .
With 13 % of precincts reporting , Trump had received 72 % of the vote in West Virginia , with Cruz at 11 % and Kasich at 10 % .
Polls in the Mountain State had given the real estate mogul a lead of over 30 points before his win in last weekâ€ ™ s primary made him the GOPâ€ ™ s likely standard - bearer in the November general election .
His victory came despite his telling supporters not to bother to vote in the primary at a campaign rally in the state capital of Charleston on Thursday .
â€œSave your vote for the general election in November , â€ � the presumptive nominee told a raucous crowd of over 13,000 .
Nevertheless , Trumpâ€ ™ s win in West Virginia may not translate into a clean sweep of the stateâ€ ™ s 34 delegates .
Voters in West Virginia cast ballots for individual delegates .
This means that a Republican voter in the Mountain State has to cast 25 individual votes : three for their district delegates and 22 for statewide delegates .
Although each delegateâ€ ™ s presidential preference is listed on the ballot , the stateâ€ ™ s convoluted rules add an additional wrinkle that complicates the process .
Among the 22 statewide delegates , no more than two can be elected from an individual county and seven from a congressional district .
These jurisdictions are not listed on the ballot .
This means that the third highest vote - getter from a county or the eighth from a congressional district is automatically disqualified from serving as a delegate .
Although the Trump campaign tried to distribute an official slate to avoid wasted votes , there is still significant potential for Trump supporters to cluster their votes as nine of the first 22 Trump delegates are from a single county .
This creates scenarios where outnumbered but better - organized Cruz supporters can still elect delegates and have a foothold in the stateâ€ ™ s delegation at the convention .
In the Democratic race in West Virginia , Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton .
In Nebraska , the other Republican state holding a contest on Tuesday , Trump also beat Cruz and Kasich .
Prior to dropping out , Cruz had long been favored in the winner - take - all Cornhusker State and had a series of major endorsements scheduled to be released there the day after Indianaâ€ ™ s primary .
Further , the stateâ€ ™ s freshman senator , Ben Sasse , has been perhaps the most vocal opponent of Trump of any Republican elected official .
But the departure of Cruz and Kasich from the race meant Trump won the contest and all 36 delegates on offer there .
The Associated Press called the race moments after polls closed .
In his single campaign event in Nebraska on Friday , Trump was endorsed by the stateâ€ ™ s governor , Pete Ricketts , whose family had previously donated millions to Our Principles Pac , the leading anti - Trump Super Pac ."
2016-05-13,"The relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News over the past nine months has been fascinating .
After a rocky start , the two appear to be very friendly indeed .
In the latest development , Rupert Murdochâ€ ™ s â€œfair and balancedâ€ � TV channel has been accused by Trumpâ€ ™ s Republican rival , Ted Cruz , of playing a disproportionate role in his rise .
Ahead of this
weekâ€
™ s
Indiana primary , in which Trump beat Cruz by a 180,000 margin and secured more than 50 % of the total vote
, Cruz was critical of Murdoch and Fox News chairman Roger Ailes .
They had made a decision to get behind Trump , he said , and in so doing â€œhave turned Fox News into the Donald Trump network , 24/7.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s possible that Foxâ€ ™ s championing of Trump goes back to August last year following the notorious clash between Trump and the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly who questioned him about his misogyny .
Trump retaliated by criticising Kellyâ€ ™ s appearance and her credibility as a journalist .
He even suggested menstruation as a reason for her questions .
Trump went on to boycott another Fox News debate in January because it was co - moderated by Kelly .
He claimed she was biased against him , saying : â€œIâ€ ™ m not a big fan of hers.â€
�
Some 87 % of Fox viewers then said they would not watch the debate because Trump wasnâ€ ™ t taking part .
Result : panic at Fox News due to the potential loss of advertising .
After the original Kelly row , Ailes realised fences must be mended .
As New York magazine reported , Trump was called by Ailes to assure him that the channel would cover him â€œfairlyâ€ � in future .
Why ?
Because of concern - supported by a deluge of pro - Trump emails to Fox - that Trumpâ€ ™
s views were more popular than those of Fox News .
Matt Taibbi , writing in Rolling Stone , argued that Murdoch was worried about the drifting away of his â€œbeloved audience of idiotsâ€ � .
And Murdoch loves a winner , so it was necessary to get behind Trump .
It was clear that emailers had taken Trumpâ€ ™ s side rather than Kellyâ€ ™ s .
And it appears that some Fox presenters did too .
Kelly has been critical of her Fox colleague , Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly , for failing to support her in what can only described as a softball interview .
Then things took a turn last month when Kelly told her viewers that she had cleared the air with Trump after asking to meet him .
She said of the truce : â€œMr .
Trump and I discussed the possibility of an interview , and I hope we will have news to announce on that soon.â€ � Ailes later confirmed he had spoken to Trump â€œa few times over the past three monthsâ€ � about appearing on a special programme with Kelly .
It was later announced that Trump would be a guest on Kellyâ€ ™ s show on 17 May , and publicity pictures of the pre - recorded show , which was taped on 26 April , have been issued .
After the interview , Trump said he expected people to enjoy it , saying of Kelly : â€œShe has natural showbiz ability with unlimited potential.â€ �
It is hard not to conclude that Kelly had been prevailed upon by her Fox bosses to make nice with a man who had continually been insulting her for nine months in public statements and on Twitter .
And it gives credence to Cruzâ€ ™ s â€œDonald Trump
networkâ€
� jibe .
Has Donald Trump done what no politician has ever achieved in the past by making Rupert Murdoch dance to his tune ?"
2016-05-14,"Ted Cruz dared not speak the name of the man who defeated him for the Republican nomination for president on Saturday , avoiding mention of the candidate he once called both â€œterrificâ€ � and a â€œbuffoonâ€ � and instead telling Texans he would fight on in the vanguard of a far - right conservative movement .
The only Republican who had a chance at preventing Donald Trump from securing the nomination , Cruz did not use the presumptive nomineeâ€
™ s
name once in his keynote speech to Texas Republicans at their state convention .
But he did allude to the deep unease , and in some quarters overwhelming repulsion , that many Republicans feel about having the former reality TV star represent their party .
â€œSome are asking , â€˜What now?â€ ™ â€ � the Texas senator said .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know what the future will hold , but I want to encourage each of you to have hope.â€ �
He added : â€œFor those who are discouraged , let me simply say this : truth will prevail.â€ �
Cruz defeated Trump in Texas , amassed nearly 550 delegates that will go to the partyâ€ ™ s national convention in July , and for a time seemed likely to at least prevent Trump from clinching the nomination before the national convention .
In the early months of the primary , he praised Trump and let other candidates wither under the businessmanâ€ ™ s personal attacks .
But Cruz was overwhelmed in north - eastern states where his ultraconservative views earned scorn , and Trump eventually branded him â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � for his campaignâ€ ™ s false claims about another candidate and its backroom machinations .
In the final days of Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign , he could hardly find support in states thought to be sympathetic to his message .
He was heckled by a child , mocked to his face by voters , and contended with a baseless tabloid story â€ “ surfaced by Trump â€ “ that associated his father with the assassination of John F Kennedy .
Hours before dropping out of the race , Cruz finally abandoned any pretense of civility and declared Trump an â€œamoral pathological liarâ€ � who threatened to take the US into â€œthe abyssâ€ � .
On Saturday he again hinted at Trump with such language , saying he would lead â€œin this battle to pull America back from the abyssâ€ � .
The senator has so far refused to support Trump , though during the primary he repeatedly said he would support the nominee .
He told the Texas Tribune on Saturday he was â€œwatching and listeningâ€ � , but added : â€œI donâ€ ™ t have anything else to say about Donald Trump.â€ �
During his speech , Cruz also alluded to the way the Republican party has splintered in recent months between hardline conservatives who back Cruz , â€œcorporateâ€ � or â€œestablishmentâ€ � Republicans who dislike the senator and support conventional candidates , and the new base of less ideological voters who have elected Trump .
Those factions face a difficult reconciliation , and Cruz referred to â€œgrowing challengesâ€ � in the weeks ahead .
He spoke of the party in quasi - religious tones , as if it were facing an apocalyptic purge , and returned to his theme when he said his conservative movement â€œwill be the remnant , will be the core of pulling this country back from the abyssâ€ � .
â€œI am convinced with my soul God is not done with America yet , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m gon na devote my time , my energy , to mobilizing we the people , this movement , that believes in commonsense conservative principles.â€
�
Cruz could still have considerable influence at the convention in July , using his delegates to change the rules and pull the party platform to the right .
On Saturday , he only promised to work for conservative principles in the Senate , which he suggested should not do the work of making laws .
â€œThe federal government needs to leave us the heck alone , â€ � he said .
â€œSecure the border , deliver the mail and keep us safe : thatâ€ ™ s it!â€
�
Similarly , Cruz criticized Barack Obama for new public school guidelines that allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identity .
â€œThere is nothing in the constitution that gives the president the power to be the bathroom police in this country , â€ � he said .
Cruz instead supports a state - level law that bars transgender people from using the bathroom they identify with , a law state police have said they do not know how to enforce .
The senator gave a religious rationale for his argument that government has virtually no place in society , saying : â€œOur rights donâ€ ™ t come from government
â€ “
they come from God almighty.â€ �
He promised to renew his fight for â€œreligious freedomâ€ � protections in the Senate , where for years his colleagues have heard his uncompromising , evangelical - inspired views with exasperation .
Earlier this week , he joked at a party lunch : â€œTo be honest with you ,
I didnâ€ ™ t want to come back.â€ �
Senator John McCain , the Republicansâ€ ™ 2008 nominee , had a ready reply : â€œWe didnâ€ ™ t really want you back , either.â€ �"
2016-05-18,"Donald Trump admitted to regrets over his behavior in a highly publicized interview with Foxâ€ ™ s Megyn Kelly on Tuesday , but in characteristic form the presumptive Republican nominee stopped short of apologizing for incidents ranging from mocking former opponent Carly Fiorinaâ€ ™ s face to retweeting someone who called Kelly a â€œbimboâ€ � .
The broadcast came shortly before Trump was declared the winner in Oregon over rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich , who remained on the ballot despite having dropped out of the race earlier this month .
With nearly 20 % of the vote counted , Trump had 64.3 % of the vote , to Ohio governor Kasichâ€
™ s 20.2 % and Texas senator Cruzâ€ ™ s 15.5 % .
Trump and Kelly finally sat down on national television after reaching a truce that brought an end to a feud dating back to the first Republican presidential debate last August .
Their animosity began with Trumpâ€ ™ s assertion following the debate that Kelly , one of its moderators , treated him unfairly , and his now infamous comment implying she had been on her period .
He continued to berate her coverage of his campaign through his Twitter account and even skipped a Republican debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses that Kelly moderated .
But Tuesdayâ€ ™ s much hyped interview contained few challenges on Kellyâ€ ™ s part toward Trump , who used the opportunity to try and portray a softer demeanor and begin to put behind him some of the more controversial moments of his primary campaign .
Seeking to defend the brash and often ugly turns of his campaign , Trump suggested it was simply a means of emerging from the crowded Republican field as a winner .
â€œIf
I were soft , if I were presidential â€ ¦ in a way itâ€ ™ s a bad word , because thereâ€ ™ s nothing wrong with being presidential , but if I had not fought back in the way I fought back , I donâ€ ™ t think I would have been successful , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI respond pretty strongly , but in just about all cases , Iâ€ ™ ve been responding to what they did to me.â€
�
The interview followed an hourlong meeting between Trump and Kelly in April at his eponymous tower in New York , which thawed the friction that for months separated Kelly from her colleagues at Fox News â€ “ where coverage has largely tilted in his favor .
Kelly did , however , confront Trump over his conduct toward her following the August debate in Cleveland , Ohio .
The former reality TV star explained he had never participated in a debate before and in essence grew flustered .
â€œThat was the first question Iâ€ ™ ve ever been asked , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œAnd Iâ€ ™ m saying to myself , â€˜Man
what a question .
And Iâ€ ™ m saying to myself , Iâ€ ™ ve got two hours of
this?â€ ™ â€ �
He also sought to downplay his embrace of the phrase â€œbimboâ€ � to describe Kelly , suggesting at first that he didnâ€ ™ t recall doing so .
When Kelly pointed out Trump had on several occasions retweeted followers insulting her as such , he responded : â€œOoo .
OK .
Did I say that ?
Excuse
me.â€ �
He added : â€œOver your life , Megyn , youâ€ ™ ve been called a lot worse .
Itâ€ ™ s a modern form of fighting back.â€ �
Kelly said that it was not about her but rather about the message sent to young girls , to which Trump only offered that he would no longer go after her â€œbecause
I think I like our relationship
right nowâ€ � .
Trump has slowly looked to rebuild his image while shifting gears toward a general election contest in which he is expected to face Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton .
Although his litany of controversial statements remain part of the public record , Trump had already signaled a shift in tone while discussing his proposal to ban all Muslims from coming to the US â€ “ referring to it as merely a suggestion in an interview last week despite campaigning on the platform for months .
Kelly did not press Trump in great detail on policy , choosing instead to allow him to reveal his personal side by reflecting on prior marriages and what he learned about himself from such experiences .
Trump gave the interview his stamp of approval , tweeting at its conclusion :"
2016-05-25,"Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday , but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque , New Mexico , where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police .
With 73 % of votes counted in Washington , Trump had won 76.2 % of primary voters .
John Kasich and Ted Cruz , both of whom have dropped out of the race , had won 9.9.% and 10.1 % respectively .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination .
Outside Trumpâ€ ™ s rally in Albuquerque , protests against the presumptive nominee turned nasty on Tuesday night , with protesters overturning crowd control barriers and throwing rocks at police .
There were early posts on social media reporting gunshots and tear gas , but the Albuquerque police department said those were inaccurate .
Nonetheless , police horses were deployed to control the large crowd of protesters , and some reports showed pepper spray being used .
The door to the convention center where Trump was speaking was also smashed .
More than an hour after Trump had finished speaking and left for California , where he will campaign for the next few days in the run - up to the stateâ€ ™
s 7 June primary
, hundreds of protesters still thronged the streets , waving Mexican flags , lighting fires and chanting .
Trump is the only remaining candidate campaigning for the Republican nomination , but Kasich and Cruz were also on the ballot in Washington , having suspended their campaigns after the ballots were printed .
Dr Ben Carson was also on the ballot because he reportedly never officially submitted a withdrawal of his candidacy to the state .
The state delegation , which was selected on Saturday at the state convention in preparation for the primary , is composed almost entirely of supporters of Cruz , whose supporters overwhelmed the state convention in Pasco .
Despite this , the delegates are bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot at the national convention , US senate candidate and former chairman of the Washington state Republican party Chris Vance , who was at the convention , told the Guardian .
However , with seven upcoming primaries , including New Jersey and California , Trump is expected to easily overtake the delegate mark needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July , avoiding a contested convention .
In a strange quirk of party politics , the Democrats also held a presidential primary in Washington on Tuesday , but it didnâ€
™ t matter in the slightest because the Democratic delegation from Washington was already settled by a caucus in March , at which Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 73 % to 27 % .
Interestingly , in the Democratic primary â€ “ which was admittedly meaningless as it has no bearing on the number of delegates as opposed to the caucuses â€ “ Clinton won comfortably , 53.63 % to 46.37 % , implying that perhaps Democratic voters want the primary season to be , finally , over with ."
2016-05-26,"Five hardline conservative senators , including former presidential candidate Ted Cruz , have demanded the US justice department stop all investigations into whether oil and gas companies lied to the public and shareholders about climate change .
â€œWe write today to demand that the Department of Justice ( DoJ ) immediately cease its ongoing use of law enforcement resources to stifle private debate on one of the most controversial public issues of our time , â€ � the senators wrote in a letter dated 25 May.
The letter intends to forestall a federal investigation like those begun by states around the US .
In New York last year , the state attorney general , Eric Schneiderman , began an investigation into whether Exxon Mobil lied to its investors about the dangers of climate change , and subpoenaed the oil giant for records .
The justice department did not immediately confirm that it has any such investigations in progress or under consideration .
In March , the US attorney general , Loretta Lynch , said the question was discussed and information â€œreferred it to the FBI to consider whether or not it meets the criteria for what we could take action onâ€
� .
Also on Wednesday , Exxonâ€ ™ s CEO , Rex Tillerson , defied shareholders and activists who have called on the company to acknowledge climate change and change its behaviors .
â€œUntil we have [ breakthroughs in green technology ] , just saying â€˜turn the taps offâ€ ™ is not acceptable to humanity , â€ � he said .
â€œThe world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels , whether they like it or not.â€ �
Some investors have tried to force change within the company , and the Rockefeller family , descended from Standard Oil tycoon John D Rockefeller , divested fully from Exxon earlier this year .
Exxon funded efforts that cast doubt on climate science for years , research shows , and tried to censor a series of lectures to Congress in 2001 , according to former officials of the US Global Change Research Program .
But the companyâ€ ™ s own scientists warned of climate change and records from the 1960s suggest the environment was on the oil companyâ€ ™ s agenda : it was interested in patents to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in cars .
The company was not mentioned by name in the senatorsâ€ ™ letter .
Parallel investigations have either been announced or reported in more than a dozen other states , including California , Connecticut , Massachusetts and Virginia .
The senatorsâ€ ™ letter took note of these investigations , and called them â€œdisturbing confirmation that government officials are threatening to wield the sword of law enforcement to silence debate on climate changeâ€ � .
The investigations amount to an assault on free speech , the senators argued .
â€œInitiating criminal prosecution for a private entityâ€ ™ s opinions on climate change is a blatant violation of the first amendment , â€ � they wrote , â€œand an abuse of power that rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.â€
�
At a March press conference , Schneiderman acknowledged this argument , but said that certain actions â€ “ for instance covering up information from shareholders â€ “ were not protected free speech .
â€œThe first amendment , ladies and gentlemen , â€ �
he said , â€œdoes not give you the right to commit fraud.â€ �
The senators asked for a response within two weeks to confirm that the department ends all investigations â€œarising from any private individual or entityâ€ ™ s views on climate changeâ€ � , and assurance that no one will be persecuted â€œsimply for disagreeing with the prevailing climate change orthodoxyâ€ � .
The senators voiced their opposition to the overwhelming evidence of climate change only two weeks after April was confirmed as the hottest on record , and only a month after researchers found alarming signs in cloud analysis and ice levels that suggest the effects of warming are happening faster than predicted .
Forty - one percent of Americans , a record high , now believe that global warming will be a â€œserious
threatâ€ � in their lifetime , polling shows .
Some of the senators have embraced this â€œoutsiderâ€ � position .
Jeff Sessions enthusiastically endorsed Donald Trump for president , Mike Lee has called for the Senate to defund the Paris climate agreement , and David Vitter has called the evidence â€œoutlandishâ€ � , although his state of Louisiana includes an island that has lost 98 % of its land .
Cruz has proven a staunch opponent of anyone who warns about global warming , and has called a jazz vocalist to testify opposite a meteorologist and former navy admiral .
The oil and gas industry gave more to the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign than to any other candidateâ€ ™ s in the Republican primary election .
The letter is one of Cruzâ€ ™ s first prominent actions since his reluctant return to the Senate ."
2016-05-26,"A top Trump staffer was abruptly let go on Wednesday under mysterious circumstances , after a dispute with the campaignâ€ ™ s Florida director .
Rick Wiley was the presumptive nomineeâ€ ™ s national political director and a close ally of Paul Manafort , a veteran political operative who has been in the middle of an ongoing and well - publicized power struggle with the campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski .
Manafort , who was recently promoted to be the campaignâ€ ™ s chief strategist , was brought on by Trump in March after Ted Cruz ran up a number of victories in the delegate selection process .
Wiley , unlike many others on the campaign , had a well - established pedigree in Republican politics .
The former campaign manager for Wisconsin governor Scott Walkerâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , Wiley was a former political director for the RNC and had longstanding ties with many party leaders .
Wileyâ€ ™ s departure came amid a disagreement with Karen Giorno , the campaignâ€ ™ s Florida director .
The clash , first reported by Politico , led to Giorno being given sole responsibility for the Sunshine State .
As one campaign source told the Guardian : â€œKaren is rightfully held in high regard [ on the campaign ] .
She won Florida for us.â€
�
The source noted that Giorno was not only well - connected and well - respected in the state but that she was â€œclearly dedicated to Trumpâ€ � as well .
In a statement , Trump said â€œRick Wiley was hired on a short - term basis as a consultant until the campaign was running full steam .
It is now doing better than ever , we are leading in the polls , and we have many exciting events ready to go , far ahead of schedule , while Hillary continues her long , boring quest against Bernie .
We would like to thank Rick for helping us during this transition period.â€ �
The description of Wiley being on a short - term contract as a consultant didnâ€ ™ t jibe with the campaignâ€ ™ s announcement of his hiring less than six weeks ago .
At the time , the campaign said Wiley would handle the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s â€œstatewide field operationsâ€ � and Trump touted him as â€œa seasoned political expert with a very successful career in winning elections .
He brings decades of experience , and his deep ties to political leaders and activists across the country will be a tremendous asset as we enter the final phase of securing the nomination.â€ �
A campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for clarification as to whether Wiley had been fired and , if he was on contract , when his contract would have expired ."
2016-07-11,"Move over , Ted Cruz :
House speaker Paul Ryan will lend his star power to Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s national convention , with a primetime speaking slot lined up for Tuesday night , Politico reported .
The speech will be 10 minutes long and will focus on the House Republican agenda .
The Trump campaign has said Iowa senator Joni Ernst will also have a prime - time speaking slot next week .
Bernie Sanders has cleared the way for an endorsement of Hillary Clinton tomorrow , and declared a successful end to his campaign to pull their party to the left during weekend negotiations over the Democratic policy platform .
â€œWe have made enormous strides , â€ � said Sanders in a statement issued after a meeting in Orlando that swung the party in his direction on the minimum wage , climate change and marijuana though failed to make headway on fracking and trade .
â€œThanks to the millions of people across the country who got involved in the political process
â€ “ many for the first time â€ “
we now have the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic party ,
â€ � he said .
As he mulls a running mate , Donald Trump is leaning toward someone with political as opposed to military experience and he expects to make his mind up in the â€œnext three to four days , â€ � he told the Washington Post .
While Trump was careful not to eliminate [ retired Lt Gov Michael Flynn , it was clear that he believed picking someone â€œpoliticalâ€
� was the right move , meaning , presumably , that former Speaker Newt Gingrich , Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and one other political person are in his final four .
President Barack Obama called the assassination of five police officers in Dallas late last week as a â€œhate crimeâ€ � against law enforcement , Politico reports .
â€œOne really striking thing the president said in his opening remarks was that the shooting in Dallas in many ways was strikingly parallel to the Dylann Roof shooting in Charleston in the sense that it was a hate crime , â€ �
Jim Pasco , executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police , told the outlet .
The comment â€œis quite a precedent from our standpoint
, â€ � said Pasco , who has been critical of the presidentâ€ ™ s relationship with law enforcement in the past .
â€œAt the end of the meeting
I asked him to reiterate that publicly , â€ � Pasco said .

In the ongoing political battle over LGBT rights , social conservatives bent but didnâ€ ™ t break as the Republican party drafted its 2016 platform .
With the campaign of presumptive nominee Donald Trump relatively unengaged in the platform process , Republican activists from across the country spent most of today hashing out their differences on gay marriage and other thorny social issues ranging from transgender bathroom access to Internet pornography .
In a cavernous downtown convention center , Republicans spent 12 hours first of their two - day marathon to determine the partyâ€ ™ s policy manifesto for the coming election in small subcommittees and before a televised assembly of full committee of 112 .
The meetings were at times contentious but rarely adversarial .
Instead of harsh rhetoric , rebukes were most often given with rolled eyes and an occasional sigh .
The proposed language in the platform , which called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Courtâ€ ™ s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that overturned all state bans on same - sex marriage , represented a notable shift from past years .
In 2012 , the platform called for a constitutional amendment to legally define marriage as â€œthe union of one man and one woman.â€ � Tony Perkins , a delegate from Louisiana and head of the Family Research Council , pushed back at the idea that the change in language represented a change in Republican policy .
â€œThe idea that the RNC is walking away from this is not correct , simply addressing the present realities of where the issue stands.â€ �
Perkins instead saw it as a Fabian retreat :
â€œYou donâ€ ™ t have the votes in the senate to pass marriage amendment defining marriage for the entire country . . .
you have three quarters of states defining marriage and states are still ticked that 50 million votes were thrown out by five unelected judges.â€ �
However , even that slightly softened language met a vocal effort from delegates seeking to strip any support for a constitutional amendment from same sex marriage from the platform and instead replace it with neutral language that â€œWe encourage and welcome a thoughtful conversation among Republicans about meaning and importance of marriage.â€ �
Despite an emotional plea from Rachel Hoff , the first openly gay member of the RNC platform committee , the amendment appeared to receive the support of only about 20 of the committeeâ€ ™ s 112 members and falling short of the 28-vote threshold needed to potentially trigger minority report and a vote on the floor of the full convention next week .
Republican advocates for LGBT rights also tried unsuccessfully to modify language that called for children to be raised by a married mother and father to read stable loving home .
This was thwarted .
However , an amendment offered by Perkins to allow for conversion therapy slipped through subcommittee without opposition .
Republicans also softened proposed language on transgender access to bathrooms .
Although the subcommittee on family issues added a provision stating â€œwe support and encourage the common sense practice of protecting public safety and personal safety by limiting access to restrooms , locker rooms and other similar facilities , â€ � it was later removed in a full committee hearing .
In a motion offered by the subcommitteeâ€ ™ s co - chair Patricia Longo of Connecticut , the language was described as duplicative and scrubbed without debate .
However , although the platform offered language saying that Obamaâ€ ™ s executive order on the subject â€œillegal , ominous and ignores privacy issues.â€ �
It added â€œwe salute the several states that have filed suit against it.â€
�
This didnâ€ ™ t address the concerns in the subcommittee that introduced the amendment , which Melody Potter of West Virginia emphasized was a safety issue and argued â€œwe have to take a stand.â€ �
Instead , it represented a shift away from supporting affirmative legislation on the subject like North Carolinaâ€ ™ s HB2 and instead opposition to the Obama executive order on the subject as overreach .
The platform also contained a provision calling Internet pornography â€œa public health crisis.â€ �
Mary Frances Forester , who introduced the amendment , told the Guardian â€œwe know how big of a problem it is .
It is an insidious epidemic and everyone knows that and that is not a controversy.â€ �
She hesitated though to predict whether a Trump administration would follow through on the pledge to crackdown on pornography .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think there are many of us that want to predict exactly how its going to come about , â€ � said Forrester .
â€œI think we all have open minds , we all are willing to be impressed but not sure if Iâ€ ™ m ready to give you a definite answer.â€ � Delegates also pushed back against efforts towards medical marijuana and drug decriminalization .
An proposed amendment to encourage states to legalize cannabis oil for medical reasons was rejected as one delegate , Noel Irvin Hentschel , linked marijuana use to mass killings .
â€œAll the mass killings that are taking place
, they are young boys from divorced families and they are smoking marijuana.â€ �
Other opponents linked marijuana use to the heroin epidemic .
The platform committee will finish its work on the GOPâ€ ™ s proposed platform on Tuesday as it deals with potentially contentious proposals about trade and immigration .
Donald Trump is reportedly eyeing former House speaker Newt Gingrich for several potential roles in his hypothetical administration , Bloomberg reports , including a role as a top national security adviser .
Although Gingrich has been talked about as a potential running mate , Bloomberg cited multiple campaign sources as saying that Gingrich was being considered for an unnamed national security role .
At a Trump campaign event in Cincinnati last week , Trump indicated that heâ€ ™ d be more than happy to have Gingrich join him in the White House in some capacity .
â€œNewt has been my friend for a long time , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œAnd Iâ€ ™ m not saying anything , and Iâ€ ™ m not telling even Newt anything , but I can tell you , in one form or another , Newt Gingrich is going to be involved with our government - that I can tell you.â€ � Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has stepped up his aggressive campaign against likely general election opponent Hillary Clinton , but when the former secretary of state was waging her own campaign against then - senator Barack Obama , Trump told a national radio audience that she would â€œmake a good president.â€ � â€œWith the Democratic presidential nomination far from decided , the candidates were jockeying a little bit recently talking about a dream ticket , â€ �
Trump said in March 2008 on his short - lived syndicated radio featurette Trumped ! , the audio of which was unearthed by the Wall Street Journal .
â€œWell , I know her , â€ �
Trump said of Clinton , â€œand sheâ€ ™ d make a good president or a good vice president.â€ �
Trump donated to Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign in 2008 , although he has since disavowed his support as purely oriented towards facilitating favorable conditions for his businesses .
In addition to lauding Clinton , numerous other featurettes from Trumped ! - each segment of which ran roughly sixty seconds long and aired between 2004 and 2008 - discovered by the Wall Street Journal reveal problematic statements made about Saudi Arabia , guns in school classrooms and his own libido .
â€œMen in Saudi Arabia have the authority to divorce their wives without going to the courts .
I guess that would also mean they donâ€ ™ t need prenuptial agreements , â€ �
Trump observed in 2008 , discussing a story from Saudi Arabia in which a Saudi man filed to divorce his wife because she watched a male news anchor on television .
â€œNo courts , no judges - Saudi Arabia sounds like a very good place to get a divorce.â€ �
In another segment from the same year , Trump declared that he was opposed to a proposal in West Virginia that would have allowed hunting - education classes in public schools .
Calling the classes a â€œdangerous risk , â€ �
Trump said that â€œWe hear way too many stories about school violence , so the thought of voluntarily putting guns in the classroom seems like a really bad plan.â€ �
Trump has moved rightward on gun - control issues since running for president , suggesting at one point that a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando could have been avoided if the patrons had been armed .
Trump , who once referenced the size of his genitals during a televised presidential debate , said on a segment in 2006 that reports that women disapproved of one - night stands â€œfooled me.â€ � Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sat down with the Golf Channel for an wide - ranging interview , and in a sneak preview obtained by Mediaite , host David Feherty questions Trump on whether he plans on using a teleprompter during his crowning address at the conventionâ€ ™ s close .
â€œEverybody loves it in the stadium , but in terms of television , it probably doesnâ€ ™ t look as presidential , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a time for both
- I think thereâ€ ™ s a time for both.â€
�
â€œThe big question is , with the RNC coming up , am I going to use a teleprompter or not ?
I donâ€
™ t know if itâ€ ™ s ever been down without , essentially , a teleprompter , â€ � Trump continued .
He said that heâ€ ™ d â€œloveâ€ � to give the address without one , but will likely make the decision roughly a week before the address itself .
The full interview will air on Monday , July 18th , at 9 pm EDT .

: Dozens of protesters staged a sit - in at Florida senator Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s Orlando office on Monday , demanding action on stricter gun laws and policies to protect LGBT individuals .
The demonstration comes nearly one month after a gay nightclub in the city was the target of the deadliest mass shooting in US history , with 49 people killed and 53 more injured .
The organizers said the sit - in would continue for 49 hours , one for each of the slain victims in the 12 June massacre .
It was after the Pulse nightclub shooting that Rubio , whose presidential campaign ended in March , first signaled he might reconsider his decision not to seek re - election to the Senate .
The senator , who formally entered the race last month , has since drawn criticism from proponents of gun safety reforms and LGBT rights for his record on both issues .
Rubio remains opposed to marriage equality and has voted against measures in the past that would protect LGBT individuals from workplace discrimination .
The senator is also a staunch supporter of the second amendment and last week celebrated an endorsement from the National Rifle Association toward his re - election campaign .
Rubio has routinely argued that new gun laws would do little to prevent Americaâ€ ™ s gun violence epidemic and voted against bills to expand background checks and bar those on the FBIâ€ ™ s terror watch list from purchasing firearms .
The Orlando gunman , Omar Mateen , was not actively on a watch list but deemed self - radicalized by authorities and investigated by the FBI several years prior .
In the wake of the Orlando attack , Rubio voted for Republican - backed alternatives to delay firearm sales to those on the terror watch list and require the Justice Department to prove within 72 hours that there was probable cause to ban the purchase all together .
â€œSenator Rubio respects the views of others on these difficult issues , and he welcomes the continued input he is receiving from people across the political spectrum , â€ �
Alex Burgos , a spokesman for his Senate office , said in a statement on the protest .
â€œSenator Rubio and our office continue working around the clock on federal casework to assist victimsâ€ ™ families , survivors and their families , and we stand ready to continue assisting , including lending staff to the victim assistance center as we did for the last few weeks.â€ � â€œOver the past month , Senator Rubio has supported common sense compromises to make it easier to track individuals who have been on the terror watch list and later try to buy firearms , all while improving due process protections for law abiding Americans , â€ � he added .
Protestors argued that Rubioâ€ ™ s steps were insufficient and vowed to press on even as police indicated they might face arrest if they refused to leave the building upon its closure .
Their demonstration was reminiscent of a sit - in organized by House Democrats last month , in which lawmakers occupied the floor of the chamber for 26 hours in the pursuit of a vote on tougher gun restrictions .
The sit - in at Rubioâ€ ™ s office began at roughly 10 a.m. and has been dubbed as # SitInForThe49 on social media .
In addition to LGBT rights and gun control , protesters also cited police brutality as a prime area of concern .
Photos and videos from the event showed demonstrators singing â€œWe Shall Overcomeâ€ � and reading the names of the Orlando victims , whose names they also printed out and placed on the office floor along with red roses .
Patrick Murphy , the Florida congressman who is likely to be Rubioâ€ ™ s Democratic opponent in the Senate race , threw his support behind the effort .
â€œThis kind of brave demonstration should inspire us all to pass meaningful legislation to prevent future tragedies , â€ �
Murphy said in a statement .
â€œUnfortunately , Marco Rubio has doubled down on his opposition to commonsense gun violence prevention efforts and has yet to acknowledge that this was a hate crime against the LGBT community .
Itâ€ ™ s clear that Floridians have had enough of Marco Rubio putting his political ambition above the people he is supposed to represent.â€ �

Obamaâ€ ™ s public remarks have been more staid .
In Warsaw on Saturday , Obama said that while â€œthere is sorrow , there is anger , there is confusionâ€ � about how the US will move forward , â€œthereâ€ ™ s unity in recognizing that this is not how we want our communities to operate .
This is not who we want to be as Americans , and that serves as the basis for us being able to move forward in a constructive and positive way.â€ �
In an interview with Buzzfeed News , former Virginia governor and oft - forgotten Republican presidential candidate Jim Gilmore said that the â€œNever Trumpâ€ � movement within the Republican party is bad for the party , and that his goal is to â€œdraw the party together.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve not been supportive of Never Trump , â€ �
Gilmore said .
â€œI think that we need to unify the Republican party .
Thatâ€ ™ s very hard right now with the Never Trump movement .
My goal is , Jim Gilmoreâ€ ™ s goal is , to draw the party together.â€ �
Asked whether Trump could prevail in the former governorâ€ ™ s home state , Gilmore was hazy .
â€œItâ€ ™ s too soon , â€ �
Gilmore said .
Earlier , former House speaker and current potential Republican running mate Newt Gingrich told the Associated Press that it wouldnâ€ ™ t be an â€œautomatic yesâ€ � if he were extended an offer to serve as the Republican vice presidential nominee .
When asked about that comment by NBC Newsâ€ ™ Shaquille Brewster , Gingrich elaborated that he wouldnâ€ ™ t automatically accept the offer because he has a book coming out soon .
â€œCallista
and I have a lot of things going on right now ,
â€ �
Gingrich said .
â€œWe each have a book coming out .
We just released a movie on George Washington called First American , we have an exciting new project on women of the American revolution ,
so weâ€ ™ d want to stop and talk through exactly what heâ€ ™ d have in mind and , um , whether or not at a practical level we can make the transition.â€ �
When asked what his â€œgutâ€ � was telling him , Gingrich responded : â€œI have no idea.â€ �
Trump is expected to announce his choice by the end of the week .
Donald Trump is touting poll results from a survey has the presumptive presidential nominee winning Hispanics by 13 % , winning 18 % of Democrats and losing women by a mere 2 % .
Speaking on a Virginia radio station , presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump implied that the â€œstatus quoâ€ � embodied by former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic rival Hillary Clinton led to the assassination of five police officers in Dallas on Thursday evening .
â€œThe status quo , probably you could say that led to Dallas , â€ �
Trump said , â€œbut the status quo is going to just leave our country the way
it is.â€
�
Of Clinton , Trump continued : â€œSheâ€ ™ ll never change anything .
Because sheâ€ ™ s a - you know , if you look at it , and I say sheâ€ ™ s status quo all the time .
Our country needs real change and she can never do it.â€

Hillary Clinton could campaign much more aggressively against climate change than any US presidential candidate before her , under a draft platform adopted by Democratic party leaders , report the Guardianâ€ ™ s Suzanne Goldenberg and Oliver Milman .
The leaders committed the presumptive Democratic nominee to a carbon tax , a climate test for future pipelines and tighter rules on fracking â€ “ all stronger positions than those held by Clinton herself at the start of the race .
The Clinton camp said , after the platform was adopted , that she does not support a carbon tax and the draft still needs to be ratified at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia this month .
But the draft platform reflects the influence of Bernie Sanders and other liberals on the 2016 race , and the recognition by Clinton of the need to win over those supporters in swing states such as Colorado , Florida and Virginia where there is strong concern about climate change .
The bold stance could also help Clinton define Donald Trump as a climate denier who is out of touch with reality .
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a presidential candidate in possession of a yuge fortune must be in want of a decisive electoral victory in Florida .
Which is why itâ€ ™ s so odd that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has apparently shuttered his Sunshine State headquarters less than a week before the Republican National Convention .
According to the Tampa Bay Times , visitors to the candidateâ€ ™ s Sarasota - based state headquarters are greeted by a sign saying that the office is temporarily closed , purportedly to assist with Trumpâ€ ™ s national convention plans .
â€œOur office is temporarily closed to the public while our office works to prep for the National Convention in Cleveland , â€ � the sign says .
This is in keeping with Trumpâ€ ™ s skeleton - crew campaign , which has relied on free television appearances on major media networks in lieu of paid advertisements and has fewer operatives nationally than rival Hillary Clinton has in the state of Ohio .
Donald Trump has already tweeted a response to reports of a fatal shooting at a Michigan courthouse earlier this afternoon : Checking in with the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , where delegates are wrangling over everything from LGBT rights to education to pornography and , now , junk food .

Ginsburg also departed from the justicesâ€ ™ usual measured silence to praise a judge nominated to join her on the court , and to censure Republicans in the Senate , where theyâ€ ™ ve stalled hearings for that nominee .

She then told senators to do give him a hearing .

At no moment did Trump mention prisoners of war .

Trump insists that â€œdespite what she saysâ€

Her conduct was willful , intentional and unlawful.â€ � â€œSheâ€ ™ s probably the most surprised person to get away with it.â€ �
Heâ€ ™ s back to talking about her use of a private email server and the subsequent FBI investigation , which did not find evidence to bring a criminal case against her

He wants to ask for the authority to remove any employee who risks the health or safey of any veteran .
A commission to investigate Veterans Affairs and recommend legislation .
â€œIâ€
™ m going to make sure the honest and dedicated people at the VA have their jobs protected and are put in line for serious promotions if they continue to do good work.â€ �
He wants people , not phones , to respond to inquiries , 24 hours a day â€œto ensure that no valid complaint about the VA and its wrongdoing falls through the cracksâ€ � .
He says he wants complaints to come directly to him and â€œIâ€ ™ ll fix it myself if I have toâ€ � .
No more bonuses to people whoâ€ ™ re â€œwasting moneyâ€ � and new bonuses for people who are â€œsaving lives and cutting wasteâ€ � .
He wants to improve visa programs to ensure that veterans are â€œat the front of the lineâ€ � and not the back .
More mental healthcare facilities and professionals , and increase outreach to veterans whoâ€ ™ re outside the program â€ “ an expansion of government .
Finally he proposes â€œprivate medical care paid for by our governmentâ€ � .
â€œNever again will we allow a veteran to die waiting for care they so richly deserve .
They are great people , â€ � he says .
The businessman moves on to the â€œcorruptionâ€ � in the Veterans Affairs department , which he says has gone unrepaired under Barack Obama .
â€œEvery veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care , â€ � he promises .
â€œVeterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctors and clinics , whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center .
We must extend this right to all veterans.â€ �
The he goes back to praising current and past service members : â€œThey fought hard to protect us .
They are going to come first in a Trump administration .
They will be part of America first .
It will be America first from now on .
America first.â€ �
The Anti - Defamation League has asked Trump to stop using the phrase â€œAmerica
firstâ€ � , which has roots in a movement of Nazi sympathizers who wanted the US to stay neutral in the 1930s .
Amid his praise for veterans â€ “ â€œthe veteran is sacredâ€
� , he says â€ “ he does not say anything about prisoners of war such as John McCain , whom he has mocked at length
Trump says that the US has to live up to the promise it makes its soldiers : â€œYou defend America and America will defend you.â€ �
â€œThat promise has been broken by our politicians , like so many other promises our countryâ€ ™
s
made.â€ �
He blames Barack Obama for having not supported Veterans Affairs or healthcare ; that the president has â€œdenied them the helpâ€ � .
He says that such politicians live in a made - up reality , possibly because â€œtheyâ€ ™ re being paid millions of dollars to read from a telemprompter speeches to Wall Street executives instead of spending time with real people in real pain.â€
�
Heâ€ ™ s talking about the several million dollars that Hillary Clinton earned giving speeches to banks and other firms , but it rings strangely .
Trump is asking for hundreds of thousands of dollars from millionaires and billionaires , and himself claims to have billions and lives in a gilded tower with his extremely wealthy family .
â€œThere are two Americas : the ruling class and the groups it favors and then , everyone else , â€ � he says .
â€œOur inner cities are rife with crime ,
â€ �
Trump goes on â€
“ as the speech takes a darker tone .
He cites the Chicago Tribune on the gun violence epidemic in that city , one of the worst in the US .
He says â€œbrutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into Virginia and Marylandâ€ � .
â€œOur inner cities have been left totally behind .
And iâ€ ™ m going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home , a safe school and a safe community.â€ �
He says â€œwe will cease to have a country , 100%â€ � without police .
Then he declares : â€œI am the law and order candidate.â€ �
He says this is in contrast to Hillary Clinton , adding that he believes her brush with a FBI investigation into her email practices is evidence enough .
Then he adds also the â€œcompassionateâ€ � candidate .
â€œWithout safety , we have nothing.â€ �
Trump takes the stage in Virginia Beach .
â€œThank you .
Wow .
What a great group.â€
�
He thanks some more people â€ “ especially â€œthe men and women in blueâ€ � .
â€œOur police officers , we love our police office .
Our police officers rush into danger every single day to protect our communities and they often do so thanklessly and under relentless criticism.â€ �
Heâ€ ™ s
reading from a teleprompter : â€œI want our nationâ€ ™ s police to know that we thank you from the bottom of our heart.â€ � â€œWe support you , and we will always , always , always stand with you.â€ � â€œThe attack on our Dallas police is an attack on our country .
Our whole nation is in mourning and will be for a very long time .
Yet weâ€ ™ ve also seen increasing threats against our police.â€ � Heâ€ ™ s right that there have been more police deaths this year than in past years , though there are very few in general .
â€œItâ€ ™ s time for our hostility against our police , and against all members of law enforcement to end , and end immediately , right now.â€ �
Trump is about to speak on veterans , law and order in Virginia Beach , Virginia , where heâ€ ™ s getting an introduction from Chris Christie , the departing governor of New Jersey who quickly endorsed Trump and then spent several rallies staring into the middle - distance next to the businessman .
He says a Trump presidency means â€œbreaking the chinaâ€ � in government .
Heâ€ ™ s auditioning for vice - president .
More than 2,000 students , alumni and faculty of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania â€ “ aka the alma mater of Donald Trump â€ “ have written an open letter denouncing the candidate : â€œyou do not represent usâ€ � .
The highlight reel : â€œWe , proud students , alumni , and faculty of Wharton , are outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance.â€ � â€œYour insistence on exclusion and scapegoating would be bad for business and bad for the American economy .
An intolerant America is a less productive , less innovative , and less competitive America.â€ � â€œYour discriminatory statements are incompatible with the values that we are taught and we teach at Wharton.â€

â€œAlthough we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter , we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia , sexism , racism , and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign.â€

Hillary Clinton has received the endorsement of a major progressive group , another sign that Democrats are trying hard to fold Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ left wing of the party into Clintonâ€ ™ s coalition .
She released a statement that goes to great lengths to reassure the Americans who love Sanders and Elizabeth Warren that team Clinton is just as progressive as they are .
â€œI am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Congressional Progressive Caucusâ€ ™ Progressive Action PAC , â€ �
she said .
â€œFor
25 years , the CPC has been a champion for working people and on behalf of Americans who have been left out and left behind .
â€œWe are stronger when we have each othersâ€ ™ backs .
Thatâ€ ™ s why we will fight to secure universal health care , raise the minimum wage , and protect Americansâ€ ™ fundamental right to vote -- not corporationsâ€ ™ right to buy elections .
Itâ€ ™ s why we will face up to the reality of systemic racism , and fix it together .
And itâ€ ™ s why we will say â€˜noâ€ ™ to trade agreements like the Trans - Pacific Partnership that would hurt American workers , and fully enforce our trade laws to protect American jobs .
â€œWe are stronger when all our people can retire with dignity and security after years of hard work .
That is why we will stand up to Republican efforts to undermine or privatize the bedrock promise of Social Securityâ€”and weâ€ ™ ll fight to expand it .
â€œAnd we are stronger when we make our economy work for everyoneâ€”not just those at the top .
Thatâ€ ™ s why we will fight to make college debt - free and make the kinds of investments that will create good - paying jobs , with a bold plan to build 21st century infrastructure , revitalize American manufacturing , and combat climate change and make America a clean energy superpower .
â€œProgressives know that in America , we donâ€ ™ t tear each other down -- we lift each other up .
We believe in building bridges , not walls .
And we know that America is already greatâ€”because for 240 years , ours has been the story of hard - fought , hard - won progress.â€ � Donald Trump , heading for Virginia .
Trump will be joined by New Jersey governor Chris Christie .
They click personally , the Washington Post reports ... but Christie has a â€œstagnant and historically lowâ€ � popularity rating ...
Protesters are gathering outside the Virginia event : A few weeks ago Hillary Clinton sat down for a long interview with Vox editor Ezra Klein .
Vox posted the interview online today in full â€ “ you can watch below .
Itâ€ ™ s an intimate and sympathetic forum for Clinton .
Sheâ€ ™ s invited to plunge into policy details , to speak uninterrupted for minutes , without being challenged to defend potential weak spots in her record including the mixed legacy of welfare reform , her 1990s failure to shepherd health care reform , coziness with Wall Street and mixed tax policy votes as a senator ( the interview is devoted to domestic policy ) .
Here are links to separate chapters from the interview : Extreme poverty , welfare reform , and the working poor Is it time for more deficit spending ?

As he mulls a running mate , Donald Trump is leaning toward someone with political as opposed to military experience and he expects to make his mind up in the â€œnext three to four days , â€ � he tells the Washington Post .
While Trump was careful not to eliminate [ retired Lt Gov Michael Flynn , it was clear that he believed picking someone â€œpoliticalâ€
� was the right move , meaning , presumably , that former Speaker Newt Gingrich , Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and one other political person are in his final four .
Trump told the Postâ€ ™ s Chris Cillizza that he is not leaning toward picking an anti - establishment figure : â€œI donâ€ ™ t need two anti - establishment people , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œSomeone respected by the establishment and liked by the establishment would be good for unification .
I do like unification of the Republican party.â€ �

The former president is expected to speak .
According to the White House , Obama will deliver remarks at an interfaith memorial service at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center with the families of the fallen police officers and members of the Dallas community â€œwhose unity is reflective of who we are as Americansâ€ � : He will also meet privately with the families of the fallen police officers and those who were injured to personally express the nationâ€ ™ s support and gratitude for their service and sacrifice .
The Vice President will attend .
President and Mrs. George W. Bush will also attend , and President Bush will deliver brief remarks .
An open - records request filed by the Republican national committee has shaken loose some interesting documents and correspondence pertaining to paid speeches delivered by Bill Clinton .
â€œContracts and internal emails connected to half a dozen speeches Clinton gave in the Bay Area soon after departing the White House offer a glimpse into the unusual demands and outsize expense reports associated with bringing him to town ,
â€ � according to a Los Angeles Times report : They show a former president who deftly avoided discussing past scandals by refusing questions that were not screened by his staff in advance .
There is the nearly $ 1,400 bill for a dayâ€ ™ s worth of phone calls from San Franciscoâ€ ™ s Fairmont Hotel and the $ 700 dinner for two .
And they also show that an agency representing Clinton continued to pursue a deal with an event host who emailed a racist remark about audiences and jokingly referred to the male aides Clinton traveled with as his mistresses .

Bernie Sanders has cleared the way for an endorsement of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday , and declared a successful end to his campaign to pull their party to the left during weekend negotiations over the Democratic policy platform , write the Guardianâ€ ™ s Dan Roberts and Lauren Gambino : â€œWe have made enormous strides , â€ � said Sanders in a statement issued after a meeting in Orlando that swung the party in his direction on the minimum wage , climate change and marijuana though failed to make headway on fracking and trade .
â€œThanks to the millions of people across the country who got involved in the political process
â€ “ many for the first time â€ “
we now have the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic party ,
â€ � he said .
Typically , the public pays little attention to this non - binding agenda for the national convention , but Sanders pushed hard to ensure changes as the price of encouragement to his millions of supporters to back Clinton , despite their often bitter fight for the nomination .

Move over , Ted Cruz : House speaker Paul Ryan will lend his star power to Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s national convention , with a primetime speaking slot lined up for Tuesday night , Politico reports : The speech â€œwill be 10 minutes long , and will focus on the House Republican agenda and â€˜the sharp contrast between Republican ideas and four more years of Obama - like progressive policies ; and the need for conservatives to unite around Republican candidates in advance of a critical election , â€ ™ per an aide .
The Trump campaign has said Iowa senator Joni Ernst will also have a prime - time speaking slot next week .
Former two - term Democratic senator and Indiana governor Evan Bayh will seek to return to the US senate , CNN reports , in a boost for Democrats hoping to take back the senate majority in November .
Bayh will run to replace retiring Republican senator Dan Coats , according to an anonymous source quoted by CNN .
At a glance , Bayh would appear to be a strong contender to take back the seat for Democrats .
After being nominated for reelection in 2010 , the popular Hoosier politician unexpectedly left the race â€ “ but retained upwards of $ 9 m in his campaign arsenal , money that could be used for the current campaign .
Democrats would need to flip five senate seats to gain an outright majority .
Out of 24 Republican - held senate seats on the ballot this fall , at least five â€ “ and now six â€ “ appear vulnerable to a Democratic upset .
These include Illinois ( Kirk ) , Wisconsin ( Johnson ) , Pennsylvania ( Toomey ) , Ohio ( Portman ) and New Hampshire ( Ayotte ) .
Senator Marco Rubio appears off to a strong start at retaining his seat in Florida .
Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Westfield , Indiana , on Tuesday .
Trumpâ€ ™ s perceived weakness at the top of the ticket could have informed the decision in Indiana :
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Bernie Sanders is set to endorse Hillary Clinton in a joint appearance on the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Tuesday , his campaign has confirmed .
It would be the candidatesâ€ ™ first appearance together as explicit allies in the presidential race .
Clinton announced significant policy initiatives last week that were coordinated with the Sanders campaign and seemingly designed to encourage his supporters to accept her as a standard bearer for the cause .
She called for a moratorium on student debt and tuition aid , and for federal funds for community health clinics and an expansion of Medicare .
But not everyoneâ€ ™ s convinced :
Trump announces communications hires As meetings get under way at the Republican national convention in Cleveland , Ohio , Donald Trump has announced the hiring of a new director of campaign surrogates and a new director for rapid response .
The latter spokesperson , Steven Cheung , is a veteran of the 2008 Republican presidential ticket but most recently served as director of communications for the Ultimate Fighting Championship .
Trump goes looking for a very large handout
In hopes of closing the fundraising gap with Clinton , Trump will attend two top - flight fundraisers in Rancho Santa Fe and Bel Air , California , next week

One possibility not on that list , retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn , is a former head of the defense intelligence agency , an Obama critic â€ “

Ohio governor John Kasich , who suspended his own presidential campaign in May , remains opposed to the Trump candidacy and deeply ambivalent about the circus coming to town , according to a Washington Post report : Thanks for reading and please join us in the comments ."
2016-07-12,"The Colorado delegation to the Republican national convention has long been one of the most vocal redoubts of opposition to Donald Trump in the Republican party .
But emails shared with the Guardian reveal how divisive the conflict over Trump has become , with supporters of the GOP nominee comparing Never Trumpers to opponents of Jesus Christ and using a 12-year - old to make threatening phone calls to coax anti - Trump delegates into supporting him .
In a thread started when Patrick Davis , the Trump campaignâ€ ™ s director in the Rocky Mountain State , emailed the entire delegation with a link to sign up to volunteer , supporters of both Trump and Ted Cruz engaged in angry recriminations .
The emails were shared with the Guardian by a source within the delegation .
Cruz swept the delegate selection process in April when Colorado held its state convention .
Colorado is one of three states that does not hold a primary or any other form of voting in its primary process .
Instead , delegates are elected in a convention by party activists and are free to back candidates of their choosing .
Cruz won all 34 delegates up for grabs in the state , and his supporters there have long resisted efforts by Trump to become the partyâ€ ™ s nominee as they feel he is insufficiently conservative .
One delegate from Colorado , Kendal Unruh , is the leader of the effort to â€œfree the delegatesâ€ � in a last - ditch attempt to thwart Trump from becoming the nominee .
Davisâ€ ™ s initial email bluntly stated : â€œTo get involved in the Trump campaign in Colorado you should sign up at the following link : http://cologop.org / volunteer/.
You can also send an email to info@cologop.org
and they will get you plugged into the field office closest to you to start walking or volunteering.â€
�
This led to a cascade of criticisms and complaints from those skeptical of Trump .
Many shared their resentment of the statement by Sarah Palin that those Republicans opposed to Trumpâ€ ™
s candidacy were Rats ( her acronym for â€œRepublicans against Trumpâ€ � ) .
They cited lyrics from Les MisÃ © rables and their desire to â€œpreserve the true conservative values of the partyâ€ � in their refusal to support Trump , and railed against the presumptive nominee as â€œa charlatanâ€ � and even â€œa dirtbagâ€ � .
None showed signs of moderation .
As one said : â€œIâ€ ™ m a CAT ( Conservative Against Trump ) and voting Hillary for Prison.â€ �
They saw Trump as â€œnot an actual Republicanâ€ � .
In particular , there was a deep resentment at what they called â€œsoft thug tacticsâ€ � by Trump supporters to encourage them to support the presumptive nominee .
One candidate for alternate received a voicemail from a 12-year - old who insisted he was speaking on behalf of both the Trump campaign and the Colorado Republican party and said that the Colorado Republican party wanted nothing to do with the effort to â€œfree the delegatesâ€ � .
Davis soon clarified that the 12-year - old was only speaking on behalf of the Trump campaign and warned gravely : â€œI think every Colorado delegate to Cleveland has to examine their conscience and live with the guilt that comes with voting to weaken Donald Trump , our Republican nominee.â€ �
Another was told in a phone call from the 12-year - old Trump supporter that those seeking to free the delegates were somehow plotting to steal nomination from the real estate developer and hand it to Jeb Bush .
In return , one Trump alternate , Kimberly JaJack , compared those Republicans opposed to the real estate developer to â€œthe Pharisees who were critical of and critized [ sic ] by Jesusâ€ � .
This led one anti - Trump figure to express alarm that supporters of the candidate were comparing him to Jesus .
JaJack also railed against state GOP chairman Steve House , who is supporting Trump and was wearing a Trump pin at the Rules Committee in Cleveland on Tuesday , but has been tolerant of the â€œfree the delegatesâ€ � effort , saying Unruh has â€œthe right to propose or oppose any rule she feels is importantâ€
� .
This led JaJack to condemn the state party chair .
â€œHe certainly has not chosen to stand up for what is right for every human being in Godâ€ ™ s sight , â€ � she wrote .
â€œI am
Almighty Godâ€
™ s
witness of his bias.â€
�
The Republican national convention will convene on Monday in Cleveland and will decide then whether to allow Unruhâ€ ™ s effort to â€œfree the delegatesâ€ � to move forward ."
2016-07-20,"The third day of the Republican national convention is over and done .
Hereâ€ ™ s a summary of what happened : Ted Cruz did not endorse Donald Trump in a speech to the convention , and he was lustily booed by a crowd that had cheered much of his speech to that point .
â€œPlease , donâ€
™ t stay home in November , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œStand , and speak , and vote your conscience , vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.â€ �
Then he stood and waved to thousands booing .
Newt Gingrich came out after Cruz and said the crowd has misunderstood , that what Cruz said was in effect an endorsement of Trump because Trump was the only candidate faithful to the Constitution , see ?
A sense of deteriorating order in the arena was expanded by the flickering malfunctions of the Qâ€ ™ s jumbotrons as Eric Trump attempted to follow Cruz .
Vice presidential nominee Mike Pence won an enthusiastic , if not quite rapturous , reception for a smooth speech that framed the election efficiently thus :
â€œItâ€ ™ s change versus status
quo.â€ �
After Penceâ€ ™ s speech , the last of the evening and on the late side of things , Donald Trump came onstage to very strong cheering .
And mis - kissed his running mate : The big finale begins tomorrow just after 7 pm ET , with Donald Trump , preceded by daughter Ivanka .
Early in the night , conservative radio host Laura Ingraham threatened to steal the show with attacks on Hillary Clinton and the media and a call on Cruz ( not by name ) to endorse Trump .
Marco Rubio addressed the crowd by video before the Jumbotrons went out and said it was time to unify the party and get behind the nominee .
His pixels were cheered .
A Trump staffer released a statement inviting blame for the inclusion in Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech Monday of Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s words .
Trump said â€œwe all make mistakesâ€ � and declined to accept her resignation .
The secret service was investigating a Trump aide who said Hillary Clinton should be shot for treason .
The Trump campaign said the aide did not speak for their candidate .
Cleveland officials said a flag burning that turned into a melee resulted in the arrest of 18 people , bringing total RNC - related arrests to 23 .
A woman at the centre of sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump has spoken for the first time in detail about her personal experience with the billionaire tycoon who this week became the Republican nominee for president .
Googleâ€ ™ s data confirms what everyone in the arena felt : Boos for Cruz was the nightâ€ ™ s big moment .

This from a man who delivered the keynote address at the 2012 convention and basically ignored the nominee : Donald Trump has made good on his promise to forgive more than $ 47 million in loans he made to his campaign during the primary season , reports the AP : New federal campaign finance reports show the GOP presidential nominee no longer is carrying a balance on his loans .
Thatâ€ ™ s as he raised $ 21.9 million in contributions , leaving Trump with $ 20.2 million in the bank .
Trumpâ€ ™ s haul came after a disappointing May , when his campaign finished with $ 1.3 million .
The latest figures show the Republican Party had $ 21.1 million cash on hand by July 1 .
The motion to adjourn is heard and is adopted .
Meet back here at 7.10pm tomorrow .
I think we have our answer on the music .
The band digs into its most ambitious cover yet .
Like Rush - ambitious : Hereâ€ ™ s that missed kiss , thanks to @imbeccable : The Teleprompter is running for the Greek priest but he prefers to look down at a printed text .
So theyâ€ ™ ve done funk and disco and country .
Theyâ€ ™ ve done the nominations and the vice presidential candidate and Newtâ€ ™ s gone out there .
What kind of music will they bring tomorrow ?
GE Smithâ€ ™ s saxophonist blows the sax out of â€œHow Sweet it is ( to be loved by you ) .
Chairman Priebus is back .
He introduces a Greek orthodox priest for the outro .
The delegates , an unusual number of whom are on the floor unusually late , stay there , for the most part , even as the upper stands empty .
The two men kind of bask in each othersâ€ ™ presence for a few seconds , smiling and chilling .
Then Trump retreats and Penceâ€ ™ s family comes out .
Mom Nancy , wife Karen and the three kids .
The soundtrack is Rodney Atkins , Itâ€ ™ s America .
Pence :
â€œTogether we will make America great again.â€ � Big cheers .
Pence steps back .
But he does not leave the stage .
Yet .
He stands and waves to cheers .
And thereâ€ ™ s Trump .
Air kiss from Trump to Pence .
Are we going to see Trump onstage ?
Heâ€
™ s left his seat .
Pence is starting to wind up .
He promises to pray daily if he becomes veep .
â€œI believe we have come to another rendezvous with destiny , â€ � he says .
â€œWe must ensure that the next president appointing justices to the supreme court is Donald Trump , â€ �
Pence says .
Then he mentions Benghazi , and the â€œlock her upâ€ � chant starts again .
Pence waits it out with a stern look on his face .
He says that Clinton should be disqualified â€œfrom ever serving as commander in chief of the armed forcesâ€ � because of Benghazi .
History teaches us that weakness arouses evil .
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy ... are a testament to this truth of history .
We can not have four more years of apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends .
Pence :
None of us should think for one second that this should be easy ...
you know this wonâ€ ™ t be Americaâ€ ™ s first glimpse of the Clinton machine in action , as Bernie Sanders can tell you .
And this time around , sheâ€ ™ ll have the press doing half of her work for her .
On issue by issue , he and I will take our case to the voters ...
we will win the hearts and minds of the American people with an agenda for a stronger and more prosperous America .
The establishment ... thinks itâ€ ™ s only a narrow range of voters who are giving Donald Trump a first look , â€ �
but thatâ€ ™ s not true , Pence asserts .
Pence names groups who might give Trump a second look : Union members , coal miners .
African Americans .
Hispanic Americans .
Pence says Americans want change but â€œthe other party has responded with a stale agenda and the most predictable of names.â€ �
Hillary Clinton wants a better title , and I would too if I was already Americaâ€ ™ s secretary of the status quo .
You know the choice
couldnâ€ ™ t be more clear .
.. we could choose a leader who will fight every day to make America great again .
Itâ€ ™ s change versus status quo .
And my fellow Americans , when Donald Trump is elected president of the United States of America , the change will be YUGE .
Pence says that as he got to know Trump , he realized good things about him .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll grant you that he can be a little rough with politicians on the stage - and I bet we see that
againâ€ �
but he has â€œrespect for people that work for himâ€ � and â€œdevotion to his family.â€
�
â€œAs
we say back home ,
â€˜you canâ€ ™ t
fake good kids.â€ ™
How about his children ?
Arenâ€ ™ t they something .
These are the true measures of our nominee.â€ � Applause .
Pence gets a cheer for saying the other party doesnâ€ ™ t understand why Trump is winning just like the media doesnâ€ ™ t understand it :
They keep thinking theyâ€ ™ ve done him in , only to wake up the next morning to find that Donald Trump is still standing and running stronger than ever before .
The man does not quit .
Pence all but compares him to a villain in a horror movie .
Pence continues , talking about his record of job creation in Indiana .
â€œWe like Mike!â€ � the crowd chants .
â€œWe like Mike !
We like Mike!â€
�
As Pence continues to speak , the Guardianâ€ ™ s Jonathan Freedland continues to interview delegates .
He finds as much passion in the Cruz supporters as in his detractors : Hereâ€ ™ s the moment Donald Trump enters the arena â€ “ just as Cruz gets his boo : Pence says his dad would have loved to be here tonight .
An â€œWould you join me in welcoming the light of my life , my mom ,
Nancy?â€ �
Nancy stands in yonder stands .
Pence brings hand to lips , his eyes twinkle a bit and he throws her a kiss .
Thatâ€ ™ s a sweet moment .
He introduces his wife Karen next , his wife of 31 years .
â€œThe most important job Iâ€ ™ ll ever have is spelled D - A - D ,
â€ � he says .
He says they have the three greatest kids in the world including a second lieutenant in the US marine corps , a writer and a college student .
Applause .
â€œIf you know anything about Hoosiers , you know we love to suit up and compete , â€ � he says .
Thatâ€ ™ s why he said yes in a heartbeat .
â€œOn November 8th , I know we will elect Donald Trump to be the 45th president of the United States of AMerica.â€ �
Lots of cheers at that line .
Pence says â€œIâ€ ™ m a Christian , a conservative and a Republican in that order.â€ �
He says he never thought heâ€ ™ d be standing there .
â€œYet there I was , a few days ago in New York City , with the man who won 37 states.â€ �
Pence doesnâ€
™ t mention how Trump flew him to New York then left him in limbo for a day while he decided whether to dump him .
Pence then scores two laughs in a row .
He notes that Trump has style and charisma .
â€œSo
I guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket.â€
�
Ha !
Then this : â€œWell , for those who donâ€ ™ t know me , which is most of you ...
â€ �
Another laugh .
Ryan calls for the election of Donald Trump as president .
He is behind the movement , aboard the train : I have no doubt that he will bring real change to Washington .
I have every confidence that he will do us all proud .
Then he introduces Pence and thereâ€ ™ s a great deal of cheering .
Pence comes out and looks great with an electric blue tie against a background of the same color .
And the white - shirt white - hair thing .
Really works .
He says he accepts the nomination .
The crowd cheers and cheers .
House speaker Paul Ryan comes out to introduce Indiana governor Mike Pence , the vice presidential nominee .
â€œI could not be more proud of our vice presidential nominee , â€ � Ryan says .
â€œ ...
This is a man of solid character ... who sees public service as a calling not a career ...
the results are impressive.â€ �
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Jonathan Freedland was with the delegates as they began to realize â€ “ and then grow angry at the fact â€ “ that Cruz was not going to endorse Donald Trump :
Breaking :
Gingrich flips over to national security .
â€œDonald
Trump is right ,
â€ � he says .
â€œWe are at war with radical Islamists , we are losing the war , and we must change course to win the war.â€ �
Then Gingrich says the media will distort what he says next :
Let me be very clear , because I know the news media will do their best to distort this .
We have nothing to fear from the vast majority of Muslims in the United States , or around the world .
The vast majority are peaceful .
They are often the victims of the violence themselves .
They are people we would be happy to have as our friends and neighbors .
That last line gets applause , to the crowdâ€ ™ s credit .
Thereâ€ ™ s a â€˜butâ€ ™ : The challenge is , when even a small percentage of a billion , six hundred million people support violence against those who disagree with them , that is still a giant recruiting base .
But donâ€ ™ t let Newt Gingrich tell you what Ted Cruz said .
Watch it again : Next Callista Gingrich introduces Newt Gingrich .
Newt Gingrich gets out there and tells the crowd , â€œI think you misunderstood one paragraph that Ted Cruz , â€ � a fantastic orator , said .
Gingrich says that Cruz said , â€œyou can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the constitution.â€ � Which means , says Gingrich : In this election , there is only one candidate who will uphold the constitution .
So , to paraphrase Ted Cruz , if you want to uphold the constitution of the United States , the only candidate this fall is the Trump - Pence ticket .
Donald Trump had sat through Eric Trumpâ€ ™ s speech but now heâ€
™ s left the stands , perhaps to duck backstage .
The Jumbotrons have winked out again .
Eric Trump calls out to people at home .
He says if youâ€ ™ re struggling to make a rental payment , â€œmy father is running for you.â€ �
Or a laborer forced out of a job by undocumented workers illegal immigrants ; energy workers denied a job by the EPA ; single mothers ; families with special needs children who canâ€ ™ t afford medical benefits for everyday needs .
â€œMy father is running for you.â€ �
He continues : Vote for the candidate who you know is running for the right reasons .
Vote for the candidate who has never been a politician .
Vote for the candidate who has never received a paycheck for our government .
Eric Trump calls Donald Trump â€œright , just and true.â€
�
Then he makes the patrician - not - politician argument , the rich manâ€ ™ s burden argument for picking Trump :
Vote for the one candidate who does not need this job .
He continues : â€œNever have I been more proud to be a Trump.â€
�
There is a lot of family affection on the table for this last part .
It gets either sappy or moving , depending on your perspective : Dad , you always taught by example .
You are my hero
you are my best friend , you are the next president of the United States .
God Bless America .
Eric Trump continues with an anecdote about Oprah Winfrey asking his father whether heâ€ ™ d ever run for president .
Trump said , â€œOnly if it got so bad that I had
no choice.â€ �
Eric Trump says : â€œWell ladies and gentlemen , that day has come.â€ �
He describes things he sees in his fatherâ€ ™ s eyes , specifically frustration at Americaâ€ ™ s crumbling infrastructure , failing schools and ballooning trade deficit .
But also Eric sees in his fatherâ€ ™ s eyes the look of someone who wants America to be great again .
The New York delegation chants Trump Trump Trump .
Eric Trump quote MLK Jr
: â€œThe most persistent question is what are you doing for others.â€ �
He begins to talk about the charity work of his foundation .
Eric Trump points out that Trump himself is in the house .
So he is , over there .
Eric Trump is listing the accomplishments of his father .
These include turning the presidential debates into â€œmust - see TV.â€ �
Trump says he saw his father grow frustrated with stuff that was going wrong in the USA .
â€œHe could no longer stand to see the words [ sic ] â€œChristmasâ€ � stripped from public use ...
so my father made the courageous decision to set aside a company to which he has devoted an entire life ... at a time when many people would have held fast to a lifestyle that has truly become the epitome of the American dream , â€ �
Trump sought to restore that dream to the people , Eric Trump says .
He says his dad is the best person to implement tax reform and introduce business sense and â€œnegotiate the return of countless American manufacturersâ€ � ...
â€œthan a many who has single - handedly employed tens and tens of thousands of people around this country .
â€œItâ€ ™ s time for a president with common sense , â€ � Eric Trump says .
Well it appears Chris Jansonâ€ ™ s latest harmonica solo has finally killed all the video screens in the Quicken Loans arena .
Every Jumbotron in the place has flickered off .
As Eric Trump walks out , the Jumbotons go back on , but the LED crawlers ringing the arena at two levels are blinking on and off .
Itâ€ ™ s a strobe effect , a malfunction , distracting , the kind of thing that might come with a seizure warning .
Eric Trump dives into his speech anyway .
They finally get those crawlers turned off .
Here are those boos : Weâ€ ™ ve just had a video of Trumpâ€ ™ s children talking about their father .
They said good things without exception .
Now noted harmonica - ist Chris Janson is back , to sing an adapted version of a song called â€œTruck Yeah.â€ �
He makes it â€œTrump yeah.â€
�
The crowd realizes that Ted Cruz is coming to the end of his speech and that he will not endorse Trump , or even mention him again .
They are growing restive .
Chants and counter - chants , people standing and giving the old double - thumbs - down .
Cruz has come to the end of his prepared remarks , but heâ€ ™ s not rushing it .
He seems to be enjoying , somehow , the palpable rancor in the air .
He speaks these lines off the cuff : â€œThe case we have to make to the American people ..
is to commit that we will defend freedom and be faithul to the American constitution .
â€œWe will unit the party , unite the country , by standing forâ€ �
these freedoms.â€ � â€œGod bless each and every one of you and god bless the United States of America.â€
�
And the place goes wild , 18,000 booing people .
Cruz stands there and smiles and waves .
He doesnâ€ ™ t care .
Cruz :
We deserve leaders who stand for principle .
Unite us all behind shared values .
Cast aside anger for love .
That is the standard we should expect , from everybody .
And to those listening , please , donâ€ ™ t stay home in November .
If you love our country , and love your children as much as I know you do , stand , and speak , and vote your conscience , vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution .
Cruz here is both cheered and booed .
A rallying cry of Trump !
Trump ! breaks out , and a counter - cry of USA !
USA ! percolates .
Especially right in front of Cruz , where the New Yorkers are .
â€œI
appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation , â€ � Cruz says .
Then he returns to his prepared remarks : Itâ€ ™ s love of freedom that has allowed millions to achieve their dreams .
Like my Mom , the first in her family to go to college , and my Dad , who fled prison and torture in Cuba , coming to Texas with just $ 100 sewn into his underwear .
Cruz on the recent glories of the Republican party : Our party was founded to defeat slavery .
Abraham Lincoln , the first Republican president , signed the Emancipation Proclamation .
We passed the Civil Rights Act , and fought to eliminate Jim Crow laws .
Thatâ€ ™ s our collective legacy , although the media will never show it to you .
Cruz is speaking directly into cameras carrying his words to like 20 million people at least .
As Cruz speaks , thereâ€ ™ s a brief electrical outage ,
everything flickering , the big screens .
But itâ€ ™ s just a glitch .
The biggest applause line of Cruzâ€ ™ s speech so far
: We deserve an immigration system that puts America first .
And yes , builds a wall to keep us safe .
Then Cruz , recklessly and counterfactually , brands refugees as â€œIsis terrorists , â€ � as news reports emerge of dozens of Syrian civilians killed by US ordnance .
Cruz describes a bunch of things that â€œfreedom means , â€ � including freedom to have guns and freedom from other people having abortions .
Also , statesâ€ ™ rights : And freedom means recognizing that our Constitution allows states to choose policies that reflect local values .
Colorado may decide something different than Texas .
New York different than Iowa .
Diversity .
Thatâ€ ™ s the way itâ€ ™ s supposed to be .
If not , whatâ€ ™ s the point of having states to begin with ?
Cruz says Clinton is anti freedom .
His lines about her are booed : Hillary Clinton believes government should make virtually every choice in your life .
Education , healthcare , marriage , speech
â€ “ all dictated out of Washington .
Cruz then touts the Brexit vote .
Big cheers now :
But something powerful is happening .
Weâ€ ™ ve seen it in both parties .
Weâ€ ™ ve seen it in the United
Kingdomâ€ ™ s unprecedented Brexit vote to leave the European Union .
Voters are overwhelmingly rejecting the political establishment and big government .
Thatâ€ ™ s a profound victory .
The room is absolutely packed for Cruz , the fullest itâ€ ™ s been yet .
He has progressed gracefully through a few movements : the tragic story of the daughter of an assassinated officer ; the American ideal ; the sins of the Democrats , and now a â€œvision for our futureâ€ � :
Theirs is the party that thinks ISIS is a â€œJV team , â€ � that responds to the death of Americans at Benghazi by asking , â€œWhat difference does it
make?â€
�
That thinks itâ€ ™ s possible to make a deal with Iran , which celebrates as holidays â€œDeath to America Dayâ€ � and â€œDeath to Israel Day.â€
�
My friends , this is madness .
President Obama is a man who does everything backwards
â€ “ he wants to close Guantanamo Bay and open up our borders , he exports jobs and imports terrorists .
Enough is enough .
And I am here to tell you , there is a better vision for our future
: A return to freedom .
Cruz has left Trump behind , apparently for good .
He gets a good bit of applause for a line about Americans having no king .
Then he almost says that American exceptionalism comes down to Freddie Mercury : America is more than just a land mass between two oceans .
America is an idea , a simple yet powerful idea : freedom matters .
For much of human history , government power has been the unavoidable constant in life â€ “ government decrees , and the people obey .
Not here .
We have no king or queen .
No dictator .
We the People constrain government .
Our nation is exceptional because it was built on the five most powerful words in the English language : I want to be free .
Never has that message been more needed than today .
Cruz tells the story of Michael Smith , one of five officers shot dead in Dallas .
The story becomes a call to action : As I thought about what I wanted to say tonight , Michael Smithâ€ ™ s story weighed on my heart .
Maybe thatâ€ ™ s because his daughter , Caroline , is about the same age as my eldest daughter and happens to share the same name .
Maybe itâ€ ™ s because I saw a video of that dear , sweet child choking back sobs as she remembered her daddyâ€ ™ s last question to her .
Maybe itâ€ ™ s because we live in a world where so many others have had their lives destroyed by evil , in places like Orlando and Paris and Nice and Baton Rouge .
Maybe it is because of the simple question itself : What if this , right now , is our last time ?
Our last moment to do something for our families and our country ?
Did we live up to our values ?
Did we do all we could ?
Ted Cruz is announced and appears .
People clap forever and whistle .
Some boo .
â€œThank
you and god bless each and every one of you
, â€ � he says .
Thank you .
Heidi and I are honored to join you here in Cleveland , where Lebron James just led an incredible comeback victory .
Iâ€ ™ m convinced America is going to come back too .
I want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night .
And like each of you , I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November .
Conventions are times of excitement .
But given the events of the last few weeks , I hope youâ€ ™ ll allow me a moment to talk to you about whatâ€ ™ s really at stake .
Whoa here suddenly is Marco Rubio , addressing crowd via JumboTron .
He attacks Hillary Clinton over Benghazi .
â€œUnlike Hillary Clinton , Donald Trump is committed to cut taxes , curb spending ...
[ he ] takes seriously the threat from Islamic radicals ...
â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s video image gets applause for saying this :
The time for fighting each other is other .
Itâ€ ™ s time to come together and fight for a new direction for America .
Itâ€ ™ s time to ( inaudible ) .
While Lynne Patton tells the crowd about the virtues of her boss Donald Trump , we want to flag this non - politics story : The band strikes up .
Whoâ€ ™ s up next ?
Looks like Lynne Patton of the Eric Trump foundation .
The bandâ€ ™ s doing one of their hits from last night , a cover of REO Speedwagonâ€ ™ s Roll With the Changes .
A video is rolling now .
Is Lynne Patton going to address the crowd only by video ?
The video is a slide show of people â€ “
itâ€
™ s unclear who â€ “ with a voiceover by an unidentified someone who could be Lynne Patton .
â€œThe Trump family has stood by me through lots of difficult times without concern about their reputations by association , â€ � the unidentified narrator says , interestingly .
Tell us more ?
â€œFor the past six years
I have held an executive position as it pertains to the distribution of their charitable funds
, â€ � the voice says .
Must be Lynne Patton .
She says â€œthis is the right thing to do ... for me it was an easy decision , just as voting for my boss , Donald J Trump , should be for you ,
â€ � she says .
Oh wait there
she is in person !
Lynne Patton .
Hello America !
she says .
She refers again to â€œmy boss , Donald J Trump.â€ � Feels like a sales conference , reminiscent of the moment last night when the Trump vineyard executive spoke .
Next up : governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin .
â€œAmerica deserves betterâ€
� is his refrain .
There are special signs in the audience with those words on them .
But is it a great look , for Scott Walker , a sharp critic of Trump once , to stand on the stage at Trumpâ€ ™ s convention and lead the crowd chants of â€œAmerica deserves betterâ€
� ?
Some people jumped the gun with the signs :
Hereâ€ ™ s Walkerâ€ ™ s first big applause line :
Hillary Clinton is the ultimate liberal Washington insider .
If she were any more on the â€œinside , â€ �
sheâ€ ™ d be in prison .
America deserves better than Hillary Clinton .
Then Walker explicitly calls for support for Trump : That is why we need to support Donald Trump and Mike Pence for President and Vice President .
Last August , I said that any of the Republicans running would be better than Hillary Clinton .
I meant it then , and I mean it now .
So let me be clear : a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump in November is a vote for Hillary Clinton .
Hereâ€ ™ s Ingraham calling on Cruz and others to endorse Trump :
And Trump tweets thanks for her speech : Scott is a great orator .
His speech was not much as written
but he worked it for big waves of cheers :
He believes , as do you and as I do , that we can become great again , and we can become strong again , if we have strong leadership .
And I can think of no stronger leader who will place their left hand on a Bible that they believe in , raise their right hand and solemnly swear to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and to the best of his ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States of America than Donald J. Trump .
They cheered it like crazy , big standing O. Nothing in the words .
All in the delivery .
Scott is yelling lines from the Declaration of Independence and winning big cheers for it .
The Declaration of Independence is awesome .
â€œDonald Trump has played the big stakes , and he is a master dealer and negotiator ... the art of the deal is to bring people together to unify and to get them from no to yes
, â€ � Scott says .
â€œHe now wants to take that experience to get the best deal for America.â€ � Kentucky state senator Ralph Alvarado , Jr , delivers lines in Spanish .
The crowd cheers him excitedly .
Then they strike up the band a bit , a little instrumental interlude to fill out the 8 oâ€ ™ clock hour , it appears .
Next up is Dr. Darrell C. Scott , Senior Pastor and Co - Founder of New Spirit Revival Center Ministries .
He says he gets together with Donald Trump to discuss race relations and other things .
â€œDespite his many accomplishments , he feels a void that he feels can only be filled by service to his country and service to his fellow Americans , â€ � he says .
We take back what we said about Van Etten .
She closes with a crushing set of lines that get a mere fraction of the applause they deserve , weâ€ ™ d say : There is only one man capable of this juggling act .
Only one man who can take the circus weâ€ ™ ve inherited from the last eight years and serve as the ultimate ringmaster .
There is only one man who can preserve and protect the American Dream for future generations .
That man is Donald Trump .
Thank you .
Van Etten has lost the audience .
She slices the air and speaks loudly but can barely raise a whoop - whoop .
And glancing at the speakers list , it looks like a potentially drowsy march until we get to the electrifying Scott Walker .
The next three speakers are : State Senator Ralph Alvarado , Jr. ( Kentucky )
Dr. Darrell C. Scott , Senior Pastor and Co
- Founder of New Spirit Revival Center Ministries Harold Hamm ,
Continental Resources Hereâ€ ™ s Michelle van Etten , fake employer .
The RNC bio says this : Michelle Van Etten is a small business owner who was recently featured in The Greatest Networkers in the World , second edition .
Michelle employs over 100,000 people , and she supports Donald Trumpbecause she believes that his policies will support businesses across America .
But in fact van Etten employs zero people , the Guardianâ€ ™ s Jon Swaine reports : Hereâ€ ™ s the crux of Van Ettenâ€ ™ s speech : Planning for my 20th high school reunion , I decided to check out the girls I went to school with .
What I noticed was that my girlfriends looked like Barbies and drove BMWs .
I was 30 pounds overweight , a stay at home mom and drove a minivan .
I decided I needed a change .
I began to dream again .
I took a leap of faith and started my own network marketing business from home .
Like many people who pursue a dream , I had to learn how to fail forward and never quit .
I also had to become the type of person I wanted in my business .
Within just two years , my husband was able to retire from 28 years at DOD .
Jim Van Etten now homeschools our kids because we choose not to subject them to Common Core .
I opened a fashion studio called MV House of Style in Brandon , Florida .
Today I run a thriving multi - faceted business .
I am living the American Dream .
Next up is Eileen Collins , the first woman to lead a space shuttle mission .
â€œThe last time the United States launched our own astronauts from our own soil was over five years ago , â€ � she says .
She is calling for a renewed investment in space exploration .
This is not a political speech .
Itâ€ ™ s a Nasa PSA .
Except she does say at the end , â€œwe need leadership that will make America great again.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s hoping Newt Gingrich , futurist and aspiring Mars colonist , gets to talk to Collins backstage .
Hereâ€ ™ s more on Phil Ruffin , the Trump - friend - businessman who spoke after Ingraham : Donald Trump Jr , denying a New York Times report on a conversation he had with the John Kasich camp , asks the world , â€œwhat am I , a meathead?â€ � â€œLock her up , I love that , â€ � Bondi says .
The crowd tries to chant it , but Bondi stops them .
â€œHang on ,
â€ �
she says ,
so she can say this : Heâ€ ™ ll roll back Obamaâ€ ™ s unconstitutional executive orders .
Heâ€
™ ll enforce immigration laws to keep us safe , while allowing legal immigrants to bless this nation with their talents and their dreams .
And California , Texas , New Mexico , Arizona : Donald Trump will take control of our borders , because we must stop the influx of cocaine and heroin coming into our country and my state , killing our kids .
Ruffin wanders off .
Now hereâ€ ™ s Florida attorney general Pam Bondi , whom the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ed Pilkington describes like this : Bondi was a leading opponent of same - sex marriage , but since the [ Orlando ] massacre has been cozying up to gay leaders .
â€œShe came up to me and wanted to hug me , â€ � Sheehan said .
â€œShe
just doesnâ€ ™ t get it .
The woman honestly does not understand why the community is upset with her .
What these people do not understand is that by fighting against my rights , they helped create this climate of terrorism and hatred.â€ � Ruffin is swiftly draining the energy from the room .
â€œHe has that Mar - a - Lago .
He loves Florida , â€ � Ruffin says .
He says he built the Trump hotel with Trump in Las Vegas .
â€œBeautiful hotel ...
we had almost 1,300 units , and they were sold out in 90 days .
Ninety days.â€ �
But with the 2009 recession , they were stuck with 75 % of units empty .
â€œYou had $ 500 m in debt .
What do you do ?
Donald does not give up .
He said , letâ€ ™ s make the damn thing work , and he did.â€ � None of that was on the Teleprompter .
Heâ€
™ s riffing .
â€œHe always pays his bills promptly .
No discounts .
Nobody lost any money on it .
Today we have 80 % sold .
We have no debt.â€
�
Now Ruffinâ€ ™ s first sort - of - applause line : â€œHe wants to do the same thing for this country.â€
�
Another huge line - an even bigger one - from Ingraham , who , a syndicated radio host , this time trashes the media .
Yes
itâ€ ™ s definitely a bigger line .
Theyâ€ ™ re still cheering .
Itâ€ ™ s an absolutely electric moment .
Pretending to point at the media row â€ “ weâ€ ™ re actually off to the side , she points up â€ “ she says , â€œyou all know in your hearts why Donald Trump won.â€ �
â€œYou all know , â€ �
she says , pointing .
Because he dared to call out the phonies the frauds and the corruption that has gone unexposed and uncovered for too long .
Too long .
Do your job !
Huge cheers .
She closes :
Letâ€ ™ s elect Donald Trump president of the United States !
Big cheers and applause as she leaves the stage .
A USA ! chant .
Then sheâ€ ™ s followed by a guy in sunglasses who says that Donald Trump , â€œas a friend , is unbelievable.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s Phil Ruffin , businessman .
Hereâ€ ™ s the RNC bio : Ruffin is an American businessman with diverse interests in real estate , lodging , manufacturing , energy , and retail enterprises .
Ruffin started his business in 1959 with a single convenience store and expanded it into an operation with 65 stores in four states .
He currently holds 12 hotels in Kansas , Maryland , California , Oklahoma , Texas , and Alabama .
Ingraham addresses former presidential candidates who vowed to support the Republican nominee , Ted Cruz among them , to make good on their promise :
WE love you , we love you .
But you must honor your pledge to support Donald Trump now .
Tonight .
Tonight .
The crowd roars to its feet , again .
And there is sustained applause and cheering .
Itâ€ ™ s a home run line .
â€œI hope they are listening ,
â€ � she says .
â€œI hope they are listening.â€
�
Hereâ€ ™ s conservative radio host Laura Ingraham .
Sheâ€ ™ s got the crowd on its feet .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a single mother of three adopted children .
Iâ€ ™ m here tonight supporting Donald Trump because like most Americans , I refuse to leave them a country that is worse off than the one my parents left me , â€ � she says .
Sheâ€ ™ s interrupted repeatedly by calls to â€œLock her up !
Lock her up!â€
�
And one guy yells , â€œWe love
you!â€ �
â€œDonald Trump understands that we must turn this around and restore respect across all levels of society .
Unlike us , Hillary Clinton believes the status quo is just fine because she helped create it .
â€œDonald
Trump knows that a nation without borders isnâ€ ™ t a nation at all .
But Hillary Clinton ?
Nah , she doesnâ€ ™ t believe in borders.â€ �
Weâ€ ™ ve just heard from Florida governor Rick Scott , who was slow to endorse Trump but saw the writing on the wall when Trump smashed home state senator Marco Rubio .
Scott said in part : I cried with the grieving moms and dads and brothers and sisters of the 49 people slaughtered by an ISIS - inspired terrorist .
This war is real .
It is here in America .
And the next president must destroy this evil .
Donald Trump is the man for that job .
â€œToday , America is in terrible , world - record - high debt .
Our economy is not growing .
Our jobs are going overseas .
We have allowed our military to decay , and we project weakness on the international stage .
Washington grows while the rest of America struggles .
The Democrats have not led us to a crossroads , they have led us to a cliff.â€ �
The crowd is getting into Chris Janson , whoâ€ ™ s doing another harmonica solo , blowing hard as Hannity .
â€œAre you ready to party baby , RNC here
we go!â€ � he says .
Whenâ€ ™ s
Rick Scott going to come out ?
Itâ€ ™ s only 8 pm .
Janson has another .
This song appears to be called â€œBack in my drinkinâ€ ™ days.â€ �
Yup .
Janson takes another harmonica solo , prefaced by the callout , â€œWhoâ€ ™ s ready to hear 135 pounds of skinny white guy play this harmonica like you ainâ€
™ t never seen baby?â€
�
Man that guy can play the harmonica .
â€œI wrote this song for some friends of mine , it was a great big number one this year , â€ � Janson says .
If you like America , he advises , â€œmake some noise in this house.â€
�
He sings the song I Love This Life which as nobody needs to be told was a huge huge hit for Locash .
I love my boots broke in , I love my Camo hat Donâ€ ™ t mind a little paint on my jeans ,
yeah
I roll like that I love driving my truck across the railroad tracks If you hit it too quick , itâ€ ™ ll hit ya right back
I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on How it shines like gold when the sun turned on I love the sound of them wheels with my baby singing along When â€œThe Boys Of Summerâ€ � comes on I love my small town world , I love a country girl I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an olâ€ ™ dirt road Rollinâ€ ™ through mind
Man
I love , man I love ,
Man , I Love This Life
I Love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays I love that taste of her lips when sheâ€ ™ s been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time I love my small town world , I love a country girl I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an olâ€ ™ dirt road Rolling through mind
Man , I love , man I love ,
Man , I Love
This Life
Oh - o - o - o -
oh Man
I love this life
Oh - o - o - o - oh Man , I love this life ( I love this life ,
I love this life , I love this life )
I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church , out on 109
Itâ€ ™ s where I hit my knees and thank the Lord for this life of mine
Now country music star Chris Janson is singing an up - tempo , dare we say country - punk cover of Johnny Cashâ€ ™ s
Ring of Fire .
â€œMake some noise ,
RNC!â€ �
Janson calls out .
Most excited delegation : California , home to Folsom and San Quentin .
Least excited : saying Arizona , who are texting .
Texas is waving their hats .
Hereâ€ ™ s country music star Chris Janson , singing his smash hit â€œBuy me a boatâ€ � .
Last night was disco and funk night .
Tonightâ€ ™ s itâ€ ™ s country .
â€œHey RNC how you doinâ€
™ tonight baby?!?â€
� Chris Janson says .
They cheer , and he goes into a harmonica solo that would give John Popperâ€ ™ s tongue career - ending cramps if he tried it .
Hereâ€ ™ s Sweet Caroline .
And yes thatâ€ ™ s Florida :
Thereâ€ ™ s the pledge of allegiance .
Now Abby Paskvan sings the national anthem .
She killed it , in a performance anticipated by her mic check earlier : The announcer has just interrupted the bandâ€ ™ s cover of â€œSweet Carolineâ€ � to ask people to take their seats and she basically ends up on the receiving end of a basketball - arena - sized Go to Hail .
These people arenâ€ ™ t going to sit down in the middle of â€œSweet Caroline.â€ � OK
itâ€ ™ s over and hereâ€ ™ s Reince Priebus again .
He introduces a boy scout troop who are bringing in the flags .

The delegates are all in the hall , and the band has once again begun .
My Sharona is the hit cover tune of the moment .
Thereâ€ ™ s some dancing .
Especially among the representatives of a certain popular holiday state .
If you havenâ€ ™ t been watching the Infowars livestream , with conspirator - in - chief Alex Jones , you may have missed comedian Tim Heidecker crashing it and doing a pretty good Alex Jones impression ( this is via Dave Weigel of the Washington Post ) :
A border wall appeared around the Trump star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday .
The work is credited to the artist Plastic Jesus .
Who paid for it ?
Your guess is as good as ours .
It was gone by Wednesday .
Weâ€ ™ re pleased tonight to be able to serve up a live video stream of tonightâ€ ™ s proceedings .

Cruz cut off by Trump plane : â€˜That was pretty well orchestratedâ€ ™ â€ “ video
In the aftermath of defeat in the 2012 presidential race , the Republican partyâ€ ™ s mandate was clear : make inroads with Latino voters , the fastest - growing bloc of the American electorate , or face the consequences at the ballot box , writes Guardian politics reporter Sabrina Siddiqui : On Thursday , Donald Trump will instead formally accept the Republican nomination for president at the partyâ€ ™ s convention in Cleveland with record - low approval ratings from Latino voters .
And even as Republican officials speak of ramping up outreach to the must - win demographic , the atmosphere is clearly affected by the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s unwavering line on immigration â€ “ from the unveiling of a Republican election platform , which emphasized the building of a border wall , to a speaking lineup that has included the parents of children killed by immigrants who entered the US illegally .
Many prominent Republicans fear Trumpâ€ ™ s name at the top of the ticket in November poses a threat not simply for their prospects of winning the White House but also for holding on to majorities in Congress .
â€œI think weâ€ ™ re likely to have the largest turnout ever of Latino voters to stop Donald Trump , â€ � said Whit Ayres , a Republican pollster who has argued that the partyâ€ ™ s 2016 nominee would need at least 40 % of the Latino vote to secure victory .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to have to do dramatically better than Mitt Romney did among white voters to counter the antagonism
heâ€
™ s created among Hispanics.â€ � [ ... ]
In a poll released just ahead of the Republican convention , Hillary Clinton held a 62-point advantage over Trump among Latino voters , leading 76 % to 14 % .
The NBC News / Wall Street Journal / Telemundo survey also found that 82 % of Latino voters viewed Trump unfavorably , compared with just 11 % who viewed him positively .

Nigel Farage , the former leader of the UK Independence party , has claimed that Barack Obama was unwittingly responsible for pushing Britain out of the European Union , reports Guardian Washington correspondent David Smith : â€œIâ€ ™ m a huge fan of Barack Obama , â€ � Farage said on Wednesday during a visit to the Republican national convention in Cleveland .
â€œWithout him
we wouldnâ€ ™ t have won the referendum .
He was very helpful.â€ �
The US president visited London in April and made an impassioned plea to Britons to remain in the EU .
The UK would be at the â€œback of the queueâ€ � in any trade deal with the US , he warned , speaking alongside David Cameron .
The leave victory in last monthâ€ ™ s Brexit referendum caught the White House by surprise .
Farage , speaking at a fringe event after meeting Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee , chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , suggested that Obamaâ€ ™ s intervention had backfired and that politicians should not meddle in another countryâ€ ™ s affairs .
â€œI shall always be grateful , eternally grateful to Obama because he came to our country , he was rude to us , he told us what we should do
and he led to a big Brexit bounce of several points ,
â€ � the leading Brexit advocate said .
â€œSo thank you , Obama , for helping us to win this referendum .
â€œThe moral of the story is I shanâ€ ™ t say at the end of this week who I think you should vote for , although I have to say , I wouldnâ€ ™ t vote for Hillary if you paid me .
Her sense of entitlement kind of puts me off.â€ � Laura Benanti nails impression of Melania Trump speech â€ “ video Triptych terror .
Is audience appetite for Trump waning ?
Has the nation hit saturation ?
Trump surrogates had said that 35 million people were watching primetime television coverage of the convention .
In fact , audience for night two of the convention was about 5/6 the size of the audience that watched the Fox debate at the start of the spectacle , the NY Timesâ€ ™ Mike Grynbaum reports : The Secret Service is investigating a prominent Donald Trump supporter who said Hillary Clinton should be â€œshot for treason , â€ � the AP reports : Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback says the agency is aware of comments made by New Hampshire state Rep. Al Baldasaro .
Hoback says the Secret Service â€œwill conduct the appropriate investigation.â€ �
Baldasaro said Clinton â€ ” a former secretary of state whoâ€ ™ s the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee â€
” should be â€œput in the firing line and shot for treasonâ€ � over the 2012 attacks in Benghazi , Libya , that killed four Americans .
Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks tells NH1 News that Baldasaro doesnâ€ ™ t speak for the campaign .

Politicians :
Janus - faced or what .
Last night here in Cleveland , New Jersey governor Chris Christie had Americaâ€ ™ s most fervent Republicans on their feet yelling â€œGuilty!â€ � and chanting â€œLock her up!â€
� as he
â€œprosecutedâ€ � Hillary Clinton for â€œcrimesâ€ � and misdeeds from Little Rock to Libya .
But it emerges that Christie missed his chance to make a citizenâ€ ™ s arrest in February , when he ran into Clinton on a CNN set in New Hampshire .
Instead of arresting her , he gave her one of his trademark hugs , and asked her to â€œsay hi to the president.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s video of a snapchat video circulated today by the Clinton campaign :
Meanwhile in Possum Trot ( h / t @timothymurphy )
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s chief adviser on veteranâ€ ™ s issues on Wednesday declared that Hillary Clinton â€œshould be put in the firing line and shot for treason.â€ �
( Earlier post here . )
But thatâ€ ™ s not how the candidate feels , Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks has reassured the Washington Post : Former house speaker Newt Gingrich , whoâ€ ™ s scheduled to speak tonight , has told CNN that Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s plagiarism dabbling is not really a problem because , in part , â€œshe is stunningly attractive.â€ �
As Newt well knows , beauty gets you everywhere .
The Cut blog at New York Magazine captures the Gingrich statement : â€œWho cares ?
The fact is Melania gave a good speech , she is stunningly attractive , sheâ€ ™ s stunningly articulate , [ and ] most of the people who are criticizing her canâ€ ™ t speak five languages .
Sheâ€ ™ s a bright person , she introduced herself in a way thatâ€ ™ s attractive , [ and ] sheâ€ ™ s obviously very passionate about America.â€ � Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts has been elected president and started work in the Oval Office .
Looks like the first 100 days in the Roberts presidency are going to be historic .
Actually , this is Dan on an Oval Office novelty set here at the Quicken Loans arena .
No word on whether Trump has stopped by yet .
Police have detained protesters in Public Square , and they report that two officers were â€œassaultedâ€ � :
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Paul Owen sends video of the detained protesters :
Trump is batting back at todayâ€ ™ s New York Times magazine report that he made a strong play for John Kasich to be his running mate .
The Timesâ€ ™ Robert Draper described an initial approach to the Kasich camp by Donald Trump Jr promising that Kasich could be in charge of foreign and domestic policy while Trumpâ€ ™ s task would be to â€œmake America great again.â€
�
The report described a phone conversation between Kasich and Trump in which they explored the idea .
Trump does not deny there were overtures but he does deny there was an outright offer made by him specifically to Kasich specifically .
Which the Times report did not claim in the first place .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Oliver Laughland is on Public Square , where a Bob Marley cover band is facing off with apocalypse Christians , horse turds are fermenting and all signs point to circus :
Meredith McIver , the Trump staffer who today has described her writerâ€ ™ s role in lâ€ ™ affaire Melania , turns out to have been a presence in a 2007 profile of Trump by Gaby Wood .
Hereâ€ ™ s a section of the profile , which warrants reading in full : Time being money , Trump springs up to hand me some propaganda : glossy brochures featuring Trump Towers , Trump Palaces , Trump Plazas , Trump Hotels and Trump Golf Clubs all over North America - correction , the World .
â€˜Iâ€ ™ ll get you a biography , too.â€ ™
Well , I mutter , Iâ€ ™ ve read several of your autobiographies and ...
â€˜Thisâ€ ™ ll be a little easier for you .
MEREDITH!â€ ™ Trump has what some of his employees refer to as an open - door policy ; its main function seems to be that he can shout at them through it .
â€˜Would you get me a biography please!â€ ™ Meredith McIver , one of the assistants who doubles as his ghost writer , scuttles in with a few sheets of paper , on which a company bio is printed in bold and written in similar fashion : â€˜A schoolboyâ€ ™ s dream ... a competitorâ€ ™ s challenge .
Donald J Trump is the very definition of the American success story .
In August 2006 , Mr Trump was voted by the staff and writers of Business Week as one of the Top 10 most competitive business people on the planet.â€ ™ â€˜Today , Iâ€ ™ m in all the papers , â€ ™ he says , confirming this spirit of competition .
â€˜You saw the amount of press ?
It was beyond belief - every major show , every everything .
You check me on the internet I guess , do you ?
What - does your machine explode?â€ ™ Read the full piece here : Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s chief adviser on veteranâ€ ™ s issues on Wednesday declared that Hillary Clinton â€œshould be put in the firing line and shot for treason , â€ � the most extreme statement yet during a Republican national convention that has made the Democratic nominee the partyâ€ ™ s top target .
Al Baldasaro , a New Hampshire state representative and a New Hampshire delegate at the convention , made the comments on The Kuhner Report , a Boston - area radio show hosted by Jeffrey T Kuhner , a radio personality who styles himself as â€œLiberalismâ€ ™ s Worst Nightmareâ€ � . â€œIâ€ ™ m a veteran that went to Desert Shield , Desert Storm ,
â€ �
Baldasoro said on Tuesday .
â€œIâ€ ™ m also a father who sent a son to war , to Iraq , as a Marine Corps helicopter avionics technician .
Hillary Clinton , to me , is the Jane Fonda of the Vietnam.â€ �
Baldasaro went on to call Clinton â€œa disgrace for the lies that she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi .
She dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting back up security .
Somethingâ€ ™ s wrong there .
â€œThis whole thing disgusts me , â€ � he concluded .
â€œHillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason.â€ � Reached by the Boston Globe , Baldasaro stood by his comments â€œwithout a doubtâ€ � .
â€œWhen you take classified information on a server that deals with where our State Department , special forces , CIA , whatever in other countries , thatâ€ ™ s a death sentence for those people if that information gets in the hands of other countries or the terrorists , â€ � Baldasaro said .
â€œAs far as Iâ€ ™ m concerned ,
thatâ€ ™ s information for the enemy .
In the military , shot , firing squad .
So I stand by what I said.â€
�
The comments , coming from a chief advisor for a signature issue of Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign , are far from the only incendiary remarks directed at the former secretary of state during the Republican National Convention , where Clinton has loomed large .
On Superior Avenue in downtown Cleveland , men hawking T - shirts reading â€œTrump
This
Bitch!â€ � and â€œHillary Sucks ,
But Not Like Monicaâ€ � have done brisk business .
The anti - Clinton fervor has often dominated the primetime stage of the convention itself .
During a highly charged speech on Tuesday night , New Jersey governor Chris Christie presided over arena - wide chants of â€œGuilty!â€ � and â€œLock her up!â€ � as the former federal prosecutor argued in a mock trial â€œthe case now , on the facts , against Hillary Clintonâ€ � .
Later that evening , former presidential candidate Ben Carson departed from his prepared remarks to imply that Clinton worshipped Satan .
â€œOne of her heroes , one of her mentors was Saul Alinsky ,
â€ �
Carson said , referring to the father of grassroots organizing whose book , Rules for Radicals , Clinton once cited in a college thesis .
In that book , Alinsky calls Lucifer â€œthe very first radicalâ€ � .
â€œAre we willing to elect someone as president who has as their role model somebody who acknowledges Lucifer?â€ � Carson said .
â€œThink about that.â€ �
The rock band Third Eye Blind antagonized a crowd of Republican National Convention attendees during a charity concert at Clevelandâ€ ™ s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Tuesday night .
During the Musicians on Call fundraiser , held to aid in bringing live and recorded music to patients in healthcare facilities , the singer Stephan Jenkins continually blasted the GOP by condemning Republican ideology ( according to Billboard , he said he â€œrepudiatesâ€
� what the party now stands for )
â€ “ and making remarks such as : â€œRaise your hand if you believe in science.â€ � Clips uploaded on to social media show Jenkins exclaiming to booing audience members : â€œYou can boo all you want , but Iâ€ ™ m the motherfucking artist up here.â€
�
The Musicians on Call event wasnâ€ ™ t officially affiliated with the RNC , but its sponsor , the Recording Industry Association of America , had emphasized in a press release that the gala was explicitly tied to the convention .
The actions of the group , best known for their 1990s alt - rock hit Semi - Charmed Life , donâ€ ™ t come as a huge surprise : four years ago , Jenkins penned a commentary piece for Huffington Post titled Why We Arenâ€ ™ t Playing at the RNC , in which he explained why his band didnâ€ ™ t accept an invitation to perform at a private party during the 2012 Republican convention because â€œthey are , in fact , a party dedicated to exclusionâ€ � .
â€œThe Republican party is on the wrong side of Lilly Ledbetter , fiscal responsibility , unions , civil rights , climate change , evolution , the Big Bang theory , stem cells , Medicare , and me , and
thatâ€ ™ s why we will let them be , in their government - funded event center , to sell their song and dance without me , â€ � he wrote .
A woman at the centre of sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump has spoken for the first time in detail about her personal experience with the billionaire tycoon who this week became the Republican nominee for president .
Jill Harth , a makeup artist , has stayed quiet for almost 20 years about the way Trump pursued her , and â€ “ according to a lawsuit she instigated â€
“ cornered her and groped her in his daughterâ€
™ s bedroom .
After Trump mounted his campaign for the White House , details emerged of the 1997 complaint , in which Harth accused him of â€œattempted â€˜rapeâ€ ™ â€ � .
She said she was quickly inundated with interview requests from major US television networks , but resolved not to speak about the events â€ “ until Trump publicly said in May that her claims were â€œmeritlessâ€ � and his daughter Ivanka gave an interview in which she said her father was â€œnot a groperâ€ � .
Harth , who feels she has been publicly branded a liar and believes her business has suffered because of her association with the allegations , decided to speak out about her experience with Trump because she wants an apology .
In an hour - long interview at the Guardianâ€ ™ s New York office on Tuesday , Harth said she stands by her charges against Trump , which run from low - grade sexual harassment to an episode her lawyers described in the lawsuit as â€œattempted â€˜rape.â€ ™ â€ �
She first met Trump in December 1992 at his offices in Trump Tower , where she and her then romantic partner , George Houraney , were making a business presentation .
The couple wanted to recruit Trump to back their American Dream festival , in which Harth oversaw a pin - up competition known as American Dream Calendar Girls .
Harth described that meeting as â€œthe highlight of our careerâ€ � .
But in other ways , it was something of a lowlight :
Trump took an interest in Harth immediately and began subjecting her to a steady string of unwanted sexual advances , detailed by Harth in her complaint .
There was the initial leering in that first December meeting in Trump Tower , and the inappropriate questions after her relationship status .
It continued the next night over dinner at the Plaza Hotelâ€ ™ s Oak Room ,
where at a dinner with beauty pageant contestants she alleges he groped her under the table .
It culminated in January 1993 , when Harth and Houraney were visiting his Florida mansion , Mar - a - Lago , to finalize and then celebrate the beauty pageant deal with a party .
After business concluded , Harth and Houraney were on tour of Mar - a - Lago along with a group of young pageant
contestants â€ “
Trump wanted to â€œsee the quality of the girls he was
sponsoringâ€ � , Harth recalled â€ “ when he pulled her aside into one of the childrenâ€ ™ s bedrooms .
â€œHe pushed me up against the wall , and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again , â€ �
Harth recalled , â€œand I had to physically say : â€˜What are you doing ?
Stop it.â€
™
It was a shocking thing to have him do this because he knew I was with George , he knew they were in the next room .
And how could he be doing this when Iâ€ ™ m there for business?â€
�
With the strains of the score to Air Force One playing in the background , as is his tradition , Donald Trump kept it short upon landing in Cleveland to be greeted by vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and his family .
Trump arrived yet again in Cleveland with a great fanfare , landing in his trip in his Trump helicopter on a grassy field adjacent to the Cleveland Browns stadium .
With a swarm of hundreds of journalists from across the world cataloguing the turn of every helicopter blade , Trump emerged from his chopper accompanied by press secretary Hope Hicks and his son - in - law Jared Kushner , whom sources tell the Guardian has been acting as a de facto campaign manager in recent weeks .
The Republican nominee was greeted by his running mate Mike Pence as well as four of Trumpâ€ ™ s five children .
His wife Melania , who has been subsumed in a plagiarism scandal over her speech to the convention on Monday , was absent .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re gon na win Ohio , weâ€ ™
re gon na make America great again ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI just want to introduce a man who has become a great friend of mine , a man who is going to make an unbelievable vice president of the United States , Mike Pence.â€
� Pence , taking the microphone , told Trump that â€œit is such an honor to join your family to welcome you to Cleveland.â€
� â€œI am convinced what begins in Cleveland will end in the White House !
Thank you , God bless you , and welcome to Cleveland!â€
�
Afterward , Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina , who has yet to endorse Trump , was there to watch and observe .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never been to one of these rallies before , â€ � said Sanford .
â€œArriving by helicopter with Air Force One blaring in the background is so at odds with my personal style in politics which is rather low key and anything Iâ€ ™ ve ever known and observed about politics in the state that Iâ€ ™ m from which is a bit less ostentatious in form .
So Iâ€ ™ m watching and learning.â€ �
In remarks to his supporters in Cleveland as Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s plane touched down across town , Texas senator Ted Cruz confessed to his now - lost delegates that he cried after losing the Indiana primary .
â€œI
wasnâ€
™ t gon na let those SOBs turn â€˜Lyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ ™ into â€˜Cryinâ€ ™ Ted , â€ ™ â€ �
Cruz said , of the nickname bestowed upon him by Trump during the divisive Republican presidential primary .
The anecdote is another nail in the coffin of the idea that Cruz , who has refused to endorse Trump after dropping out of the race on May 3 , will throw his support behind the Republican nominee at tonightâ€ ™ s primetime speech at the Republican National Convention .
Stand by ...
A thought occurs !
According to an ABC News survey , 77 % of female voters have an unfavourable view of Donald Trump .
Women at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , Ohio , explained to the Guardian why they support the partyâ€ ™ s presidential candidate :
Speaking to delegates who were originally loyal to his presidential campaign , Texas senator Ted Cruz thanks supporters in Cleveland for the â€œamazing journeyâ€ � of his unsuccessful presidential campaign .
â€œThis afternoon is really for one very simple purpose , and it is to say thank you to each and every one of you - thank you from the very , very bottom of our hearts , â€ �
Cruz said , as his wife Heidi stood nearby .
â€œMore than anything else , Heidi and I are filled with extraordinary grattitude and thankfullness , â€ � Cruz continued .
â€œWe have been part of an amazing journey and it has been the privilege of our lifetimes to stand with each and everyone of you fighting for our country.â€ �
â€œThe men and women gathered here today , you are patriots , you love this country , you love our constitution , you love our freedom , you love our children and you believe in tomorrow !
This campaign , I believe , was about a lot more than one campaign or one candidate - this was a movement , all across this country.â€ �
Cruz did not endorse Donald Trump , his partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee , in the remarks , and is not expected to do so in his remarks to the Republican National Convention tonight .
An interesting , depressing note from the New York Times :
The employee , Meredith McIver , who has worked on some of Mr. Trumpâ€ ™ s books , is the first person to publicly apologize for an error at any point during the Trump campaign .
White House press secretary Josh Earnest , when asked about the Melania Trump plagiarism scandal , and parlayed questions about Michelle
Obamaâ€ ™ s
feelings on her remarks being lifted by a first lady aspirant into hopes that Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s remarks will be favorably looked upon by all future first ladies .
â€œObviously , in 2008 Mrs. Obama spoke movingly in her own words about her life story , about her values , and she was warmly received by the crowd , â€ � Earnest said .
â€œShe got strong reviews from pundits and Iâ€ ™ m confident in the future , aspiring first ladies and potential first husbands would draw on the same kinds of sentiments to advocate for their spouse.â€ � â€œMrs .
Obama is obviously quite proud of the speech she gave in 2008 , and Iâ€ ™ m confident that sheâ€ ™ ll deliver another speech thatâ€ ™ s equal to the test next week.â€ � â€œI have not spoken to the president and first lady since that letter became public , so Iâ€ ™ m not sure if theyâ€ ™ re aware of it right now.â€ �
The election , and the womenâ€ ™ s speeches , provides the American people , â€œan opportunity to compare the values and the messages in both , â€ � parties , said Earnest .
â€œThe focus weâ€ ™ ve had has been on the substance of the speech and the fact that Mrs. Trump received such warm applause , and such a strong review of her speech , based on reflection of the same kinds of values that were included in Mrs. Obamaâ€ ™ s speech .
I think thatâ€ ™ s a reflection that the country has a lot of common ground.â€ �
The warm reception to both speeches , Earnest said , â€œbuttresses an argument [ the president ] has been making of late â€
“ that the country is not as divided as it might seem.â€
�
â€œAll news is good news , â€ � after all .
Compare and contrast Melania Trumpâ€
™ s remarks with those of Michelle Obama :
As Melania Trump once said ...
It would not be a Trump contest without excitement and drama .
An in - house staff writer for the Trump Organization has accepted responsibility for the three - day controversy over Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech at the Republican National Convention , in which the would - be first lady delivered remarks that had been lifted from Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2008 .
The story has derailed attempts by the Trump campaign to focus the convention in personalizing Donald Trump , the newly minted Republican presidential nominee , and has left political experts scratching their heads over campaign leadershipâ€ ™ s refusal to admit that the remarks were plagiarized .
â€œMeredith McIver , an in - house staff writer from the Trump Organization , has released a statement regarding Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech from July 18th , 2016 , at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , Ohio , â€ � a succinct statement from the Trump campaign stated .
In the statement , McIver says that she inadvertantly included the first ladyâ€ ™ s remarks in Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech , and that she feels â€œterrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps.â€ �
Here are McIverâ€
™ s remarks in full : My name is Meredith McIver and Iâ€ ™ m an in - house staff writer at the Trump Organization .
I am also a longtime friend and admirer of the Trump family .
In working with Melania Trump on her recent First Lady speech , we discussed many people who inspired her and messages she wanted to share with the American people .
A person she has always liked is Michelle Obama .
Over the phone , she read me some passages from Mrs. Obamaâ€ ™ s speech as examples .
I wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech .
I did not check Mrs.
Obamaâ€ ™ s speeches .
This was my mistake , and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps , as well as to Mrs. Obama .
No harm was meant .
Yesterday , I offered my resignation to Mr. Trump and the Trump family , but they rejected it .
Mr. Trump told me that people make innocent mistakes and that we learn and grow from these experiences .
I asked to put out this statement because I did not like seeing the way this was distracting from Mr. Trumpâ€ ™ s historic campaign for president and Melaniaâ€ ™ s beautiful message and presentation .
I apologize for the confusion and hysteria my mistake has caused .
Today , more than ever , I am honored to work for such a great family .
I personally admire the way Mr. Trump has handled the situation and I am grateful for his understanding .
Donald Trump , Jr. and former House speaker Newt Gingrich apparently ran into each other at the Westin Hotel in downtown Cleveland this morning , exchanging pleasantries before heading for their respective breakfasts .
â€œAll attention is good attention!â€ � has , after all , been a guiding principle of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign .
Trumpâ€ ™
s
tweets fly in the face of the best efforts by his campaign leadership to move past the issue of Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s convention speech , which contained verbatim repetitions of remarks made by first lady Michelle Obama at the Democratic National Convention in 2008 .
In an interview on CNNâ€ ™ s New Day , Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort defended the campaignâ€ ™ s handling of the plagiarism allegations , refusing to acknowledge accusations of plagiarism and putting forth â€œthe final wordâ€ � on the speech .
â€œIt was a speech that talked about her love of a country , how she immigrated here , the opportunities that America gave to her , how she came here and it talked about meeting a man named Donald Trump , who she fell in love with and raised a family with , and she wanted to talk to the American people about
, you know , those â€ “ those personal feelings and thoughts , â€ �
Manafort said .
â€œThe controversy that youâ€ ™ re talking about is not meaningful at all .
Sheâ€
™ s not a candidate for office .
She was expressing her personal feelings about her country and her husband and why heâ€ ™ s best for the United States .
And I agree with you , thatâ€ ™ s the final word.â€
�
Of course , when Trump is your candidate , he always gets the last word - because he tweets it .
When pressed , Manafort aggressively asked Cuomo to â€œmove onâ€
� from the plagiarism scandal .
â€œAs far as weâ€ ™ re concerned , there are similar words that were used , â€ � Manafort said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve said that .
But the feelings of those words and the commonalty of those words do not create a situation which we feel we have to agree with you .
You want to have that opinion , fine .
You want to talk about it for the next six months , Iâ€ ™ m not going to be here because Iâ€ ™ ve got other things
Iâ€ ™ ve got to talk about.â€ �
Donald Trump finally brought starpower to Cleveland .
It was just a mile away from the convention hall .
In a well - catered breakfast event this morning , both Caitlyn Jenner and former talk show host Montel Williams addressed an event held by the American Unity Fund , an organization of pro - LGBT rights Republicans .
Jenner told the crowd of donors , delegate and a handful of elected officials , â€œIt was easy to come out as trans - it was hard to come out as Republican.â€ �
The Olympic gold medalist told attendees , â€œI think our best hope to get back to conservative government with 18 enumerated powers is in Republican party.â€ �
She added , however , â€œI have to admit very disappointed in it over past 5 - 10 years .
I wonâ€ ™ t give up hope on it and thatâ€ ™ s why I stand on the Republican side.â€
�
The gathering happened in the aftermath of a somewhat contentious platform fight where those affiliated with the American Unity Fund who sought to remove anti - LGBT language from the platform lost vote after vote .
Jenner even admitted to the gathering that â€œthe Democratic Party does a better job when it comes to lgbt community trans community and Obama does very good from that standpoint , letting trans people serve openly in military.â€ � Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign reportedly offered the vice presidential slot to Ohio governor John Kasich , promising that he would be â€œthe most powerful vice president in history , â€ � only to have Kasich not only turn down the offer , but refuse to endorse Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential bid entirely .
According to a New York Times Magazine report on the hunt for Trumpâ€ ™ s running mate , Donald Trump , Jr. made the approach , telling a representative of Kasichâ€ ™ s that , as vice president , he would be in charge of both foreign and domestic policy , an expansion of the officeâ€ ™ s powers that borders on the unconstitutional .
When asked what would be left for President Trump to be in charge of , the candidateâ€ ™ s son casually responded , â€œMaking America great again.â€
� â€œWhy
so heavy - handed in trying to tie Hillary Clinton to Lucifer?â€
� is a question that could only arise in the aftermath of a speech by Dr. Ben Carson .
In an interview with CNNâ€ ™ s Chris Cuomo this morning , retired pediatric neurosurgeon and onetime presidential nominee Ben Carson justified linking Hillary Clinton to the Dark Lord in his convention speech last night , calling Clintonâ€ ™ s stances on same - sex marriage and abortion
â€œespoused by evil.â€ � â€œWhen
you look at the principles that are espoused by Christ , by Christianity , and you look at whatâ€ ™ s espoused by evil , and then you look at things like killing babies , you look at things like redefining marriage away from what the biblical definition is , I think that thereâ€ ™ s pretty good consistency there , â€ � Carson said .
Last night , Carson departed from his prepared remarks by mentioning the fact that Clinton once cited in her college thesis a book written by Saul Alinsky , in which the community organizer acknowledges Lucifer as â€œthe original radical , â€ � in Carsonâ€
™ s words .
â€œNow think about that , â€ � Carson continued .
â€œThis is our nation where our founding document , the Declaration of Independence , talks about certain inalienable rights that come from our creator ; a nation where our Pledge of Allegiance says we are one nation under God .
This is a nation where every coin in our pockets and every bill in our wallet says â€˜In God We Trust.â€ ™
So are we willing to elect someone as president who has as their role model somebody who acknowledges Lucifer?â€ �
In the interview with Cuomo , Carson doubled down on his remarks .
â€œIf
she believed that at that time - and now you look at her actions - you look at what she advocates , the killing of babies , the dissolution of the traditional family , all these kinds of things - those are pretty consistent , quite frankly , â€ � Carson said .
In the highly important film The Devil Wears Prada , loyal fashion editor Nigel ( played by Stanley Tucci ) is passed over for a major job at the James Holt atelier due to the machinations of his boss , fierce editrix Miranda Priestly .
When Priestlyâ€ ™ s bait - and - switch is revealed , Nigel is heard murmuring :
â€œWhen the time is right , sheâ€ ™ ll pay me back , â€ � his voice hollow with defeat .
So , too , did New Jersey governor Chris Christie loyally vow to continue campaigning for Donald Trump , even though the Republican nominee passed him over for a spot on the ticket despite an endorsement that dearly cost Christie back home .
His barn - burning speech last night , formatted as a criminal indictment of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton , was the most attention - grabbing speech of the convention so far - well , the most purposefully attention - grabbing , anyway .
And finally , Christieâ€ ™ s ship is coming in .
After Trump held a $ 25,000-per - plate fundraiser for the New Jersey Republican party , then held a subsequent fundraiser to pay off Christieâ€ ™ s presidential campaign debt , the New Jersey State Republican Committee has officially paid off its legal fees in relation to the George Washington Bridge lane - closing scandal , better known as â€œBridgegate.â€
�
The donations helped the state party pay off more than $ 425,000 in legal fees , although Christieâ€ ™ s term of service at Runway on the Trump campaign is ongoing .
In a morning press briefing , Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort told reporters that the Republican party is officially making the â€œpivot to the general electionâ€ � with the official nomination of Indiana governor Mike Pence as vice president .
â€œHe will be talking about his record a little bit and why his background fills the criteria that Mr. Trump put out three months ago , â€ �
Manafort said of Penceâ€ ™ s planned remarks .
â€œWe feel he helps us to accelerate the unification of the party in a real meaningful way .
We are confident that at the end of the night , the case will have been presented in such a way that tomorrow night ...
we will have laid the foundation for that.â€ � Republican National Convention chair Jeff Larson acknowledged that yesterdayâ€ ™ s official nomination of during yesterdayâ€ ™ s session , â€œwe nominated Donald J. Trump to be our 45th president of the United States ,
and I think it went flawlessly -
it was an open and transparent process that I thought was something that youâ€ ™ d look back a year ago and think ,
â€˜well , thatâ€ ™ s not gon na happen.â€ ™ â€ � Manafort , meanwhile , plowed ahead through the agenda of the final two days of the convention , which he described as â€œmore personalâ€
� than the â€œred - meatâ€ � offered by speakers during the first half of the convention .
â€œTonightâ€ ™ s theme is â€˜Make
America
First Again , â€ ™ â€ � Manafort said .
â€œThe goal tonight is to lay out some of the vision of the Trump - Pence campaign , and to define some of the problems the country faces because of the failed leadership of the Clinton - Obama administration.â€
�
Manafort called Eric Trumpâ€ ™ s anticipated speech â€œmore personalâ€ � than the speech given by Donald Trump , Jr. last night ,
â€œand
I think youâ€ ™ ll find an expansion in the understanding of the man as a result of Ericâ€ ™ s speech.â€ �
Asked about the tone of the convention - likely Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton was likened to Lucifer last night by Dr. Ben Carson , shortly after New Jersey governor Chris Christie led an arena - wide chant of â€œlock her up!â€ � - Manafort dismissed concerns that the RNC has become more anti - Clinton than pro - Trump .
â€œI think the tone of the convention is multiple tones - there is an anger among the delegates that is out there in America .
People are frustrated by the failed leadership , difficult economic times , â€ � Manafort said .
â€œThe tone that I saw was the joy in nominating the candidates for president and vice president who the delegation believes will be able to carry forward a new vision for America.â€
� Of the â€œlock
her
upâ€ � chant , Manafort said that the arrest and imprisonment of Clinton was likely what Christie was â€œprobably advocating for in his speech.â€ �
â€œThose arenâ€ ™ t Republican red - meat issues anymore , â€ � Manafort said .
â€œThe Republican fears of past conventions have merged into Americaâ€ ™ s fears ...
the angst is broader than just Republicans.â€ �
On Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s planned address to the RNC tonight , Manafort said that â€œHeâ€ ™ s still working on it.â€
�
â€œHeâ€ ™ ll talk about Hillary Clinton and the failures , how American can not afford to have Hillary Clinton , [ and ] I think heâ€ ™ ll give updates on how he feels about Mr. Trump that will be pleasing to the campaign.â€ �
Cruz has not yet endorsed Trump .
Ben Jacobs has a key update on the PokÃ © mon
Go front : As Utah waited to cast its vote during the roll call last night , Senator Mike Lee , a steadfast opponent of Donald Trump who has yet to endorse the nominee , held court while surrounded by a scrum of reporters .
Lee weighed in on every topic under the sun , including , most importantly , PokÃ © mon Go .
He was not a fan .
â€œThe bottom line is it is not a fun game , â€ �
Lee told the Guardian .
â€œThere is nothing about PokÃ
© mon
Go
I find enjoyable.â€
�
Lee then took out his phone to try to elaborate this theory but the GPS didnâ€ ™ t work on the packed convention floor .
Good morning , and welcome to the Guardianâ€ ™ s campaign live blog , coming at you live from Cleveland , Ohio , the site of the long - anticipated Republican national convention , now in its third day .
After a day of campaign crisis over apparently plagiarized primetime remarks delivered by his wife the night before , Donald Trump celebrated his official accession to the Republican presidential nomination last night .
A giant satellite image of the no - longer presumptive nominee was beamed into the arena , Oz - style , after Trump officially clinched the nomination .
â€œI am so proud to be your nominee for president of the United States , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œTogether we have received historic results , with the largest vote total in the history of the Republican party .
This is a movement and we have to go all the way.â€ �
But with another plagiarism scandal brewing over his sonâ€ ™ s speech to the RNC and apparent concerns about the vast swaths of empty seats in the Quicken Loans Arena mezzanine during primetime speeches , the campaign still has a long way to go to realize the much - ballyhooed â€œconvention
bumpâ€
� in polling that comes after what should be a candidateâ€ ™ s crowning achievement .
Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign is probably hoping to make a fresh start with the third dayâ€ ™ s program .
Todayâ€ ™ s theme : â€œMake America
First Againâ€ � , featuring a roster of speakers who focus on American exceptionalism .
Beginning at 7 pm EDT tonight , the primetime program speakers include radio host Laura Ingraham , former astronaut Eileen Collins , Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz of Florida and Texas , Florida attorney general Pam Bondi , Eric Trump , former House speaker Newt Gingrich and vice - presidential nominee Mike Pence .
Weâ€ ™ ll have more on the full roster of speakers as the day progresses , but before events kick off with a presser from Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort , hereâ€ ™ s the news you need to know from the campaign trail : Mob justice has become an unofficial plank of the Republican party , after a barnburning primetime speech by New Jersey governor and former federal prosecutor Chris Christie prompted the RNCâ€ ™ s attendees to stand and chant â€œLock her up !
Lock her up!â€ � in reference to Hillary Clinton .
â€œI welcome the opportunity to hold her accountable for her performance and her character
, â€ �
Christie told the crowd , before â€œprosecutingâ€ � Clinton on , among other things , her use of private email servers during her time as secretary of state .
Former Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole â€ “ the only former Republican nominee to attend the RNC this week â€ “ told Katie Couric that Trump needs to make inroads with Latino voters .
â€œI want him to go to New Mexico and meet with the governor and apologize for anything that may have been said â€ ¦
we need Latinos in our party , we need more women in the party , and Iâ€ ™ ve raised it with him over the phone that I felt this is something that never should have happened and ought to be taken care of , and I had the feeling that he was working on it.â€ �
Fox News chief Roger Ailes is in negotiations with Rupert Murdoch to quit as chairman and chief executive of Fox News following a string of allegations of sexual harassment from some the channelâ€ ™ s highest - profile female news anchors .

2016-07-21,"Ted Cruz returned full of hope to the national stage on Wednesday , seeking to recapture the limelight at the Republican national convention .
But a speech designed by the Texas senator to lay the groundwork for a future bid at the presidency quickly unraveled as the crowd met Cruz with resounding boos after he withheld his endorsement of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee .
Cruz , the runner - up in the 2016 Republican primary , had arrived onstage to a thunderous reception at the arena in Cleveland .
The senator , who clashed bitterly with Trump prior to suspending his presidential campaign in May , congratulated his former opponent for the first time on winning the partyâ€ ™ s nomination and appeared to extend an olive branch to Trumpâ€ ™ s supporters .
â€œLike you
, I want to see our principles prevail in November ,
â€ �
Cruz told the thousands gathered .
But the mood within the arena changed dramatically when Cruz , while delivering what sounded like the opening speech of a second presidential campaign , declined to make the case for Trumpâ€ ™ s election .
â€œPlease , donâ€
™ t stay home in November , â€ � he said .
â€œStand , and speak , and vote your conscience , vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.â€ � Factions of the audience had already grown impatient , drowning Cruz out with jeers and chants of â€œTrump !
Trump!â€ � as he spoke at length with an impassioned pitch for conservative values without making a single mention of the Republican nominee .
Cruz at first made light of the protests , telling the crowd : â€œI appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation.â€ �
It was a reference to his infamous skirmish with voters in Trumpâ€ ™ s home state , whom the senator had knocked during his campaign as holding â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � .
The crowd nonetheless appeared to be holding out hope for a last - minute change of heart , even as aides to Cruz had repeatedly cautioned he would not be endorsing Trump in his speech .
Cruz instead issued a lengthy rebuke of Barack Obama , criticizing the presidentâ€ ™ s record on domestic issues and foreign policy .
He also addressed the heightened tensions among Americans amid frayed race relations , before making an appeal for new leadership in broader terms .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not fighting for one particular candidate or one particular campaign , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œWe deserve leaders who stand for principle , unite us all behind shared values , cast aside anger for love .
That is the standard we should expect , from everybody.â€ �
But as it became clear Cruz would not be backing Trump , most of the crowd revolted and drowned out the final moments of his speech with boos that reverberated across the basketball arena .
Cruz put on a brave face , wrapping up his remarks and thanking the audience , but the damage had been done .
In the midst of the uproar , Heidi Cruz had to be escorted out by security due to fears for her safety .
As the convention broke for the night , Trump accused his former rival of failing to honor a pledge all the GOP candidates had made to support the eventual nominee : Republican officials told reporters the senatorâ€ ™ s speech was â€œclasslessâ€ � , while commentators observed they had never witnessed anything like before .
A moment intended to channel Ronald Reaganâ€ ™ s 1976 convention speech , when the former president revived his political career after failing to win the nomination in his first attempt , was dubbed as memorable for its brutal reaction in an election year already defined by grassroots anger .
Cruz reportedly rejected a last - ditch effort by advisers hoping to persuade the senator to endorse Trump while onstage .
The two men have shared a notoriously frosty rapport following a primary battle that grew uncharacteristically nasty , with Trump attacking the physical appearance of Cruzâ€ ™ s wife , Heidi Cruz , and even implicating his father in the assassination of former president John F Kennedy .
Cruz , on the final day of his campaign in May , let loose his feelings about Trump by assailing his opponent as â€œa pathological
liarâ€ � , â€œa
narcissistâ€ � and â€œutterly
immoralâ€ � .
He was preceded on Wednesday by Florida senator Marco Rubio , who issued an endorsement of Trump through a pre - taped video message that played like a campaign ad .
â€œAfter a long and spirited primary , the time for fighting each other is over , â€ � Rubio said .
In a stark turnaround , Rubio also offered full - throated support of Trump as the better candidate on issues such as national security , despite having maintained in recent months that he wouldnâ€ ™ t trust the real estate mogul with the nuclear codes .
Rubioâ€ ™ s absence from the convention was nonetheless notable , given his position as one of the Republican partyâ€ ™ s more prominent stars .
The senator , who is seeking re - election to the Senate , said he needed to focus on his campaign in Florida .
Rubio , like Cruz , is widely perceived as harboring ambitions to seek the presidency once more .
Neither Rubio or Cruz has ruled out a second presidential bid as early as 2020 .
Cruz may run regardless of who occupies the White House in four years , an official with the RNC told Yahoo News on Wednesday , predicting the first major challenge to an incumbent president since 1980 if the Texas senator were to stand in a primary against Trump .
Both senators remain keenly aware of the damage they risk inflicting upon their own image by aligning themselves too closely with Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial brand of politics .
But staring down the barrel at a fractured party , they have taken vastly different routes while picking up the pieces of their failed campaigns .
While Trumpâ€ ™ s long - term impact on the party remains unknown , many within the top brass have acknowledged they are bracing for a potentially devastating loss to Clinton in November .
On Wednesday , Cruz crystallized his view that the conservative movement will come to judge those who staked their beliefs on their support for Trump .
What will remain to be seen is whether he can deliver on his bet that he will come through to lead the party back to power in 2020 , or whether his ambition died in Cleveland ."
2016-07-21,"Jeff Roe , former campaign manager for Ted Cruz , has said there was never a chance that the Texas senator would endorse Donald Trump in his convention speech on Wednesday night .
â€œI think it was a great speech , â€ � he said during a panel debate organised by Politico .
â€œHeâ€ ™ d worked on it for maybe the last four or five days .
He had played counsel on the endorse or not endorse question for a lot of folks within the team , outside the team , donors and activists and friends and conservative movement types and heâ€ ™ s a very patient listener and he receives good feedback but it was never part of the consideration to endorse .
If it had been tied to the speaking engagement then he wouldnâ€ ™ t have spoken.â€ � Roe , who had offered to negotiate with the Trump camp , confirmed the accuracy of Trumpâ€ ™ s tweet saying that he had seen Cruzâ€ ™ s speech two hours in advance but let it go ahead .
He said â€œclearlyâ€ � the nominee was hoping for a last - minute change of mind .
If Cruz had been vetoed and barred from speaking , Roe added , â€œheâ€ ™ d be more of a martyr than he is todayâ€ � .
But he also said of Trumpâ€ ™ s team : â€œThey were professionals all the way through â€
¦
They played straight up .
Donald came out at the end to kind of wrap it up .
Itâ€ ™ s all good theatre .
Tedâ€
™ s very clear and very consistent and very precise in his belief that our party is based on something beyond personalities and so thatâ€ ™ s why heâ€ ™ s not there yet .
Thatâ€ ™ s not to say that he wonâ€ ™ t be there.â€ �
Despite the fallout on Thursday , Cruz has no regrets , Roe insisted .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s at peace in a remarkable way , not a consultantâ€ ™ s reaction way , because he knows he did the right thing .
He called his daughters .
His daughters were , â€˜Why are they booing?â€ ™ â€˜Sometimes itâ€ ™
s hard to do the right thing .
I did the right thing.â€ ™
So thatâ€ ™ s what itâ€ ™ s about for him.â€
�
Roe denied that there was a political upside for Cruz .
â€œSomeone would have to show it to me .
Itâ€ ™ s just too easy .
How many outs did he have ?
The outs that he had is not go , is to say I support the nominee , say I support some man for president whoâ€ ™ s 6 ft 2 in and from New York , just dance and say his or name or not .
Thatâ€ ™ s all political bullshit ...
I canâ€
™ t see the political expediency here.â€ �
He described it as a â€œraw political moment for the partyâ€ � but promised Cruz will not say negative things about the nominee .
Roe also told the audience about some text messages he received on his BlackBerry during the speech :
Heâ€ ™ s killing it
This is awesome
Did Ted Cruz really just say atheist ?
Did he really just say Muslim ?
Did he really just say gay or straight ?
Did he really just talk about freedom and state rights ?
Did he really just say Colorado ?
( Roe : which denotes pot smoking , by the way ) .
( Roe : And New York versus Iowa , that whole playbook . )
Did he really say all those things ?
Like where was this guy ?
â€œAnd then it was , â€˜Oh , that kind of sucksâ€ ™ .
And then the next one was , â€˜I canâ€
™ t believe he did it!â€ ™
That was the night of text messages.â€
�
Aware that it was a â€œTrump roomâ€ �
, Cruz tried to avoid teasers about an endorsement , Roe said .
In one version of the speech Cruzâ€ ™ s congratulations to Trump for winning the nomination came towards the end , but they opted for version in which it appeared at the start .
â€œI think we felt weâ€ ™ d maybe get a little bigger bang for the congratulations right out of the gate ...
That was intended to take the oxygen out of the room.â€ �
They had also considered a joke in which Cruz said : â€œI always intended to be here , I just had a different speaking order in mind ,
â€ �
but it didnâ€
™ t make the final cut ."
2016-07-21,"Ted Cruz pointedly and repeatedly refused to endorse Donald Trump on Thursday morning , saying that he was not â€œa servile puppy dogâ€ � .
Just hours after the Texas senator was loudly booed from the floor of the Republican convention when he did not embrace his partyâ€ ™ s nominee , Cruz faced an impassioned audience as he took questions from his stateâ€ ™ s delegation during a breakfast .
The runner - up in the Republican presidential primary expressed his wonderment that â€œrabidâ€ � Trump supporters would object to his statement that Americans should â€œvote their conscienceâ€ � .
The Texas senator insisted â€œin that speech last night I did not say a single negative word about Donald Trump and Iâ€ ™ ll tell you this morning and going forward I donâ€ ™ t intend to say negative things about Donald Trump.â€ � Some Texas delegates disagreed .
While Cruz received repeated standing ovations , he also was subject to constant heckles and one Texas delegate stood through the first few minutes of his speech by holding a hand - drawn sign saying â€œClinton Cruz 2020â€ � .
Cruz pushed back against audience members who brought the pledge that he and other Republican candidates had made to support the eventual GOP nominee , saying that that promise â€œwas abrogatedâ€ � when Trump attacked his family .
â€œI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and my father , â€ � he said .
â€œThat pledge is not a blanket commitment [ that ] if you go slander and attack Heidi
I am nonetheless going to come like a servile puppy dog and say thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.â€
�
The Texas senator added : â€œThis is not politics â€ ¦
Right and wrong matters.â€
�
During the primary , Trump had suggested that Cruzâ€ ™ s father Rafael was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy and tweeted unflattering pictures of Cruzâ€ ™ s
wife Heidi in the course of the campaign while also threatening to â€œspill
the beansâ€ � on her .
While many in the room on Thursday supported Cruzâ€ ™ s stand , others were deeply disappointed .
Bonnie Lugo of Houston thought that the Texas senator was â€œspeaking in hurt , bitterness and disappointment.â€ �
She noted that although â€œthings were said about his father and wife , he was in a campaign and thatâ€ ™ s
what campaignâ€ ™ s are aboutâ€ � .
Craig Harvey of Houston was even more angry .
He felt Cruz gave â€œa wasted speechâ€ � in the convention hall Wednesday night and again Thursday morning .
â€œThe same ego trip , no clear answers , â€ � Harvey said .
Cruz noted that he had specifically told Trump over the phone earlier this week that he would not endorse him and had submitted his speech for approval by the nomineeâ€ ™ s campaign .
Cruz only criticized Trump directly once in the midst of his ongoing Q&amp;A.
â€œLet me point out by the way : can anyone imagine our nominee standing in front of voters and taking questions like this?â€
�
Afterward , Cruz left quickly and the room erupted into chaos as those who agreed with Cruzâ€ ™ s stance argued fiercely with those who disagreed .
Shouts and recriminations went back and forth as Texas Republicans called each other traitors and cowards .
As Cruz left the stage , top Trump adviser Paul Manafort took shots at the Texas senator in a press conference held in a hotel just across the street .
â€œThe party is definitely more unified â€ “ there are a number of Cruz delegates who were on the floor today
â€ ¦ who disagree with what Mr Cruz said , â€ � Manafort said .
â€œWe think it became very clear to everybody that Donald Trump has been very magnanimous in his outreach program
â€
“
he invited all the presidential candidates who ranâ€ � to speak , and â€œeveryone did attend and , in his own way , endorse the ticket.â€ � â€œHe was the only speech in the convention that was poorly received by the body in the hall , â€ �
Manafort said of Cruz .
â€œThat was
Senator Cruzâ€ ™ s decision .
As far as the contract [ of party unity ] was concerned , he was the one in violation , not anybody else.â€ �"

Mike Pence was warmly received during another chaotic night at the Republican national convention in Cleveland .
But his debut was undermined by boos that greeted Texas senator Ted Cruz who refused to endorse Donald Trump in a speech , revealing the enduring cracks in Republican party unity .
â€œPlease ,
donâ€ ™ t stay home in November , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œStand , and speak , and vote your conscience , vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.â€ �
But Cruz was met with resounding boos after he withheld his endorsement , leaving the value of his display of party disunity uncertain .

2016-07-21,"Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again .
At least thatâ€ ™ s what it says on his baseball cap .
But after three days in Cleveland , itâ€ ™ s not clear he can make his own convention great again .
By this stage of an election , the disgruntled former rivals have normally reconciled themselves to their fate â€ “ and the party welcomes them back into the fold with cheers of relief .
But this is not a normal convention and Trump is not a normal nominee .
So when Ted Cruz took to the stage , we saw just how far the party has traveled since the bitter primaries : not very far at all .
When we last heard from Cruz , less than three months ago , the Texas senator held the reality TV star in something less than high regard .
â€œThis man is a pathological liar , â€ � he told reporters .
â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t know the difference between truth and lies .
He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth .
And in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook , his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.â€ �
That was before he called Trump â€œa
narcissistâ€ � and â€œutterly amoralâ€
� .
Oh yeah , and chronically insecure .
â€œEvery one of us knew bullies in elementary school , â€ �
Cruz continued .
â€œBullies donâ€ ™ t come from strength , bullies come from weakness .
Bullies come from a deep , yawning cavern of insecurity .
There is a reason Donald builds giant buildings and puts his name on them everywhere he goes.â€ �
For Trump , of course , that reason is : greatness .
â€œI want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night , â€ �
Cruz said in the most factual statement he could muster about his nominee .
It was also the only time Cruz managed to say Trumpâ€ ™ s name .
â€œLike
each of you
, I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November.â€ � Cruzâ€ ™ s autobiography was subtitled A Time for Truth and his campaign slogan was Conservative , Courageous , Consistent .
But the Trump delegates didnâ€ ™ t seem to appreciate those qualities in Cleveland .
As Cruz droned on about freedom and the constitution , they began chanting their nomineeâ€ ™ s name .
When he urged conservatives to vote their conscience , they heckled and booed him like he was a member of the much - loathed media .
â€œI appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation , â€ � Cruz deadpanned .
When he walked off stage , the senator turned in the darkness and delivered the kind of deep bow that oozed disdain for a convention that had cheered him wildly when he walked out just ten minutes earlier .
Trump , meanwhile , feigned indifference towards Cruzâ€ ™ s speech in a tweet .
â€œWow , Ted Cruz got booed off the stage , didnâ€ ™ t honor the pledge !
I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway .
No big deal!â€ �
As the Clinton diehards said in 2008 : party unity my ass .
Newt Gingrich , the former House speaker and failed veep candidate , later tried to defend Cruz by telling the Trumpistas ,
â€œyou misunderstood one
paragraphâ€ � .
But they understood Cruz only too well .
What they wanted was good old - fashioned mob justice for Hillary Clinton .
Sure enough , the vice - presidential nominee Mike Pence delivered enough red meat to feed several chants of Lock Her Up !
Thereâ€ ™ s
good reason to think this chant will become the de facto slogan for Trumpâ€ ™ s general election .
In place of Hope and Change , we now have Abandon Hope .
Marco Rubio didnâ€ ™ t perform much better than Cruz .
He once suggested Trump was a sweaty con man who was variously incontinent , impotent , a business failure and a coward .
â€œItâ€ ™ s time to pull his mask off so that people can see what weâ€ ™ re dealing with here , â€ � Rubio told one of his rallies in February .
â€œThis guy has bankrupt a casino .
How do you bankrupt a casino?â€ �
he asked back then .
A great question for another convention .
Instead , the Florida senator appeared on what looked suspiciously like a hostage video , testifying to the fact that Donald Trump was not Hillary Clinton on taxes and terrorism .
â€œAfter a long and spirited primary , the time for fighting each is over , â€ �
he said with a forced smile that suggested he didnâ€ ™ t quite agree to the terms of his release from captivity .
The tone on Wednesday night was set neither by Cruz nor Rubio , though , but by Floridaâ€ ™ s attorney general , Pam Bondi , who ejected words from her mouth like she was deporting undocumented immigrants .
â€œLock her up , â€ � she told the crowd after declaring Clinton a security risk .
â€œI love that.â€
�
In Trumpâ€ ™ s Republican party , the best protest may be the silent kind delivered by Eileen Collins , the first woman to command the Space Shuttle .
After arguing for a revival of Nasaâ€ ™ s manned space program , Collins somehow neglected to deliver the last two lines of her speech : â€œWe need leadership that will make America first again .
That leader is Donald Trump.â€ � Cleveland , we have a problem ."
2016-07-21,"The third day of the Republican national convention is over and done .
Hereâ€ ™ s a summary of what happened : Ted Cruz did not endorse Donald Trump in a speech to the convention , and he was lustily booed by a crowd that had cheered much of his speech to that point .
â€œPlease , donâ€
™ t stay home in November , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œStand , and speak , and vote your conscience , vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.â€
�
Then he stood and waved to thousands booing .
Newt Gingrich came out after Cruz and said the crowd has misunderstood , that what Cruz said was in effect an endorsement of Trump because Trump was the only candidate faithful to the constitution , see ?
A sense of deteriorating order in the arena was expanded by the flickering malfunctions of the Jumbotrons as Eric Trump attempted to follow Cruz .
Vice - presidential nominee Mike Pence won an enthusiastic , if not quite rapturous , reception for a smooth speech that framed the election efficiently thus :
â€œItâ€ ™ s change versus status
quo.â€ �
After Penceâ€ ™ s speech , the last of the evening and on the late side of things , Donald Trump came onstage to very strong cheering .
And mis - kissed his running mate : The big finale begins tomorrow just after 7 pm ET , with Donald Trump , preceded by daughter Ivanka .
Early in the night , conservative radio host Laura Ingraham threatened to steal the show with attacks on Hillary Clinton and the media and a call on Cruz ( not by name ) to endorse Trump .
Marco Rubio addressed the crowd by video before the Jumbotrons went out and said it was time to unify the party and get behind the nominee .
His pixels were cheered .
A Trump staffer released a statement inviting blame for the inclusion in Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech Monday of Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s words .
Trump said â€œwe all make mistakesâ€ � and declined to accept her resignation .
The secret service was investigating a Trump aide who said Hillary Clinton should be shot for treason .
The Trump campaign said the aide did not speak for Trump .
Cleveland officials said a flag burning that turned into a melee resulted in the arrest of 18 people , bringing total RNC - related arrests to 23 .
A woman at the centre of sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump has spoken for the first time in detail about her personal experience with the billionaire tycoon who this week became the Republican nominee for president ."
2016-07-21,"Efforts to reboot a chaotic Republican convention by introducing vice - presidential candidate Mike Pence to American voters were undermined on Wednesday by an angry clash between Donald Trump supporters and those of his former rival Ted Cruz .
Pence insisted the party was coming together as he took to the stage at the end of the night to formally accept the partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
â€œThis week , with this united party , in November I know we will elect Donald Trump , â€ �
he said .
â€œThis team is ready , our party is ready , â€ � he concluded .
â€œAnd when we elect Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States we will make America great again.â€
�
The Indiana governor struck a self - effacing tone , in stark contrast to that of his new boss .
â€œ[Trump ] is a man of style and charisma â€
¦
so I guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket
, â€ � he joked .
â€œFor those who donâ€ ™ t know me , which I guess is most of you ... , â€ � continued Pence , to laughter .
Chosen for his impeccable conservative credentials , Pence was intended to reassure party leaders anxious about the highly unusual Trump campaign style and he prompted periodic chants of â€œWe like Mike , we like Mikeâ€ � from a warm crowd .
Projecting a more mature and conventional style than many in the Trump team , Pence also prompted chuckles of laughter from the convention floor for the first time this week with a gentler tone than the Cleveland crowd has become used to .
But he continued the conventionâ€ ™ s spate of strong attacks on Democrats , calling Hillary Clinton â€œthe secretary of the status quoâ€ � .
â€œWhen Donald Trump becomes president of the United States , the change will be yuge , â€ �
he said , imitating Trumpâ€ ™ s distinctive pronunciation .
Yet once more , attempts to build unity among Republicans were marred by angry scenes on the convention floor , where delegates earlier tried to drown out a Cruz speech that failed to endorse the partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
Trumpâ€ ™ s former closest rival for the nomination riled large parts of the crowd by hinting that voters should back candidates lower down the ticket even if they could not bring themselves to support the presidential nominee .
â€œTo those listening , please ,
donâ€ ™ t stay home in November .
Stand , and speak , and vote your conscience
, â€ � said Cruz to boos and whistles .
As the final lines of his speech rolled onto the autocue next to an instruction to pause for applause , the Cleveland arena was filled instead with the sound of jeering Trump supporters and a sheepish - looking Cruz sped off stage .
Marco Rubio was also met with stony silence when he appeared above their heads on a giant video screen but did not once mention the name of his former rival and Republican nominee .
Newt Gingrich , who narrowly lost out to Pence in the race for the vice - presidential slot , attempted to put a positive spin on the ugly scenes , saying he was proud that Trump had allowed his opponents to speak .
â€œI think you misunderstood one paragraph , â€ � he added , attempting to explain away the previous clash .
â€œTed Cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who upholds the constitution .
In this contest there is only one candidate who has pledged to uphold the constitution .
So to paraphrase Ted Cruz , the only possible choice is to vote the Trump - Pence ticket.â€
�
On the floor , arguments and debates broke out about the senatorâ€ ™ s appeal to Republican votersâ€ ™ consciences .
Texas delegates seemed to gather in one corner to argue over wording and tried to apply Talmudic levels of interpretation .
Two elected officials , both of whom supported Cruz in the primary , got into a heated exchange about the speech while passing by .
State senator Jason Raspert of Arkansas thought it was time to support the nominee while state representative Justin Everett of Colorado expressed his disappointment that the Republican party was not nominating a candidate who represented its platform .
He added â€œthe party will remain but candidates will come and go .
If youâ€ ™ re a Christian and youâ€ ™ re going to vote on principles , you need to vote on principlesâ€ � .
Wes Brumot of Longview , Texas , a diehard Cruz supporter wearing a Cruz â€ ™ 16 shirt on the floor , said that while â€œItâ€ ™ s unfortunate that people booed at the end .
Itâ€ ™ s unfortunate
Mr. Trump walked down [ into the hall ] to try to upstage his speech
â€
¦
I donâ€
™ t take personally.â€
�
Brumot though said he still wasnâ€ ™ t sure if he would vote for Trump in November .
As the convention broke for the night , Trump accused his former rival of failing to honor a pledge all the GOP candidates had made to support the eventual nominee : It was again left to Trump family members , employees and business associates to try to rescue an increasingly unruly convention with more direct endorsements .
Eric Trump followed Cruz on stage and described his father as the â€œepitome of the American dreamâ€ � whose big achievement during the primary was to turn â€œtraditional debates into must - see TVâ€ � .
â€œWow .
Wow .
Wow , â€ �
he started , leaving observers briefly unclear whether he was referencing the extraordinary scenes that had just preceded him .
Apart from Pence , only Laura Ingraham , a radio host , succeeded in lifting the sprit of a flat third night , with yet more attacks on Clinton that prompted cries of â€œlock her up , lock her upâ€ � from the audience .
â€œHonour your pledge to support Donald Trump , â€ �
she urged Cruz .
Trump had arrived in Cleveland earlier that day with a great fanfare , landing in his Trump helicopter on a grassy field adjacent to the Cleveland Browns stadium .
With a swarm of hundreds of journalists from across the world cataloguing the turn of every helicopter blade , Trump emerged from his chopper accompanied by press secretary Hope Hicks and his son - in - law Jared Kushner , whom sources said has been acting as a de facto campaign manager in recent weeks .
The Republican nominee was greeted by Pence as well as four of Trumpâ€ ™ s five children .
His wife Melania , who has been mired in a plagiarism scandal over her speech to the convention on Monday , was absent .
Trump sought to draw a line under the controversy on Wednesday with the release of a statement admitting his wife had provided a campaign speechwriter with lines taken from Michelle Obama .
Trump than gave brief remarks while introducing Pence , saying : â€œLast time I get accused of speaking a little bit long
so this time I am going to speak a lot
short.â€
�
Pence then pledged that â€œwhat begins in Cleveland will end in the White House.â€
�
Afterward , Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina , who has yet to endorse Trump , was there to watch and observe .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never been to one of these rallies before , â€ � said Sanford .
â€œArriving by helicopter with Air Force One blaring in the background is so at odds with my personal style in politics which is rather low key and anything Iâ€ ™ ve ever known and observed about politics in the state that Iâ€ ™ m from which is a bit less ostentatious in form .
So Iâ€ ™ m watching and learning.â€ �"
2016-07-21,"While Ted Cruz was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention and Melania Trump continued to ward off accusations of plagiarism , the US first lady , Michelle Obama , injected some much - needed humour into US politics with the help of TV host James Corden .
Obama rocked out to Stevie Wonderâ€ ™ s Signed , Sealed , Delivered as well as Beyonceâ€ ™ s girl - power anthem Single Ladies for a special episode of Cordenâ€ ™ s sketch Carpool Karaoke .
â€œWe just dropped the mic , we were making honey in the beehive , we were making honey to put in our lemonade , â€ � Obama joked from the passenger seat of Cordenâ€ ™ s car .
During a tour of the White House , the pair were also joined by the rapper Missy Elliott for a rendition of This is For My Girls and later Elliottâ€ ™ s hit
Get Ur Freak On .
Inbetween songs Obama highlighted her
Let Girls Learn initiative , which aims to promote education for girls around the world .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re doing a really important trip to Liberia , Morocco and Spain , â€ �
she said .
â€œRight now
thereâ€ ™ s 62 million girls worldwide that arenâ€ ™ t in school for a variety of different reasons .
So much could be corrected in the world if girls were educated and had power over their lives .
â€œMy message to kids here is donâ€
™ t take your education for granted , because there are girls around the world who would die to get the education we have , they would do anything , they would move mountains to make it happen.â€
�
The first lady also revealed that this was only the second time in seven and a half years that she had been in the passenger seat of a car listening to music .
The last time was some months ago â€œwith my daughter , who learned to drive , and we rocked out with her â€ ¦
so this is a treatâ€ � .
Asked what she would miss the most about the White House , Obama responded : â€œThe people ; these are people you see every single day , they help you , they love you , thatâ€ ™ s going to be hard.â€ � Carpool Karaoke , a regular segment in Cordenâ€ ™ s Late Late Show , sees celebrities join him for light - hearted conversations and singalongs .
Previous guests have included Adele , Justin Bieber , One Direction , Elton John and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers ."
2016-07-21,"Donald Trump , the self - declared king of deal - makers , faces the toughest negotiation of his career on Thursday night when he arrives on stage in Cleveland to close the final night of a Republican party convention riven by discord and disharmony .
The booing of Texas senator Ted Cruz , who failed to endorse Trump in his speech on Wednesday night , exposed how even as the nominee tries to pull the party together , he presides over a house divided between true believers , reluctant fellow travellers and dissidents still refusing to accept his victory .
â€œIt makes me sick to my stomach , â€ � Stefani Williams , a Cruz delegate from Utah , said as she watched Trump formally clinch the nomination on Tuesday night .
â€œThis whole experience has been disgusting .
I have no desire to be involved in a process
thatâ€ ™ s rigged and where people bully you and give you death threats .
They are trying to force us to unify behind him but if he wants our support , heâ€ ™ s going to have to persuade us.â€
�
All week the convention has strived to maintain harmony around its anti - establishment nominee .
â€œWhat do you say that we unify this party at this crucial moment when unity is everything?â€ � the House speaker , Paul Ryan , asked on Tuesday .
He might not like the answer .
Guardian interviews with dozens of delegates from across America found cracks in the facade .
To be sure , a majority of those present expressed support for the nominee , some with the kind of intense enthusiasm that has followed Trump on the campaign trail all year .
Another segment were tepid , admitting that they would have to hold their nose in voting for the nominee but he was still preferable to Democrat Hillary Clinton .
Then there was a vociferous minority who vowed to follow their conscience and remain defiantly # NeverTrump to the bitter end .
Williams , from St George , Utah , a heavily Mormon state where Trump is deeply unpopular , said : â€œIâ€ ™ m shocked he would be our nominee .
He doesnâ€
™ t stand for anything I believe in .
His adultery , womanising , the way he treats women is disgusting .
There are a lot of conservatives who canâ€ ™ t vote for Trump in good conscience .
Itâ€ ™ s a lost cause .
I really donâ€
™ t think
heâ€
™ s going to win ; his campaign is inept and the majority of Republicans donâ€
™ t want him .
They think they can win without their base â€ “ conservatives.â€ �
She shudders at the prospect of Trump swaggering on the global stage .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a disaster .
Heâ€ ™ s a wild card .
You donâ€
™ t know what heâ€ ™ s going to do .
He has no principles .
Heâ€ ™ s a playboy entertainer and itâ€ ™ s shocking that the American people would choose him.â€ � Williams , a pregnant mother of five
, said she received a death threat when she first voiced opposition .
Then Trump ally Carl Paladino sent her an email warning : â€œYou should be hung for treason , Stefani .
There will not be a Republican party if you attempt to replace Trump .
Iâ€ ™ ll be in your face in Cleveland.â€
�
On Monday , Williams took part in a doomed effort by anti - Trump forces to challenge the nominating rules and disrupt his coronation .
The resulting chaos was a blow to hopes of healing the rift but was soon overshadowed by the row over plagiarism in Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech .
As Ryan was intimating , this lack of unity could be fatal in the upcoming election battle against Clinton , who faces a challenge of her own to bring Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ supporters into the fold .
Unfortunately for the GOP , Trump is one of the most divisive political figures in recent memory and the snub by Cruz illustrated the mountain he still has to climb .
Selena Coppa , a Cruz delegate from Washington , said after Cruzâ€ ™ s speech on Wednesday :
â€œYou canâ€ ™ t vote your conscience and vote for a bigot and proto - fascist.â€
�
She is now contemplating voting for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and said she would join any walkout during Trumpâ€ ™ s speech on Thursday .
Christopher Morrill , a Cruz delegate from Arizona , said : â€œTrump needs to reach out to us and mend this bridge or weâ€ ™
re done.â€ �
He denounced the booing of Cruz and deplored â€œthe level of disrespect thatâ€ ™ s occurred in this conventionâ€ � .
Trump will also struggle to persuade the likes of Kris Shafer , 28 , a businessman from Fort Worth , Texas , who this week was wearing a â€œChoose Cruzâ€ � T - shirt on the convention floor .
â€œHe embraces and promotes principles I do not believe fit the Republican party , â€ � he said .
â€œMy wife is Hispanic and to vilify so many people , to say theyâ€ ™ re stealing our jobs , to paint immigrants that way , is not what Republicans have stood for.â€ �
Shafer was particularly galled by a boast that Trump made in January when he told a rally he could stand in the middle of New Yorkâ€ ™ s Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody without losing voters .
â€œThis is not how a leader behaves , â€ �
he said .
â€œWould you want someone who claims to be able to shoot people in charge of your country ?
Very many of his statements are disgusting .
You can go through a collection of his most offensive tweets.â€ � Shafer , a former Cruz staffer , accused Trump of hypocrisy in his criticism of free trade , noting that Trumpâ€ ™ s own companies use foreign labour .
â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t care.â€
�
And he mocked Trumpâ€ ™ s promise to make Mexico pay for a border wall .
â€œIs
he going to invade?â€ � he asked .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t even imagine being a regular voter and having to choose between a guy whoâ€ ™ s a lunatic and a woman whoâ€ ™ s a horrible person in her own right , â€ � said Jarrod Atkinson , a delegate from Texas who supported Rand Paul in the primaries .
â€œEverything heâ€ ™ s said and done is not conservative or in support of the constitution , â€ � Atkinson said .
â€œHe was telling security to throw out people who were at his rallies because they disagreed with him .
I donâ€
™ t want somebody with that kind of mentality to have the power and authority that the president is entrusted with .
That doesnâ€ ™ t make sense to me.â€
�
He added : â€œI support Republicans up and down the ballot .
To me , this isnâ€ ™ t
just about whoâ€ ™ s the next president , itâ€ ™ s about how are we going to get people to share our conservative values .
And Donald Trump doesnâ€ ™ t represent Republicans and heâ€ ™ s not going to .
Heâ€ ™ s made it abundantly clear.â€ �
Over in the Virginia delegation , Bethany Bostron , 25 , a law student , agreed .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not a fan , â€ �
she said of Trump .
â€œHe does not accurately reflect conservative values and the Republican party is supposed to be the conservative party.â€
�
Referring to Trumpâ€ ™ s outlandish statements on the campaign trail , she added : â€œItâ€ ™ s a terrible way to represent our party .
He said some terrible things and it makes me question his integrity and fitness for office.â€ �
She admitted : â€œIt would be very difficult to vote for Donald Trump.â€ �
The same dilemma faces Brenda High , 63 , a bullying prevention specialist from Paslo , Washington .
â€œI think heâ€ ™ s a bully
and you can tell that the people who support him are harassing people a little bit ,
â€ � she said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s pretty outlandish .
I was leaning towards him until August 6 last year when he called Rosie Oâ€ ™ Donnell a â€˜fat pigâ€ ™ and I thought , heâ€ ™ s a rude , crude kind of guy .
Thatâ€ ™ s unacceptable.â€
�
Yet High , who had originally supported Cruz , will swallow her objections and vote for Trump .
â€œAs long as he has good people around him , itâ€ ™ ll be OK ,
â€ �
she said wryly .
Jessica Fernandez , at 31 years old Floridaâ€ ™ s youngest delegate , supported Marco Rubio in the primary but had now come around to backing Trump .
â€œSixty - six of the 67 counties in Florida voted for Trump .
I think itâ€ ™ s part of my duty as being a delegate to deliver my vote for Donald Trump .
I donâ€
™ t agree with him all the time , but I disagree with Hillary Clinton all the time.â€ �
She added : â€œI donâ€ ™ t always like his rhetoric and the way that he speaks , but then again that has been one of his greatest assets .
Heâ€ ™ s really connected with voters ; heâ€ ™ s motivated people to come out who have never voted before .
â€œI would have preferred for him to not use such harsh rhetoric , but I think itâ€ ™ s a tactic he uses to get attention and itâ€ ™ s really worked.â€ �
Others have hardened their resolve to show as much enthusiasm as they can muster .
Mindy McAlindon , 49 , a stay - at - home mother from Centerton , Arkansas , said : â€œI would love for it to be Ted Cruz but he didnâ€ ™ t win , fair and square .
Donald Trump has issues I can get behind , like immigration , and heâ€ ™ s a true capitalist .
No candidate is perfect but I think we can all get behind him when our other option is Hillary Clinton .
Iâ€ ™ m still for the team.â€ �
Nazly De La Hoya , 26 , a delegate from El Paso , Texas , initially backed Kentucky senator Rand Paul .
â€œHe [
Trump ] was not my first choice ; however , Iâ€ ™ m very against the corruption and lies that Hillaryâ€ ™ s been involved with ,
â€ �
she said during a rally in Clevelandâ€ ™ s Public Square .
â€œTrump is a better alternative because he is likely to get us into unnecessary conflicts around the world .
I think itâ€ ™ s great that he is ending the politically correct culture that we have in the United States.â€ � Beverly Gossage , 66 , a Cruz delegate from Kansas who described herself as a Tea Party grassroots activist , said : â€œWe have to be realistic , Donald Trump is our nominee .
He is our only hope to be able to defeat Hillary Clinton .
My advice to other Tea Party people , like me , is look at the frontman , but then look at the people heâ€ ™ s putting behind him , the policy people .
Those are good , strong Republicans who want to change things the way that we do .
â€œSo if you donâ€ ™ t like the front guy , just take your eyes off the front guy .
Heâ€ ™ s not a king , heâ€ ™ s not an emperor â€ “
we have a republic.â€ �
That sentiment was shared by Craig Dunn , party chairman in Howard County , Indiana , who earlier this year told an interviewer : â€œIf it came down to Satan and Donald Trump at the convention , I might consider supporting Donald Trump.â€ � Dunn , originally a supporter of Ohio governor John Kasich , said on Wednesday : â€œIf you might imagine , the Trump supporters didnâ€ ™ t appreciate that very well and I went through about two weeks of threatening calls , threats against my life , my profession and a little bit of everything else because there were some people back in that time who were a little bit extreme .
â€œSo if anybody had a reason to not support Donald Trump , to tell somebody , stay at home , stay away from the game , it would be me .
But our countryâ€ ™ s future , I believe , is far too important to let your personal prejudices get in the way.â€ �
A number of elected officials who supported candidates other than Trump have described their feelings about the convention in simple , plaintive terms : â€œIt is what it is.â€ �"
2016-07-21,"Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s incendiary rebuke of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on the stage in Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday evening seemingly transformed the home of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team into a gladiatorial colosseum , complete with screaming fans and enraged detractors .
But the greatest battle on the stage during the week of the Republican national convention may be for control of a different kind of stadium entirely : its PokÃ © mon Go gym .
The mobile phone game , which integrates the hunt for fictional cartoon monsters with real - world locations in which users can battle one anotherâ€ ™ s teams , has become hugely popular at the RNC , where cellphones are ubiquitous and the downtime can be lengthy and tedious .
( For the uninitiated , PokÃ © mon â€ “ or â€œpocket monstersâ€
�
â€ “ are a hugely resilient late-1990s cultural import from Japan that typically resemble real - world animals imbued with elemental powers .
Originally , there were a mere 150 PokÃ © mon , but the numbers have since swelled to 722 .
Put another way , there are more PokÃ
© mon than there are Democratic super delegates
â€ “ and theyâ€ ™ re much more powerful . )
At the time of this writing , the grand stage on the convention floor is held by BuffaloStar , a level-17 PokÃ
© mon trainer , and his Hypno , a PokÃ
© mon that looks like a psychokinetic Carl Paladino .
Like many of the non - PokÃ © mon visitors to Quicken Loans
Arena , the turnover of gym masters is brutally high .
( Despite numerous attempts to take the stage , my comparatively puny Pidgeot was forced from the convention floor with the speed and humiliation of a Rick Perry presidential campaign . )
Its popularity among journalists at the convention has been particularly pronounced .
There are three PokÃ © Stops ( check - in spots wherein trainers can obtain supplies ) at the Huntington Convention Center alone , each of which is almost constantly installed with a â€œlureâ€ � , which draws PokÃ © mon to the area .
In the vast scheduling gaps between speeches , votes and briefings , pairs of reporters are frequently seen roaming the vast convention center in search of rare PokÃ © mon .
One Fox News Channel producer , seen wandering in haphazard concentric circles in the lawn outside the convention center , said he was more excited for Clevelandâ€ ™ s PokÃ © mon offerings than the convention itself .
â€œDrowzees are like Pidgeys here , â€ � the producer , who declined to give his name out of minor embarrassment , said .
He was referring to a sleepy tapir - style PokÃ © mon and a near - ubiquitous pigeon - esque PokÃ © mon , respectively .
â€œMy girlfriend is so mad â€ “ Iâ€ ™ ve been sending her screenshots of my PokÃ
© dex every time I catch a new one.â€
�
The game isnâ€ ™ t popular with every RNC attendee , however .
As Utah waited to cast its vote during the roll call on Monday night , Senator Mike Lee , a steadfast opponent of Donald Trump who has yet to endorse the nominee , declared that he was not a fan .
â€œThe bottom line is , it is not a fun game , â€ �
Lee said .
â€œThere is nothing about PokÃ
© mon
Go
I find enjoyable.â€
�
Lee then took out his phone to try to elaborate on this theory , but the GPS didnâ€ ™ t work on the packed convention floor .
With the epic taxonomy of PokÃ © mon , some users have noticed that certain PokÃ © mon share more than passing resemblances to famous political figures .
An anti - Westboro Baptist church protester in Clevelandâ€ ™ s Public Square named Kris Steadman , noticing this reporterâ€ ™ s buffering PokÃ © mon Go screen , observed that â€œDonald Trumpâ€ ™ s hair looks like a sad Flareonâ€ � .
In my PokÃ © dex , a freshly caught Jynx , a PokÃ © mon with pouty lips and stringy blonde hair , is nicknamed â€œAnn Coulterâ€ � .
PokÃ © mon
Go , like the Republican national convention , is a masterwork of augmented reality .
The source of the gameâ€ ™ s rapid popularity
â€ “ two weeks after its launch , PokÃ © mon Go has more users than Twitter â€ “ is its incorporation of a real - world environment augmented by computer - generated gewgaws .
Some attendees of the RNC , spotted idly swiping their phones during keynote speeches , see the game as having political applications .
â€œThey should put rare PokÃ © mon in poor areas ,
â€ �
Jordan Brewer , a volunteer at the RNC from Mississippi , said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s social entrepreneurship !

2016-07-22,"Ten hours after officially becoming the Republican presidential nominee , Donald Trump predicted Ted Cruz would ultimately endorse him , but said : â€œIf he gives it I will not accept
it.â€ �
Ex - KKK David Duke to run for senate
Trump said Cruzâ€ ™ s non - endorsement of him at the GOP convention was
â€œdishonorableâ€ �
: â€œHonestly he may have ruined his political career , â€ � said Trump .
â€œI feel so bad.â€ � â€˜My party died last nightâ€ ™
Then Trump said that the National Enquirer deserved a Pulitzer and praised a cover story speciously identifying a man photographed with Lee Harvey Oswald as Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father .
A well - sourced report said Hillary Clinton was set to unveil her running mate and appear with him ( ? ) on Saturday , but at press time no such news had broken .
Instead Clinton tweeted about the â€œhorrific situation in Munichâ€ � .
While Clintonâ€ ™ s veep selection was still unknown , attention surged toward a top contender , Senator Tim Kaine , whose Wikipedia page was edited a whopping 124 times on Friday , in a previously indicative metric .
Early TV ratings data suggested that Trumpâ€ ™ s RNC acceptance speech did not set a viewership record for such events , as the Republican debates starring Trump this year have , Reuters reported .
The president rebutted Trumpâ€ ™ s dire Thursday speech , saying : â€œThe idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse â€ “ this vision of violence and chaos everywhere
â€
“ doesnâ€ ™ t
really jibe with the experience of most people.â€ �"
2016-07-23,"Whenever some seismic event in pop culture is going down â€ “ some celebrity feud or drama
is â€œbreaking the internetâ€ � â€ “
thereâ€
™ s always a contingent insisting that there are â€œmore important thingsâ€ � to care about than the entertainment story du jour .
If you are one of these folks , allow me the honor of telling you that youâ€ ™ re annoying , condescending and a self - important jackass .
You know , the Ted Cruz of everything outside of politics .
The same goes for those who feel compelled to announce that they â€œdonâ€ ™ t careâ€ � about whatever pop culture moment is happening at the time .
If I had a big batch of cookies â€ “ ideally , really stale ones
â€ “ Iâ€ ™
d throw it at them and encourage the group to eat their treats as slowly as possible so that they each can enjoy the attention theyâ€ ™ re so clearly seeking .
The first complaint â€ “
â€œthere are more important things to care aboutâ€ � â€ “ grates most on my nerves .
Itâ€ ™ s not like celebrity news fans are claiming that Taylor Swift v Kimye is the most seismic event in history .
If anyone says as much , they are probably headline writers at entertainment media sites using hyperbole to get the clicks that will keep them employed .
Also , in a year like 2016 , which is drowning in melancholy , violence and strife , maybe â€ “
just maybe â€ “
some of us need a break .
Some of us want to enjoy a bit of levity in these emotionally trying times .
If you are black and living in America , you are subject to constant reminders that those who look like you are unjustly dying at the hands of the state , typically without any consequences for their killers .
As if that werenâ€ ™ t enough , this year has also brought the death of legends like Prince and Bowie in addition to Donald J Trumpâ€ ™ s so - far - successful candidacy .
To that end , do some of us want to laugh at Kim Kardashian dragging Taylor Swift on a Sunday evening ?
Or cackle at Blac Chyna scoring one up on that entire family by locking down the only boy of the bunch ?
Or be entranced by whatever BeyoncÃ © is doing at any second of the day ?
Youâ€ ™ re
damn right we do .
We need that escapism badly .
And for those who claim , loudly and publicly , not to care about the internetâ€ ™ s latest boyfriend : why ?
Do you think that makes you special ?
It doesnâ€ ™ t .
Are you under the impression it makes you sound smarter than the rest of us ?
That is not the case .
What is your point in pointing out that you donâ€ ™ t care ?
Playing the role of spoiler or pedant or petulant child upset that they canâ€
™ t relate
isnâ€ ™ t a remotely interesting addition to the rollicking celebrity discussion .
Let people have their fun .
Allow people to dive into the silly and superficial for the sake of their own sanity or for the simple fact that â€ “ gasp â€ “ they actually care about culture .
If you donâ€ ™ t , put a star on your nose and run into a wall before you ever again feel compelled to announce your unsolicited disdain .
We donâ€ ™ t care that you donâ€ ™ t care .
Donâ€ ™ t distract us from the important things â€ “
those getting us through each grim day ."
2016-07-28,"The Republican party wants my liberal vote .
This was the most shocking wave to wash over my brain last week as I sat in the convention center in Cleveland .
It was more startling in its way than the storm of hate that I saw descend on former GOP hero Ted Cruz , stranger than the absence of almost all the partyâ€ ™ s recent standard - bearers , weirder than the police - state atmosphere that hovered over the streets of the city .
The Republicans were trying to win the support of people like me !
Not tactfully or convincingly or successfully , of course : they donâ€ ™ t know the language of liberalism and wouldnâ€ ™ t speak it if they did ; and most of the liberals I know will never be swayed anyway .
But they were trying nevertheless .
Donald Trumpâ€
™ s
many overtures to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders were just the beginning .
He also deliberately echoed the language of Franklin Roosevelt , he denounced â€œbig businessâ€ � ( not once but several times ) , and certain of his less bloodthirsty foreign policy proposals almost remind one of George McGovernâ€ ™ s campaign theme : â€œCome home ,
America.â€ � Ivanka Trump promised something that sounded like universal day care .
Peter Thiel denounced the culture wars as a fraud and a distraction .
The Republican platform was altered to include a plank calling for the breakup of big banks via the reinstatement of Glass - Steagall .
I didnâ€
™ t hear anyone talk about the need to bring â€œentitlementsâ€ � under control .
And most crucially , the partyâ€ ™ s maximum leader has adopted the left critique of â€œfree tradeâ€ � almost in its entirety , a critique that I have spent much of my adult life making .
It boggles my simple liberal mind .
The party of free trade and free markets now says it wants to break up Wall Street banks and toss Nafta to the winds .
The party of family values has nominated a thrice - married vulgarian who doesnâ€ ™ t seem threatened by gay people or concerned about the war over bathrooms .
The party of empire wants to withdraw from foreign entanglements .
Trump is not going to receive my vote , of course .
His bigotry , his racist statements about Mexicans , his attitude toward global warming , his love of authoritarianism , his hypocrisy , his ignorance , his untrustworthiness , and his years of predatory business practice all make such a thing impossible .
He frightens me every time he opens his mouth .
But thatâ€ ™ s not the point .
The question we need to ask is this : what are the consequences of the violent disruption Trump has visited on our delicately balanced political system ?
Look what he has done .
He has dynamited the free - trade consensus that dominated Washington for so many years , he has done it with force , and in the process he has made himself the choice of many millions of Americans who have watched their economic situation deteriorate and heard their concerns brushed off by the Thomas Friedmans and the Bill Clintons of the world .
Think about it this way .
For years , Republican orthodoxy on trade made possible endless Democratic sell - outs of working people , with the two - party consensus protecting the Dâ€ ™ s from any consequences .
They could ram Nafta through Congress , they could do trade deals with China , they could negotiate the Trans Pacific Partnership , they could attend their conferences at Davos and congratulate themselves for being so global and so enlightened , secure in the belief that the people whose livelihoods they had just ruined had â€œnowhere else to goâ€ � .
In other words , it was only possible for our liberal leaders to be what they are
â€ “ a tribe of sunny believers in globalization and its favored classes
â€ “ as long as the Republicans held down their left flank for them .
Democrats could only celebrate globalizationâ€ ™ s winners and scold its uneducated losers so long as there was no possibility that they might face a serious challenge on the matter from the other party in the system .
Well , today all that has changed .
The free - trade consensus lies in shards on the floor .
The old Republican party has been smashed by this man Trump .
It is a new political world out there .
How will Democrats react to this altered state of affairs ?
How will they present themselves to voters now that the bipolar system of the last four decades has exploded , now that they can no longer count on free - trading Republicans to make their own passion for globaloney seem acceptable ?
So far , Democrats are acting as though nothing has really changed .
In speech after speech at the Philadelphia convention they are denouncing Trump as though he was just an outrageous extension of the familiar conservative demonology , rather than an altogether different monster .
And Democratic leaders seem to be preparing to run exactly as they have always run .
Hillary Clinton is pivoting to the right just as other Democrats did before her because ... because , well , thatâ€ ™ s what Democrats always do .
Her first big move after securing her partyâ€ ™ s nomination was to choose Tim Kaine as her vice - presidential candidate â€ “ a man who voted for fast - tracking the Trans Pacific Partnership and a supporter of his stateâ€ ™ s right - to - work laws .
He is , as a recent headline proclaimed , â€œa Democrat Wall Street can likeâ€ � .
Appropriately enough , Wall Street personnel are reportedly flocking to the convention in Philadelphia , eager to be reunited with the party that , for a time during the primary season , seemed to be turning away from them .
Other accounts suggest that Hillary intends to reverse course on trade as soon as itâ€ ™ s possible to do so .
Do Democrats and their supporters even glimpse the danger in such moves ?
On the contrary : they seem to think it shows statesmanlike gravitas .
On Monday , Bill Scher wrote , of Hillary Clinton :
She tapped Sen Tim Kaine despite his support for the â€˜fast
trackâ€ ™ law designed to ease ratification of multinational trade agreements .
Sheâ€ ™ s reached out to anti - Trump Republican hawks by embracing the philosophy of American Exceptionalism , declaring that â€˜if America
doesnâ€
™ t lead , we leave a vacuum , and that will either cause chaos or other countries will rush in to fill the voidâ€ ™ .
Her aides told the New York Times earlier this month that her governing strategy would be squarely based on bipartisanship , the antithesis of Sandersâ€ ™ vision of steamrolling Congress via grassroots revolution .
Letâ€ ™ s see :
trade agreements , outreach to hawks , â€œbipartisanshipâ€ � , Wall Street .
All thatâ€ ™ s missing is a â€œGrand Bargainâ€
� otherwise itâ€ ™
s the exact same game plan as last time , and the time before that , and the time before that .
Democrats seem to be endlessly beguiled by the prospect of campaign of national unity , a coming - together of all the quality people and all the affluent people and all the right - thinking , credentialed , high - achieving people .
The middle class is crumbling , the country is seething with anger , and Hillary Clinton wants to chair a meeting of the executive committee of the righteous .
When Democrats sold out their own rank and file in the past it constituted betrayal , but at least it sometimes got them elected .
Specifically , the strategy succeeded back in the 1990s when Republicans were market purists and working people truly had â€œnowhere else to goâ€ � .
As our modern Clintonists of 2016 move instinctively to dismiss the concerns of working people , however , they should keep this in mind : those people may have finally found somewhere else to go ."
2016-09-23,"Mike Pence , on Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s endorsement of Donald Trump :
Ted Cruz is a leader of the conservative movement and one of the strongest defenders of the liberties enshrined in the Constitution .
I am truly grateful for his endorsement of our ticket and look forward to working with him to advance Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s agenda to make America great again .
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s support is a testament to the unity and excitement that we see every day on the campaign trail as this movement rallies behind our next president , Donald J. Trump .
In a statement posted to Facebook this afternoon , Texas senator Ted Cruz declared that â€œafter many months of careful consideration , of prayer and searching my own conscience , I have decided that on Election Day , I will vote for the Republican nominee , Donald Trump.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve made this decision for two reasons .
First , last year , I promised to support the Republican nominee .

â€œSecond , even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee , by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s why I have always been # NeverHillary.â€ �
Trump is , as always , magnanimous in victory : â€œI am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz .
We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent .
I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.â€ �

Barack Obama vetoed a bill that would have allowed the families of 9/11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia .
Obama cited the potential for the popular bipartisan bill to backfire against the US , its diplomats and military personnel .

Larry Sanders , the older brother of Democrat politician Bernie Sanders , is hoping to emulate his siblingâ€ ™ s success by standing for the Green party in David Cameronâ€ ™ s Oxfordshire seat .
Bernie Sanders gave Hillary Clinton an unexpectedly tough fight in the Democratic presidential primaries , riding a wave of idealism among a predominantly young voter base .
Now his brother Larry , 82 , a retired social worker and former Green partycouncillor , plans to attempt a similar feat for the Greens in the byelection for the rock - solid Conservative constituency of Witney .
It will be a tall order .
â€œIt
hasnâ€ ™ t always been the richest turf for the Green party , â€ � a party spokesman said .
To become MP for Witney , he would have to overturn Cameronâ€ ™ s 22,700-vote majority in a seat where the last Green candidate won just 5.1 % of the vote .
But as Sanders points out , he has branding on his side .
â€œBecause of Bernard , Iâ€ ™ ve become famous , and I will get more attention from the media , and thatâ€ ™ s to be used to get the Green partyâ€ ™ s policies across , â€ �
he told the Guardian .

In this clip , former The Apprentice contestant and current director of African - American outreach

John Dickerson asked House speaker Paul Ryan about Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s proposal to expand New Yorkâ€ ™ s controversial - and - since - retired â€œstop and friskâ€ � policy nationwide .
The speakerâ€ ™ s answer : Weâ€ ™ ll see .
â€œI think Chicago should make that decision , â€ � Ryan said .
â€œNew York made that decision and - and a lot of people in New York thought it was successful.â€
�
â€œI think you have to make sure that thereâ€ ™ s - there are reasonable suspicion standards , â€ � Ryan continued , when asked if it was a good idea .
â€œI think it has to be done the right way .
I think local police , in local communities , need to make those decisions .
You can talk to New Yorkers and talk to former mayors of New York who thought it worked well.â€ � â€œObviously , it can not be done along racial lines , along ethnic lines , â€ � Ryan said , apparently unfamiliar with how stop - and - frisk policies were found in 2013 to disproportionately target African American and Latino neighborhoods by a federal judge .
â€œItâ€ ™ s got to be done along security lines where those reasonable suspicion standards are met .
But again , I just donâ€ ™ t think thatâ€ ™ s something we should pass a law here to do .
Thatâ€ ™ s something that local communities have to decide how best to keep them safe.â€ �
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s
former communications director :
Glenn Beck is despondent : Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has released a statement in response to Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s late - breaking announcement that he plans to vote for Trump in the general election .
I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz .
We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent .
I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again .
In July , Trump said that he would not accept Cruzâ€ ™ s endorsement if he offered it :
Heâ€ ™ s fine .
I donâ€
™ t want his endorsement .
If he gives it , I will not accept it , just so you understand .
I will not accept it .
It wonâ€
™ t matter .
Honestly , he should have done it .
Because nobody cares .
And he would have been in better shape for four years from now .
I donâ€
™ t see him winning anyway , frankly .
But if he did , itâ€ ™ s fine .
Here was the scene in Cleveland , Ohio , at the Republican National Convention when Ted Cruz withheld his endorsement from Donald Trump in July : The mood within the arena changed dramatically when Cruz , while delivering what sounded like the opening speech of a second presidential campaign , declined to make the case for Trumpâ€ ™ s election .
â€œPlease , donâ€
™ t stay home in November , â€ � he said .
â€œStand , and speak , and vote your conscience , vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.â€ � Factions of the audience had already grown impatient , drowning Cruz out with jeers and chants of â€œTrump !
Trump!â€ � as he spoke at length with an impassioned pitch for conservative values without making a single mention of the Republican nominee .
Cruz at first made light of the protests , telling the crowd : â€œI appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation.â€ �
It was a reference to his infamous skirmish with voters in Trumpâ€ ™ s home state , whom the senator had knocked during his campaign as holding â€œNew York
valuesâ€ � .
The crowd nonetheless appeared to be holding out hope for a last - minute change of heart , even as aides to Cruz had repeatedly cautioned he would not be endorsing Trump in his speech .
Cruz instead issued a lengthy rebuke of Barack Obama , criticizing the presidentâ€ ™ s record on domestic issues and foreign policy .
He also addressed the heightened tensions among Americans amid frayed race relations , before making an appeal for new leadership in broader terms .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not fighting for one particular candidate or one particular campaign , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œWe deserve leaders who stand for principle , unite us all behind shared values , cast aside anger for love .
That is the standard we should expect , from everybody.â€ �
But as it became clear Cruz would not be backing Trump , most of the crowd revolted and drowned out the final moments of his speech with boos that reverberated across the basketball arena .
Cruz put on a brave face , wrapping up his remarks and thanking the audience , but the damage had been done .
In the midst of the uproar , Heidi Cruz had to be escorted out by security due to fears for her safety .
As the convention broke for the night , Trump accused his former rival of failing to honor a pledge all the GOP candidates had made to support the eventual nominee : This tweet was just retweeted by Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s official account : Donald Trump , in July : I donâ€ ™ t want his endorsement .
If he gives it , I will not accept it .
We could do this all day .

Texas senator Ted Cruz has announced in a Facebook post that â€œafter many months of careful consideration , of prayer and searching my own conscience , â€ � he will cast his vote in the upcoming presidential election for Donald Trump , the Republican nominee with whom Cruz was once engaged in a bitter , months - long battle for the partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
Cruzâ€ ™ s decision is the result of two considerations , according to the senator .
First , his longstanding pledge during the Republican presidential primary to support the eventual nominee - although he declined at the time to say that he would endorse Trump by name - and second , his distate for Hillary Clinton . â€œEven
though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee , by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable , â€ �
Cruz said in the post .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why I have always been # NeverHillary.â€ � Citing policy differences concerning the supreme court , Obamacare , fossil fuels , immigration , national security and â€œinternet freedomâ€ � - a reference to a United Nations agreement that enacts a long - term framework to protect the internet from control by a single government - as â€œvital issues where the candidatesâ€ ™ positions present a clear choice for the American people , â€ �
Cruz wrote in the post that â€œif Clinton wins , we know - with 100 % certainty - that she would deliver on her left - wing promises , with devastating results for our country.â€ � â€œOur country is in crisis , â€ � Cruz concluded , calling Clinton â€œmanifestly unfit to be president.â€ � â€œDonald Trump is the only thing standing in her way.â€ �
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs has more on Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™
s rumored upcoming endorsement of bitter rival Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential bid : Ted Cruz is likely to announce his support for Donald Trump in the coming days , a source familiar with the decision told the Guardian .
The source was not sure if the Texas senator will deliver an outright endorsement or a more tepid statement of support , but said Cruz would most likely go the â€œwhole hogâ€ � with an announcement first reported by the website Politico on Friday .
Cruz finished second to Trump in the Republican primary and then pointedly refused to endorse him in his speech to the partyâ€ ™ s convention in Cleveland in July .
The Texas senator was booed from the floor .
The next day , he insisted he was â€œnot a servile puppy dogâ€ � .
Cruz , a hardliner who played a lead role in the government shutdown of 2013 , has long warned that Trump is not a conservative but rather a big - government liberal .
Trump has repeatedly attacked Cruz , not just politically but personally .
In the course of the primary , he criticised Cruzâ€ ™ s wife , Heidi , for her looks and implied that the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s father was somehow involved in the assassination of President Kennedy .
In both instances , Cruz fired back .
US intelligence officers are examining whether Carter Page , an American businessman listed as a foreign policy adviser for Trump , met with a Vladimir Putin aide to discuss the upcoming US election and with other Kremlin officials to discuss lifting sanctions if Trump is elected president , reports Yahoo .
Page has oil and gas business interests in Russia , and members of Congress fear that his political discussions with Russian intelligence officials could undermine US policies .
Senate minority leader Harry Reid contacted the director of the FBI , asking for the bureau to examine the â€œsignificant and disturbing tiesâ€ � between the Trump campaign and the Russian government , including meetings between Page and high - ranked Kremlin officials , say Yahoo .
The news comes as two senior Democrats , Senator Dianne Feinstein , who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committe , and Representative Adam Schiff , who sits on the House Intelligence Committee , released a joint statement on how they believe Russian intelligence agencies are trying to influence the US election .
â€œBased on briefings we have received , we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election , â€ �
they said .
â€œAt the least , this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election ...
orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government , â€ � they said .
Many in the FBI believe that hacking of the Democratic National Convention emails just days before the DNC began was by Russia .
As Yahoo reports : US intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow â€ ” Igor Diveykin .
A former Russian security official , Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election , the Western intelligence source said .
Conservative blogger Eric Erickson had refused to back Trump , but it seems heâ€ ™ s found someone to support this election : independent Evan McMullin .
He writes on his site The Insurgent , calling McMullin the â€œsane alternativeâ€ � : The reality is Evan McMullinâ€ ™ s candidacy is a long shot .
His best shot is winning a few states to throw the race to the House of Representatives where , though he may not get the Presidency , he might ensure neither Trump nor Hillary get it .
To do this he would have to win a few blue states , which though difficult is not impossible .
Surprisingly , he is already beginning to register in polls in red states like Utah and purple states like Virginia .
Frankly , Evan McMullin may actually serve a more important role in 2016 .
Though he may not win , he might at least provide disaffected conservatives an excuse to show up and vote down ballot .
Saving the Senate and House of Representatives from the Democrats has to be a priority for conservatives , but many are so disgusted by 2016 that they will not even show up in November .
McMullin gives people a reason to show up .
He gives conservatives someone they can vote for without holding their nose .
He gives people someone to vote for instead of reconciling themselves to voting against someone .
McMullinâ€
™ s candidacy is not the lesser of an evil , but an alternative against evil .
For many , that will be enough .
A lot of people have been writing me , begging me to reconsider Donald Trump .
They think this is the last best chance to get this nation right .
They think we will turn a corner after which we can not turn back .
In truth , I have concluded we are already past the point of redemption when the best either party can do is offer up Clinton or Trump .
We are beyond the point of looking to five black robed masters to save us from ourselves when we put up either a Clinton or a Trump .
The seriousness and virtue of the voter is in the grave already and too many yearn for an idolized past that never existed in a future that is not theirs , but Godâ€ ™ s , to shape .
I am realistic that Evan McMullin has a limited change of winning .
But I am idealistic enough to hope for better than Clinton or Trump .
More rumors are swirling around that Ted Cruz will shortly endorse Donald Trump for president , with Politico reporting that â€œmultiple sources close to Cruzâ€ � say it is coming as early as today .
Cruz and Trump had a particularly brutal primary fight , with Trump insinuating that Cruzâ€ ™ s father was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy and that his wife was unattractive .
As Politico reports : It is unclear whether Cruz will say only that he is voting for the Republican nominee , as other lawmakers have done , or offer a more full - throated endorsement , but the idea of throwing any support to Trump is controversial within Cruzworld .
â€œIf he announces he endorses , it destroys his political brand , â€ � said someone who had worked for Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign .
A former Cruz backer , conservative radio host Steve Deace , is tweeting his disappointment at news that the Texas Senator may back the partyâ€ ™ s controversial nominee .
Trump confirmed his full SCOTUS wishlist , with a total of 21 names , including those heâ€ ™ d released back in May.

When asked about why he was hesitant to back him , the Republican from Utah said , â€œWe can get into the fact that he accused my best friendâ€ ™ s father of conspiring to kill JFK , â€ � Lee said , referring to conspiracy theories against Cruzâ€ ™ s father .
â€œWe can go through the fact that heâ€ ™ s made statements that some have identified correctly as religiously intolerant .
We can get into the fact that heâ€ ™ s wildly unpopular in my state , in part because my state consists of people who are members of a religious minority church .

Her refusal to acknowledge her poor judgment in using a private email server and mishandling classified information is troubling .
So is her lack of transparency .
We were critical of her 275-day streak without a press conference , which just ended this month .
And she should have removed herself from or restructured the Clinton Foundation after allegations arose that foreign entities were trading monetary donations for political influence and special access .
But our reservations about Clinton pale in comparison to our fears about Trump .
This editorial board has been consistent in its criticism of his policies and temperament beginning with the Republican primary .
Weâ€ ™ ve condemned his childish insults ; offensive remarks to women , Hispanics and African - Americans ; and the way he has played on many Americansâ€ ™ fears and prejudices to further himself politically .
Trump brands himself as an outsider untainted by special interests , but we see a man utterly corrupted by self - interest .
His narcissistic bid for the presidency is more about making himself great than America .
Trump tears our country and many of its people down with his words so that he can build himself up .
What else are we left to believe about a man who tells the American public that he alone can fix what ails us ?
The editorial board even filmed a Facebook Live video to discuss its endorsement .
Seems Gary Johnson , the Libertarian nominee , is doing his own debate prep .
In an interview with MSNBC , reporter Kasie Hunt asked Johnson about the debates , to which Johnson poked out his tongue and declared that he could act ridiculous and still do well because heâ€ ™ d be offering another option .
The founder of Oculus Rift is secretly funding a pro - Trump political organization aimed at created aggressive anti - Clinton internet memes and â€œshitpostingâ€ � about her , reports the Daily Beast .
Palmer Luckey , who sold his VR for $ 2 billion to Facebook in 2014 , is funding the group known as Nimble America .
He posted on Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s Reddit community about the group under a pseudonym , talking about the secret power billionaires can wield : â€œThe American Revolution was funded by wealthy individuals ...
The same has been true of many movements for freedom in history .
You canâ€ ™ t fight the American elite without serious firepower .
They will outspend you and destroy you by any and all means.â€

President Obama offered up some debate advice to Hillary Clinton in an interview with Good Morning America : Be yourself and explain what motivates you .
Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin - who recently sat down for a chat with the Guardian - is pushing hard for the internet vote .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s national security editor Spencer Ackerman spoke with Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign about her national security agenda .
A key priority of Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s proposed intelligence surge will be to kill or capture Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi , her campaign has told the Guardian .
During the past year , Clinton , the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee , has placed bolstering the vast US intelligence apparatus at the center of her national security agenda .
Days before the first presidential debate â€ “ and after the New York area escaped without mass casualties from multiple bombings
â€ “ her campaign has for the first time expanded on how her policies would work .
Since its 2015 inception , the â€œintelligence surgeâ€ � has evolved from an idea of expanding intelligence assets directed against the Islamic State and its adjuncts to a broader initiative with a significant domestic component , aimed at uncovering and preventing attacks directed or inspired by terrorist groups .
Much of it remains undefined .
Its challenge , say Clinton campaign advisers , is to match and thwart the way terrorism has transitioned from large - scale attacks directed by established terrorist groups to small - scale assaults by unconnected , self - radicalized perpetrators that are comparatively difficult to detect .
Overseas , the Clinton campaign discusses the intelligence surge in terms of accelerating a focus on the Middle East .
It seeks to expand intelligence sharing , particularly across European governments hindered by the lack of a continental intelligence infrastructure , concerning flows of jihadists , money and weapons .
And it will support an intensified hunt for Baghdadi expending â€œsignificant resourcesâ€ � , reminiscent of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s successful push to find and kill al - Qaida leader Osama bin Laden .
â€œShe really would put a concerted focus on that , really going after him in particular , â€ � said Laura Rosenberger , a senior Clinton foreign policy adviser and former state department and National Security Council official .

Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Humbling at Hofstra ?
Preparation for Mondayâ€ ™ s first presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York means a fairly quiet Friday , with no official events planned for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton .
Instead , itâ€ ™ s debate prep day .
For Clinton that means less mock debate and more conversations about how to handle the different forms of possible Trump attacks , with the motto of prepare , prepare , prepare , says Politico :
In the end , it might not be anything Clinton says that matters .
Many longtime aides credited the power of her reaction shot â€ “ a comically disapproving maternal glare honed from her years as a first lady enduring another long spiel by somebody else â€ “ as one of her most valuable weapons in communicating gravitas and strength in the face of Trumpâ€ ™ s expected insults .
Trumpâ€ ™ s technique is often to question the validity of the moderators and the event itself , say campaign reporters from NBC News : The GOP nominee has been fond of describing himself as a â€œcounter - puncher , â€ � but Trumpâ€ ™ s debate strategy during the primary seemed simply to keep punching at rivals while reiterating portions of his stump speech .
He sparred with nearly every Republican who he shared the stage with throughout the GOP primary process and mostly stayed away from specific policies in lieu of rhetorical red meat for his supporters .
And he was generous with his use of nicknames for his opponents :
â€œlow energyâ€
� Jeb Bush , â€œlyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � Cruz and â€œliddle Marcoâ€ � Rubio.â€ ™
The debate is a hot ticket .
NBCâ€ ™ s Today show says Chelsea Clinton will be there , but it is unknown if husband Bill will attend .
Team Trump will have wife Melania and all five kids in attendance .
And billionaire Mark Cuban , whoâ€ ™ s been engaging in Twitter rants against Trump , will also be there : LA Times endorses Clinton
In advance of Mondayâ€ ™ s debate ( or perhaps Facebookâ€ ™ s voter registration day today ) , the LA Times announced it would endorse Clinton in the upcoming election , calling Trumpâ€ ™ s ignorance of the issues â€œmanifestâ€
� :
The election of Hillary Clinton as the first female president of the United States would surely be as exhilarating as it is long overdue , a watershed moment in American history after centuries of discrimination against women .
But thatâ€ ™ s not the chief reason to vote for her .
She deserves Americaâ€ ™ s support because she is the overwhelmingly better candidate .
Against a Romney or a McCain , she would almost certainly be our choice .
Against Trump ?
The question answers itself .
Clintonâ€ ™ s new ad : Trump insults women The Clinton campaign released a new video today , similar to the â€œrole modelsâ€ � ad where children watched TV while Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s most heinous comments play .
But todayâ€ ™ s focus is on females , playing a collection of Trumpâ€ ™ s worst quotes about a womenâ€ ™ s physical appearance over footage of young women looking at themselves in the mirror .
â€œDoes she have a good body ?
No .
Does she have a fat [ ass ] , absolutely , â€ � says Trump , while a young pre - teen girl studies her body .
â€œDo you treat women with respect?â€ � asks an interviewer .
â€œAh ...
I canâ€
™ t say that either , â€ � replied Trump .
The latest Pew Research Center poll shows distaste for either Clinton or Trump is the most common reason for vote for the opposing candidate in this election .
Todayâ€ ™ s movements Democratic vice - presidential candidate Tim Kaine hosts a rally in Houston , Texas , while Chelsea Clinton kicks off a phone banking event in Flint , Michigan , a town still recovering from the lead poisoning water crisis , and holds a press availability with Flint mayor Karen Weaver .
Neither Mike Pence nor Trump are hosting events today , although Trump has a rally in Roanoke , Virginia tomorrow .

2016-09-23,"Ted Cruz has announced that he will vote for Donald Trump in the presidential election .
In a statement posted to Facebook on Friday , Cruz said : â€œAfter many months of careful consideration , of prayer and searching my own conscience , I have decided that on Election Day , I will vote for the Republican nominee , Donald Trump .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve made this decision for two reasons .
First , last year , I promised to support the Republican nominee .
And I intend to keep my word .
â€œSecond , even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee , by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s why I have always been
# NeverHillary.â€ � Donald Trump responded to the announcement .
â€œI am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz .
We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent .
I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.â€ �
But Cruz and Trump clashed repeatedly in the primary campaign .
An ardent conservative who played a lead role in the government shutdown of 2013 , Cruz warned that Trump was not a conservative but rather a big - government liberal .
Riding strong support among evangelical activists , Cruz propelled himself to victory in the Iowa caucuses and in 10 other states .
He eventually finished second .
Trump repeatedly attacked Cruz , not just politically but personally .
In the course of the primary , he criticised Cruzâ€ ™ s wife , Heidi , for her looks and implied that the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s father was somehow involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy .
In a dramatic press conference on the eve of the Indiana primary , Cruz called Trump a â€œserial philandererâ€ � , an â€œamoral pathological liarâ€ � and a â€œbraggadocious , arrogant buffoonâ€ � .
The senator dropped out less than 12 hours later , after a decisive defeat .
In Cleveland in July , Cruz addressed the Republican convention but pointedly refused to endorse Trump .
He was booed from the floor .
The next day , he said : â€œI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father .
â€œThat [ Republican party ] pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi , that Iâ€ ™ m going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say , â€˜Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.â€ ™ â€ �
In his statement on Friday , Cruz said : â€œThis election is unlike any other in our nationâ€ ™ s history .
Like many other voters , I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election .
â€œIn Cleveland , I urged voters , â€œplease , donâ€
™ t stay home in November .
Stand , and speak , and vote your conscience , vote for candidates up and down the ticket whom you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.â€ �
He then detailed the issues on which he had made his decision , including appointments to the supreme court , healthcare , immigration , energy policy , national security and internet freedom .
He concluded : â€œOur country is in crisis .
Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president , and her policies would harm millions of Americans .
And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way .
â€œA year ago , I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee , and I am honoring that commitment .
And if you donâ€ ™ t want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency , I encourage you to vote for him.â€
�
The debate over whether to endorse Trump had splintered the Cruz inner circle , his campaign manager , Jeff Roe , pushing for a move to back the nominee while longtime strategist Jason Johnson has urged the senator to stand against Trump on principle .
Some Republican operatives , while unfazed by Cruzâ€ ™ s reversal , questioned why the senator did not simply throw his support behind Trump at the convention if voting for the nominee was still on the table .
â€œThis is why what he did at the convention was so foolish , â€ � said Craig Robinson , a longtime Republican activist in Iowa and editor of TheIowaRepublican.com .
â€œTaking all the slings and arrows that he took at the convention hurt him , because here he is today saying Iâ€ ™ m going to vote for this guy .
He should have just said that back at the convention and everyone would have been better for it.â€
�
But he suggested Cruz was realizing that a Trump presidency is now more of a possibility , and the senator was probably thinking ahead as he seeks re - election to his seat in 2018 , when he could face a primary challenge from Mike McCaul , the chair of the House homeland security committee .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t want a sitting president willing to fundraise or campaign with a primary opponent down the road ,
â€ �
Robinson said .
Robinson added it would be difficult for Cruz to continue and fashion himself as the standard - bearer for principled conservatism .
â€œThe people that this is tough for are those real Cruz loyalists who were there from the beginning â€ “
maybe some of the people that worked for him â€ “ who said , â€˜Heâ€ ™ ll never compromise on his principles and heâ€ ™ ll never support someone like Donald Trump.â€ ™ â€œTed Cruz isnâ€ ™ t this unique character whoâ€ ™ s going to hold the line .
They all thought he was.â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s endorsement left the Ohio governor , John Kasich , and former Florida governor Jeb Bush as the most prominent Republican primary candidates still to refuse to back the nominee .
Others who have steadfastly refused to back Trump include two prominent senators , Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Jeff Flake of Arizona .
Bushâ€ ™ s father , President George HW Bush , was this week reported to have said he will vote for Hillary Clinton ."
2016-09-23,"Perhaps the highest - profile Republican holdout in Trumpâ€ ™ s march on Washington , senator and former candidate Ted Cruz , has searched his conscience and now supports Trump , he announced in a Facebook post .
Cruz endorses
Trump After many months of careful consideration , of prayer and searching my own conscience , I have decided that on Election Day , I will vote for the Republican nominee , Donald Trump ...
My conscience tells me I must do whatever I can to stop [ Hillary Clinton ] .

Senator Ted Cruz Sure ,
Trump insulted his wife and linked his dad to the JFK assassination .
Sure , Cruz called Trump a â€œpathological liarâ€ � and got booed off the convention stage for not endorsing the nominee .

I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again .

The Cincinnati Enquirer"
2016-09-24,"Ted Cruz refused on Saturday to say that Donald Trump is fit to be president , even as he defended his surprise endorsement a day earlier of a man he called a â€œpathological liarâ€ � during the bitter tussle for the Republican presidential nomination .
Speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Cruz said he forgave Trump for insults directed at him and his family and had been persuaded to fall in line by his belief that Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee , must not be allowed to enter the White House , where he fears she would appoint liberal supreme court justices and trample over the constitution .
â€œI talked with both Donald and [ his running - mate ]
Mike Pence yesterday , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œHe was very gracious , he said thank you for the support.â€ � â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to move on and put the past behind us , â€ � he added .
Still , Cruz gave no impression that his antipathy towards Trump , or opinion of his presidential qualifications , have changed much since the spring .
â€œI have been very clear that I have significant disagreements with him.â€ �
Making it clear
he feels Trump is merely his least unpalatable option on the ballot , the Texas senator did not retract his criticisms , but he declined to repeat them during an onstage interview with Evan Smith , chief executive of the Texas Tribune , at the University of Texas .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re in a general election , I donâ€
™ t think it is productive for me to criticise the Republican nominee today , â€ � he said .
â€œDo you consider Donald Trump to be fit to be president?â€ � Smith asked .
â€œI think we have one of two choices , â€ � Cruz said .
He then talked about how hard he had tried to win the primary , and said the electoral process has produced â€œeffectively a binary choiceâ€ � .
In May , after Trumpdenigrated Heidi Cruz , the senatorâ€ ™ s wife , and Trump claimed that Cruzâ€ ™ s father had a link to the assassination of John F Kennedy , Cruzâ€ ™ s finally unleashed an explicit condemnation of the businessman with whom he had feuded for months .
The Texas senator responded with a diatribe against Trump , calling him â€œutterly amoralâ€ � , a â€œpathological liarâ€ � , â€œkookyâ€ � , a â€œserial philandererâ€ � , a â€œbullyâ€ � , a â€œnarcissist at a level
I donâ€
™ t think this country has ever seenâ€ � and a â€œbraggadocious , arrogant buffoonâ€ � who risked plunging America â€œinto the abyssâ€ � .
Trump retorted on Twitter : â€œWow , Lyinâ€ ™ Ted Cruz really went wacko today .
Made all sorts of crazy charges .
Canâ€ ™ t function under pressure â€ “ not very presidential .
Sad!â€ � That night
, Cruz ended his campaign after Trump won the Indiana primary , a vote that effectively clinched the nomination .
In the months that followed , as other White House hopefuls and senior party figures got behind Trump , however reluctantly , Cruz declined to follow .
At the Republican National Convention in July , he urged his audience to â€œvote your conscienceâ€ � in a speech that drew boos and accusations of disloyalty .
Still , time appears to have bridged some of the rift , even if Cruz has found himself teetering on the edge of another abyss .
Cruz announced his about - turn on Facebook on Friday , writing that defeating Clinton was all - important .
After much soul - searching , he wrote , he would honour a pledge made last year to support whomever became the nominee .
â€œIn my view , by any measure Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s manifestly unfit to be president , â€ � Cruz said in Austin on Saturday .
â€œThe @SenTedCruz endorsement was a wonderful surprise .
I greatly appreciate his support !
We will have a tremendous victory on November 8th ,
â€ �
Trump tweeted on Saturday .
Only a few months earlier , in July , Trump said : â€œI donâ€ ™ t want his endorsement .
If he gives it , I will not accept it
â€
¦ nobody cares.â€
�
With his political future seemingly in question and Trumpâ€ ™ s improved showing in recent polls putting added pressure on him to back the GOP candidate , Cruz tried to justify his decision to the Texas crowd .
He argued he was being faithful to the partyâ€ ™ s choice and his conservative principles , even though he had previously made it clear he saw the two as incompatible .
That meant conveying that even though he still feels Trump is an imperfect candidate , he would at least be a better defender of the US constitution and conservative values than Clinton .
This delicate task â€ “ supporting Trump without praising him â€
“ required a verbal tightrope act , and Cruz often wobbled .
During a question and answer session , a Muslim woman asked what she could expect from a Trump presidency .
â€œThat is a question youâ€ ™ re going to have to ask yourself , â€ � Cruz said ,
to jeers from many in the audience , before he pivoted to a favourite topic , his belief that a strong leader is required to combat â€œterrorismâ€ � .
He was also asked how , with a wife and two daughters , he could support a misogynist .
â€œThatâ€
™ s a question I have wrestled with , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œAt the same time I want my daughters to have a country where they enjoy freedom of speech , where they enjoy rights under the bill of rights.â€ � Cruzâ€ ™ s move risks undermining his self - proclaimed stance as an uncompromising , principled conservative who is unafraid to break ranks .
RedState , an influential conservative website , described the news as â€œTEDMAGEDDONâ€ � .
Caleb Howe , the associate managing editor , wrote : â€œAll he has done is taken his only remaining dedicated fanbase , his hardcore supporters who make up an also large , though probably not half , segment of the # NeverTrump population , and utterly disappointed them.â€ �
Though the 45-year - old Cruz is said to be eyeing a second tilt at the White House in 2020 , after his non - endorsement in July there were indications of a dip in popularity in Texas that might lead to a stiff challenge in 2018 to retain his US senate seat .
â€œWhatever path I went down there were going to be people that were dismayed .
There was no option that wouldnâ€ ™ t result in people being deeply , deeply unhappy , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œI think a lot of folks saw me as the face of Never Trump .
I have never been Never Trump
, I have never said I would never support Donald Trump .
I have been Never
Hillary.â€ �
Another speaker at the Texas Tribune Festival , the Libertarian presidential candidate , Gary Johnson , said he was surprised by the volte - face .
â€œI thought he was a really principled guy and
this doesnâ€ ™ t sound all that principled , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œWhen he in a very principled way
said , â€˜Look
I said Iâ€ ™ m going to vote for whomever the nominee was , but I canâ€ ™ t vote for him because heâ€ ™ s a serial liar and he insulted my wifeâ€ ™ â€ ¦ to me that sounded pretty principled .
â€œThat heâ€ ™ s going to now vote for Trump ?
Sounds like thereâ€
™ s some calculation here on the future.â€
�
Not that Johnson â€ “ who is polling at about 9 % , below the number that would have qualified him to take part in Mondayâ€ ™ s first presidential debate
â€ “ sees much long - term hope for a party he believes is damaged by internal division and a failure to appeal to young people .
â€œI think the Republican party is done for , â€ � he said ."
2016-09-29,"Barack Obama has a â€œ0%â€
� chance of getting his nomination for ambassador to Cuba approved by Congress , according to the union representing US diplomats .
The president this week announced Jeffrey DeLaurentis as his choice to become the first American ambassador to Cuba in more than half a century , aiming to put the seal on his detente with the communist island nation .
But while Havana welcomed the move , Republican senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas have pledged to block any ambassador nomination , citing a lack of progress in democracy and human rights .
Asked to rate the chances of DeLaurentis being approved ,
Ã �
sgeir
SigfÃºsson , spokesman for the American Foreign Service Association , said : â€œI would say 0 % .
With Marco Rubio on the Senate foreign relations committee , itâ€ ™ s never going to happen.â€
�
Rubio and Cruz are both sons of Cuban immigrants .
â€œThey have sworn to do anything they can against the normalisation of relations , â€ �
SigfÃºsson added .
â€œHe might not even get a hearing.â€
�
It is therefore a seemingly futile gesture on Obamaâ€ ™ s part , SigfÃºsson said .
â€œThe president is exercising his right to be a late lame duck president trying to do everything he can .
Itâ€ ™ s symbolic .
He drove through the normalisation of relations and gets to claim heâ€ ™ s the one who did it.â€
�
The US and Cuba severed diplomatic ties in 1961 , deep in the cold war .
Obama and President RaÃºl Castro of Cuba made a surprise announcement in December 2014 that they had secretly agreed to restore diplomatic relations , including reopening embassies in each otherâ€ ™ s countries .
Obama made a historic visit in March , and commercial flights resumed last month .
Obama called the naming of an ambassador a â€œcommonsenseâ€ � step toward more productive relations and said DeLaurentis â€ “ currently the top diplomat at the US embassy in Havana â€ “ is the best person for the job .
â€œThere is no public servant better suited to improve our ability to engage the Cuban people and advance US interests in Cuba than Jeff , â€ � the president said in a statement .
â€œJeffâ€ ™ s leadership has been vital throughout the normalisation of relations between the United States and Cuba.â€ �
He added : â€œHaving an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests , and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government .
We only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador.â€ �
On Wednesday , Gustavo MachÃ­n , deputy director for US affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry , described the news as â€œwelcomeâ€ � but said he will use a bilateral commission meeting in Washington on Friday to push for more .
â€œThe Cuban delegation will point out the lack of advances in the economic , commercial sphere , â€ �
MachÃ­n said in Havana .
â€œWe consider the measures adopted by President Obamaâ€ ™ s administration are positive but still insufficient and limited.â€
�
Obama should also use his executive power to further narrow the trade embargo imposed on Cuba after its 1959 revolution , Machin said .
â€œIf the president could â€ ¦ allow investment in telecoms , why canâ€ ™ t
he authorise investments in other areas?â€ �
Cubaâ€ ™ s top diplomat in Washington , JosÃ © CabaÃ±as , was given the rank of ambassador last year .
But the battle over â€œour man in Havanaâ€ � is already under way .
Rubio said : â€œJust like releasing all terrorists from GuantÃ¡namo and sending US taxpayer dollars to the Iranian regime , rewarding the Castro government with a US ambassador is another last - ditch legacy project for the president that needs to be stopped .
â€œA US ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government , which is a dictatorial and closed regime .
This nomination should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people , and until longstanding concerns about the Cuban regimeâ€ ™ s theft of property and crimes against American citizens are addressed.â€ �
Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont , the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the state department and foreign operations , took a different view .
â€œ[DeLaurentis ] is a career diplomat who is universally respected by his peers , and by Democrats and Republicans in Congress , for his intellect , his integrity , and his thoughtfulness , â€ � he said .
â€œThe decision to resume diplomatic relations with Cuba has been widely supported , and the number of Americans traveling to Cuba is increasing dramatically .
We need an ambassador who knows Cuba , who is respected by the Cuban government , and who will stand up for US interests and values .
Jeff is that person .
The Cuban people have their ambassador in Washington .
The American people need their ambassador in Havana.â€ �
Since diplomatic relations were restored on 20 July last year , DeLaurentis has led negotiations with Cuba on issues including the billions of dollars in US claims against Cuba for properties that were confiscated during the revolution .
The Republican presidential candidate , Donald Trump , said earlier this month that , if elected , he would undo Obamaâ€ ™ s efforts at rapprochement unless Cuba permits religious freedoms and releases political prisoners .
After a logjam last year that left numerous would - be ambassadors in limbo , the situation has much improved with eight awaiting confirmation , of whom five are expected to be approved this week , according to SigfÃºsson ."
2016-10-11,"Donald Trump railed against his fellow Republicans on Twitter on Tuesday morning , after a week in which many in the party have deserted him following the release of a tape of him boasting about groping women .
The move came as prominent Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both reaffirmed that they were standing by the nominee .
Trump described his party â€ “ which he first joined in 1987 before several years as a Democrat and an independent â€ “ as disloyal and unable to win , while labeling the House speaker , Paul Ryan , the most senior Republican in Congress , â€œvery weak and ineffectiveâ€ � .
Ryan has been a vocal critic of Trumpâ€ ™ s and this week announced he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him , although he stopped short of formally unendorsing him .
Trumpâ€ ™ s outburst marked yet another sign of the growing divisions between the candidate and the rest of his party , and the candidateâ€ ™ s willingness to throw political prudence to the wind to attack any dissenter .
â€œIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to , â€ � he tweeted .
His tirade came days after dozens of elected Republicans abandoned Trump in the wake of leaked video where he bragged about groping women .
The backlash culminated in a conference call on Monday with House Republicans at which Ryan essentially cut Trump loose and seemed to acknowledge that Hillary Clinton would win the election .
Shortly after landing in San Antonio for a closed press fundraiser , Trump extended his attacks , railing against the 2008 GOP nominee , John McCain , for withdrawing his endorsement .
â€œThe very foul mouthed Sen John McCain begged for my support during his primary ( I gave , he won ) , then dropped me over locker room remarks!â€ � Trump tweeted .
McCain issued a statement that he was unable to even offer his partyâ€ ™ s nominee â€œconditional supportâ€ � on Saturday in the wake of what the Arizona senator called Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œboasts about sexual assaultsâ€ � .
Trump had previously mocked McCain , a decorated war hero , for being captured during the Vietnam war after his plane was shot down .
Rubio , who ran against Trump in the presidential primary , said his position had not changed in a statement on Tuesday after facing mounting pressure from his opponent in the Florida Senate race to dump Trump .
â€œI disagree with him on many things , but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI wish we had better choices for president .
But I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next president .
â€œWhile
I respect that voters chose him as the GOP nominee , I have never hesitated to oppose his policies I disagree with , â€ � he added of Trump .
â€œAnd I have consistently rejected his offensive rhetoric and behavior.â€ �
Rubio did not specifically address in his statement the tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women .
The senatorâ€ ™ s only remark on its content was a tweet late on Friday , in which he said
Trumpâ€ ™ s comments were â€œvulgar , egregious [ and ] impossible to justifyâ€ � .
The senator was trounced by his former rival by 20 points in the Florida primary , and needs Trumpâ€ ™ s base of support to be re - elected in his home state next month .
His statement came shortly after Ted Cruz , another 2016 contender expected to seek the presidency again , also reaffirmed his support for Trump .
â€œI am supporting the Republican nominee because I think Hillary Clinton is an absolute disaster , â€ �
Cruz said in an interview with a local Texas station .
â€œNow my differences with Donald , I have articulated at great length during the campaign , â€ � he added .
â€œThis is an election unlike any other but Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , Hillary Clinton , I think , is manifestly unfit to be president.â€ �
Trump attacked Ryan with his first tweet this morning , writing : â€œDespite winning the second debate in a landslide ( every poll ) , it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!â€ � and then continuing â€œour very weak and ineffective leader , Paul Ryan , had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyaltyâ€ � .
Polls conducted using more rigorous methodology â€ “ rather than the self - selecting online polls Trump has highlighted â€
“ have ruled that Clinton â€œwonâ€
� the second debate on Sunday night .
Trump then boasted that â€œthe shackles have been taken off meâ€ � before attacking fellow Republicans for perceived disloyalty .
A spokesperson for Ryan shrugged off the comments , saying in a statement : â€œPaul Ryan is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats , and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same.â€ �
However , Trumpâ€ ™ s criticisms come at a time of growing schism between the nomineeâ€ ™ s supporters and other Republicans .
Trump supporters rallied outside the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington on Monday in protest against what they saw as the national partyâ€ ™ s anti - Trump bias .
The protest was organized by the Trump campaignâ€ ™ s Virginia state chairman , who was fired for what the deputy campaign manager , David Bossie , called â€œa stunt in front of the RNC without the knowledge or the approval of the Trump campaignâ€ � .
Meanwhile Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson bragged on Twitter on Monday about the number of people who were voting for Trump but not voting for Republican candidates for the Senate and the House .
Earlier this year , while the primary process was still taking place , Trump renounced a pledge he had made to support the GOP nominee whoever he or she was because â€œI have been treated very unfairlyâ€ � .
Before his 2016 run for the White House , Trump , who most recently registered as a Republican in April 2012 , had donated to a number of Democratic politicians and flirted with a third - party campaign for the presidency in 2000 ."
2016-10-11,"Donald Trump railed against his fellow Republicans on Twitter on Tuesday morning , after a week in which many in the party have deserted him following the release of a tape of him boasting about groping women .
The move came as prominent Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both reaffirmed that they were standing by the nominee .
Trump described his party â€ “ which he first joined in 1987 before several years as a Democrat and an independent â€ “ as disloyal and unable to win , while labeling the House speaker , Paul Ryan , the most senior Republican in Congress , â€œvery weak and ineffectiveâ€ � .
Ryan has been a vocal critic of Trumpâ€ ™ s and this week announced he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him , although he stopped short of formally unendorsing him .
Barack Obama assailed Republican nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday over remarks about groping women , also criticizing Republicans who continued to support the candidate .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say thatâ€ ™ s not right , â€ � the president said in Greensboro , North Carolina , in his first public remarks since the release of a 2005 tape showing Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without their consent .
â€œYou just have to be a decent human being to say thatâ€ ™ s not right.â€ �
Hillary Clinton used the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on Tuesday , enlisting the help of her husbandâ€ ™ s former vice - president Al Gore to urge Americaâ€ ™ s voters not to risk sending a â€œclimate change denierâ€ � to the White House .
In a joint address in Miami , Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global warming is a hoax initiated by the Chinese .
â€œClimate change is real , itâ€ ™ s urgent , and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it , â€ � Clinton said , promising investment in clean energy .
The 2016 campaign has jumped the shark .
Specifically , the shark from Jaws .
In a conversation with Fox News host Megyn Kelly , former Arkansas governorMike Huckabee declared that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be rough around the edges , but when the chips are down , heâ€
™ s the person you can trust to save your life â€ “ not unlike Captain Quint in the film Jaws .
The repercussions were swift following last Fridayâ€ ™ s leak of the Access Hollywood tape , in which Donald Trump can be heard bragging about sexually assaulting women : House speaker Paul Ryan told fellow Republicans that he would no longer defend the partyâ€ ™ s nominee , while hordes of party members distanced themselves from Trumpâ€ ™ s comments with some â€ “ including Senator John McCain â€ “ even saying they could no longer vote for Trump .
Supposedly , things could get even worse for the Republican nominee .
Following the release of the footage by the Washington Post , Bill Pruitt , a producer on the first two seasons of The Apprentice , the NBC reality show Trump hosted from 2004 - 2015 , tweeted that there are â€œfar worseâ€ � behind - the - scenes tapes of Trump on the program .
Emmy award - winning producer Chris Nee has alleged that Trump says the n - word in the recordings .
The BeyHive did not take kindly to Trump surrogate Betsy McCaughey calling Hillary Clinton a hypocrite for criticizing Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s sexist remarks despite also being a fan of BeyoncÃ © .
â€œHillary Clinton expresses that she finds the language on that bus horrific , â€ � said McCaughey on CNN on Monday , noting that she herself did not like â€œrap musicâ€ � .
â€œBut in fact she likes language like this : â€˜I came to slay bitch , when he fuck me good ,
I take his ass to Red Lobster , â€ ™

Donald Trump , on Al Gore :
Didnâ€ ™ t he say he was the founder of the Internet ?
He wasnâ€ ™ t .
Live from Florida : Watch it live here : Texas congressman Blake Farenthold has swiftly apologized for telling an MSNBC anchor that he would have to think about revoking his endorsement of a candidate who said that he â€œreally liked raping women.â€ �
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign fired back on Tuesday as Wikileaks released a new tranche of hacked emails from the account of its chairman John Podesta , dubbing the website a â€œpropaganda arm of the Russian governmentâ€ � seeking to help elect Republican nominee Donald Trump .
The latest batch of more than 2,000 emails , disclosed on Monday , offered a glimpse into the inner workings of the Clinton campaign .
They included insights on multiple fronts , such as a lack of preparedness for Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ insurgent campaign , concerns raised by Chelsea Clinton over potential conflicts of interest for the familyâ€ ™ s foundation , and efforts by aides on how to best frame the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s second bid for the White House .
Last week , Wikileaks published other hacked emails from Podestaâ€ ™ s account , which included alleged excerpts of Clintonâ€ ™ s paid speeches to Wall Street .
Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign has neither confirmed nor denied authenticity of the emails , but in recent days escalated its charge that the hack was conducted by Russian state actors .
Brian Fallon , a spokesman for Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign , fired off a tweet storm late Monday in which he assailed Wikileaks and its founder , Julian Assange , for working on behalf of the Russian government .
â€œYou are no media organization , â€ �
Fallon tweeted at Wikileaks .
â€œYou are a propaganda arm of the Russian government , running interference for their pet candidate , Trump.â€ � Texas congressman Blake Farenthold , asked on MSNBC this evening whether he would continue to support Donald Trump if he said â€œI really like to rape women , â€ � did not commit to revoking his endorsement of the Republican presidential candidate .
â€œThat would be bad and Iâ€ ™
d consider it.â€ �
Donald Trump , making his first appearance in a one - on - one interview since the release of video recordings that showed him bragging about sexually assaulting women and since the second presidential debate , petulantly told Fox Newsâ€ ™ Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly that â€œI get along with everybodyâ€ � that that House speaker Paul Ryan had committed a craven act of political betrayal by refusing to defend him .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve been having a problem - we have millions and millions of followers , â€ �
Trump said ,
â€œand Paul Ryan , open borders and amnesty and bad budgets by the way , very , very bad budgets ...
The shackles are some of the establishment people the weak and ineffective people within the party.â€ � â€œTheyâ€ ™ re not giving support - they donâ€ ™ t give the kind of support , â€ �
Trump said , when Oâ€ ™ Reilly asked why he was so angry with Republican leadership .
â€œThey donâ€ ™ t give the support that we really need .
Maybe weâ€ ™ ll do better without their support.â€ �
When Oâ€ ™ Reilly asked if Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œthrowing off of the shacklesâ€ � of cooperating with Republicans meant that he would become more outspoken , Trump denied that he was outspoken at all .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think Iâ€ ™ m that outspoken to be honest with you - I think Iâ€ ™ ve been very nice , â€ � Trump said .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think so - look , I went to Ivy League schools.â€
� â€œIâ€ ™ m just tired of nonsupport - and I donâ€ ™ t really want support.â€ �
Asked how he would address his cratering support among women after release of video in which he grabbed about being able to â€œgrab [ women ] by the pussyâ€ � without consequence because of his fame , Trump dismissed the remarks as â€œlocker room talk.â€ � â€œMost people have heard it before , and Iâ€ ™ ve had a lot of women come up to me and say Iâ€ ™ ve heard that before , and Iâ€ ™ ve heard a lot worse , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œIf thatâ€ ™ s what it takes to lose an election
, I think thatâ€ ™ d be pretty sad.â€
� Oâ€ ™ Reilly said that his popularity among women has taken a hit , which Trump denied .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure I believe it - Iâ€ ™ m not sure I believe it , â€ � Trump said .
â€œWhat women want is they want secure borders , they want safety , they want law and order , they want a police department that is allowed to so its job , they want justice for all , â€ � before going on a tirade about Hillary Clinton creating Isis , which he said â€œIâ€ ™ m sure she was very proud
of.â€
� â€œTo be honest with you , Bill , I get along with people.â€ �
Hillary Clinton used the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on Tuesday , enlisting the help of her husbandâ€ ™ s former vice - president Al Gore to urge Americaâ€ ™ s voters not to risk sending a â€œclimate change denierâ€ � to the White House .
In a joint address in Miami , Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global warming is a hoax initiated by the Chinese .
â€œClimate change is real , itâ€ ™ s urgent , and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it , â€ � Clinton said , promising investment in clean energy .
â€œWe can transform our economy , we can rally the world to cut carbon pollutions and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect the planet .
Just remember what is at stake .
My opponent is a guy who denies science , who denies climate change every day.â€ �
Yet it was Gore , who lost the 2000 presidential election to George W Bush by less than 500 votes in Florida , who delivered the more powerful message about why the climate crisis is one of the most serious issues in this campaign , and why he believes Clinton is the only candidate who can help solve it .
President Barack Obama , on the stakes of the 2016 election : Civility is on the ballot !
Respect for women is on the ballot !
Tolerance is on the ballot !
Justice is on the ballot !
Equality is on the ballot !
Democracy is on the ballot !
If you want to send a message in this election , make it a resounding message !
Closing out his remarks by speaking directly to young voters , President Barack Obama urges them to turn out , despite the coarsening of the American political process during the 2016 campaign .
â€œThere are a lot of things about our politics that can seem cheap , and trivial , and frustrating , â€ � Obama says , â€œbut hereâ€ ™ s a chance to reject a divisive and mean - spirited politics that would just take us backwards .
And thereâ€ ™ s nothing cheap or trivial about that.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s real - that is true .
And young people , you have a chance to do that
, so donâ€ ™ t fall for the easy cynicism that says my vote doesnâ€ ™ t matter , or all politicians are the same ,
â€ � Obama continues .
â€œI promise you - your vote
matters!â€ � â€œIf you care about equality
, if you supported Bernie in the primaries , youâ€ ™ ve got a choice!â€ � Obama says .
â€œWhen he asks you what you have to lose , you answer - youâ€ ™ ve got everything to lose!â€ �
â€œSend a message for hope !
Send a message by voting for Hillary Clinton!â€ � Obama closes .
â€œSend a message about who we are as the American people , and make our kids proud!â€ � â€œLetâ€ ™ s get to work!â€ � President Barack Obama turns his attention to national security , often seen in polling at Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s strongest quality among voters , deriding the notion that Trump would be a safer commander - in - chief than Hillary Clinton .
â€œIf youâ€ ™
re concerned about whoâ€ ™ s gon na keep you and your family safe in a dangerous world
, the choice is even clearer , â€ � Obama says , and
â€œsheâ€ ™ ll do it without resorting to torture , or banning entire religions from our country.â€ � â€œHe might be up , I guess , at 3 am , but thatâ€ ™ s tweeting insults at someone who got under his skin instead of getting a good nightâ€ ™ s sleep to do the job of being president of the United States!â€ �
â€œCome on!â€ � Obama shouts , as the audience laughs .
â€œWhen , in the middle of a debate , you threaten to put your political opponent in jail - no trial , no indictment , no lawyers - when you welcome Russian meddling in our electoral process , then youâ€ ™ re disregarding not just things like facts or evidence or a free press , but youâ€ ™ re chipping away at core values like tolerance and due process and mutual respect , â€ � Obama says .
â€œAnd our democracy doesnâ€ ™ t work that way.â€ � â€œWe have stood in contrast and in opposition to those kids of ideas , and I frankly never thought Iâ€ ™ d see the day when we have a major - party candidate who would be promoting those kinds of notions!â€ � President Obama reacts to Alex Jones : He said me and Hillary are demons .
Said we smell like sulfur .
Ainâ€ ™ t that something ?
Now , I mean , come on , people !
Democracy does not work if you just say stuff like that !
President Barack Obama , on Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s age : At 55 , itâ€ ™ s hard for me to change
- I know at 70 itâ€ ™ s gon na be harder !
President Obama , extending an olive branch to Republicans who have been no fan of his administration for the past eight years , tells the audience in Greensboro , North Carolina , that not all Republicans ( # NotAllRepublicans ? ) say or believe the things that Donald Trump does - but that heâ€ ™ s a creation of their that they need to expressly disavow .
I do not believe that every Republican official thinks the way Donald Trump does - many of them do not .
The overwhelming majority of Republicans , they love the families , they love their country , theyâ€ ™ re good and decent people doing all sorts of good things for this country .
What is true is that over the last eight , ten , however long you wanna say , if youâ€ ™ ve been only about obstruction , if in order to score political points , you tell your voter base crazy stuff like I wasnâ€ ™ t born here , or
that Iâ€ ™ m a Muslim , or thatâ€
”
well , itâ€ ™ s just a long list .
â€œAnd you repeat it over and over again , and so that your only agenda is negative and you just make up facts , â€ � Obama continues , as call - and - response â€œYeahs!â€ � echo throughout the hall , â€œover time what happens is that you produce a nominee whoâ€ ™ s all about obstruction and insults and makes up his own facts !
Now , I donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s how the majority of Republicans think , but this is the habit you get into that
creates this kind of nominee .
And now you find a situation in which the guy says stuff that nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7/11 .
The fact that now youâ€ ™ ve got people saying , well , we strongly disapprove , we really disagree , we find those comments disgusting , but weâ€ ™ re still endorsing him , we still think he should be president , that doesnâ€ ™ t make sense to me !
Iâ€ ™ m certainly not perfect , nobodyâ€ ™ s perfect , and I too believe in forgiveness and redemption , but that doesnâ€ ™ t mean Iâ€ ™ m going to elect the person president !
â€œYou donâ€
™ t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say ,
â€˜Thatâ€ ™ s not right
, â€ ™ â€ � President Barack Obama says , of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks about sexually assaulting women .
â€œYou just have to be a decent human being to say , â€˜thatâ€ ™ s not right.â€ ™
And if it makes you mad , you can do something about it!â€ � â€œNobody fully understands - including me - the jobs and demands of this job until youâ€ ™ ve sat behind this desk ,
â€ � Obama continues .
â€œThe buck stops here !
And so , like , tweeting doesnâ€ ™ t qualify you .
Soundbites donâ€ ™ t qualify you .
Insults certainly donâ€ ™ t qualify you .
Nobody can fully know what itâ€ ™ s like to manage a global crisis , or know the feeling of sending a young person into war , but I tell you , nobodyâ€ ™ s been closer to those decisions than Hillary.â€ � â€œShe knows what it means , she knows what it takes , â€ � Obama continues .
â€œShe understands that the decisions you make in this job mean life or death , affect soldiers and veterans and workers who need a raise or a decent retirement .
She understands that it counts for families that are trying to climb into the middle class , or stay in the middle class.â€ � â€œNo matter how daunting the odds , or how many times she gets knocked down , she doesnâ€ ™ t point fingers or throw blame ,
she doesnâ€ ™ t
say the system is rigged
, she doesnâ€
™ t check her mic ,
â€ � he says , tapping the microphone .
â€œShe is qualified to be president of the United States of America.â€ � President Barack Obama , woke AF : You donâ€ ™ t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say ,
â€˜Thatâ€ ™ s not right.â€ ™
You just have to be a decent human being to say , â€˜thatâ€ ™ s not right.â€ ™ Speaking at a raucous rally in Greensboro , North Carolina , President Barack Obama outlines the progressive victories of the past eight years of his administration - and points to the threat to that agenda posed by the election of Donald Trump .
â€œI wanted to say thank you for all of the support youâ€ ™ ve given us over the years , â€ � Obama says .
â€œWhen we look back , eight years later , we fought back from the recession , our auto industry is setting new records , our businesses have turned job losses into 15 million new jobs ...
incomes are rising , poverty is falling , uninsured rate at an all - time low , across America you can marry whoever you love , brought our brave troops to our families , delivered justice to Osama bin Laden , shut down Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear weapons program , opened a new chapter with the people of Cuba ...
no wonder Iâ€ ™ ve gone grey , â€˜cause weâ€ ™ ve been busy !
Weâ€ ™ ve been busy!â€
�
â€œThatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ ve got all this grey hair !
Iâ€ ™ ve been busy!â€
�
Obama continues , the crowd eating it up .
â€œBut Michelle says I still look good.â€ �
â€œBut I am telling you , Greensboro , all that press goes out the window if we donâ€ ™ t make the right choice just four weeks from today .
The closer we get , the clearer the choice becomes , â€ � Obama continues .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got a choice right now between somebody who is as qualified as anybody who has ever run for the White House , and somebody who has proven over and over again that he is unfit to represent this county.â€ � â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t have the temperament or the knowledge or apparently the inclination to obtain the knowledgeâ€ � to serve as president , Obama says , â€œand that was before we knew about his attitudes towards women!â€
� Watch
it live here :
Former House speaker John Boehner has declared that while Donald Trump is â€œnot a conservative , heâ€ ™ s barely a Republican , â€ � he still plans to vote for him :
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s lead over Republican rival Donald Trump has widened to 8 points among likely voters less than a month before Election Day , according to a new Reuters / Ipsos poll that shows one in five Republicans hold the opinion that Trumpâ€ ™ s predatory remarks about sexually assaulting women disqualify him from holding office .
The survey , which was conducted after news of Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks to Access Hollywood in 2005 as well as after the second of three presidential debates between the two candidates , unhelpfully declines to include the specific percentages of likely voters supporting either candidate , other than stating that Clintonâ€ ™ s lead has extended from a 5-point lead the last time the survey was conducted .
( Thanks , guys ! )
According to voters who watched at least part of the second presidential debate , 53 % said that Clinton won , while only 32 % saw Trump as the winner - surely information that Trump will take into account the next time he tweets that every poll taken after the debate showed him winning by massive margins .
According to the poll , 42 % of American adults - and 19 % of Republicans - find that Trumpâ€ ™ s comments in 2005 , in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women and being able to get away with it by virtue of his fame , believe that Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks disqualify him from the presidency .
Hillary Clinton has wished her Jewish supporters an easy fast as Yom Kippur begins at sundown : Jake Tapper is about three more news cycles away from striking a panelist .
Breitbart News , the far - right website that has become a functional extension of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , reportedly merged certain editorial operations with the Republican nomineeâ€ ™ s presidential campaign a year before its executive chair joined the campaign as its CEO , according to a report from the Daily Beast .
â€œIâ€ ™ m Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign manager ,
â€ �
Steve Bannon , the current CEO of the Trump campaign and one of Trumpâ€ ™
s
closest advisors , wrote in an email sent on August 30 , 2015 to a former writing partner .
When asked if it was true , Bannon responded : â€œDonâ€ ™ t u ever read breitbart -- its trump central.â€
�
Bannon then lauded Trump as â€œa nationalist who embraces [ Sen. Jeff Sessionsâ€ ™ s ] immigration
planâ€ � as the reason the site became â€œTrump central.â€

The repercussions were swift following last Fridayâ€ ™ s leak of the Access Hollywood tape , in which Donald Trump can be heard bragging about sexually assaulting women : House speaker Paul Ryan told fellow Republicans that he would no longer defend the partyâ€ ™ s nominee , while hordes of party members distanced themselves from Trumpâ€ ™ s comments with some â€ “ including Senator John McCain â€ “ even saying they could no longer vote for Trump .
Supposedly , things could get even worse for the Republican nominee .
Following the release of the footage by the Washington Post , Bill Pruitt , a producer on the first two seasons of The Apprentice , the NBC reality show Trump hosted from 2004 - 2015 , tweeted that there are â€œfar worseâ€ � behind - the - scenes tapes of Trump on the program .
Emmy award - winning producer Chris Nee hasalleged that Trump says the n - word in the recordings .
In light of the allegations , Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer studios , which owns the rights to the show , and The Apprentice creator Mark Burnett are facing mounting pressure to make public the footage .
But on Monday , MGM and Burnett said in a joint statement to the Guardian , that they do â€œnot have the ability nor the rightâ€ � to release the material , citing â€œvarious contractual and legal requirementsâ€ � .
MGM and Burnett also refuted allegations that staffers have been threatened with legal action for releasing the outtakes , stating that : â€œthe recent claims that Mark Burnett has threatened anyone with litigation if they were to leak such material are completely and unequivocally false.â€ � Burnett â€œhas consistently supported Democratic campaignsâ€ � , the statement said .
In past presidential cycles , he has been a prominent donor to Democratic candidates and the Democratic National Committee .
But leaking The Apprentice tapes comes for an alleged asking price of $ 5.1 m â€ “ needed to cover the potential penalty fee for breaking Burnettâ€ ™ s non - disclosure agreement .
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign is officially using Kate McKinnonâ€ ™ s portrayal of the candidate as part of its communications strategy : The 2016 campaign has jumped the shark .
Specifically , the shark from Jaws .
In a conversation with Fox News host Megyn Kelly , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee declared that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be rough around the edges , but when the chips are down , heâ€
™ s the person you can trust to save your life - not unlike Captain Quint in the film Jaws .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s like Captain Quint in the original movie Jaws , â€ � said Huckabee .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s vulgar , heâ€
™ s
salty , he might even get drunk ...
But hold on here : heâ€
™ s the guy whoâ€ ™ s gon na save your butt and save your family .
And so , at the end of the day , when he kills the shark , youâ€ ™ re happy about it.â€ � Huckabee , who has long been a critic of American popular culture , continued with the analogy .
â€œNow , Hillary is the shark , â€ �
Huckabee said .
â€œSheâ€
™ s going to eat your boat , sheâ€ ™ s gon na have open borders , immigration out the kazoo , and so the choice is , do you vote for Captain Quint , whoâ€ ™ s gon na save your family , or do you vote for the shark ?
Thatâ€ ™ s the choice you get to make.â€
� Kelly , clearly a scholar of summer blockbusters , burst Huckabeeâ€ ™ s bubble by reminding the former governor that Quint was devoured by the shark .
â€œNow , governor , I hate to be the one to tell you this , â€ � said Kelly .
â€œCaptain Quint got eaten by the shark.â€ �
â€œBut he died saving the other people!â€ � Huckabee protested , laughing .
â€œBut he died!â€ � Kelly said .
â€œWent down in flames and the shark won as between the two of them!â€ � Huckabee continued , despite the blow to his theory .
â€œThe shark didnâ€ ™ t win !
The shark got blown up !
Look , any analogy can fall apart , Megyn , â€ �
Huckabee said , laughing .
â€œCome on , work with me!â€ �
Kelly rounded out the segment by singing Quintâ€ ™ s song from the film , Fairwell And Adieu to You Fair Spanish Ladies , because this campaign needs at least a little levity .
Actor Richard Dreyfuss , who starred as Hooper , the dreamy oceonographer , in the film , backed up Kellyâ€ ™ s assertion on Twitter :
Former vice president Al Gore reminds the audience in Miami that he knows better than anyone the importance of a vote in Florida - and encourages them to not let that opportunity go to waste .
â€œThe stakes in this election simply could not be higher , â€ � Gore says .
â€œHonestly , to those of you here and to those who can hear my voice by whatever means , this election really matters .
The world is on the cusp of either building on the progress of solving the climate crisis , or stepping back , washing our hands of americas traditional role of a leader in the world ...
the choice is that clear .
Itâ€ ™ s that stark.â€
�
Pounding the lectern , Gore reminds the audience of his 500-odd vote loss in the 2000 presidential election that ended up delivering the presidency to Republican rival George W. Bush .
â€œPlease take it from me - every single vote counts !
Every single vote counts!â€ � Gore shouts .
â€œIf you are not registered to vote , do so today !
If you are on the fence about whether to vote , remember what is at stake in this election , and if you think your vote does not matter , take it from me : your vote can make all of the difference in this election !
Vote early !
And donâ€ ™ t let your friends sit this election out.â€ � Returning to the main theme of the event - climate change , Gore lauds Hillary Clinton as a leader â€œwho gets it , who cares about it , whoâ€ ™ s internalized it , whoâ€ ™ s passionate about it.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s why I am here and thatâ€ ™ s why I will vote for Hillary Clinton!â€ �
Gore says .
â€œI know that my vote counts , I know that your vote counts , I hope you will consider carefully the future in making your decision this November.â€ � â€œTogether , we have the opportunity to look back on this year as a time when our national finally chose to answer the alarm bells on the climate crisis , and went into action to solve it .
I know that there are still some who doubt in their hearts that we as human beings and we as Americans have the ability to bring about such a big and important change ...
the will to change and build a brighter future is itself a reusable resource!â€ �
The last line of Goreâ€ ™ s speech is wildly popular - not least of all , with Clinton herself .
â€œThatâ€
™ s a great line
- I love that!â€ � Clinton shouts .
Al Gore , speaking to a slightly listless crowd in Miami , is lauding Hillary Clinton as the candidate who will help turn the United States into a â€œrenewable - energy superpower.â€ �
â€œThe Paris Agreement is a big deal , â€ � Gore elaborates .
â€œIt is by far the biggest step forward the world has ever taken to solve the climate crisis .
Every nation in the world , virtually ... agreed to phase out these greenhouse - gas emissions and go to net - zero emissions in the second half of this century.â€ �
â€œThe question in this election , â€ �
Gore continues , â€œis which of these candidates is going to continue this progress .
With Hillary Clinton weâ€ ™ ll build under the progress made by President Obama , and she will seize the opportunities.â€ � â€œItâ€ ™ s already creating millions of jobs , and it continues to get cheaper and cheaper every single week - world records are being broken.â€ � Al Gore , speaking in Miami , warns the audience that the warming of the Atlantic Ocean presents a clear and present danger to the state of Florida - and its residents .
â€œJust in the last year , we have seen one - in - a - thousand - year downpours , â€ �
Gore says .
â€œThis is not normal - it is becoming the new normal , which is now a set of conditions that we have created with all of this man - made global warming pollution.â€ � â€œEvery vertical inch of sea - level rise means four - to - eight feet of water going inwardâ€
� during storm surges and high tides , Gore continues .
â€œJust yesterday , there were six more cases of Zika in Dade County ... but the changing climate conditions change the places where these tropical diseases become endemic and put down roots!â€ � â€œThese any many other consequences , â€ � Gore continues , â€œare really wake - up calls for us .
Mother Nature is giving us a very clear and powerful message : we can not continue putting 110 m tons of global - warming pollution into the atmosphere like itâ€ ™ s an open sewer .
Weâ€ ™ ve got to wake up.â€

Speaking to a raucous crowd of Hillary Clinton supporters in Miami after an extended speech on the issue of climate change , former vice president Al Gore tells the audience that â€œwhen it comes to the most urgent issue facing our country and the world , the choice in this election is extremely clea : HC will make solving the climate crisis a top national priority.â€ � â€œHer opponent , based upon the ideas that he has presented , will take us toward a climate catastrophe , â€ �
Gore says .
â€œThe climate crisis is and must be considered a top national priory , and
a top global priority.â€ �
â€œFor those of you who are younger than 25 , you might not remember the election of 2000 , and what happened here in Florida and across the country , â€ �
Gore , who lost Florida and the election in 2000 , tells the audience to scattered boos and chants of â€œYOU WON!â€ � â€œHereâ€ ™ s my point : I donâ€
™ t want you to be in a position years from now where you welcome Hillary Clinton and say â€˜actually , you did win , it just wasnâ€ ™ t close enough to make sure that all the votes were counted , â€ � Gore says .
â€œElections have consequences !
Your vote counts !
Your vote has consequences!â€ �
After being introduced by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as the single most influential person regarding the issue of climate change , former vice president Al Gore takes the stage in Miami .
Watch it live here :
Patrick Murphy , the Florida Democrat challenging Marco Rubio for his seat in the US Senate , has unloaded on his rival and Donald Trump during his warm - up speech for Clinton and Al Gore in Miami , at which climate change will be the topic of the day .
â€œI grew up on Floridaâ€ ™ s coast , I could swim before I could walk , I could fish before I could talk ,
â€ � he told an appreciative crowd .
â€œFloridians donâ€ ™ t need to be told about the effects of climate change , weâ€ ™ re seeing it first hand .
With the future of the environment on the line , who are the Republicans trying to elect ?
Donald Trump and Marco Rubio .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to protect our waterways with Donald Trump attacking immigrants .
â€œWhen Donald Trump goes low , Marco Rubio is right there with him .
Despite overwhelming existence of the effects of climate change , Marco Rubioâ€ ™
s
quote is :
â€˜Iâ€ ™ m not a scientist.â€ ™ High tides are flooding the streets of Miami Beach and still he refuses to act .
Climate change is real and we need to act.â€ � Press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that the United States would respond to Russian hacking of the DNC and other hacking .
The intelligence community announced last week that it believed Russia was behind hacking of the Democrats which appears to extend to the hacking of Clinton campaign officials feeding the current Wikileaks dump .
â€œWe obviously will ensure that our response is proportional , â€ � Earnest said , according to a pool report .
â€œIt is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance.â€ �
â€œThe president has talked before about the significant capabilities that the US government has to both defend our systems in the United States but also carry out offensive operations in other countries ...
So there are a range of responses that are available to the president and he will consider a response that is proportional.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s a breath of fresh air in the 2016 election cycle :
former vice president Al Gore is about to take the stage in Miami with Hillary Clinton .
Live video stream here :
Barack Obama is scheduled to rally voters on behalf of Hillary Clinton in Greensboro , North Carolina , this evening .
He has just landed outside the city .
Aboard the flight , press secretary Josh Earnest said of Trumpâ€ ™ s hot mic remarks , â€œthose statements consisted of sexual assault , â€ � according to a pool report .
Update : hereâ€ ™ s a transcription of Earnestâ€ ™ s remarks : â€œThe president found the tape as repugnant as most Americans didâ€ � .
â€œThere has been a pretty clear statement by people all along the ideological spectrum that those statements consisted sexual assault.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s why many people I believe have concluded that those statements are worthy of sharp condemnation.â€ �
For the latest on Billy Bush , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s bus buddy , read CNNâ€ ™ s Brian Stelter :
How is Billy Bush related to the other Bushes ?
His father is a younger brother to George HW Bush .
That makes Billy first cousins with Jeb and George W.
The NBC / WSJ poll , which yesterday released numbers for a survey ending before the second debate , has released new numbers taking in the debate .
The poll has Clinton up 10 points on Trump , 50 - 40 , in a head - to - head matchup .
She leads in the poll by nine points in a four - way race : Wikileaks has released a third tranche of John Podesta emails â€ “ the veracity of which the Clinton campaign has not denied â€
“ revealing discussion inside the campaign about how to adapt to Bernie Sanders , how to walk back Clintonâ€ ™ s comments about Aids at Nancy Reaganâ€ ™ s funeral , how to describe â€œeveryday Americansâ€ � and other topics .
Search the Wikileaks emails on the Wikileaks web site here .
The Clinton camp wrestled with Sandersâ€ ™ rise .
â€œMessage needs to be more positive , upbeat , hopeful .
Bernie is saying we can change the world , â€ � an adviser wrote to Podesta , the campaign chairman , at one point .
After Sanders won big in the February New Hampshire primary , the Clinton team discussed its strategy for the upcoming states of South Carolina and Nevada .
In Nevada , an adviser wrote , â€œOur biggest concern is enthusiasm and caucus knowledge .
Sanders supporters are more likely to know the ins and outs of the caucus .
To mitigate this , in the upcoming days our field team is focusing on caucus education among our supporters.â€ �
In South Carolina , the same adviser , Elan Kriegel , noted : â€œLike
Nevada , our support is particularly high with people of color and we are roughly tied with white voters .
The difference between the states is that far more African - American voters will participate in South Carolina than Nevada.â€ �
The campaign had lengthy discussions over how to retract and apologize for Clintonâ€ ™ s assertion at Nancy Reaganâ€ ™ s funeral that the former first lady had â€œstarted
a national conversationâ€ � about HIV / Aids â€œwhen
before nobody would talk about it.â€ �
The Reagans did not acknowledge the epidemic as it unfolded .
On a separate email chain , aides discuss whether the phrase â€œeveryday Americansâ€ � should be in a Clinton speech in New Hampshire about small business .
A draft of the speech had Clinton saying : Iâ€ ™ m running for President because you and Americans everywhere need a champion .
And I want to be that champion .
At which Podesta weighed in : I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans , but I think we should use it once the first time she says Iâ€ ™ m running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion .
I think if she doesnâ€ ™ t say it once , people will notice and say we false started in Iowa .
Do you notice how Podesta did not place the phrase â€œeveryday Americansâ€ � in quotes in his email ?
So have a lot of Trump supporters , who are asserting that the email is a smoking gun proving that Hillary Clinton has begun to hate everyday Americans , which it isnâ€ ™ t .
On a separate email chain , then - DNC vice chair and CNN commentator Donna Brazile shares in advance a question about the death penalty that Clinton might face at a CNN town hall : â€œHereâ€ ™ s one that worries me about HRC ,
â€ � Brazile wrote .
Much of the emails show the campaign discussing media strategy and emailing with the media , in some cases on friendly terms .
Hereâ€ ™ s a section discussing responses to a potential Joe Biden presidential run :
And the Green Party takes offense at a Podesta email referring to Ross Perot , the Reform party nominee who ran against Bill Clinton and George HW Bush in 1992 .
After campaign manager Robby Mook suggests â€œWJC redux of 1992,â€ � Podesta replies , â€œjust need a third party spoiler and weâ€ ™ ll be all set.â€ �
â€˜Iâ€ ™ m beginning to worry about Rubioâ€ ™
The senate majority leader forecloses any discussion of his partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee : Have you read David Brooksâ€ ™ concern - trolly column about Trump in todayâ€ ™ s New York Times ?
Hereâ€ ™ s a bit : Trump breaks his own world record for being appalling on a weekly basis , but as the campaign sinks to new low after new low , I find myself experiencing feelings of deep sadness and pity .
Imagine if you had to go through a single day without sharing kind little moments with strangers and friends .
Imagine if you had to endure a single week in a hate - filled world , crowded with enemies of your own making , the object of disgust and derision .
You would be a twisted , tortured shrivel , too , and maybe youâ€ ™
d lash out and try to take cruel revenge on the universe .
For Trump this is his whole life .

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton now has an 11 percentage point lead over her Republican opponent Donald Trump , according to a poll released by PRRI and the Atlantic on Tuesday , writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi : If that werenâ€ ™ t already reason enough for Trump supporters to worry , a poll from NBC and the Wall Street Journal released on Monday put Clintonâ€ ™ s lead at 14 percentage points .
But why the difference in numbers ?
If you want to follow polls in the 28 remaining days before the US votes , I strongly recommend you ignore the date that the poll was published â€ “ and focus instead on the dates that the poll was conducted .
That PRRI / Atlantic poll was based on landline and cellphone interviews that took place October 5 - 9 while the data for the NBC / WSJ poll was gathered October 8 - 9 .
Those dates are potentially significant given that on October 8 , a 2005 recordingwas released of Trump saying that , thanks to his fame , he was able to grab women â€œby the pussyâ€ � .

Guess which campaign is doing a better job registering voters in Florida ?
And North Carolina : Hereâ€ ™ s related reading from the New York Times :
The first wave of data from states like Florida and North Carolina shows preliminary signs that Mrs. Clinton was building a slight edge even before the revelation that Donald J. Trump had bragged about sexual assaultroiled the race .
Democrats are requesting more absentee ballots in Florida than they were at this point in 2012 , with increases of 50 percent in the heavily Hispanic areas around Miami and Orlando .
In North Carolina , where Mitt Romney built enough of a lead in early voting four years ago to edge out a victory over President Obama , Democrats are requesting mail - in ballots in larger numbers than in 2012 , while Republicansâ€ ™ participation is declining .
If Clintonâ€ ™ s ground game is as solid as it appears , and recent polling trendlines hold , and with a couple other caveats , itâ€ ™ s easy to imagine a map like this : With voter registration deadlines falling today in numerous states , the Guardian interactive team has taken a look at voter turnout in each state .

Former Fox talker Glenn Beck , an erstwhile Ted Cruz friend who has ranted about Barack Obama being a racist and compared Al Gore to Hitler , has written on Facebook that Hillary Clinton is
the â€œmoral , ethicalâ€ � choice in this election .
â€œIt is not acceptable to ask a moral , dignified man to cast his vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity ,
â€ �
Beck writes .
â€œIf the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton , so be it .
At least it is a moral , ethical choice .
If she is elected , the world does not end ....
Once elected , Hillary can be fought ...
The alternative does not offer a moral person the same opportunity .
If one helps to elect an immoral man to the highest office , then one is merely validating his immorality , lewdness , and depravity .

Both campaigns have released new ads out today .
The Trump campaign argues that Clinton is not the right leader for these dangerous times , while the Clinton campaign uses people reading from her book â€œIt takes a villageâ€ � to appeal to Mormon voters to give her a look .
First the Trump ad .
It adds a twist to the world - is - scary campaign video trope by mixing in video of Clinton stumbling getting into her van , coughing and being helped on a staircase .
â€œOur next president faces daunting challenges in a dangerous world ...

â€œHillary Clinton doesnâ€ ™ t have the fortitude , strength and stamina to lead in our world.â€ �
The Clinton campaign ad , â€œWe are Mormons for Hillary , â€ � could not frame a stronger contrast .
It features sweeping shots of beautiful western landscapes and pictures kids flying kites , with a voiceover message about mutual reinforcement and the common good .

Everyone is : There has been no shortage this election cycle of stories about how Paul Ryan , the top elected Republican , might un - endorse Donald Trump .
Itâ€ ™ s now 11 October â€ “ 28 days out
â€ “ and Trump is attacking Ryan highly publicly as â€œvery weak and ineffectiveâ€
� and Trump appears to be trying to crush , Stephen Bannon - style , the rest of the Republican party which is essential to Ryanâ€ ™ s life work if anything is .
And here this morning Politico has another story , based on unnamed sources , about how Ryan may un - endorse Donald Trump : Paul Ryan may not be done yet .
As thoroughly as the House speaker shocked the national political establishment Monday by saying heâ€ ™ s done with Donald Trump and itâ€ ™ s time to focus on his House majority , thereâ€ ™ s a distinct possibility Ryan will go a step further and completely yank his endorsement , sources close to him told POLITICO .
In fact , Ryan has personally been on the edge of pulling the plug but has held out because his decision is about more than just his personal feelings :
Itâ€ ™ s about saving his massive 60-seat majority .
The Wisconsin Republican is in an excruciating spot :
He feels torn between his own conscience and his obligations as the top Republican in the country , according to multiple sources in leadership familiar with the internal discussions .
Not to mention , nearly everyone in House Republican leadership believes there are more embarrassing revelations about Trump to come before Nov. 8 .
For now : Instead of embedding each new Trump tweet in its own block , weâ€ ™ ll do periodic roundups ( if he keeps going ) .
Hereâ€ ™ s volume one , including his new tweet , for posterity :
Maybe this is Trumpâ€ ™ s strategy : get the headlines away from the debate his surrogates are pushing about whether unwanted genital - touching constitutes sexual assault .
Itâ€ ™ s a distraction technique ?
Thereâ€ ™ s another possible explanation for Trumpâ€ ™ s erratic strategy : he is an erratic candidate .
Whatâ€ ™ s Trumpâ€ ™ s game here ?
Is he hoping that a spectacular split with elected Republicans will give him the votes he needs in ME-2 to tip the dominoes through New Hampshire and North Carolina which all , assuming he wins Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s states , would give him 272 electoral votes and the presidency ( see this scenario , mapped ) ?
Or is this more a look at shackles - off Trump , a Trump who does not need state parties and polls and least of all â€œunderachievingâ€ � John Kingâ€ ™ s electoral map ?
While Trump is focused this morning on # winning by doing things his own way , his son Eric Trump is trying to make sure voters donâ€ ™ t miss registration deadlines .
Which is precisely the kind of thing that the national party infrastructure could help with .
There are indications , meanwhile , that for Republicans , the only reward for bailing on Trump now may be spiritual .

This blog has not made it common practice to showcase the thinking of Katrina Pierson , the Trump surrogate whose controversial statements often seem to play out over in the corner while the campaign action is at midfield .
However in this case , Pierson gives voice to an argument heard elsewhere in the last 24 hours from the mouths of other prominent Trump supporters : itâ€ ™ s hypocritical to find fault with Trumpâ€ ™ s hot mic statement about grabbing genitalia without consent because , hip - hop .
Pierson :
But I do quite [ sic ] find it rich that we have Democrats and the left talking about rape culture , when theyâ€ ™ re the ones backed fully by Hollywood .
This rape culture is purported [ sic ] by none other than the entertainment industry , none other than hip - hop music , which you can hear on local radio stations .
The culture war on hip - hop is as old as rap and was preceded by fear of rock â€˜nâ€ ™ roll .

This morning on Twitter , Trump has attacking House speaker Paul Ryan and by extension the Republican leadership and rank and file : At least three Republicans on Ryanâ€ ™ s conference call Tuesday were quoted as objecting to what they said was the leadershipâ€ ™ s cowardice and defeatism .
Hereâ€ ™ s what Ryan is up to this morning : Republicans who break with Donald Trump may face ballot box retribution , pollster Frank Luntz points out .
( They may sense this . )
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Republican officials have been tying themselves in tightening knots in an attempt to argue that touching womenâ€ ™ s genitalia without consent , as described by Donald Trump , does not constitute sexual assault .
The communications director of the Republican national committee , Sean Spicer , appears to have lied point - blank to the Washington Post last night , denying a quote that had been attributed to him in which he dodged the sexual assault question by saying : â€œIâ€ ™ m not a lawyer.â€ � Confronted with a recording of his remarks , Spicer finally admitted saying it , and released this further statement : Spicerâ€ ™ s comments follow remarks by Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway , who admonished people on Monday to quit saying â€œsexual assaultâ€
� : â€œThatâ€
™ s a very unfortunate phrase , and people really should stop using it , â€ � Conway said .
Alabama senator Jeff Sessions , meanwhile , told the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard that he wouldnâ€ ™ t characterize unwanted touching and kissing as sexual assault .
â€œI think thatâ€ ™ s a stretch , â€ � he said .

2016-10-14,"A new study has just appeared in the Journal of Climate which deals with an issue commonly raised by those who deny that human - caused climate change is a serious risk .
As I have written many times , we know humans are causing the Earthâ€ ™ s climate to change .
We know this for many reasons .
First , we know that certain gases trap heat ; this fact is indisputable .
Second , we know that humans have significantly increased the amount of heat - trapping gases in the atmosphere .
Again , this is indisputable .
Third , we know the Earth is warming ( again indisputable ) .
We know the Earth warms because we are actually measuring the warming rate in multiple different ways .
Those measurements are in good agreement with each other .
Of course there is other evidence too .
For instance , ice loss across the globe is widespread : in the Arctic , the Antarctic ice shelves , Greenland , and from land glaciers .
Sea levels are rising as warm water expands in volume and as melt waters flow into the ocean .
We are also seeing changes of weather patterns and climatic zones shift .
The point is , there is a whole body of evidence that proves the climate is changing and the change is caused largely by human emissions of greenhouse gases .
Over the years , contrarians have looked for evidence that the climate either isnâ€ ™ t changing or the change is not as fast as predicted .
Their findings have often been used in the media to suggest that human - caused climate change was not something to worry about .
But weâ€ ™ ve seen , over and over and over again , that these contrarian arguments donâ€ ™ t hold up .
Repeatedly , mainstream scientists have taken these claims seriously and discovered they were just plain wrong .
In some cases , the contrarians have made simple arithmetic errors ( like mixing up a negative and positive sign in their equations ) , while in others , they have made more fundamental errors .
But regardless , they have been wrong time after time .
But whenever they are found to be wrong , they just go and find some new piece of evidence that once again calls into doubt our understanding of the human - climate link .
One contrarian argument has appeared repeatedly over the past few years , even at a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce held by Ted Cruz in 2015 .
The claim was by well - known contrarian John Christy .
Christy claimed that the mid - troposphere temperatures ( temperatures in approximately the middle of the atmosphere ) are rising three times faster in climate models when compared with measurements .
Another related claim is that there has been no statistically significant warming in the troposphere ( lower part of the atmosphere ) for 18 years .
Now , both of these facts , even if they were true , would not prove much .
We know the Earth is warming because of measurements in oceans , underground , and at the Earthâ€ ™ s surface .
But it would open a question as to why the atmosphere is behaving differently .
The recent paper just published looked at these two claims .
The authors found errors in the analysis that , when corrected , debunked the contrarian claims .
Let me explain some of the science .
First , these atmospheric temperatures are measured by satellites which can â€œseeâ€ � the temperature of gases in the atmosphere .
It works differently from a thermometer but regardless , such measurements are possible .
These measurements have a lot of uncertainty .
First of all , as the Earth warms from greenhouse gases , the upper part of the atmosphere should cool down .
A simplistic but appropriate description is that greenhouse gases hold the heat down toward the Earth , making the upper atmosphere cooler .
Since the satellites see both the upper and lower parts of the atmosphere , the cooling upper region may contaminate the measurements of the warming lower part of the atmosphere .
A second source of uncertainty is that the satellites themselves are not perfect .
When satellites are launched , they orbit the Earth for a number of years until they are replaced by new satellites .
The data , which goes back to 1979 , is actually stitched together from multiple satellites in sequence .
No two satellites are completely identical â€ “ sort of like no two thermometers will give exactly the same temperature .
These differences have to be rectified and are another source of error .
Additionally , the satellites change while they are in orbit , in particular they lose altitude and their orbiting time drifts ( the time they pass certain global locations drifts later and later in the day ) .
Both of these facts contaminate the measurements and must be accounted for .
There are other accuracy issues as well that space doesnâ€ ™ t permit discussion , but you get the point .
So , this recent paper did a few things .
First , they took the contrarian argument that the mid - troposphere temperatures have been rising at only 1/3 the rate predicted by models .
They found that Christyâ€ ™ s team neglected the contamination of the cooling in the upper stratosphere .
When they applied this correction , they found that Christyâ€ ™ s claim was incorrect .
Differences between modeled and observed warming rates were much smaller , and had known explanations .
Next , the authors asked whether it is true that there has been no warming in the lower atmosphere ( troposphere ) in the past 18 years .
They found that for five of the six groups that provide satellite temperature analysis , this claim was also incorrect .
Finally , they asked whether it is true that the temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are in disagreement in models and measurements .
Their result is that when temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are compared , one of three satellite records is in close agreement with the climate models .
While this paper largely debunks the most current contrarian mainstay , it doesnâ€ ™ t answer all of our questions .
For instance , exactly how accurate are these satellite measurements and how can they be made better ?
Do the models capture all of the thermal processes which are occurring , especially in the middle and upper layer of the atmosphere ?
Why does there appear to be a small difference in the satellites and the model predictions in the middle of the atmosphere ?
Is this difference important ?
These questions can be answered , but a prerequisite is a continuation of high - quality data from satellites .
This means a continued commitment to launching new measurement satellites as the current fleet ages ."
2016-11-01,"With the presidential election one week away , a handful of Republicans are already vowing to oppose any nominee to the supreme court proposed by Hillary Clinton should she be elected .
At least three Republican senators have voiced support for indefinitely blocking Clinton from filling the supreme court vacancy left by the late justice Antonin Scalia , thus breaking with a 150-year precedent for having nine justices serving on the nationâ€ ™ s highest bench .
Senators Ted Cruz , of Texas ; John McCain , of Arizona ; and Richard Burr , of North Carolina have all suggested leaving Scaliaâ€ ™ s seat open if Clinton reaches the White House .
Cruz , in particular , argued there was a â€œlong historical precedentâ€ � for having fewer than nine justices on the supreme court .
Senate Republican leaders have yet to hold a hearing or a vote on Merrick Garland , who was nominated by Barack Obama to replace Scalia in March .
Republicans justified their refusal to move forward on the Garland nomination by saying the next president should fill the vacancy .
But as Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s path to the White House narrows , a potential split is emerging within the party ranks on how to proceed when Congress returns after the election for a lame duck session .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , for example , was not willing to go as far as Cruz and his other colleagues when asked by the Guardian if he supported an indefinite blockade under a prospective Clinton presidency .
â€œNo , I donâ€ ™ t believe that we should do that if they propose nominees that are good , â€ � Rubio , who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination , said in an interview last week .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to go and predispose them that way.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s response came with the caveat , however , that he found it unlikely Clinton would nominate an individual who shared his view of the role of the court .
â€œIf itâ€ ™
s someone good who understands that their job is to apply the constitution , according to its original intent , then that will be a welcome surprise , â€ �
he said .
â€œBut barring whether itâ€ ™ s Republican or a Democrat , if they appoint someone who I believe doesnâ€ ™ t meet that standard Iâ€ ™ ll oppose that nominee.â€ � Rubio , facing a tighter than expected re - election battle in Florida , has not met with Garland and has expressed his opposition to Obamaâ€ ™ s nomination .
Burr , who is locked in a dead heat for his own re - election in North Carolina , made a far more declarative statement on how he would treat a supreme court nominee under Clinton .
â€œIf Hillary Clinton becomes president , I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now , we still got an opening on the supreme court , â€ �
Burr told Republican volunteers in a private meeting , according to leaked audio first reported by CNN .
McCain , another vulnerable incumbent Republican , similarly vowed to oppose any nominee under Clinton last month , stating in a radio show interview : â€œI promise you that we will be united against any supreme court nominee that Hillary Clinton , if she were president , would put up .
I promise you.â€ �
McCain later walked back his pledge when faced with criticism .
McCainâ€ ™ s colleague from Arizona , Senator Jeff Flake , has adopted a far more conciliatory tone by calling on Republicans to move forward with the Garland nomination in the lame duck session if Clinton is elected .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a difference between what might be constitutional and what you could do politically and what you should do , â€ � Flake told Politico .
â€œAnd I think leaving a vacancy for up to four years is not why weâ€ ™ re here .
â€œIt may be what becomes a litmus test if youâ€ ™ re a true conservative â€ ¦ Just to go on record , I wonâ€ ™ t be part of that.â€ � Chuck Grassley , the Iowa senator who chairs the Senate judiciary committee , also rejected the proposed tactics of blanket opposition .
â€œIf that new president happens to be Hillary , we canâ€ ™ t just simply stonewall , â€ �
Grassley told reporters on a conference call last month .
Mitch McConnell , the Senate majority leader , has also reaffirmed his belief that the next president should fill the vacancy left by Scalia .
The White House sharply criticized Republicans proposing a smaller supreme court bench under Clinton .
Josh Earnest , the White House press secretary , said such an approach was â€œthe same kind of dysfunction that has infected Washington for the last six yearsâ€ � .
Public opinion of the supreme court reveals a fairly even ideological split in its favorability and how it should interpret the constitution .
But a majority of the American public has expressed disagreement with the decision by Republicans to not hold a hearing on Garlandâ€ ™ s nomination ."
2016-11-01,"What do Rosie Oâ€ ™ Donnell , Serge Kovaleski , Megyn Kelly , John McCain , Jeb Bush , Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz , Gonzalo Curiel , Khizr Khan and Alicia Machado have in common ?
All have been on the receiving end of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s insults as the businessman spent more than a year pursuing futile feuds that may go a long way toward costing him the White House .
A chorus of hands slapping against Republican foreheads was almost audible each time the nominee threw off any pretence of self - discipline and lashed out , distracting onlookers from his efforts to present himself as moderate or exploit Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s weaknesses .
This week they are doubtless praying that he doesnâ€ ™ t squander the golden opportunity presented by the FBIâ€ ™ s investigation into a new batch of emails that may be related to Clintonâ€ ™ s private server .

Soon after launching his presidential campaign , Trump said of the Arizona senator and former Vietnam prisoner of war John McCain :
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not a war hero .
Heâ€ ™ s a war hero because he was captured .
I like people who werenâ€ ™ t captured.â€ �
It later emerged that Trump had been granted four education draft deferments and one medical .
The latter was due to bone spurs in his heels .
Cohen , who was McCainâ€ ™ s best man , recalled : â€œI was outraged about it .
To this day John McCain canâ€ ™ t lift his arm to shoulder level .
To say that about what he went through being tortured , his sense of patriotism , from a man who avoided the draft with a bone spur ?
No , I donâ€
™ t think so .
It turned me immediately.â€
�
Then there was the Republican primary in which Trump dismissed rivals as â€œlow energyâ€ � Jeb Bush , â€œLittleâ€ �
Marco Rubio and â€œLyinâ€ ™
â€ � Ted Cruz .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s gone out of his way to demean , degrade , denigrate and delegitimise , â€ � Cohen said , â€œall the Ds you can think of .
I think that gives you real insight into the manâ€ ™ s character.â€ � Cohen , 76 , now heads a business advisory firm .
He added : â€œItâ€ ™ s unheard of in my lifetime to see anyone engaged in this vulgarity and crudity of language and attitude .
What weâ€ ™ ve seen is something pretty horrific in our political system that Iâ€ ™ ve never seen before and I hope Iâ€ ™ ll never see again.â€ �
The McCain incident also weighed heavily on Republican strategist Rick Wilson , despite his own past clashes with the 2008 presidential nominee .
â€œBut the most outrageous and revealing thing , â€ � he said , â€œwas the attack on the Khan family and the continued attacks from his supporters.â€ � Khizr Khan , whose son , an American Muslim , was killed in Iraq , denounced Trump at the Democratic national convention in July , while brandishing a copy of the US constitution .
Trump criticised the Gold Star family while claiming that he too had made sacrifices as a businessman , triggering a wave of revulsion .
Wilson continued : â€œThe list of people heâ€ ™ s insulted is long and distinguished .
There are no boundaries on this guy about who heâ€ ™ s going to offend .
Heâ€ ™ s angry at everybody and acts in a way that reflects his poor impulse control .
Heâ€ ™ s basically inhumane .
â€œPolitics is a tough game and we have elbows out but there are certain lanes we try not to play out of .
Iâ€ ™ m one of the toughest
but I leave children out of it .
Iâ€
™ m astonished at what heâ€ ™ s gotten away with.â€ �
According to a running total compiled by the New York Times , Trump has insulted 279 people , places and things on Twitter alone .
Republicans were ultimately forced to conclude that Trump would be Trump , a 70-year - old man who can not change and has no intention of doing so .
They will never know if staying â€œon messageâ€ � might have left him running far closer in the polls .
â€˜The straw that broke the camelâ€ ™ s backâ€ ™ Rich Galen , once press secretary to vice - president Dan Quayle , said his patience ran out in July when the nominee claimed that Gonzalo Curiel , a judge who was born in Indiana , was biased against him in a civil case over Trump University because his parents were from Mexico .
â€œThat was antithetical to everything Iâ€ ™ ve worked for in public life ,
â€ �
Galen said .
â€œIt looks like the actual turning point was the Miss Universe woman , which not only offended women but they told their husbands they should be offended too .
Itâ€ ™ s one thing to diss John McCain but
heâ€ ™ s a big boy and can look after himself .
When he went after a woman over an image problem , that would unite 90 % of women and men and was the straw that broke the camelâ€ ™ s back.â€ � Machado won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996 .
Clinton brought up the largely forgotten case at the end of the first presidential debate , saying Trump had called her â€œMiss Piggyâ€ � and , because she is Latina , â€œMiss Housekeepingâ€ � .
To the dismay of his party , Trump took the bait and talked about Machado for days , telling Fox News : â€œShe gained a massive amount of weight , and it was a real problem.â€ � â€œHe sees the entire universe in terms of how it affects him , â€ �
Galen said .
â€œHe simply doesnâ€ ™ t have the temperament to be president of the United States .
He figured out what the country had been mad about ; he was the wrong messenger for the right message.â€ �
Trump accused Mexican immigrants of being â€œrapistsâ€ � , drug traffickers and criminals at his campaign launch in June 2015 .
He said Fox News presenter
Megyn Kelly had â€œblood coming out of her whereverâ€ � .
He mocked Kovaleski , a New York Times reporter who has a congenital joint condition .
When a videotape came to light in which Trump boasted about groping women , and then several women came forward to accuse him of sexual assault , he did what he always does : he picked a fight with his accusers and the media that reported their claims .
Trumpâ€ ™ s outlandish statements have stunned Republican party grandees .
William Brock , 85 , a former chair of the Republican National Committee who served under Ronald Reagan as US trade representative and secretary of labor , criticised him for attacking both politicians , who are fair game , and civilians , who are not .
â€œThere has not been a distance drawn between individuals not involved in politics
â€
“ Rosie Oâ€ ™ Donnell , the Khan family â€ “ and the Obamas , the McCains , the Clintons , which are a part of his core message and tend to reinforce what his supporters want , â€ � Brock said .
â€œThere has been an unwillingness or inability to choose the targets that really would validate his message rather than just what pops up at that moment.â€ � Brock is no fan of Clinton and feels she has made insults of her own .
â€œThe thing thatâ€ ™
s troubling about the Trump support base , â€ � he said , â€œis
itâ€
™ s almost they donâ€
™ t exist to much of Washington .
When Clinton said theyâ€ ™ re deplorable , thatâ€ ™ s a judgment thatâ€ ™ s unethical and wrong.â€ �
Given Clintonâ€ ™ s high unpopularity rating , and the current flare up around the FBIâ€ ™ s probe into whether she mishandled classified information as secretary of state , a conventional Republican in a conventional year might have fared well against her .
Republican consultant James Harris believes that if he had managed to avoid all his gaffes , Trump would be leading in the polls .
It is a case of what might have been .
â€œBut for Trumpâ€ ™ s comments and self - inflicted wounds and random tangents , â€ � he said , â€œhe would be tied or up a point or two in Florida , Ohio , North Carolina , Nevada .
â€œIf you look at wage stagnation in those states , they want change , but he is not articulating a vision of change .
Voters are worried about the future direction of the country but weâ€ ™ re talking about Miss Universe .
Who gives a ratâ€ ™ s ass about that?â€ �"
2016-11-08,"The 2016 Republican primary was supposed to be an embarrassment of riches for the GOP .
In contrast to 2012 , the Republican party was set to feature a slew of young , articulate conservative superstars fighting it out for the nomination .
The only question was whether it would be the year of a tough - as - nails union - busting Wisconsin governor ( Scott Walker ) , an inspiring Florida senator ( Marco Rubio ) , an ideological Texas firebrand ( Ted Cruz ) , or perhaps an Oxford - educated policy wonk from the Bayou ( former governor Bobby Jindal ) .
Or , maybe , one of the more seasoned former conservative governors would win the day , such as Floridaâ€ ™ s Jeb Bush or Texasâ€ ™ s Rick Perry .
But such hopes were dashed on 16 June 2015 when one Donald J Trump took what he now calls the â€œfamous escalator rideâ€ � down Trump Tower to announce his candidacy .
The establishment immediately mocked him .
But he went on to shock them .
Over the next 11 months , the ideologically malleable alleged billionaire browbeat his way to the Republican nomination .
He tagged his opponents as too low energy ( Bush ) , too dishonest ( Cruz ) and too little and sweaty ( Rubio ) for the Oval Office .
He would allow nothing to stand in his way â€ “ certainly not the truth â€ “ in his quest for the Republican nomination .
To evangelicals , the thrice - married New Yorker with a potty mouth that made even Howard Stern blush pretended to be a committed Christian , even declaring that the reason the IRS was auditing his tax returns was probably because of his religious devotion .
To immigration hawks , he pledged to deport each and every illegal immigrant in the country , even though he said after the 2012 election that the reason Mitt Romney lost was because of his harsh stand on immigration .
But Trump didnâ€ ™ t win the Republican nomination because of his policy positions .
He won because of his personality and brand .
For nearly four decades , he painted himself as the worldâ€ ™ s greatest businessman .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
lifelong marketing scheme got a boost from Hollywood in 2004 when he was cast as the star of the NBC reality TV show The Apprentice , where he flaunted his executive authority each week in front of millions .
Trump was at his best when he wasnâ€ ™ t talking specifics .
He promised to make all Americaâ€ ™ s problems go away , to make America great again , if Americans just put their faith in him .
He was the strongman who was going to make everything OK if you just trusted him and didnâ€ ™ t ask questions .
And it worked in the Republican primary .
But the nomination fight revealed much more about Trumpâ€ ™ s Republican opponents and the Republican electorate than it did about Trump .
To those who cared to look , it was well known before Trump ever entered the presidential race that he was a dishonest lout whose business success was far less than claimed .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s presence in the race revealed that the supposed GOP superstars were too weak to stand up to the charlatan in their midst .
As for the Republican primary electorate , we learned that perhaps they donâ€ ™ t care so much about conservative principles after all â€ “ that the conservative movement may be nothing more than a collection of magazine offices and think tanks in Manhattan and Washington , DC .
No true believer in conservative principles could ever get behind Donald Trump .
In winning the Republican nomination , Donald Trump may have destroyed the Republican party and drastically set back the conservative movement .
His anti - immigrant vitriol , his mainstreaming of conspiracy theories , his portrayal of American exceptionalism as an arrogant concept , his anti - women invective and , yes , his occasional racism will taint the Republican party for the foreseeable future .
Well , it will taint the Republican party if it lasts .
But that remains an open question .
The odds are Hillary Clinton will win , and the question will then be : what will become of the Republican party ?
Will the # NeverTrump wing and the Always Trump forces come together ?
Or will a civil war break out , ultimately tearing the party it apart ?
The GOP should have been ascendant this election cycle .
Instead , it lies in ruins , all thanks to Donald Trump .
Heâ€
™ s the man of the hour , exactly as he would want it to be ."
2016-11-21,"Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s unorthodox US presidential transition continued on Monday when he held talks with one of the most prominent supporters of leftwing Democrat Bernie Sanders .
The president - electâ€ ™ s first meeting of the day at Trump Tower in New York was with Tulsi Gabbard , a Democratic maverick who endorsed the socialist Sanders during his unsuccessful primary battle with Hillary Clinton .
Over the past few days Trump has also held talks with Mitt Romney , who once branded him a â€œphonyâ€ � but is now under consideration for possible secretary of state , Ted Cruz , whom he labelled â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � during the Republican primary campaign , and Democrat Michelle Rhee , the former schools chief of Washington , who is mooted as a possible education secretary .
The celebrity businessmanâ€ ™ s aides have characterised him as a deal maker who intends to cast the net wide for diverse talents .
Barack Obama has called Trump â€œpragmaticâ€ � , not an â€œideologueâ€ � , while former secretary of state Henry Kissinger said he would be a unique president because he â€œhas no obligation to any particular groupâ€ � .
He is entertaining both loyalists and rivals , although his three appointments so far â€ “ Jeff Sessions for attorney general , Mike Pompeo for CIA chief and Michael Flynn for national security adviser â€ “ have been in the former category .
At first glance Gabbard , who is from Hawaii and is the first Hindu member of the US Congress , seems an unlikely counsellor .
She resigned from the Democratic National Committee to back Vermont senator Sanders and formally nominated him for president at the party convention in July , crediting him with starting a â€œmovement of love and compassionâ€ � , although by then Clintonâ€ ™ s victory was certain .
But the Iraq war veteran has also expressed views that might appeal to Trump , criticising Obama , condemning interventionist wars in Iraq and Libya and taking a hard line on immigration .
In 2014 , she called for a rollback of the visa waiver programme for Britain and other European countries with what she called â€œIslamic extremistâ€ � populations .
In October last year she tweeted :
â€œAl - Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and must be defeated .
Obama wonâ€
™ t bomb them in Syria .
Putin did .
# neverforget911.â€ �
She was then among 47 Democrats who joined Republicans to pass a bill mandating a stronger screening process for refugees from Iraq and Syria coming to the US .
Media reports have suggested that Trumpâ€ ™ s chief strategist Steve Bannon is an admirer of Gabbard .
Last week , when 169 Democrats signed a letter condemning Bannonâ€ ™ s appointment by Trump for encouraging white nationalism , she was not among them .
Trump , the former host of The Apprentice , continues to throw out hints and teases about his cabinet picks reminiscent of a reality TV show .
â€œWe really had some great meetings , and youâ€ ™ ll be hearing about them soon ,
â€ �
he said on Sunday .
His other meetings on Monday included talks with Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin , former Texas governor and Republican presidential rival Rick Perry , and executives and anchors from major TV networks .
Kellyanne Conway , Trumpâ€ ™ s former campaign manager and still a key aide , told Fox News that Perry is a possible contender to lead the defense or energy departments while Fallin is being considered to head the interior department .
Meanwhile there was no sign of an end to the war of words between Trump and the hit Broadway show Hamilton .
Actor Brandon Victor Dixon , who plays Vice - President Aaron Burr in the award - winning musical , directly addressed Vice - President - elect Mike Pence after Fridayâ€ ™ s performance , expressing fears that his administration would not protect Americaâ€ ™ s diversity .
Trump used Twitter to demand an apology .
But Dixon told CBSâ€ ™ s breakfast show This Morning that he was delivering the message on behalf of the producers , creators and the cast .
â€œWe recognise Hamilton is an inherently American story , itâ€ ™ s told by the definition of the American community , â€ � he said .
â€œWe are men and women of different colours , creeds and orientations and the resonant nature of the show throughout the world demands we make statements when there are important issues facing us as a community .
We wanted to stand up and spread a message of love and unity considering the emotional outpouring since the election .
â€œConversation is not harassment and I was appreciative that Vice - President - elect Pence stood there and listened to what we had to say.â€
�
Dixon said Pence was welcome to come backstage to have conversations with the cast about their concerns .
He added that the showâ€ ™ s creator Lin - Manuel Miranda , who played Hamilton as a member of the original cast , was involved in writing the message .
Asked how he felt about Trumpâ€ ™ s demand for an apology , Dixon said : â€œThere is nothing to apologise for â€ ¦ We welcome Donald Trump at Hamilton because I think the power of our show and the way we tell it is undeniable.â€ �
Trump tweeted nine times over the weekend .
Two tweets were about his transition plans ; the other messages complained about Hamilton , a skit on Saturday Night Live , Democratic senator Harry Reid and his recently settled fraud case over Trump University .
The billionaire businessman will spend Thanksgiving at his Mar - a - Lago resort in Florida .
Jason Miller , a spokesman for the transition team , said Trump would get together with family and take a brief break from transition planning , â€œhopefully eating some turkeyâ€ � .

2016-11-27,"Leading Republicans condemned Fidel Castro on Sunday but uncertainty remained over whether the incoming Trump administration would make good on campaign promises to reverse the normalization of relations instigated by Barack Obama .
â€œYou wouldnâ€ ™ t go to Pol Potâ€ ™ s funeral , â€ �
Texas senator Ted Cruz told ABCâ€ ™ s This Week .
â€œYou shouldnâ€ ™ t be doing what Obama and [ Canadian prime minister Justin ]
Trudeau are doing , celebrating Castro.â€ �
In response to news of Castroâ€ ™ s death on Saturday , aged 90 , Obama released a carefully worded statement that did not criticise or praise the leader , instead saying : â€œThe Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.â€ �
Trudeau attracted widespread criticism for a statement that many saw as too laudatory .
Cruz , who is of Cuban descent , said Castro had been â€œa murderous dictatorâ€ � and said : â€œThis tyrannical regime has gotten stronger because of a weak president , weak foreign policy.â€ � Cruzâ€ ™ s criticism of policy under Obama and Castroâ€ ™ s brother RaÃºl , the current Cuban president , was echoed by Florida senator Marco Rubio , another former presidential candidate of Cuban descent .
Rubio , who has long been one of the harshest critics of Obamaâ€ ™ s efforts and has links to Cuban Americans in Miami who celebrated news of Castroâ€ ™ s death , said the presidentâ€ ™ s comments were â€œpatheticâ€ � .
Asked on CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union about Obamaâ€ ™ s statement and that issued by Pope Francis , who expressed sorrow regarding Castroâ€ ™ s death , Rubio said that as a Catholic he looked to the pope for spiritual guidance , not political .
â€œBarack Obama is the president of the most powerful country in the world , â€ � he said .
â€œAnd what I called pathetic is not mentioning whatsoever in that statement the reality that there are thousands upon thousands of people who suffered brutally under the Castro regime .
â€œHe executed people .
He jailed people for 20 to 30 years .
[ In ] the Florida Straits â€ ¦ thousands of people â€ ¦ lost their lives fleeing his dictatorship .
And not to acknowledge any of that in the statement
, I felt was pathetic , absolutely.â€ � Obama began normalizing relations with the island in 2014 , with the help of Pope Francis , after what many viewed as a failed embargo and 50 years of harsh sanctions .
This year he became the first president to visit the island since 1928 .
The embargo is still formally in place but normalization allowed the island nation greater access to the internet , the export of some goods , direct flights from the US and a likely boost to the Cuban middle class .
Critics have argued that the US conceded too much .
On Sunday , Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway focused on the â€œdealâ€ � , telling ABC the US got â€œnothing in returnâ€ � .
She did not , however , give many clues to likely Trump policy .
â€œ[Trump ] is open to any number of possibilities , â€ � she said .
â€œHe is open to researching and , in fact , resetting relations with Cuba.â€ �
On Fox News Sunday , Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus discussed Trumpâ€ ™
s wish for reforms by the RaÃºl Castro government , for â€œsome movement or some schedule of movementâ€ � on Cubaâ€ ™ s part that would be necessary to â€œthen schedule some kind of relationshipâ€ � the country .
The president - elect was â€œabsolutelyâ€
� willing to reverse diplomatic openness , Priebus said , but before any decision was taken â€œthere has to be something , and what that something is
â€ ¦ is yet to be determinedâ€ � .
Following Castroâ€ ™ s death , Trump issued a statement that called Castro a â€œbrutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decadesâ€ � .
Over more than a year of campaigning , he said both that expanded diplomatic relations were â€œfineâ€ � and that he would reverse Obamaâ€ ™ s policy .
In interviews with the Guardian on Saturday , academics cited growing US business interest in Cuba as one indicator that Trump would not put relations into reverse .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a businessman , â€ � said Gregory Weeks , of the University of North Carolina in Charlotte .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s been interested in doing business in Cuba.â€ �
Trump has been accused of investigating a business deal in Cuba while sanctions were in place , in the Clinton era .
Weeks added : â€œThere is not a whole lot of interest in rolling back Cuba policy .
The business side of the Republican party is very much in favour of it.â€ �"

2017-01-04,"Three Republican senators have introduced legislation to recognise Jerusalem as Israelâ€ ™ s official capital and move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv , a plan backed by Donald Trump but likely to ignite fierce protests .
After being sworn into the 115th Congress in Washington , Ted Cruz of Texas , Dean Heller of Nevada and Marco Rubio of Florida unveiled the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act .
Similar moves by Republican majorities over the past two decades have come to nought , but this time they have a sympathetic president - elect in Trump .
He has repeatedly pledged to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem and nominated a US ambassador who shares that view .
Critics warn that the move could unleash a wave of violence and further rattle the Israel - Palestine peace process and the future of a two - state solution .
Cruz , runner - up to Trump in the Republican presidential primary , said on Tuesday : â€œJerusalem is the eternal and undivided capital of Israel .
Unfortunately , the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s vendetta against the Jewish state has been so vicious that to even utter this simple truth â€
“ let alone the reality that Jerusalem is the appropriate venue for the American embassy in Israel â€ “ is shocking in some circles .
â€œBut it is finally time to cut through the double - speak and broken promises and do what Congress said we should do in 1995 : formally move our embassy to the capital of our great ally Israel.â€
�
A statement from Heller said that some state department funds would be withheld until the embassy was relocated .
He said : â€œFor years , Iâ€ ™ ve advocated for Americaâ€ ™ s need to reaffirm its support for one of our nationâ€ ™ s strongest allies by recognising Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel .
â€œIt honors an important promise America made more than two decades ago but has yet to fulfill .
While administrations come and go , the lasting strength of our partnership with one of our strongest allies in the Middle East continues to endure .
Rubio added : â€œJerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel , and thatâ€ ™ s where Americaâ€ ™ s embassy belongs .
Itâ€ ™ s time for Congress and the president - elect to eliminate the loophole that has allowed presidents in both parties to ignore US law and delay our embassyâ€ ™ s rightful relocation to Jerusalem for over two decades.â€
�
The US embassy has been located on Tel Avivâ€ ™ s HaYarkon Street for half a century .
US state department policy has long held that the status of Jerusalem will only be determined in final talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
Although the US Congress passed a law ordering the move to Jerusalem in 1995 , every president since then has exercised a six - month waiver to prevent it taking place , usually citing â€œnational security concernsâ€ � .
Saeb Erekat , a senior Palestinian official and peace negotiator , warned last month that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would result in the â€œdestruction of the peace process as a wholeâ€ � .
But David Friedman , the pro - Israel hardliner Trump nominated as his ambassador to Israel , has said he looks forward to serving in Jerusalem .
Israelâ€ ™ s ambassador to the US has described the move of the embassy as a â€œgreat step forward to peaceâ€ � and something that â€œshould have happened a long time agoâ€ � .
Last month Obama angered Israel â€ “ and Trump â€ “ by allowing a UN security council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction to be adopted ."
2017-01-08,"The Texas senator Ted Cruz and governor , Greg Abbott , have met the Taiwanese president , Tsai Ing - wen , while she was passing through the state on her way to diplomatic stops in Central America .
Cruz said Chinaâ€ ™ s consulate had asked , in â€œa curious letterâ€ � , that the Houston congressional delegation â€œuphold the â€˜One China policyâ€ ™ â€ � and not meet the Taiwanese leader .
In December , Donald Trump spoke with Tsai by phone , breaking decades of US precedent in relations with China .
Cruz , a Republican who endorsed Trump after losing to him in the presidential primary , had previously defended Trumpâ€ ™ s call .
â€œThe Peopleâ€ ™ s
Republic of China needs to understand that in America we make decisions about meeting with visitors for ourselves , â€ �
Cruz said in a statement on Sunday .
â€œThis is not about the PRC [ Peopleâ€ ™ s Republic of China ] .
This is about the US relationship with Taiwan , an ally we are legally bound to defend .
The Chinese do not give us veto power over those with whom they meet .
We will continue to meet with anyone , including the Taiwanese , as we see fit.â€ �
Cruz said he and Tsai discussed â€œarms sales , diplomatic exchanges and economic relationsâ€ � , and that he hoped to increase trade between Texas and Taiwanese markets .
In a separate statement , Abbott said he and Tsai discussed agriculture and gas trade , and exchanged gifts .
Tsai received â€œa clock bearing the Texas state sealâ€ � , Abbott said , and the governor was given a vase .
Abbott said the issues discussed were energy , trade relations and commercial ties between Taiwan and Texas .
China said on Monday it opposed the Cruz - Tsai meeting , and a state - run newspaper warned of â€œrevengeâ€ � against Donald Trump should he abandon the One China policy .
â€œWe are firmly opposed to the Taiwan leaderâ€ ™ s engagement with US officials under the pretext of transit , and her attempt to undermine China - US relations , â€ � the foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular briefing .
He urged the US to abide by the One China policy and â€œprudently handleâ€ � Taiwan - related issues .
The Global Times newspaper said Beijing was â€œfully preparedâ€ � to break ties with the US should Trump abandon the policy .
â€œIf Trump reneges on the One China policy after taking office , the Chinese people will demand the government to take revenge .
There is no room for bargaining , â€ � said the paper , which often takes a nationalistic tone .
US politicians often meet Taiwanese presidents when they pass through the US , despite tensions between federal officials .
Tsai incurred Beijingâ€ ™ s anger over her refusal to endorse its policy that mainland China and Taiwan constitute a single nation .
Beijing lodged a complaint with the US over Trumpâ€ ™ s call with Tsai , the first between American and Taiwanese leaders since ties were cut in 1979 at Chinaâ€ ™ s request .
Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s White House reassured China , but Trump continued to threaten exacerbating tensions with Beijing .
Not long after his 10-minute conversation with Tsai , the president - elect railed against China on Twitter .
He wrote : â€œDid China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency ( making it hard for our companies to compete ) , heavily tax our products going into their country ( the US doesnâ€
™ t tax them ) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea ?
I donâ€
™ t think so!â€ �
He then accused China of stealing an underwater drone that it seized in contested waters , calling it an â€œunpresidented [ sic ] actâ€ � .
â€œWe should tell China that we donâ€ ™ t want the drone they stole back , â€ � he wrote .
â€œLet them keep it!â€ �"
2017-02-07,"Cory Bernardi may be just the latest in a growing line of chancers to jump on the global wave of reactionary , rightwing populism
but , for Malcolm Turnbull , he is a one - man existential crisis .
Well - versed in the basics of US - grown God - fearing , flag - waving , science - trashing individualism , although more Ted Cruz than Donald Trump in orientation , Bernardiâ€ ™ s defection from the Coalition seems calculated to tap the zeitgeist .
And just as Trump ripped the Republican party in two through the primaries , the local environment is ripe for a similar schism in the Australian right .
Paralysed between the pressures of his conservative base and his libertarian instincts , the prime minister is leading a government in name only , with an agenda limited to pushing through corporate tax cuts , fighting culture wars and holding back the tide on renewable energy .
This is reflected in terrible polling numbers in the new year , which continued in this weekâ€ ™ s Essential Report .
Turnbull has already been absorbing pressure from the restless Tony Abbott , the bombastic George Christensen and the spectre of a resurgent One Nation party , all of whom have the natural advantage in believing in their brand of populism .
And , to amplify the tensions , the Trump presidency rockets on its path of destruction , putting what used to be dismissed as crude slogans designed to fire up a base into actual , real - world , superpower policy .
Australian reaction to the Trump circus illustrates the challenges the Coalition government will face in the coming months .
While there are strong rejections of the Muslim ban by Labor and Green voters and predictably strong support from those already voting outside the major parties , it is the Coalition that is split down the middle .
Yes , itâ€ ™ s only one issue , but it goes to the heart of the cultural agenda of a conservative right which is itself is fragmenting in four different directions
â€ “ all drawing votes away from the Coalition .
The fragmentation of the right looks like this : Nationalist , regional populism â€ “
Pauline Hansonâ€
™ s One Nation already has 10 % of the national vote .
She is attracting defectors from the LNP in Queensland and is likely to win lower house seats there , creating a possible base for a new rightwing party with a footprint into New South Wales and Western Australia .
In terms of policy , there is also strong alignment with Jacqui Lambie in Tasmania .
Libertarian â€ “
Senator David Leyonhjelm , with about 3 % of the NSW vote , has now been elected to the Senate twice , importantly also under new voting system .
In contrast to One Nation he is not protectionist but a champion of small government and anti - regulation in outlook , a position endorsed and fomented by the high - profile corporate - funded Institute of Public Affairs .
Nick Xenophon Team â€ “ really centre - right , based regionally in South Australia but economically protectionist and shares that policy with Hanson .
While 70 % of Xenophonâ€ ™ s votes are coming from the Liberals , 57 % of his preferences are going to Labor .
He has won a federal seat off the Libs and went close in two others .
Will win several seats in SA election on current numbers .
Into this mix comes Bernardiâ€ ™ s
Christian right â€ “ with a still - to - be - defined mix of moral majority
meets Family First .
He also has the assets of wealthy backers and the Conservative party name .
The big question will be if others are prepared to follow him or if he is isolated as the â€œmouth of the ( Australian )
southâ€ � .
Even a prime minister with strong public support and a proven ability to manage internal stakeholders would be challenged by this rag - bag of self - styled outsiders .
No matter the issue , the base is vulnerable .
Moral issues will split the vote , libertarian issues will split the vote , economic issues will split the vote further , corporate support in tax cuts will split the vote .
Meanwhile , the dynamics of Trump will keep foreign policy issues and immigration , refugees and race on the agenda , putting Turnbull under constant pressure to go â€œharderâ€ � on national security to stifle dissent on the right but at the cost of his personal standing and brand .
What is Turnbull left with as a set of policies that can unify the conservative side of politics ?
To paraphrase John Howard : the things that divide the conservatives are now greater than the things that unite them .
The one hope for Turnbull is that Bernardi and the other populists putting themselves forward as individuals who can rise above the system is that they may have left their run too late .
With Trump in power we can now see first - hand what actually happens when an individual asserts control of a political culture , whipping up panics , turning his back on evidence - based policies , winging it with only the megaphone of power .
If Trump somehow delivers succour and security to the dispossessed without actually sending the US and the world over the edge , then two - party states around the world will face a deepening crisis of mission .
But if , as appears more likely , he is exposed as an incompetent phoney whose shortcomings cost lives then the idea of a professional political class may well have a renaissance as we seek stability in a fractured world .
In short , the question that both Turnbull and Bernardi are staking their future on is : will Trump - ism spark a wave of rightwing populism or will it defeat it ?"
2017-02-19,"Far - right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos has been revealed as a speaker at next weekâ€ ™ s influential Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) to give his message at a time when â€œpolitical correctness is properly being discardedâ€ � , said its organiser .
The Breitbart news editor , who was permanently banned from Twitter in July 2016 for instigating racist and sexist abuse of Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones , will take the stage alongside other speakers including US vice - president Mike Pence and Senator Ted Cruz .
Matt Schlapp , the chairman of the organiser American Conservative Union ( ACU ) , said he thought the conservative movement could handle the controversy sparked by the invitation of the notorious internet troll and noted that â€œACU has publicly taken on racism and the alt - right and will continue to do so
aggressivelyâ€ � .
Seventy - five speakers have so far been announced for the annual gathering of conservative organisations in Washington , which begins on Wednesday .
The keynote speaker will be Michael Reagan , the eldest child of former president Ronald Reagan .
On Friday night , Yiannopoulos appeared on HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher and insulted comics Lena Dunham , Leslie Jones , Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman .
He said : â€œThe Democrats are the party of Lena Dunham .
These people are hideous , mental people .
The more the American people see of Lena Dunham , the fewer votes the Democratic party is going to get.â€ �
Yiannopoulos added that Schumer and Silverman â€œused to be funny before they contracted feminismâ€
� .
One the abuse of Leslie Jones that saw him banned from Twitter , he said : â€œI simply donâ€
™ t accept that an A - list Hollywood celebrity is sitting at home crying over mean words on the internet.â€ �
Maher , a free speech advocate , told Yiannopoulos he thought he was â€œcolossally wrongâ€ � on most issues The show was followed by an expletive - ridden online segment with three panellists : comedian Larry Wilmore , author and counterterrorism expert Malcolm Nance and Georgia Republican Jack Kingston .
This month the University of California , Berkeley had to cancel a speech by Yiannopoulos after thousands of students gathered in protest and a group of black - clad activists shot fireworks at the speech venue .
US president Donald Trump later criticised the universityâ€ ™ s stance on free speech and brought into question the institutionâ€ ™ s federal funding .

2017-03-01,"After his presidential address on Tuesday , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s expressed hope that â€œRepublicans and Democrats can work togetherâ€ � to fix Americaâ€ ™ s immigration system wasnâ€ ™ t exactly reflected among members of Congress .
In Sanctuary Hall after the speech , Republicans applauded Trumpâ€ ™ s statements , but Democrats saw little common ground .
Texas senator Ted Cruz praised Trump for paying tribute to those whose families had been killed by undocumented immigrants and heaped praise on his efforts to beef up enforcement on the southern border .
Iowa representative Steve King , also a Republican , applauded Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks and noted that family members of several people killed by undocumented immigrants were presidential guests on Tuesday .
However , King did strike one word of warning about reports that Trump was considering a path to legal status for so - called Dreamers , undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children and have spent their entire lives in the country .
King , a vocal immigration hawk , said : â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s promise was to end that program and to bring back the rule of law.â€ �
But of the list of campaign promises that Trump has been keeping , King presumes the president just â€œhasnâ€ ™ t gotten to that one yetâ€ � .
On the other side of the immigration debate within the Republican party , House majority leader Kevin McCarthy struck a cautious note on the presidentâ€ ™ s call to reform legal immigration .
Trumpâ€ ™ s embrace of a merit - based system , which has been echoed in proposals by some Republican senators , met some hesitation from McCarthy .
â€œI firmly believe in legal immigration , â€ � said the California Republican , who has enthusiastically embraced Trump .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re a country of immigrants and we want to make sure it stays a country of immigrants.â€ �
For their part , Democrats said they doubted his openness to grant legal status to immigrants , especially following a series of controversial executive orders to clamp down on illegal immigration .
Senator Kamala Harris of California said she was â€œconcerned and a bit
disturbedâ€
� by Trumpâ€ ™ s commentary on immigrants .
Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas said Trumpâ€ ™ s speech was filled with â€œdark and divisive themesâ€ � that scapegoated the immigrant community .
Representative Brad Sherman of California said the examples of immigrants Trump highlighted in his speech were unrepresentative of the undocumented population , which is estimated to be 11 million people .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re talking about 11 million undocumented people who live among us who are a critical part of our society and he wants to identify three or four terrible instances as if thatâ€ ™ s the picture , â€ � Sherman said .
â€œWhat if I created a division of the Justice Department just to collect stories of people who had been brutally murdered by folks with bad toupees ?
Would that be fair to our president?â€ �"
2017-03-08,"The Republicansâ€ ™ replacement for Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s Affordable Care Act faced skepticism from both the left and the right on Wednesday , as Democrats deployed delaying tactics to try to slow the bill and another GOP senator expressed pessimism about its chances of passing without changes .
Ted Cruz , the Texas senator who clashed with Donald Trump last year when both were running for the Republican nomination but eventually endorsed him , told reporters : â€œAs drafted , I do not believe this bill would pass the United States Senate.â€ � Cruz and his wife , Heidi , were scheduled to have dinner with Trump at the White House on Wednesday night .
Many conservatives view the legislation as â€œObamacare liteâ€ � and a continuation of what they see as the big government excesses of the last presidentâ€ ™ s Affordable Care Act .
On Wednesday , the American Health Care Act also came under fire from the left , as congressional hearings on the bill began .
Democrats , who do not have the votes to stop the repeal without Republicans , are using stalling tactics to slow the debate over the bill â€ “ perhaps even delay a committee vote until the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) can deliver its verdict on the costs of the scheme and its effects on insurance coverage .
Representative Ben LujÃ¡n , a Democrat from New Mexico , said they would push to extend the hearing for â€œas long as it takes to ask important questionsâ€ � .
He would not say if Democrats were aiming to slow - walk the hearing until a score was announced by the CBO , a non - partisan legislative office that assesses the impact and cost of the legislation .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ll see what our Republican colleagues determine to do .
Donâ€ ™ t forget that in 2010 Chairman Walden led an effort â€ ¦ that demanded that the bill be posted for 72 hours before it was voted on , â€ � he said .
â€œThe Republicans have given us 40 hours before this bill is up today.â€ �
Before entering the hearing room to resume debate , LujÃ¡n took a selfie with an artist wearing a shirt that said â€œCBO
score??â€ �
Richard Neal of Massachusetts , the ranking Democrat on the House ways and means committee , insisted that â€œto consider a bill of this magnitude without a CBO score is not only puzzling and disconcerting but irresponsibleâ€ � .
Sander Levin of Michigan described holding hearings on the bill before the score was released publicly as â€œa sneak attackâ€ � on the American public .
The CBO verdict , the best estimate of winners and losers from the proposed legislation , is expected on Monday .
Meanwhile , amid raucous scenes in the House energy and commerce committee , which is also examining the legislation , Democrats insisted on the 123-page bill being read in full , a process that took an hour and ended with a round of applause .
â€œFor seven years Republicans claimed to have a better way , â€ �
Frank Pallone , a Democrat from New Jersey , said in his opening remarks to the committee .
â€œBut it turns out that is nothing more than an empty slogan .
After seven years of sabotaging and obstructing the ACA , Republicans have finally presented a repeal bill â€ “ less than two days ago â€ “ and it is incredibly destructive to the little guy.â€ �
He said the Democrats would table â€œabout 100â€ � amendments .
Republicans focused their fire on the current healthcare law , with some expressing optimism that any shortcomings in the replacement proposal would be ironed out during the current committee process .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s first be clear why weâ€ ™
re here : Obamacare has failed the American people , â€ � said Steve Scalise , the House majority whip .
In the ways and means committee , which made slightly more progress in the first few hours of the hearing , debate became testy over a provision allowing health insurance companies to write off as a business expense the entire amount of their executivesâ€ ™ salaries on their taxes , and not just the first $ 500,000 , as is the case now under the Affordable Care Act .
No Republicans spoke up as Democrats railed against the provision , which would cost taxpayers an estimated $ 400 m over the next 10 years .
Lloyd Doggett of Texas deplored the fact that â€œno member of the insurance industry had the courage to comeâ€ � to testify in favor of the provision .
Democrats on the committee spent much of the afternoon alternating between railing against Trumpâ€ ™ s foreign ties and offering trolling amendments to place Republicans in awkward positions .
Representative Joe Crowley of New York offered an amendment that required every member to state if they had read the bill in its entirety .
The same amendment had previously been proposed word for word by Kevin Brady , the current Republican chair of the ways and means committee , during the debate on Obamacare .
The amendment failed on a party line vote .
Under House procedure , the energy and commerce committee deals with elements of the AHCA relating to Medicaid while the ways and means committee discusses the legislationâ€ ™ s tax aspects .
The bill would eliminate the individual mandate , which required Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine ; cut the number of people insured under Medicaid ; and allow insurance companies to charge the elderly up to five times more than the young .
It would require insurers to cover so - called pre - existing conditions , but would allow them to add a 30 % surcharge to premiums if people go without insurance for too long . Non - partisan outside groups such as the AARP senior citizensâ€ ™ lobby group and the American Medical Association have come out against the legislation .
Donald Trump has called the bill â€œwonderfulâ€ � but said it was â€œout for review and negotiationâ€ � , and officials , such as the health secretary , Tom Price , have called it â€œa work in progressâ€ � .
Trump met late on Wednesday at the White House with leaders of influential conservative groups that came out early against the bill , including the Heritage Foundation , Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity .
Attendees ignored questions shouted by the press as they exited the White House .
â€œI was encouraged because he was listening , â€ � the Club for Growth president , David McIntosh , later said on Fox News , referring to the president .
But Republican leaders have stood firm in defending it , with the House speaker , Paul Ryan , the most senior Republican in Congress , insisting to reporters on Wednesday morning : â€œThis is what good , conservative healthcare reform looks like.â€ �"
2017-03-24,"Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s elastic connection to reality was richly on display in his interview with Time magazine , published on Thursday .
Much of what the president said was unsurprising â€ “ that is , to those who have spent the past two months radically recalibrating their standards of what counts as presidential speech .
Devoted to the topic of â€œtruth and falsehoodsâ€ � , the interview gave the president a chance to substantiate or explain his most offensive deformations of the factual record â€ “ that Muslims danced in the streets of the New Jersey as the Twin Towers crumbled , that 3 million undocumented aliens threw the popular vote in Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s favor , that Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father trucked with Lee Harvey Oswald , and that Barack Obama tapped the phone of then candidate Trump .
Predictably , the president offered nothing in the way of substantiation or contrition .
Instead , he overwhelmed his interviewer with such a profusion of misstatements , half - truths , dodges and red herrings that one grows dizzy trying to untangle it all .
Our first impulse might be to run this verbal stew through a fact - checking rinse .
But as Spinoza once said about scripture , sometimes itâ€ ™ s better to study a text for its meaning , not its truth .
In this regard , the Time interview is a particularly helpful document , as it provides unusual insight into the principles and deep structure of Trumpspeak , the untethered political discourse presently distorting our democracy .
What follows is an informal inventory of the most revealing quotes :
â€œI didnâ€ ™ t say that .
I was referring to ... a newspaper story with â€ ¦ a picture of Ted Cruz , his father , and Lee Harvey Oswald , having breakfast.â€ �
In Trumpspeak , a speaker can never be accused of lying if heâ€ ™ s simply repeating the statements of others ; it is the responsibility of those who make original claims to check for the accuracy and truthfulness of their assertions , not the person who repeats them â€ “ even if that person happens to be the most powerful person and speaker on the planet .
2 â€œBut wiretapping was in quotes.â€ �
Trumpspeak is figurative .
It lives in quotation marks .
This is not only because Trumpspeak works by repeating the statements of others ( see point 1 ) , but because it is gestural , performative .
Trumpspeak is unscripted ; words cascade forth only to be rearranged and endlessly massaged to say whatever is needed in the moment .
3 . â€œSweden .
I make a statement , everyone goes crazy .
The next day they have a massive riot , and death , and problems.â€
�
In Trumpspeak , truth is not factual ,
itâ€ ™ s imagistic ( this is related to point 2 ) .
Truthful statements do not necessarily offer an accurate account of events in the world .
They provide an approximation or exaggeration of something that might , in theory , have occurred .
Whether a terror attack in Sweden ever took place on the night named by the president is irrelevant .
Nor should we care that the riot was not massive and there was no death .
Close and maybe are good enough .
4 .
â€œRemember
they said there was no way to get to 270 ?
Well I ended up at 306.â€ �
Trumpspeak confuses prophecy with honesty .
The president accurately predicted his electoral victory and therefore must be a man of his word .
Conversely , if a news organization failed to correctly anticipate the presidentâ€ ™ s win at the polls , Trumpspeak treats this as evidence of the falsity and mendacity of that organizationâ€ ™ s reportage about all of reality .
5 .
â€œThe country believes me.â€ �
In Trumpspeak , belief is a signal of truth .
If his supporters believe him , then what Trump is saying must be true .
Conversely , if his detractors disbelieve him , this too is evidence that what he is saying must be true .
In Trumpspeak , detractors claim Trump is a liar because they are his detractors ; and in calling Trump a liar , they in fact are lying .
6 . â€œIâ€ ™ m president , and youâ€ ™ re not.â€ �
Finally , Trumpspeak is transactional .
It places no independent value on truth .
The value of speech is to be measured exclusively in terms of its effects .
If a statement gets me closer to my goal , then it is valuable ; if it does not , it is worthless .
Valuable statements , then , are true by virtue of the fact that they advance my interests .
Statements that fail to do so are worthless and thus false .
I was elected president , so that means that every statement that got me here has validity .
This does not claim to be an exhaustive list of the principles of Trumpspeak .
Nor do I mean to suggest that Trumpspeak is a conscious construct of the president .
In the Time interview , Trump describes himself as a â€œvery instinctual personâ€ � , and however we parse this obscure characterization of self , we should acknowledge the presidentâ€ ™ s peculiar gift at concocting verbal mayhem ."
2017-05-26,"In the fourth season of House of Cards , President Frank Underwood chose his wife as vice - presidential running mate while stretching the US constitution to breaking point by trying to derail an investigation into what newspapers called his â€œcrooked path to the White House.â€ �
Some viewers felt that , while enjoyable as TV drama , the scale of nepotism and corruption in the presidency of Kevin Spaceyâ€ ™ s character was becoming politically unrealistic .
But that was last March , when the consensus , after the Super Tuesday primaries , was that Senator Ted Cruz would easily see off the maverick insurgency of Donald Trump to gain the Republican nomination and then , in all probability , lose the White House race to Hillary Clinton .
Now , the risk â€ “ when the fifth season is released on Netflix on Tuesday â€ “ is that the deranged chaos of the Underwood White House will seem tame in comparison to the Trump administration .
Speaking this week on the NBC show Late Night with Seth Meyers , Spacey acknowledged that the context of the show had changed .
Referring to the way Underwood reached the Oval Office , the actor said : â€œWhatâ€ ™ s interesting is that there are people who watch the show ... and thought , â€˜Oh thatâ€ ™ s crazy .
That could never happen.â€ ™
And then suddenly 18 months later itâ€ ™ s like , â€˜Oh , wait a second .
That actually could happen.â€ ™
Or it is happening.â€
�
Netflix is protecting the content of the fifth season with a successful non - leak strategy that would be the envy of politicians everywhere .
But the trailer for the forthcoming series seems to show the Underwoods winning the 2016 election on their joint ticket , as well as the president using physical violence against senators and other opponents in what appears to be a crackdown on dissent and possibly democracy itself .
Some of the hinted at storylines look impressively prophetic .
Seeing protestors outside the White House holding signs that declare him unfit for office , Underwood has a Trumpian tantrum , raging : â€œThe American people donâ€ ™ t know whatâ€ ™ s good for them.â€ � The trailer suggests a leader who will use any means to gain and maintain power .
This isnâ€ ™ t the first time the House of Cards franchise has got unnervingly close to real politics .
The Netflix show is an Americanised expansion of a BBC series of the same name â€ “ adapted by Andrew Davies from the novel by Michael Dobbs â€ “ which began with Margaret Thatcher being forced out of power and replaced by Francis Urquhart , played by Ian Richardson .
( The protagonists of both versions have the deliberately antagonistic initials FU . )
The series first aired on 18 November 1990 , four days after Thatcher resigned the premiership under pressure from cabinet colleagues .
But , though the Underwood - Trump blurring may prove an advantage to House of Cards , in another sense the new series has been overtaken by American political history before it begins .
Last yearâ€ ™
s
increasing emphasis on the ambition of Claire Underwood ( Robin Wright ) to become president in succession to her husband seemed to be a clear preparation for season five to shadow and satirise the presumed Clinton presidency .
( This yearâ€ ™ s season of Homeland also lost a gamble on mirroring a female commander - in - chief . )
Fictional and factual presidential cycles have not generally synchronised on US TV , though .
Martin Sheenâ€ ™ s President Jed Bartlet in The West Wing ( 1999 - 2006 ) was a super - liberal super - intellectual , but the showâ€ ™ s last five seasons coincided with the incumbency of a commander - in - chief widely seen as an illiberal ignoramus , George W Bush .
And the first four years of Netflixâ€ ™ s House of Cards ran the completely amoral Underwood â€ “ a liar and murderer with a multiply dysfunctional marriage â€ “ against the fiercely moral Barack Obama and Michelle Obama , one of the most admired first ladies in history .
The challenge for House of Cards now is whether its depiction of a preposterously exaggerated president will work as a comically cathartic commentary on Trump or may seem dull and understated in comparison to the nightly news bulletins .
Perhaps the best thing that could happen to the show is for President Trump to watch it and tweet about how unrealistic the whole thing is .
House of Cards season five is on Netflix from 30 May."
2017-06-11,"Al Frankenâ€ ™ s new memoir , Al Franken , Giant of the Senate , covers everything from his 15 years as a writer and performer on Saturday Night Live to the near - death experience of his first run for the Senate from Minnesota ( after a recount , he won by 312 votes , out of 2.9 million cast ) .
In between , we learn that a TV ad with his fourth grade teacher and another in which his wife described her battle against alcoholism turned the tide in that campaign ; how his fellow senators feel about Ted Cruz ( â€œI like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues ... and I hate Ted Cruzâ€ � ) ; and about one of his biggest fears about our new president ( â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to spend some portion of our time trying to prevent him from giving Alaska back to the Russiansâ€ � ) .
It turns out that Frankenâ€ ™ s background as a comedian actually turned him into a deep policy wonk , because he was so determined to convince the voters of Minnesota that he could be serious enough to do this job .
â€œLike
Trump , I had no previous experience in elected office .
Unlike Trump , I was actually bothered by my lack of experience .
I compensated for this by absorbing as much information in as much detail as I could.â€ �
So there is a surprising amount of detail here about how he tried to improve dental care for Native American children , and passed an amendment to the defense appropriations bill to fund a study to prove the usefulness of service dogs to veterans suffering from post - traumatic stress .
( Nine years after the billâ€ ™ s passage , the study is still not quite finished . )
Frankenâ€ ™ s interest in pursuing a political career began with the success of his earlier books Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Lies and the Lying Liars
Who Tell Them :
A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right .
What bothers him most today is something that is at the heart of our political dilemma : â€œWe seem to have entered an era where getting caught lying openly and shamelessly , lying in a manner that insults the intelligence of both your friends and foes , lying about lying , and lying for the sake of lying have all lost their power to damage a politician.â€ �
In fact , among Trumpâ€ ™ s core supporters , the effect is even worse : they â€œseem to feel that he is making the dull reality of politics more fun and interesting by augmenting it with gross exaggeration , and often utter fantasy ...
During the campaign , Trump would give speeches that would just be one lie after another ... and the media would just air these speeches in their entirety.â€ �
Way back in 1992 , when Franken did TV specials about the national political conventions featuring the likes of Christopher Hitchens and Roger Ailes , he realized the value comedy has in explaining politics to the average voter .
Today of course , there is no longer anything strange about that idea at all : â€œJon Stewart and Stephen Colbert became not just successful comedians , but respected political figures , â€ �
Franken explains .
And anyone who watches Colbert or Trevor Noah every night will actually learn many more important political facts than are ever shared on the CBS , NBC or ABC nightly news shows .
Franken is an old - fashioned Democrat , whose Jewish parents instructed him in the importance of supporting the civil rights movement .
His main political inspiration is the late Paul Wellstone , a progressive Minnesota senator who died in a plane crash in 2002 .
Franken has a surprisingly complex view of many of his Senate colleagues .
He manages to enjoy the company of both Mitch McConnell and Jeff Sessions , even as he excoriates the former for spending eight years trying to destroy Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s presidency , and takes fierce pride in his vote against Sessions to become attorney general , because he is obviously a â€œclear and present danger to the civil rights of millions of Americansâ€ � .
Franken has no doubt about how we ended up with the current catastrophe in the White House .
â€œI firmly believe that you can draw a straight line from Rush Limbaugh through Fox News through present - day websites like Breitbart and the explosion in â€˜fake newsâ€ ™ that played such a big role in the 2016 campaign .
And thatâ€ ™ s how someone like Trumpâ€ � got elected .
[ 375 ] â€œI really think that if we donâ€ ™ t start caring about whether people tell the truth or not , itâ€ ™ s going to be literally impossible to restore anything appoaching a reasonable political discourse ...
If you can say something that is provably false , and no one cares , then you canâ€ ™ t have a real debate about anything , â€ � he writes .
Despite his disgust at the current state of politics in Washington , hemanages to remain hopeful about the future .
â€œMy story ... is a small part of a bigger story â€ “ the story of how progressives picked themselves up off the mat and made an epic comebackâ€
� by taking back Congress and electing Barack Obama eight and a half years ago .
â€œAnd now we have to do it
again.â€ �"
2017-07-06,"At a town hall in Pennsylvania on Wednesday night , the Republican senator Pat Toomey faced an angry protest over his role in the GOP healthcare bill , while Ted Cruz was heckled over his suggested amendment to the legislation at an event in Texas .
Scores of people gathered outside the ABC27 studio in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , where Toomey was holding what had been billed as a town hall meeting .
But in reality just eight audience members were allowed into the invite - only event , and their questions had been pre - screened by the news channel .
The closed - door approach did not endear Toomey to the sign - waving protesters outside , who accused the senator of not â€œhaving courage to speak to people who would be personally affectedâ€ � by the Senate healthcare legislation he helped to write .
Cruz , meanwhile , was heckled at what in theory should have been a safe event :
a ticket - only town hall discussion hosted by Concerned Veterans for America ( CVA ) â€ “ a rightwing advocacy group financed by the Koch brothers .
Audience questions for Cruz at the event in McKinney , north of Dallas , had been screened in advance by the CVA , but two audience members went rogue to quiz and interrupt the Texas senator over his proposed tweak to the Senate bill .
The Better Care Reconciliation Act , which the Congressional Budget Office says would leave an additional 22 m people without healthcare , is currently stuck in the Senate without enough votes to pass .
Cruzâ€ ™ s amendment would allow insurance companies to sell plans that do not include the Affordable Care Act ( ACA)-mandated â€œessential health benefitsâ€
� , in a move he claims would reduce costs .
At the town hall , however , Cruzâ€ ™ s adversaries repeatedly shouted him down as he attempted to defend his measure .
â€œWhen you mandate what every policy has to cover you driveâ€ � up the cost of insurance , Cruz said , which means fewer people can afford healthcare .
The essential health benefits also made people pay for coverage â€œthat they donâ€ ™ t necessarily
wantâ€ � , he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s all fine and good to mandate that everybody get coverage for everything at all times , but what happens in practice is the prices go so high that people are left out in the cold.â€ � Some 1,300 miles to the north - east , Toomey was being given a much easier ride from the eight attendees at his town hall .
The majority of the questions from that crowd , as well as from small groups of people invited into the studios of three other ABC affiliates in Pennsylvania , focussed on healthcare , but there was no heckling and no follow - up questioning .
Asked about the damaging CBO score , Toomey accused the organization of bias and said that its calculations were based on â€œwildly speculative assumptions that I think are extremely unlikely to come to passâ€ � .
Toomey denied that the process of drafting the bill â€ “ without public hearings â€ “ had been overly secretive , but was non - committal over whether he supported repealing the ACA without a replacement .
The senator was asked the question twice , both times saying that he believed the scenario was â€œunlikelyâ€ � .
â€œI
just donâ€
™ t think there are enough votes in the Senate to pass that , â€ � Toomey said .
â€œI
just donâ€
™ t think itâ€ ™ s going to come to pass.â€ �
Meanwhile , outside the studio , about a hundred people noisily protested both the senatorâ€ ™ s role in the unpopular healthcare bill and his refusal to hold a truly public event .
â€œWe want Toomey to come home on his recess and actually speak with constituents , instead of doing telephone town halls or televised town halls where he doesnâ€ ™ t have to interact with the people
heâ€
™ s supposed to be representing , â€ � said Katey Dyck , who travelled two hours from her home in Fort Washington , just north of Philadelphia , to attend the protest .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s dismantling our healthcare system without having the courage to speak to people
who would be personally affected.â€ �
Dyck travelled to Harrisburg with her two children and two friends , one of whom , Alison Fraser , was arrested after staging a sit - in at Toomeyâ€ ™ s Washington DC office last week .
â€œThere are issues with the ACA .
There are things they can do to bring down costs , â€ � Fraser said .
â€œBut they canâ€ ™ t just dismantle this bill that has really done so much to protect people , and make sure people arenâ€ ™ t discriminated against because of pre - existing conditions.â€ �
Also among the protesters was Josh Burkholder , a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for US congress in Pennsylvaniaâ€ ™ s fourth district last November .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re giving a huge tax break to the 1 % here , â€ � Burkholder said , also by phone , of the Senate legislation .
â€œItâ€ ™ s just awful .
Making a giant tax break for the ultra rich while simultaneously pulling the rug out from under the poor of the country is just disgusting.â€
�
The majority of Senate Republicans have so far ducked interactions with the public during recess week
â€ “ supposedly a time for elected officials to return to their districts and meet with constituents .
The Washington Post reported that just four GOP senators planned to attend Fourth of July parades , while only three â€ “ Cruz , Bill Cassidy from Louisiana and Jerry Moran from Kansas â€ “ are scheduled to hold public town halls .
Cruz and Moran are openly opposed to the Senate bill while Cassidy has said he is â€œconcernedâ€ � and has put forward an alternative to the plan ."
2017-07-23,"Rand Paul , one of the conservative senators who has helped to hold up Republican healthcare reform , on Sunday derided the current Senate bill as a â€œmonstrosityâ€ � and a â€œporkfestâ€ � and said he would not vote for it to proceed to debate this week .
With Donald Trump telling senators to stay in Washington until they have a replacement for Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , Mitch McConnell is reportedly looking to hold a vote to proceed to debate as early as Tuesday .
The Senate majority leader must attempt to win over conservatives such as Paul , of Kentucky , Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah , who oppose government intervention in the insurance market .
Moderates such as Susan Collins of Maine have expressed opposition to the bill in terms of its $ 800bn cuts to Medicaid , the government programme that supports the young , elderly , poor and infirm .
â€œThe real question is what are we moving to , what are we opening to debate to , â€ � said Paul on CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union .
â€œLast week the Senate leadership said it would be a clean repeal , like the 2015 bill that we all voted for , and I think thatâ€ ™ s a good idea.â€ � Obama vetoed the 2015 repeal , one of a succession of attempts by Republicans in Congress to bring down his signature legislative achievement .
Trump , eager for legislative success after six months in office without it , first said this week that the ACA should be repealed before a replacement was ready ; then said it should simply be allowed to fail ; then demanded a replacement at the same time as a repeal .
Paul continued : â€œThe alternative is the Senate leadership bill that doesnâ€ ™ t repeal Obamacare , is Obamacare - lite and is loaded with pork ;
itâ€ ™ s become a porkfest where theyâ€ ™ re dumping billions of dollars into pet projects for individual senators .
Iâ€ ™ m not for that .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve told them I will vote for a motion to proceed if we proceed to a clean repeal vote .
If it fails they can put up their monstrosity that they want to put forward , but Iâ€ ™ m not for that because Iâ€ ™ m not for the taxpayer subsidising private industry.â€ � Speaking to CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation , Collins said uncertainty over what would be voted on this week was not â€œa good approach to facing legislation that affects millions of people and one sixth of our economyâ€ � .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this week that repeal of the ACA without a replacement would lead to 32 m Americans losing health insurance in the next decade .
The CBO score on the Senate healthcare bill put that figure at 22 m .
Republican healthcare proposals remain extremely unpopular with the voting public .
On Friday , the Senate parliamentarian threw another obstacle in the Republicansâ€ ™ way .
The chief rules adviser to the upper chamber said several provisions of the bill including the defunding of Planned Parenthood were not eligible for the 51-vote threshold of the budget reconciliation process and would have to attract 60 votes to pass .
The 48 Senate Democrats are united in their opposition to Republican attempts to repeal the ACA .
On Saturday , Trump included healthcare in a sequence of 10 morning tweets , writing : â€œThe Republican senators must step up to the plate and , after seven years , vote to repeal and replace .
Next , tax reform and infrastructure .
WIN !
â€œObamacare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists , no ideas or votes , only obstruction .
It is solely up to the 52 Republican senators!â€ �
He then included healthcare in a speech to a military audience in Norfolk , Virginia , marking the launch of the USS Gerald R Ford , a new nuclear - powered aircraft carrier .
â€œYou can â€ ¦ call those senators to make sure you get healthcare , â€ � the president said , a political remark that some observers deemed inappropriate .
Ben Rhodes , a former senior adviser to Obama , tweeted that Trumpâ€ ™ s words were â€œa huge deal .
Obama ( or Bushes ) never would have done this .
Violates most fundamental norms separating military and politics.â€

â€œThe president is committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare , â€ � said Sarah Huckabee Sanders , the new White House press secretary , on Sunday on ABCâ€ ™ s This Week .
â€œInaction is not an option and the president was making that clear yesterday and speaking not just to the people in the room but to the American people.â€ �
On CBS , White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was asked if Trumpâ€ ™ s mixed messaging on healthcare could damage the Republican push for reform .
Trumpâ€ ™ s contradictory tweets , Scaramucci said , showed the president â€œsignaling over the top of the mainstream mediaâ€ � .
â€œHe basically wants to repeal and replace Obamacare , â€ � he said .
â€œHe knows thatâ€ ™ s the best thing for the American people .
It turns out that he may not be able to get that done with a recalcitrant Congress.â€ �"
2017-09-12,"Texas senator Ted Cruz has been asked to explain himself after his official account â€œlikedâ€ � a pornographic tweet .
Although liking a Twitter post does not necessarily share it , the tweet became available to view on Cruzâ€ ™ s verified profile , leading to series of awkward screenshots .
Catherine Frazier , Cruzâ€ ™ s senior communications adviser , said â€œthe offensive tweet posted on @tedcruz account earlier has been removed by staff and reported to Twitterâ€ � .
But this added to confusion about what had happened , because the like was not a tweet and Frazierâ€ ™ s statement implied that it was made by someone who should not have had access to Cruzâ€ ™ s account .
Cruz joked to reporters on Tuesday that â€œperhaps we should have done something like this during the Indiana primaryâ€ � .
Cruz finished second to Donald Trump in that stateâ€ ™ s presidential primary , ultimately dooming his presidential campaign , which long suffered from the constant media attention enjoyed by Trump .
The Texas senator went on to add â€œthere are a number of people on the team that have access to the account and it appears that someone inadvertently hit the like buttonâ€ � .
When asked if Cruz himself had liked the tweet , he said said : â€œIt was a staffing issue , and it was inadvertent , it was a mistake , it was not a deliberate action.â€
�
The mishap was particularly awkward due to Cruzâ€ ™ s
support of conservative family values and his involvement in a court case in Texas about banning the use of sex toys .
In 2007 , when he was Texasâ€ ™ s solicitor general , two sex toy companies sued to overturn the stateâ€ ™ s ban on the sale of so - called marital aids .
The state defended the ban in submissions partly written by Cruzâ€ ™ s office , which argued : There is no substantive due process right to stimulate oneâ€ ™ s genitals for non - medical purposes unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship .
The US supreme court subsequently found that there was no validity to the state interfering in the sex lives of consenting adults .
The liking of the pornographic post helped resurface a 2016 tweet from the TV producer Craig Mazin , in which he said he shared a room with Cruz and his beliefs about genital stimulation were rather different to those expressed in the state argument .
Twitter users made jokes about the incident based on clips of the pornographic video liked by Cruzâ€ ™ s account .
The timing of the incident , on the anniversary of September 11 , also elicited comments .
Cruz has been a frequent subject of mockery on social media and repeatedly named in a conspiracy theory that he is the Zodiac killer , which was also referenced in relation to the Twitter like ."
2017-09-24,"The Trump administrationâ€ ™ s latest efforts to replace the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) appeared to be disintegrating over the weekend , as a growing number of Republican senators indicated they would vote against the so - called Graham - Cassidy bill .
Maine Republican Susan Collins looked all but certain to oppose the bill , while Texas senator Ted Cruz also warned on Sunday he would not vote for the legislation in its current form , and said he believed Utah senator Mike Lee would follow his lead in opposing .
Republicans hold a slim 52 - 48 majority in the Senate , meaning they can only afford to lose two votes before the bill fails as all Democrats are expected to vote against .
John McCain of Arizona and Rand Paul of Kentucky have already said they will oppose the bill , meaning one more Republican â€œnoâ€ � will kill the legislation .
Only a 50 - 50 tie can be broken by vice - president Mike Pence .
Collins , who voted against previous efforts to repeal the ACA , popularly known as Obamacare , told CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union on Sunday it was â€œvery difficult for me to envision a scenario where I would end up voting for this billâ€ � .
The Maine senator said she was concerned the legislation would lead to â€œthe erosion of protections for people pre - existing conditionsâ€ � but was waiting for a final analysis from the Congressional Budget Office , which she expected on Monday , before making a definitive decision .
She said :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know whether the CBO analysis will have new information that will change where Iâ€ ™ m inclined to head.â€ �
Highlighting the spectrum of Republican opposition , Cruz said later in the day he was opposed to the bill as it did not deregulate the system enough .
â€œRight now they donâ€ ™ t have my vote and I donâ€
™ t think they have Mike Leeâ€ ™ s either
, â€ � he said , speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin .
â€œI want to be a yes , I want to get there because I think that Obamacare is a disaster .
But the price to getting there , I believe , is focusing on consumer freedom.â€ �
Cruz said he and Lee had presented edits to the billâ€ ™
s architects , South Carolinaâ€ ™ s Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana , but they were taken out of the bill within a day .
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , another who voted against the last effort to replace the ACA , has yet to declare a position .
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has been expected to bring the bill up for a vote before 30 September , as he looks to fulfil a seven - year Republican campaign promise .
Appearing on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press on Sunday , White House legislative director Marc Short said the vote would probably happen on Wednesday .
But Graham - Cassidy has prompted opposition across the political spectrum and in the healthcare sector .
On Saturday , the American Medical Association , the Federation of American Hospitals , Americaâ€ ™ s Health Insurance Plans and the BlueCross BlueShield Association issued a joint statement against it .
The groups said Graham - Cassidy would cause patients to lose important protections and undermine those with pre - existing conditions ; would implement â€œdramatic cutsâ€ � to Medicaid for vulnerable citizens ; would make coverage more expensive ; and contained â€œunworkableâ€ � timelines for implementation .
The statement read : â€œHealthcare is too important to get wrong .
Letâ€ ™ s take the time to get it right .
Letâ€ ™ s agree to find real , bipartisan solutions that make healthcare work for every American.â€
�
On Sunday , Short insisted pre - existing conditions were covered by the new bill , saying so four times on NBC .
On CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation , he said : â€œYouâ€ ™ re right that there is an ability for states to apply for a waiver .
But itâ€ ™ s conditional upon them showing how they will continue to make pre - existing conditions covered on an affordable basis .
Thereâ€ ™ s also federal dollars that are provided to help states to do
that.â€ � Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said that if the bill did fail in the Senate , the president would be open to negotiating with Democrats .
â€œTo the extent they [ Democrats ] are willing to come to the table and fix it , the president would always listen , â€ �
Mnuchin told CNN .
The White House still hopes that Graham - Cassidy can progress , indicating that it will concentrate efforts on swinging the vote of Paul .
Short told Fox News Sunday that the billâ€ ™
s provision to defund Planned Parenthood , the nonprofit that provides reproductive healthcare , should be enough to sway the senator , a staunch abortion opponent .
â€œIf Rand Paul is the final vote here , itâ€ ™ s hard to see how he can go to his support and say I had the chance to protect life [ and voted against],â€ �
Short said .
Paul appeared on NBC .
He indicated that his opposition to the bill centered around the proposed temporary block grants to the states that would replace Medicaid expansion funds contained in the ACA .
The proposal is a central building block in the bill and , according to numerous pieces of analysis , would significantly reduce federal healthcare funding , particularly for low - income Americans .
Nonetheless , Paul , a conservative libertarian , argued that the grants would not go far enough .
â€œI started my political career campaigning against Obamacare , â€ �
he said .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t in good conscience vote to keep it.â€
