2003-10-21,"The foreign secretary , Jack Straw , and two other European foreign ministers flew to Tehran last night expecting to secure a significant concession from the Iranian government in the diplomatic standoff over its alleged secret plan to build a nuclear bomb .
In a rare show of European unity , Mr Straw , Joschka Fischer , the German foreign minister , and Dominique de Villepin , his French counterpart , are scheduled to meet Iranian leaders today in a single mission .
Their main meeting is with Dr Hassan Rouhani , secretary of Iran 's supreme national security council .
European officials have gone to Tehran over the past fortnight to prepare the ground and there is optimism that Iranian leaders are prepared to give ground before an October 31 deadline .
Iranian officials indicated yesterday that an announcement would be made today clearing the way for an end to months of stalemate .
The compromise deal would require Iran to open its doors to intrusive inspections in return for access to civilian nuclear technology and fuel .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations watchdog on nuclear proliferation , is suspicious that Iran has embarked on a covert nuclear weapons programme and set the deadline for Iran to cooperate with IAEA inspectors .
Iran denies it is attempting to build a nuclear bomb .
The three foreign ministers were invited to Iran two weeks ago by the Iranian foreign ministry .
The three , in discussions among themselves over the past fortnight , decided they would only undertake such a high - profile visit if there was the chance of a positive outcome .
Mr Straw has invested an unusual amount of time in Iran since becoming foreign secretary two years ago .
This is his fifth visit .
He has persisted in spite of a cooling in the relationship over the past few months that has seen several attacks in which shots have been fired at the British embassy in Tehran .
Before leaving yesterday evening , Mr Straw said : "" Resolving the doubts surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme is of grave concern to the European Union and to the wider international community . ""
He added that the three ministers "" will be pressing on the Iranian authorities the urgent need for compliance with all the [ IAEA ] requirements "" .
The three are looking for a concession in at least one of three areas :
Iran agreeing to full cooperation with the IAEA ; Iran signing an additional protocol to the nuclear non - proliferation treaty that would allow IAEA inspectors to make surprise visits to Iranian sites ; and the suspension of Iran 's uranium enrichment programme , which the US and Europe claims is being undertaken in order to build a bomb .
In return , the three European foreign ministers will pledge to help Iran with an "" assured fuel supply "" with technical assistance in modernising its civil nuclear programme .
Agreeing to the deal will require Iran 's theocratic leadership to forsake the possibility of developing a nuclear deterrent , something favoured by the more hardline elements in the clerical establishment . ""
This will certainly infuriate the hardliners , "" said one Iranian analyst .
"" But Iran will benefit and so will Europe . ""
The powerful former president of Iran , Hashemi Rafsanjani , was quoted in Iranian newspapers as saying : "" We are involved in one of the most crucial moments for our country and a final decision should be made .
"" Iran 's supreme national security council met yesterday and consulted the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , to confirm Iran 's stance on the compromise arrangement .
A European diplomat told the Guardian that a compromise agreement had been reached but that important details would be discussed in today 's meetings .
"" It 's safe to say they would not be travelling here if there was not already substantial agreement . """
2013-06-11,"Iran 's battered reformists have thrown their weight behind Hassan Rouhani , a moderate cleric favouring openness and improved relations with the west , who has emerged as the dark horse candidate in Friday 's presidential election .
The former presidents Mohammad Khatami , seen as the leader of Iran 's reformist movement , and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani publicly endorsed Rouhani on Tuesday . ""
Bearing in mind my duty to the country and the fate of our honourable nation , I will give my vote to my esteemed brother Dr Rouhani , "" Khatami wrote .
"" I ask all , in particular the reformists and those who seek the dignity and elevation of the nation â€ ¦ to see Dr Rouhani 's candidacy as a suitable chance for their demands to be met . ""
The endorsement of Rouhani has revived hopes among reformers seeking to return to the forefront of Iranian politics after the domination of hardliners during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's eight - year presidency .
Last month as hundreds of hopefuls registered to stand for election , Khatami declined to run and declared support for Rafsanjani , who put his name forward but was disqualified on the grounds that he was too "" feeble "" to govern the country .
Critics said the decision against Rafsanjani 's candidacy was politically motivated and stemmed from his rift with Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Electoral officials also barred a close ally of Ahmadinejad , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei .
The president promised to take up Mashaei 's case with Khamenei but has since remained unusually quiet .
After Rafsanjani 's exclusion it was not clear whether reformists would unite behind another candidate , but it emerged later that Khatami and Rafsanjani were choosing between Rouhani and another moderate candidate , Mohammad Reza Aref .
On Monday Aref said he was withdrawing from the race at the request of Khatami , in what appeared to be a co - ordinated plan by reformers to avoid a split in the vote .
Unlike the reformists , Iran 's conservatives have so far failed to unite .
Of the other six candidates besides Rouhani and Aref , at least two identify themselves as independents .
Gholam - Ali Haddad - Adel , a so - called "" principlist "" , also quit the race this week but did not endorse a particular contender .
Tehran 's mayor , Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , is among the conservative candidates seen as having a good chance of winning or entering a runoff with Rouhani .
The 65-year - old Rouhani is a former chief nuclear negotiator who has served as secretary of Iran 's supreme national security council for 16 years .
On Rouhani 's watch Iran enjoyed better relations with the west and allowed more scrutiny of its nuclear programme .
In three debates on national television and his campaign speeches Rouhani has come across as strongly critical of Iran 's current trajectory at home and abroad .
He has expressed support for freedom of the press and said he would work to find a way out of the stalemate over Iran 's nuclear dossier , which has prompted western powers to punish Tehran with unprecedented sanctions .
"" I do not approve of the current foreign policy .
We should try to have good international interactions to gradually reduce the sanctions and finally remove them , "" Rouhani said at a recent rally in the western province of Kurdistan .
Rouhani 's supporters wear purple wristbands in a move reminiscent of the previous election , in 2009 , when the opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi created massive momentum by going green .
In a heated TV debate last Friday Rouhani openly criticised Iran 's handling of the nuclear talks .
"" All of our problems stem from this â€ “ that we did n't make the utmost effort to prevent the nuclear dossier from going to the UN security council , "" he said .
"" It is good to have centrifuges running , provided people 's lives and livelihoods are also running . ""
To Rouhani 's dismay , Iran 's current top nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , is also standing in a vote that many believe might turn into a referendum over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Many view Jalili as Khamenei 's preferred conservative candidate but the supreme leader has said he has no favourite and sees any vote as a vote for the Islamic republic .
During Friday 's TV debate Jalili 's handling of Iran 's nuclear negotiations came under attack from Ali Akbar Velayati , a conservative figure who advises Khamenei on foreign policy .
"" What people are seeing , Mr Jalili , is that you have not gone forward even one step [ in nuclear negotiations ] , and the pressure of international sanctions still exists .
The art of diplomacy is to preserve our nuclear rights , not to see sanctions increase , "" Velayati said in comments that surprised many viewers .
In the absence of a explicitly opposition figure , however , many see the slate of candidates in Friday 's vote as lacklustre , though there is no active plan for a boycott .
The elephant in the room of the Iranian election is the fact that two candidates in the disputed 2009 vote , Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , remain under house arrest ."
2013-06-14,"As Iranians vote on Friday they are faced with a choice of six potential presidents , two having dropped out of the running in the final few days .
One of these was the last overtly reformist candidate , Mohammad Reza Aref , who withdrew in favour of a moderate , Hassan Rouhani .
But the election campaign has not caught fire in the way it did in 2009 , when the Green movement arose and seemed for a time to be on the point of transforming the Islamic Republic .
That is no accident .
Televised debates last week revolved around the economy and the nuclear question .
With unemployment at more than 20 % , inflation well over 40 % , Iran defying the US and its allies over the nuclear question and suffering sanctions that amount to an economic blockade , these debates could have been fierce .
They did produce rare criticism of the regime 's negotiating stance in the nuclear talks ( by the former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati , who attacked the regime 's favoured candidate , the nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili ) .
But they did not capture the popular imagination , and were ridiculed by some Iranians for the awkwardness of their format ( at one point , for example , a moderator flashed up random images on a screen and asked the candidates to say what thoughts they prompted ) .
Despite the formidable constraints , Iranian politics has an exuberant , irrepressible quality and , in the past , presidential elections have produced surprises .
The election of President Khatami in 1997 ; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005 ; and the huge demonstrations of 2009 against Ahmadinejad 's re - election â€ “ all of these were wholly unexpected .
For Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , and the circle of advisers around him , the dilemma of 2013 has been how to avoid such surprises and ensure a safe result â€ “ one that upholds the stability of the system , or nezam in Persian â€ “ while retaining enough public interest to generate a healthy turnout that can be presented as a popular endorsement of the system .
This dilemma reflects the still unresolved tension in the constitution of the Islamic Republic between the principle of paternalistic clerical supervision ( crystallised in the person of Khamenei , Khomeini 's successor ) , and that of popular participation in government through elections .
Islamic , or republic ?
Khamenei and his circle will always choose to err on the side of caution and control , avoiding the risk that goes with free popular participation .
The prime means by which elections are manipulated by the leadership in Iran is through the vetting of candidates .
Hundreds â€ “ sometimes thousands â€ “ are excluded by the guardian council at every election .
The exclusions from the presidential candidate list were significant .
Ahmadinejad himself could not run for office this time because the constitution ( as in the US ) does not allow a president to stand for a third consecutive term .
The exclusion of his political ally Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei sealed , for now , Ahmadinejad 's return to obscurity .
The other big name to be locked out was the former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
In the 80s and early 90s Rafsanjani was one of the most powerful men in the country , if not the most powerful , and he still holds important offices .
His exclusion showed again that power in Iran has been concentrated in the hands of a narrow group of hardline conservatives .
Rafsanjani was blocked because , when the system had its wobbly moment after the 2009 elections , he criticised the conduct of the poll , siding with the Green movement .
Everyone has to behave themselves to stay inside the tent .
In Ayatollah Khomeini 's time the tent was quite large : the founder of the Islamic Republic took trouble to keep a variety of views and opinions in balance .
Under Khamenei , the tent has got smaller , and more and more people have found themselves outside it .
Beyond the exclusions , the reformists have suffered from a lack of leadership .
Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , their candidates in 2009 , are still under house arrest .
Many Green - inclined journalists and others have left the country since 2009 .
Some are still in prison , and there have been more pre - emptive arrests recently .
Rafsanjani has been encouraging moderates and reformists to vote for Rouhani , his close associate .
Because there are still six candidates running this time ( in 2009 there were only four )
it is likely that no one will get a clear majority , in which case voting will go to a second round , where the two leading candidates will run off against each other .
Some room for surprises still remains , but as things stand it is hard to see how the system will not win .
There is an impression , reinforced by the attacks on his handling of negotiations with the west in the televised debate , that Jalili has not run a good campaign .
Velayati has appeared statesmanlike and would have Khamenei 's full confidence in future nuclear negotiations , but may struggle to get the popular vote .
Rouhani may do better in the election , but can Khamenei trust a Rafsanjani protege ?
The ruling group may get away with it this time , but they can not assume they will be able to sustain power in conditions of continued sanctions - induced economic meltdown .
One thing is certain : whichever candidate wins , pinned between the demands of the supreme leader , an increasingly desperate electorate and hostile foreign powers , his job will be no easy one ."
2013-06-14,"Iran 's presidential race appears poised for a runoff vote next week after millions of people queued until late across the country night to elect a successor to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Election officials at Iran 's interior ministry were yet to announce final results but a high turnout after a last - minute excitement caused by the reformists ' endorsement of a moderate candidate boosted the chances of a second round next Friday .
Hassan Rouhani , the moderate cleric backed by reformists and many opposition figures , and Tehran 's pragmatic mayor , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf , looked likely to emerge on top , with the chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili , thought to be the favourite candidate of the clerical establishment , falling behind .
Around 4 am Tehran time , the semi - official Mehr news agency cited unconfirmed reports saying Rouhani and Ghalibaf were leading in the initial counts .
At the same time , Rouhani 's campaign also announced he had entered the interior ministry for a visit and talks with officials .
From the moment the polls opened state - run TV broadcast rolling coverage with a string of interviews with people sympathetic to the system .
Voting was initially due to end at 6 pm local time but was extended for at least five hours .
Speaking after casting his vote in Tehran , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , urged citizens to come out en masse to refute suggestions by American officials that the election in the Islamic Republic enjoyed little legitimacy .
"" I recently heard that someone at the US national security council said ' we do not accept this election in Iran ' , "" he said .
"" We do n't give a damn . ""
State - run media worked hard to convey the same message .
"" I am here to vote because of my leader [ Khamenei ] , "" one Iranian told Channel 1 of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting .
"" I 'm happy to have a say in my country 's fate , "" said another .
A first - time voter said : "" I 've been in the queue for one hour to vote but that 's no pain , I can wait for hours . ""
A middle - aged man said : "" Our beloved soldiers gave their life for this revolution and became martyrs [ in the eight - year Iran - Iraq war ] so waiting for hours in the queue is nothing in comparison to that .
It 's my duty . ""
Local news agencies reported that all six presidential hopefuls had voted and pledged to respect the results .
Jalili said : "" Any candidate that people choose , and is confirmed by the count of the ballots , should be respected by everyone . ""
Ghalibaf , praised by many for being a successful mayor of the Iranian capital , promised "" fundamental changes "" and a focus on development and justice . ""
People 's choice will be respected by me , too , "" he added .
Another conservative , Ali Akbar Velayati , Khamenei 's top foreign policy adviser , said after voting : "" I request the entire Iranian nation to come to the ballot boxes enthusiastically and elect their favourite candidate since people 's participation is a reaffirmation of their support for the Islamic Republic ruling system . ""
Among those voting was Ebrahim Yazdi , secretary - general of the Freedom Movement of Iran , a banned group that is critical of the system . ""
Today 's election is about choosing between bad and worse , "" he told the semi - official Mehr news agency .
"" Voting is a national duty and a right given to you by God . "" At least three children of the former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who was disqualified from standing , were also reported to have voted .
Rafsanjani has publicly backed Rouhani earlier in the week and voted for him on Friday .
Ahmadinejad , who served for two tempestuous terms marked recently by deteriorating relations with the supreme leader , voted in late afternoon â€ “ breaking with the convention that senior officials vote early as a sign of loyalty to Khamenei .
Iran 's interior minister , Mostafa Mohammad - Najjar , said the hours of voting were being extended because of a high turnout , state - run Press TV reported .
It said turnout in Tehran Province was predicted to reach 70 % â€ ” though analysts look sceptically at official figures .
Official statistics show that more than 50 million Iranians were eligible to vote , among them 1.6 million for the first time .
In 2009 , when Ahmadinejad won his second term , the opposition Green movement claimed victory and said the result had been rigged .
Its leader , Mir Hossein Mousavi , remains under house arrest .
Analysts believe rigging is less likely this year because Ahmadinejad is not running and the current government does not support any of the candidates .
"" Four years ago the violent crackdown on peaceful protests that followed the presidential election exposed the authoritarian nature of those who hold power in Tehran , "" said Faraz Sanei of Human Rights Watch . ""
Today , regardless of who becomes the country 's next president , one thing is clear : the legacy of unfair elections , highlighted by the arbitrary disqualification of opposition figures , detention of government critics , and heavy media censorship continues to deprive Iranians of the right to shape their country 's future .
"" Few western reporters were allowed into Iran for the poll .
One Tehran - based correspondent described thousands of people queuing to vote but not on the scale of 2009 .
Irregularities were reported .
Rouhani 's campaign complained that the name of a former candidate who had withdrawn earlier in the week was still on ballot papers .
Iran 's interior ministry said later that it had dealt with the issue .
Access to Farda , a news website close to Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf , was also blocked .
In a strange paradox , the state is so keen during elections to showcase a country ostensibly united despite it differences that normal stringent rules do not apply .
Thus a picture published by a conservative news agency showed a young woman with virtually no head - covering , her headscarf loosely tied at the back of her head .
Iranian women voting abroad reported that they were able to vote without wearing the hijab despite normally strict rules imposed by embassies .
The BBC , meanwhile , complained that Iran had launched a new campaign of intimidation against staff working for its Persian service in London .
Relatives of 15 journalists have been harassed , summoned for questioning and threatened ."
2013-06-15,"Hassan Rouhani chose the image of a key to symbolise his campaign .
The cleric , who has risen from being a centrist figure to the country 's president - elect , was supported by Iran 's battered reformist movement .
On Saturday night , the door to the presidency awaited as he appeared set to succeed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . ""
Ahmadi bye - bye , "" chanted groups of jubilant campaigners who cautiously welcomed his win in central Tehran .
Many desperately hope that Rouhani , 65 , will steer Iran through its severe economic hardship and away from the threat of war .
The moderate , who is the head of Iran 's centre for strategic research , was also the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , serving as the secretary of the supreme national security council for 16 years .
Under president Mohammad Khatami , he was responsible for negotiating with the west over the controversial nuclear programme .
On his watch , Iran agreed for the first time to stop enriching uranium and allowed more scrutiny of the programme , avoiding the risk of being referred to the UN security council and economic sanctions .
During the three - week election campaign , Rouhani positioned himself as a moderate willing to improve Iran 's relations with the west and work to lift sanctions by finding a solution to the nuclear deadlock .
He also indicated that he would work to secure the release of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi from house arrest ."
2013-06-15,"The moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani has won the Iranian election and will succeed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president , Iran 's interior minister announced on national television on Saturday .
Mostafa Mohammad - Najjar said Rouhani had secured just over the 50 % of the vote needed to avoid a runoff , after a turnout of 72 % .
Rouhani 's win is a welcome surprise for many reformists , who are desperate to break back into mainstream Iranian politics after eight years of Ahmadinejad 's hardline presidency .
Although the only cleric among the eight candidates allowed to stand for election , the 65-year - old is seen as a pro - reform moderate figure .
He has positioned himself as a moderate figure favouring political openness and improved relations with the west .
He has pledged to find a way out of the stalemate over Iran 's nuclear programme that led the west to impose tough sanctions .
"" It is good to have centrifuges running , provided people 's lives and livelihoods are also running , "" Rouhani said during a TV debate .
Rouhani served as the chief nuclear negotiator under the former president Mohammad Khatami .
Under his watch , Iran agreed to halt uranium enrichment and was more co - operative with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Organisation .
As early results were announced , some analysts interpreted the likely defeat of Saeed Jalili , Iran 's current hardline chief nuclear negotiator , as a vote of no confidence in the current regime 's nuclear policy .
During the campaign , Rouhani repeatedly noted that on his watch Iran 's nuclear dossier was not referred to the UN security council and no major sanctions were imposed .
Seyed Hossein Mousavian , Rouhani 's deputy in Iran 's national security council between 1997 to 2005 , and a spokesperson for Iran 's nuclear negotiating team , said the early results showed that people in Iran were desperate for a change in the country 's foreign and economic policies .
Earlier on Saturday , Britain 's former foreign secretary Jack Straw described Rouhani as an experienced diplomat , "" warm and engaging "" and "" a strong Iranian patriot "" .
"" This is a remarkable and welcome result so far and I 'm keeping my fingers crossed that there will be no jiggery - pokery with the final result , "" he said .
"" What this huge vote of confidence in Dr Rouhani appears to show is a hunger by the Iranian people to break away from the arid and self - defeating approach of the past and for more constructive relations with the west . ""
On a personal level I found him warm and engaging .
He is a strong Iranian patriot and he was tough , but fair to deal with and always on top of his brief . ""
Trita Parsi , of the National Iranian American Council , said : "" Though hardliners remain in control of key aspects of Iran 's political system , the centrists and reformists have proven that even when the cards are stacked against them , they can still prevail due to their support among the population . ""
Meir Javedanfar , an Iranian politics lecturer at Interdisciplinary Centre in Herzliya , Israel , described the early results as a "" total and absolute surprise "" .
"" If Rouhani wins in the first round , it 'd be a clear sign that after the 2009 uprising , the supreme leader has learned that his regime needs to regain its legitimacy , and that will only come from counting the vote of the people . ""
In 2009 , when Ahmadinejad won his second term , the opposition Green movement claimed victory and said the result had been rigged .
Its leader , Mir Hossein Mousavi , remains under house arrest .
Analysts believe that rigging is less likely this year because Ahmadinejad is not running and the government has not endorsed any of the candidates .
Iran 's rial recovered its value against the dollar by more 6 % as results were announced in Rouhani 's favour ."
2013-06-15,"The White House on Saturday called on Tehran to "" heed the will of the Iranian people "" , after the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani was elected as the country 's new president .
In a statement , the Obama administration congratulated Iran 's voters on having the "" courage in making their voices heard "" in the face of censorship and intimidation .
It added that Washington remained open to engagement to reach a diplomatic solution to concerns over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
The White House 's comments came shortly after it was announced that Rouhani – a moderate figure who has expressed a desire to re - establish relations with the west – had won the popular vote .
A western - educated cleric and former nuclear negotiator , he secured more than 50 % of the vote , it was announced by Iran 's interior minister , Mostafa Mohammad Najjar – enough to avoid a run - off election .
The election of a moderate could go some way towards a thawing of relations between Iran and the west .
In the White House 's initial response , it seemingly held out an olive branch in terms of a negotiated settlement over the issue of sanctions and Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
In April , the last round of talks between the two sides broke down , with seemingly little progress made .
The US secretary of state , John Kerry , hinted that negotiations could be heading towards a deadline , noting that the talks were not an "" interminable process "" .
The election of Rouhani will raise hopes that a solution can be found .
The White House statement said : "" The United States remains ready to engage the Iranian government directly in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community 's concerns about Iran 's nuclear programme . """
2013-06-15,"The moderate Iranian cleric Hassan Rouhani has taken a strong lead in the initial results of Iran 's presidential election , threatening to win a simple majority and avoid a second - round runoff .
With more than 8 million votes counted from the 50 million electorate , Rouhani had 51.2 % of votes cast , Reuters reported .
Rouhani 's nearest rival was the conservative Tehran mayor , Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , a long way behind with 16.7 % .
Hardline nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili was third with about 13 % .
Seven hours after polling ended , Iran 's interior minister , Mostafa Mohammad - Najjar , appeared on state - run television to begin announcing the results .
The authorities had initially announced they would begin to reveal counts just after 2 am local time on Saturday ( 10.30pm Friday BST ) , but the first figures did not come through until at least four hours later .
This was in marked contrast to the previous vote in 2009 , which many believed was rigged , when final results were announced in matter of few hours .
"" It has taken them seven hours to count 800,000 votes while four years ago they counted almost 30 million votes in few hours , "" one Iranian living in Tehran said via online chat on Facebook .
"" It might be a good sign that actually this time they 're really counting . ""
Unlike in 2009 , Iranian agencies refrained for many hours from speculating on the results or publishing unofficial counts .
On Friday millions of people across the country queued to elect a successor to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The endorsement of Rouhani earlier in the week by reformist leaders increased the chances of a second round next Friday and injected last - minute excitement into the race .
Rouhani , 65 , is the only cleric among the eight candidates , but is seen as a pro - reform moderate figure .
He is a former chief Iranian nuclear negotiator who served as the secretary of Iran 's supreme national security council for 16 years .
Under the former president Mohammad Khatami 's presidency , Rouhani was responsible for negotiating with the west over Tehran 's nuclear dossier .
On Rouhani 's watch , Iran halted its enrichment of uranium and showed more co - operation with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Organisation .

2013-06-16,"Hassan Rouhani 's victory in Iran 's presidential election has boosted cautious hopes for a change in the country 's troubled relations with the west – amid warnings that any new policies would have to be authorised by the hardline supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The US congratulated
Rouhani – using his clerical title , "" Sayyid "" – and pledged to "" engage Iran directly "" to find a "" diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community 's concerns about Iran 's nuclear programme "" .
Britain called on him to "" set Iran on a different course for the future "" .
Arab states sent formal greetings but commentators emphasised the sharp divisions over Tehran 's support for Bashar al - Assad in Syria – which mirrors Saudi Arabia 's backing for the rebels seeking to overthrow him .
Syria 's opposition coalition called on Rouhani "" to recognise the will of the Syrian people as they persevere in the face of foreign aggression and tyrannical rule "" .
Iran is also the patron of Hezbollah , the Lebanese Shia movement that in recent weeks has been fighting openly alongside the Syrian army .
The involvement of Iranian security personnel in Syria has been far more discreet .
Israel , whose nuclear monopoly in the Middle East is threatened by what Tehran insists is a peaceful nuclear programme , was dismissive .
"" The international community must not give in to wishful thinking or temptation and loosen the pressure on Iran for it to stop its nuclear programme , "" warned Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
Rouhani gave little away in his first public comments , saying : "" The nations who tout democracy and open dialogue should speak to the Iranian people with respect and recognise the rights of the Islamic republic . ""
Expectations for significant international repercussions from Iran 's election result are generally modest .
Under Iran 's hybrid system ultimate power still rests with Khamenei .
Elected presidents do not have the freedom of action to change course on major security , defence and other foreign policy issues .
Still , Rouhani has views of his own and seems likely respond to positive signals – from the US in particular .
It was during his talks with EU governments from 2003 to 2005 that Iran suspended elements of its nuclear programme .
It was only when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president that Iran aggressively accelerated uranium enrichment .
During the election campaign he linked the state of the economy to the nuclear standoff and attacked Khamenei 's candidate ( and Iran 's current nuclear negotiator )
Saeed Jalili , for incompetence on the issue , saying that his dogmatic approach and "" slogan of resistance "" had not achieved much .
Rouhani also suggested in an interview that the Americans had first broached talks and Khamenei vetoed them – contrary to the standard narrative in Tehran which portrays Iran as always reasonable .
"" We could be in for a rethink period on foreign policy , "" suggested one veteran Iranian analyst .
"" But it could be a long process of gradual change rather than a overhaul .
Rouhani 's 16 years in the national security council puts him in a very strong position in understanding and handling the policy - formation process and the people and the agencies involved . ""
For some observers , Rouhani 's candidacy suggested a parallel with the decision in 1988 to appoint Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as commander of the army with a view to extricating the country quickly from its bloody eight - year war with Iraq .
Rafsanjani was elected president the following year .
In this optimistic view , Rouhani is the right man to lead a new initiative to allow Iran to disengage from its lonely and economically debilitating battle over the nuclear issue . ""
As the author of Iran 's previous dabbling in nuclear concessions , he can be the fall guy , yet again , for a deal that the [ supreme ] leader wishes to disavow , "" said Suzanne Maloney of the Saban Centre for Middle East Policy .
The key question is how much room for manoeuvre he will be permitted to have by Khamenei , the powerful Revolutionary Guards and intelligence establishment .
His cabinet , observers say , will be important to calm fears in the conservative camp that he is not planning a coup against them . ""
The [ supreme ] leader , it would appear , has accepted that things are not right and that a change was needed , "" argued Ali Ansari of St Andrews University .
"" What we do not know is how far he has accepted that the crisis in the country is real .
I remain anxious that all these raised expectations will founder on the obstruction of a leader who has not fully heard the message or understood what people want.""If Khamenei thinks that Rouhani can just introduce cosmetic changes to sweeten the west and get sanctions lifted , then I fear that he [ Khamenei ] will be sadly disappointed .
But so will all those Iranians who want to see real change .
Rouhani has to deliver substantive changes otherwise it 's not going to work . """
2013-06-16,"For a moment it looked as if she was going to tear her headscarf off .
The large , colourfully dressed woman in the crowds thronging Tehran 's Kaj Square did not speak much English , but she had no problems making herself understood .
"" We 're so happy , we 're so happy , "" she shouted , amid the cacophony of honking horns and joyous celebrations that greeted Saturday evening 's unexpected announcement that Hassan Rouhani had won Iran 's presidential election in the first round of voting , without requiring a runoff .
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets across the country , thrilled at the possibility of change .
For me , the only British journalist allowed into Iran to cover the election , it was hard not to get caught up in the excitement of the evening .
But then , in the shadows at the north end of Kaj Square , a nondescript shopping centre in one of Tehran 's middle - class districts , I noticed about 20 policemen watching the surge of people .
Perhaps it was fortunate that the woman kept her head covered .
Even before Rouhani 's victory was confirmed , many voters had been uncharacteristically hopeful .
"" Peace , peace , and not in enmity with anyone â€ “
that 's what I want , "" a young woman told me in the long queue of voters outside the Hoseiniyeh Ershad mosque in Nnorth Tehran on Friday .
And it seems that this optimism has been rewarded .
In Rouhani , Iran has secured a president who will , at the very least , be less verbally aggressive and abusive than Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the outgoing leader .
He will also seek to change Iran 's relations with the world .
Rouhani 's senior aide , Mohammad Akrami , told me that the new president wanted to "" improve women 's rights and ease the dress code "" .
He has also pledged to end the current stalemate over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Yet many here say that , whatever the election result , the real power will remain entrenched in Iran 's vast and complex security system .
The sunglassed Basij militiamen on their motorbikes will still enforce the clerics ' will , alongside the powerful Revolutionary Guard .
Change , if it comes as a result of last Friday 's vote , will be gradual indeed .
"" I do n't believe a word of it , "" said a well - dressed woman in north Tehran when asked about her vote .
"" I did n't vote .
They are all conservatives , they are all the same , "" she added .
Rouhani appears to be something of a post - Islamic revolution phenomenon .
He has three political roots .
One is planted close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
A second stems from his own track record as head of Iran 's national security council and one - time nuclear negotiator .
The third is newly germinated in elements of the reform movement that was so violently put down after the last presidential vote four years ago .
No sooner had votes been counted on Saturday than those close to the supreme leader started to deny that Rouhani had ever been anywhere near a reformist thought .
So why did more than 18 million Iranians vote for him ? ""
The economy , "" a taxi driver said .
"" Sanctions , "" said a woman in a black hijab and chador ( the full - length cloak worn by Iranian women ) .
"" We ca n't carry on with inflation like this , I wo n't be able to live .
"" It is clear that Iran 's theocratic leaders were badly bruised by both the Green movement uprising after the 2009 presidential election â€ “ when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the official results , which they believed had been rigged â€ “ and the violence required to contain it .
On Saturday the supreme leader even talked about it : "" The people suffered from the lawlessness of 2009 .
Then there was passion and excitement , but along with insults .
We have progressed a lot in four years , "" he said .
But not far enough for the wife of the leading reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh , who protested , wearing green , outside a polling station in north Tehran .
"" My husband was a minister under [ reformist ] President Khatami .
He 's been in prison for four years , "" she said .
"" He refused to defend himself ; he regarded his trial as unfair . ""
No one knows how many political prisoners there are but researchers talk of many hundreds .
Mentioning them is not popular with the authorities here .
Indeed , many within the security apparatus do not like foreign journalists being here at all .
They resent the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance for giving visas to me and my team .
Last Tuesday , while working on a story about the effect of western sanctions on healthcare , we were arrested outside a pharmacy in which the price of bowel cancer drugs had risen tenfold in six months .
The eight young plainclothed zealots from the Revolutionary Guard refused to identify themselves but they made it clear who they were .
Eventually we were released , but only after gaining a sharp insight into the colliding interests of the factions that make up Iran 's Islamic revolution .
And yet beyond the bugs in hotel rooms , the arrests , and strange people taking photographs wherever you go , there is something continuously absorbing and intriguing about Iran that renders the paranoia it provokes entirely bearable .
The country is spectacular , the people are approachable , friendly and remain westward - looking .
Many are highly educated and skilled , and 6,000 years after the country began , they are still building .
In short , they are people the west used to and should still do business with .
For all its faults , Iran remains a haven of peace , surrounded by wars in which the west is deeply involved , and set to become more so after Barack Obama announced his intention last week to arm the Syrian rebels .
By midnight on Saturday the Chamran highway that leads to the centre of Tehran was sporting a noisy three - car - wide , five - mile queue of families desperate to join the celebrations .
Perhaps Rouhani has just earned Iran a break .
On the ground there seems to be a very slim chance that things will change , but the regional timing is far worse than challenging .
Perhaps Obama would consider extending the open hand of friendship he mentioned in his Cairo speech four years ago to Rouhani ."
2013-06-17,"Iran 's president - elect , Hassan Rouhani , whose sensational victory in Friday 's election prompted nationwide celebrations , has promised to reduce tensions with the west , show more transparency on its nuclear front and bring moderation back to the forefront of Iranian politics .
In his first press conference in Tehran , two days after being confirmed as the elected successor to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Rouhani presented himself as a moderate politician willing to "" enhance mutual trust "" between Tehran and the international community , including Britain and the US , and as the saviour of the Iranian economy by working to lift sanctions .
"" We have to enhance mutual trust between Iran and other countries , "" said Rouhani , nicknamed in the Iranian media as the diplomat sheikh and the sheikh of hope .
"" We have to build trust , "" he said .
Rouhani made clear that his government will pursue a "" friendly relationship "" with all its neighbours , including the Arab countries , in particular Saudi Arabia .
The press conference , held in Iran 's centre for strategic studies , an institution Rouhani has presided over for 22 years , was at times chaotic , as only a limited number of Iranian and foreign reporters in the packed room were given the chance to ask questions .
The session , which lasted an hour and half , was broadcast live on national television .
In a sharp contrast to the outgoing president , Rouhani avoided issuing inflammatory statements against the west and instead promised improved relations .
He outlined his priorities by saying : "" Your government … will follow up national goals … in the path of saving the country 's economy , revive ethics and constructive interaction with the world through moderation . ""
In regards to Iran 's nuclear programme – which the west suspects to have military dimensions , while Tehran insists it is entirely for peaceful purposes –
Rouhani said his government would restore "" mutual confidence "" by promoting step - by - step measures in order to reassure the international community about Iranian ambitions . ""
The first step will be showing greater transparency , "" he said .
"" We are ready to show greater transparency and make clear that the Islamic Republic of Iran 's actions are totally within international frameworks . ""
He described western sanctions targeting Iran 's economy and its banking system as "" cruel "" and said his government 's goal would be that no new sanctions are imposed and the existing measures are lifted . ""
The Iranian nation has done nothing to deserve sanctions .
The works it has done has been within international frameworks .
If sanctions have any benefits , it will only benefit Israel .
It has no benefits for others , "" he said .
Iran 's national currency was sent into a tailspin last year as the toughest - ever sanctions imposed on Tehran since the 1979 Islamic republic started to have an impact .
A serious shortage of medicine followed as banking restrictions impacted pharmaceutical companies in Iran and hundreds of thousands of Iranians with serious illness were put at risk .
Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , said in an interview on Monday that he did not think Rouhani could soothe nuclear tensions because Tehran 's nuclear policies rested in the hands of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . ""
The Iranian election clearly reflects deep disaffection of the Iranian people with its regime , but unfortunately it does n't have the power to change Iran 's nuclear ambitions , "" Netanyahu said .
Despite the hostility among Iranian hardliners towards British media , a BBC journalist was allowed to ask a question about Tehran - London ties , which were downgraded in 2011 following the storming of the British embassy by angry protesters .
"" We will try to improve relations with all countries we recognise based on mutual respect and the UK is not an exception , "" Rouhani said , signalling that diplomatic relations could be normalised .
UK foreign secretary William Hague said : "" The government hopes that following Dr Rouhani 's election , the Iranian government will take up the opportunity of a new relationship with the international community by making every effort to reach a negotiated settlement on the nuclear issue . ""
When asked by a US journalist if his mandate would included engaging in direct talks with the US , Rouhani said it was a difficult question but signalled it was possible , provided that the US government recognised the rights of Iranian people . ""
The issue of relations between Iran and America is a complicated and difficult issue , "" Rohani said .
"" It is an old wound that needs to be healed . ""
Speaking on Syria , where the west sees Iran as complicit with Syria 's Bashar al - Assad regime , Rouhani said his government would be opposed to foreign intervention .
"" It 's up to the Syrian people to decide for their future , "" he said .
"" We are opposed to terrorism , civil war and foreign intervention and we hope peace and tranquillity will return to Syria through the cooperation with countries of the region and world . ""
Rouhani 's victory was met with cautious optimism in the west , with the White House congratulating Iranians on their choice .
Following his win , Tehran 's stock exchange index has gone up and the national currency , the rial , recovered its value against the dollar .
Web users also said internet speed has improved , with the restoration of access to VPNs used to bypass filtering and less jamming of satellite signals by the state .
Although the Iranian questions were focused mainly on the economy , the president was also pressed on the issues of political openness and press freedom .
In an apparent reference to the house arrest of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , a journalist asked if he would work to lift restrictions on "" leading political figures who have held key positions after the revolution "" .
Rouhani responded saying it was not only his decision .
At the end of the conference , one person shouted : "" Rouhani remember , Mir Hossein should also be here . ""
One commentator noted it was the first time Mousavi 's name had been heard on national television for a long time and another wondered if he was watching the press conference in his house surrounded by security officials ."
2013-06-17,"Iran 's outgoing president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been summoned to a criminal court in Tehran to answer unspecified charges following the victory of the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani in Friday 's presidential election .
Local news agencies on Monday published a copy of the summons issued by judicial authorities demanding that Ahmadinejad appear before the court in November , a few months after he has handed over the Iranian presidency to Rouhani .
It revealed little except that a lawsuit had been lodged by the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani .
The news , initially announced by the government website dolat.ir , was the latest in a series of bruising setbacks for Ahmadinejad , who has fallen foul of his erstwhile patrons and lost a great deal of influence in Iranian politics . ""
Appear in court following the complaint lodged against you by the head of parliament 's Article 90 committee as well as Ali Larijani , the head of the parliament and Mr Yaghoub Khalilnejad , "" read the summons published by the semi - official Fars news agency .
The government 's website said the charges were not specified .
Rouhani himself has nothing to do with the lawsuit but the timing showed Ahmadinejad 's parliamentary rivals had waited until the election was over before making their complaint public .
Ahmadinejad is scheduled to hand over Iran 's presidency to Rouhani in early August , when the president - elect will be sworn in .
In February , Ahmadinejad and Larijani engaged in a public spat at the highest levels of the Islamic republic when the president played a secretly filmed tape in a public session that implied the speaker 's brother was financially corrupt .
In a dramatic sequence of events that marked the climax of the power struggle between Ahmadinejad and his conservative rivals in parliament , Ahmadinejad 's tape showed Larijani 's brother , Fazel , allegedly trading on his sibling 's influence for financial gain in a conversation with Saeed Mortazavi , the caretaker of Iran 's social welfare organisation .
"" These are audio and video , and the tape is clear , "" said Ahmadinejad at the time .
"" If the honourable parliament speaker sees fit , we can turn over the 24 to 25 hours of recordings to you . ""
A few minutes of a barely audible tape were played as millions of Iranians listened to the extraordinary parliamentary session live on national radio .
"" It was a good thing that you showed this to let people learn about your character , "" Ali Larijani retorted at the time .
Larijani 's brother , Fazel , denied the accusations and threatened to sue him but the incident was enough to tarnish the speaker 's image .
When Ali Larijani delivered a speech in the holy city of Qom shortly after the incident , he was met with angry crowds who threw shoes at him and shouted slogans .
Last month , Ahmadinejad accompanied his close confidant and former chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , to the interior ministry as the latter registered his name as a candidate in the election .
However , Iran 's constitutional body , the Guardian Council , disqualified him without giving a reason .
Conservatives close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , have accused Mashaei of undermining clerical power by advocating nationalism and putting Iran ahead of Islam .
Ahmadinejad , however , has stood by him"
2013-06-18,""" The intersection of Enghelab Avenue and Vali Asr Street was absolutely mental .
There were people everywhere ; we were all chanting various slogans such as , ' Mousavi , Mousavi , we got our votes back finally . '
It gave me goose - bumps all over .
Four years ago , before the government fixed the elections , I 'd been so hopeful that everything would change , "" says Masoud , a 26-year - old mechanic who lives in Garmsar , not far from the birthplace of outgoing Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
On Saturday afternoon , when it became clear that Hassan Rouhani stood a good chance of emerging victorious from the previous day 's presidential ballot , Masoud says he travelled the 105 km ( 65 miles ) from Garmsar to celebrate with people in Tehran .
Across the country , there were raucous celebrations in dozens of cities through the night .
Masoud cites the release of Green Movement leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi from house arrest as his main demand of the incoming president .
"" I wo n't quiet down until they 're free , "" he says .
"" I 'll feel like it 's all been a bust until I see them safely out . ""
In the public celebrations that took place in Tehran , images of Mousavi were more prominent even than those of the newly elected Rouhani .
"" I feel lighter now , "" Masoud says of the election 's impact . ""
Yesterday I started working at my old job again , but this time everything seems easier to deal with .
I used to hate the place I was in , but I feel like I 'm experiencing it all for the first time .
For example , I just feel great about doing what I can to improve this company 's business right here and now . ""
Razita , a 26-year - old graduate student in Isfahan , also says the outcome of the vote has had a positive , cathartic effect on her . ""
Up to [ Saturday ] , I just felt negatively toward most people , "" she says .
"" Like , all the relationships in my life boiled down to who was a supporter of whom .
That is , if someone supported Ahmadinejad , I wanted nothing to do with him or her and nothing else was important .
I was more or less forced to leave my grandparents ' house , and I felt like I could n't even speak to my aunt and I would give my dad hell about it all the time , but now I feel this overwhelming urge to forgive and forget , you know ?
The hate I felt has started to give way to something healthier , I think .
"" Danial , a 20-year - old student of psychology at a university in the north - eastern city of Bojnord , says he has faith that at least some of the changes that people have been seeking are finally on the way .
"" I can actually see us getting a break from the whole ' security state ' atmosphere and witnessing a shift away from the sort of empty populist discourse of the last government toward something with more of a stress on reason and morality , "" he says .
"" The economy and our foreign relations might even improve . ""
Still , he tempers his hopes , reminding himself that change does not happen overnight .
Danial refers with scorn to Ahmadinejad 's behaviour in domestic and especially international politics as "" lumpen "" .
He says that one of his main demands of the new president is a major shift in rhetorical style .
"" That whole ' sanction us so much your arms fall off ' , and all the other ridiculous stuff he said , I mean , that was just embarrassing , "" Danial explains .
"" Maybe it was funny to some people , but overall it 's terribly embarrassing .
People must have been asking : ' If this is their president , what are the people who elected him like ? ' ""
What I 'm concerned about most is economic stability , "" he continues .
"" The nuclear negotiations are tied directly to that , obviously .
[ Rouhani ] should also act rationally and with an outlook desiring peace in regards to the negotiations and to foreign policy as a whole .
The censorship of film , music , and literature must end as well .
All parts of society must enjoy true freedom of expression . ""
Ali Reza is president of the accounting division of a company that does business internationally from the industrial suburb of Mashhad .
"" As I see it , if Rouhani must learn one lesson from Ahmadinejad , it is to defiantly stand toe - to - toe with [ supreme leader Ayatollah Ali ] Khamenei , "" he says .
"" Or he could just do what [ reformist ex - president Mohammad ]
Khatami did 10 years ago and keep discussing and negotiating until everyone is blue in the face .
Khatami did n't have quite the backbone that Ahmadinejad has .
He 'll ultimately need to align himself with the [ Green ] movement ; that will earn him the support of all who boycotted the elections in addition to the more than 18 million people who voted for him . ""
In Ali Reza 's view , one thing in particular will demonstrate whether Rouhani can deliver on his promises : his cabinet . ""
Who he picks for his cabinet will be very revealing , "" he says .
"" It will show whether he is truly with us or against us . ""
Rouhani will have to submit his choices for ministerial positions for approval by the Majles ( Islamic Consultative Assembly ) in a few months ' time . ""
Do I have hope ?
A very tiny glimmer of hope .
I 'm not trusting until I start seeing results , "" says a Tehran journalist after Rouhani 's first press conference as president - elect on Monday .
"" He made promises , and a campaign promise is just that , a promise .
It 's meant to get people to vote , but unless he actually does something for the country people wo n't be trusting him .
"" We had eight years when the president made promises about jobs and housing and subsidy reform plans and never once did he deliver , so I think this time around people are being more cautious in believing what a president - elect says right away .
They want results . ""
Saman , a young professor at Tehran 's Shahid Beheshti University , says he has little hope that Rouhani 's administration will bring about meaningful change .
"" It 's hard for me to expect such a thing from a cleric who does n't identify as a reformist and belongs to the Combatant Clergy Association [ a political party founded in 1977 by , among others , Khamenei ; its current members include former president Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ] .
I guess what I mean is I do n't have high hopes .
I was n't terribly excited about his candidacy from the start and preferred [ former Khatami vice - president Mohammad Reza ] Aref , but in the end I had to vote for him as there was no one else . ""
Three days before the election , Aref withdrew and both Khatami and Rafsanjani endorsed Rouhani . ""
Still , there is a silver lining .
You can definitely feel what the Scorpions call the Winds of Change , "" Saman says with a wry smile .
"" Progress happens gradually .
People need to take advantage of the atmosphere that has been created by realising their civic duties and becoming more active in cultural arenas as well .
If the government is going to work from up top , we are going to work from the ground up .
"" People 's day - to - day needs must be met first .
According to [ psychologist Abraham ] Maslow 's hierarchy of needs , human beings can not endeavour for certain secondary needs until their primary , immediate needs are met .
""
Twenty - five - year - old Shahla , who works as an English language instructor in Tehran , says she is happy that her young students wo n't have to come of age in what she refers to as "" the disgraceful age of Ahmadinejad "" . ""
Finally the country will be run by experts and those who have its interests at heart and not a band of thugs , "" she says .
"" This alone makes me feel hopeful . ""
On the other hand , says Shahla , the election did divide her and her boyfriend .
"" My boyfriend was a leftist .
Well , he 's still a leftist , but he 's not my boyfriend anymore .
As soon as talk of a Khatami candidacy began , it was like the small spark of discontent between us exploded into a giant blaze .
We 'd had a lot of disagreements before and [ my boyfriend ] can be quite radical at times .
When I decided to vote , he told me he did n't want to be part of the ' flock of sheep ' going to the polls , and even up to five in the afternoon on election day , when Rouhani had got over 12 m votes , he was still mocking me .
Eventually it seemed like just the thought of me being happy and excited got on his nerves . ""
A short while after Shahla joined the celebration in the streets , she called her boyfriend , who was also participating in the festivities .
"" I asked him what made him want to join the flock , "" she says .
"" Then we got into a huge fight that led to us breaking up . ""
She takes a deep breath and continues : "" Anyway , the most beautiful thing about the whole ordeal was how people showed their political maturity and grace .
Their patience .
And just how much they had learned and grown together since the dark days of four years ago . ""
Shahla says that the events of 2009 made voting somewhat "" painful "" for her , and that on some level , she felt guilty .
"" As my friend put it , it was like we were sentencing a man to death , forcing his wife to marry someone else , and participating in the wedding party all at the same time .
But it was worth it . ""
Kamran , a former book translator who now vaguely describes himself as a businessman , finds Rouhani 's victory disquieting , rather than a cause for celebration .
"" I 'm scared at the moment .
I 'm afraid this will cost us later , somehow , "" he says .
"" I mean , the Majles is completely in the hands of the fundamentalists , so any reforms will be shot down .
Also , various radical groups within government are n't going to take this defeat lying down . ""
Still , Kamran says he voted for Rouhani , and that the country 's dire economic situation was the main reason .
"" The sanctions must be lifted first , which will require a final decision on the nuclear programme .
The economy is the most important thing for me because I like reading .
Last week , I bought four books and it cost me 180,000 tomans .
"" That is equivalent to £ 39 at the prevailing street exchange rate – a hefty sum for prose in a country where the average working urbanite earns around £ 275 monthly .
"" They were n't even antique books or anything .
I can only enjoy art and literature when my financial situation is relatively stable , you know ? ""
Mahmoud , a former PhD candidate in philosophy , declares : "" Rouhani has to fix everything .
I do n't mean just me –
I mean the lawless ways in which students have been treated . ""
He says that he has written a book but not yet submitted it to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance as required .
He is certain it will be either heavily censored or rejected outright .
"" I believe a kind of national reconciliation should take place , "" he continues .
"" Rouhani should meet and come to terms with Ahmadinejad and other leaders from various parts of the political spectrum .
He should show rightwingers that they have nothing to fear from us . ""
Yadollah , who works sweeping pavements and watering plants at a park in Tehran , has to pause and think for several long seconds when asked what he expects of Rouhani .
"" It 's hard to say , "" he eventually responds .
"" I had to take out a loan for my daughter 's wedding recently
and I 'm paying it off at 200,000 tomans a month right now .
Along with the other stuff I have to pay off , my monthly payments are about 600,000 tomans altogether .
It would be great to get some relief from the debt . ""
He asks for a cigarette before continuing .
"" Life in general is expensive .
I have to work several shifts here , "" he says , pausing to light up .
"" I heard that Rafsanjani and Khatami supported him .
When those two were in office , things were actually pretty swell , and he 's a mullah just like those two .
Hopefully he knows what he 's doing . """

2013-06-20,"It was a smart move by the campaign team of Hassan Rouhani to choose a key as the symbol of the politician 's endeavour to become Iran 's president – and a gift to cartoonists in the wake of a remarkable victory that has created rare optimism at home and abroad about the future of the Islamic republic .
In one recent image a smiling Rouhani was portrayed in his mullah 's robes and turban , holding out an old - fashioned key to a door with an unmistakably digital lock .
It was a witty way of suggesting that for all the excitement , solving Iran 's problems could be beyond him .
Rouhani , 64 , is most often described as a moderate rather than reformist leader .
But he is also a senior cleric with impeccable revolutionary credentials who has been an adviser to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and held highly sensitive posts in parliament and the regime .
Intriguingly , he served for two years as chief negotiator on the vexed issue of Iran 's nuclear programme , at the heart of the country 's tense confrontation with the west and the source of the sanctions that are crippling its economy – and was defrocked in 2005 for being too accommodating .
In his first comments after winning last Friday 's election , he projected calm and conciliation , pledging to "" follow the path of moderation and justice , not extremism "" .
After the turbulence of the Ahmadinejad era , sighs of relief were audible , from Tehran to Washington .
"" I am trying to maintain a degree of healthy scepticism in the face of Rouhani 's massive charm offensive , which is infectious and so needed after the bitter miseries of the last four years , "" said one middle - class Iranian woman .
Many speak of his caution and attention to detail . ""
Rouhani is smart and moderate with a strategic outlook and thinks very carefully before making up his mind , "" said Hossein Mousavian , a former colleague .
"" He would spend days or weeks writing a sentence or making a decision . ""
Rouhani has long been close to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the powerful former president who was disqualified from running again this year .
Still , the surprise winner has a reputation for avoiding the factions that plague Iran 's hybrid system – an Islamic republic based on theocratic authority but with a vigorous parliament and regular elections . ""
Rouhani 's approach to governing is much closer to Rafsanjani 's than anyone else , "" said an old friend .
"" He 's known as the second Hashemi . ""
Early on in the campaign experts suggested Rouhani was not well enough known to win .
But in the end he attracted support not only in Tehran but also in provincial towns where Ahmadinejad performed well in the disputed 2009 race .
Born in 1948 , in Sorkhe , a small town in Semnan province , Rouhani was the oldest of five children in what he called a "" religious and revolutionary "" family who lived in a modest home surrounded by vines and pomegranates .
His father owned a grocery .
His mother , Sakineh , remembers him as a calm boy who excelled at school , read the Qur'an and enjoyed swimming and climbing .
He was educated in Qom , the Canterbury of the Shia Muslim world , and changed his family name – which originally was Feridoun – as a security measure to avoid the attention of the Savak secret police when preaching against the shah .
( Rouhani means cleric in Persian ) .
Unusually for a cleric before the revolution , he studied law at Tehran University .
In the 1990s he was awarded a PhD by Glasgow Caledonian University for a thesis on the flexibility of sharia law with reference to the Iranian experience .
Little is known of his private life .
His wife 's name is not public knowledge .
The couple had five children , one of whom , a son , was killed in mysterious circumstances .
Rouhani spent time in Paris with the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini and Rafsanjani and entered parliament after the revolution .
During the war with Iraq in the 1980s he commanded national air defence .
In 1986 , as deputy speaker in parliament , he took part in secret talks with US officials as part of what became known as the Iran - Contra arms - for - hostages affair .
In 1989 , the year Khomeini died and Rafsanjani became president , he was appointed secretary of the supreme national security council . ""
He is the ultimate insider , "" said a former Tehran - based diplomat . ""
He knows all Iran 's secrets . ""
Rouhani acquired a reputation for staying cool in a crisis .
When Iranian diplomats were murdered in Afghanistan in 1998 , on the watch of the reformist president Mohammad Khatami , his was one of the rare voices in the regime to oppose a military response , despite public anger .
In 2003 , with the region in turmoil after the US invasion of Iraq , he became Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , agreeing voluntarily in talks with the EU3 ( Britain , France and Germany ) to suspend uranium enrichment temporarily .
Jack Straw , who was then UK foreign secretary , remembered him as "" warm and engaging … a strong Iranian patriot [ who ] was tough but fair to deal with and always on top of his brief "" .
He was a man with whom westerners felt they could do business .
An EU official recalled : "" Rouhani was different from Ahmadinejad , who was a kind of loony populist who would have sold his grandmother to do a deal , though the supreme leader would n't let him .
Nor was he like [ his successor as nuclear negotiator ] Ali Larijani , who was a sophisticated fellow traveller of the revolution .
Rouhani struck me as a kind of serious moderate who was methodical , thoughtful and conservative . ""
Rouhani did not share the visceral anti - Americanism of the Iranian revolutionary tradition .
In 2003 he attracted attention by visiting the scene of the Bam earthquake and thanking the US for its help .
In 2005 , after resigning his nuclear post when Ahmadinejad took power , he ran the centre for strategic research ( CSR ) , a government thinktank that became a refuge for many sidelined by the abrasive president .
Later , according to a classified US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks , the CSR was asked to help the campaign of Mir Hossein Mousavi , the Green leader who claimed that his victory , four years ago , had been stolen by Ahmadinejad .
But Rouhani failed to speak out publicly against the brutal suppression of the protests that followed .
During this year 's election campaign he was keen to display a moderate position on foreign affairs , citing Iran 's "" active impartiality "" during the 1991 Gulf war , a security pact with Saudi Arabia in the Khatami period , and Iran 's "" reasonable position "" in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US . ""
Rouhani will return many seasoned technocrats and diplomats to key positions and reinstate a sense of professionalism to the government , "" said Bijan Khajehpour , editor of Iran Strategic Focus .
But excitement about his victory is tempered by the knowledge that he will need to move cautiously to avoid alarming conservatives and hardliners , including Khamenei and the powerful Revolutionary Guards .
Khatami has already warned Rouhani 's supporters not to expect him to deliver too much too soon .
Ali Ansari , of St Andrews University , said : "" Whatever people are now saying about him , Rouhani is no Khatami , and faces a degraded state structure populated by a rightwing establishment with a sense of entitlement from years of easy oil money . ""
The task ahead of him is enormous and will in many ways be dictated by the strength of elite dissatisfaction , the maintenance of popular support , and last but by no means least the willingness of the leader to effectively take a back seat and give him space .
"" It is clear that with the stakes so high , for Iran and for the world , this careful and experienced politician will be closely watched when he takes office in August .
His first big test , many suggest , will be whether he can make good his pledge that Mousavi and another reformist , Mehdi Karroubi , be released from house arrest .
"" It will take Rouhani some time to get his footing and work with the supreme leader , who ca n't be too eager , "" said a former senior US administration official .
""
But Rouhani is a pretty tough character , and moderate is a relative term in the Iranian political system .
If he tries to reform he may find out , like Gorbachev did , that an authoritarian system is not reformable because it risks unleashing forces that may eventually bring it down .
I sense that Khamenei knows that and will try to limit reforms .
It will depend on how much repressed energy has built up and whether half measures will be too little too late . """
2013-06-22,"The election of Hassan Rouhani , a 64-year - old cleric , to the presidency of the Islamic republic of Iran leaves many people around the world with more questions than answers .
Many of those questions stem from the reaction to the 2009 election when the authenticity of the result – a victory for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – was cast into doubt .
The speed with which the announcement came on the night of the election confirmed to many that wide - scale irregularities had occurred .
The resultant "" green revolution "" sparked huge protests across the country for six months .
When the fatal shooting of protester Neda Agha - Soltan by an armed militiaman was uploaded on to YouTube the narrative of the last election had been written .
Bloody , contentious and most probably illegitimate .
So it is no wonder that questions were raised about last week 's election .
And yet the fact is that the Islamic republic , although not democratic , has since its inception in 1979 had a representative form of government .
It started with a referendum , it operates under a constitution with regular elections to a legislative assembly and the post of the president .
Even during the eight - year war with Iraq no elections were ever missed .
Thus , the Iranian state has been able to claim its legitimacy through forms of popular mandate .
To say that Iran is n't a regular dictatorship is n't to suggest it is democratic .
By democratic standards , these elections fell short , since they prevented many candidates from standing .
The heavy hand of the supreme leader was felt during the pre - election vetting procedures that smacked of selection rather than election .
The committee that is directly under the supreme leader disqualified both of the reformists ' principal candidates : the pragmatic and wily ex - president Rafsanjani , and the more radical Rahim Mashai , President Ahmadinejad 's deputy and anointed successor .
The field was left to eight candidates who seemed , at first , to be barely indistinguishable from one another – six conservative and two moderate reformists .
The opposition forces based outside the country were delighted and most observers expected a mass boycott .
But then something strange happened and it electrified the campaign .
A series of live TV debates sparked real life into the contest and a real contrast emerged not only between reformists and fundamentalists but among the fundamentalists candidates themselves .
Normally taboo subjects were discussed openly .
Ahmadinejad 's economic mismanagement has delivered an official 30 % inflation rate , a series of diplomatic own goals , an impasse with the international community and backbreaking sanctions .
The TV debates delivered a double blow to the conservative bloc , exposing them as dull and divided , and helped consolidate the reformist vote behind one candidate .
The conservatives were seen as fractured and fractious while both reformist candidates shone and Mohammad Reza Aref , one of the reformist candidates , stood down in favour of Dr Rouhani .
Iran 's 50 million eligible voters were suddenly offered a real contest and responded with a massive turn - out .
Rouhani polled 18 million votes , three times as many as his nearest rival , leaving him with an unassailable mandate .
The new president faces monumental challenges at home and abroad .
The economy is in free fall and the sanctions are having a devastating effect on national morale as well as its health and wealth .
The complications of having to work with a parliament dominated by his enemies and a supreme leader who still holds the major levers of power are daunting .
But Rouhani also rides a massive wave of national support and a feelgood atmosphere , helped along in no small measure by Iran 's recent qualification for the World Cup .
If his first press conference was anything to go by he has more good news to impart , committing himself to liberalisation of the press , lifting the restrictions on trade unions and a determination to find a compromise over the nuclear issue .
There are even suggestions that he will push hard for the release of Mousavi , Karoubi and other leaders of the Green movement .
To the Bush / Blair administrations , Iran was easy to paint in the colours of good and of evil .
What we now need is a more nuanced , sophisticated and informed engagement if we want to help the new Iranian president help himself and his people and save the world from another futile and deadly road to war ."
2013-06-29,"Iran 's president - elect , Hassan Rouhani , has said his election victory this month was a mandate for change and vowed to remain committed to his campaign promises of moderation and constructive engagement with the international community .
Rouhani told a conference in Tehran on Saturday that he would keep his promise to follow a path of moderation in domestic and foreign policy . ""
Moderation in foreign policy is neither surrender nor conflict , neither passivity nor confrontation .
Moderation is effective and constructive interaction with the world , "" he said .
"" People chose a new path … people said in this election : we want change .
The best language of the people is the ballot box .
The people 's vote is very obvious .
There is no ambiguity . ""
Rouhani 's pledges could reduce tension between Iran and the west and ease the standoff over Tehran 's disputed nuclear programme .
He has already promised greater openness on the nuclear issue while siding with the religious establishment that refuses to halt uranium enrichment .
He believes it is possible to strike a deal that would allow Iran to keep enriching uranium while assuring the west it will not produce a nuclear weapon .
The US and its allies fear Iran may ultimately be able to develop nuclear arms .
Tehran has denied that it wants to develop weapons , saying its programme is peaceful and aimed at generating electricity and producing radioisotopes to treat cancer patients .
Rouhani won by a landslide in the 14 June presidential election , defeating his conservative and hardline rivals .
He will succeed the outgoing president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in early August .
The election was seen in part as a referendum on Iran 's nuclear diplomacy .
The country 's top nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , a hardliner who supported a policy of resistance , finished third in the vote , which was widely seen as rejection of his tough stance on the nuclear issue ."
2013-07-02,"Two weeks after his sensational victory Iran 's president - elect , Hassan Rouhani , has expressed relatively progressive views about civil liberties , freedom of expression and the internet .
Social networking sites such as Facebook were , he said , a welcome phenomenon .
In his most outspoken interview in the Iranian media , Rouhani told Chelcheragh – a popular youth magazine – that he is opposed to segregation of sexes in society , would work to minimise censorship and believes internet filtering is futile . ""
In the age of digital revolution , one can not live or govern in a quarantine , "" he said as he made clear he is opposed to the authorities ' harsh crackdown on Iranians owning satellite dishes , which millions have installed on rooftops for access to foreign - based TV channels illegal in the country .
Rouhani , who has promised to put the Islamic republic back on the path of moderation after eight acrimonious years under the outgoing president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , warned that citizens ' rights had been neglected .
He said he stood in the June presidential election as a candidate critical of the current situation and also because he felt the country was at peril . ""
Today the republican [ nature ] of our country is overshadowed by a specific interpretation of its Islamic [ character ] , "" he said .
Rouhani 's reference to the republican character of Iran 's ruling system is a hint that the Islamic republic 's legitimacy is meant to come from the popular vote .
Rouhani is scheduled to be sworn into office in early August .
"" Some of the principles of our constitution have been emphasised while others were neglected and this is why we are facing an imbalance as a result , "" he said .
"" The freedom and rights of people have been ignored but those of the rulers have been emphasised …
Restricting [ people 's right ] to criticise will only stifle and lead to inefficiency . ""
Of internet filtering , Rouhani said some of the measures taken by the authorities to restrict users ' access online was not done in good faith and was instead politically motivated .
"" There are political reasons .
They have fears of the freedom people have in online atmosphere , this is why they seek to restrict information .
But filtering is incapable of producing any [ useful ] results , "" he said .
"" Supporters of internet filtering should explain whether they 've successfully restricted access to information ?
Which important piece of news has filtering been able to black out in recent years ? ""
He added : "" Filtering has not even stopped people from accessing unethical [ a reference to pornographic ] websites .
Widespread online filtering will only increase distrust between people and the state . ""
Access to hundreds of thousands of websites is blocked in Iran , including Facebook and Twitter , but millions of Iranians use them via anti - filtering software or virtual private network ( VPN ) services .
Despite the filtering , Rouhani 's campaign was active on both sites at election time . ""
The virtual space is a tool and it can be an opportunity or a threat , "" said Rouhani .
"" I remember that [ former president ] Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani once called social networking websites such as Facebook a welcome phenomenon .
Indeed they are . ""
Since Rouhani 's win , web users in Iran have reported a relative easing of online censorship and say revoked access to VPN accounts has been restored .
Rouhani also pledged to minimise censorship of artistic and cultural works and said the state – instead of interfering in the affairs of artists and cultural figures – should provide them with security .
"" We should not tighten the red lines all the time , we should show that censorship is not our goal , "" he said .
On the question of women wearing the hijab , a contentious issue in a country with millions unhappy about the mandatory religious code , the president - elect said he was against the crackdown against women with loose clothing – but he stopped short of saying it should be left as voluntary .
Each summer , as the heat bears down and makes it difficult for women and men in Iran to stick to their forced Islamic dress code , the religious police go out on to the streets to watch out for loose hijabs , inappropriate dress or hairstyles .
"" I 'm certainly against these actions , "" said Rouhani , saying a women without a hijab is not necessarily without virtue .
"" If a women or a man does not comply with our rules for clothing , his or her virtue should not come under question …
In my view , many women in our society who do not respect our hijab laws are virtuous .
Our emphasis should be on the virtue . ""
In his interview , Rouhani said he opposed segregation of men and women , including at universities , and criticised the politicians who are against allowing women to enter stadiums to watch football matches along with men .
Iran 's state television , IRIB , the mouthpiece of the country 's ruling system , also came under attack from Rouhani .
"" A large population of our youth are ignoring the [ state ] television because in it they have n't seen the honesty , morality , justice that it merits , "" he said .
"" When the state TV shows a programme about the birth of a panda in a Chinese zoo but does n't broadcast anything about workers staging a protest because they have n't been paid for six months
…
it 's obvious that people and the youth will ignore it .
The solution is to have freedom of expression . ""
If a day comes that our television shows more news coverage than foreign networks such as BBC , then people will reconcile with it . ""
Rouhani has previously criticised the IRIB .
During his first post - election speech at the weekend , he said a country which receives its legitimacy from its people should not fear free media .
He also said : "" Injustice is an injustice …
it 's a double standard to call an injustice in an unfriendly country as an injustice but to label the same thing in a friendly country as not … human rights is same in any place around the world . """

2013-07-04,"Since the announcement of Hassan Rouhani 's victory in the 14 June presidential election , pundits in Iran and the west have sought to answer the question of how Ayatollah Ali Khamenei let a candidate who was not his favourite win .
Many are convinced the election was preplanned and engineered by Khamenei , the purported puppet master .
But that view is based on an inherent misunderstanding of the nature of politics in Iran and the thinking of Iranian politician – or at least the thinking of Khamenei .
Iranian politics is conceived as a packaged project , conducted by the supreme leader according to a largely rigid mindset , and coloured by personal sentiment .
In reality , politics in Iran , like elsewhere , is a complex process in which even the most powerful player , faced with an unfolding , unpredicted set of events , has no choice but to re - evaluate , recalculate , and eventually choose from a limited array of options .
No one can get into Khamenei 's head , though it is ever - tempting to try .
The problem with speculation – including ours – is that from a pool of inconsistent deeds and statements , one or another can always be retroactively chosen and presented as explanatory .
For example , some have claimed that the acceptance of Rouhani – who repeatedly criticised Iran 's approach to the nuclear issue during his campaign – demonstrated that Khamenei was worried about the impact of international sanctions and had given the green light to accede to western demands .
But they do not take into consideration that in his remarkable speech two days before the election , in which for the first time he asked those who opposed the regime to vote for the sake of their country , Khamenei implicitly repeated his stance on the state 's nuclear prerogatives : "" The more weakness you show and [ the more you ] retreat , the more the enemy will advance forward . ""
Rather than attempt to analyse Khamenei as a figure with absolute power whose shifts and contradictions are due primarily to internal , mental struggles , it is much more revealing to see him as an individual situated within a web of sociopolitical forces that both affect and are affected by him .
This sheds light on a significant consequence of the election that has been largely neglected in its aftermath : how the severe defeat suffered by Saeed Jalili – the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and Iran 's top nuclear negotiator – effectively marginalised the radical conservatives who supported him , the same group that had been most vocal in its devotion to the supreme leader .
This inevitably brings us back to the 2009 presidential election .
The dispute over the results four years ago had consequences unforeseen by the regime 's top ranks , dragging them into a struggle for survival .
After 3 million people marched in silence through Tehran , giving birth to the Green Movement , Khamenei gave a sermon at Friday prayers , assuming that , as in the past , he could have the final say and end the protests .
This did not happen .
Instead the Green Movement and the threat it posed to the ruling system grew , as Iranians took to the streets with shouts of "" Death to Khamenei "" .
The supreme leader expected the regime 's elite to publicly support him and affirm the official vote count .
But , in his words , much of the elite "" chose circumspection "" to save their own skins and remained silent .
This left an opening for a radical faction among the so - called principlists , the political and religious conservatives who dominated the regime , to take the reins .
Though for years these radicals had called themselves the most devoted followers of the supreme leader , they had previously maintained only a marginal role in the polity .
Now a desperate Khamenei relied on them , as they were the only ones ready to support a battle with the Green Movement on the streets .
When Ahmadinejad became president in 2005 , the radicals had aligned themselves with him and for the first time gained a substantial foothold in the government .
Their harsh rhetoric was mostly directed at the reformists and centrists like former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , but at the same time they tried to uproot the traditional faction of the principlists .
Their honeymoon period with Ahmadinejad soon ended and they decided to officially declare themselves under the banner of Jebheh - e Paaydaari – the Perseverance , or Stability , Front .
It has been widely reported how the Guardian Council had blocked reformists from running for office in the last several presidential and , especially , parliamentary elections .
But it is less acknowledged how afraid this body of traditional principlists was of the radicals in their own camp , whose spiritual leader was the fundamentalist Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi , the only ayatollah to have bowed down in front of Khamenei .
In the 2006 voting for the Assembly of Experts , which is tasked on paper with supervising the supreme leader , the Guardian Council disqualified a group of Mesbah Yazdi 's disciples , including his son .
Despite having openly stated his disbelief in popular elections , Yazdi himself was voted in to the Assembly .
Other principlists endeavoured strenuously and , in the end , successfully to prevent him from becoming the body 's speaker .
Jebheh - e Paaydaari saw the opportunity to gain power after the disputed 2009 election , and criticised others in the principlist camp with increasing severeity .
In January 2012 , Assembly of Experts speaker , Mohammad Reza Mahdavi Kani , revealed that he had complained directly to the supreme leader about allowing the radicals to behave in this manner .
Referencing a Persian proverb to suggest that Khamenei would be abandoned by his other allies if he continued to condone the radicals , Mahdavi Kani reportedly said : "" The way some [ of your ] friends are behaving , only Ali and his pond will remain . ""
For all of their claims to blindly follow the supreme leader , the radicals on many occasions presented him with a fait accompli .
In November 2011 , for instance , the followers of the factions stormed the British embassy in Tehran , an act condemned by Khamenei as well as commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps .
It should thus not have been surprising when the Guardian Council disqualified the Jebheh - e Paaydaari 's main candidate , Kamran Bagheri Lankarani – described by Yazdi as the most righteous person "" on earth and under the sky "" – from this year 's presidential election .
Disappointed , the radicals closed ranks behind Jalili , who had previously failed to attract an endorsement from any principlist faction .
During the campaign , instead of attacking the more moderate candidates , Jalili 's new supporters went after their principlist rivals , deriding them as "" silent parties in the sedition "" , unwilling to openly support the supreme leader during the 2009 protests .
At their rallies and religious gatherings they coined slogans to suggest their candidate was Khamenei 's choice ; "" I vote for Jalili for the love of my leader ! "" went one oft - repeated chant .
All the other approved presidential candidates also had direct connections with the supreme leader , but none dared claim he was Khamenei 's favourite .
The election saw further splits among the principlists .
While Guard high commanders – including Ghasem Soleimani , commander of the elite Quds Force – supported Tehran mayor and former Guard air force chief , Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , high - ranking conservative clerics backed Ali Akbar Velayati , the supreme leader 's top foreign affairs adviser .
On one point , though , most principlists were agreed : while Rouhani was hardly their favourite , it was Jalili and his supporters who were most despised .
Hoping he would intervene in the election , the radicals ultimately tried to force Khamenei 's hand .
A few hours after voting ended , a radical news website unexpectedly announced the results from ballot box number 110 , in which the supreme leader had cast his still - secret vote : Jalili was in the lead .
But Khamenei ended up joining the consensus that the radicals needed to be restrained .
It may be asked , then , why the supreme leader trusted Jalili to be Iran 's top nuclear negotiator in the first place .
But the question , so framed , again tries to dig into Khamenei 's mind instead of looking at his actions within a multivalent political context in which different power cliques must be served .
It also buys into the very representation of Khamenei promoted by Jalili 's supporters – that he was particularly trusted by the supreme leader .
In allowing the radicals to lose , Khamenei also liberated himself from much of their influence .
As one principlist reportedly said , "" Jalili 's supporters had taken the supreme leader as their hostage . ""
Indeed , they had appropriated Khamenei 's image and succeeded in selling it to most of his opponents .
Pundits joined in , reading his mind based on the radicals ' self - serving representation .
If the fade - out of the radical faction continues , it should not be a surprise to see a shift in speculation about the supreme leader .
After all , the moderates and even some reformists have learned how to appropriate Khamenei and represent him according to their own narration – as seen in post - election expressions of gratitude to him such as the one by reformist ex - president Mohammad Khatami .
Traditional principlists are meanwhile settling scores with the radicals .
In the weeks since the election , a new discourse has emerged in which the Jebheh - e Paaydaari is compared to the Kharijites , an early Islamic group who were initially in the camp of Ali – the first Shia imam and the supreme leader 's namesake – and fought against his opponents , but later rebelled and eventually assassinated him .
As a principlist writer recently said : "" We must remember that Ali was martyred not by his opponents , but by the very same people who for years touched their foreheads to prayer stones and stood behind him in prayer . ""

2013-07-12,"The evening the results of the presidential election were announced , I locked myself in – a voluntary house arrest .
Moments after Hassan Rouhani 's victory was officially endorsed , Tehran had burst into celebration .
Hearing the happy clamor of crowds cheering the victory of their presidential candidate placed me , unexpectedly , within a minority .
This was the minority who had not voted because they do not believe in gradual reform within a militaristic theocracy , and because they are unwilling to trade the long - term interests of the Iranian people for skin - deep change .
It was a drunken sort of celebration ( sans alcohol , of course ) .
Those who voted must have needed to get drunk .
With a deft sleight of hand , the regime had not only led the populace to vote , with no little hope and hoopla , for a conservative cleric from the military / security apparatus , but it also had them feeling that this time around their vote was not stolen , even that they had made history .
What the celebrations clarified was that we had , indeed , been played .
The middle class , scared out of its wits by the prospect of another Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , had demonstrated that it would accept whatever alternative the regime would allow .
The burgeoning radicalism that , had there been a refusal to participate in the masquerade , could have dug in its roots and grown into a formidable challenge to the regime was forsworn .
Ideals of freedom and civic participation gave way to a naïvely optimistic reliance on the right to vote .
Even a large number of experienced political activists , brandishing sentimental slogans about democracy , put their weight behind the election .
The list of demands the crowd turned into impromptu slogans was so long and thorough that you would think Rouhani held the "" key "" ( the symbol of his campaign ) to a storehouse of panacea .
One can only pray that it will not turn out to be hemlock instead .
The reality is that Rouhani is an excellent choice – for the ruling elite .
The current condition of out - and - out economic and political bankruptcy demands a figure like him : someone with no real clout ( has anyone paid him a thought in the past 30 years ? ) but clean enough hands to try and wipe away the memory of Ahmadinejad 's corrupt , destructive presidency .
Someone to blow hot air into the deflated balloon that carries the regime 's banner of "" democracy . ""
In the aftermath of Rouhani 's election , the people 's list of demands only grows : he is to release political prisoners , rein in the brutal Revolutionary Guards , end the atomic danse macabre with the west , convince the US to find another bad guy for its foreign policy , and so on .
What is interesting is that the Iranian public could not possibly have forgotten the failure of reformist president Mohammad Khatami – with his much stronger mandate – to achieve very similar goals .
The Khatami experiment now seems not so much like a bright spot in the past , but rather a short - lived flare in the dark .
Four years ago , the street clashes that followed the presidential election began with a stately gesture : a silent protest , composed of millions , who posed a simple , rhetorical question , "" Where is my vote ? ""
As the silence broke and the protests faced mounting violence , the question was turned into a promise to the lost : "" Neda [ Agha Soltan ] , Sohrab [ Arabi ] , we will take back your vote ! ""
Now , in the jubilation that followed the announcement of Rouhani 's victory , crowds declared the fulfillment of that promise : "" Neda , Sohrab , we took back your vote ! ""
Did no one stop to consider the absurdity of mirroring these two events : one in which Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei brazenly disregarded democratic procedure , and another in which he played the magnanimous father , generously allowing the vote to be counted ?
Does not this second election , with its halo of legitimacy , make a mockery of the green movement ?
And do we not , as we dance before the cool stares of the same security forces that four years ago would have torn into our crowd , condone that mockery ?
The celebration was a willful attempt at disregarding such questions .
That is inaction .
What is the relationship between those who voted for Rouhani and those who did not vote at all ?
It seems to me that the conversation has degenerated into mutual interrogations .
The abstainers want to know why the other side consented to a compromise .
The voters demand to know what the other side would have happen : Civil war ?
Foreign intervention ?
Total stasis ?
The questions are pointless .
The radical type of resistance in which abstainers such as I believe can not be demanded .
At the same time , people have a right to make compromises .
They are not insensate .
They know what sacrifices they can and can not make .
Four years ago , Iran 's green movement offered some lessons to the world about street politics .
Today the lessons come from the streets of Egypt .
Blind street politics , the type of politics that is concerned only with immediate personal or group interest , turns the populace into puppets of power .
What a statement it would have been if the same crowds who came out to protest against Mohammad Morsi in Egypt came out as well to protest the massacre of his supporters .
As for the night the election results were announced in Iran , we should have come out , but not for a jig and a dance , rather for a stone - faced , defiant vigil .
For now , the only long - term benefit we Iranians can draw from the new , forthcoming presidency is to take advantage of the relative opening it offers and get down to the work of social organising , of training another generation to do political work .
In this way , and today maybe only in this way , we can do honour to what and who has been lost in the fight for freedom ."
2013-07-24,"Britain will not be sending a representative to next month 's inauguration of the new Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , despite an invitation from Tehran .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the agreed European Union position was that the ceremony on 4 August would only be attended by Tehran - based diplomats .
The UK has not had diplomatic representation there since the British embassy was ransacked by a mob in November 2011 .
Iran has said that leaders from around the world , with the notable exception of the US and Israel , have been invited to the inauguration – previously a low - key event .
The foreign ministry in Tehran said Presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan had already accepted the invitation , as had the Lebanese president , Michel Suleiman , and the Syrian prime minister , Wael Nader al - Halqi .
There are reports in the Russian press that the president , Vladimir Putin , may visit later in August .
Karzai 's office has confirmed he will travel to Tehran , but the attendance of other leaders is yet to be confirmed .
The global invitation has been widely seen as an Iranian attempt to use the election of Rouhani , a reformist and former nuclear negotiator , as an opportunity to loosen the isolation the west has tried to impose on Iran .
The US and EU have placed severe trade and financial restrictions on Tehran to try to persuade it to curb its nuclear programme , which Iran insists is for peaceful purposes , but the west believes is intended to provide the capacity for making a nuclear warhead .
The UK 's foreign secretary , William Hague , said last week that Britain is ready to step up contacts with Iranian officials .
But the Foreign Office spokeswoman said the normalisation of bilateral diplomatic ties would ultimately depend on reliable Iranian assurances of the safety of British diplomats , and "" in major part "" on progress in multilateral nuclear negotiations .
Douglas Alexander MP , Labour 's shadow foreign secretary , said if the Foreign Office has refused an invitation to Rouhani 's inauguration "" then this represents both a misjudgment and a missed opportunity "" .
"" Diplomacy involves meeting with people with whom you disagree .
The UK should be working with other EU countries to engage with the new Iranian President , while maintaining peaceful pressure through sanctions , "" he said .
The EU foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , has offered to resume nuclear talks after the inauguration .
A former British ambassador to Tehran , Sir Richard Dalton , said the UK decision not to attend was "" entirely reasonable "" .
"" This is a very difficult historical relationship which , if we are to mend it , both sides will have to go slowly and not give rise to expectations they ca n't deliver on , "" Dalton said .
"" In order to create a platform for improving relations with Britain , the new Iranian government is going to have to tread carefully with its own right wing . ""
He added that it was normal for Brussels to co - ordinate the European level of representation at official Iranian events to avoid sending mixed messages to Tehran .
Iranian media have reported that the former UK foreign secretary , Jack Straw , would be attending the inauguration , but his office said on Wednesday that no formal invitation had been issued by Tehran ."
2013-07-26,"A young Iranian couple , Masoud Bastani and Mahsa Amr - Abadi , both journalists and both imprisoned on account of their writing , have seen very little of each other for the past four years .
Like many Iranian prisoners they were granted occasional temporary releases , but officials always made sure they were not allowed out at the same time . ""
The authorities wanted to make life yet more miserable for the two , like an extra punishment , "" said one of their friends .
Their convictions were for colluding and spreading propaganda against the state , a frequent charge against dissidents and independent journalists .
This month , however , Bastani and Amr - Abadi were reunited at their house in Tehran , and pictures on Facebook showing the smiling couple embracing one another delighted their friends and followers .
Their newfound happiness is one of a number of small signs of change after the election in June of President Hassan Rouhani , a veteran pragmatist who ran on an ambitiously reformist platform .
With a week until Rouhani 's inauguration , such signs have fuelled hope that a peaceful "" Iranian spring "" could be on the way , reversing the intensifying repression of the last eight years under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Yet those hopes are tempered by bitter experience .
Green shoots of civic freedoms and human rights were even more apparent under the last reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , and at the peak of the 2009 opposition Green movement , only to be emphatically quashed by conservatives in the regime and security forces .
There is even greater caution in the west about the possibility of a better relationship with Tehran and perhaps even a deal to defuse the long and dangerous standoff over Iran 's nuclear aspirations .
National security and the nuclear programme in particular are very much the preserve of the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei .
But optimists hope that the intense economic pressures on Iran – amplified by severe US and European sanctions – that helped carry Rouhani to victory will drive the regime towards a historic compromise .
Rouhani has not yet formed a government , so the hopes and doubts swirling around his presidency are based mostly on speculation .
However , Iranians report that since the election there has been a distinct thaw in the air .
Bastani and Amr - Abadi are not alone .
More temporary releases have been handed out and a handful of the political prisoners recently granted leave have been told they need not return to jail
provided they stay out of trouble .
Others have been told they will be released on Eid al - Fitr , the holiday next month marking the end of Ramadan .
Those on trial for political offences say they have been promised acquittal or light sentences .
One recently released activist said his interrogators had been noticeably more polite , as if sensing the winds of change .
The new mood has been apparent among the police on the street .
As millions of jubilant Iranians poured on to the streets to celebrate Iran 's qualification for the 2014 World Cup days after the election , the police tolerated public music , dancing and slogans chanted in favour of imprisoned opposition leaders , which would have been suppressed only days before .
Last week 25 independent Iranian documentary film - makers accused of working clandestinely inside the country for the BBC 's Persian service were all acquitted , even though at least 10 of them had previously been found guilty .
The film - makers were alleged to have supplied the BBC with information , footage , news and reports misrepresenting Iran , leading to fears some would be charged with espionage .
However , the country 's cinema organisation , affiliated to the powerful ministry for culture and Islamic guidance , surprised many by ruling that "" none of the works was found to be propaganda against the ruling system and none contained anti - revolution material "" .
At the same time , local media appear to be pushing back previously rigid boundaries .
The semi - official Isna news agency broke a taboo by printing the names of opposition leaders under house arrest .
Summing up the popular mood , the former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who was blocked from standing in the election , said on Thursday : "" The election 's result has brought hope , peace and rationality to our country . ""
Even as they celebrate , many Iranians acknowledge they may be suffering from over - exuberance in view of the limited real changes to date and their extreme fragility .
On Facebook and Twitter , the two - word post - election chant "" Rouhani Mochakerim ""
( Rouhani thank you ! ) , is increasingly used ironically as universal expression of gratitude for everyday occurrences ( "" My brother just passed his exams –
Rouhani thank you ! "" ) .
The past few weeks have not just been a series of prisoner releases .
There have been occasional political arrests too , such as that of the journalist Fariba Pajouh .
Faraz Sanei , of Human Rights Watch , said it was too early to declare a new Iranian spring on the basis of a few rays of sunshine . ""
Rouhani 's win was certainly a surprise to most analysts , but it is not an indication that reformists will have the upper hand during the next four years , "" he said .
Rouhani 's impact on Iran 's relations with the rest of the world is even harder to predict .
Khamenei set the tone for national security and foreign policy in the Ahmadinejad era and made clear during the election campaign that he did not intend to change under the new president .
There are signs that the regime intends to use Rouhani 's softer image to try to win more friends abroad .
The government has broken with previous practice to invite foreign leaders – with the exceptions of US and Israel – to the inauguration next Sunday .
The foreign ministry even mounted something of a charm offensive in the direction of the UK , seen in ruling circles as Iran 's third worst adversary .
On the occasion of the birth of Prince George , the ministry spokesman Abbas Araghchi , a UK - educated fluent English speaker , offered congratulations to the Queen and the Prince of Wales .
The conservative backlash to those comments , however , served to underline the scale of the challenge facing the new government in attempting a rapprochement with the west .
Araghchi was fiercely criticised by parliamentary rightwingers , and state TV broadcast a furious diatribe describing the Queen as an "" iron - fisted dictator "" who chose members of parliament and filled key positions by appointment .
"" England has one of the most reactionary and medieval forms of governments , "" the report from London declared .
Ali Ansari , professor of modern history at Saint Andrews University , said the regime would ultimately have to resolve its contradictory views on dealing with the west . ""
The conservatives seem to think that Rouhani 's election will change international perceptions overnight , "" Ansari said .
"" But if they think that a smiling Rouhani will get sanctions lifted and everything will be hunky dory without giving something substantial to the west , they may be surprised . ""
The mixed messages emanating from Tehran have deepened divisions in the west over how to respond to the dawning of the Rouhani age .
The UK government has opted not to send officials to the inauguration , arguing that to do so would be to break with the common EU position that only local ambassadors should attend .
( The UK has not had a diplomatic presence in Tehran since its embassy was stormed by a mob in November 2011 . )
That decision was quickly condemned by the shadow foreign secretary , Douglas Alexander , as "" a misjudgment and a missed opportunity "" .
Ben Wallace , Conservative chairman of the British - Iran parliamentary group , also voiced concern that western mis - steps could undermine the new president . ""
Rouhani has a real task ahead .
He has to balance the politics inside Iran while at the same time trying to bring Iran into the mainstream of the international community , "" Wallace said .
"" The danger for him and for peace is if the US and the UK move the goalposts and are seen to be hypocritical in support of repressive Sunni regimes yet tough on the Shia nation of Iran . ""
The uncertainty over how to respond to Rouhani 's rise is even more pronounced across the Atlantic .
According to the New York Times , the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , passed a message purportedly from Rouhani to the White House , saying that the new president was interested in direct negotiations .
As an apparent sweetener to encourage such sentiments , Washington has tweaked its draconian sanctions to allow the transfer of more medical equipment .
At the same time , however , the Republican - run House of Representatives is preparing to vote on the imposition of even more stringent sanctions before going on its August recess .
A joint letter by two retired senior US officers , General Joseph Hoar and Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson , and Trita Parsi , head of the National Iranian American Council , published on The Hill 's congressional blog said : "" Rouhani 's election represents what could be the last best hope for serious negotiations with Iran to produce a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear dispute . .
"" The House must not snuff out hopes for Iranian moderation before Rouhani even gets a chance . """
2013-07-26,"Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , was elected on an ambitiously reformist platform .
This is what he promised : Easing internet and web censorship Rouhani promised to minimise online censorship , saying filtering was futile , and described social networking websites such as Facebook as a welcome phenomenon . ""
In the age of digital revolution , one can not live or govern in a quarantine , "" he told an Iranian youth magazine .
Relaxing women 's dress code
Rouhani has made it clear that he is against the crackdown on women 's dress codes by the religious police , who patrol the streets looking for loose hijabs , or inappropriate dress and hairstyles .
He has also pledged to reduce the gender wage gap and spoke out against segregation at universities .
Improving minority rights
During his election campaign , Rouhani said he would have a senior aide advising him on minorities should he win office .
"" We should pay attention to the issues and demands of our minorities .
One of the president 's deputies should be a member of the minorities so that he or she can pursue their issues . ""
Greater civil liberties
Rouhani believes people 's freedom and rights have been ignored in recent years and has promised to focus on citizens ' rights . ""
A strong government does not mean a government that interferes and intervenes in all affairs .
It is not a government that limits the lives of people .
This is not a strong government , "" he has said .
There are also some key international indicators to watch : West 's nuclear talks with Iran Iran 's current foreign minister , Ali Akbar Salehi , has indicated that Tehran is waiting for the president - elect Rouhani to announce his nuclear negotiating team after inauguration to resume talks with the world 's major powers , including the US , France , Germany , China , Russia and Britain – the group known as "" P5 + 1 "" .
No date and venue has been chosen yet but the European Union 's foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , said that the west was waiting for the new Iranian team , too .
The question is whether a new Iranian team would succeed in breaking the current stalemate and persuade Tehran to scale back its nuclear activities in return for a proportionate lifting of sanctions .
IAEA concerns
When Rouhani was the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator in 2003 , Tehran agreed to halt its enrichment of uranium and allow more scrutiny into its facilities by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors .
Iran has made it clear it will not halt enrichment again but the question remains whether Rouhani would agree to an investigation of the country 's suspected weapon - related activities .
Rouhani at his first UN general assembly September will mark Rouhani 's first trip to the UN general assembly in New York as Iran 's new president .
All eyes will be on Rouhani and his speech , and any potential bilateral meetings between the Iranian delegation and western governments , who have in recent years shunned the government of the outgoing president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Some American analysts have called on the Obama administration to take the opportunity to indicate that it is open to a meeting between Tehran - Washington delegations ."
2013-07-31,"Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , is expected to extend an olive branch to the US and set a new tone in his country 's foreign policy by choosing a former Tehran ambassador to the United Nations as his foreign minister .
Mohammad Javad Zarif , who has been previously involved in rare and often secret bilateral negotiations between Tehran and Washington , is being tipped as Rouhani 's nominee for the post .
Rouhani will publicly announce members of his cabinet next week , after his official inauguration on Sunday , but local agencies in Tehran reported that the appointment of a number of top ministers had been finalised , with key positions set to be held by technocrats and pro - reform moderate figures .
Under Iranian law Rouhani will have to present his full list of cabinet nominees to the parliament , which will consider their merits one by one before their appointments are made official .
Although Rouhani , as head of the government , is responsible for choosing ministers , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final word on all state matters , traditionally has full influence over key ministries , including the foreign ministry .
If Zarif 's appointment is confirmed , it would probably mean that it has had Khamenei 's blessing .
Mohammad Sadegh Kharazi , another former ambassador to the UN and an adviser to the reformist former president Mohammad Khatami , said Zarif would be in Rouhani 's cabinet . ""
He has an objective view about international issues and is capable of finding solutions , "" Kharazi told the Guardian by phone from Tehran .
Above all , Kharazi said , the 53-year - old Zarif , a fluent English speaker and a PhD graduate from the University of Denver , was trusted by Khamenei .
Given this , he said , Zarif was best positioned to normalise Tehran 's relations with Washington should Khamenei decide on such a policy .
Khamenei has recently signalled he is not optimistic about any future direct talks between the US and Iran , but analysts reading between the lines said he did not voice any objection either .
"" Our foreign policy is completely centralised , meaning that it should be approved by the supreme leader , "" said Kharazi .
"" If we see positive signs from the US and if normalisation becomes our policy then Zarif would be the best person to evaluate things and act appropriately and without misunderstandings . ""
According to Etemaad , an Iranian reformist newspaper , Zarif went to the US on a student visa two years before the 1979 Islamic revolution and later chose to work for Iran 's UN mission in New York for immigration reasons .
"" I became a diplomat accidentally , "" Etemaad quoted Zarif as saying .
Iranian web users said Zarif had deactivated his Facebook page since being touted as foreign minister .
William Miller , a former US ambassador to Ukraine who has met Zarif frequently in New York in the past , described him as "" extremely well - informed "" about the US and "" deeply knowledgable "" about his own country . ""
His knowledge of nuclear issues , which is the main question between Iran and the US , is very deep and it follows along technical lines as well as policy lines , "" Miller said .
"" He 's admirably suited by temperament , background and education to work on these issues that have divided the US and Iran for 34 years . ""
Trita Parsi , head of the National Iranian American Council , said he had dealt with Zarif on numerous occasions when the ex - diplomat visited Washington and led the US - Iran negotiations over Afghanistan at the beginning of the Bush administration , particularly after 9/11 . ""
He is a tremendously impressive diplomat
and I think to many of the Americans they found someone that completely understood them and worked and lived in the US for so long , "" he said .
But Parsi said Zarif belonged to a group of Iranian officials burnt by the US when the Bush administration labelled Iran as "" an axis of evil "" at a time when Tehran was showing signs of compromise . ""
While there were people who are capable and willing to deal with the US , these are the very same people who actually got burnt for having done so . ""
Parsi criticised US representatives who are trying punish Tehran with yet more sanctions , to be voted on in a bill on Wednesday .
He said it was a negative step while both sides were trying to send positive signals .
The White House and the Congress are currently at odds over Iran .
"" It will definitely have a very negative impact on the ability to use the fresh opportunity to move things to a better place because at the end of day this is the first US government response to the election of Rouhani , "" he said .
"" I think it 's the wrong signal to send to Iranians who in big numbers voted for moderation against radicalism , while the US Congress wants to respond to that by imposing new sanctions . ""
Since his victory in mid - June , Rouhani has been under pressure from conservatives about his cabinet nominations .
Saham News , an opposition website , reported on Monday that Khamenei had rejected four of Rouhani 's nominations so far .
Others touted for the cabinet include Eshagh Jahangiri for vice - president , Bijan Zanganeh for oil minister , Ali Janati for culture minister and Mohammad Forouzandeh for chairman of the supreme national security council and de facto chief nuclear negotiator ."
2013-08-01,"Iran has dismissed a sanctions bill approved by the US House of Representatives that toughens existing measures imposed on Tehran over its disputed nuclear programme .
Despite fears the new legislation could thwart hopes for a diplomatic breakthrough in the wake of Hassan Rouhani 's election victory , the lower house of the US Congress overwhelmingly passed the sanctions to further limit the Islamic republic 's access to the global market for its oil exports and punish rebellious customers who continue to buy Iranian crude .
"" We have no doubts that sanctions is a failed policy , "" said Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman , Abbas Araqchi , according to quotes published by the website of the state - run broadcaster IRIB .
""
Sanctions and intensifying them … will only make the nuclear issue more complex and more difficult to resolve , "" he added .
Critics of the bill said tougher sanctions could not have come at a worse time given that Rouhani will be inaugurated on Sunday and has not yet had the chance to compromise .
But those who supported the legislation said the new Iranian president would have little say with regards to Tehran 's nuclear policy , which is in the hands of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Tehran 's nuclear trajectory has experienced considerable shifts during previous administrations in Tehran .
Under the reformists in 2003 , when Rouhani was the chief nuclear negotiator , Iran for the first time agreed to halt its enrichment of uranium and allow more scrutiny of its facilities by international inspectors .
The bill will have to be voted on by the US Senate in September after summer recess and signed by Barack Obama before it comes into effect .
John Boehner , the Republican speaker of the house , and Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic leader , both spoke in favour of the measure , which was passed by 400 votes to 20 .
Boehner told representatives that Iran was a "" global menace "" , and Pelosi said sanctions should be kept in place because they had had an impact .
Some analysts fear the bill might play into the hands of hardliners in Tehran who say negotiations with the west are futile .
Rouhani won the presidential election in June on promises of moderation and improved relations with the international community .
The bill also highlights a rift between the White House and Congress over the US 's Iran policy .
The Obama administration , which does not appear to believe Iran 's leaders have decided to make a nuclear bomb just yet , says it is willing to continue negotiations and recently sent a positive signal to Tehran by easing restrictions on medicine and medical devices .
Rouhani is expected to name Mohammad Javad Zarif as Iran 's new foreign minister , in a move seen as Tehran 's olive branch to Washington .
Russia said the new bill would not help the nuclear negotiations . ""
Any additional sanctions are actually aimed at the economic strangulation of Iran , but not at solving the problem of non - proliferation , "" its deputy foreign minister , Gennady Gatilov , told Russia 's Interfax news agency .
"" What has been done through the security council is quite adequate and sufficient . ""
Jim McDermott , a Democrat representative for Washington state who spoke against the bill , said it would undermine efforts to resolve the nuclear dispute with Iran .
"" It 's a dangerous sign to send and it limits our ability to find a diplomatic solution to nuclear arms in Iran , "" he said .
Jamal Abdi , policy director at the National Iranian American Council , echoed McDermott , saying : "" The Iranian people sent a clear message in recent elections that they support moderation over radicalism , but that message has fallen on deaf ears among House leadership . ""
By forcing this vote before the US has an opportunity to engage with Iran 's incoming government , the House risks squandering a major opportunity and only makes a nuclear deal more difficult to achieve . """
2013-08-02,"Iran 's president - elect , Hassan Rouhani , speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a pro - Palestinian rally in Tehran earlier on Friday , was misquoted as saying that Israel is a wound that "" should be removed "" .
Iran 's semi - official Isna news agency misreported Rouhani 's quotes , which were then widely disseminated by western news agencies and prompted Israel 's prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , to react to remarks that the Iranian president never made .
Isna initially quoted Rouhani as saying : "" The Zionist regime has been a wound on the body of the Islamic world for years and the wound should be removed . ""
In fact , Rouhani said : "" In our region , a sore has been on the body of the Islamic world for many years in the shadow of the occupation of the holy land of Palestine and the dear Quds . ""
He added : "" This day is in fact a reminder that Muslim people will not forgot their historic right and will continue to stand against aggression and tyranny . ""
Rouhani did not mention the word Israel , nor that it should be "" removed "" .
The agency has now amended its article to reflect the true quotes but the falsified ones have already been doing the rounds .
Iran 's English - language state television , Press TV , also said Rouhani 's quotes had been distorted .
"" News agencies distort Iran pres - elect Rohani 's remarks on Quds Day , "" said a breaking news caption on Press TV , according to Reuters .
Rouhani was speaking at the al - Quds day , an annual event held on the last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan , aimed at showing solidarity with Palestinians .
A video of Rouhani showing him expressing those remarks is posted on Youtube .
According to the Associated Press , Netanyahu reacted to Rouhani 's falsified quotes by saying : "" The real face of Rouhani has been exposed earlier than expected …
This is what the man thinks and this is the Iranian regime 's operational plan ...
A country that threatens to destroy Israel must not be allowed weapons of mass destruction . """
2013-08-03,"Iran 's supreme leader has formally endorsed Hassan Rouhani as the country 's president , opening the way for the moderate cleric to take over from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
In a ceremony broadcast live on state television on Saturday , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gave his official approval for Rouhani .
As the ultimate authority in Iran , Khamenei has the final say in all key matters , including Rouhani 's upcoming selections for key cabinet posts , such as the foreign and intelligence ministers .
Rouhani , who will take the oath of office in parliament on Sunday , won a landslide victory in the presidential elections on 14 June .
He has pledged to follow a "" path of moderation "" and promised greater openness over the country 's nuclear programme , which has placed it at odds with the west .
All foreign diplomats were invited to the inauguration but Britain declined to send an envoy .
Douglas Alexander , Labour 's shadow foreign secretary , said the decision was ill - judged and short - sighted . ""
Britain should be pursuing a twin - track diplomatic approach to Iran where possible by improving bilateral relations whilst also maintaining peaceful pressure through sanctions , "" he said .
"" An open dialogue with Iran is not only important in relation to Britain 's security , but also to raise vital matters such as freedom of speech and expression in Iran with the newly elected president . ""
â€¢ This article was amended on 20 September 2013 .
It originally called the Iranian president Hasan Rouhani .
It should be Hassan Rouhani .
This has been corrected ."
2013-08-03,"The election of Hassan Rouhani , who will be inaugurated today as Iran 's seventh president , opens intriguing possibilities .
Since 2005 , the world has known an Iranian president who spoke the language of provocation and seemed to delight in keeping his country isolated .
That is about to change .
Finding a way to bring Iran back into the world 's mainstream will be Rouhani 's principal challenge .
His power is limited , though in the fluid world of Iranian politics , he is likely to accumulate more .
His adversaries , most notably supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel and the United States , ridicule him as a puppet of repressive mullahs .
In public statements following his election , Rouhani has spoken in terms far more conciliatory than those his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , liked to use .
He has pledged to walk more on the path of transparency and boost mutual trust between Iran and other countries .
President Obama told an interviewer in reply that he was open to "" a whole range of measures "" if Iran would "" show the international community that you 're abiding by international treaties and obligations , that you 're not developing a nuclear weapon . ""
That was an encouraging exchange , but far more will be required to thaw an icy relationship that has been disfigured by passionate emotions .
They prevent the two countries from pursuing common strategic interests , which include stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan , fighting militant Sunni groups like the Taliban and al - Qaeda , controlling the Afghan drug trade , and calming Syria .
On the American side , hostility is the product of the deeply traumatic hostage crisis of 1979 - 80 and Iran 's long and sometimes bloody campaign to undermine US interests around the world .
Iran 's hostility springs from deeper history .
A nuclear deal with Iran will only be possible if the West finds a way to calm Iranian fears that the deal is just another repeat of a cycle they have seen over generations .
At his first press conference as president - elect , Rouhani set three conditions for talks with the United States : Americans should explicitly say that they will never interfere in Iran 's domestic affairs â€ ¦ should acknowledge all our undeniable rights and â€ ¦ set aside unilateral and bullying policies .
These are three ways of expressing the same fear , which grips Iranians across political and social lines : that the outside world is determined to control Iran , limit Iran 's growth and prevent Iran from fulfilling its national potential .
During the 19th century , Iranians lost vast territories in disastrous wars and corrupt monarchs sold everything of value in the country to foreigners .
Iranians finally rose up and proclaimed a constitution , but Russian forces bombed parliament and re - imposed royal dictatorship .
In 1907 , Britain and Russia signed a treaty dividing Iran between them ; no Iranian was at the negotiations or even knew they were taking place .
Iran 's most formidable modern leader , Reza Shah Pahlavi , was obsessed with the idea of building a steel mill , but in 1941 , soon after he assembled all the components , Allied armies invaded Iran and the project had to be abandoned .
A decade later , Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh nationalized the Iranian oil industry , but was overthrown in a coup sponsored by the US and Britain .
More recently , Iranians have suffered under an escalating series of Western sanctions .
Many Iranians see the Western campaign against their country 's nuclear program as the latest chapter in this story .
Any accord between Washington and Tehran will have to couch Iranian concessions in terms shaped to address Iran 's deep - seated historical fears .
Over the past 34 years , whenever Iran has made a conciliatory offer to the United States , Washington was in the hands of militants who were only interested in war or regime change .
When an American administration reached out , Iran was in a rejectionist phase .
Washington and Tehran are still full of people wedded to the paradigm of hostility .
US Senator Lindsey Graham told cheering supporters of Christians United for Israel after Rouhani 's election : If nothing changes in Iran , come September , October , I will present a resolution that will authorize the use of military force to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb .
Yet the election also led to unusually strong calls for negotiation .
Twenty - nine former diplomats , military commanders and national security specialists sent a letter to President Obama asserting that Rouhani 's emergence presents a "" major potential opportunity to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts . ""
In another letter , nearly one - third of the members of the US House of Representatives urged Obama to test whether the election represents "" a real opportunity for progress "" and to "" utilize all diplomatic tools to reinvigorate ongoing nuclear talks . ""
The emergence of Rouhani , especially at a time when President Obama no longer needs to worry about re - election , makes imaginable what for years has been unimaginable .
Reconciliation would allow the world to stop fearing a Persian Gulf conflagration and hope instead for Iran 's return to the global economy , a responsible role in the Middle East , and even some form of partnership with the United States .
It will only be possible if both sides delicately confront the ghosts of history ."
2013-08-04,"Hassan Rouhani has been officially sworn in as Iran 's new president , promising moderation and transparency but also urging those who want the "" right response "" from his country to "" use the language of respect "" instead of sanctions .
In an inauguration ceremony held at the Iranian parliament in Tehran on Sunday , the 64-year - old cleric kissed the Qur'an and took the oath of office before senior politicians , foreign dignitaries and MPs , promising to serve his people , protect individual rights and defend his country .
Rouhani , Iran 's seventh president since the 1979 Islamic revolution , formally began his four - year mandate on Saturday when Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in a separate ceremony , endorsed his sensational victory in June 's presidential election .
During Sunday 's swearing - in ceremony , Rouhani delivered a speech in the Majlis ( the parliament ) in which he said "" people have voted for moderation "" and that his "" government of hope and prudence "" would work to fight poverty , corruption and discrimination . ""
People want change , "" said the new president , who described himself as the representative of all Iranian people and not only those who voted for him in the election .
"" People want to live better , to have dignity as well as a stable life .
They also want to recapture their deserving position among nations , "" he said .
He also pledged to promote women 's rights and advance equality for women in society , despite proposing a cabinet of all men .
Rouhani said Iranians sought "" peace "" and "" stability "" in their region and across the world and said Tehran was against "" foreign intervention "" in any country . ""
The only way for interaction with Iran is dialogue on an equal footing , confidence - building and mutual respect as well as reducing antagonism and aggression , "" Rouhani said .
"" Transparency is the key to creating trust but it can not be one - sided . ""
To cheers from MPs , Rouhani added : "" If you want the right response , do n't speak with Iran in the language of sanctions , speak in the language of respect . ""
Within hours , the White House extended an olive branch to Rouhani , saying that Tehran would find a "" willing partner in the United States "" should it choose to engage .
The White House also congratulated Iranians "" for making their voices heard "" during Iran 's election .
"" We note that President Rouhani recognised his election represented a call by the Iranian people for change , and we hope the new Iranian government will heed the will of the voters by making choices that will lead to a better life for the Iranian people , "" the White House said .
"" The inauguration of President Rouhani presents an opportunity for Iran to act quickly to resolve the international community 's deep concerns over Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" It added : "" Should this new government choose to engage substantively and seriously to meet its international obligations and find a peaceful solution to this issue , it will find a willing partner in the United States . ""
At the inauguration ceremony , Rouhani also presented the full list of his cabinet members to the parliament , which included Mohammad Javad Zarif , nominated as the foreign minister .
Zarif , a former ambassador to the United Nations , is a US - educated veteran Iranian diplomat who has previously led secret Tehran - Washington negotiations and is seen as best positioned to normalise bilateral relations between the two countries .
But despite the positive signals from both sides , the US house of representatives last week overwhelmingly passed a new sanctions bill that will make existing tough measures against Tehran even more stringent .
The bill will come into effect if approved by US senators in September , but a group of senate members have signalled their support for the legislation .
Iran had also invited senior British officials for Rouhani 's inauguration .
The UK , which has not had a diplomatic presence in Iran since the British embassy in Tehran was attacked by a mob in November 2011 , declined the invitation .
The foreign office 's decision was criticised by the labour party as a "" missed opportunity "" .
Despite this , William Hague called his Iranian counterpart last week and said he was willing to meet the Iranian foreign minister during the UN general assembly in New York in September .
Sunday 's inauguration was the first of its kind for Tehran , as it was attended by presidents and high - ranking officials from neighbouring countries and around the world .
It was broadcast live on state television , with the foreign dignitaries filmed as they arrived in a style resembling the Oscars .
The president of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai , was among at least ten presidents and many prime ministers in the room , though the only western official to attend was Javier Solana , the former EU foreign policy chief .
Also absent was the outgoing president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Ahmadinejad 's eight acrimonious years in Tehran 's Pastor Street , marred by financial stringency and international isolation because of Tehran 's suspected nuclear activities , came to an end on Saturday when he accompanied Rouhani to the presidential offices and handed in the keys before moving to his old house in Narmak , east Tehran .
"" We promised to have clean hands ; I say with confidence that this government is the cleanest government , "" Ahmadinejad said during a TV address on Friday before leaving office .
""
The enemy has introduced heavy sanctions and the nation has faced problems .
We have made our utmost effort but we could n't resolve all the pressures .
This issue has been very difficult for us . ""
In the months before leaving office , Ahmadinejad established a private university , called "" Iranian "" , where he said he would spend his time from now on .
Iranians celebrated his departure from power by chanting "" Ahmadi Bye Bye "" on Saturday night .
Former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , whose endorsement of Rouhani is believed to have played a key role in his success in the election , was apparently not invited for the ceremony .
Khatami is accused by hardliners of siding with opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , who have been kept under house arrest for more than two years without being charged or standing trial .
Unlike his predecessor , Rouhani 's speech was moderate in tone , carrying no direct reference to the Unites States or Israel .
On Friday , Rouhani was misquoted by an Iranian news agency as saying that Israel was a wound that "" should be removed "" , which prompted Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , to react .
Local agencies admitted their mistake but it was too late for Netanyahu to retract his statement ."
2013-08-04,"The inauguration of a new president in Iran is an opportunity for sending messages and Hassan Rouhani did not waste it .
He told America in his inauguration speech yesterday that if it wanted an adequate response from Iran , it should not speak in the language of sanctions .
To distance himself from his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Mr Rouhani promised a government of wisdom and hope .
He genuflected to the concept of moderation , refrained from naming any country that Iran considered averse to its interests , and the word "" enemy "" was missing altogether .
Foreign dignitaries were invited to attend for the first time and it is a pity that from Europe only Javier Solana chose to take the offer up .
Mr Rouhani is not a reformist .
He is a centrist who has kept lines of communication open to most of Iran 's competing power centres – the Revolutionary Guards , the clergy and the Majlis , the parliament .
Above all , according to Trita Parsi , head of the National Iranian American Council , Mr Rouhani will not repeat Ahmadinejad 's mistake in challenging the supreme leader .
While he used the language of reformists during his campaign , he was clear to declare his loyalty to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Mr Rouhani hopes to leverage loyalty for some leeway in setting a more pragmatic foreign policy course .
He has already set out on the right track by appointing Mohammad Javad Zarif as his foreign minister .
Zarif , a former ambassador to the UN , was previously involved in secret bilateral negotiations with the US , and is liked by US diplomats .
Whether or not Mr Rouhani succeeds does not depend solely on competing power centres in Iran .
There is a current of thought in US and EU policy - making circles that regards the emergence of a moderate in Mr Rouhani as the product of international pressure and of sanctions .
Ratchet the sanctions up further , as the US House of Representatives has just attempted to do , and Iran will bend a little further , or so this theory goes .
It could not be more ill - judged .
The anti - sanctions movement in Iran is broadly based .
The movement comprises reformists and conservatives alike , and in seeking to lift the sanctions yoke , Mr Rouhani is speaking for everyone in Iran .
Starting to lift the sanctions will require more than just the evidence of Iranian moves towards a solution to the question of nuclear enrichment .
It will need political will , and the spending of political capital .
The White House reaction , which said that Tehran would find a willing partner in the US should it choose to engage , was good , but Barack Obama has also to overcome the belligerence of Congress .
While the White House did not like the house 's bill , it did not spend time in trying to amend it .
Mr Rouhani has already been once round the track of compromise and failure .
As chief nuclear negotiator under President Mohammad Khatami , Iran agreed for the first time to stop enriching uranium and allowed more international scrutiny of the Iranian programme .
Again , the interpretation of Iran 's motives for suspending enrichment is a matter of debate , but the fact is it happened and failed to achieve a reciprocal move from the then Bush administration .
Total suspension of enrichment is not on the cards today , but Mr Rouhani will be cautious not to allow himself to be as exposed to the criticism as he was then that he was too soft with the US and got nothing in return .
The lesson for Mr Obama is not to cut the ground from underneath Mr Rouhani 's feet a second time .
Looking around the Middle East , it is not easy to be an optimist .
Fires are raging everywhere .
Iran 's Revolutionary Guards – despite Mr Rouhani 's protestations that Iran was looking to ease tensions – are up to their necks in Syria and in maintaining a physical link with Hezbollah , which they train and arm .
In negotiating with Iran , a vision unimpeded by wishful thinking is essential .
But an appreciation of how much worse this could get if another Gulf war were to be sparked by an attack on Iran 's nuclear installation is also needed .
If a deal is there to be done with Iran , it should be seized ."
2013-08-04,"The inauguration of the new president of Iran , Hassan Rouhani , presents "" an opportunity "" for Tehran to resolve concerns over its nuclear programme and better engage with the west , the Obama administration said on Sunday .
In a statement marking the formal handing over of power to the moderate cleric from his hardline predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the White House congratulated the Iranian people for "" making their voices heard "" and calling for "" change "" .
It added that should the new government in Iran move towards meeting its "" international obligations "" , then it would find a "" willing partner in the United States "" .
But the apparent olive branch comes amid hawkish calls in Washington for tougher sanctions on Tehran and the possibility of military action if no resolution is found .
In a letter sent to President Barack Obama , 76 senators demanded tougher economic punishment for Iran until the Islamic republic scales back its nuclear ambitions .
It also urged Obama to keep all options on the table , while keeping the door open to diplomacy . ""
Until we see a significant slowdown of Iran 's nuclear activities , we believe our nation must toughen sanctions and reinforce the credibility of our option to use military force at the same time as we fully explore a diplomatic solution to our dispute with Iran , "" the letter states , according to a version seen by the Associated Press .
The letter comes just days after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed new restrictions on Iran 's oil sector and its mining and construction industries .
Senators are expected to take up the same package in September .
The stance from Congress is at odds with that of the Obama administration , which has pursued a softer line on Iran as it transitions the presidency .
Rouhani has pledged to follow a "" path of moderation "" and promised greater openness over Iran 's nuclear program .
The White House appears willing to give the president a chance to put those pledges into action .
The White House statement said : "" We note that President Rouhani recognised his election represented a call by the Iranian people for change , and we hope the new Iranian government will heed the will of the voters by making choices that will lead to a better life for the Iranian people .
The inauguration of President Rouhani presents an opportunity for Iran to act quickly to resolve the international community 's deep concerns over Iran 's nuclear program . ""
The US has long believed that Iran has been working to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran insists its program is for peaceful energy and research purposes only .
The last round of talks between Iran and the wider international community over the issue broke down in April , with seemingly little progress .
At that point , US secretary of state John Kerry hinted that negotiations could be heading towards a deadline , noting that the talks were not an "" interminable process "" .
But the election of Rouhani has seemingly raised hopes of diplomatic solution to the impasse .

This article was amended on 20 September 2013 .
It originally called the Iranian president Hasan Rouhani .
It should be Hassan Rouhani .
This has been corrected ."
2013-08-06,"Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , has said his government is determined to engage in "" serious and substantive "" negotiations with the west without wasting time in order to resolve the impasse over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
Two days after he was sworn into office and in his first press conference , Rouhani also said on Tuesday that he was open to direct talks with the US , provided that Washington showed "" goodwill "" in action and put aside "" hidden agendas "" – an apparent reference to its perceived policy of regime change .
Rouhani 's remarks followed a statement by the White House on Sunday , which said Tehran would find "" a willing partner in the United States "" should it choose to engage .
On the nuclear issue , the 64-year - old president said constructive dialogue and interaction could leave both sides in a "" win - win "" situation . ""
As Iran 's president , I announce that the Islamic republic is determined to resolve this issue and remove the concerns of the other side while Iranian people 's rights are preserved , "" Rouhani said .
The moderate cleric was speaking to reporters in Tehran in a room packed with national and foreign journalists .
It was broadcast live on national television .
He added : "" We are determined and ready to enter serious and substantive negotiations with the other side and if they are prepared like us , then I am confident that the concerns of both sides will be removed through negotiations within a period which will not be very long . ""
Rouhani said he wanted Washington to hear the message of Iran 's election and show its willingness in practical steps , promising that any constructive move by the Americans would be reciprocated accordingly . ""
What counts for us is the US 's response in action , not their statements , "" he said .
"" We closely observe their actions and we will respond accordingly and similarly to any constructive and meaningful move . ""
However , Rouhani said the difference between the White House 's statement , which came shortly after the new president 's inauguration ceremony on Sunday , and the US congress 's new sanctions bill showed an inconsistency in the US 's words and its actions .
"" There has been contradictory behaviour and messages , "" he said , adding that the new legislation posed a dilemma for the White House .
"" We never approved the US 's carrot and stick approach . ""
"" Unfortunately , the warmongering pressure groups in the US are against constructive dialogue … and are imposing their will on the representatives of the US congress , "" he said .
Asked whether he was willing to meet the US president , Barack Obama , at the UN general assembly in September , Rouhani did not directly answer but said his trip to New York was under review and a final decision had not been made .
Rouhani said western sanctions had nothing to do with the nuclear issue and were merely designed to target ordinary lives . ""
The goals of the sanctions in practice are piling pressure on various classes of the people , "" he said .
Rouhani 's remarks were echoed by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former Iranian president backed by the country 's opposition .
"" The differing approaches of the US administration and congress raise doubts and do not send a good signal to the Iranian people , "" Rafsanjani told former EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in a meeting in Tehran . ""
Sanctions and threats have always cast a shadow over negotiations , and we should move toward the resolution of old grievances in an atmosphere of calm and peace , "" he said , according to the semi - official Mehr news agency .
At the US state department , spokeswoman Jen Psaki did not react to the tone or substance of Rouhani 's comments .
"" The ball is in their court , "" Psaki said .
"" There are steps they need to take to meet their international obligations and find a peaceful solution to this [ nuclear ] issue , "" Psaki said .
She reiterated the US position since Rouhani 's inauguration that unspecified "" credible steps "" to such a solution would find a "" willing partner "" in Washington .
Russia reacted to Rouhani 's nuclear remarks on Tuesday , saying it would support the Iranian president 's position .
"" We absolutely agree with what he [ Rouhani ] said .
This problem must not be solved with ultimatums , "" said Russian 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , in quotes carried by the Interfax news agency .
"" Now it is critical to support the constructive approach of the Iranian leadership . ""
A spokesman for Catherine Ashton , the EU 's foreign policy chief , said western powers involved in nuclear talks with the Islamic republic "" stand ready to continue talks to find a resolution as quickly as possible "" and urged Rouhani "" to seek a swift resolutionto their concerns .
As Rouhani has taken power in Iran , the price of crude oil has significantly fallen , signalling the oil market 's positive response to his election .
Ali Alizadeh , an Iranian political analyst , said Rouhani 's press conference , which was dominated by questions about direct talks with the US , showed the new president has a moderate and compromising tone not heard in Tehran for a long time . ""
He showed awareness of the west 's impatience with mere rhetoric around negotiations and suspicion that Iran is attending talks merely to buy time , by promising fast and substantive talks and not wasting time , "" he told the Guardian . ""
His emphasis on a win - win outcome for the nuclear impasse was an implicit statement that Iran is willing to compromise . ""
On Syria , Rouhani said Tehran was against any foreign intervention and that the Syrian people should decide their future through "" democracy and election "" .
However , he said Iran and other countries in the region , including Turkey , can help to facilitate the process of bringing peace back to Syria .
Ali Ansari of St Andrews University said he was not impressed by Rouhani 's remarks and nothing in particular stood out for him other than his comments about Syria .
He argued that Rouhani 's notion that Tehran needs to see actions not words could have come from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
"" I think the [ Iranian ] electorate might say a similar thing in relation to his [ campaign ] promises , "" he told the Guardian . ""
He certainly speaks well and has a great smiling countenance .
It is also clear that it is the economy which is front and centre [ of policy for Rouhani ] , not politics . """
2013-08-07,"The British prime minister , David Cameron , has reached out to Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , expressing hope that his election will create an opportunity for an improvement in long - strained ties between London and Tehran .
Cameron 's letter was sent to mark Rouhani 's inauguration on Sunday , according to Downing Street , when the new president took his oath of office in the Iranian parliament in front of foreign dignitaries and senior Iranian politicians .
"" I wanted to write to express the hope that your election will present an opportunity to improve relations between our countries , "" Cameron wrote in his letter .
Britain has not had a diplomatic presence in Iran since November 2011 when its embassy in Tehran was stormed by a mob , triggering one of the worst crises between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
London and Tehran 's bilateral ties have since been downgraded but not fully severed .
Cameron 's missive was unusual given the poor relations between Iran and the UK under Rouhani 's predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and given the Foreign Office 's recent snub to Tehran 's invitation to attend Rouhani 's swearing - in ceremony , which was criticised by the Labour party as a "" missed opportunity "" .
Rouhani 's victory in the Iranian election has raised hopes for better relations between Tehran and the international community , especially the US .
Cameron said he hoped Tehran would take a different course in the future and be prepared to improve London - Tehran ties on a step - by - step and reciprocal basis , according to No 10 .
"" Improving bilateral relations will be a gradual process and several issues will need to be addressed , "" he wrote .
The prime minister also urged the new Iranian administration to "" engage constructively and seriously "" with the international community to address its concerns about Tehran 's disputed nuclear activities .
Nuclear talks between Iran and the world 's major powers – the US , France , Germany , China , Russia and Britain , the group known as P5 + 1 – have reached stalemate but
Rouhani said at his first press conference in Tehran on Tuesday that his government is determined to negotiate "" seriously "" in order to resolve the issue in short time .
Cameron has also asked Rouhani to support a peaceful resolution to the Syrian conflict .
Rouhani said this week that his government would be against foreign intervention in Syria and that its fate should be decided by its own people through election and democracy .
The British foreign secretary , William Hague , made similar remarks last week when he called his Iranian counterpart , saying that the UK is open to improving London - Tehran ties on "" a step - by - step and reciprocal basis "" .
Hague told the outgoing Iranian foreign minister , Ali Akbar Salehi , he will be willing to meet his new Iranian counterpart in New York in September at the time of the UN general assembly .
Rouhani has nominated Mohammad Javad Zarif , an Iranian former ambassador to the UN , as his foreign minister but his ministerial appointment will only become official if he passes a confidence vote in the Iranian parliament next week .
Zarif has told Iranian MPs that normalising Tehran 's ties with the EU and managing its relations with the US would be among his priorities in office , the semi - official Mehr news agency reported ."
2013-08-08,"More than 50 prominent political prisoners in Iran have written to Barack Obama , asking him to end "" crippling "" sanctions and seize "" the last chance "" for dialogue with Tehran .
In a letter published by the Guardian , leading opposition figures , who with only a few exceptions are currently behind bars in some of the Islamic republic 's most notorious prisons , urged Obama to take the opportunity created by the election of Hassan Rouhani , as Iran 's new and moderate president , to seek detente between the two countries .
The signatories were also critical of the US sanctions on Iran , which they said had had "" devastating effects "" on the lives of ordinary people .
"" We believe the time has come for our two countries to turn a page and start a new era of mutual understanding , "" reads the letter , which is signed by 55 former officials , activists , journalists and dissidents .
Hopes of a rapprochement have increased in recent days as both countries sent positive signals after Rouhani 's inauguration on Sunday .
The White House issued a statement that said Tehran would find "" a willing partner in the United States "" should it choose to engage .
Rouhani said in his first press conference that his government would be open to direct talks with the US should Washington show goodwill and engage in "" practical steps "" .
Rouhani said the contrast between the White House statement and the new sanctions bill passed by the House of Representatives showed inconsistency between US words and actions in its stance on Iran .
Rouhani attacked the US sanctions , saying there were designed to pressure ordinary people .
In their letter , the political prisoners made clear that they agreed with Rouhani on sanctions , even though they are in most cases serving lengthy prison terms for criticising the government he represents . ""
All Iranian people , including the families of political prisoners and especially the low income groups , are suffering under the burden of rampant inflation and shortages of medical supplies and other basic necessities of life , "" the letter reads .
"" The sanctions have now turned into a collective punishment imposed on the Iranian people as a whole , not the government only .
The national economy has shrunk over the past couple of years and the strength of Iran as a nation - state is being reduced .
"" The signatories described Rouhani as "" a politician known to be a firm believer in dialogue and constructive engagement in international relations "" who also enjoys "" a solid base of support "" . "" In our view , the tenure of this government may be the last chance to bring this conflict to a reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution . ""
The letter warned , however , that "" continuing with the pressure track of these past years will strengthen the belief in a significant part of the Iranian public that the United States is not genuinely interested in resolving the conflict "" ."
2013-08-15,"Iran 's conservative - dominated parliament has approved most of the cabinet ministers selected by the country 's new moderate president , Hassan Rouhani .
After four days of parliamentary debates and 18 proposed ministers grilled by MPs , the parliament issued its verdict on Thursday by giving vote of confidence to 15 nominees .
Mohammad Javaz Zarif , a US - educated veteran Iranian diplomat previously involved in secret Tehran - Washington talks , was confirmed as the country 's new foreign minister and Bijan Zanganeh as the oil minister .
Key positions in the new cabinet are now held by technocrats and pro - reform moderates .
Rouhani had presented his cabinet wish - list to parliament on the day he was sworn in , 4 August , in order to show his determination to solve Iran 's many problems amid financial stringency at home and international crisis abroad .
Only three nominees were blocked , including Mohammad Ali Najafi and Jafar Mili Monfared , who were rejected apparently because of their past support for the opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , who are currently under house arrest .
The parliamentary debates , broadcast live on state television for the first time in four days , were dominated by the question of whether the nominees supported the popular uprising in the aftermath of the 2009 "" rigged "" election , dubbed as "" sedition "" by Iranian hardliners .
Conservatives close to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , including Keyhan newspapers , had asked MPs to reject those nominees who had endorsed "" the sedition "" .
In his speech to parliament Rouhani expressed his "" condolences "" to the Egyptian people and warned the country 's army not to suppress them . ""
The great people of Egypt are a great and freedom - seeking people .
Do not suppress them .
The way of the people is the way of democracy and Islam .
Everyone in the world should respect the wishes of the Egyptian people , "" he said .
Rouhani has been criticised by human rights activists for his choice of justice minister , Mostafa Pourmohammadi .
Human Rights Watch and the New York - based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said this week that Pourmohammadi was implicated in human rights abuses and execution of political prisoners after the 1979 Islamic revolution . ""
Pourmohammadi 's nomination would be not only a blow to all those who fight against impunity in Iran , but also one more act of humiliation for the families of the journalists and dissidents killed or tortured while he was in office , "" said Lucie Morillon , head of the research department at Reporters Without Borders .
"" One should not underestimate the chilling effect his nomination could have on the ability of journalists and news providers to independently and effectively inform the public . """
2013-08-30,"The first visit by a foreign leader to Iran since Hassan Rouhani assumed the presidency came earlier this week with the arrival of Oman 's sultan , Qaboos bin Said Al Said .
Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iran 's new foreign minister , officially greeted Sultan Qaboos at Tehran 's Mehrabad Airport on Sunday , and then saw him off personally on Tuesday .
While the sultanate , which lies across the Gulf of Oman from Iran , has limited geopolitical importance , its ruler 's trip received heavy coverage in the Iranian media – a level of attention no doubt amplified by the fact that it came amid the dog days of the Tehran summer .
Stories spread that there was a secret agenda to his meetings with Iranian officials , involving claims that he came to convey messages from the United States and then to relay Iran 's response to White House officials .
According to the principlist website Asr - e Iran , Qaboos is supposed to set the stage for indirect negotiations between Iran and the United States .
Iranian media outlets , before and after the sultan 's visit , have claimed that he has received provisional US approval for his proposals .
The daily Khorasan newspaper reported that Qaboos carried a proposition under which Iran would be readmitted to the Swift international money transfer system in exchange for a reduction in its nuclear enrichment activities .
For almost a year and a half , Iranian banks have been unable to execute most international financial transactions due to the country 's exclusion from Swift , and the state has been blocked from accessing the estimated 60 to 80 billion dollars it has on deposit in various overseas banks .
On Tuesday , a foreign desk correspondent at one of Tehran 's reformist dailies said he believed the reports were credible , "" Otherwise why would Rouhani lavish his ' first foreign dignitary to visit ' honor on Sultan Qaboos ?
And do n't forget that Zarif both greeted him and escorted him off .
He is the person in charge of Iran 's nuclear program . ""
The reformist correspondent pointed out a breaking news item from the Iranian Labor News Agency , reporting that Zarif has confirmed that the "" guesses "" made by the media have been largely correct and that Qaboos had traveled to Tehran in the role of a mediator carrying communications . ""
During his visit to Iran , the sultan of Oman described his own takes on the positions of US officials and he will convey our position to them , "" the foreign minister was quoted as saying .
"" As I had expressed before , as Iran and the US do n't have a direct link , when our friends travel to Iran , the usually explicate their takes on the positions of US officials and their tendencies . ""
The reporter also cautioned , however , "" If you wish to call these ' exchanging messages , ' then feel free to do so .
I would n't call it that as that expression has a specific meaning in foreign relations . ""
Zarif 's statement marks a major shift in how the Foreign Ministry has addressed Qaboos 's visit .
In the days leading up to his arrival , outgoing ministry spokesman Abbas Iraqchi regularly dismissed the suggestion that the Omani ruler was carrying a message for Tehran as "" spinning tales . . .
attempts by the foreign media to foul the positive climate that has appeared from the change of government .
Regrettably , some domestic media get trapped in such webs . ""
On Thursday , it was announced that Iraqchi would be replaced by career diplomat Marzieh Afkham , the first woman to serve as Foreign Ministry spokeswoman .
A Tehran - based Green Movement activist had mixed feelings about the utility of such mediated exchanges between Iran and the United States .
"" Such mediations lead nowhere , existentially , "" he said .
"" The enmity and grievances harbored by each side toward the other can only be solved and resolved through hours of intensive labour at the negotiation table .
But Sultan Qaboos 's conciliations are necessary .
He knows his role well .
He had done some very good work in the past . ""
In an interview with the website Iranian Diplomacy , Siavash Zargar Yaqobi , former ambassador to Oman and India , expressed a hopeful outlook with less ambivalence . ""
This trip will certainly have a very positive effect in reducing tensions in Iran 's relationship with the west and especially the US , "" he said .
"" Oman 's history of mediation in Iran 's issues and difficulties with the west shows that Oman has been able to play a positive role in this regards and we can probably expect that this trip will also be effective in this area . ""
When tensions rose between the Ahmadinejad and Blair governments in late March 2007 over the arrest of British marines in Iran 's Persian Gulf waters , Oman played a significant role in arranging for their release .
Qaboos also played a central role in negotiating the return home of the three US hikers who were detained on espionage charges in the summer of 2009 .
In the 1980s , worked hard to arbitrate peace between Iran and Iraq during their eight - year - long war .
Heshmat , a 60-year - old carpet merchant in south - central Tehran , reflected one popular take on Qaboos 's trip . ""
May God bless the father of this Sultan so - and - so should he be able to reconcile these two , "" he told Tehran Bureau . ""
God as witness , they are quibbling over nothing and nonsense .
Iran needs the US ; so does the US need Iran .
Iran should back down , and the US too , should back down .
Someone should act as the wise man and undo this knot .
With these sanctions , they 've got our fathers rolling in their graves .
God believe me , nobody wants to build a bomb .
Make up and get on with your lives .
Is n't it a waste that two nations who only 30 years ago were like brothers go after each other 's throats like this ? ""
A few steps up the street from the carpet shop , Hossein , who organises Basij militia activities at a mosque in the area , argued that Iran is in no need of a mediator .
Referring to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by one of his common epithets , the Farsi for "" sir , "" Hossein said , "" Either Agha wants negotiation between them or he does n't .
If he wants , he will say so , clear and direct .
If he does n't , then there is no need for shuttling messages . ""
Tehran Bureau 's Nuclear Watch series monitors the way the Iranian media reports the country 's nuclear programme"
2013-09-05,"Amid a global exchange of greetings and good wishes to mark Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish new year , which began at sunset on Wednesday , there was one from a particularly surprising quarter .
Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , tweeted : "" As the sun is about to set here in # Tehran I wish all Jews , especially Iranian Jews , a blessed Rosh Hashanah . ""
A picture of an Iranian Jew praying at a synagogue in Tehran accompanied the tweet .
According to a 2012 census , there are fewer than 9,000 Jews among Iran 's population of about 75 million .
The message from Rouhani was unexpected in Israel , which has identified Iran as a huge threat to its security .
It says the regime is developing a nuclear weapons programme that could be used to annihilate the Jewish state .
Rouhani , who was elected in June , has pledged to tone down the "" hate rhetoric "" used by his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Barack Obama , also sent new year greetings to Jews around the world , wishing them "" shana tova "" from the Great Synagogue in Stockholm during a stopover en route to the G20 summit in St Petersburg .
Other wellwishers included the British prime minister , David Cameron , who sent "" best wishes to Jewish communities in the UK and around the world observing the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur "" .
His message continued : "" At this important time for the Jewish faith let us join you in praying for a new year that will achieve progress towards a lasting peace for Israel and the Middle East . ""
Rosh Hashanah marks the start of the year 5774 in the Jewish calendar and about a month of religious holidays .
Yom Kippur , the solemn day of atonement and fasting for Jews , begins at sunset next Friday .
It is followed by Sukkot , or the Feast of the Tabernacles , an eight - day holiday in which observant Jews take meals in a sukkah , an outdoor structure traditionally covered in palm fronds ."
2013-09-06,"Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , 79 , has been written off more than most .
But the former president and head of the expediency council remains an astute operator , and my guess is that he has chosen his ground carefully in calling for a reappraisal of Iran 's unblinking support for the regime of Bashar al - Assad .
In saying Assad 's forces were responsible for using chemicals weapons in Damascus in an attack on 21 August , Rafsanjani has surely judged this a good issue for the first serious clash between pragmatists and more "" hardline "" forces since Hassan Rouhani , a Rafsanjani ally , took over as president a month ago .
While a clash was inevitable sooner or later - and while Rouhani still has the aura of June 's overwhelming election victory - it has arrived quickly , and reflects how delicate a time it is in the Middle East as the United States ponders its first direct military involvement in the Syrian war .
The public argument within Iran 's political class reflects a wider disagreement in Tehran over regional policy and the prospect of talks with Washington about the nuclear programme .
There are many in Tehran who would love to undermine Rouhani 's calls for dialogue as means of reaching a compromise over the nuclear programme and reducing region - wide tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims being brought to boiling point by violent chaos in Syria .
Whatever Iran 's longstanding alliance with Assad and whatever the imperatives of maintaining logistical support to Hezbollah , Iran has a strong public policy of opposition to chemical weapons .
The deaths of 20,000 Iranian soldiers and the continuing suffering of around 100,000 Iranians from the use of chemicals by Iraq during the 1980 - 88 war are well known in the country .
They are often highlighted on state television .
And while Iran 's link to Assad remains strategic , the conflict is clearly worsening relations with Sunni Arab states .
Shia are deeply aware â€ “
it is intrinsic to the origins of the faith â€ “ of their minority status .
Takiyya , the doctrine that holds that beliefs can be disguised in certain circumstances in order to protect the faithful from danger , came about because the Shia can not win any all - out conflict .
The calculation of the pragmatists is surely that the longer the Syria war lasts , the greater the prospect that the fall of Assad .
This would at the very least leave Tehran facing a new regime in Damascus , from which it and Hezbollah are deeply alienated , or perhaps a mess with little of a regime to speak of .
Violence in the region has proved deeply unpredictable .
Think of Russia 's 1979 - 89 war in Afghanistan , of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , of 9/11 , of Hezbollah 's action in Beirut in 2008 .
Syria could produce even greater genies that can not be replaced in any bottle .
In Beirut , a friend told me of "" whole Syrian families glad to find a branch of a tree on the airport road where they can shelter "" .
Many Iraqi Christians who fled to Syria to escape Sunni sectarian "" cleansing "" have returned to face uncertainties in their homeland , and some reports say 150,000 Syrian Christians fleeing Sunni violence are under effective siege in a "" valley of Christians "" in the west .
These are the lucky ones .
Rafsanjani 's speech reflects a view that Iran should work for a diplomatic compromise .
He broke from earlier claims from officials including Mohammad Javad Zarif , the foreign minister , and Abbas Araghchi , then foreign ministry spokesman , that rebels and not the Assad regime had used the chemicals .
Rafsanjani 's speech also acknowledged the weaknesses of Iran 's position â€ “ especially in being unable to sell , or to receive payments for , oil .
This was a brave move , as it carries that risk that some in Washington will argue once again that with Iran "" weakening "" , confrontation and force can produce a new dawn for pax Americana in the region .
It is hard not to think Rafsanjani is acting as a stalking horse for the president .
But even Rouhani , in condemning the use of chemical weapons and calling for international action , did not attribute culpability to either side .
And in changing tack after initial comments , Zarif argued that with "" no proof "" that the Syrian government was responsible , culpability should be established internationally before any action taken .
Rafsanjani has led from the front .
One western diplomat told me back in February that the outlines of a Syrian agreement , tied in to a wider regional settlement , were apparent , even though the political difficulties in achieving them were acute .
"" Everybody 's had to go with the Shia - majority dominance of Iraq , and in Syria , we are prepared to accept similar logic , "" he said .
And if this were to be the outcome , he continued , it would be better achieved round a table than through unpredictable violence .
Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Iran , he argued , needed to front a deal , backed by the US and Russia , that would accept majority Sunni rule in Syria with minority rights , and Shia - rule in Iraq with minority rights .
But even then , the diplomat was not optimistic .
"" The stars are not aligned to allow that to happen , "" he said .
The effects of US strikes on possibilities for diplomacy are unknown , and yet the diplomatic doors remain slightly ajar .
There was considerable speculation in Tehran at the end of August that a visit by Qaboos bin Said Al Said , the leader of Oman , was intended to help start low - profile talks between Iran and the US .
The daily Khorasan reported the Sultan had brought a proposal for Iran to be readmitted to the international money - transfer system
Swift if it reduced uranium enrichment .
And this came after the visit of Jeffrey Feltman , the UN under - secretary general and former senior US diplomat and ex - Lebanon ambassador , ostensibly to discuss the UN interest in Syria , Egypt and Lebanon .
The "" leaking "" of details of the Qaboos visit â€ “ possibly by conservative elements opposed to talks with the US â€ “ may have reflected the disagreements within Iranian politics .
The visit , or indeed the leak itself , may have prompted Rafsanjani 's intervention over chemical weapons .
"" One can not be sure of anything , "" an analyst in Tehran said .
"" Once the first Tomahawk missile takes flight , everybody is in the dark as to what happens next .
Curiously in all this the collective political establishment of the West too , seems to be viewing the coming crisis like a deer caught in the headlights .
We will have to wait and see what the next two weeks or so will bring : war or the greatest political stepping back from the brink of war the world will have ever seen the Americans take . ""
The pragmatists in Tehran may be judging that Syria is taking the region in a direction where pragmatism will be submerged â€ “ "" burned "" would be a better word â€ “ by militarists and those on all sides who blame others for everything .
If so , then Rafsanjani is telling pragmatists in Washington and Europe and the Sunni Arab establishment that there are those in Iran who want to talk .
Rouhani and Rafsanjani await a response ."
2013-09-09,"The newly elected administration of Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , has embraced Facebook and Twitter in a public challenge to online censorship as authorities begin to debate whether a ban on the social networking websites should be lifted .
An increasing number of Rouhani 's cabinet members – including the foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , and the oil minister , Bijan Zanganeh – have become active online since Rouhani was sworn in last month , even though access to most of the major social networks including Facebook remains blocked across the country .
The move , which heralds a new era in the Iranian government 's engagement with its citizens , has raised hopes of an easing of internet - related regulations .
Rouhani has maintained a presence on social media since the election campaign , posting on Twitter last week a Rosh Hashanah blessing for the Jewish new year .
He has made public his opposition to internet censorship , describing it as futile , but does not have authority to rescind it alone .
On Monday Iran 's judiciary spokesman , Gholam - Hossein Mohseni - Ejei , was asked by reporters in Tehran whether the filtering of Facebook content would be lifted in the light of ministers ' membership of the site .
He said it could only be lifted if the state committee charged with determining offensive content ruled that it was no longer offensive , the conservative website Khabaronline reported .
Marzieh Afkhami , spokeswoman for Iran 's foreign ministry , said in a Facebook status update that Zarif 's online activities had encouraged her to join the site .
Zarif 's first day on Twitter grabbed headlines last week when he said his country did not deny the Holocaust .
Responding to a tweet by Christine Pelosi , the daughter of the US politician Nancy Pelosi , who had told the Iranian minister that the Jewish new year "" would have been sweeter "" if Iran ended its Holocaust denial , Zarif posted : "" Iran never denied it .
The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone .
Happy New Year . ""
Zarif was referring to the former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The US - educated foreign minister has more than 15,000 followers on Twitter and more than 160,000 fans on Facebook , posting in English in the former and Persian in the latter .
Zarif stirred a debate on Facebook when asking his fans about the situation in Syria , often receiving messages contrary to his .
Many users have joked with Zarif and other ministers about the kind of anti - filtering software or VPN account they use to access Facebook and Twitter .
Iran 's internet big brother , the supreme council on cyberspace , was set up last year at the request of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , to police the activities of Iranians online .
A number of cabinet ministers sit on the council and Rouhani chairs it
but they do not necessarily have the final say as it also includes members of other institutions including parliament and the elite Revolutionary Guards .
Last week an official told Iran 's semi - official Fars news agency that the committee charged with determining offensive content , which works under the council , would study and assess the ministers ' Facebook pages .
Elham Aminzadeh , the president 's legal adviser , also signalled that the government would determine whether membership of social networks was banned for ministers and government representatives .
Since Rouhani 's victory , users in Iran have reported an increase in internet connection speeds .
Access to VPN accounts has also been restored .
Iranians who could not access Skype because the internet was too slow before the election now say that it works ."
2013-09-11,"Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi have seen an improvement in the conditions of their house arrest as hopes grow for their release .
Since Hassan Rouhani took office as Iran 's new president last month the two men , who have been held for more than two years without being put on trial , have been treated better by the security guards and allowed more frequent family visits .
Karroubi 's son , Mohammad Taghi , told the Guardian on Wednesday that both leaders have been dealt with in a positive fashion recently as news emerges that Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has agreed that the country 's supreme national security council can decide on their fate . ""
The supreme leader has agreed for the council to handle the issue regarding their house arrests , "" he said .
"" We have received this news from a reliable source . ""
Mousavi and Karroubi , both former presidential candidates who alleged the results were rigged in Iran 's 2009 election , were placed under house arrest in mid - February 2011 when they called for street protests in solidarity with pro - democracy movements in Egypt and Tunisia .
Hardliners in Iran refer to the two as leaders of "" sedition "" .
Mousavi is currently held in his own house in Tehran along with his wife , Zahra Rahnavard , also an outspoken critic , while Karroubi has been removed from home and taken to a house belonging to security officials .
Karroubi 's wife , Fatemeh , who was also placed under house arrest , has since been released .
Both men are suffering from various medical complications partly due to their age : both of them are over 70 and have been taken to hospital in recent months .
Mohammad Taghi Karroubi said doctors trusted by the leaders ' families have recently been allowed to examine them , unlike in the past when only doctors chosen by the authorities were permitted to treat them .
Increased optimism about the leaders ' release also stem from the appointment this week of Ali Shamkhani , a moderate , to head the supreme national security council , which will decide on the matter of the house arrests .
On Tuesday Rouhani appointed Shamkhani , a former defence minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami , as the security council 's new chief .
Shamkhani refused to condemn Mousavi and Karroubi after 2009 and is believed to be moderately sympathetic to the reformists .
Public demands for the leaders ' release has heightened since Rouhani 's victory in Iran 's election this year , with senior politicians including Khatami and Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani highlighting their cases .
Hardline politicians have signalled that any decision on their situation rests in the hands of Khamenei .
Despite the developments , Mohammad Taghi Karroubi said he did not think the authorities would release his father any time soon unless they decided to release other political prisoners as well .
Earlier this year six prominent human rights organisations urged Tehran to end the "" arbitrary "" house arrests of the two veteran politicians ."
2013-09-12,"The news came in a low - key , brief statement from Hassan Rouhani 's public relations office : "" The president has handed the responsibility for nuclear negotiations with foreign nations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . ""
No longer would the Iranian side be led by the Supreme National Security Council ( SNSC ) .
Within hours of the announcement , Catherine Ashton , the European Union foreign policy chief , announced she had contacted Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iran 's new foreign minister , and agreed to meet on the sidelines of the UN meeting in New York later this month .
Ashton co - ordinates the ' 5 + 1 ' â€ “ the permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany â€ “ who have been in largely fruitless talks with Iran over its nuclear programme for seven years .
The last round was in Istanbul in May.
Iranian negotiators have been led since 2003 by the Secretary of the SNSC , at that time none other than Rouhani , who took Iran into two years of negotiations with the European Union during which Tehran suspended all uranium enrichment before a tentative , preliminary agreement broke down .
Rouhani 's new move is partly to create a clearer decision - structure but also reflects his confidence in Zarif , who is US - educated as well as known to many US politicians , including vice - president Joe Biden , from his stint in New York from 2002 to 2007 as Iran 's UN representative . ""
Having a new foreign minister , the first to be respected internationally in three decades , and also a quick decision - making process between him and the president , this is the only workable way to tackle the crippling nuclear crisis , "" said Kourosh Zaim , a leading member of the opposition National Front party in Tehran .
In the reformist press , Samira Farahbakhsh argued in Mardom Salaarie ( Democracy ) that Zarif was "" held in high esteem "" by western diplomats given his "" relatively comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of Western players "" .
It has also been argued it was important for Rouhani to put talks under a diplomatic rather than a security rubric .
Iran Diplomacy , a website associated with Sadegh Kharrazi , former ambassador to both the UN and France , has posted an article headlined The End of Viewing Nuclear Negotiations a Security Issue , suggesting the move "" tells foreigners that Iran has changed the character of the issue from one of security to diplomatic / political , and that they should reconsider their stance as well ...
[as understanding ] the Iranian side is looking for a win - win outcome "" .
Kharrazi is close to Zarif , and the pair worked together closely on the 2003 Grand Bargain offer to the United States , an initiative ignored by the Bush administration .
The article reiterates Kharrazi 's experience that Iran requires a positive response from Washington : "" Of course , the transfer of the dossier from SNSC to the foreign ministry does n't necessarily suggest that Iran will step back from its [ claim to ] legal rights [ for nuclear development under the Nuclear Non - Proliferation treaty ] , or that this impasse will be resolved and overcome quickly .
Resolution of such an impasse depends on the political will of all sides , and for as long as such a will does n't exist , then the best decision - making systems and the most astute diplomats will produce nothing . ""
But domestically at least , Rouhani seems to have the momentum with him after his overwhelming presidential election victory in June .
When he held talks with the Europeans between 2003 and 2005 , Rouhani and his negotiating team were subject to stinging attacks in the conservative press .
So far , as president Rouhani has experienced nothing of the sort .
In 2003 - 05 the Kayhan newspaper led the way with a series of critical editorials by Hossein Shariatmadari , who as editor - in - chief is an appointee of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
In reacting to the transfer of the nuclear file to the foreign ministry , the paper has simply noted the move , offering no immediate analysis or opinion .
Similarly , Resalat , a daily close to the right - leaning Motalefeh ( coalition ) Party , has chosen silence .
Raja News , a website staunchly in support of the still SNSC secretary and defeated presidential candidate Saeed Jalili , has also been mute , prompting speculation in Tehran that Ayatollah Khamenei 's office has advised editors not to criticise Rouhani at a delicate time in international affairs .
Not that the SNSC is entirely out of the picture .
In an interview with the semi - governmental Mehr News Agency , Zarif said talks would be carried out "" in consultations with the SNSC and other relevant organs "" .
Marzieh Afkham , the first female spokeswoman for the foreign ministry , has also spoken of "" necessary co - ordination "" with the SNSC .
One editor - in - chief of a reformist publication told Tehran Bureau he was sceptical about the whole move . ""
It seems to me that decision - making will remain with the council , "" he said .
"" The foreign affairs ministry can only execute the council 's decisions .
We have to see if the negotiation strategy will change , or just the faces of the negotiators . ""
But the editor did concede that Zarif is "" a truly powerful negotiator "" .
Zaim , a long - term critic of the Iranian authorities , was even more optimistic in foreseeing a "" U - turn in IRI foreign diplomacy from hard - headedness and stupidity to some sort of wisdom "" .
Zaim added that he hoped Rouhani and Zarif would be given room â€ “ at home and abroad â€ “ to find solutions . ""
This turnabout of course is a good sign and we hope it will bear positive results provided the 5 + 1 also approach the upcoming negotiations with [ an ] intent to resolve the crisis , "" he said .
"" I believe the Supreme Leader is taking a back seat in this process , because it is a do or die proposition . ""
A professor in Iran told Tehran Bureau he was delighted to see the end of Saeed Jalili 's responsibility for handling the nuclear talks . ""
He never learned anything about diplomatic protocols except for his mistimed and misplaced smiles .
I can truly call Jalili the most incapable Iranian diplomat since the Qajar dynasty [ 1779 - 1924 ] .

2013-09-13,"Iran 's main film industry guild has reopened , almost two years after it was closed by hardliners , reports the state news agency , Irna .
The demise of the House of Cinema was criticised by high - profile directors such as Asghar Farhadi , whose film , A Separation , won the 2012 Oscar for best foreign - language film .
The reopening could signal a change in attitude towards film under the leadership of new Iranian president Hassan Rouhani , who is seen as more moderate than his predecessor and has hinted at a greater tolerance on cultural issues .
The guild , which has more than 5,000 members from all corners of the Iranian film industry , was closed in January 2012 after being accused of changing its statutes without consulting officials .
Deputy culture minister Hojatollah Ayoubi criticised the closure and confirmed that the decision indicated the new president 's support for local directors . ""
When a cultural issue – like the one about the House of Cinema – becomes a political one , that is [ because ] the situation was not managed properly , "" he told Irna .
The reopening will raise hopes that Iran 's best - known film - maker , Jafar Panahi , might soon benefit from the country 's increasing tolerance .
Panahi , the celebrated director of The White Balloon and Offside , is currently under house arrest for defying authorities with his films .
He was banned from making films for 20 years and sentenced to six years in prison in December 2010 .

2013-09-15,"An exchange of letters between Barack Obama and the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , has set the stage for a possible meeting between the two men at the UN next week in what would be the first face - to - face encounter between a US and Iranian leader since Iran 's 1979 revolution .
Britain 's foreign secretary , William Hague , is also due to meet his Iranian counterpart , Mohammad Javad Zarif , at the UN general assembly meeting in New York , adding to guarded optimism that the June election of Rouhani , a Glasgow - educated moderate , and his appointment of a largely pragmatic cabinet , has opened the door to a diplomatic solution to the 11-year international standoff over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Tehran took the Foreign Office by surprise , tweeting on Rouhani 's English - language feed that the president would also be prepared to meet Hague , something the UK had not even requested .
"" Tehran has responded positively to UK 's request .
President Rouhani 's meeting w / WilliamJHague on the sidelines of UNGA has been confirmed , "" the tweet said .
"" We would be happy to meet , "" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said , "" but we have had nothing formal from Tehran about it . ""
Diplomats said that the tweet reflected the new Iranian government 's eagerness to make diplomatic headway on the nuclear issue , which has been at an impasse for several years .
A Hague meeting with either Rouhani or Zarif could clear the way to restoring full diplomatic ties , which have not existed since the British embassy in Tehran was ransacked by a mob in November 2011 .
In a television interview aired on Sunday , Obama made clear that there was a diplomatic opening with Iran , not only over the nuclear question but also over Syria .
He confirmed earlier reports that he and Rouhani had "" reached out "" to each other , exchanging letters .
US officials were sceptical about a Rouhani meeting , but some observers said the Geneva deal on Syria 's chemical weapons has opened new space for global diplomacy .
Trita Parsi , head of the National Iranian American Council and an expert on US - Iran diplomacy , said "" I think there is a chance [ of a meeting ] .
It would be a strong political push for movement .
If Obama got involved , it would be the infusion of political will needed to reach an agreement .
"" Tehran is already claiming some of the credit for the Syria deal .
Rouhani needs to show that through his diplomatic efforts he has already avoided a war .
He is desperate in his first six months to show his approach has paid more dividends than the hardline approach of his predecessor . ""
Parsi added that if Obama was to meet Rouhani it was likely to be an orchestrated encounter in a corridor , rather than a sit - down talk , "" to give both sides deniability "" .
The last encounter between an American and Iranian leader was when Jimmy Carter met the Shah , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , in 1977 .
Speaking on ABC 's This Week , Obama raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised "" that what 's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region "" .
He said the Geneva deal could pave the way for more general talks involving Russia and Iran aimed at "" some sort of political settlement that would deal with the underlying terrible conflict "" .
In the same interview , Obama also urged Iran 's leadership not to draw the wrong lessons from his decision to draw back from air strikes on Syria in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis .
He said it showed that it was possible to resolve the standoff over Iran 's nuclear aspirations peacefully , but insisted it did not indicate a weakening of US resolve to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
"" I think what the Iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue , that the threat against … Israel that a nuclear Iran poses is much closer to our core interests .
That a nuclear arms race in the region is something that would be profoundly destabilising , "" Obama said in the ABC interview , which was recorded on Friday , before a final Syria deal with Russia was struck in Geneva .
"" My suspicion is that the Iranians recognise they should n't draw a lesson that [ because ] we have n't struck to think we wo n't strike Iran , "" Obama said , in remarks that may also have been intended as a reassurance to Israel that US deterrence against any Iranian attempt to build nuclear weapons had not been weakened .
After meeting John Kerry , US secretary of state , the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , stressed the same point . ""
The determination the international community shows regarding Syria will have a direct impact on the Syrian regime 's patron – Iran , "" Netanyahu said .
"" Iran must understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons , "" he added .
However , Obama insisted : "" What they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically .
You know , negotiations with the Iranians are always difficult .
I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy .
But you know , my view is that … if you have both a credible threat of force , combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort , that , in fact you can strike a deal . """
2013-09-15,"Shirin Gerami , a 24-year - old woman from Iran , has made history by becoming the country 's first female triathlete to have taken part in the sport 's world championship .
By racing in the London event , she paved the way and set a precedent for thousands of Iranian women who have previously been denied permission to race in triathlons abroad or swim in international events .
Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , greeted her achievement by tweeting : "" Shirin Gerami,1st female triathlete to have participated in world championship wearing Iran 's colours # GenderEquality .
"" Gerami raced in full Islamic dress after Iran 's sports ministry issued required paperwork in the last hours before the final began .
The Islamic republic 's state news agency , Irna , quoted Mohammad - Ali Sabour , the head of Iran 's national triathlon federation , saying that Gerami had secured an official blessing and was nominated after the International Triathlon Union ( ITU ) agreed to set up a tent where she could change into her cycling and running clothes after swimming .
In her first interview before the grand final , Gerami on Thursday told the Guardian she received the go - ahead after spending four months trying to persuade the Iranian authorities that she wanted to respect their Islamic requirements . ""
Triathlon … is still not very established in Iran ; to date women do not participate in triathlons , "" she said .
"" I wanted to share triathlon , and all the empowerment it has given me , with others and encourage others to experience and benefit from something that is dear to me . ""
She insisted she wanted to tell "" the other story of Iran "" , that positive stories about her home country do exist .
"" I wanted to show that what people dismiss as impossible is actually possible , and this universal rule applies to all countries , to all people . """
2013-09-15,"Barack Obama on Sunday sought to shore up the potency of American deterrence in the Middle East , warning Iran that he was still prepared to take military action against the Iranian nuclear programme , which the president described as "" much closer to our core interests "" than Syria 's chemical weapons .
But at the same time , Obama presented the Geneva deal on Syria as an opportunity to bolster diplomacy with Tehran a week ahead of the first official visit to the US by the newly - elected Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani .
Obama made a point of inviting Iranian involvement in international talks about a broader settlement to the Syrian conflict , something Washington had previously resisted .
Speaking on ABC News television , Obama revealed that he had exchanged letters on the Syrian crisis with Rouhani , a moderate elected in June , and raised the prospect of Iran participation in global diplomacy on Syria if Tehran recognised "" that what 's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but destabilising the entire region "" .

2013-09-17,"Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has given the clearest signal yet that the country 's newly elected president and moderate cleric , Hassan Rouhani , has the authority to conduct direct talks with the US and offer compromises in nuclear talks .
Khamanei told the Islamic republic 's revolutionary guards there was room for leniency in diplomacy .
"" Diplomacy is the field of smiling and requests for talks , "" he said on Tuesday in a speech delivered to senior commanders of the elite forces in Tehran , according to his official website .
"" I 'm not opposed to proper moves in diplomacy , and I still believe in what I named years ago as champion 's leniency . ""
As the supreme leader , the 74-year - old Ayatollah has the final say in all state matters , especially those concerning direct negotiations with the US , which Tehran considers its sworn enemy , and any major agreements about the country 's nuclear programme .
In diplomacy , he said , one should have the flexibility of a wrestler : one may at times have to give way for tactical reasons but should never forget who is the "" rival and enemy "" .
By referring to "" champion 's leniency "" , Khamenei was invoking the subtitle of a book he has translated from Arabic called Imam Hassan 's Peace , which is about how the second Shia imam , Hasan ibn Ali , averted war by showing flexibility and entering an agreement with his enemy 14 centuries ago .
Khamenei was speaking a few days after it emerged that the US president , Barack Obama , had exchanged letters with Rouhani raising chances of a historic meeting between the two men at the UN general assembly next week and possible high - level meetings between Tehran and Washington in future .
Iran 's foreign ministry spokeswoman , Marzieh Afkham , confirmed on Tuesday that letters had been exchanged , saying Obama had written to Rouhani congratulating him on his election victory , and Rouhani had responded .
Seyed Hossein Mousavian , a former Iranian nuclear official who worked as Rouhani 's deputy in Iran 's supreme national security council from 1997 to 2005 , wrote in an article last week that Khamenei has given consent for direct talks with the Obama administration . ""
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued permission for President Hassan Rouhani 's new administration to enter into direct talks with the US , "" he wrote in the Japan Times . ""
No better opportunity to end decades of bilateral hostility is likely to come along . ""
Khamenei told the guards , who are accused by the west of largely supporting Bashar al - Assad 's regime in Syria both militarily and financially , that they should stay away from politics . ""
It is not necessary for the guards to have activities in the political field , "" he said , echoing Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini , the late founder of the Islamic republic , who banned the elite forces from involvement in politics after the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Despite this , the guards have been extensively involved in Iranian politics recently , especially under the eight - year rule of the former president , Mahmoud Ahmadinajd , during which time they expanded their political and financial operations .
Khamenei 's words echoed those of Rouhani on Monday , when he asked the guards to "" stay above and beyond political currents "" , and warned them against competing with the will of the people .
Khamenei 's warning came as new video footage allegedly showing Iranian guards in Syria aiding the Assad forces was released by a Dutch television programme .
It was unclear whether Khamenei was attempting to curb the guards ' power , fearing it may have got out of hand , or whether he was asking them not to cause difficulties for Rouhani 's administration , should it choose to compromise over Tehran 's nuclear dossier .
Khamenei reiterated that Iran was not seeking to make an atomic bomb .
"" We are against nuclear weapons , not because of the US or other countries , but because of our beliefs , "" he said .
"" And when we say no one should have nuclear weapons , we definitely do not pursue it ourselves either .
"" Iran 's former foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi , who has been reinstated as the head of the country 's atomic energy agency by Rouhani , said at the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in Vienna this week that Tehran was ready to "" end the so - called nuclear file "" .
Iran 's nuclear dossier , previously under the control of hardliners , has been transferred to the foreign ministry at the request of Rouhani .
Iran 's foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , who is travelling to New York with Rouhani , is scheduled to meet the EU 's foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , and the British foreign secretary , William Hague , but it is unclear when and where the new round of nuclear talks will be held ."
2013-09-18,"Iran 's most prominent human rights activist was released from jail on Wednesday along with several other political prisoners in what appears to be the most tangible sign of change yet under the new Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani .
Ahead of Rouhani 's eagerly awaited visit to the UN general assembly in New York next week , Nasrin Sotoudeh , who has been likened to Aung San Suu Kyi , was driven from Evin prison in Tehran to her house in another part of the Iranian capital and told she did not need to return to jail . ""
They were quite certain this time that I 'm freed
and I do n't need to go back , "" the 50-year - old women 's rights activist told the Guardian by phone from her home .
Opposition website Kaleme reported on Wednesday that seven other women political prisoners had also been released in the previous 24 hours , including the dissident journalist Mahsa Amrabadi , and at least four men , including reformist politicians Feizollah Arabsorkhi , Mirtaher Mousavi and former deputy foreign minister Mohsen Aminzadeh . ""
In the past , when I was granted prison leave they used to give me a document , this time they gave me nothing , "" said Sotoudeh , who last October was awarded the European parliament 's most prestigious human rights award , the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought , which has previously been won by Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela .
"" My goals and mentality are the same as before , I have n't changed , "" Sotoudeh insisted , adding that like other lawyers she would still work "" to restore justice and defend the rights of protesters "" .
The prisoner releases have come amid increasing signs of a political opening - up in the Islamic republic following Rouhani 's inauguration last month and as he prepares for his UN visit , which many have suggested may be the scene for a historic meeting between the Iranian president and Barack Obama .
Iran 's supreme leader on Tuesday struck a conciliatory tone by saying there was room for flexibility in diplomacy , which many have interpreted as his public backing for Rouhani 's new attempt to improve Iran 's relations with the west , especially conducting direct talks with the US .
Iranians , reacting on social networks , linked the releases to Khamenei 's talk of "" leniency "" on Tuesday .
In the light of recent developments in Iran , its national currency , the rial , has steadily recovered value against the dollar .
The UK foreign secretary , William Hague , welcomed the news .
He said : "" I welcome reports that a number of Iranian political prisoners , including human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh , have been released from prison today .
This will come as a great relief to their families and supporters around the world .
The UK hopes to see further improvements in Iran 's human rights record under President Rouhani 's new government . ""
Suzanne Maloney , an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington , said there has been a fear Rouhani would be more impressive with his rhetoric than actions but the release of prisoners provided another piece of evidence that he would be different .
"" At least we can see that the president is following through on his campaign promises , and that this election is having tangible , positive impact on the lives of individual Iranians .
As Iran 's delegation arrives in New York …
Rouhani 's international credibility will be strengthened by these developments .
""
Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group echoed Maloney .
"" The Iranian government is paving the ground for Rouhani 's arrival on the world stage .
Undoubtedly , combining concrete actions with words enhances the new president 's credibility and proves that he can deliver on his promises . ""
However Trita Parsi , the president of the National Iranian American Council , warned : "" If the west fails to appreciate Rouhani 's flexibility now , it will have to deal with the inflexibility of the conservatives in a few months . ""
The country 's opposition leaders , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , have been under house arrest for more than two years .
But Karroubi 's son , Mohammad - Taghi , said last week the house arrests of the two men have been eased recently and they have been allowed more family visits .
Analysts believe the prisoner releases will pave the way for Mousavi and Karroubi to be granted their freedom .
Sotoudeh fell foul of the authorities after representing several political activists and highlighting the execution of juveniles in Iran .
After her arrest in September 2010 , she was initially sentenced to 11 years in jail for "" propaganda against the regime "" and "" acting against the national security "" , but an appeals court reduced the sentence to six years .
Prominent international human rights organisations have said that charges against Sotoudeh were fabricated and politically motivated .
While in jail , Sotoudeh , the mother of two , embarked twice on long hunger strikes in protest at the mistreatment of her 12-year - old daughter and her husband , Reza Khandan , at the hands of the authorities .
Sotoudeh lost both her parents while in prison .
She was not allowed to attend the funeral of her father , who died two weeks after she was arrested , but she was present at her mother 's burial ceremony for a few hours in December 2012 .
Faraz Sanei of Human Rights Watch welcomed Sotoudeh 's release , but added : "" The burden is on Tehran to prove that this is more than just a symbolic gesture .
"" If the Iranian government is truly serious about real reform it needs to take immediate and concrete steps leading to the unconditional release of hundreds of other political prisoners currently languishing in Iran 's prisons .
It also needs to ensure that those who are freed will not continue to suffer targeting at the hands of security forces and judicial authorities . """
2013-09-19,"For young Iranians accustomed to living under the repressive regime of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the past few days have felt very different indeed .
The release of 11 political prisoners , the temporary lifting of government filters on social networking sites , and the warming of Iran - US relations ahead of next week 's UN general assembly have brought new hope of ending Iran 's international isolation and improving the lives of ordianry citizens .
After years of seeing their personal freedoms and political demands quashed , young Iranians hope the efforts of the new government led by President Hassan Rouhani will create open up Iranian society and restore the country 's standing on the world stage .
"" I see hope in all of the unfolding events , "" says student Aryo , 18 .
"" If the country opens up , it will be good for everyone .
We will feel as a part of the world rather than an enemy everywhere we go . ""
Pirooz , a 29-year old artist , was delighted to discover that he could access his Facebook page â€ “ for a while â€ “ without bypassing government filters .
"" Looks like we 're not this exotic place any more , this black hole where the internet is blocked , "" he said after Facebook and Twitter became temporarily accessible on 16 September , leading to speculation that the government might be prepared to lift the myriad restrictions of personal freedoms to which young Iranians have grown accustomed during the Ahmadinejad years . ""
Of course , they wo n't permit [ social networking sites ] all the way , "" Pirooz said .
"" They can not just open up everything â€ “ there would be chaos .
But we 're starting to understand just how much pressure we were under . ""
The relaxation of restrictions on social networking sites , combined with the release of political prisoners , including human rights lawyer Nasrin Soutudeh , has led many of Iran 's young people to believe that the grievances they have voiced since the turbulent 2009 election , which led to months of bloody clashes between Green Movement demonstrators and government forces , are finally being heard by the new administration .
There is now growing hope for the release of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , two reformist candidates who were placed under house arrest following the 2009 unrest .
"" If they free Karroubi and Mousavi , there will be huge happiness in the streets , "" said Reza , 27 , a Green Movement activist .
Recent statements by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who in an 18 September address to the Revolutionary Guards urged "" heroic flexibility "" regarding Iran 's internal affairs , have also been a talking point .
"" It shows how bad and dangerous things have been for the country , that it got so bad he had to accept change , "" said Reza .
"" Rouhani has much more ability to act in the way he wants now .
Now , he has the opportunity to show the other face of Iranian politics . ""
The change in tone of Iranian politics , coupled with the recent communications between Iran and the United States ahead of the UN General Assembly in New York next week , has also raised confidence in a diplomatic solution to the conflict over Syria and over Iran 's controversial nuclear programme , which has led to economically crippling sanctions .
Iranians also hope that , after Ahmadinejad 's years of bombastic rhetoric and Holocaust denial , the international community will respond positively to the Rouhani administration 's moderated tone . ""
After years of [ being ] classless people who could n't even show the world the real face of Iranians , we have someone professional who can get international respect and at the same time work for the benefit of the country , "" said Afshin , 30 .
While hopeful for detente , he added the situation was not yet ripe for the US and Iranian leaders to meet face to face . ""
[ Barack ] Obama and Rouhani can not meet outright .
After all , here we call America the great devil , a hegemony that takes what it wants .
Both governments have to maintain face .
Let 's not forget that we still have very religious radical forces here that will never agree to great concessions to America . ""
However , observers also noted that sanctions have taken their toll on the regime 's resolve , bringing even Iran 's most conservative forces to the negotiating table .
"" The sanctions are breaking everyone 's knees , "" said Afshin .
"" When factories close and the price of bread skyrockets , there is no room for ideology â€ “ there must be an agreement . ""
In the lower - income neighbourhood of Nazi Abad in south Tehran , Ali , a 45-year - old maintenance worker , complained about the doubling price of building materials , saying that "" nothing has changed "" .
Ali is from a nearby village but is living in Tehran , temporarily , he hopes .
He has brought his youngest daughter with him from their village and she lives with him on the 24-hour building site where he works .
"" Nothing 's really changed in the past two months .
They say the price of gold has gone down , but what is that to us ?
I work in agriculture .
I would just ask Rouhani not to terminate the loans Ahmadinejad made to farmers .
He provided agriculture and home loans that were really beneficial .
"" They have n't put an end to the loans yet â€ “ and I do n't think they will any time soon .
But I 'm afraid they will eventually because of their animosity toward Ahmadinejad .
"" I think we need to wait six or seven months and see what happens .
They say if they lift sanctions , things will get better .
Rouhani is close to [ former president Akbar Hashemi ]
Rafsanjani and he will tell him what he needs to do .
Rouhani himself is someone the world can respect .
But for now , nothing has changed .
Cement still costs the same as it did . ""
Majid , 40 , owns a car repair shop in Yazd .
He and his wife and two children have travelled to the capital to visit a sick relative .
He 's smoking while waiting for a ride from their host . ""
Rouhani is good , very good , "" he says .
In politics or economics ? ""
Both .
During that so - and - so Ahmadinjad 's government , we were moving in a negative direction .
We 're below zero right now , but at least we 're working our way to zero .
I think we need to give Rouhani a year or two .
It 'll take a long time to get out from under the disaster that idiot brought upon us .
"" I hope Rouhani can revive the bazaar .
I do n't want too much .
I just hope he can repair our society .
Our society is in ruins . ""
Hamid , a 44-year - old advertising executive , was full of praise for Rouhani .
"" We are still having a ball with [ Rouhani in office ] .
Rouhani motchakerim
( we thank you , Rouhani ) .
During Ahmadinejad 's time I had lost all hope .
Now I am much more hopeful â€ “
but there is always reason to be doubtful .
Let 's see what Ahmad Jannati [ hardline cleric ] and General Yahya Rahim Safavi [ of the Revolutionary Guards ] , who will give speeches during Friday prayers , say tomorrow . ""
His friend Mehry , who works in the health industry , appealed to the international media not to exaggerate the situation .
"" I believe that if the western media does not start their crazy sensationalism and sticks to real news rather than overanalysing every single word that every single authority says in Iran , there is a lot of hope .
But when international media keeps on bombarding the airways with issues like ' the leader is now scared ' , or ' the Islamic republic is admitting their defeat ' and similar analysis , it only emboldens the hardliners ( in all camps ) , then this hope will not last long and we will be spiralling back into animosity . ""
Art student Nima , 18 , is more skeptical .
"" I will not say anything until things really change .
I do not want false hopes .
I will comment after I see with my eyes that Obama shakes hands with Rohani and we do not see military actions on any tables anywhere . ""
â€¢ Names have been changed ."
2013-09-19,"Iran 's new president Hassan Rouhani has told an American television audience he is hopeful of a diplomatic breakthrough over Tehran 's nuclear weapons programme , insisting his country had no intention of developing weapons of mass destruction .
Speaking before a crucial visit to the United Nations in New York , Rouhani claimed his government had "" full power and authority "" from Iran 's supreme leader to negotiate over the nuclear programme , which the US fears is close to creating a bomb . ""
The problem wo n't be from our side , "" said Rouhani in his first interview with western journalists since coming to power .
"" We have sufficient political latitude to solve this problem . ""
"" Under no circumstances would we seek any weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear weapons , nor will we ever , "" he added in initial clips of the interview with NBC aired on Wednesday night "" We have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb and we are not going to do so .
We are solely seeking peaceful nuclear technology . ""
Though Iran has long insisted it has only peaceful intentions for its nuclear programme , the reassurances of Rouhani on US television before his trip to New York will help foster hopes in the administration that more moderate political forces are prevailing in Tehran .
President Obama and Rouhani recently exchanged letters following Iranian elections and the two may meet on the sidelines of the UN general assembly next week .
Rouhani even appeared to pay tribute to Obama 's handling of the Syria crisis , saying it was not a sign of weakness to seek diplomatic rather than military solutions in such cases .
"" We consider war a weakness and any government that decides on peace we look on with respect , "" the Iranian president said .
He declined to comment on Iran 's role in the deal over Syrian chemical weapons recently brokered by Moscow , but added : "" We are one of the countries in the region that seeks peace and stability and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction . ""
Earlier , White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama welcomed the recent positive noises from Tehran .
"" I think it 's fair to say that the president believes there is an opportunity for diplomacy when it comes to the issues that have presented challenges to the United States and our allies with regards to Iran , "" he said .
"" And we hope that the Iranian government takes advantage of this opportunity . ""
But Carney said the US will test Rouhani 's assertions that he wants to improve relations with the international community .
In his letter , Obama indicated that the US was ready to resolve the nuclear issue in a way that would allow Iran to demonstrate that its program was exclusively for peaceful purposes , Carney said .
Rouhani said of the note he got from the White House congratulating him on his June election : "" From my point of view , the tone of was positive and constructive . ""
"" It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future .
I believe the leaders in all countries could think in their national interest and they should not be under the influence of pressure groups .
I hope to witness such an atmosphere in the future . """
2013-09-19,"The sole Jewish member of the Iranian parliament will accompany President Hassan Rouhani when he travels to New York next week for the UN general assembly .
Siamak Moreh Sedgh , who represents Iran 's Jewish community in the majlis , the country 's parliament , will try to help Rouhani revamp the Islamic republic 's image on the world stage after eight acrimonious years under previous president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who issued controversial statements about the Holocaust .
The move comes after Rouhani pledged to work to improve civil rights for Iranian minorities and provide a bigger role for them in government when he was sworn in to office in August .
Sedgh and Ahmad - Reza Dastgheyb , a Muslim , are the only MPs travelling with Rouhani to the UN , local agencies reported .
After the constitutional revolution , which took place between 1905 to 1907 , Iranian Jews were given a reserved seat in the parliament which they have retained after the 1979 Islamic revolution .
After Ahmadinejad 's departure from power , Rouhani appears to have started an initiative to tell the world that Iran , whose official religion is Islam , is not against Jews .
Rouhani 's Twitter account , believed to be run through his office , surprised many recently by posting a Rosh Hashanah blessing for the Jewish new year .
Iran 's foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , followed in Rouhani 's footsteps by tweeting a similar blessing .
"" Our Jewish countrymen are a recognised minority in Iran and have an active representative in the parliament , "" Zarif told the semi - official Tasnim news agency after his tweet in early September , according to Tehran Times .
"" We were never against Jews .
We oppose Zionists who are a small group , "" he said .
"" We do not allow the Zionists to represent Iran as an anti - Semitic country in their propaganda so they can cover up their crimes against Palestinian and Lebanese people .
"" Iran is believed to have the largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel .
The country 's Jewish population declined after the Islamic revolution as many of its members emigrated to Israel or other countries around the world .
Only officially - recognised religious minorities are represented in the Iranian parliament .
Like Jews , Zoroastrians also have a reserved seat but Christians have three , mainly because of their bigger population .
The Baha'i faith , which was founded in Iran , is banned and its members are the most persecuted religious minorities in the country , with no access to higher education .
Sedgh succeeded a famous Jewish Iranian MP , Mauric Motamed , in 2008 and has since been able to retain his seat .
Sedgh 's visa for the US has not yet been issued .
Zarif 's tweet attracted a great deal of attention .
He also responded to a tweet by Christine Pelosi , the daughter of the US politician Nancy Pelosi , who had told the Iranian minister that the Jewish new year "" would have been sweeter "" if Iran ended its Holocaust denial .
Zarif posted to her : "" Iran never denied it .
The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone .
Happy New Year . ""
The Iranian foreign minister was referring to Ahmadinejad ."
2013-09-19,"The White House has hinted at the possibility of a historic meeting with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani during his visit to the United Nations next week , praising what it called "" welcome rhetoric "" from Iran on nuclear weapons .
In the latest sign of a thaw in relations between the two countries , White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged "" dramatic "" shifts in Tehran 's language but stressed the need to see it matched by actions .
On Wednesday Rouhani gave an interview to NBC insisting the country had no intention of putting its civilian nuclear programme to military ends and suggested he had political authority inside Iran to negotiate a solution to a standoff with the west over the programme .
Earlier , the reform - minded president also agreed to release a series of political prisoners , raising hopes in Washington that he was gaining traction over more hardline elements in Tehran .
The two developments produced a positive response from the White House on Thursday , but administration officials remain cautious about the extent to which he can act independently of Iran 's surpreme leader Ali Khamenei .
"" We obviously notice a significant change in language and tone , it 's rather dramatic , but it 's important we do n't just take Iran 's word for it , "" said Carney .
"" The release of political prisoners is a welcome action .
The welcome rhetoric over nuclear weapons is just that .
Words are not a substitute for action and we need to see follow - through . ""
Both Obama and Rouhani will be in New York at the same time next week for the United Nations general assembly and hopes are rising that the two may meet to discuss what progress on nuclear weapons would be required for the US to lift its crippling sanctions regime against Iran .
Carney again hinted this was possible , but insisted the US had always been willing to talk to Iran about ending the alleged nuclear weapons programme .
Asked if the two leaders would meet in New York , he replied : "" We will see .
It has always been possible . ""
He added : "" The president has said all along that he would be willing to have that meeting providing that Iran demonstrates its seriousness in dealing with its nuclear weapons programme . ""
Next week 's UN meeting is shaping up to be a crucial test of American foreign policy in the region , with the security council also due to discuss action over Syria 's chemical weapons programme .
On Thursday , secretary of state John Kerry made an impassioned plea for the UN to stop debating whether Syria had used chemical weapons and move on to what to do about it .
In a sign that last week 's deal in Geneva for Syria to hand over its weapons may not have been enough to overcome diplomatic opposition from Moscow , Kerry gave an unexpected press conference to press home the significance of the UN report on chemical weapons use in Damascus . ""
This fight about Syria 's chemical weapons is not a game .
It 's real .
It 's important , "" said Kerry . ""
Please .
This is n't complicated .
The security council must be prepared to act next week .
Time is short .
Let 's not spend time debating what we already know , "" he added .
"" We need to make the Geneva agreement meaningful . """
2013-09-19,"There are today more than enough signs to indicate that Iran wants to use its newly elected president , Hassan Rouhani , to break the stalemate over its nuclear programme and release the grip that sanctions are having on its economy .
The recent exchange of letters between the two presidents ; the decision to transfer the nuclear file from the Supreme National Security Council to the foreign ministry under the guidance of the respected diplomat Mohammad Javad Zarif – both point in the same direction .
At home , too , Mr Rouhani appears to be true to his word , releasing Iran 's most prominent human rights activist , Nasrin Sotoudeh , and easing the conditions of house arrest of the two leaders of the 2009 opposition movement , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi .
Mr Rouhani 's licence to negotiate has , of course , to be scrutinised .
One always has to be clear which factions in Iran are waving the olive branch .
Mr Rouhani has prepared his trip next week to the UN by speaking first and foremost to the Revolutionary Guards .
He told that bastion of conservatism to stay out of politics , although he was careful to soften the message by doffing the cap to their economic clout .
The point was reinforced by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the next day .
There were signs of a pushback :
Fars News , which is close to the Revolutionary Guards , reported only the positive part of Mr Rouhani 's message .
It could also be said that the power vested in Mr Rouhani personally may yet turn out to be a poisoned chalice if the negotiations on Iran 's uranium enrichment hit a brick wall .
But for now , the leadership of the guards , which scuttled the initiatives of Iran 's previous reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , has been told to stay quiet .
The initiative is not new .
The supreme leader had already given his blessing for direct talks with the US before Mr Rouhani 's election .
The difference now is that pragmatists in Iran have a man to represent them , and he appears to enjoy political cover .
Nor is there much secrecy about the sort of deal that could be struck , or at least its broad parameters .
Iran agrees to enrich uranium to a maximum of 5 % ; it ships out the more dangerous material enriched to 20 % ( a short step away from bomb - grade levels ) ; and rejoins the additional protocol which it left in 2005 , granting inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency unannounced access .
In return , Iran 's right to enrich for civilian purposes is acknowledged and the sanctions start to be lifted .
The path to a deal like this is pitted with elephant traps .
Establishing mutual trust and credibility will not be easy after an impasse that has lasted for 11 years .
Some sanctions , such as the disconnection of Iran 's banks from the Swift payment system , are easier to lift than others .
The US Congress remains hawkish and convinced that it alone brought Iran to the table again .
Why take the foot off Iran 's throat , just as the pressure appears to be working , so the argument goes ?
President Barack Obama could use his presidential waiver on Congress - mandated sanctions , but Iran would have to be convinced first that his successor would not reimpose them .
For Iran to make significant concessions , it needs to be given a clear road map .
Its reinclusion into the global trading system , while remaining conditional on progress , must not be made so distant as to be unachievable .
Mr Rouhani has been on this merry - go - round before .
In 2003 he took Iran into two years of negotiations during which Tehran suspended uranium enrichment before talks broke down .
Today , Iran 's nuclear enrichment programme is more advanced .
It can regain lost ground faster .
It has kept its medium - enriched uranium below the quantities needed to make a bomb , announcing recently a 42 % cut in this stock .
By the same token , its ability to regenerate those stocks is greater .
The opportunity to take relations with Iran out of this death spiral patently exists .
It should be seized by Mr Obama , even though he may not have the political capital needed to push this through .
But the stakes are too high to do anything else ."
2013-09-20,"The White House has left the door open to a personal encounter between Barack Obama and Iran 's new reform - minded president , Hassan Rouhani , at the UN general assembly next week , amid signs that western powers plan to seize on recent diplomatic overtures from Tehran .
The US president is not scheduled to formally meet with Rouhani , who has been on a charm offensive since he took up post last month , promising to end the standoff over Iran 's nuclear program and provide the country with much needed relief from economic sanctions .
But there has been growing speculation over a potential encounter between the two leaders on the margins of Tuesday 's meeting at UN headquarters in New York , which would be a carefully choreographed but potent sign of improving relations between the two countries .
"" The fact of the matter is we do n't have a meeting scheduled with President Rouhani , but we 're always open to diplomacy if we believe it can advance our objectives , and in this instance our objective is an Iran that meets its international obligations , "" said Ben Rhodes , a deputy national security adviser at the White House .
Rhodes said Obama had indicated since 2007 that he was willing to have bilateral meetings with Iran without preconditions if there is was an opportunity for progress .
Rhodes also said other western powers would be closely involved in any talks . ""
The issues between the United States and Iran are not ones that would be settled with one discussion , "" he added .
Western diplomats believe the new Iranian administration is playing a high - risk strategy that could face resistance from hardline elements in Tehran opposed to nuclear talks , particularly if Rouhani returns from New York with nothing to show in terms of progress .
But they perceive a rare window of opportunity – and one that will not be open indefinitely .
One diplomatic source said the newly - empowered pragmatist wing in Iran had displayed "" some pretty fancy footwork "" in recent weeks in preparing the groundwork for the UN meeting , but Rouhani 's delegation needed to convince western powers that it was serious about giving ground on nuclear enrichment , in return for an easing of sanctions .
Obama will give a welcome address at the UN on Tuesday , a few hours before Rouhani is scheduled to address the assembly , a symbolically important though coincidental confluence of scheduling that will highlight building hopes of a breakthrough in relations between the two powers .
Asked on Thursday if the two leaders would meet , a White House spokesman replied : "" We will see .
It has always been possible .
"" Obama plans to meet formally with his counterparts from Nigeria and Lebanon in New York , and has also scheduled a meeting with the president of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas .
The meeting will occur just days before Obama hosts the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , at the White House .
Obama 's address will , according to Rhodes , focus on recent events in the north Africa and Middle East , touching on the final status negotiations between Israel and Palestine .
He said it will also include a section on Iran 's nuclear programme and US "" openness to diplomacy and the prospect for a peaceful resolution "" .
Rhodes told a conference call with reporters that the US administration still believed there was time for a diplomatic solution to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon , despite suggestions from Israel that time had run out for any negotiated solution .
Israel dismissed Rouhani 's attempts at dialogue on Friday , saying the Iranian leader was engaged in "" media spin "" .
Yuval Steinitz , Israel 's minister for strategic affairs , said the Iranians were six months away from developing a bomb , and that "" there is no more time to hold negotiations "" .
Signs of a changing attitude under Iran 's new leader have been coming thick and fast .
On Friday , Rouhani called for "" constructive interaction with the world "" in an opinion article published by the Washington Post .
In language that contrasted starkly with that of his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , he wrote : "" Gone is the age of blood feuds …
A constructive approach to diplomacy … means engaging with one 's counterparts . ""
Rouhani went on to say that the old "" Cold War mentality leads to everyone 's losses "" , and expressed a desire to move "" beyond impasses , whether in relation to Syria , my country 's nuclear program or its relations with the United States "" .
The recent , more conciliatory tone from Tehran is being seen in Washington as the best hope of an end to the hostile stand - off with the Islamic Republic which has existed since Obama came to office in 2009 , when he promised to try to put the two country 's relations on a new footing .
Were Obama and Rouhani to meet in New York next week , it would be the first face - to - face interaction between the countries ' presidents since the Iranian revolution of 1979 .
The driving force for the apparent glasnost in approach in Tehran appears to be the ongoing international sanctions that are extracting a heavy price on the Iranian economy .
Geneive Abdo , a former Guardian Tehran correspondent who is now an Iran expert at the non - partisan think tank the Stimson Center , said the sanctions "" have never been this deep or broad .
Oil exports are plummeting and Iran can no longer participate in the international banking system , which prevents it selling goods for hard currency "" .
Abdo said there are indications the regime fears that prolonged economic hardship could instigate another round of popular protests such as the "" green "" unrest of 2009 , which was harshly crushed .
Judging from past experience , the key to whether Rouhani can effect real change will be the support , or lack of it , of the true power in the land , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei .
There too , signs are so far promising .
On Tuesday Khamenei used the expression "" heroic leniency "" , which is being interpreted as a euphemism for a softer stance on foreign policy .
The following day , 11 political prisoners were freed from jail .
Apart from Rouhani 's appearance at the UN on Tuesday , he will be speaking in New York at an event co - hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Society on Thursday .
He will also make appearances on CNN and on Charlie Rose 's interview show on PBS .
Obama has promised to test the new apparent openness to dialogue in Tehran .
But administration officials are at the same time making clear that there will be no lifting of sanctions without real movement from the Iranian regime .
In particular , Iran will have to accept stringent controls on its disputed nuclear programme , which the US and its allies see as a path to acquiring nuclear weapons .
Negotiations on nuclear enrichment may prove to be the most difficult shift to get past Iran 's hardliners and Rouhani is treading carefully : in his Washington Post article , he repeated the conventional argument that for Iran , developing a "" peaceful nuclear energy program "" is "" about who Iranians are as a nation "" ."
2013-09-20,"Iran 's new reform - minded president , Hassan Rouhani , may meet Barack Obama in an informal , orchestrated encounter at the UN general assembly next week , amid signs of a rapidly softening stance in Tehran .
Rouhani will address the assembly on Tuesday afternoon , a few hours after the traditional opening speech by the host president , Barack Obama – a symbolically important though coincidental confluence of scheduling that will highlight building hopes of a breakthrough in relations between the two powers .
Observers will be watching to see whether the two leaders meet physically within the UN building in mid - town Manhattan , though the latest indication is that they might have a ceremonial greeting rather than a formal engagement .

Negotiations on nuclear enrichment may prove to be the most difficult shift to get past Iran 's hardliners and Rouhani is treading carefully : in his Washington Post article , he repeated the conventional argument that for Iran , developing a "" peaceful nuclear energy program "" is "" about who Iranians are as a nation "" ."
2013-09-21,"Today , the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , elected three months ago on a platform of "" prudence and hope "" , arrives in New York to address the UN General Assembly on Tuesday , a few hours after the traditional opening speech by the host , President Obama . ""
Go and wake up your luck "" is a traditional Persian proverb .
In the latest of a series of surprise moves , on Friday Rouhani woke up the international community with an article in the Washington Post that hinted at a possible end to the nuclear standoff that has acted as a tinderbox in the Middle East for years . ""
A zero sum cold war mentality leads to everyone 's loss , "" Rouhani wrote .
His goal , he explained , was "" constructive engagement "" .
Over the coming days , Obama and Rouhani will engage in a delicate dance of diplomacy – perhaps even meeting face to face to demonstrate signs of an accord – not least so that the latter can return home with the beginning of an American - Iranian entente that even diehard Middle East pessimists say has the promise of something historic , a milestone for the region .
In the 34-year history of the Islamic Republic of Iran , the pace of change since Rouhani 's unexpected victory in the summer has been unprecedented .
In his first news conference , the centrist Shia cleric promised that "" if the United States shows good will and mutual respect , the way for interaction will be open "" .
Last week , as further proof of his intent , 11 prominent political prisoners were freed , including human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh .
More releases are rumoured .
Friendly letters have been exchanged between Obama and Rouhani .
Rouhani recently tweeted new year 's greetings to Jews celebrating Rosh Hashanah and he arrives in New York today accompanied by Siamak Moreh Sedgh , the sole Jewish member of the majlis , the Iranian parliament .
In a recent television interview with an American channel , another first , Mr Rouhani said that Iran would never "" seek weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear weapons "" and that he had "" full power and complete authority "" to strike a nuclear deal .
Ultimate power lies with the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Observers say his support for this new diplomatic offensive is apparent in the transfer of authority over the nuclear issue from the hawkish national security council to the foreign ministry , now led by Mohammad Javad Zarif .
American educated , he spent five years until 2007 as Iran 's ambassador at the United Nations .
Zarif is said to welcome the signs that "" the drums of war in the region "" are going silent .
Tomorrow , he is due to meet William Hague , the foreign secretary , and the EU foreign policy chief , Lady Ashton , who has been a party to the nuclear talks .
In spite of these positive manoeuvres , the memory of the bloody reprisals exacted on the Iranian opposition , the green movement , following the surge for change in 2009 , is still fresh .
And so are the images of Mr Rouhani 's predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , at the UN General Assembly , denouncing "" uncivilised Zionists "" , suggesting the Holocaust was a myth and accusing the US of an "" international policy of bullying "" .
Still , Obama has his best chance yet to make good his 2008 campaign promise to explore the possibility of improved relations and a nuclear rapprochement with Iran .
The three key questions at this juncture are : why is Iran making overtures now ?
Has
Rouhani the time and the clout to keep his country 's hardliners in check in the face of Israel 's insistence that the "" mad mullahs "" still rule and Iran 's nuclear programme continues to advance ?
And what might a rapprochement , however fragile , look like ?
Why now is a question in part answered by the state of the Iranian economy since sanctions were tightened still further last year .
Financial restrictions prevent Iran selling goods for hard currency .
According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies , oil revenue has dropped by 45 % , costing the economy about $ 150 m a day in lost earnings ; industrial production has fallen by 40 % ; unemployment has risen by a third and consumer prices have shot up by 87 % .
All of which adds up to major public discontent .
Recent events in Syria have also added leverage .
Iran has strenuously backed Assad .
As a result , a poll in March revealed that Iran was viewed unfavourably in 14 out of 20 Arab and Muslim countries .
Russia 's proactive involvement now may open up a resolution to the Syrian debacle .
Rouhani has a short - term tactical advantage in that Iranian hardliners have been left in disarray since his shock election .
However , any sign of an American reprimand , rejection or humiliation and , domestically , Rouhani will be wounded ; second chances are rare .
So what shape might negotiations take ?
On Wednesday , the Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , addresses the UN General Assembly .
If the US keeps him in line , optimism may grow .
For months , however , "" Bibi "" has been repeating his demand of a four - step formula .
Iran must stop enriching uranium ; remove enriched uranium from the country ; close its nuclear plant near Qom ; and stop "" the plutonium track "" , the path to nuclear weapons .
For his part , Mr Rouhani has asserted his country 's right to have a peaceful nuclear energy programme , including the right to enrich uranium for fuel .
The contours of a potential nuclear deal are visible , says IISS analyst Dina Esfandiary .
It includes greater transparency , ensured by international inspections ( inspections that Israel continues to refuse ) .
Der Spiegel has reported that Rouhani is also prepared to shut down the Fordow nuclear - enrichment plant in return for a relaxation of sanctions .
Rouhani is an establishment man , not a radical .
A protege of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president
, he has been an influential fixer since the revolution , becoming a former head of the national security council , central to Iran 's foreign and nuclear policy .
Educated in part at Glasgow 's Caledonian University , he appears to be interpreting Khamenei 's instructions on "" heroic leniency "" as a call to pragmatism at an opportune time .
Now aged 64 , Rouhani is also propelled by another powerful force for change – a young population well connected digitally to the outside world despite the regime 's best efforts .
It was the young who voted him in as a representative of the opposition . ""
A strong government , ""
Mr Rouhani has observed , heeding the import of that endorsement , "" is not a government that limits the lives of people .
"" It is early days .
Iran remains an Islamic theocracy with a tight hold on its citizens .
However , Mr Rouhani has exercised considerable courage and conciliation .
Obama must respond with tact , sound offers and good faith .
The impact for Iran , not so long ago seen as a continual threat to world peace , and for the rest of the Middle East , could be momentous .
For now is a time for hope ."
2013-09-21,"Iranian hardliners appear to have given their tacit support to president Hassan Rouhani as the moderate cleric prepares to travel to New York on what could be a critically important visit to the United Nations , which may include a historic meeting with his American counterpart .
Hawkish fundamentalists , including the elite Revolutionary Guards close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , have refrained from demonstrating opposition to Rouhani 's new bid to pursue "" constructive engagement "" with the international community .
This could include talks over Iran 's controversial nuclear programme and the Syrian conflict .
The Iranian president is keen to show the world that he has a united country behind him .
Khamenei , long a fierce critic of the US , has thrown his weight behind Rouhani , apparently giving his blessing for direct talks between Rouhani and President Barack Obama , which could take place on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly this week .
And Iran 's opposition activists and politicians , given new heart after Rouhani 's victory in June , appear to share support for the new president in his attempt to improve relations with the west .
Saturday 's headlines in Tehran reflected the mood of growing optimism in Iran , where even the hardline press such as Keyhan , an ultra - conservative newspaper whose director is directly appointed by Khamenei , appears to be welcoming the possibility of a historic meeting that can put an end to Tehran and Washington 's three decades of animosity .
"" I have no plans , but it 's possible , "" was Keyhan 's headline , quoting Rouhani on the possibility of a meeting with Obama .
In a further sign that Rouhani has full authority , the Revolutionary Guard issued a statement offering support for his administration .
Mohammad Ali Abtahi , the former vice - president of Iran under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami , told the Observer that he saw Rouhani 's trip as "" the most important visit "" to the UN by an Iranian president in "" the most exceptional circumstances "" . ""
On one hand , Rouhani has the support of the supreme leader , on the other , the US has to come to terms with its mistakes in dealing with Iran in the past , "" he said .
By mentioning mistakes , Abtahi was referring particularly to the time , under Khatami , when President George Bush labelled Iran as part of "" an axis of evil "" along with North Korea and Iraq , despite Khatami 's reformist administration .
Rouhani 's visit contrasts with those made by his predecessors , Abtahi said , because "" conservatives are not sabotaging and not expressing opposing views "" .
Zahra Eshraghi , a reformist politician and a granddaughter of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of the 1979 Islamic revolution , echoed Abtahi , saying that conservatives have come to the realisation that Iran needs constructive relations with the international community . ""
Given our experience with sanctions recently , especially our difficulties with importing medicines , hardliners have also come to terms with the need for dialogue with the United States , "" she told the Observer . ""
The events in the region in the past two years [ a reference to Syria ] shows that Iran remains as a regional power and the US , too , needs to have dialogue with Iran "" she added .
"" The time has come for the two countries to put aside the mutual distrust and act on their national interests . ""
On Monday morning in New York , the stage management and hype gives way to bargaining , as Mohammad Javad Zarif sits down for the first time as Iran 's foreign minister with Lady ( Catherine ) Ashton , the EU 's foreign policy chief to gauge how far Iran has really come in from the cold .
Zarif is to meet William Hague , the British foreign secretary , as well , and may have a staged brief encounter with the US secretary of state , John Kerry , in some UN corridor during the week - long general assembly .
Whatever happens , the atmosphere will almost certainly be an improvement on what has gone before .
Zarif 's predecessor as Iran 's delegate , Saeed Jalili , was a dry bureaucrat inclined to read out convoluted didacticpresentations , apparently scared to stray from the script written in Tehran .
Any hint of ambiguity or spontaneity sprouted long delays while he phoned for instructions .
Zarif could not be more different ; he is a skilled diplomat and is fluent in English .
Moreover , everything that Zarif and Rouhani have said suggests that he , unlike Jalili , has full authority to negotiate , while Rouhani will paint the bigger picture at the general assembly of an Iranian republic trying to break free of its pariah status .
The question now is how these experienced diplomats play their hand .
At the lower end of expectations , the Iranians will spread bonhomie and make a date for serious nuclear negotiations in the coming weeks , involving the cumbersome format of the past few years that has kept the international community more or less on the same page , but with little real progress .
That format puts diplomats from six powers – US , UK , France , Germany , Russia and China – on one side of the negotiating table with Ashton , acting as their convenor .
Iran sits opposite them , wary and combative .
However , there is some reason to believe that the main players will aim for something more imaginative .
Rouhani and Obama are both in a hurry to score a success .
Rouhani is at the start of a honeymoon period in Tehran that will be measured in months , not years .
Obama , at the other end of his presidency , faces a slide into lame duck status .
Both men know , as do all the other players in this tortuous game , that if there is to be a deal it will ultimately be hammered out between Washington and Tehran with the other five nations acting as facilitators .
If they sense an opening , they could cut out the middle men – and woman – and head straight to bilateral talks .
If that is in the air , expect to see an historic handshake this week – which would be the first between a US president and a leader from the Islamic Republic of Iran .
However , there will be bumps along the way .
Informal bilateral contacts could proceed in tandem with the multilateral negotiations , if only to keep Russia and China engaged .
Or the multilateral track might give way at some point to a bilateral endgame .
Whichever route is taken , it is a negotiation in which everyone at the table has a fairly clear and widely shared vision , of the outcome : an Iran empowered to continue its nuclear programme but under internationally dictated limits .
The country would be allowed to enrich uranium without the burden of sanctions , but only up to a maximum of 5 % purity – enough to make reactor fuel , not weapons .
The world 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , would have a stronger inspection mandate , allowing it to examine not just the facilities Iran declares it has but also sites it suspects could be harbouring secret weapons work .
Iran would also have to give up its stock of 20 % uranium , currently the main proliferation concern because of the ease with which it could be further spun into weapons - grade fissile material .
There could also be some understanding on what happens at Arak , where a heavy water reactor is under construction that could produce plutonium , another possible fuel for a bomb .
But that might be left for another day .
Slow progress at the site has meant it will not be opening early next year as planned , giving the negotiators some breathing space .
Even if the parties to the talks have a shared sense of where they are going , getting there will be complicated .
Rouhani will want sanctions relief up front so that he can return to Tehran in triumph and widen his own political window of opportunity .
If not , the loose leash that Khamenei has allowed the president could be yanked back .
Khamenei is making the right noises , but there is still no certainty he has made the strategic decision to bottle up the nuclear programme ."
2013-09-21,"On the eve of President Hassan Rouhani and foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif 's departure this week for the annual UN General Assembly meeting in New York , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to embrace the prospect of a rapprochement with Iran 's western adversaries .
Speaking at a gathering of members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , the Islamic republic 's supreme leader declared , "" We are not against proper and rational diplomatic moves , be it in the diplomatic sphere , or the sphere of domestic politics . ""
He added , employing a phrase that was widely discussed in the Iranian media and social networks , "" Your servant believes in what was coined years ago : ' heroic flexibility . '
Flexibility is necessary on certain occasions .
It is very beneficial .
"" This is hardly the first time that Khamenei has introduced a coded phrase into a major pronouncement , and as usual the principlist media outlets raced to interpret it .
In this case , the apparent winner was Mohammad Reza Asadzadeh , a writer for Khabar Online , who noted that in 1969 , a 30-year - old Khamenei translated into Farsi an Arabic text , Hassan 's Peace , in which author Razi el - Yassin discusses the armistice agreed to by Hassan ibn Ali , the second Shia Imam .
Asadzadeh pointed out that the young cleric had given the work a new ( rather bluntly didactic ) subtitle : "" History 's Most Glorious Exercise of Flexibility . ""
The eldest son of Ali , the first Shia Imam , Hassan claimed the right to the caliphate after his father 's assassination in 661 and declared war against the then caliph , Muawiyah .
Realising that he would not be able to defeat the caliph militarily , he accepted a peace accord .
Subsequently , according to Shia narratives , Hassan 's younger brother , Hossein , backed only by a small group of fighters engaged Muawiyah 's son in a battle in which he and his entire family were decimated . ""
See , in this regime , anytime they want to talk of standing in the face of tyranny , they point to Imam Hossein , and whenever they are seeking moderation and consensus , they recall Imam Hassan .
Two distinctly different models , "" said a religious scholar who follows Iranian politics .
"" The pronouncement by Agha [ "" sir , "" a common epithet for the supreme leader ] suggest that until further notice , we are henceforth following the Hassan model .
That is : Hello diplomacy , so long martyrdom . ""
A senior political journalist observed that Khamenei had also used the phrase 17 years ago , during President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani 's second term , in a meeting with foreign ministry officials .
The supreme leader was quoted as saying , "" Iran 's political envoys to the world must be sharper than a sword , softer than gossamer , and tougher than stone and annealed steel .
Foreign political affairs is an arena for heroic flexibility , but a flexibility which is cutting to the enemy . ""
He delivered the speech during a period when relations between the Islamic republic and the EU had been strained to the breaking point by a string of state - sponsored assassinations of Iranian opposition figures around Europe , including the killing of former prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar in 1991 and the infamous Mykonos affair the following year .
A Green Movement activist who served time in prison after the 2009 protests remarked on an adjoining passage in this week 's speech in which the ayatollah said , "" The diplomatic sphere is a realm of smiles .
They smile , and also negotiate . ""
Smiling himself , the activist commented , "" Seven months ago , his eminence was a revolutionary .
Suddenly he has turned diplomat . ""
He was recalling a previous speech the supreme leader had made to a gathering of Revolutionary Guards in which he had separated himself from those advocating negotiation with the United States .
"" I am not a man of diplomacy , "" Khamenei stated then .
"" I am a revolutionary and that is why I speak brazenly , honestly , and decisively . ""
The activist continued , "" It is of greatest importance that he gave his speech [ this week ] at a gathering of military leaders .
They had seen themselves as the masters of Iran 's nuclear programme and had readied themselves to pay any price for its advancement .
But now Mr. Khamenei has unexpectedly rediscovered his diplomatic soul .
"" I am not saying that they would be furious at Khamenei 's action â€ “ their relationship is of a mentor and disciples .
But ... certainly they must be demoralised a great deal . ""
The ayatollah 's recent statements have put Iran 's most vociferously right - wing media outlets in something of a bind .
The Kayhan daily , as always , has dedicated its front page to the supreme leader 's declarations , while carefully avoiding any reference to "" heroic flexibility . ""
One representative headline this week read , "" Global Changes Ca n't Be Excuses for Deviating from Revolution 's Principles . ""
Kayhan 's arch - conservative editor in chief , Hossein Shariatmadari , long regarded as one of Khamenei 's closest confidants in the media , has recently turned over editorial - writing responsibilities to an associate , Mohammad Imani .
The tension between endorsing the supreme leader 's apparent repositioning while maintaining a hardline on negotiations with the west is evident in Imani 's writing : "" As the much emulated sage of the revolution has explicated , while the path to diplomacy , negotiation , ingenuity , and tactical flexibility is not blocked , it is important to appreciate the key point that diplomacy is fundamentally an approach and a tool , and what gives it endurance is the strength of its inherent structure .
In other words , one ca n't expect diplomacy to be the bearer of the responsibility for struggle , resistance , domestic innovations , and the realisation of internal potentials , or god forbid , to approach the enemy from a demoted stance . ""
At the conservative Resalat daily , meanwhile , political editor Salleh Eskandari chose to define the criteria for "" heroic flexibility "" as the condemnation of atrocities by "" American and Zionist occupiers . ""
He also warned Rouhani 's newly appointed negotiating team not to follow the path taken a decade ago by the administration of the reformist Mohammad Khatami : "" No flexibility is heroic without pursuit of justice and confrontation of abuse , and no level of tolerance will achieve any goals as we travelled that road during the reformist period and did n't meet with any results . ""
Mashregh News , the hardliners ' hardline website , took aim at several reformist dailies for their choice of headlines regarding the supreme leader 's speech â€ “ Bahar , Aftab , and Shargh each ran the headline "" We Trust in Heroic Flexibility in Diplomacy , "" while Etemaad went with "" Tactical Application of Heroic Flexibility . ""
According to a Mashregh editorial , such characterisations of Khamenei 's statement are "" wrong and inappropriate .
Of course the peace accord by Imam Hassan , all God 's blessings be upon him , was and remains a justified and acceptable event ; it was a responsibility which the irreproachable Imam had to fulfill and not a speck of fault sticks to it .
Whereas the point is that our nation 's issue today is not the same issue as Imam Hassan 's armistice . ...
It is not possible to accept the erroneous takes by some political factions and imagine that Muslim Iran has fallen weak and feeble , that it has been stricken by doubts about its future , or it is prepared to back away from its goals . ""
A political affairs journalist at one of the leading reformist dailies , who requested anonymity both for himself and his paper , said , "" It is quite obvious that the right - wing media is in shock .
It is true that Mr. Khamenei says lots of contradictory things lots of times , but his speech ... was very transparent : just hours prior to the departure of Rouhani and Zarif for New York he suddenly says , ' Exercise flexibility . '
"" Of course , the right - wingers are really shameless .
They still ca n't accept the reality that Khamenei respects Rouhani 's policies and has trust in him .
They continue to try to portray that Agha did n't mean that but rather this .
That 's to be expected .
According to the journalist , Iran 's right - wing media have long "" used any sort of excuse to support any wrangling with the west .
It was n't important to them that people were being sacrificed under the [ weight ] of the sanctions .
For eight years they wrote in that manner .
Now it is tough for them to face the new circumstances .
As they say , [ quitting a habit ] ' cold turkey makes you sick . '
""
A self - described socialist opposition activist argued that it is not certain that Khamenei has firmly decided to seek a quick reconciliation . ""
One again I 've been reminded what a grand leader [ Ayatollah Ruhollah ] Khomeini was , "" he said .
Referring to the decision by the Islamic republic 's first supreme leader to accept a UN - backed ceasefire after eight years of war with Iraq , the activist said of Khomeini , "" When he was convinced that continuing the ' battle , battle till victory ' policy was to the regime 's and the people 's detriment , he emptied the hemlock chalice in one gulp without trepidation or vacillation .
These days , they are taking small sips from that chalice .
They reflect and dither , but they keep on drinking . ""
Tehran Bureau 's Nuclear Watch series monitors the way the Iranian media reports the country 's nuclear programme"
2013-09-23,"The leader of Iran 's reformist movement , Mohammad Khatami , has urged the west to show courage and work with President Hassan Rouhani or risk losing an unprecedented opportunity to end the current standoff .
In an article published in the Guardian today , Khatami , a former president of Iran , said on the eve of Rouhani 's eagerly anticipated visit to the UN that the moderate cleric had "" the necessary authority "" for a diplomatic resolution to the longstanding differences between Tehran and the west , not least on the nuclear issue .
He warned that failure would strengthen extremists on both sides .
Speaking before leaving Tehran for New York , Rouhani pledged to revamp Iran 's image , which he said had been distorted .
But he fell short of blaming his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who delivered anti - western tirades each time he spoke at the UN .
Rouhani is scheduled to deliver his speech a few hours after Barack Obama 's welcoming statement on Tuesday , amid speculation that the first face - to - face encounter between leaders of the two countries since the 1970s will take place .
Rouhani will also be accompanied on his visit by Iran 's only Jewish MP .
The EU 's foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , who met Iran 's foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , on Monday in New York to talk about the country 's nuclear programme , described her discussions as constructive .
According to Ashton , Zarif and the US secretary of state , John Kerry , will meet on Thursday in what will become the first ministerial talks between Tehran and Washington since the Islamic revolution in 1979 .
Britain 's foreign secretary , William Hague , met Zarif for the first time on Monday night and discussed the nuclear issue and Syria .
They also talked about the prospect of gradually restoring full diplomatic relations between the UK and Iran , which were severely damaged when the British embassy in Tehran was over - run by a mob in November 2011 .
Hague made clear Britain required solid guarantees from Tehran that its diplomats could operate in safety .
"" We do n't want a confrontational relationship with Iran , "" Hague said after the meeting with Zarif .
"" We have discussed how to improve our bilateral relations but it will have to take place on a step - by - step basis .
I think we are agreed on this .
So we have asked our officials to some work on this .
Ultimately for Britain to be able to operate an embassy in Tehran again , we would have to know that the embassy could perform all the normal functions of an embassy without harassment and difficulties that it had to face before . ""
British officials said that no further meetings had been scheduled but that British and Iranian diplomats would be meeting in the coming weeks to discuss how to re - establish confidence in Tehran 's intentions .
Khatami , meanwhile , is throwing his weight behind Rouhani in the hope that lessons are learned from missed opportunities under his own presidency . ""
For the first time there is an opportunity to create a national consensus above and beyond partisan factionalism , which may address the political predicaments of the country with an emphasis on dialogue and mutual understanding globally , "" Khatami writes in his first article published in a foreign newspaper .
According to Khatami , Rouhani enjoys backing from all segments of Iranian society in his bid to pursue "" constructive engagement "" with the west , including from the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , who has shown some softening in his views about diplomacy recently .
In a further move to boost Rouhani 's credibility at the UN , Khamenei on Monday declared an amnesty for 80 political prisoners , including many arrested in the aftermath of the disputed 2009 election .
Khatami 's intervention comes as 500 prominent Iranian intellectuals and activists wrote to Obama , telling the American president that it is now his turn to reciprocate .
Signatories to the letter – also published exclusively by the Guardian – include the Oscar - winning film director Asghar Farhadi , the imprisoned reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh and the prominent intellectual Saeed Hajjarian . ""
The people of Iran seized the opportunity to elect Hassan Rouhani
… as a result , we have witnessed the release of several political prisoners and relative progress in the country 's public and political atmosphere , "" the letter says .
"" It is now your turn , and that of the international community , to reciprocate Iran 's measures of goodwill and pursue a win - win strategy that encompasses the lifting of the unjust economic sanctions on Iran . ""
At least 88 of the signatories are former or current political prisoners , some still serving lengthy prison terms .
Mohammadreza Jalaeipour , a former political prisoner who was behind the letter , said if Rouhani meets Obama , it will pave the way for a positive change in Iran 's internal political atmosphere .
He said : "" This letter … says with a loud voice that Rouhani has the support of reformists and those seeking for democracy in Iran . ""
Hajjarian , who was the target of an assassination attempt in March 2000 , echoed Jalaeipour , saying sanctions have hurt the quality of ordinary people 's lives in Iran . ""
The US has not yet realised the changes that have been taking place after people 's vote [ for Rouhani ] , "" he told the Guardian .
Under Khatami 's administration between 1997 and 2005 , Iran opened up towards the west , even helping American forces in Afghanistan , but was nevertheless labelled a part of the "" axis of evil "" , along with Iraq and North Korea , by George Bush .
Khatami 's support was crucial in Rouhani 's sensational victory in the June election .
In his article , the ex - president warns that diplomatic mistakes now will have consequences beyond Iran 's borders later .
"" Failure now to create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue will only further boost extremist forces on all sides .
The consequences of such a failure will not only be regional but global , "" Khatami writes . ""
For a better world , not only for the Iranian people but for the next generation across the globe , I earnestly hope that President Rouhani will receive a warm welcome and meaningful responses during his visit to the UN . ""
Sadeq Zibakalam , a Tehran University professor and one of the signatories of the letter , said different factions within the Iranian establishment , including fundamentalists , had come to the conclusion that Iran needed a rapprochement with the US : "" They have realised that without this , they ca n't bring changes to Iran 's current dire situation , especially its economy . ""
Zibakalam warned that if Rouhani fails to engage with the US , "" his position in Iran will be significantly weakened "" and he will have a hard time in the next four years .
Iran 's currency significantly recovered against the dollar on Monday , rising to its strongest value in several months .
Expectations of a Rouhani - Obama meeting come as a poll commissioned by the international civic organisation Avaaz , was released showing strong support both in the US and in Iran for an improvement in bilateral relations .
It showed that , of those who expressed an opinion , 74 % of Americans and 80 % of Iranians support direct talks ."
2013-09-23,"Faced with a stream of conciliatory rhetoric from Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , and a diplomatic overture to Tehran by Washington , Israeli officials are voicing scepticism and concern about a possible easing of western pressure on Iran to halt its nuclear programme .
The Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , says he will make Iran the focus of a meeting next week with the US president , Barack Obama , and a speech the next day at the UN general assembly , where he drew a red line on a cartoon bomb last year .
A statement from Netanyahu 's office described the newly elected president 's remarks about the peaceful aims of Iran 's nuclear programme and his readiness to pursue diplomacy as an exercise in media spin . ""
The true test is not Rouhani 's words , but rather the deeds of the Iranian regime , which continues to aggressively advance its nuclear programme while Rouhani is giving interviews , "" said the response , issued on Thursday after an interview the Iranian president granted to the American network NBC .
The statement raised the prospect of a reheating of old disagreements with the Obama administration over the handling of Iran , fuelled by an exchange of letters between Obama and Rouhani and talk in Washington of negotiations that could remove sanctions .
Reflecting the Israeli government 's concern that the US and Europe may be wavering , Netanyahu told a meeting of his cabinet last week that "" the pressure on Iran must be increased and not relaxed , and certainly not eased "" .
Netanyahu asserted that Iran must halt all uranium enrichment , remove enriched uranium from the country , dismantle the Fordo nuclear plant and stop "" the plutonium track "" to a nuclear weapon .
Dore Gold , president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a former adviser to Netanyahu , said : "" Right now Rouhani is in the midst of a charm offensive , and there are officials all across the west who feel compelled to respond with hopeful signals about Iranian intentions . ""
Israel is obviously focused on what actions Iran has taken .
The real question is what tangible change you see in Iranian behaviour .
We 're not talking about mood music . ""
Other analysts were similarly sceptical .
Rouhani "" is really focused on the economic hardship in Iran as a result of sanctions , and that 's why he wants to talk to the US and the international community , "" said Emily Landau , director of the arms control programme at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University .
"" He wants to get the sanctions off his back .
He has given absolutely no indication that Iran is willing to reverse course on the nuclear issue . ""
Israeli officials are concerned that in return for an easing of sanctions , Iran could give up part of its nuclear programme while maintaining components that will enable it to move quickly towards building a bomb when it sees fit .
Pointing to the recent confrontation with Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons , the officials argue that a credible military threat has to be maintained to press Iran to change course .
Even as he pursues diplomacy with Iran , Obama has said the military option remains on the table .
But Yuval Steinitz , Israel 's minister for strategic affairs , asserted in an interview published on Friday that such a promise was not enough .
Claiming that Iran was six months away from developing a bomb , Steinitz told the right - leaning newspaper Yisrael Hayom that time had run out for negotiations .
Zalman Shoval , a former ambassador to the US and a special envoy for Netanyahu , said that while "" officially there 's no space between us and the Americans , we 're more cautious , or perhaps more suspicious "" .
He added : "" With the economic situation in Iran approaching bankruptcy in many respects , if the pressure is working it should n't let up at this crucial point . """
2013-09-23,"As Hassan Rouhani , the president of the Islamic republic of Iran , prepares to deliver a speech on Tuesday to the UN general assembly , advocating "" constructive engagement "" with the world , I reflect on my own experience as president of this great country , and my attempts to promote dialogue among nations , instead of hostility .
At my suggestion , 2001 was named the UN Year of Dialogue Among Civilisations .
But despite reaching a global audience , the message of dialogue barely penetrated the most intractable political dilemmas , either at home or abroad .
More than at any other time in history , events in the Middle East and north Africa have taken on global significance , and there is a great shift in the importance of this region .
This transformation , which began with Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution â€ “ a surprise to many in the international community â€ “ intensified with the end of the cold war .
Today the Middle East has become a centre for new political , social and ideological forces as well as a site of collaboration and conflict with powers beyond the region .
Almost all the problems facing the Middle East and north Africa today have international implications .
Iran 's nuclear issue is but one of these , and certainly not the biggest ; but in addressing the Middle East 's other problems , much depends on the manner in which this one is resolved .
In order to be successful , any dialogue must use the language of politics and diplomacy .
President Rouhani 's platform of prudence and hope is a practical translation of the idea of dialogue among nations into the realm of politics .
And this is more necessary than ever at a time when a range of overlapping political crises are threatening global catastrophe .
With the initiative of Rouhani , who enjoys widespread support from almost all segments of Iranian society , I hope this country will succeed in steering a path towards global dialogue .
The opportunity to diplomatically resolve differences between Iran and the west , including the impasse over the nuclear issue , presented itself many years ago during my presidency .
That opportunity was missed , for reasons that are now public knowledge .
To understand why , one only needs read the memoirs of Jack Straw , then British foreign secretary , or Mohamed ElBaradei , then secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency â€ “ or indeed the memoirs of Rouhani , who was then the chief negotiator of the Iranian nuclear delegation .
More than a decade ago , although agreement appeared possible , diplomacy failed .
After 9/11 , the US initiated costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , with Iraq invaded on the false pretext that it was developing weapons of mass destruction .
It is no surprise that , in this political atmosphere , diplomacy with Iran ended in failure .
Israel , too , sabotaged the chance for the west to reach an agreement with Iran , by injecting scepticism and doubt at the time .
On the eve of Rouhani 's speech at the UN , Israel has again begun a campaign to discredit him because it fears the end of tension between Iran and the west .
Those who are trapped by bitter experience make every effort to disrupt the progress of diplomacy once again .
These people fail to realise a simple point about the relationship between domestic and foreign policy .
President Rouhani 's government was elected by a society seeking positive change , at a time when Iran and the wider region was desperately in need of prudence and hope .
This vote was not limited to a specific political camp ; as well as many reformers , many political prisoners and a significant body of conservatives had a share in Rouhani 's victory .
For the first time there is an opportunity to create a national consensus above and beyond partisan factionalism
â€ “ one that may address the political predicaments of the country , with an emphasis on dialogue and mutual understanding globally .
Explicit public support from the supreme leader of the Islamic republic provides Rouhani and his colleagues with the necessary authority for a diplomatic resolution of a number of foreign policy issues with the west , not just the nuclear issue .
A peace - seeking Iran can contribute as a willing partner not only to solving its own differences with the global powers , but also to overcoming some of the region 's chronic political disputes .
But it requires a degree of courage and optimism from the west to listen to the voices of the Iranian people who have been painfully targeted by unjust sanctions , which have threatened the very fabric of civil society and democratic infrastructures .
Failure now to create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue will only boost extremist forces on all sides .
The consequences of such a failure will be not only regional , but global .
For a better world â€ “ for the Iranian people and the next generation across the globe â€ “
I earnestly hope that Rouhani will receive a warm and meaningful response at the United Nations .
Iran today is different from the Iran of years ago , and the consequences of the Islamic revolution are still playing out .
Our positive and negative experiences of the past 16 years have added another dimension to the reforms that Rouhani is conducting at both domestic and international levels ; they have enriched the Islamic republic 's democratic capacities and added , I very much hope , to the experience of the international community .
The Iranian people 's vote for Rouhani and his agenda for change has provided an unrivalled and possibly unrepeatable opportunity for Iran , the west and all local and regional powers .
With a foreign policy based on dialogue and diplomacy at the heart of the Middle East , we can imagine a better world for the east and the west â€ “ including the diplomatic resolution of Iran 's nuclear issue , which is utterly feasible if there is goodwill and fairness ."
2013-09-24,"Hassan Rouhani 's overtures to the US and the west appear to be an attempt not just to re - engage , but to include many of the region 's intractable issues as part of a grand bargain that Iran could play a lead role in solving .
Top of the agenda at any meetings in New York is not likely to be sanctions that continue to cripple Iran 's economy but the crisis in Syria , which is battering Tehran economically and also poses an enormous threat to the new regional order that Iran helps underpin .
Despite the ebb and flow of the battlefield in Syria , the war itself has been in stalemate for more than 12 months , with neither side able to press home its gains .
Mutual destruction in a savage proxy war seems far more likely for all stakeholders than the chances of a decisive victor somehow emerging from the ruins .
Iran is well aware of this , as are the Assad regime in Damascus , Saudi Arabia , Russia , Qatar , the US and Jordan , all of whom have at various points in the past 30 months tried unsuccessfully to manouvere the crisis to their favour .
But rather than rendering diplomacy useless , this abject lack of success has reaffirmed that there is no other solution to Syria .
Relentless violence will not tip the balance in this fight – unless things continue to deteriorate in such a way that all stakeholders pile into what would be an apocalyptic all - in regional brawl .
The consequences of such a folly are something that none in the region want to deal with .
And so , when Barack Obama stood down the US missile ships and Bashar al - Assad – under Russian pressure – vowed to surrender the most important strategic weapons in his arsenal , a moment of rare clarity emerged .
Here , suddenly , was a momentum that Iran could safely join .
More importantly it could add to a current of de - escalation by sitting down with arch foes , who had all stared down their barrels , and blinked .
Neither Obama , Rouhani – nor Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamanei – have anything to lose by a presidential handshake now .
Instead , they have much to gain .
Friends and foes of Assad alike have now found common ground – one clear point of trust in more than two years of acrimony ; none of them wants Syria to get further out of hand .
So , where does that leave the other issues ?
Iran 's nuclear program and the US , Israeli insistence that it is providing cover for a nearly completed missile capability ; the moribund Israeli , Palestinian peace process ; the damage already done in Syria , whose boundaries are being tested along with all the neighbouring post - Ottoman states ; and a region that is increasingly polarised by Sunni - Shia divide .
For the first time in several decades there could now be a moment to get movement on some of these and other intractable issues .
Finding anything like a solution for Syria would be a momentous advance , as would finding a just outcome for the Israel - Palestinian standoff .
Both seems to be bridges way too far ahead of even a handshake .
But the many stakeholders in the Middle East seem to sense that this is a genuine window of hope that could rapidly be shuttered again , to devastating effect .
Any bargaining would be done in an environment of extreme stakes .
Damascus remains an existential issue for Tehran , as Israel does for the US .
Any tradeoffs would have to be exhaustively considered .
The signs are though that the most crucial period in global diplomacy in several generations could be about to begin ."
2013-09-24,"A much - anticipated meeting between the US president Barack Obama and the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani did not happen on Tuesday , according to White House officials .
There had been speculation that the pair would meet on the fringes of the United Nations general assembly in New York , in what would have been the first such encounter since the Islamic revolution toppled the shah of Iran in 1979 .
But Obama administration officials said that while the US offered a meeting , the Iranian delegation turned it down , saying it was "" too complicated "" .
Officials from the two countries have been discussing the logistics of an "" encounter "" in the UN complex in mid - town Manhattan for several days , a UN official confirmed to the press pool travelling with Obama .
In the end though , the official said , it was "" too complicated for Iranians to do at this point "" .
There s was no immediate statement from the Iranian delegation .
But Press TV , Tehran 's English - language television station , gave alcohol as the reason that Rouhani had missed one possible venue for a handshake or a few shared words , the lunch traditionally hosted by the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - Moon on the opening day of the general assembly .
When guests gathered in the delegates lounge of the UN building , they were seated at tables upon which white and red wine were served – a facility that proved too much for the Muslim theologian Rouhani .
The White House said that a meeting would go ahead on Thursday between the US secretary of state , John Kerry , his Iranian counterpart and other foreign ministers from the other permanent security council members , plus Germany .
That meeting is intended to address reviving negotiations over Iran 's nuclear programme .
In Israel , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday warned that the world "" should not be fooled "" by signs of moderation by Rouhani and must keep up the pressure on Tehran .
"" Iran thinks soothing words and token actions will enable it to continue on its path to the bomb , "" Netanyahu said .
In his UN speech , Obama said he had assigned Kerry to oversee negotiations with Tehran .
In the past those talks had been led by a succession of State Department diplomats , and critics had complained there was no one in the administration who was in charge of US - Iran policy .
He also offered Rouhani an important symbolic gesture , making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA 's well - documented role in the ousting of Iran 's democratically - elected government in 1953 . ""
This mistrust has deep roots .
Iranians have long complained of a history of US interference in their affairs , and America 's role in overthrowing an Iranian government during the cold war , "" Obama said .
The reference to the CIA 's part in the ousting of Mohammad Mosaddegh , Iran 's democratically elected leader , marked a first official admission of that role , and represented an important gesture to Rouhani .
It will be seen in Iran as a diplomatic victory and belated acknowledgement of a long - festering Iranian sense of injustice .
The coup , support by both the US and the UK , paved the way for the dictatorship of the shah , and then the 1979 Islamic revolution against it .
"" I do n't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight .
The suspicions run too deep .
But I do believe if we can resolve the issue of Iran 's nuclear programme that can be a major step , "" Obama said .
The abortive attempt to arrange a meeting between Obama and Rouhani was an echo of a similar incident in 2000 when it was expected that the two leaders at the time , Bill Clinton and Mohammad Khatami , would break the ice in the frozen relationship with the same kind of "" chance encounter "" , but Khatami pulled out at the last moment .
The Iranian skittishness on both occasions reflected the delicate stand - off between hawks and doves in Tehran .
Moderate leaders like Rouhani and Khatami have to choose their battles carefully and not give hostages to fortunes .
Being pictured with an American president without being able to deliver real diplomatic or economic gains for Iran could be cast as weakness or even betrayal if the political winds in Iran change once again .
"" The Iranians have an internal dynamic that they have to manage and the relationship with the United States is clearly quite different than the relationship that Iran has with other Western nations , "" a senior administration official told reporters .
The last few encounters between US and Iranian officials have been brief affairs .
The last one was in the Hague at a conference on Afghanistan where the late American special envoy Richard Holbrooke had a "" cordial "" chat with an Iranian deputy foreign minister in 2009 .
The choreography of diplomatic handshakes at UN gatherings in New York has a long history ; getting it wrong can have painful consequences .
In 2004 the then British foreign secretary , Jack Straw , got into hot water after he shook the hands of the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe , at a UN reception in New York ; Straw later claimed he had made the gesture by mistake in the dark ."
2013-09-24,"President Obama on Tuesday pledged to focus his foreign policy efforts on the Middle East , stepping up efforts to reach an agreement on Iran 's nuclear programme and leading an international push to support the creation of a Palestinian state as a solution to the Arab - Israeli conflict .
In a mark of the importance and urgency with which the White House treats the need for a nuclear deal with the new Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , Obama assigned his secretary of state , John Kerry , to oversee negotiations with Tehran .
In the past those talks had been led by a succession of State Department diplomats , and critics had complained there was no one in the administration who was in charge of US - Iran policy .
He also offered Rouhani an important symbolic gesture , making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA 's well - documented role in the ousting of Iran 's democratically - elected government in 1953 .
President Obama 's speech , delivered from the podium of the UN general assembly , represented a striking admission that his administration 's attempt to "" pivot to Asia "" had been stymied by the intractable nature of the Middle East 's problems , and by the danger of the spread of weapons of mass destruction in the region , such as last month 's use of chemical weapons in Syria .
Obama said that if the UN security council failed to pass a strong resolution enforcing the dismantling of the Syrian regime 's chemical weapons arsenal , then the institution would show itself "" incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws "" .
However , in his UN speech Obama made clear that the US saw the Iranian nuclear programme as a much more immediate and serious threat to its core interests , and he responded to the overtures of the newly - elected leadership in Tehran by putting Kerry in charge of the coming critical weeks of intense negotiations .
"" Given President Rouhani 's stated commitment to reach an agreement , I am directing John Kerry to pursue this effort with the Iranian government , in close coordination with the European Union , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Russia and China , "" the president said .
The move mirrored Rouhani 's decision to put his own foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , in charge of the talks , breaking from the practice of the past eight years of abortive negotiations of assigning them to senior officials .
The foreign ministers of all seven countries are due to meet for the first time at the UN on Thursday .
"" Directing Secretary Kerry to lead this signals that the negotiations may be elevated to the foreign minister level , which would be very good news , "" said Trita Parsi , the head of the National Iranian American Council , and the author of a book on US - Iranian negotiations , A Single Roll of the Dice . ""
This means that far greater political will is being invested into the diplomatic process , which in turn increases the cost of failure .
That is exactly what is needed to overcome the political obstacles to a deal . ""
Obama acknowledged the difficulties ahead .
"" The roadblocks may prove to be too great , but I firmly believe a diplomatic path must be tested , "" he said .
Referencing the US involvement in a 1953 coup , Obama said : "" This mistrust has deep roots .
Iranians have long complained of a history of US interference in their affairs , and America 's role in overthrowing an Iranian government during the cold war . ""
The reference to the CIA 's part in the ousting of Mohammad Mosaddegh , Iran 's democratically elected leader , marked a first official admission of that role , and represented an important gesture to Rouhani .
It will be seen in Iran as a diplomatic victory and belated acknowledgement of a long - festering Iranian sense of injustice .
The coup , support by both the US and the UK , paved the way for the dictatorship of the shah , and then the 1979 Islamic revolution against it .
"" I do n't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight .
The suspicions run too deep .
But I do believe if we can resolve the issue of Iran 's nuclear programme that can be a major step , "" Obama said .
Recalling that he had personally written to President Rouhani , and before that to Iran 's supreme leader Ali Khamenei , Obama declared that "" America prefers to resolve our concerns peacefully "" and reassured both Iranian leaders that the US had no desire to seek regime change in Tehran .
Obama also acknowledged that Khamenei had issued a fatwa ( a religious ruling ) against the development of nuclear weapons , which was echoed by Rouhani 's more recent insistence that Iran would never make a bomb .
These statements made by our respective governments should offer the basis for a meaningful agreement .
We should be able to achieve a resolution that respects the rights of the Iranian people , while giving the world confidence that the Iranian program is peaceful .
To succeed , conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable .
Turning to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , Obama had no new initiatives to announce .
Instead , the significance of the speech for the region was the centrality he gave the issue to US foreign policy goals in the remaining three years of his presidency .
It represented a response to criticisms that his administration had pursued a hands - off policy in the region because of the enormity of the obstacles to peace .
Obama said : "" I believe there is a growing recognition within Israel that the occupation of the West Bank is tearing at the democratic fabric of the Jewish state . ""
He said the right of Israel to live in security had to be balanced by the Palestinians ' right to live in security and dignity in a sovereign state .
The rival leaders in the region had taken risks , he argued .
The time was now ripe for the entire international community to get behind the pursuit of peace , Obama said .
"" Now , the rest of us must also be willing to take risks . ""
"" Real breakthroughs on these two issues â€ “ Iran 's nuclear program and Israeli - Palestinian peace â€ “ would have a profound and positive impact on the entire Middle East and north Africa , "" Obama said .
Obama also used the speech as an opportunity to drive home his demand for a strong UN security council resolution on Syria that would require the Assad regime to submit its chemical weapons supplies to international control or face tough consequences .
The search for a draft resolution has been delayed in recent days with Russia objecting to any inclusion of a threat of force in the event of Syrian non - compliance .
In words that were clearly directed at Russia 's president Vladimir Putin , who has acted as Assad 's main ally throughout the chemical weapons crisis , Obama said that the evidence was overwhelming that the Syrian government had unleashed sarin gas against its own civilians .
"" It is an insult to human reason â€ “ and to the legitimacy of this institution â€ “ to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack . "" Obama pitched the search for a security council resolution on Syria in grand terms , saying that the credibility of the entire UN system as a means to resolve conflict depended on it .
A failure by the security council to agree on a resolution would have significant consequences : "" It would show that the UN is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws .
On the other hand , if we succeed , it will send a powerful message that the use of chemical weapons has no place in the 21st century , and that this body means what it says .
"" In an implicit rebuke to Putin , who earlier this month in an article in the New York Times , criticised Obama 's belief in US exceptionalism , Obama said : "" Some may disagree , but I believe that America is exceptional â€ “ in part because we have shown a willingness , through the sacrifice of blood and treasure , to stand up not only for our own narrow self - interest , but for the interests of all . """
2013-09-25,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , has put an end to eight years of Holocaust denial under his firebrand predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by condemning the "" crime "" of mass killings of Jews by the Nazis .
In an interview after his largely conciliatory speech at the UN general assembly on Tuesday , Rouhani accepted that the Holocaust had taken place and called it reprehensible .
"" I 've said before that I am not a historian , and when it comes to speaking of the dimensions of the Holocaust , it is the historians that should reflect , "" Rouhani told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour . ""
But , in general , I can tell you that any crime that happens in history against humanity , including the crime the Nazis created towards the Jews as well as non - Jews is reprehensible and condemnable .
Whatever criminality they committed against the Jews , we condemn . ""
Rouhani 's comments were in marked contrast to those made by Ahmadinejad , who grabbed headlines for making inflammatory statements about the Holocaust during his time in office .
Ahmadinejad repeatedly called the Holocaust a myth and a lie perpetrated by the west . ""
They launched the myth of the Holocaust , "" Ahmadinejad said in a speech at a pro - Palestinian rally in Tehran in September 2009 .
"" They lied , they put on a show and then they support the Jews â€ ¦
The pretext for establishing the Zionist regime is a lie â€ ¦ a lie which relies on an unreliable claim , a mythical claim , and the occupation of Palestine has nothing to do with the Holocaust . ""
Meir Javedanfar , an Iranian politics lecturer at Interdisciplinary Centre ( IDC ) in Herzliya , Israel , interpreted Rouhani 's remarks as the limit he could go within the political and cultural constraints placed upon him .
"" We could say he is disputing the numbers , which is a valid argument , "" Javedanfar said .
"" But he is not saying that six million were not killed .
He is saying whatever the numbers , which could be six million or less , was a crime . ""
Rouhani pushed the envelope as far as it could go , Javedanfar said , without infuriating the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and other conservatives back home .
In the CNN interview , Rouhani said that acceptance of the Holocaust did not require the acceptance of the occupation of Palestine by Israel . ""
This does not mean that on the other hand you can say Nazis committed crimes against a group , now , therefore , they must usurp the land of another group and occupy it .
This too , is an act that should be condemned , "" he said .
During his visit to the UN in New York , Rouhani attempted to revamp the image of Iran so badly hurt under Ahmadinejad .
He was accompanied by Iran 's only Jewish MP , Siamak Moreh Sedgh , and made no direct mention of Israel in his speech to the general assembly on Tuesday .
Despite the charm offensive , Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , ordered his delegation to boycott Rouhani 's speech at the general assembly on Tuesday ."
2013-09-25,
2013-09-25,"With expectations so high , Hassan Rouhani 's speech to the general assembly was never going to be an easy one .
In Iran , radicals will have listened intently to their new president , keen to ensure he would n't be too soft on the west , especially the United States , Tehran 's sworn enemy since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
After all , 34 years on , faithfuls still chant "" death to America "" every Friday after performing their weekly prayers .
Reformists , too , had pinned their hopes on Rouhani , expecting him to impress the world with a moderate voice , and to globally revamp Iran 's image , so badly hurt under eight years of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Being a moderate , an ultimate insider who has tried to bridge the gap between major factions of the Islamic republic , Rouhani succeeded in being just moderate enough – albeit judged by Iranian standards .
He did n't impress either group , nor did he particularly disappoint them .
It was a speech that both sides seemed to agree was worth listening to .
The US president , Barack Obama , also had to consider two sides : sceptics such as Israel and the pro - sanctions congress on one side , and those pushing for direct talks , on the other .
Like Obama , Rouhani made sure his speech was a step forward , however minimal , and that it did not add fuel to the existing tensions , not further complicate the current standoff .
Nevertheless it was positive .
Western representatives at the UN remained seated and did not join Israel 's inevitable boycott of the speech .
Intriguingly , Rouhani did not mention , even once , the word that so infamously was associated with his predecessor : Israel ( or , as Iranian leaders prefer , "" the Zionist regime "" ) .
At the end of his speech , he recited a verse from the Qu'ran that talked about the Jewish holy book , the Torah .
Those two choices should have pleased the sole Iranian Jewish MP accompanying Rouhani in his UN visit to New York .
Like Obama , Rouhani played to the domestic audience as well the international .
More than half of his speech would have satisfied Iranian radicals enough that they could keep quiet about the rest .
Rouhani talked of the dire consequences of international sanctions on Iran , complaining that they have destroyed lives in the manner that wars destroy them .
At least on the sanctions issue , he was almost the voice of an entire nation .
He insisted that Iran was no threat to the international community , has no intention to raise the stakes and believed peace was within reach .
But he also outlined the conditions under which Iran would agree to a face - saving solution that might work for both sides .
For once , in contrast to the years under Ahmadinejad , Iran 's new president did not issue a direct threat to any nation .
"" Iran poses absolutely no threat to the world or the region , "" he said , adding that nuclear weapons had no place in the Islamic republic .
He addressed Obama directly , saying he had listened carefully to the US president 's speech .
"" We expect to hear a consistent voice from Washington , "" he said , apparently referring to the inconsistency between the administration 's policy on Iran and the more strident voices emanating from Congress .
He also invoked Iran 's great ancient poet , Ferdowsi . ""
Be relentless in the striving for the cause of Good , "" he said , reciting Ferdowsi 's verse . ""
To bring the spring , you must banish the winter . ""
Rouhani might have disappointed many for apparently declining an offer made by American officials to meet Obama .
But he has already brought encouraging changes , not least putting an end to the embarrassment of the Ahmadinejad years and starting a new chapter for improved relations with the west , or as he would call it "" constructive engagement "" with the international community ."
2013-09-25,"The Iran - watching community is in danger of suffering whiplash .
After a weeks - long love - bombing campaign conducted by the new Iranian leadership in the run - up to the UN general assembly , President Hassan Rouhani 's speech on Tuesday afternoon seemed strikingly old - school .
He had promised a new , freer Iran and a break from the past on the world stage , but the speech was very much in the vague but condemnatory style of official Tehran pronouncements .
Rouhani declared that "" peace is within reach "" but gave no hint as how to get there .
And he opted not to have a crowd - pleasing meeting with Barack Obama .
The charm offensive appeared to slow down if not come to a halt .
Today , however , it was on again .
The foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , an urbane and skilled diplomat , said he wanted "" a jump - start to the negotiations ... with a view to reaching an agreement within the shortest span . ""
The negotiations in question start on Thursday afternoon at the UN .
They will be attended by Zarif and the foreign ministers of a six - nation negotiating group ( known both as the E3 + 3 or the P5 + 1 for obscure reasons no one really cares about any longer ) , convened by the EU foreign policy chief , Cathy Ashton .
Importantly , the meeting will bring together Zarif and John Kerry , in what will be the most substantial exchange between Iranian and US top officials since the Islamic revolution of 1979 , particularly as the much anticipated Obama - Rouhani handshake failed to materialise .
( Madeleine Albright and the then Iranian foreign minister , Kamal Kharrazi , attended the same meeting in 2000 but did not speak .
Colin Powell shook hands with Kharrazi the next year but did n't get beyond small talk ) .
So which version of the new Iran is real ?
The get - on - with - it pragmatist or the ponderously - cautious theologian ?
A British diplomat in New York argued it is wrong to see a contradiction .
A lot of pundits and journalists have been getting over - excited over Rouhani .
They expected some kind of ' Love Actually ' * moment , a Hollywood ending , at the general assembly and instead we got rather an academic speech from someone who is an academic .
We found it encouraging .
Like all general assembly speeches it was substantially or wholly aimed at a domestic audience , but he moved as far as he could on the substantive issues .
Although the Zarif - Kerry encounter at Ashton 's meeting may be laden with symoblism , it may not be immediately clear if negotiations positions have shifted enough to break the stalemate of the past decade .
Senior diplomats from the six nation negotiating group ( US , UK , France , Germany , Russia and China ) will meet for an hour mid - afternoon to make sure their are all on the same page .
Then the group 's foreign ministers will come together for half an hour before Zarif joins them for a short session expected to last not much more than another half hour .
The ' deliverable ' at the end of the afternoon will be agreement on when to hold the next meeting , expected to a nuts - and - bolts session in Geneva in October , and what precise form it will take .
Only in Switzerland is it likely to become evident whether Rouhani 's election has brought the sides any closer together .
This may be less like Hollywood and more like Iranian cinema , where the true meaning only emerges slowly and is subject to multiple interpretations .

2013-09-25,"The speeches of the US and Iranian presidents , Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani , at the UN general assembly have tempered Iranians ' hopes of an overnight detente , but the need for a thaw in relations between the two countries still dominates local political discourse .
Though the 24 September session failed to produce a much - anticipated unofficial meeting between the two leaders , observers expressed confidence in the possibility of future dialogue , even as conservatives remained sceptical of America 's intentions toward the Islamic republic . ""
Perhaps another time , "" read the front - page headline of the reformist newspaper Shargh , which printed a second edition on the morning of 25 September due to high sales .
The newspaper noted that Rouhani chose to skip a UN lunch where a chance meeting with Obama would have been possible , adding that Obama was absent from the hall during Rouhani 's speech .
However , it added that "" both sides were weighing the pros and cons "" and inching towards an appropriate structure for bilateral talks .
Ali , a 29-year - old teacher from north Tehran , said he saw this as an appropriate strategy given the existence of conservative groups in both countries . ""
[ Rouhani and Obama ] wo n't go that fast because the reaction would be radical , both here and there .
The existence of these groups is based on the animosity .
Now we have two intelligent people who know that if they move too fast , the reaction from these two groups is going to be destructive .
Their strategy is to take things slow , moderate the tone so as not to anger these elements too much . ""
Ali also noted that Rouhani 's speech lacked the cryptic allusions that typify the UN addresses of Iranian leaders . ""
The first segment was in keeping with the framework all Iranian presidents must work with , but the second part was amazing , "" he said .
"" When he said that peace was reachable , it was a very direct message to America : if you want to have peace , now is the time .
"" The impression of a historic opportunity for a thaw in Iran - US relations was further bolstered by the statements of Obama , whose speech included an unprecedented recognition of Iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear programme , local media noted .
"" Individuals play a large role in the course of international relations , "" said a Tehran University academic specialising in foreign affairs .
"" There is a big difference between the pessimistic views of George W Bush and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the approaches of Mr Rouhani and Mr Obama . ""
The contrast between the past strategies of Ahmadinejad and the new administration was also evident in Rouhani 's comments on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , in which he focused on human rights .
"" You can be the same as Ahmadinejad and deny the Holocaust , creating more enemies , or you can be Rouhani and mention the suffering of Palestinians , "" said Astareh , a 31-year - old Green Movement activist .
"" You are still accusing a certain nation , but in a more constructive way . ""
Though commending Rouhani for his strong , straightforward approach , Iranians here also noted his tacit willingness to backpedal on key tenets of Iranian foreign policy .
Hamid , 40 , who runs a juice stand in Tehran , said he stayed up until the early hours of the morning to watch Rouhani 's speech live on TV .
"" It 's obvious he 's backed off .
His speech seemed to say : ' Why do n't you take a step back and we 'll also take a step back , ' "" he said .
"" There 's no choice but for the United States and Iran to go at it directly face - to - face . ""
This moderated approach does not sit well with Iran 's hardline factions , who remain sceptical of the United States 's willingness to negotiate with Iran on an equal footing .
Kayhan , the conservative daily newspaper associated with the supreme leader , ran a front - page article outlining "" Obama 's empty threats against Iran "" .
"" Some people , for all their ignorance , believe that problems can be solved by writing letters to the nation 's enemies , "" Hojattol - eslam Mohammad Zaar Foumani , head of the rightwing political grouping Jebhe Mardomi - e - Eslaahat told the state - run news agency
Fars , as quoted by Kayhan .
Calling the current strategy a delusion , Foumani claimed that the west 's animosity towards Islam and Islamic democracy were deep - rooted , concluding that "" asking too much of the enemy will not help [ Iran ] "" .
But observers also noted that , 34 years after the Iranian revolution , the hardliners ' idea of America 's inherent hostility towards the Islamic republic was becoming outdated in the eyes of many Iranians . ""
Instead of worrying about dialogue with America and Rouhani 's chance of success , conservatives should be concerned that society no longer believes in the idea of American animosity , "" the leading Tehran intellectual Sadegh Zibakalam wrote in a Shargh editorial .
"" These are the values of a new generation of Iranians . """
2013-09-25,"After the dramatic buildup , Tuesday 's speeches at the UN did not disappoint .
Iran 's newly - elected president , Hassan Rouhani , arrived in New York at the head of the biggest charm offensive in the 34-year history of US - Iranian estrangement .
And neither in his speech , nor Barack Obama 's earlier , did the historic opportunity of repairing that damage slip from view .
By the end of play , both presidents had committed themselves to direct dialogue , assigning their foreign ministers to oversee the task .
Each made important symbolic steps .
Mr Obama 's was to officially admit for the first time the CIA 's involvement in the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Tehran in 1953 .
Mr Rouhani 's was to declare that peace with the US was within reach .
When addressing Mr Obama , he used the word president in English , not Farsi .
Unlike his belligerent predecessor who grew used at these occasions to lecture rows of empty chairs , Mr Rouhani eschewed all mention of Israel , although he clearly alluded to it , challenging the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and the occupation of the Palestinian territories .
If two - thirds of his speech was aimed at shoring up his credentials at home , one third was addressed to his western audience .
And the message was that Iran can do business , as long as it is allowed to continue enriching uranium for exclusively and transparently peaceful purposes .
Iran 's presidents past and present have gone to extraordinary lengths –
Mr Rouhani writing in the Washington Post and Mohammad Khatami in the Guardian – to put two basic messages across .
The first is that Mr Rouhani has full authority to negotiate on Iran 's behalf .
Every centre of power is behind his drive to reach an agreement about Iran 's nuclear programme , or at least will not impede it .
Had the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wanted to toss a spanner in the works , one speech to students would have sufficed .
He has not done that .
Rather , he has endorsed diplomacy to which he has attached the label "" heroic leniency "" .
The second message is that the stakes are high .
The implication of the articles and the accompanying pardon of 80 political prisoners is that if this moment is squandered , the consequences will be widespread .
Inside Iran , it would be another hammer blow to the reform movement .
Failure would shatter the authority of the president , who was elected in a free and fair vote .
Outside Iran , it is no exaggeration to say that three theatres of war , could be affected by these negotiations : Syria , Afghanistan and Israel - Palestine .
The possibility of an historic breakthrough deal was not lost on Mr Obama .
He used language aimed consciously at appealing to Tehran , by stressing a relationship based on mutual respect .
This was a good start by both leaders on what might yet be a long and arduous journey ."
2013-09-25,"Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , declared that "" peace is within reach "" on Tuesday , in a hotly anticipated speech at the United Nations in which he offered immediate negotiations aimed at removing any "" reasonable concerns "" over his country 's nuclear programme .
Rouhani argued that in return , Iran wanted the international community to recognise its right to enrich uranium , the issue that has been at the heart of the diplomatic impasse over the past 11 years .
The Iranian president , elected in June , was speaking a few hours Barack Obama had stood at the same podium and pledged to focus his administration 's foreign policy in its remaining three years on the Middle East , particularly on reaching a diplomatic settlement in Iran .
Obama assigned his secretary of state , John Kerry , to oversee negotiations with Tehran and offered Rouhani an important symbolic gesture , making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA 's well - documented role in the ousting of Iran 's democratically - elected government in 1953 .
But despite the positive gestures a much - anticipated meeting between the two leaders not materialise .
The White House said it offered to arrange a discussion in the margins of the general assembly but said that Rouhani 's office deemed it was "" too complicated "" .
He did not go into details and a meeting with Barack Obama did not materialise .
The White House said it offered to arrange a discussion in the margins of the general assembly but said that Rouhani 's office deemed it was "" too complicated "" .
In his speech however , Rouhani said he had "" listened carefully "" to Obama address earlier in the day .
He concluded that if Washington did not give in to the influence of "" warmongers "" , then the US and Iran "" can arrive at a framework to manage our differences "" .
The framework Rouhani suggested for dealing with the stand - off over Iran 's nuclear aspirations offered a trade between increased Iranian transparency and international recognition of Iran 's right to enrich .
"" Our national interests make it imperative that we remove any and all reasonable concerns about Iran 's peaceful nuclear programme , "" he said , adding that Iran "" is prepared to engage immediately in time - bound and result - oriented talks to build mutual confidence and the removal of mutual uncertainties with full transparency .
"" On the other hand , he said that the country 's mastery of the technology had reached such an "" industrial scale "" , and so could not longer be reversed .
So the world should instead recognise Iran 's basic right to carry out all parts of the nuclear fuel cycle .
The vague nature of Rouhani 's offer , the accusatory tone of much of the rest of his speech , and the failure to organise a meeting with Obama all served to dampen expectations of an immediate breakthrough .
Diplomats and observers at the UN said it was clear that Rouhani 's speech was principally aimed at a domestic audience , particularly Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei and the regime 's hardliners who are suspicious of Rouhani 's charm offensive in the West .
In his UN speech earlier in the day , Obama made clear that the US saw the Iranian nuclear programme as a more immediate and serious threat to its core interest .
He responded to the overtures of the newly - elected leadership in Tehran by putting Kerry in charge of the coming critical weeks of intense negotiations . ""
Given President Rouhani 's stated commitment to reach an agreement , I am directing John Kerry to pursue this effort with the Iranian government , in close coordination with the European Union , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Russia and China , "" the president said .
A senior administration official described the move as "" a significant elevation "" in the status of the talks .
It move mirrored Rouhani 's decision to put his own foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , in charge of the talks from the Iranian side , breaking from the practice of the past eight years of abortive negotiations of assigning them to senior officials .
The foreign ministers of all seven countries are due to meet for the first time at the UN on Thursday .
"" Directing secretary Kerry to lead this , signals that the negotiations may be elevated to the foreign minister level , which would be very good news , "" said Trita Parsi , the head of the National Iranian American Council , and the author of a book on US - Iranian negotiations , A Single Roll of the Dice .
""
This means that far greater political will is being invested into the diplomatic process , which in turn increases the cost of failure .
That is exactly what is needed to overcome the political obstacles to a deal . ""
Obama acknowledged the difficulties ahead .
"" The roadblocks may prove to be too great , but I firmly believe a diplomatic path must be tested , "" he said .
Obama offered Rouhani an important symbolic gesture , making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA 's well - documented role in the ousting of Iran 's democratically elected government in 1953 .
"" This mistrust has deep roots .
Iranians have long complained of a history of US interference in their affairs , and America 's role in overthrowing an Iranian government during the cold war , "" he said .
The reference to the CIA 's part in the ousting of Mohammad Mosaddegh , Iran 's democratically elected leader , marked a first official admission of that role , and represented an important gesture to Rouhani .
It will be seen in Iran as a diplomatic victory and belated acknowledgement of a long - festering Iranian sense of injustice .
The coup , supported by both the US and the UK , paved the way for the dictatorship of the shah , and then the 1979 Islamic revolution against it .
"" I do n't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight .
The suspicions run too deep .
But I do believe if we can resolve the issue of Iran 's nuclear programme that can be a major step , "" Obama said .
The US president expressed optimism about this week 's talks .
"" We should be able to achieve a resolution that respects the rights of the Iranian people , while giving the world confidence that the Iranian programme is peaceful .
To succeed , conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable . ""
Thursday 's talks involve Rouhani 's foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , Kerry , the UK foreign secretary , William Hague and foreign ministers from Russia , China , France and Germany .
Much will depend on how far Rouhani is prepared to go to remove what he described as the "" reasonable concerns "" about Iran 's nuclear intentions .
If that involves Iran 's acceptance of strict limits on the degree of enrichment allowed and a stricter regime of inspections , there may room for a deal ."
2013-09-26,"We are witnessing an extraordinary conjuncture , or combination of circumstances , a critical time in the world of defence and security .
Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , is holding out the prospect of a breakthrough after his country 's three decade cold war , and nuclear standoff , with the US .
Russia and the US have agreed to a peaceful solution to rid Syria of its chemical weapons stocks .
And the world has witnessed a horrific terrorist attack by al - Shabaab extremists on a soft target , a shopping mall in the Kenyan capital , Nairobi .
These are connected .
Vladimir Putin warned that militants fighting President Bashar al - Assad in Syria could strike elsewhere .
"" The militant groups ( in Syria ) did not come out of nowhere , and they will not vanish into thin air , "" Putin said , adding "" We are now witnessing a terrible tragedy unfold in Kenya .
The militants came from another country , as far as we can judge , and are committing horrendous , bloody crimes .
"" Moscow has for long been concerned about Islamist militants on and within Russia 's borders .
Most western commentators say al - Shabaab will stick to its part of the world .
Though al - Shabaab announced in 2012 it had linked up with al - Qaeda , it is unlikely to link up with other Islamist groups such as al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQM ) .
However , this North African al - Qaeda affiliate has links to Boko Haram .
Boko Haram has killed about 3,000 people in northern Nigeria over the past four years and Nigeria 's security forces are having great difficulty in hunting it down .
British spooks suggest that it does not present a great threat to the UK since most Nigerians in Britain are Christians from the south of the country , not Moslems from the north .
Yet those in the British Foreign Office tasked with searching for "" over the horizon "" dangers have singled out Nigeria as posing an increasing security threat .
Nigeria has special problems .
Adewale Maja - Pearce , a Nigerian author recently observed : "" Today Nigeria - the world 's seventh most populuos country - is the world 's second - largest importer of Champagne but is unable to deliver more than a few hours of electricity a day "" .
The country 's chronic infrastructure problem makes Lagos a classic case for David Kilcullen , former counter - insurgency adviser to General David Petraeus in Iraq and Nato forces in Afghanistan .
His main concern in Out of the Mountains , The Coming Age of The Urban Guerrilla , is the vulnerability of large , and fast growing coastal cities of the future . ""
In the future environment of overcrowded , undergoverned , urban , coastal areas - combined with increasingly excellent remote surveillance capabilities ( including drones , satellites , and signals intelligence ) in remote rural areas - the cover is going to be in the cities "" , he writes .
Nonstate armed groups will be able to draw on the technical skills of urban populations .
Kilcullen cites the example of Syrian rebels who built a homemade armoured vehicle which used a videogame controller to manipulate a remotely mounted machine gun and linked cameras to a flat screen TV to help the driver see - "" urban populations can turn consumer entertainment gadgets into military systems "" .
Back to Syria , and the Middle East , the heart of the most serious , difficult , but solvable disputes .
Unsurprisingly during his speech to the United Nations on Tuesday Rouhani did not mention Israel by name .
He said : "" Iran 's nuclear programme — and for that matter , that of all other countries — must pursue exclusively peaceful purposes "" .
Putin was reported on Thursday to say that Israel 's alleged nuclear weapons stockpile only served to make it "" a target "" and created "" foreign policy problems . ""
He said Syria had developed chemical weapons "" as an alternative to the nuclear weapons of Israel "" , according to AFP , the French news agency .
Putin added that "" the technical advantage of Israel – we need to say this directly – is such that it does n't need nuclear weapons .
Israel is already in a technical military sense several heads above the countries in the region . ""
Israel is estimated now to have 80 nuclear weapons , according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists .
Israel sticks to its longstanding policy of neither confirming nor denying its possession of nuclear arms .
A UN attempt to convene a conference last year to establish a weapons of mass destruction free zone in the Middle East broke down at least partly because of Israel 's refusal to confirm whether it would attend or not .
"" If Israel 's policy on the subject is so frozen that it is unable to come clean , Mr. Obama must let the United States government be honest about Israel 's arsenal and act on those facts , for both America 's good and Israel 's "" , two commentators observed recently in the New York Times .
WMD in the Middle East and the proliferation of armed terrorist groups - some but not all influenced by al - Qaeda ideology - are two of the most serious issues that should be faced up to as a matter of urgency ."
2013-09-27,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , ended a tumultuous week of diplomatic activity in New York with a striking offer to work rapidly to defuse tensions with America , hailing the US as "" a great nation "" .
Speaking at a press conference at a hotel near United Nations headquarters , the newly - elected leader made the most conciliatory remarks heard from Tehran in a decade .
He also offered to prepare a concrete plan for resolving the nuclear stalemate at a new round of negotiations in Geneva on 15 October .
He said Tehran might go even further , hinting at a possible confidence - building measure to be announced at the talks .
But it was Rouhani 's tone that was most remarkable , at the end of a week in which he sought to present Iran as a reborn country , following his June election .
"" The environment that has been created is quite different from the past , and those who have brought the change was the people of Iran , "" he said .
"" The first step has been taken here which is a beginning for better relations with other countries and in particular , between the two great nations of Iran and US .
So the understanding between our peoples will grow and our governments will first stop the escalation of tensions , and then defuse those tensions . ""
The conciliatory language marks a radical change from the presidency of his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and a break from tradition dating to the 1979 revolution of referring to the US as the "" Great Satan "" .
It mirrored a change on the streets of Tehran , where the ritual chanting of "" Death to America "" has almost died out at public gatherings since the elections .
Rouhani said that he was confident the decade - long impasse over Iran 's nuclear programmes would soon be over , and he pointed to the friendly atmosphere at a meeting on Thursday evening between the Iranian foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , and his counterparts from the US , UK , France , Germany , Russia and China .
The meeting was chaired by the European Union foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton .
The Iranian president said the setting of a date for detailed negotiations in Geneva was "" a positive step "" . ""
In the talks in general there is a long of common ground , "" Rouhani said .
"" We have said that Iran will prepare a plan .
Iran will prepare that plan and present it in Geneva and we hope that an even more positive step will be taken at Geneva to help settle the nuclear issue . ""
He did not go into specifics , but observers said it was a possible reference to the implementation of an early confidence - building measure .
Rouhani indicated that the process of defusing tensions over the nuclear programme would be a phased but relatively swift affair , involving such trust - building steps . ""
Step by step we will build confidence between our presidents and our countries .
With sufficient will on both sides â€ “
and I assure you that on Iran 's side the will is
100 % â€ “ the nuclear file will be resolved in a short period of time , "" Rouhani said , rejecting suggestions that his flexibility at the negotiating table was constrained by hardline forces back in Iran .
"" My government has full authority in these negotiations with support from all three arms of government as well as the people of Iran .
I have complete backing . ""
Western diplomats have said they were impressed by Zarif 's businesslike approach at the foreign ministers ' meeting on Thursday and said he put "" new ideas "" on the table that they did not describe . ""
He made some suggestions about some ideas that they have .
But I would say there 's a lot more to understand , "" said a senior State Department official .
"" He laid out some thoughts that he had about what he thought this whole process might look like , what he thought might be some of the elements in a first step .
And it was a very useful insight into Iranian interests , thinking , process , what their timeline is . """
2013-09-27,"The smile offensive conducted by Iran 's President Hassan Rouhani at the UN has not been greeted with smiles in Israel .
While welcoming a "" genuine diplomatic solution "" to the Iranian nuclear challenge , the prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , this week warned the world not to be "" fooled by half - measures that merely provide a smokescreen for Iran 's continual pursuit of nuclear weapons "" .
Iran 's history of deceit on this issue calls for rephrasing President Reagan 's famous reference to the Soviet Union : "" Do not trust but verify . ""
Give Rouhani a chance , but test him by his deeds .
Israel neither trusts Rouhani nor fully relies on President Obama 's resolve .
Speaking at the UN general assembly last year , Netanyahu drew a red line at Iranian production of one bomb 's worth of 20 % enriched uranium .
In the past year , however , advances in the Iranian programme have made this red line irrelevant .
In addition , Rouhani was voted in offering another chance for diplomacy , while Obama equivocated on his own red line regarding the use of chemical weapons in Syria .
From Israel 's perspective , spinning open - ended diplomacy while centrifuges continue to spin – and while there is no credible military deterrent – is a dangerous situation .
When nearing the line with its 20 % enrichment , Iran converted most of the excess amounts to oxide form , which could be reprocessed back in a matter of weeks .
At the same time , it added many centrifuges and is installing a new centrifuge generation ( IR-2 m ) , about four times faster than the old type .
With its expanding arsenal and with the more advanced centrifuges , Iran may be able in the coming year to break out to a bomb 's worth of enriched uranium ( over 90 % ) within several weeks , and to a nuclear device within a few months , starting with uranium enriched only to 3.5 % .
Looming over the horizon is an even more dangerous plutonium programme : a heavy - water reactor is under construction at Arak .
Once this reactor becomes "" hot "" it may be impossible to stop through military means , for fear of radiation leakage .
The diplomatic option is further complicated by the fact that it hitherto focused on 20 % enriched uranium .
The P5 + 1 ( United States , Russia , China , United Kingdom , France and Germany ) demanded that Iran cease enrichment to this level , ship out enriched material and close the enrichment facility at Fordow , which is devoted to enriching to 20 % and seemingly invulnerable to air strikes .
Yet it failed to address other developing dimensions of the Iranian programme , which could soon afford Iran the capacity to breakout to a bomb before being stopped .
These include the number of centrifuges , their quality , weaponisation designs and the plutonium track .
Enter Rouhani .
With his charm offensive , he provides relief from the confrontational style of his predecessor .
Yet in the rough terrain of the Middle East , where suspicion is a common trait hardened by long experience , there is ample reason to suspect his motives .
Rouhani is the flesh and blood of an Iranian system which has heavily invested in its nuclear programme and is unlikely to give up on it .
And at the end of the day , he answers to the supreme leader , Ali Hosseini Khamenai .
His recent expressed interest in a quick diplomatic deal is tempered by insistence on continued enrichment .
He has boasted on the record of how he had managed , as the regime 's nuclear negotiator a decade ago , to move the programme forward while engaging the west and averting sanctions .
Are we facing a replay ?
With international sanctions proving crippling – and driving Iran to seek a diplomatic exit – it is important not to relax them before the regime proves it has really changed course , or else it will be impossible to step the pressure up again .
It is equally important not to allow this diplomatic endeavour to drag on endlessly while Iran develops its programme to a critical breakout capacity .
Israelis also believe that for diplomacy to work it must be backed by credible military deterrence .
It may be that Syria 's President Assad was impressed by the US military threat and so opted for a diplomatic deal .
In Israel , however , Obama 's obvious recoiling from enforcing his red line raises questions over his resolve to carry the burdens of prevention in the face of Iran .
This all contributes to a gloomy feeling in Israel that if diplomacy fails , the country will be left alone with a terrible decision between "" the bomb "" and "" the bombing "" .
If diplomacy yields a bad deal , which does not sufficiently set Iran back from breakout capacity , Israel 's dilemma will be no less daunting .

2013-09-28,"A Twitter account belonging to Hassan Rouhani broke news of a historic phone call between the Iranian president and Barack Obama on Friday â€ “ but within hours the friendly tweets he shared with the US president were deleted and replaced with something a little more humdrum .
The original tweets posted Friday afternoon on the English - language Twitter account reflected a friendly and bantering tone to the conversation .
One of the tweets said Rouhani had concluded the phone call by telling Obama to "" have a nice day ! "" and Obama had thanked him and said goodbye in Persian â€ “ "" Khodahafez "" , which means "" God go with you "" .
They recounted a conversation in which Obama was reported to have said to Rouhani : "" I express my respect for you and ppl of # iran .
I 'm convinced that relations between Iran and US will greatly affect region .
If we can make progress on # nuclear file , other issues such as # Syria will certainly be positively affected .
"" Obama was said to have finished the conversation with a light - hearted jab at New York traffic : "" I wish you a safe and pleasant journey and apologize if you 're experiencing the [ horrendous ] traffic in # NYC . ""
The entire exchange was captured in a screengrab by Buzzfeed reporter Andrew Kaczynski before it was deleted .
The replacement tweet simply said the presidents "" expressed their mutual political # will to rapidly solve the # nuclear issue "" : It was followed by a photo of a cheerful - looking Rouhani aboard his flight home to Tehran : A followup tweet managed to combine Twitter shorthand with diplomatic language : "" FMs tasked w/ follow - up to expedite coop "" The account with more than 80,000 followers has not been officially verified to belong to Rouhani but is thought to be run by Rouhani 's aides .
A senior administration official confirmed that Rouhani 's Twitter feed had accurately reflected the tone of the conversation , and noted : "" We 'll be continuing to watch that Twitter account . ""
Twitter , like most major social media sites , is blocked in Iran ."
2013-09-28,"Hassan Rouhani returned to Tehran from New York on Saturday after his historic phone call with Barack Obama to a mixture of cheers from supporters and protests from hardliners who threw eggs and shoes at his car .
The reception greeting the Iranian president at Tehran airport reflected the precarious tightrope he will have to walk to do a deal with the west .
Ultra - conservative protesters chanted : "" Death to America "" and hurled invective and missiles at Rouhani 's car .
But his supporters outnumbered his opponents â€ “ estimated about 50-strong â€ “ and more importantly , the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , sent his closest foreign policy adviser to greet Rouhani .
The presence of Ali Akbar Velayati gave weight to Rouhani 's insistence that he had the highest authority to pursue his diplomatic initiative at the UN general assembly , which culminated in a groundbreaking 15-minute phone conversation with Obama on Friday , conducted on a mobile phone while Rouhani was on the way to John F Kennedy airport .
Iranian state television did not broadcast the hardliner protests at the airport , and the state news agency , Irna , instead played up the fact that the US had presented Rouhani with a 2,700 year - old Persian silver drinking vessel , shaped like a gryphon .
It had been seized from an art dealer who had smuggled it out of Iran in 2003 and the state department had been waiting for a thaw in relations in order to return it .
The majority of the official and semi - official Iranian press reports on Rouhani 's trip have been supportive or neutral .
Even Qassem Suleimani , the head of the Revolutionary Guards ' external operations wing , the Quds Force , a powerful figure in the security apparatus , had positive things to say about the visit .
Suleimani acknowledged the respect the world had shown to Rouhani , attributing it to the "" resistance and endurance "" of the nation .
However , the delicate nature of Rouhani 's position was also evident in the careful managing of the coverage of the New York trip .
Rouhani contradicted the White House account of his phone call with Obama stressing that the conversation had been an American idea . ""
Yesterday , at the moment we were preparing for moving towards the airport , the White House contacted us and expressed the willingness of the US president to have a phone conversation for some minutes , "" Rouhani told reporters at Tehran 's Mehrabad airport according to the Fars News Agency .
A number of tweets put out just after Friday 's phonecall by Rouhani 's official English - language Twitter account , reflecting the friendly and bantering tone of the conversation , were deleted a few hours later and replaced with a more formal , less detailed version .
Iranian officials have also sought to deny that Rouhani described the Holocaust as reprehensible in a CNN interview , even though the translation was provided by an official Iranian interpreter .
A senior member of parliament has even called for the news channel to be sued over the issue .
At a press conference before leaving New York , Rouhani had said the visit had exceeded his expectations , but his team is well aware of the resistance in Tehran that will have to be overcome in order to make the necessary compromises over the nuclear programme on secure an enduring settlement with the west .
A senior official in the Iranian delegation pointed out that hopes of detente with the west had been dashed before during the term of the last moderate president , Mohammad Khatami , as a result of ideological resistance in Tehran and the failure of the Bush administration to response positively to Iranian overtures in 2003 .
"" We have followed this path before and we know it does not necessarily end well , "" the official told the Guardian .
When it was suggested that there was more chance of a breakthrough now there were presidents in both Washington and Tehran who favoured diplomacy , the official replied : "" You need more than for the stars to be in alignment .
You need luck too . """
2013-09-28,"Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani held the first direct talks between American and Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution , exchanging pleasantries in a 15-minute telephone call on Friday that raised the prospect of relief for Tehran from crippling economic sanctions .
Speaking at the White House shortly after the historic call , Obama said his discussion with Rouhani had shown the "" basis for resolution "" of the dispute over Iran nuclear programme .
The conversation , in which Obama communicated his "" deep respect for the Iranian people "" , capped a week of diplomatic breakthroughs .
Rouhani ended a five - day visit to New York for the UN general assembly with a striking offer to work rapidly to defuse tensions with America , and hailed the US as "" a great nation "" – a dramatic shift in tone for an Iranian leader .
Both leaders expressed confidence their countries could reach a peaceful settlement to their standoff over Iranian nuclear programme .
Obama , in his White House statement , said : "" While there will be significant obstacles and success is by no means guaranteed , I believe we can reach a comprehensive solution .
I do believe that there is a basis for a resolution . ""
Obama cautioned against over - optimism , however .
"" We 're mindful of all the challenges ahead , "" he told reporters .
"" The test will be meaningful , transparent and verifiable actions which can also bring relief from the comprehensive international sanctions that are currently in place . ""
Minutes earlier , President Rouhani 's English - language Twitter account broke news of the phone call in a series of tweets that hinted at a remarkably swift rapprochement between the two countries since the moderate cleric was elected in June .
The tweets were deleted several hours later and replaced with more sombre versions .
One tweet said Rouhani had concluded the phone call by telling Obama to "" have a nice day ! ""
and Obama had thanked him and said goodbye in Persian – "" Khodahafez "" , which means "" God go with you "" .
That tweet was later deleted and replaced : The tweets , which were published by Rouhani 's aides , suggested the tone of the conversation was friendly , even punctuated by banter .

Rouhani rejected suggestions that his flexibility at the negotiating table was constrained by hardline forces back in Iran . ""
My government has full authority in these negotiations with support from all three arms of government as well as the people of Iran .
I have complete backing . ""
Nevertheless , in an indication of the precarious position in which Rouhani finds himself , the state news agency in Iran earlier this week disputed the translation of an interview he conducted with CNN .
In the interview , Rouhani acknowledged that the Holocaust took place .
CNN pointed out that the translator for the interview was provided by the Iranian government .
There were also suggestions that Obama and Rouhani might meet informally on the sidelines of the UN general assembly this week , but the prospect of a picture of the two leaders shaking hands appears to have been too much even for the new , moderate regime .
A telephone call , however , was more palatable .
According to the White House , the idea to hold the call came at short notice from the Rouhani team .
Having turned out the chance of a face - to - face meeting at the UN because it would be "" too complicated "" , Rouhani said he wanted to talk to Obama before he left for Iran .
The call took place at 2.30pm ET , it lasted about 15 minutes and was conducted through an interpreter .
A senior administration official confirmed that Rouhani 's Twitter feed had accurately reflected the tone of the conversation , and noted : "" We 'll be continuing to watch that Twitter account . ""
"" It was quite cordial in tone , "" the official said .
"" Both leaders expressed their determination to solve this [ nuclear ] issue expeditiously .
Both leaders expressed that sense of urgency .
"" The official said that the Israeli government and congressional leaders , both sources of resistance to a rapprochement between Washington and Tehran , had been alerted before the call began .
The official recalled that in his first inaugural address in January 2009 , Obama declared , in a phrase directly aimed at Tehran : "" We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . ""
The official added : "" What we are have seen here is a unclenching – hopefully – of that fist . ""
In his White House press conference , Obama acknowledged the historic nature of the call . ""
The very fact that this was the first communication between an American and Iranian president since 1979 underscores the deep mistrust between our countries but it also indicates the prospect of moving beyond that difficult history , "" he said .
Describing the sequence of events that led to the talks , Obama added : "" Iran 's supreme leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons .
Rouhani has indicated that Iran will never develop nuclear weapons .
I made clear that we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy . """
2013-09-28,"On Tuesday , President Obama gave his address to the UN general assembly , touching on Arab - Israeli peace , the crisis in Syria , the Iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons , and the need to stand together as an international community .
It followed on the heels of the address given by Hassan Rouhani , the new president of Iran .
Much has been said about both speeches and almost all commentary boils down to this :
diplomats never speak plainly , so what exactly did each president mean ?
Complaints about the opacity of diplomatic language predate the UN .
"" What a pity it is that diplomatic language , or lingo , is always , to say the least , so utterly unintelligible "" , an unnamed writer for the New York Times bemoaned in 1863 .
Famous French diplomat Charles de Talleyrand - PÃ
© rigord is said to have put it this way :
A diplomat who says ' yes ' means ' maybe ' , a diplomat who says ' maybe ' means ' no ' , and a diplomat who says ' no ' is no diplomat .
Talleyrand ( or someone putting words in Talleyrand 's mouth ) speaks the truth : the language of diplomacy is shaded in euphemism and hint .
The Egyptian regime change that occurred in July was emphatically not a military coup , according to the Obama administration .
Calling it a "" military coup "" would restrict US aid to Egypt and therefore be a diplomatic disaster ; but abandoning the democratically elected head of an allied government is also a diplomatic disaster .
How does one navigate this awkwardness ?
An unnamed senior Obama administration official charted the course : We will not say it was a coup , we will not say it was not a coup , we will just not say .
President Obama massaged the message a bit more this week at the UN : Morsi was democratically elected , but proved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was fully inclusive .
Talleyrand would approve .
The US is a comparative newbie on the diplomacy scene .
For centuries , diplomacy has been the province of the French .
France , or some iteration of it , has been a world power for almost a millennium , and French was both a courtly language as well as an international lingua franca .
And it shows in the language of diplomacy ; not only is modern French an official language of the UN , but French and its ancestors have given us the vocabulary of diplomacy .
As far back as the ninth century , Britain had dealings with Norman princes and kings , but in the 11th century most of Britain also became French .
William II of Normandy conquered the Anglo - Saxons in the Battle of Hastings , and all subsequent English kings were Frenchmen and subjects of France â€ “ even the famous Richard the Lionheart , who only spoke French dialects and spent most of his regency in the Duchy of Aquitaine .
In the years after the Battle of Hastings , England became a linguistic mishmash : the aristocracy spoke various dialects of French ; the average person on the street spoke only Anglo - Saxon ; and official records were generally kept in Latin .
It was the Norman middle management , essentially , who bridged the linguistic divide .
They developed their own lingua franca , a short - lived language that was based on Norman French and used in lesser official documents , in the lower courts , and anywhere where French gentry mixed with upwardly mobile Anglo - Saxons .
This language , called Anglo - French or Anglo - Norman and used as a language of cultural negotiation , gave English many words having to do with administration and diplomacy : "" treaty "" , "" ratify "" , "" ally "" and its relative , "" allegiance "" , "" ambassador "" , and "" broker "" ( as in , "" peace brokers "" ) all derive from Anglo - French .
The influence of French words in diplomacy waned slightly in the 17th and 18th centuries , but the 19th century brought a new influx of Francophonic words into the English diplomatic vernacular , as the upstart colonies in America declared independence and signed a treaty of alliance with France .
France 's own attempts at diplomatie ( the root of our modern English word diplomacy ) with its populace and with other nations failed , and the America - France - Britain situation became the focus of politicians for decades after .
Francophone political words poured into English , including "" federalize "" , "" secretariat "" , "" insurgency "" , and â€ “ tellingly â€ “ "" bureaucracy "" .
Though in a different register , politicians have employed less - than - straightforward language since the dawn of recorded time .
In 46 BC , Cicero noted that : Rhetoricians are permitted to lie about historical matters so they can speak more nimbly .
The politicians of the new United States took to this habit like ducks to water .
George Washington wrote to Virginia 's acting governor in 1758 , trying to convince him to establish trade with the local Native American tribes for the good of "" firm and lasting peace "" .
Also in 1758 , James Madison noted that rulers who overstepped the rights of individuals "" exceed the commission from which they derive their authority , and are tyrants "" .
"" Tyrant "" was used three times in Obama 's address to the UN on Tuesday , and his initial sentiment harkens back to Madison : For most of recorded history , individual aspirations were subject to the whims of tyrants and empires .
President Obama finished his speech by saying : We are ready to meet tomorrow 's challenges with you â€ “ firm in the belief that all men and women are , in fact , created equal , each individual possessed with a dignity that can not be denied .
That 's a paraphrase of the famous passage from the Declaration of Independence .
Mark Lyall Grant , British ambassador to the UN and skilful diplomat that is he , did n't bat an eyelid ."
2013-09-29,"The Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , vowed to "" tell the truth "" about Iran 's nuclear programme as he flew to the US on Sunday to meet Barack Obama and address the United Nations .
A diplomatic offensive at the UN last week by Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , who had a historic 15-minute phone conversation with Obama on Friday , has raised concerns in Israel , which fears improving relations between the US , one of its closest allies , and Iran , one of its worst enemies .
There is concern that if the US eases economic sanctions and removes any military threat , Tehran would be freer to create a nuclear bomb .
Officials say Netanyahu will present evidence of continued Iranian efforts to attain a nuclear weapon , and will urge the US and others not to be taken in by Rouhani 's charm offensive.""I will tell the truth in the face of the sweet talk and offensive of smiles , "" Netanyahu said on Saturday night before boarding his plane to New York .
"" One must talk facts and tell the truth .
Telling the truth today is vital for the security and peace of the world and , of course , it is vital for the security of our country .
"" As Netanyahu travelled to the US , Israel 's Shin Bet domestic security agency announced it had arrested an Iranian with Belgian nationality who was suspected of spying for Tehran .
The agency said Ali Mansouri , 58 , carried photos of the US embassy in Tel Aviv and had been promised $ 1 m ( £ 620,000 ) to set up companies in Israel on behalf of the Iranian intelligence services "" to harm Israeli and western interests "" .
Israeli commentators said Netanyahu would have to work hard to offset the impression left by Rouhani in his UN speech and media appearances , where he presented himself as a peace - seeking moderate . ""
The Iranian president was very successful in convincing many in the US who want to be convinced that there is a new spirit in Tehran and a great willingness now for compromise .
It will be an enormous challenge for Netanyahu to reverse that trend , "" said Jonathan Spyer , a senior research fellow at the Interdisciplinary Centre in Herzliya .
In the Yediot Ahronot newspaper , prominent columnist Nahum Barnea wrote that , in his phone conversation with Rouhani , Obama had "" folded the flag which Netanyahu had waved to Israelis and the world , the basis of his diplomatic existence "" .
Barnea added : "" The threat of a military attack by the US has been removed , at least in the coming months , and it is doubtful if there ever was an Israeli military threat . ""
Netanyahu has argued for increased sanctions on Iran , backed by a "" credible military threat "" that he said proved itself in the case of Syria , which under threat of a US strike agreed to international control of its chemical weapons .
The Israeli leader has urged that Iran be pressed to halt all uranium enrichment , remove enriched uranium from the country , dismantle the Fordo nuclear plant and stop "" the plutonium track "" to a nuclear weapon .
Yossi Alpher , an Israeli strategic analyst , said that Netanyahu 's "" strident tone "" , which included ordering the Israeli UN delegation to walk out of Rouhani 's speech , meant that "" he 's coming across as a kind of spoiler "" .
"" I do n't think he will be able to persuasively argue that Rouhani is not worth talking to , "" Alpher said .
"" We lose a degree of credibility when we allow ourselves to be totally out of synch with our allies on this issue . """

Michael Herzog might well be asked : why ca n't Iran and most of Israel 's neighbours trust the Tel Aviv regime ?
Doubtless , were the UN to impose on Israel the kind of sanctions levied on Iran , forcing the regime to comply with international law , we would see a speedy , just resolution to the 65 years of oppression suffered by the Palestinian people .

With Iran , it 's not really about nuclear weapons at all .
It 's about the hawks in Israel and the US needing a suitable enemy to justify their belligerence .
Rouhani does n't fit the bill – they 'd rather have Ahmadinejad .
Peter Adams Stroud , Gloucestershire • Simon Jenkins ( If we fear an Iranian bomb , we should back
Rouhani , 27 September ) rightly questions the effectiveness of sanctions , but he misses the irony of what has happened with Iran . ""
Targeted sanctions "" were devised in the late 1990s as a response to the manifest failures of traditional , broad - based economic sanctions .
In 2006 this new approach was adopted to put pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme .
The original aim was to focus economic pressure on key individuals and entities , but avoid causing extensive collateral damage to the general population .
However , having failed to achieve anything , the sanctions regime has been successively "" toughened "" ( ie expanded ) .
The result is the sort of broad - based economic blockade that everyone agreed long ago to be a bad idea .
It would seem that as far as sanctions are concerned what goes around comes around .

It is difficult to disagree with the logic of Simon Jenkins , but he has overlooked a political dynamic .
He says "" Israel 's boycott of Iran 's hand of friendship is madness "" .
Not so .
The "" existential threat "" reinforces US support for Israel and its hostility towards Iran .
This leverage is too important to give away .
And Israel has probably calculated that a rapprochement led by Obama can be defeated in Congress , especially with its help .
To break this dynamic , Britain and Europe need to show willingness to pursue rapprochement without , if need be , the US .

2013-10-01,"The Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , launched a sustained attack on the new Iranian president Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday , deriding his recent charm offensive with western leaders as a "" ruse and a ploy "" that was designed to fool the international community into dropping its guard against Iran 's development of nuclear weapons .
At the end of a week of intense diplomacy at the UN compound in New York in which the overriding focus has been the growing hope of meaningful negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme , Netanyahu sounded a starkly conflicting note in his address to the UN general assembly .
He pounded the Iranian regime and its newly elected president , accusing them of sponsoring terrorism and lying repeatedly over their nuclear weapons ambitions , and exhorting the rest of the world not to be hoodwinked into lifting sanctions on Tehran .
Rouhani 's strategy , he said , was to "" smile a lot because smiling never hurts ; pay lip - service to peace , democracy and tolerance ; offer meaningless concessions in exchange for lifting sanctions ; ensure Iran retains sufficient nuclear material and infrastructure to race to the bomb at a time that it chooses . ""
He went on : "" You know why Rouhani thinks he can get away with this ?
This is a ruse , a ploy .
Because he 's gotten away with it before .
He fooled the world once , now he thinks he can fool it again .
He thinks he can have his yellow cake and eat it too . ""
Israel has been watching the green shoots of improving relations between Iran and the US with growing alarm .
Signs of a changing direction were capped by the 15-minute historic phone conversation between presidents Obama and Rouhani last week .
A year ago , Netanyahu stood at the same podium at the UN general assembly and presented a cartoon - like representation of a Iranian nuclear bomb , with a red line drawn near its peak .
At that time , talk of a possible unilateral Israeli air strike on Iran was a dominant subject of diplomatic conversation .
Now Israel is in danger of being sidelined by the rapidly moving sense of detente between the new Iranian government , the US and other western countries .
Netanyahu used his UN address , the final speech of the 2013 general assembly , to try and regain some of the initiative and disabuse his fellow leaders of what he considers their mistaken trust in Iran 's intentions .
Since Rouhani 's election as president , he said , Iran has continued unabated its "" vast and feverish effort "" to develop the capability to produce an atomic bomb .
Last year alone the country had enriched three tonnes of uranium to 20 % and added thousands of nuclear centrifuges , including advanced ones .
"" It 's not hard to find evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons programme , it 's hard to find evidence that it does n't have a nuclear weapons programme , "" he said .
Netanyahu said the only way to prevent Iran from pressing ahead with its ambitions for the bomb was to maintain , and even strengthen , the international sanctions that are now biting deeply into the Iranian economy .
Sanctions should only be lifted after Iran had ceased all uranium enrichment , removed from its territory its stockpiles of already enriched material , close its Fordo enrichment facility and discontinue its heavy water facility in Arak .
Netanyahu 's uncompromising speech , in which he portrayed Rouhani as a "" loyal servant "" of the supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei , underlines the delicate path that President Obama must travel in the pursuit of negotiations with Tehran .
He has made clear that he wishes to pursue the hope of meaningful talks with the new Iranian government , but is also aware that he must not alienate the Israeli government in the process .
When Obama met Netanyahu in the White House on Monday , he said that he was "" very clear - eyed "" about the chance of negotiations with Rouhani .
Netanyahu told Obama in return that Iran was committed to Israel 's destruction and only a full dismantling of its military nuclear programme would suffice .
Netanyahu went further in front of the UN on Tuesday , making explicit the threat that underpins the Israeli position : "" Israel will never acquiesce to nuclear weapons in the hands of a rogue regime that persistently threatens to wipe us off the map .
If Israel is forced to stand alone , Israel will stand alone .
"" The Israeli prime minister devoted barely a few minutes of his speech on the renewed talks with the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in the search for peace in the Middle East .
He said Israel was still committed to seeking "" an historic compromise with our Palestinian neighbours "" .
But he said it would only happen if the Palestinians "" fully recognise the Jewish state , and Israel 's security needs must be met .
I am prepared to make an historic compromise for an enduring and genuine peace , but I will never compromise the security of my people . """
2013-10-01,"Hossein Shariatmadari , the chief editor of Iran 's leading hardline newspaper , appears to be in quite a quandary .
Long Kayhan 's primary editorial writer , he kept silent for weeks as Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , and his diplomatic team made a series of statements and gestures indicating their willingness to engage in substantive negotiations with the United States and its western allies .
Then came the historic telephone exchange last week between Rouhani and Barack Obama , the first direct contact between the presidents of the Islamic republic of Iran and the United States since the 1979 revolution and the takeover of the US embassy in Tehran .
On Sunday , Shariatmadari , faced with a choice between continued silence and condemnation , picked the latter . ""
The last act of the New York trip , which should be considered most disheartening , and the largest advantage that our nation 's respectful president handed [ our ] opponent , was the phone conversation of his with the president of the US "" , he said of Rouhani 's visit to address the UN General Assembly .
Rather than deal with the content of the conversation , Shariatmadari focused on the announcement by US national security advisor Susan Rice that the Iranian delegation had requested the call . ""
Based on what analysis and interpretation did his eminence , Mr Rouhani , and the meritorious entourage feel it necessary to trust the Americans and then present the United States ' trust - building efforts in such expansive and loud propaganda as one of the fruits of the New York trip ?
Furthermore , what kind of a ' trust - building step ' is this , which neither side is willing to take responsibility for [ initiating ] ? ""
"" Just take a look at the volume of reviews , analyses , and reports published by the American media , and by American and Zionist officials to see how they reframe the aforementioned telephone conversation in terms of the ' capitulation of Islamic Iran ' and its weakness and despair due to the strain of the sanctions "" , he wrote , without naming any specific media outlets .
Discussing the Kayhan editorial , a senior editor at an Iranian reformist publication told Tehran Bureau , "" Shariatmadari is considered an icon in the principlist media realm .
For about 20 years , his has been the first and last words among right - wing publications , and his first and last words have always been that under no circumstances should we negotiate with the United States . ""
Undoubtedly , Rouhani did not converse with Obama without the consent of [ supreme leader Ayatollah Ali ] Khamenei .
This has put Shariatmadari in a frightful predicament . ""
The depth of that predicament was brought into clearer focus when the state - controlled Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting , long a source of hardline views essentially identical to Kayhan 's , offered a very different perspective on the presidential phone call to its millions of viewers .
In its Channel One news programming on Saturday , IRIB presented wall - to - wall coverage of Rouhani and his youthful entourage 's return to Iran .
Even as it censored out any coverage of the protesters , including Basij militia members , who chanted anti - Rouhani slogans at the airport , the network 's reporters roamed the streets of Tehran asking apparently typical citizens for their opinions of the 15-minute conversation between Iran 's president and that of the nation which for years it had called "" the Great Satan "" .
Every single one of the people whose interviews were aired welcomed the event .
Massoud , a 25-year - old pharmacist , saw that part of the broadcast at the drugstore where he works .
"" It was unbelievable .
IRIB , since I can remember , only broadcast interviews with people in anti - American demonstrations where they would say that the US was the people 's enemy , and should not be negotiated with .
The IRIB would repeatedly broadcast this same refrain from people 's mouths : ' our martyrs ' have given their blood , which would be desecrated under foot if we ever negotiated with America . ""
"" I could not have dreamt that the Iranian news would broadcast the voice of real people who would say , on camera , that our president has conversed with America "" , he continued .
"" To see such a thing on IRIB was just as shocking as the actual news of Rouhani 's conversation with Obama . ""
In addition , IRIB featured an analyst who , far from criticising Rouhani 's decision to converse with Obama , argued that Iran was now dealing with the United States from a position of strength .
Speaking on condition of anonymity , a political analyst told Tehran Bureau , "" IRIB demonstrated how completely it acknowledges Khamenei 's approval of the recent historic conversation .
[ Network chief Ezzatollah ]
Zarghami has gotten the message that Rouhani spoke with Obama by Khamenei 's permission , ... interpreted it as the leader 's decision , and quickly showed he is amenable to it . ""
If IRIB knew that Rouhani had done this on his own , it would have deployed all its reportage and analysis against the people 's elected president . ""
The moderate - right Islamic Republic daily , which is under Khamenei 's nominal directorship , ran an op - ed titled "" Negotiation 's Do 's and Don'ts "" that similarly offered no criticism of Rouhani for establishing contact with the US president .
The author , Soroush Sahebfossul , did remind readers , "" American people 's views , right or wrong , are interlaced with the occupation of their embassy in Iran .
[ And ] although the world of diplomacy is a world of cost / benefit analysis and decisions based on national interests , it would be simplistic to imagine that just a few negotiation sessions ... will result in normalisation of the two nations ' relationship . ""
Sahebfossul also cautioned against "" getting exuberant "" over the presidential phone call and emphasized that Iran 's economic difficulties are due not so much to the lack of a relationship with the US , "" but are more the result of mismanagement , profiteering , structural weakness of the central political core in its supervision of the governments ' execution of [ economic ] policies , placing rent as the governments ' [ economic ] foundation , making it dependent on oil income , and the minuscule share of taxes in the nation 's budget . ""
By contrast , in an unsigned editorial the conservative Raja News website took direct aim at Rouhani for daring to speak to his American counterpart : "" Putting aside the glaring error by the president in this attempt , and the lack of respect for the deep theoretical foundations erected by the late Imam [ Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ] with regards to dealing with the Great Satan , this venture has no benefit for Iran in any economic or rational calculus either . ...
This strange and doubtful behaviour on part of the president has occurred in a situation where it will produce no tangible diplomatic outcome for ' revolutionary Iran . ""
Declaring it especially distasteful that the contact took place during the week in which the "" holy defence "" is celebrated â€ “ commemorating the start of Iran 's eight - year war with Iraq â€ “ the editorial concluded that there was no clear justification for "" frittering away Iran 's most treasured national asset , that is , its cutting sword of resistance . ""
According to a reformist activist who is a member of the banned Participation Front , Raja News reflects the views of the Iranian regime 's most hardline faction and its "" aggression , outlaw behaviour , and extra - legal conduct .
"" Observing the website 's "" vehement "" support for the positions espoused by influential ultra - conservative cleric Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi , he told Tehran Bureau , "" In the last eight years it defended the deranged acts of Ahmadinejad , from denial of the Holocaust to the violent suppression of the Green Movement and belligerence toward the west .
This faction 's preferred candidate [ in June 's presidential election ] , similarly deranged , was Saeed Jalili , a man who said that he did n't welcome any policy reducing tensions with the west , and that his words were those of the leader . ""
"" There are two reasons that Raja News has attacked Rouhani with such fervour "" , the activist said .
"" First , Rouhani has broken this faction 's taboos , and second , they hold a deep grudge over Jalili 's crushing defeat in the presidential race at the hands of Rouhani , who garnered 18 million votes , while Jalili received barely 4 million .
It will be a while before their anger toward Rouhani subsides .
The issue is not just negotiations with the US .
The problem is that the one who has commenced the negotiations is the same one who profoundly humiliated this faction . """
2013-10-01,"Guest blog : Wyn Bowen and Matthew Moran of King 's College London argue that the balance of power in Iran offers an opportunity for a nuclear deal
In recent years , Iran 's refusal to address concerns over its nuclear programme has left the Islamic Republic increasingly isolated on the international stage .
Wide - ranging sanctions are crippling the country 's economy , and the threat of a military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities continues to loom on the horizon .
In this context , the surprise election of Hassan Rouhani as president in June has infused the Iranian nuclear issue with a new , albeit cautious , sense of optimism .
A centrist politician with a taste for pragmatism , Rouhani appears to have made re - engagement with the international community a priority .
Since his election , the new president has emphasised his goal of reducing tensions with Western powers and , in a much anticipated speech at the UN , he declared Tehran 's willingness to ' remove any and all reasonable concerns about Iran 's peaceful nuclear program ' .
After almost a decade of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's politics of defiance , the new president 's conciliatory tone points towards a new era in Iran 's international relations .
Rouhani 's overtures have been welcomed by Western leaders and in his own speech at the UN , President Obama said there is now ' the basis for a meaningful agreement ' with Iran , suggesting a renewed diplomatic effort to resolve the nuclear challenge .
The logic behind Rouhani 's approach is clear : with a mandate for change and a reputation as a moderate , Iran 's new president has a unique opportunity to ease international pressure on the country .
The real question however , is what can we realistically expect to change ?
How far will Rouhani go in his efforts to resolve the nuclear issue ?
And , more importantly , how far can he go when ultimately it is Supreme Leader Khamanei who takes the final decision on issues of foreign policy and national security ?
When Iran 's undeclared nuclear activities were revealed in 2002 , the Iranian programme was propelled to the top of the international agenda .
Perhaps more importantly , the nuclear programme , previously the preserve of an elite group of decision - makers , was thrust into the domestic arena and opened up to broader political scrutiny for the first time in Iran .
In this context , and whatever its aspirations , the regime was forced to fully engage with a peaceful nuclear narrative at the domestic level to secure necessary political support in a notoriously factional environment .
Accusations of weapons aspirations were dismissed as the leadership in Tehran stressed that the Iranian nuclear programme was purely for civil purposes .
The impact of this development was enormous , effectively creating significant domestic barriers to the bomb since the Iranian regime was no longer able to move forward with the nuclear programme in as covert a manner as it did pre-2002 .
In Iran there has long been a strong consensus around the need to advance the nuclear energy programme
â€ “ mastery of this expensive and technically demanding technology is associated with national advancement and modernity .
However , there is no such agreement on nuclear weapons and deviating from the peaceful narrative would be a high - risk strategy for any leader .
Furthermore , as international opposition to Iran 's nuclear advancement increased , the debate around the nuclear programme became one of Iranian rights and sovereignty .
The nuclear issue emerged as a rallying point for Iranian nationalism and a potent source of support for the regime .
It was not by chance that Ahmadinejad made defiance on the nuclear issue the cornerstone of his presidency .
But investing the nuclear issue with such political and symbolic significance has had important consequences .
The nuclear programme has gained an organic momentum that has constrained the regime 's room for diplomatic manoeuvre .
This is not to suggest that Iran 's nuclear trajectory has outstripped the regime 's intentions or aspirations .
There is considerable evidence that Iran 's nuclear activities extend beyond what is necessary for a civil programme .
Indeed there is a widely held perception that with respect to nuclear weapons Tehran is , to quote Churchill , pursuing ' the art rather than the article ' .
In other words , many observers believe that Iran is hedging its bets ; attempting to acquire the wherewithal to be capable of manufacturing nuclear weapons but without actually crossing the threshold - at least not until some perceived security imperative prompts a political decision to do so .
In a general sense , this interpretation appears to be accurate .
Iran is moving ever - closer to a weapons capability in line with a strategy that appears to be based on hedging .
Crucially , however , Iran 's behaviour is a very particular form of hedging shaped primarily by domestic politics .
In fact , the evidence suggests that Tehran 's hedging approach has developed as much through domestic political circumstance as it has through a grand strategic design .
So what does this mean in the context of President Rouhani 's diplomatic overtures ?
Is there hope for a mutually acceptable solution to the nuclear issue ?
If there is to be a diplomatic agreement it must be based on realistic and achievable goals .
Given the significance of the nuclear issue in Iran , and the developed state of the programme , it is not feasible to expect decision - makers in Tehran to risk the domestic political backlash of agreeing to a significant roll back of its existing capability .
Iran certainly will not agree to give up enrichment because this is a core part of the domestic narrative with .
The leadership in Tehran has consistently emphasised the country 's ' right ' under the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty to pursue peaceful development of nuclear energy - related capabilities .
A more realistic goal is to focus on containing Iranian technical advancements and placing limits on further progress .
Such an approach will entail an implicit acceptance of Iran 's particular form of hedging and this will not , of course , be palatable to all parties , particularly Israel .
But to expect anything else may be overly optimistic given the domestic political constraints around which President Rouhani must navigate .
Of course , the limits of containment are open to debate and there are a number of key issues to be considered , from enrichment levels to stocks of fissile material .
In principle , however , this would involve keeping Iran some way away from a credible breakout capability , but at the same time allowing Tehran to retain its programme in some form .
The trade - off here would need to include limiting the enrichment programme to the 3 - 5 % enriched uranium relevant to the production of fuel for power reactors ; recognising , of course , that Iran has already enriched to 20 % and this has contributed significantly to widespread concern over intentions in the weapons area , where around 90 % is required .
Iran is likely to come under pressure to close its Fordow facility in order to consolidate all enrichment activities on the one site at Natanz .
Moreover , Iran will certainly be expected to be more transparent and agree to increased oversight of its nuclear activities .
The Iranian Parliament would , for example , have to ratify and fully implement the Additional Protocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement , with IAEA inspectors being provided with all necessary access and support to verify declared activities and rule out any further undeclared work .
For the Iranian leadership to make such concessions on the nuclear programme , it will need to be able to sell the overall package as a ' win ' for Iranian diplomacy .
Allowing Rouhani and his colleagues to save face in this respect is important because the nuclear programme enjoys support across the political spectrum in Iran , and past experience has shown that any move that might be perceived as a loss is sure to invite political attack .
In this context , Rouhani can only go so far without losing political credibility at home , so the international community will need to show flexibility .
But this approach need not be a ' loss ' for western powers .
The diplomatic back and forth of recent years has achieved no concrete results .
The Iranian programme has marched on and Tehran moves ever closer to the bomb .
A continuation along this path is likely to result in military action because Israel is unlikely to stand by and watch Iran approach the nuclear weapons threshold .
So , by recognising the complexity of the situation , and taking steps to contain Iran 's nuclear programme rather than seeking rollback , the international community has an opportunity to achieve a realistic solution to the Iranian nuclear challenge .
Some will argue that such an approach rewards bad behaviour , but the reality is , the window for negotiating with Iranian moderates will not remain open for long if the outside world fails to act pragmatically on the nuclear issue .

2013-10-02,"Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , has reassured Twitter 's co - founder , Jack Dorsey , that he will work to make sure Iranians have access to information globally in what appears to be a reference to reducing online censorship .
Dorsey started the conversation on Tuesday , asking the internet - savvy leader if people of his country could read tweets posted by their own president , implicitly referring to the filtering of social networking websites in the Islamic republic .
Twitter and Facebook are among at least 5 million sites blocked in Iran . ""
Good evening , President .
Are citizens of Iran able to read your tweets ? ""
Dorsey posted on his Twitter account , @jack , which is followed by nearly 2.5 million people .
Within hours , Rouhani replied , saying : "" Evening , @Jack .
As I told @camanpour , my efforts geared 2 ensure my ppl'll comfortably b able 2 access all info globally as is their # right . ""
The Iranian president was referring to his interview with CNN 's Christiane Amanpour in which he pledged to deliver his election campaign promises in regards to people 's access to internet .
Rouhani , who has maintained an active social presence since campaigning for office , has taken a softer line on web censorship , describing social networking sites such as Facebook as a welcome phenomenon .
Rouhani 's twitter account is believed to be run by a close associate .
Asked by Amanpour if he would work to reduce censorship in Iran , he replied : "" All my efforts are geared to ensure that the people of Iran will comfortably be able to access all information globally and to use it .
There are large social networks at a global level around today .
And I believe that all human beings have a right , and all nations have a right to use them . ""
In a public challenge to filtering in the Islamic republic , Rouhani 's administration has embraced social networks , particularly the foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , who has engaged with his followers on Twitter , @jzarif , as well as on his Facebook page .
In his CNN interview , Rouhani , without referring to filtering , said countries might have ethical and moral concerns and might adhere to a framework .
"" One of my plans is to reduce the problems that people face currently on these issues , so that within those sort of moral frameworks that we have for ourselves , that we are able to access these social network sites , "" he said .
In response to Rouhani 's tweet , Dorsey posted : "" thank you .
Please let us know how we can help to make it a reality . ""
Rouhani does not have full authority to rescind filtering alone as such decisions rests in the hands of the country 's internet big brother , the supreme council on cyberspace , which was set up last year at the request of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , to police the activities of Iranians online .
Rouhani chairs the council but does not have the final say as it also includes members of other institutions including parliament and the elite Revolutionary Guards .
However , since Rouhani was sworn in to office in August , Iranians have reported an improvement in the speed of internet and a relative relaxation of restrictions .

Rouhani has been broadly praised at home for his UN visit while hawkish hardliners have largely held back from criticism because the president is assumed to have the backing of Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , for the overture with the US .
Iran 's conservative - dominated parliament also endorsed the president 's visit , local agencies said on Wednesday , reporting that the speaker , Ali Larijani , had praised the president on the visit .
Ebtekar , who is the head of Iran 's environmental protection organisation , said the standoff between Tehran and the west over Iran 's nuclear programme and the Syrian conflict are two contemporary challenges that need to be addressed urgently .
But she warned that the Tehran - Washington rapprochement , which has increased hopes for a breakthrough , would not bear fruit unless the US showed consistency in its words and actions . ""
President Obama also indicated that the US does not seek regime change in Tehran and that the two countries can have a different , more open relationship after the dispute is settled , "" she writes . ""
While the US seems ready to reciprocate , many observers question whether all the elements of the US administration are pulling in the same direction and whether there will be practical confidence - building measures in the near future to consolidate the fruits of this visit . ""
Ebtekar 's warning comes after Obama reassured Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , that the military option against Tehran has not been taken off the table .
There is also scepticism whether Obama can reciprocate any Iranian compromise in the face of fierce resistance from Congress .
Following Obama 's conversation with Netanyahu earlier this week , Iran 's foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , tweeted on Tuesday that the US needed a consistent policy with Iran . ""
President Obama needs consistency to promote mutual confidence .
Flip flop destroys trust and undermines US credibility , "" he said .
In her article , Ebtekar recalls previous missed opportunities to improve US - Iran relations under the reformist administration of Mohammad Khatami between 1997 to 2005 .
She urged the west to seize the opportunity created by Rouhani , whom she said has unrestricted mandate to resolve the dispute over Iran 's nuclear activities . ""
In 1998 , when President Khatami came to the UN with the novel approach of dialogue among civilisations , he faced an unrelenting storm of internal pressure while the US president branded Iran a member of the axis of evil , thus neutralising his excellent initiative at both the domestic and global levels , "" she recalls .
"" With the passage of 15 years and the loss of millions of lives in global wars , perhaps we have all learned our lesson and global leaders are more prepared to say no to militarism , terrorism , nuclear arsenals and extremism . ""
Ebtekar , 53 , spent at least six years of her childhood in the US but later became involved in Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution .
Because of her English - language skills , she became a spokeswoman for the students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days .
At the time she was nicknamed Mary .
She later sided with the reformists and under Khatami was appointed the Islamic republic 's first female vice - president .
Ebtekar was marginalised under Ahmadinejad and came under fire in the aftermath of the disputed 2009 election when she visited victims of the popular uprising .
In her article , Ebtekar says Rouhani 's election has raised hopes for an internal opening towards political prisoners , many of whom were arrested in 2009 .
"" There has been gradual release of political prisoners who were detained on grounds of opposition to the results of the controversial elections of 2009 , "" she writes .
"" This demonstrates a unified and genuine effort on behalf of Iran to change the political atmosphere while adhering to the basic precepts and principles of the Islamic Republic and the inalienable right of Iran to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes . ""
Prior to Rouhani 's visit to New York , local agencies said Khamenei had declared amnesty for 80 political prisoners , boosting the president 's credibility but activists have been so far unable to fully identify them .
Despite Ebtekar 's comments , there is confusion in Tehran whether Rouhani 's decision to speak to Obama was made with or without Khamenei 's knowledge .
This was reinforced when the commander of the elite revolutionary guards , the shock troopers of Iranian power , said earlier in the week that he approved the president 's manoeuvres in New York but considered his conversation with Obama premature .
Conservative media , including the Kayhan newspaper , have also shown dissatisfaction with the phone call ."
2013-10-03,"Negotiations over Iran 's nuclear program could be undermined by a reluctance on the part of the US Congress to relax a complex network of economic sanctions , according to experts and diplomats monitoring forthcoming talks in Geneva .
Meetings between Iran and six leading powers are scheduled to begin in Switzerland in two weeks , following a sustained effort on the part of Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , to mend relations with the west and secure a deal that would ease debilitating sanctions .
On Thursday , Wendy Sherman , the US under - secretary of state for political affairs , said Iran could expect some limited relief from sanctions if it took confidence - building steps to allay concerns about its nuclear ambitions .
However , the vast network of overlapping US sanctions , which have built up over three decades , can not be easily unpicked by the Obama administration without the support of both houses of Congress .
"" If – and it is a big ' if ' – the president needs to use an easing of sanctions to provide incentive to the Iranians , or to acknowledge a gesture on their part , our feeling is : it will be very difficult for the administration to deliver that , "" one senior European diplomat said .
Hawks in the House of Representatives in particular are in no mood to compromise .
Two months ago , with bipartisan support , the House passed a bill to tighten the economic noose on Iran .
The Guardian has obtained a copy of a second draft bill that goes further : approving the use of military force to deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons .
The bill states that the US would be "" wholly capable , willing and ready to use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining or developing a nuclear weapons capability "" and offers "" consent "" to the president should he wish to take action .
Trent Franks , the conservative congressman behind the bill , told the Guardian that it was designed to strengthen the president 's hand during talks and "" inject into the discussion the importance of Mr Obama not making a bad deal – because a bad deal is worse than no deal at all "" .
Giving evidence before a Senate committee on Thursday , Sherman urged lawmakers to hold off on imposing more sanctions before a meeting with Iranian officials in Geneva on 15 and 16 October .
The UK , Germany , France , Russia and China will all participate in the talks , but it is accepted the most important negotiations will be bilateral meetings between Iran 's delegation and the US .
Technical experts from all six countries are meeting in the coming days , as a prelude to the talks .
Ramin Asgard , a consultant who previously ran the State Department 's Iran desk in Dubai –
the US government 's primary field office monitoring Tehran – said "" a major transformation "" would be required on Capitol Hill , which has "" gotten used to the narrative of Iran being this threat and negative actor "" .
It would require a "" sea change "" in congressional attitudes to get a deal through , he said .
The basic contours of an agreement are expected to involve Iran opening up to rigorous inspections , destroying stockpiles of 2 % enriched uranium and committing to a civilian nuclear program , in return for sanctions relief , although Iran has indicated it may have new proposals .
An early barometer of how serious Iran is , is likely to occur prior to the official meeting in Geneva , when the foreign minister , Javad Zarif , is expected to circulate formal ideas that will form the start of talks .
"" I hope they present us with some ideas in advance of that so that when we sit down to work we 're not beginning without some grist to the mill , "" a senior State Department official said .
Any deal over Iran 's nuclear program would be months or even years away , but it would likely be contingent upon the Obama administration selling an Iranian deal to Congress .
With EU sanctions closely bound with those imposed by the US , and international companies unlikely to do business with Iran unless permitted to do so by all major powers , other countries will be heavily dependent upon developments in Washington , diplomats say .
Suzanne Maloney , senior fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy , at the Brookings Institution thinktank , said US Treasury officials , who have spent years trying to find ways to better enforce sanctions , are scrambling to consider how they might quickly alleviate those restrictions if negotiations with Iran go well .
"" Even early progress , even minor steps , will require an enormous amount of work on the part of the administration – work that , as far as I 'm told , has not yet been prepared . ""
Maloney and other officials indicated that the administration does have some room for manoeuvre , particularly under presidential waiver authority , but a final deal would almost certainly need congressional backing .
Another diplomatic source said the US administration had control over "" significant enough portions "" of the sanctions to incentivise the Iranian side .
"" If they feel they need to offer something , they can – and they can act on it , "" the source said .
"" Congress will choose how to handle the sanctions it has put in place . ""
The State Department 's deputy spokeswoman , Marie Harf , said this week that Iran 's desire to improve the economic situation in the country was at the heart of the nuclear talks . ""
Obviously , sanctions play into that , and we 'll keep working with Congress on the best way to do all of this going forward , "" she said .
However , it is not clear whether Congress – and in particular hardline Republicans currently calling the shots in the House – will back any final deal , particularly within the timeframe of six months being mooted by Iran .
The bill that passed the House at the end of July , the Nuclear Iran Prevention Act 2013 , which proposes a dramatic tightening of sanctions , is now with the Senate .
One provision seeks to reduce Iran 's exports of oil by a further million barrels a day which , if current estimates of its oil sales are believed , would reduce its exports to near zero .
It is currently being held at the Senate banking committee , apparently out of consideration for the forthcoming talks , but would "" probably get through tomorrow "" if it was put to a wider vote , Maloney said .
The author of the bill , Ed Royce , the Republican chairman of the foreign affairs committee , responded to Iran 's diplomatic offensive at the United Nations last week by saying that Congress should "" double down "" on sanctions .
Trent Franks plans to introduce his new bill approving of military force against Iran through the same committee next week .
Catherine Ashton , the EU foreign policy chief , made clear on Monday she would prefer the US not impose additional sanctions before the nuclear talks .
"" I would like to get to Geneva with the best possible atmosphere to really have these negotiations , "" she said .
This week 's government shutdown underscored the influence wielded by conservatives in the Republican - dominated House , and the stronghold rightwingers have over the Republican speaker of the House , John Boehner .
Franks said that he and others in the Tea Party caucus would be inclined to disbelieve any Iranian promises made during negotiations – and would not be easily persuaded of the need to lift or even ease sanctions on Iran any time soon .
"" I do n't think we would be very amenable , "" he said .
"" I think Speaker Boehner understands the gravity of the situation . """
2013-10-05,"The supreme leader of Iran , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has told the country 's president said that some of his diplomatic moves made towards the United States were "" not appropriate "" , but reiterated his support for the new policy of outreach to the west .
President Hassan Rouhani was greeted with both cheers and eggs when he returned to Tehran from New York , where he had a 15-minute phone conversation with US president Barack Obama – a landmark development in thawing relations between the two countries .
Hardliners within Iran , including commanders in the revolutionary guard , said the president went too far in reaching out to the US .
Commenting on his website khamenei.ir , the ayatollah said the US was "" untrustworthy "" .
"" We support the government 's diplomatic moves including the New York trip because we have faith [ in them ] , "" he said .
"" But some of what happened in the New York trip was not appropriate .
We are sceptical of Americans and have no trust in them at all .
The American government is untrustworthy , arrogant , illogical and a promise - breaker .
It 's a government captured by the international Zionism network . ""
The move by the president has been met with support by Iranian legislators although factions have become wary at the pace of developments .
The revolutionary guard 's chief commander , Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari , praised Rouhani recently but called the phone call a "" tactical mistake "" and said he should have avoided it . ""
The respected president , who adopted a powerful and appropriate position in the trip … would have been better off avoiding the telephone conversation with Obama in the same way he did n't give time for a meeting with Obama and left such measures until after practical , verifiable steps by the US government and a test of their goodwill , "" he said in an interview earlier this week .
The revolutionary guard is one of the few institutions capable of standing up to president if it believes he is going too far and too fast .
Iran is at loggerheads with the US over its disputed nuclear program , which the west says is intent on developing weapons technology .
Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes ."
2013-10-08,"Britain and Iran have taken a significant step toward reopening their respective embassies in Tehran and London by appointing chargés d'affaires and holding talks about staffing on the eve of new negotiations over Iran 's nuclear programme .
William Hague , the UK foreign secretary , revealed to MPs that on Tuesday that talks with the Iranian government had taken place last week in a much more positive atmosphere following intensifying diplomatic contacts in the wake of the election of the moderate President Hassan Rouhani last June .
Progress would have to take place on a "" step - by - step reciprocal basis "" , Hague said , but he made clear he hoped the moves would pave the way to reopen the British embassy .
"" We are open to more direct contact , "" he said , adding that the coming months "" may be unusually significant "" in British - Iranian relations .
A non - resident diplomat is to be appointed by both countries and talks have already been held about the key issues of numbers and conditions for local staff – often harassed in the past by the Iranian authorities .
Inspection of premises was another matter being addressed .
"" It is clear that the new president and ministers in Iran are presenting themselves and their country in a much more positive way than in the recent past , "" the foreign secretary said .
"" There is no doubt that the tone of the meetings with them is different .
We must test the Iranian government 's sincerity to the full , and it is important that our channels of communication are open for that . ""
Britain , which was closely involved in the overthrow of the Iranian prime minister in 1953 , is often more vilified in Iran than the US .
Britain shut Iran 's embassy in London in November 2011 and expelled all its staff after its counterpart in Tehran was stormed in a way the UK insisted could not have taken place without the consent of the Iranian authorities .
A crowd ransacked offices and burned British flags in a protest over sanctions by Britain .
The mission was closed and all UK staff were evacuated following the attack , the most violent of a series of incidents that marked a deterioration in relations due to Iran 's wider dispute with the west over its nuclear programme .
The Foreign Office said in a statement : "" The UK will not have a diplomatic presence in Tehran until we are confident our staff will be safe and able to carry out the full range of functions . ""
Hague warned that the "" much more positive "" tone from Tehran would need to be matched by "" concrete action and a viable approach "" when the long - stalled nuclear talks resume in Geneva next week .
He hinted that the "" step - by - step "" approach would also help Iranian moderates win arguments with hardliners in the Islamic Republic .
He noted that Iran was still in breach of six UN resolutions over its nuclear programme , which Tehran denies is intended to develop nuclear weapons .
He said : "" In the absence of change to these policies we will continue to maintain strong sanctions .
A substantial change in British or western policies requires a substantive change in that programme . ""
Rouhani 's emollient message to the west , and especially a phone call with Barack Obama , was attacked by hardliners when he returned home after the UN general assembly in New York .
Iran 's foreign minister , Javad Zarif , who is now in charge of the hyper - sensitive nuclear file , met his British counterpart twice in the margins of the UN meeting .
The two men spoke again on Monday .
Israel , which has its own undeclared nuclear weapons arsenal , has publicly opposed any western rapprochement with Iran and described Rouhani as a "" wolf in sheep 's clothing .
"" Reporting on wider Middle Eastern issues , Hague also surveyed hopes for progress on holding a new Geneva peace conference on Syria , which is scheduled for mid - November .
But he said it was not clear whether Iran , a key supporter of Bashar al - Assad , would be invited to take part .
"" Iran will need to change its actual policies on the ground , which include supporting a regime which is murdering its people in huge numbers , "" Hague said .
Invitations are expected to be issued by the UN secretary - general .
The situation in Syria was "" catastrophic , "" Hague said , but he echoed positive reports about the early progress made to destroy the Syrian government 's chemical weapons arsenal ."
2013-10-09,"No news is good news , the adage tells us .
But just because something does not make it on to the evening news does not mean the situation has improved , as demonstrated by the US - sparked civil war in Iraq , which continues to exact a heavy toll .
Though the situation is nowhere near as bad , Egypt , too , has been eclipsed in the United States ' and much of the western media by the ongoing carnage in Syria , and by the new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani 's conciliatory gestures and charm offensive towards the west , not to mention the weekend 's US raids in Somalia and Libya .
But it is still very much news for us Egyptians and those who take a deep interest in the future of the country .
In fact , as my four - year - old and I embark on a trip home to his "" fatherland "" , I am plagued by worries and dogged by questions .
How much further will the violence escalate ?
Where will the clash between pro - military jingoism and divine demagoguery lead the country ?
Borrowing from the neocon American lexicon once so despised in Egypt , General Abdel - Fattah al - Sisi 's "" war on terror "" has , like its US counterpart , mushroomed into a war of terror , as reflected in the death this week of at least 50 people during pro - Morsi protests .
That is not to say there has n't been terrorism .
There has been plenty of it .
Not only have prominent Muslim Brotherhood members incited violence , but their sympathisers have torched churches across the country , and are mounting an insurgency in the already restive Sinai .
In addition , while pleading "" legitimacy "" and "" democracy "" abroad , Muslim Brotherhood leaders have falsely accused Christians of being behind Mohamed Morsi 's downfall .
This has fanned the flames of hatred towards an already vulnerable minority , leading even as far as murder .
But the Muslim Brotherhood does not have a monopoly on demonisation and false accusations .
Though I am a secularist to the core and , being an "" infidel "" , am vulnerable to the Islamist project , I have been distressed and alarmed by the fever pitch that mainstream hostility towards Brotherhood sympathisers has reached .
For example , the idea that they are all terrorists and that the Raba'a al - Adawiya protest camp was a terrorist den , which goes against the evidence of my own eyes , has gained a surprising amount of traction .
Besides which , the situation in Sinai is far more complex than the official narrative allows .
The local Bedouins have been sidelined , forgotten and neglected for decades , leading to a lot of grievances that Islamists can exploit ; and the military has allegedly targeted civilians , not just militants .
Then , there are Egypt 's rebels who lost their cause .
The Tamarod movement did a great job of highlighting Morsi 's loss of legitimacy and channelling public anger at his dictatorial ways .
Yet , the movement today sounds like a cheerleading squad for the military and its man of the moment , al - Sisi â€ “ even going so far as to defend the military trials against civilians it once opposed .
Little wonder that the revolutionaries who have not taken leave of their senses and principles are despondent .
As Ahmed Maher of the April 6 Youth Movement , one of the main driving forces behind the 2011 uprising against Mubarak , said : We are at square one as a revolution .
What can America do , some might wonder ?
Probably not that much , in light of Washington 's squandering â€ “ by propping up dictators and engaging in military misadventures
â€ “ of what remained of the goodwill it once enjoyed long ago .
There is one trump card Washington holds , though .
It can threaten to cut off military aid if the army does not end its crackdown , release political detainees , and implement serious reform rapidly .
( In fact , I would argue that Washington should also make military aid to Israel contingent on reaching a peace deal with the Palestinians . )
But the truth is that the situation is in the hands of the Egyptian people .
At a certain level , I understand why Egypt has reached this point .
For me and other desktop revolutionaries outside the country , it 's easy to talk ideals when we 're not confronted with the bitter daily reality .
After nearly three years of revolt , with precious little to show for it , Egyptians are suffering a sort of revolution fatigue .
Nevertheless , if Egypt does not change course , all the blood , sweat and tears Egyptians shed in their quest for freedom may prove to have been for nothing .
Morsi and the Brotherhood peddled the illusion that they had a divine , magical solution to all Egypt 's problems .
Instead , they proved to be a bearded version of the Mubarak regime .
They talked democracy , but they walked theocracy .
But it is a grave error to believe that my enemy 's enemy is my friend .
The army may have learnt to speak democracy , but autocracy is still in its blood .
Six decades of military dictatorship , a disastrous first transition following Mubarak 's ouster and a campaign that seems bent of purging Egypt of the Brotherhood â€ “ which could push Egypt over the abyss into civil strife
â€ “ are not promising signs .
More troubling still , al - Sisi has become a cult hero , with campaigns petitioning him to run for president and polls showing he would win , if he ran .
Even if we give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he is a man of integrity , the temptations of excessive power and popularity could potentially doom Egypt to decades more of dictatorship .
For that reason , I hope Egyptians reject both the military and the Muslim Brotherhood , and reject violence , no matter whom its target is .

2013-10-14,"In the Middle East , long - established alliances are shifting dramatically .
As one political leader in the region said to me recently : "" The ground is shaking under our feet and we must keep all our options open .
""
Three major events over the past three months have destabilised the old order : a military coup against Mohamed Morsi 's government in Egypt ; the Russian - American agreement to destroy Syria 's chemical weapons ; and a phone call between Obama and the new Iranian president Hassan Rouhani .
But first : what did the old order look like ?
Before Hosni Mubarak 's regime was overthrown in Egypt , the Middle East was split into two main axes .
The so - called axis of moderation – Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , UAE and Kuwait – was aligned with the west , supported the Palestinian National Authority and encouraged a political settlement with Israel .
The axis of resistance – Iran , Syria and the political movements of Hamas and Hezbollah – had a strained relationship with the west and considered a political settlement with Israel as a surrender .
Qatar and Turkey stood close to this axis , maintaining good relations with the axis of moderation .
The fall of Mubarak 's regime in January 2011 removed Egypt from the axis of moderation and triggered the current regional turmoil .
The Syrian uprising against the Bashar al - Assad regime drove the Hamas leadership out of Syria , and out of the axis of resistance .
Turkey and Qatar also moved further away after both expressing public support for the Syrian rebels .
In this way , the axis of resistance was transformed into an axis of Iranian - Shia power , extending from Tehran to Nouri al - Maliki 's government in Iraq and Hezbollah in Lebanon – a resilient axis united by support for the Assad regime .
After Morsi 's election , Turkey and Qatar lent Egypt financial and political support , forming a new strategic alliance .
Thus the coup that overthrew Morsi in July was a strategic earthquake .
But it was welcomed by what was left of the axis of moderation : Saudi Arabia , UAE , Kuwait , and Jordan .
The Saudi king congratulated the interim president of Egypt and , with Kuwait and the UAE , offered him a package of aid exceeding $ 12bn , and King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to visit Cairo after the coup .
However , Qatar and Turkey condemned the coup .
Iran , though not sorry to see Morsi go given his support for the Syrian revolution , was concerned to see Egypt strongly aligned once more with Iran 's enemies .
The aftershocks of the coup continue to affect the region .
The countries supporting it had hoped the military would enforce its rule in a matter of weeks , but they miscalculated : three months on the Egyptian scene has n't settled down .
There are still constant marches and protests , as well as an imposed evening curfew .
Military and security measures have been taken against the Sinai and several cities and villages opposing the coup , and are driving the country into a state of economic paralysis .
On a regional level , there were other miscalculations , too .
The new axis of moderation tried to topple the Islamist movements in Tunisia and Libya , while the Egyptian army began destroying the tunnels linking Gaza and Sinai as well as launching an extensive campaign against Hamas with the hope of ending its control of the Gaza Strip .
At the same time , the new axis of moderation also strained its relationship with Turkey , one of the most strategically important countries in the region .
However , the greatest miscalculation the new axis made was its evaluation of the Russian and American position on Syria .
This axis hoped Basher al - Assad 's regime would be quickly eliminated and replaced with a regime aligned with the axis of moderation , while also excluding jihadists from the scene .
Saudi and UAE diplomacy supported an American military strike against Assad .
They communicated with Russia to give assurances and incentives to ensure that the Russians would refrain from effective rejection of any strikes .
However , the Russian - American deal to disarm Syria 's chemical weapons was a surprise .
This was then followed by the developing closeness between Iran and both the US and Britain , which further complicated the situation and derailed the aims of the axis of moderation .
The restructuring of regional alliances is still ongoing .
The two countries that would benefit most from being politically close would be Turkey and Iran .
Iran , burdened by an economic blockade and on the verge of talks with the west , has an interest in the Iraqi and Syrian crises being resolved in a manner that would guarantee the preservation of its power while bringing stability to the region .
Meanwhile , Turkey also has an interest in putting an end to the bloodshed in Syria and Iraq because of the detrimental impact the conflicts are having on Turkey 's own stability and economic development .
In addition , Turkey 's relationship with the axis of moderation has deteriorated since the coup in Egypt , and it needs to make diplomatic moves to revive its regional influence .
However , the transformations in the region are expected not only to affect the position of countries , but that of the Islamist movements as well .
In particular it will be interesting to see how Hamas re - evaluates its regional relations and whether the targeting of the movement in Gaza will drive it to restore close relations with Iran .
The region as a whole has suffered from conflict between the two axes for years , and this has led to civil wars and sectarian conflict .
It is now clear that the struggle in Syria has reached a critical point for both sides , and there will be no solution unless Iranians , Turks and Arabs can work together .
As for Iraq , its legislative elections will be held in a few months .
Sectarian polarisation in the country is claiming hundreds of lives on a monthly basis .
Without reconciling Sunnis , Shias and Kurds , Iraq too is heading for more violence .
Conflicting axes can not achieve stability in the region ; only co - operative efforts of all the parties and countries involved can hope to do that .
Today this all seems a distant hope , and the region may have to experience more turmoil and chaos before this fact is accepted ."

2013-10-15,"The diplomacy has begun in Geneva , almost exactly four years since the last time Iran came close to a deal in the same city to limit its nuclear programme .
This time , despite leaden skies and heavy rain , the sense of optimism has returned .
A new reformist Iranian government under President Hassan Rouhani with a new mandate has sent a delegation with a set of concrete proposals on how curbs on the nuclear programme could be exchanged for sanctions relief .
Mohammad Javad Zarif , the foreign minister , flew to Geneva despite intense back pain which forced him to spend most of the fligh lying down .
Zarif has said that hardliner attacks triggered the spasms that have hobbled him since he returned to Tehran from meeting US secretary of state John Kerry at the UN last month .
This morning , Zarif presented a PowerPoint presentation entitled "" Closing an unnecessary crisis : Opening new horizons "" , at the start of a new round of talks - the first substantive nuclear negotiations since Hassan Rouhani 's election in June .
Zarif 's talk was in English , a contrast from his predecessor as chief negotiator , Saeed Jalili , who spoke Farsi almost exclusively .
One of the consequences is that the pace of talks , without the need for interpreters , is much faster .
There is less to translate too .
Zarif is much more concise speaker .
The PowerPoint presentation took nearly an hour and then there was another hour of discussion before the first session broke up and the six nation group of negotiators ( from the US , UK , France , Germany , Russia and China ) , chaired by the EU foreign policy chief , Cathy Ashton , dispersed to study the Iranian proposals .
Zarif left for his hotel without talking to reporters , saying only : "" I 'm really in pain . ""
The twinges in his back were apparently not the only reminder of the pressures back home .
According to one Iranian report , the delegation got an urgent phone call from Tehran just before the talks began , demanding a last - minute change to the Iranian presentation .
Ashton 's spokesman , Michael Mann , said the talks began with "" cautious optimism and great sense of determination , because we think it is time for tangible results .
"" A senior US official said that the goal in Geneva was progress towards confidence - building measures that would slow down the Iranian nuclear programme to buy time for a more enduring solution .
The official said : To get to a comprehensive agreement is very , very difficult with highly technical issues that have to be resolved .
We need to put some time on the clock to rebuild trust ... to constrain the programme and even take it back a notch .
The US official pointed out that the American delegation included two financial experts to discuss changes to the sanctions regime , so that a quick deal was feasible . ""
If they are ready to go , we are ready to go , "" the official said ."
2013-10-15,"Tuesday 's opening of yet another round of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear - weapons program creates enormous risks for America 's anti - proliferation efforts .
Tehran 's extensive propaganda campaign , stressing the "" moderation "" of its new president , Hassan Rouhani , seems to be working , softening up the gullible in the United States and Europe .
As in previous iterations of the charade now reopening in Geneva , Iran 's bargaining position benefits from our own repeated mistakes .
The ayatollahs need only take advantage of these unforced errors , and success may well fall into their undeserving hands .
Consider the most blatant errors that Iran is eager to exploit .
First , both Presidents Bush and Obama conceded that Iran was entitled to a "" peaceful "" nuclear program , for energy and scientific purposes .
Under the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , however , that view is flatly wrong .
By pursuing nuclear weapons for over two decades , Iran has violated key NPT provisions â€ “ notably , the obligation it freely undertook to be a non - nuclear weapons state .
Tehran is not , therefore , entitled to claim benefits under NPT sections permitting peaceful uses of nuclear power .
Beyond treaty interpretation , Iran 's long record of ignoring its commitments and lying about its nuclear program demonstrates beyond dispute that it can not be trusted .
What conceivable reason exists to believe today 's pledge to abstain from nuclear weapons when the ayatollahs have violated so many previous pledges ?
Only if credibility counts for nothing would Iran 's likely upcoming "" commitment "" hold any weight .
Second , by allowing Iran to possess any uranium enrichment , nuclear reactors , or spent nuclear fuel reprocessing capabilities , the west will both legitimize Iran 's nuclear program and ensure that it can move to weaponization at a time entirely of its choosing .
President Obama 's negotiators conceded last year that Iran could enrich uranium to reactor - grade levels , so long as it did n't enrich to higher levels .
But reactor - grade enrichment levels already take Iran nearly 70 % of the way to weapons - grade enrichment .
"" Stopping "" enrichment above standard reactor - grade levels saves , at best , a few weeks of enrichment effort .
By misunderstanding the physics of uranium enrichment , the Obama administration has made a mockery of itself .
Third , the White House retort that international inspections will prevent Iran from speedily moving to weaponization is a complete fiction .
Given the broad , deep nuclear infrastructure Iran is building aggressively , Tehran need merely expel the International Atomic Energy Agency when it chooses to do so , and then move rapidly to weaponization .
North Korea expelled the IAEA ten years ago , and Iran will calculate it can do so , too .
Even with the IAEA in - country , Iran 's large territory and mountainous topography will greatly facilitate concealing its ongoing nuclear activities .
Mineral "" mines "" , for example , can easily hide nuclear - related work ; or Iran could build facilities elsewhere , such as North Korea , with which it has co - operated for over 15 years on ballistic - missile programs .
Fourth , what Iran really wants near - term , and what the west seems poised to give , is relief from international economic sanctions .
Although these measures have caused Iran economic pain , there is no evidence they have impeded the nuclear program .
Obama 's director of National Intelligence , James Clapper , so testified earlier this year , and the IAEA has repeatedly reaffirmed that Iran 's nuclear program continues to grow at alarming rates .
While America and Europe insist they will demand reciprocal concessions for any weakening of the sanctions , Iran ( with its backers , Russia and China ) is bargaining from a position of strength .
The ayatollahs sense from Obama 's desperate efforts for a handshake or phone call with Rouhani at September 's UN opening that he is hungry for a deal , thus allowing them to extract concession from the west before making even a superficial response .
Our negotiators are already talking about "" sequencing "" steps by the two sides â€ “ meaning , in reality , we will make the first concessions , hoping that Iran will make substantive concession later .
In fact , the likely scenario is the exact opposite : Obama will make significant reductions in sanctions that will be very hard to restore subsequently , and Iran will give us blue smoke and mirrors .
Even worse , these non - reciprocal episodes could continue at length , giving Tehran another precious resource , time , to continue building its nuclear facilities .
There is a theoretical case that economic sanctions might , at some point in the past , have been sufficient to bring Iran 's nuclear efforts to a halt .
Our historical experience , however , demonstrates that economic restrictions must meet several preconditions before they can achieve any significant geopolitical objective .
To be effective , sanctions must be sweeping and comprehensive ; swiftly and unhesitatingly applied ; and widely complied with or rigorously ( that is , militarily ) enforced .
None of these criteria has met in the case of Iran .
Sanctions have been applied sporadically , in a piecemeal fashion , have had only intermittent and ineffective enforcement , and often have been flatly disregarded by Iran 's champions , including Russia and China .
Accordingly , therefore , even if the current sanctions were continued or tightened â€ “ highly unlikely in present circumstances â€ “ they would prove insufficient .
We have only two very unpleasant choices : either Iran gets nuclear weapons in the very near future , or pre - emptive military force , fully justified by well - established principles of self - defense , must break Iran 's control over the nuclear fuel cycle and prevent ( or , at least , substantially delay ) weaponization .
President Obama has said repeatedly that "" all options are on the table "" , the standard euphemism for military action .
But , especially after Syria , no one believes him , the ayatollahs in Tehran , most notably .
By default that leaves Israel , which is watching today 's negotiations most uneasily .
The fact is we should n't trust and ca n't verify Iranian promises not to fabricate nuclear weapons .
Indeed , even now , Washington really does n't know how quickly Iran could assemble a small number of nuclear weapons .
But a crash program has never really been Tehran 's objective .
Iran is playing a much longer game that the west , largely because it fears neither our sanctions nor a possible military strike .
Our inability to see through this strategy has brought us grief time and again .
Unfortunately , in Geneva , we may be watching a re - run ."
2013-10-24,"Bookshops in Iran could soon be allowed to stock a wider range of titles , after culture minister Ali Jannati said that "" books subjected to censorship or denied permission to be published in the past will be reviewed again "" .
The minister 's words suggested an opening - up of the country 's publishing industry under new president Hassan Rouhani , who has already signalled his willingness to make changes by agreeing to the first presidential telephone conversation with America since the 1979 revolution .
A swathe of literary classics and international bestsellers including Tracy Chevalier 's Girl With a Pearl Earring and Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code were banned in Iran in a publishing lockdown imposed by former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2006 , soon after he came to power .
According to Egypt 's Ahramonline news outlet , Jannati told Iran 's official news agency IRNA this week : "" Those books subjected to censorship or denied permission to be published in the past will be reviewed again and new decisions will be made .
Our approach towards freedom of the press and books , as well as relaxing the atmosphere for writers and thinkers , is different from the past and its results will gradually become apparent .
"" In the reformist daily newspaper , Arman , Jannati was quoted earlier this month , saying : "" I sadly learned that some books were denied permission to be published only on the grounds of personal opinions .
I think if the Qu'ran was not a divine revelation , when it was handed to the book supervisory board , they would say some words did not comply with public chastity and would deny it permission for publication . ""
"" I would hazard a guess that we wo n't be seeing The Satanic Verses appear anytime soon in a new Iranian edition , but one hopes that the works of banned Iranian authors such as the great Sadegh Hedayat , Shahrnoush Parsipour and the late Houshang Golshiri will be given freer rein now , "" said Mitch Albert , of Westbourne Press , an independent , London - based publishing house specialising in books on North Africa and the Middle East .
He added : "" The culture minister 's remark that even the Qur'an would not have passed current censorship laws is certainly a strong one , in the Iranian context .
Let us hope it leads to greater freedom of expression . ""
Apart from international imports banned in 2006 , such as William Faulkner 's As I Lay Dying and collections of lyrics by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , the relaxation of censorship could affect scores of works by Iranian authors including Ebrahim Golestan , and Hedayat , whose novel The Blind Owl was listed as one of Iran 's top 10 books by journalist Kamin Mohammadi .
Albert said that Iran 's cultural overtures were significant and should be taken at face value .
"" I get irritated by people 's reflected caution and the assumption that there must be an ulterior motive .
There is a liberalising strain in the culture which has not been given expression in the past , but they are coming to realise that it 's better to be part of the global community than not , "" he said .
Jannati 's comments echo president Rouhani 's assertion , during his swearing - in speech in August , that he would relax restraints on internet filters .
In an interview with CNN last month , Rouhani said : "" All my efforts are geared to ensure that the people of Iran will comfortably be able to access all information globally and to use it .
There are large social networks at a global level around today .
And I believe that all human beings have a right , and all nations have a right , to use them . ""
The country blocks access to at least five million websites , including Facebook and Twitter .
Rouhani , whose Twitter account , @hassanrouhani , is thought to be run by a close associate , earlier this month tweeted to Jack Dorsey , Twitter co - founder , that he would work to ensure that Iranians have access to all information globally "" as is their # right "" [ ] ."
2013-11-04,"Thousands of Iranian hardliners have rallied at the former US embassy in Tehran to commemorate the 1979 US hostage crisis , highlighting the domestic challenges the country 's president , Hassan Rouhani , faces in his bid to mend ties with the west .
In a nationwide event marking the anniversary of the day angry students stormed the embassy 34 years ago and took 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days , large crowds sympathetic to the Revolutionary Guards and its informal voluntary basij militia took to the streets on Monday , chanting "" death to America "" and burning US flags .
Demonstrations have been held annually on the "" national day against global arrogance "" .
But this year , with Rouhani 's new administration attempting to improve relations with Washington , it became a show of defiance by hardliners adamantly opposed to a thaw in relations .
Many senior officials failed to turn up for Monday 's rallies and there was no sign of Rouhani or his cabinet members .
Instead , Saeed Jalili , a former nuclear negotiator who ran as the most anti - western candidate and was defeated in the last presidential election , took to the podium in Tehran . ""
Death to America means death to arrogance , death to violence …
Death to America is a symbol , "" he reportedly said .
"" The Iranian people turned it into a symbol for seeking freedom and seeking independence . ""
Witnesses said that demonstrators appeared to be part of organised groups bussed in by the guards or the basij .
Hundreds of students from various schools and universities in the Iranian capital were also given a day off to attend the rallies .
Some were carrying cardboard models of a uranium enrichment centrifuge .
"" America ca n't do a damn thing , "" said a banner , which is a famous quote by the late founder of the Islamic republic , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
A Tehran - based journalist allowed to cover the demonstrations for the American network NBC tweeted a picture of his official press card issued by the Iranian officials , which had "" Down with USA "" printed on it .
Many of the students who played a key role in the 1979 embassy takeover have become reformists and have been largely marginalised , including Ebrahim Asgharzadeh , Habibollah Bitaraf and Mohsen Mirdamadi , who was jailed in 2009 .
Before Monday 's rallies , Asgharzadeh , one of the five key students behind the hostage - taking , told local website Ghanoon they intended to occupy the embassy for no more than 48 hours but lost control . ""
We only wanted to stage a sit - in protest and did not anticipate such resistance from them ; we did not intend to take anyone hostage , "" he said .
"" But [ later ] we became hostages ourselves of this hostage - taking . ""
To the dismay of Iranian authorities , the hostage crisis became the subject of the Oscar - winning Argo , a 2012 thriller by Ben Affleck .
Iran has since promised to retaliate by producing its own version of the events .
In his speech , Jalili said the seizure of "" the nest of spies "" , a reference to the former US embassy , showed to the world that American embassies were a base for spying .
The ex - embassy 's compound , situated in central Tehran , has been transformed into a museum run by the basij which exhibits some of the documents and belongings confiscated in 1979 .
Despite his anti - US rhetoric , Jalili said Iranians are united behind their negotiators .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , also made a speech on Sunday in which he said he was not optimistic about the ongoing negotiations with the west over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
But he voiced strong support for Rouhani 's diplomacy . ""
No one should consider our negotiators as compromisers , "" he said .
"" They have a difficult mission and no one must weaken an official who is busy with work .
"" Iran and the six major powers – Britain , China , France , Russia , the US and Germany – are due to resume nuclear talks in Geneva later this week within a month of holding a similar event in October .
In his speech , without naming Edward Snowden and his revelations , Khamenei also alluded to the furore over the scale of US intelligence surveillance . ""
On that day , our youths named the US embassy the ' den of espionage ' and today , after over three decades , US embassies in the European countries , which are American allies , are called nests of espionage , "" said Khamenei . ""
This shows that our youths were over 30 years ahead of the world calendar . ""
Rouhani issued a statement on Sunday night thanking Khamenei for his support for the negotiating team and said Iran was not at odds with the American people .
In September , Rouhani travelled to New York for the UN general assembly , launching a largely successful charm offensive .
That visit featured a historic phone conversation between Rouhani and Barack Obama , the first direct talks between US and Iranian presidents since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
But the backlash from the visit is still creating ripples at home , where anti - US sentiment is the very bedrock of the Islamic republic 's ideology for many of its conservatives and fundamentalists .
After Rouhani 's return from New York , a debate began to grow on whether the authorities should officially drop the "" death to America "" slogans , but opposition from hardliners mean they will not disappear any time soon .
Last month , Tehran citizens noticed a series of billboards in streets showing an Iranian negotiator talking face to face behind a table to his American counterpart , pictured as a half - civilian , half - military man with a pump - action shotgun in his lap .
Opponents of the billboards said they were installed to undermine Rouhani 's diplomacy with Washington , which led to Tehran city officials taking them off the streets .
The billboards have since returned , highlighting the top - level internal disagreements in Iran .
Meanwhile , early on Monday , as demonstrators prepared for the anti - American rallies , judicial authorities executed Sherko Moarefi , an Iranian Kurdish activist who had been in jail since 2008 – despite a long campaign by human rights activists calling on Iran to halt his death sentence , saying he did not get a fair trial .."
2013-11-08,"Hardliners in Tehran , hawks in Tel Aviv and Washington , nervous Saudis and their Gulf allies are all alarmed at the prospect of a nuclear deal between Iran , the US and the international community .
Initial reactions from conservative opponents of President Hassan Rouhani have been predictably critical - with warnings that all sanctions had to be lifted and Iran 's right to uranium enrichment recognised before confidence - building measures could proceed .
So were the openly angry words from the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , still hinting at a unilateral strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities .
The agreement reached in Switzerland was , he warned , "" the deal of the century "" for the Islamic Republic .
But Israel – with its own undeclared atomic arsenal – would not be bound by it .
In the US , suspicions look likely to harden on Capitol Hill as the crucial details of the Geneva agreement , and especially any relief from sanctions , become clear .
The White House has already had to urge Congress not to tie its hands in the talks with Iran .
Saudi Arabia , which has dramatically demonstrated its chagrin at Barack Obama 's policies towards both Iran and Syria , kept silent on Friday .
But no one has forgotten – thanks to WikiLeaks –
King Abdullah 's famous call to "" cut off the head of the snake "" in Tehran .
Warnings this week that the kingdom may acquire its own nuclear weapons from Pakistan were a reminder – perhaps a deliberate one – of the high stakes being played for in the Middle East .
The United Arab Emirates is also likely to be deeply unhappy about the beginning of a rapprochement between its powerful regional rival and traditional protector .
The US secretary of state , John Kerry , who was putting the finishing touches to the P5 + 1 agreement in Geneva , has already had to reassure the Gulf states , as well as Jordan and Egypt , that America will not allow them to be targeted by Iran .
Bahrain , with its restive and repressed Shia majority , worries in particular about this .
Tehran , warned one influential Gulf commentator , could interpret a nuclear agreement as "" American acquiescence in Iranian meddling in their allies affairs "" .
Opposition everywhere should , however , be tempered by the fact that the emerging deal looks likely to be phased , limited and reversible , offering partial relief from crippling sanctions in return for verifiable progress on international monitoring of Iran 's nuclear programme .
In the Islamic Republic , the key to momentum will be sufficiently tangible economic improvements to build up the popular support Rouhani needs to bolster his position vis - a - vis diehard conservatives and the Revolutionary Guards , imbued with decades of suspicion towards the US , the west and their Arab allies .
The continuing confrontation over the war in Syria , where Tehran and Lebanon 's Hezbollah back Bashar al - Assad to the hilt while the Saudis support the Sunni rebels , has been a vivid reminder of Iran 's regional reach and influence .
For the moment though , Rouhani appears to enjoy the backing of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has urged critics "" not to consider our negotiators as compromisers "" .
Israel 's ill - tempered opposition – even before anything has been formally agreed – looks set to further strain its already tense relations with Washignton . ""
Netanyahu unwise to challenge US so openly / dismissively on possible Iran nuclear deal , "" tweeted Nicholas Burns , a former senior US diplomat .
"" Netanyahu 's outburst was a serious tactical error .
"" The Israeli prime minister has taken a hard line on this issue for years , so it is no surprise he is taking the news badly .
It is still hard to imagine , however , that Israel would attack Iran – even if it has the military capability to do so alone – while a prolonged and internationally backed agreement is in place ."
2013-11-08,"From his room in Geneva 's InterContinental hotel on Friday morning , the Iranian foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , could take in the sweeping view of Mont Blanc looming over Lake Geneva before an intensive day of diplomacy with his US and European counterparts .
Many would take in this idyllic vista and think of skiing and hiking , but for Iran 's most senior diplomat it might well suggest the "" mountain of challenges "" – as the Persian idiom has it – that he and President Hassan Rouhani face back home .
As Zarif met the EU 's foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , and prepared to shake the hands of the US secretary of state , John Kerry , hardliners in Tehran made clear they were still opposed to the United States and feared any prospect of an agreement in Geneva . ""
Death to America , "" chanted crowds sympathetic to the elite Revolutionary Guards and its voluntary Basij militia gathered at Tehran University in the centre of the city for Friday prayers .
The Geneva talks were held on Thursday and Friday , the Iranian weekend , which is likely to have reduced the public backlash in Iran , but still the hardliners made their voices heard .
The leader of Tehran 's Friday prayers , Ayatollah Ali Movahedi Kermani , said in remarks broadcast live on national radio that any deal with the west would be detrimental to Iran . ""
It 's harmful to underestimate the enemy because they do nothing but play tricks , "" Kermani said .
"" Our enemy would not rest even for a moment .
If we underestimate the enemy , we will definitely get hurt . ""
The imam was particularly critical of assurances Kerry gave to Israel 's prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , before leaving Tel Aviv for Geneva . ""
The US secretary of state has promised Netanyahu that he will not do a bad deal with Iran , "" he said .
"" This means that they will not agree to anything that is harmful for them – which means they will not make a good deal with Iran . ""
Reflecting remarks this week by Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has said that he is not optimistic about the talks , Kermani said : "" I do n't think the talks will bear fruit .
They [ the enemy ] are not going to stop their hostility towards us . ""
Despite Kermani 's warning , Rouhani 's diplomacy appears to have the support of Khamenei , who has ultimate power in all state matters .
Khamenei has criticised those who labelled Iran 's nuclear negotiators "" compromisers "" , warning that they had a difficult mission and no one should "" weaken an official who is busy with work "" .
Iran 's conservative - dominated parliament has so far been silent about the trajectory of the talks , although a group of MPs criticised Rouhani 's team for keeping the details of a possible accord secret from the public and called them to parliament for questioning .
Others said it was necessary the talks remained secret at this stage .
On Friday , Alaeddin Boroujerdi , the head of the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy , signalled his approval of the Geneva talks .
He told the Isna news agency that the ground had been prepared for an agreement that would ease western sanctions and that it was compatible with Iran 's national interests .
Khamenei 's backing of Zarif 's team means many of the more hawkish fundamentalists have refrained from criticising the new government 's diplomacy directly .
Instead , they have warned against giving in to the west 's demands .
Before Rouhani 's largely successful visit to the UN in New York in September , Khamenei gave him more authority by talking of "" heroic flexibility "" .
That visit brought a historic phone conversation between Rouhani and Barack Obama , the first direct talks between Iranian and US leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution . ""
Khamenei himself is also under lots of pressure , "" an Iranian analyst said , asking not to be identified .
"" The hardliners in the Revolutionary Guards are surrounding him all the time and sabotaging Rouhani 's diplomacy by injecting scepticism about Americans and their intentions . ""
As Rouhani passes his first 100 days in office , he can claim credit for a number of election promises that have been fulfilled .
A number of leading activists have been released from prison and Tehran has taken serious steps to improve ties with the west , not least breaking the 34-year taboo of talking directly to the US at the highest level .
A Tehran University professor , Sadegh Zibakalam , said by telephone that he anticipated a historic moment in Iran 's relationship with the west .
"" We did n't expect this , but it seems that Rouhani 's ' key ' is opening many doors and a historic agreement may be under way , "" he said , referring to the key Rouhani adopted as the symbol of his election campaign .
"" We do n't know much about the details of this possible deal but to me what 's important is that for the first time in 35 years since the 1979 Islamic republic , it appears Iran and the west are trusting each other despite sabotage by hardliners in Iran , in Washington or Tel Aviv .
For the first time , it seems Iran has trusted the US and Europe 's words that they are not seeking regime change and that the sole issue here is the nuclear programme .
The west , on the other hand , seems to have taken Iran 's word that it will open the doors to IAEA inspectors and have nothing to hide . ""
Zibakalam said hardliners in Tehran were driven by rivalry with Rouhani 's moderate administration .
"" It is partly true that in general , hardliners do n't want the Rouhani team to succeed .
"" They are even ready to sacrifice national interests for their political gains and internal rivalry , "" he said .
"" There is also a third group of people who really do n't believe we should have any sort of dialogue or relations with the west . """
2013-11-19,"Differences between Iran and the west that have so far prevented a historic nuclear deal appear to have narrowed considerably as negotiators gather for a new round of talks in Geneva on Wednesday .
On Tuesday the Iranian foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , launched a slickly produced YouTube channel with a declaration that the path to a resolution of the decade - old dispute over Iran 's nuclear programme was open , and called on the world powers to seize a "" historic opportunity "" .
Zarif 's move came as David Cameron spoke on the phone to Hassan Rouhani , becoming the first British prime minister to speak to an Iranian president in a decade . ""
The two leaders discussed the bilateral relationship between Britain and Iran welcoming the steps taken since President Rouhani took office , including the appointment of non - resident Charges d'Affaires last week , "" a spokesperson for the PM said .
"" They agreed to continue efforts to improve the relationship on a step by step and reciprocal basis . ""
"" On Iran 's nuclear programme , both leaders agreed that significant progress had been made in the recent Geneva negotiations and that it was important to seize the opportunity presented by the further round of talks which get underway tomorrow . ""
The previous round of Geneva talks adjourned early , on 10 November , after an intense and dramatic three days of discussions fell just short of agreement following an intervention by the French foreign minister , Laurent Fabius , to toughen the western bargaining position .
In a Saturday night meeting with the US secretary of state , John Kerry , Fabius insisted that the six powers at the talks – the US , France , the UK , Germany , Russia and France – should not grant Iran 's right to uranium enrichment but should demand the cessation of Iran 's construction work on a plutonium - producing heavy water reactor at Arak .
Zarif said he would have to consult Tehran on the 11th - hour changes , and the high - level talks broke up .
Since then , there have been clear signs of behind - the - scenes progress .
On Sunday , Zarif was quoted in the semi - official Isna news agency as saying Iran 's right to enrich was "" non - negotiable "" , but adding that the Iranians "" see no necessity for its recognition as a right "" . ""
The right to enrichment does not need to be recognised because , according to the NPT [ nuclear non - proliferation treaty ] , this right is inalienable , "" the foreign minister said .
If carried through to the negotiating table , the Iranian concession could remove a huge stumbling block .
Western officials all accept that some degree of Iranian enrichment is an inevitable part of any eventual settlement but Washington and its allies have been reluctant to put that acceptance in writing as it would create a potentially dangerous precedent .
Uranium enrichment is dual - purpose – it can produce fuel both for nuclear power stations and for warheads .
In the western camp , there have also been hints that a compromise could be found over Arak .
The French insistence on a complete halt to work on the heavy water reactor was not shared by the whole government , a French defence source said .
"" There is a debate going on in Paris , between the Quai d'Orsay [ the foreign ministry ] and the Élysée [ the presidency ] on that position , "" the source said .
German officials are believed to have shared some of the French concerns about a stopgap deal signed in haste in Geneva under pressure to produce results by the presence of Kerry and other foreign ministers .
But the Germans disapproved of Fabius 's decision to break ranks and make the divisions within the six - nation group public .
Talks since the last Geneva round appear to have resolved some of the differences inside the western camp .
"" I 'm very optimistic there is an understanding .
Some of the sensitive work will be shut down .
The Europeans are hopeful this will not now be a problem , "" said Mark Hibbs , a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
The purpose of the interim deal under discussion in Geneva is to slow down the Iran programme , halting and rolling back some elements , in return for limited sanctions .
The deal would last for six months , during which time negotiations would continue aimed at a more enduring settlement .
Among the elements on the table are a halt to Iranian production of medium - enriched uranium , of 20 % purity , and a dilution of the existing stockpile of nearly 200 kg or its conversion into oxide for reactor fuel .
That would add an extra month or so to the time Iran would need to turn it into weapons - grade uranium if it decided to make a weapon .
A cap on the stockpile of low - enriched , reactor - grade uranium is also likely to form part of the stopgap deal , and a freeze on Iran 's enrichment capacity , halting the production and installation of new - model centrifuges , for example .
In return for such concessions , Iran would receive an estimated $ 10bn ( £ 6bn ) in sanctions relief , in the form of unfreezing blocked bank accounts , and the end of restrictions on trade in gold , petrochemicals and aircraft parts .
Officials involved in the talks point out that each of these elements involves separate highly detailed , technical agreements , and so caution that striking a bargain could be a drawn - out and painstaking process .
However , both Washington and Tehran are under pressure to achieve a deal quickly to keep domestic political pressure at bay .
The US Congress is threatening to pass new sanctions legislation , which could derail the negotiations .
"" The US Congress has recently been seeking to approve a bill to increase sanctions against Iran , "" said Mohammad - Hassan Asafari a senior member of Iran 's parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy .
"" It has been decided that the negotiations be suspended if the bill gets through the US Congress . ""
Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , warned on Monday in a phone conversation with Russia 's president , Vladimir Putin , that "" excessive demands "" could hamper any possible deal . ""
At the recent Geneva talks good progress was made , but everyone must realise excessive demands could complicate the process towards a win - win agreement , "" the Iranian president told Putin , according to the state English - language television Press TV . ""
From our point of view , there should not be a situation in which the will of parties to reach mutually acceptable agreement is affected . ""
The negotiations continue to put a severe strain on US - Israeli relations .
Following persistent warnings against striking a deal in Geneva from the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , Kerry made it clear that he would not be visiting Jerusalem later this week , despite an announcement to that effect made by Netanyahu .
Instead , Kerry 's aides said he would try to find time for a trip after the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November .
On Monday , the secretary of state spoke about Netanyahu 's right "" to publicly state his position and defend what he believes is his interest "" .
But , in a direct rebuttal of Israel 's position , he added : "" Nothing that we are doing here , in my judgment , will put Israel at any additional risk .
In fact , let me make this clear , we believe it reduces risk .
"" The progress in Geneva came as the White House also appeared to be holding congressional hawks at bay in Washington .
Barack Obama held a meeting with US senators at the White House on Tuesday to ask them to hold off further sanctions for now while the talks appeared so close to a breakthrough .
Obama revealed details of the proposed deal with Iran during a conference in Washington on Tuesday afternoon .
It would relax some sanctions , but not oil exports or banking , in exchange for a temporary suspension in Iran 's nuclear efforts while all sides seek a lasting solution .
"" Some of the reporting has been inaccurate , understandably because the [ countries involved ] have kept the negotiations tight , but the essence of the deal would be that they would halt advances on their nuclear programme , they would roll back some elements that would get them closer to break out capacity where they could run for a weapon before the international community had a chance to react , and they would subject themselves to more vigorous inspections , "" Obama told a conference of business leaders . ""
In return , [ we would ] open up the spigot a little bit for a very modest amount of relief that is entirely subject to reinstatement if they violate the agreement , "" he added .
"" It would purchase a period of time , lets say six months , during which we could see if they could get to the end state of a position where we , the Israelis and the international community could say with confidence that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon .
"" Details of the proposed deal , hitherto hazy , may add to pressure from Israel and hawkish Republicans in Washington who say Iran is being let off the hook ."
2013-11-21,"Foreign ministers from six major powers are poised to fly to Geneva by the end of the week if nuclear talks with Iran lead to an agreement , western officials said on Wednesday night .
A new round of negotiations over the future of Iran 's nuclear programme got under way on Wednesday , bringing together the Iranian foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , the EU foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , and top diplomats from the US , UK , France , Germany , Russia and China .
Officials involved in the talks – the third session since the election of a reformist Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani – said they were going well , overcoming the disappointment of the previous round , attended by US secretary of state , John Kerry , the British foreign secretary , William Hague , their French counterpart , Laurent Fabius , and other foreign ministers .
Those talks appeared to come close to clinching a historic deal but the talks broke up in early hours of 10 November , amid some acrimony over who was responsible for the failure .
This time , amid talk of progress , hotel rooms were being cleared for Friday in case the ministers returned to Geneva and advance security teams were making contingency preparations .
Kerry 's spokeswoman , Jen Psaki , said he had yet to make a decision about attending . ""
He 's open to going if it would continue to help narrow the gaps .
He has not made a decision at this point to go , but obviously , we 're in close touch with the negotiating team and will make a decision , clearly , in the next 36 hours , "" Psaki said .
The negotiators still have to overcome the obstacles that stymied the previous Geneva session , but the differences appear to be narrowing .
Zarif has signalled that Tehran might no longer insist on hammering out wording in the interim agreement that explicitly guarantees that Iran has the right to enrich uranium .
Officials say there could instead be references to Iran 's right to have a peaceful nuclear programme under the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty , a statement that each side could interpret in its own way .
On the other major sticking point from the last round , the fate of Iran 's heavy water reactor under construction in Arak , there is also discussion of possible compromise language which would not suspend all construction work but would halt the most sensitive element of that work , the manufacture of fuel rods .
However , a senior western diplomat said there was still some way to go .
The negotiators are working on the draft text of a joint statement that would detail an interim deal which would slow down , and in some areas halt or roll back , the Iranian nuclear programme , while granting limited western sanctions relief .
The stopgap deal , which would last six months , would buy time for deeper negotiations aimed at a more enduring settlement to the decade - long deadlock .
"" Lots of progress was made last time .
But considerable gaps remain and we have to narrow the gaps .
Some issues really need to be clarified , "" the senior western diplomat said .
"" I sensed a real commitment … from both sides .
Will it happen ?
We will see .
But as always , the devil is in the details .
"" There are very technical issues at stake ; it is important to have clear understanding on technical elements in order to ensure a robust and viable agreement .
This needs to be done in a proper way –
we will take the time we need .
"" A senior US official said : "" We have all agreed that the document that was on the table at the end of our session last time would be our basis on discussion to go forward here
and I certainly expect that we will be talking about the text .
"" Time is not unlimited , but we are making very good progress and people have arrived back here with a commitment to do the hard work necessary to try a reach a common agreement .
This is tough .
There 's a lot at stake , and Iran is not the only country in the room . ""
The assessment of Zarif 's deputy , Abbas Araqchi , was rather more downbeat , indicating that some trust had been lost at the last round when the Iranians thought they had been close to a deal but the western position , at France 's prompting , toughened at the 11th hour . ""
Because of the misunderstandings and problems that occurred at the previous round of talks , we have n't yet returned to the same position [ that we had ] , "" Araqchi said , according to the Mehr news agency .
"" Some issues need to be clarified and trust needs to be restored once again before we enter the phase of drafting or writing the document . ""
The cautious approach mirrored the tone set by Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , who said he had set strict parameters for his country 's negotiating team .
"" We do insist that we will not step back one iota from our rights , "" Khamenei told a rally of volunteer militiamen , the Basij .
"" We do not intervene in the details of these talks .
There are certain red lines and limits .
These have to be observed .
They are instructed to abide by those limits . """
2013-11-30,"The interim deal between six leading world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme , agreed in late - night talks last weekend , could – if it bears fruit in the long term – transform the wider region ; it could redraw the map of an area that has been gripped by conflict or the threat of conflict for generations .
In the midst of a growing schism between Shia and Sunni Muslims in the Middle East , fuelled by the war in Syria , an agreement that reduces the threat of an Israeli attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities , sanctioned by the US , presents enormous possibilities as well as potential threats .
The first and most obvious benefit of the deal , ignored by Israel 's hawkish prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , his allies in the US Congress and Saudi Arabia , is that the diplomacy that led to the interim six - month agreement is the first indication that under the new president , Hassan Rouhani , Tehran 's clerical regime might now see the benefit of negotiating solutions to the region 's problems , rather than its previous angry posturing under former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It is conceivable that such a shift might , at some point in the future , involve Tehran reconsidering its support for the Syrian regime of Bashar al - Assad and Hezbollah .
An Iran a step further back from conflict with Israel , and potentially minded to meddle less in the region , would be a good thing if Tehran sticks to its part of the deal : to dilute its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 % so that it is returned to 5 % enriched , and not go ahead with the commissioning of the Arak reactor , which is able to produce plutonium .
But the deal creates new tensions as well in a Middle East already challenged by the upheavals of the 2011 Arab spring .
Washington 's decision to sideline its allies Israel and Saudi Arabia in the secret bilateral negotiations with Iran that began in August is in some respects as significant for the future as the nuclear deal .
Specifically for Israel , it can be seen as a rebuke to Netanyahu 's long and vociferous insistence that Iran and its nuclear programme be treated by the US as an "" existential threat "" .
It also marks a significant reshaping of the relationship with Sunni Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states .
Riyadh not only fears the influence of a resurgent Iran – with which it is increasingly engaged in a proxy sectarian conflict in Syria – but is furious at what it sees as Washington 's betrayal .
Turkey and Egypt , too , have been discomfited by the prospect that a deal might allow the emergence of Shia Iran – in alliance with Shia - dominated Iraq – as a significant regional power .
It is how these existing rivalries over the Iranian deal fit into the region 's widening fracture lines that will define the future of the Middle East .
A changing region Turkey Relations between Turkey and Iran have been worsening in recent years , not least since Turkey agreed in 2011 to house a Nato radar base and as a consequence of the war in Syria , where Ankara has helped the Sunni rebels .
However , energy - poor Turkey has been hard hit economically by the sanctions regime imposed against Iran .
But the deal in Geneva appears to have given fresh impetus to efforts to thaw relations between Sunni majority Turkey and Tehran , with the Iranian president scheduled to visit Turkey in December .
A thaw in relations between Ankara and Tehran could have positive consequences for efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the war in Syria .
Syria and Lebanon
The interim deal on Iran is a double - edged sword for Syria and Lebanon , which in different ways have both seen the fallout of the increased religious tension stoked by the war in Syria and by competition between Saudi and the Gulf states on one side and Iran on the other .
On the plus side is the notion that if Iran holds to its side of the nuclear bargain it might persuade the international community to give Tehran a role in a Syrian peace process that could bring that conflict to an end .
More likely , in the short term , is that friction between the parties will continue to be played out in proxy confrontations both in Syria , where Iranian Lebanese client group Hezbollah is openly fighting on the Assad side , and in Lebanon itself .
Israel and the peace process The anger of prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his allies both in Israel and the US Congress over the deal – which they have compared to the Munich agreement that appeased Nazi Germany – marks a significant foreign policy defeat for Netanyahu and Israel .
A potential casualty of the deal , in a context of the already difficult relationship between Obama and Netanyahu , could be the renewed US efforts to kickstart the Israel - Palestinian peace process – an area in which Netanyahu has long shown himself reluctant to make any meaningful movement .
Sunni and Shia divide
Fuelled in part by the conflict in Syria , the upheavals in the region since the Arab spring have seen growing tension and violence along the fault lines of the Sunni - Shia divide , not least in Shia majority Iraq which has seen sectarian violence growing month by month in the last year .
In Bahrain and Lebanon sectarian tensions have also been rising .
America and the Middle East
After the long military engagement in Iraq , US participation in the fall of Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi and accusations of a muddled and uncertain response to events in both Egypt and Syria , the interim deal is the first real suggestion that President Barack Obama intends to make a mark on the foreign policy front in the Middle East .
Having spoken early in his presidency of his preparedness to speak to America 's enemies , the tentative breakthrough with Iran – not least in the face of opposition by Israel and Saudi Arabia – suggests a willingness to take risks that has long been absent .
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Saudi - US relations have been frayed for some time .
Points of friction have included Saudi 's irritation over the US attitude towards the Muslim Brotherhood – which it detests – when the Brotherhood was in power in Egypt , and over its fears that any deal with Iran might lead to the resurgence of the world 's most important Shia state .
Since the advent of the Arab spring , Saudi Arabia has positioned itself aggressively in the worsening Shia - Sunni sectarian divide , helping to prop up minority Sunni rule in Bahrain and backing Sunni jihadis fighting in Syria against the Assad regime .
Iran
The interim six - month deal envisages sanctions relief to Iran to the tune of $ 7bn , opening the way for a long - term deal worth exponentially more .
The hope of the Obama administration is that by demonstrating that there are solid economic rewards for Iran in co - operating with international demands over its nuclear programme , it will cement the more moderate government of Hassan Rouhani ( above ) after the rejection by voters of the policies of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Iranian negotiators have warned , however , that because of continuing competition among hardliners and more moderate strands in Iranian politics hardliners could be resurgent without noticeable benefits to Iran .
A fuller international engagement with Iran is also seen by many observers as a prerequisite to negotiating an end to the conflict in Syria .
Tehran supports the Assad regime , concerned – for its own part – over what it sees as the emergence of an increasingly Sunni jihadist influence over those fighting the regime , backed by individuals in rival Saudi Arabia and the Gulf ."
2014-01-07,"A four - member parliamentary delegation from the UK has travelled to Tehran in the first such visit to Iran in five years as long - strained bilateral ties improve under the administration of President Hassan Rouhani .
Members of the all - party parliamentary group on Iran , led by the former foreign secretary Jack Straw , arrived in Tehran on Tuesday after being invited by their counterparts in the Iranian parliament , the Majlis .
They plan to meet senior Iranian officials and hope to arrange a reciprocal visit to London by Iranian MPs .
The visit comes a month after Britain 's newly appointed chargé d'affaires , Ajay Sharma , travelled to Iran in a first diplomatic visit by a UK envoy since London withdrew all staff from Tehran after the storming of its embassy in 2011 .
Although embassies still remain closed in their respective capitals , Britain and Iran have upgraded ties and taken significant steps towards reopening their missions since Rouhani took office .
David Cameron and Rouhani also spoke on the phone in November in the first direct contact between a British prime minister and an Iranian president in a decade .
Straw 's office in London said on Monday that the group visiting Iran also consisted of Ben Wallace , the Conservative MP who is a co - chairman of the Britain - Iran parliamentary friendship group , as well as the former chancellor of the exchequer Lord Lamont , and the Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn . ""
The trip is being supported by the UK branch of the Inter - Parliamentary Union [ IPU ] , and is being made on a reciprocal basis , "" a statement from Jack Straw 's office said .
"" It is hoped that whilst in Tehran the group will be able to make arrangements for a return delegation from the Majlis to visit the UK . ""
Iran 's state - run Irna news agency quoted Hamed Qader – Marzi , of the Majlis 's Iran - Britain parliamentary group , as saying that the UK parliamentarians were due to meet the speaker of Iran 's parliament , Ali Larijani , and the foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif .
They are scheduled to spend two days in Tehran and will make brief visits to Isfahan and Shiraz , according to the local media .
They are due to return to the UK on Friday .
A Foreign Office spokesperson said : "" We are aware of Jack Straw MP 's forthcoming visit to Iran .
This is not a UK government visit .
Mr Straw is visiting with members of the all - party parliamentary group on Iran . ""
Straw 's office said the Foreign Office had been "" very helpful "" in facilitating the visit .
Iranian hardliners , who have a deep suspicion of British politicians in general and have often accused London of meddling in the country 's internal affairs , are nervous about the UK MPs ' visit .
They are particularly concerned because a similar visit last month by five members of the European parliament prompted anger among Iranian lawmakers when MEPs visited two prominent Iranian opposition activists : human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and celebrated film - maker Jafar Panahi .
Tarja Cronberg , the chair of the EU parliamentary Iran delegation , said that MEPs met the two figures on the first day of their visit to Tehran , in which they discussed the situation of human rights in the Islamic republic .
Iranian MPs later condemned that meeting and reprimanded security authorities for their failure to stop that to happen .
Assuring hardliners , a senior Iranian MP , Shahin Mohammad Sadeghi , said on Sunday that the Iranian parliament had set pre - conditions for the British MPs and their programme in Iran had been scheduled in co - ordination with the Iranian authorities .
"" We have to make sure that this visit does n't create any controversies , "" he said , according to the semi - official Mehr news agency .
Following Sharma 's visit to Iran , his counterpart , Mohammad - Hassan Habibollahzadeh , also visited London .
On the Iranian visit to London , an Foreign Office spokesperson said : "" The chargé d'affaires , Mr Ajay Sharma , was pleased to welcome Mr Habibollahzadeh to the Foreign Office on 13 December .
They had a productive meeting and continued the detailed discussions that were started in Tehran on improving UK - Iran bilateral relations on a step by step and reciprocal basis .
The chargé will return to Tehran in January where he will build on positive talks and deliver concrete results for the benefit of the UK and Iran .
"" We remain clear we will not have a diplomatic presence in Tehran until we have confidence that Iran will abide by its obligations to protect our staff and that our mission would be allowed to carry out its normal functions . """
2014-01-20,"As President Hassan Rouhani shows intentions to establish better relations with the international community , it is in the EU 's interests to formulate a comprehensive and up - to - date Iran strategy .
After the adoption of the joint action plan on Iran 's nuclear programme in Geneva in November 2013 , the policy - makers in Tehran have received a growing number of high - level visitors from Europe , including the recent delegation of the British parliamentarians .
I have myself led a delegation to Iran from the European parliament in December , the first meeting of its kind for six years .
My personal impression of this visit is that the protracted period of silence is now being replaced by a plethora of voices on both sides .
Expectations rise with every high - level meeting but a strategy on how to build a constructive relationship has yet to emerge .
Europe should be concerned with the lack of a strategy towards Iran .
In recent years the bulk of European interaction has been via the international nuclear talks of the EU3+E group where the UK , France , and Germany are members and the EU foreign policy chief , Baroness Ashton , has a role as chair .
Although a very important and extremely challenging process , it has not required a bilateral engagement with the Iranian leadership on a wide range of other issues .
Baroness Ashton has been consistently impartial as a chair of the negotiating group so as not to give the impression of the EU having a special relationship with Iran and to maintain unity between all the negotiating powers .
While this strategy has worked to nail down the agreement at Geneva , which France , for example , initially opposed , it is clearly not enough for the future when the nuclear dossier might be closing .
It is time that the EU overhauls its objectives and options towards Iran .
While other world powers such as Russia or China have strong bilateral channels with Iran , the EU does not even have a diplomatic representation .
The European policy debate on Iran remains patchy .
It is not nearly as consistent or clearly articulated as , for example , the US debate on Iran .
This might come as an opportunity for the EU .
Whereas the US debate seems to be caught in the perennial squabble between Congress and the Obama administration , the European context provides more openness for a comprehensive discourse .
The Europeans should have a vigorous discussion in a multitude of fora what kind of relationship between the EU and Iran would be most desirable .
A strategic European vision towards Iran has yet to emerge .
This vision could be based on three elements .
First , there should be an understanding that engagement with the society of a country is the best way to secure cooperative relationship .
There has been notoriously little exchange between the EU and Iran and even a very gradual increase in cultural , educational , and social exchanges will have a great positive effect .
The Iranian people have a very strong interest towards Europe as well vice versa .
The EU should find the instruments and resources to turn this mutual interest into lasting human ties .
Secondly , a direct dialogue with the leadership on all issues including the most sensitive ones is the most productive way to improve understanding .
In the EU 's Iran strategy , establishing a dialogue on human rights should be the most important objective .
Here , the EU special representative for human rights could play a unique role of an emissary to talk to various branches of Iran 's administration including the judiciary .
Thirdly , the EU should strive to nudge Iran to normalise its relations with the international community on a wide array of issues .
Expanding economic ties , adopting global trade norms and rules , and developing innovative projects such as renewable energy and environmental protection could be very helpful .
The EU should not rush into a cosy partnership with Iran based on the assumption that all the problems will be resolved by the success at Geneva and Rouhani 's new diplomacy .
But putting the task off until the moment when there are no problems left would not work either .
Ultimately , the right moment will arrive only and when the EU considers it to be so .
That is why the EU should start thinking now so it can act strategically and timely .
It may very well need to , and soon .

2014-01-23,"Iran 's president has urged the rest of the world to stop treating his country as pariah state , and said a deal over its nuclear programme would pave the way for the oil - rich nation to become the next big emerging market .
In an olive branch to the international community , Hassan Rouhani told a packed conference hall at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he wanted to end the standoff with the west along with the sanctions that have crippled the economy . ""
Come and visit Iran to see the investment opportunities , "" he said .
The deep freeze in Iranian and US relations has thawed in recent months and Rouhani insisted the country had no intention of using its nuclear technology as weapons , but would invest in nuclear for peaceful purposes . ""
Nuclear weapons have no place in our security strategy and Iran has no motivation to move in that direction , "" Rouhani said , in an address designed to show that Iran wanted to end its diplomatic isolation and fulfil its economic potential .
Calling for relations with Europe to be "" normalised "" , he said Iran could become a "" top 10 "" economy .
Sanctions – such as those that have cut $ 1bn a day off its oil production since 2012 – serve to "" exacerbate divergence "" , Rouhani said .
"" I view Iran 's economy as the most congruent , capable and most closest to successful emerging economies and I envisage Iran 's place alongside them in the future , "" Rouhani said .
He talked of "" constructive engagement "" with the world and "" active foreign policy "" to achieve his economic goals .
When asked by Klaus Schwab , the head of the WEF , if this meant good relations with all countries , Rouhani said that it was with countries "" we officially recognise "" .
Israel 's prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , later dismissed Rouhani 's speech , telling the WEF that these were a "" change in words and unchanging deeds "" .
Arab countries , Netanyahu said , "" understand that Iran remains aggressive , supports terror , that it participates in the slaughter in Syria , [ and ] that is pursuing the development of ballistic missile and plutonium for nuclear weapons "" .
Netanyahu is in Davos with the Israeli president Shimon Perez to encourage investment into the country 's technology hubs .
Rouhani stressed he had been democratically elected last year and referred to the uprisings in the Middle East , saying that culture and spirituality were also needed .
"" Economic factors alone are not enough to provide a better world for people , "" he said .
He said it was "" possible to replace suicidal hopelessness with hope in the future "" , and added : "" The security of world is intertwined with the security of the Middle East . ""
He revealed he had met leaders of leading oil firms on Thursday morning in Davos – thought to be Eni , BP , Total and Shell – to discuss energy security ."
2014-02-04,"The government will this week be served with a claim of up to £ 1bn in damages from an Iranian bank that has been banned from trading with the UK for nearly five years – despite a court ruling that ordered the lifting of sanctions .
Lawyers for Bank Mellat , which had been accused under the Terrorism Act 2000 of funding Iran 's nuclear programme , are bringing the action in the commercial court in London .
The challenge will test enforcement of the commercial embargo against the newly elected president , Hassan Rouhani , as tension between the west and Iran is easing and direct talks have opened up the possibility of restoring normal diplomatic relations .
The claim , brought by Zaiwalla and Co in London on behalf of Bank Mellat , will ask for compensation to restore the bank to the financial position it would have enjoyed had the business restrictions not been imposed in 2009 .
Lawyers claim the money lost is estimated to be as much as £ 1bn .
Sanctions against Bank Mellat were overturned by a supreme court judgment this summer – following the first hearing to be conducted partially in secret – but have still not been repealed .
The Treasury has applied to intervene alongside the European Union at the European court of justice in Luxembourg in favour of upholding sanctions .
Pending that appeal the UK is refusing to withdraw the ban .
In a letter to the attorney general , Dominic Grieve QC , the solicitor acting for Bank Mellat , Sarosh Zaiwalla , urged the UK government to enforce the decision made by the supreme court .
He wrote : "" The supreme court is the highest court of the UK and the British government is obliged to honour its decision , both in letter and spirit …
The supreme court decision showed the world that British justice is independent and now we need to make a collective show to the world that the British government acts in accordance with the principle of rule of law , regardless of any political exigencies . ""
During the hearing the Treasury alleged that the Tehran - based bank financed firms involved in Iran 's nuclear programme and that it was under the control of the Iranian government .
The supreme court ruled last summer that the sanctions were illegal because Bank Mellat received no notice of the intention to impose them and was therefore denied the opportunity to oppose them .
Bank Mellat is the only Iranian bank singled out for UK sanctions .
Last autumn the new Rouhani administration ushered in a more moderate era .
Iran and six world powers , including the UK , struck a landmark deal in Geneva under which Tehran agreed to roll back its nuclear programme and accept more scrutiny of its activities in exchange for partial relief from sanctions .
In January , both sides made the first step in implementing the interim deal with the Iranian scientists halting all enrichment of uranium to 20 % inside the country .
The EU immediately reciprocated to the Iranian gesture by announcing moves to ease restrictions on trade in petrochemicals , precious metals and on the provision of insurance for oil shipments .
This week , the US released $ 550 m to Iran , the first instalment in $ 4.2bn worth of frozen oil revenues which the Islamic republic is expected to receive over a period of time as part of the Geneva deal .
Iran and the world 's major powers have announced they will continue talks on 18 February in Vienna over a comprehensive accord which is aimed at settling the decades - long dispute over Tehran 's nuclear activities and the complete lifting of the nuclear - related sanctions .
But those talks are threatened by hardliners both in the US and Iran – a significant number of senators want more sanctions while hawks in Iran criticise Rouhani for agreeing to the interim deal .
The US president , Barack Obama , however , has said he will veto any new sanctions bill as long as talks have not failed .
Iran 's nuclear dispute heightened under Rouhani 's predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , when the US and EU imposed the toughest punitive measures against Tehran since the 1979 Islamic revolution , severing all financial ties with Iranian banks and putting an embargo on the imports of Iranian oil .
Sanctions compounded the country 's economic woes , sending the national currency tailspinning in the beginning of 2012 , which increased inflation to record highs .
Under the sanctions regime , the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iranian patients with serious illnesses were put at risk as an unintentional consequence of sanctions caused dire shortages of life - saving medicines such as chemotherapy drugs for cancer and bloodclotting agents for haemophiliacs .
Rouhani , who came to power on promises of moderation and improved relations with the west , has described sanctions as cruel .
A significant number of opposition figures in Iran have also made clear that they , too , deem sanctions "" crippling "" and have warned against their "" devastating effects "" .
Last August , a group of prominent Iranian political prisoners wrote to Obama , complaining that blanket sanctions were punishing people , urging him to stop them ."
2014-02-05,"Iran 's health ministry has set up a committee to investigate whether the state 's jamming of satellite signals could pose a health risk to citizens .
Foreign - based TV channels have been blocked for years in Iran , and there are growing fears that the equipment used could cause cancer .
The minister for health and medical education , Hassan Hashemi , told the state news agency Irna on Tuesday that the president , Hassan Rouhani , had asked officials to study whether jamming TV signals could pose a health risk . ""
The committee 's experts team include representatives from the communications ministry as well as the country 's atomic energy organisation and other relevant departments , "" he said .
"" They have total freedom in their investigation and if they find out any issues , they will announce them . ""
The initial reports show that jamming signals pose no physical harm but the committee needs to carry out its investigation thoroughly .
Rumours are widespread about jamming 's effects and consequences on people 's health but most of the rumours have no scientific basis . ""
Although satellite receiving dishes are illegal , millions of Iranians watch satellite channels to keep up with programmes that are often banned on the state - run television , such as singing competitions or western music videos .
Police often mount raids on apartment blocks to find and destroy satellite dishes , but Rouhani has taken a softer line .
Shortly after he was elected as president last year , he made clear that he opposed harsh crackdowns by the police . ""
In the age of digital revolution , one can not live or govern in a quarantine , "" he said .
But a decision on whether the ban should be lifted is not solely in the hands of the government .
The elite Revolutionary Guards , close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and its Basij voluntary militia are particularly worried about people 's unrestricted access to foreign channels .
The authorities often step up the jamming at times of political unrest or internal bickerings .
In the aftermath of the disputed elections in 2009 , when millions of Iranians poured on to streets in protest at the results , Iran extensively jammed news channels such as BBC 's Persian service and Voice of America 's Persian network .
Hashemi , an ophthalmologist , was appointed as health minister by Rouhani in August .
His appointment was hailed by doctors and experts who see him as someone with a realistic approach to Iran 's health problems .
In December , Hashemi complained about the taboo surrounding people with HIV in Iran and said the number of people infected with the disease had dramatically increased ."
2014-02-06,"Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , has promised healthcare for all Iranians in the next four years in a move reminiscent of Barack Obama 's patient protection and affordable care act , dubbed Obamacare .
In an interview broadcast live on national television on Wednesday , Rouhani said he wanted all Iranians to be protected under a nationwide health insurance programme .
He said at least five million citizens who are the most vulnerable will be the first people to benefit from the initiative .
Rouhani 's official English - language Twitter account was the first to make a link between the Iranian president 's plan and that initiated by his US counterpart .
The government "" will extend medical insurance to all Iranians .
First step will be to cover 5mn uninsured Iranians by the social safety net # RouhaniCare , "" read the president 's tweet .
"" Our people face a number of difficulties in their health protection and when they enter a state - run hospital they usually have to obtain their medicine , tests and medical equipment from other places , "" Rouhani said in the interview .
"" We have to make sure our hospitals can give people all the services they need so that they are not left confused . ""
The Iranian president said his healthcare plan would be partly funded by cuts to government subsidies .
Other Obama - related gestures have also inspired the Iranian president and his supporters .
A music clip released on the internet in November and endorsed by Rouhani reminded many of Obama 's 2008 campaign video
Yes We Can .
Rouhani 's interview , initially scheduled right after the 9 pm news bulletin , was broadcast with an hour 's delay after an apparent row between the broadcaster and the president 's office over who could interview him .
The head of Iran 's national broadcaster , IRIB , implied later that Rouhani had handpicked the two interviewers who questioned him .
When the president failed to address the nation on schedule a news ticker announced delays due to technical problems .
Rouhani 's Twitter account reacted immediately by blaming IRIB 's head , Ezatollah Zarghami , saying he had prevented the live broadcast . ""
Head of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting , Zarghami , prevented live discussion w/
people on # IRIB1 which was scheduled for an hour ago "" , read a tweet .
The government 's official news agency , IRNA , also blamed Zarghami , saying he had prevented the broadcast for unknown reasons .
When Rouhani finally appeared in front of cameras , he apologised for the delay but refused to clarify what had happened backstage .
In a letter to the IRIB 's watchdog , Zarghami asked whether the head of the government could select his own interviewers , implying that was what had stirred the row .
The dispute dominated Thursday 's front pages in Tehran .
In his late - night interview , Rouhani apologised to Iranians for his government 's failure in distributing food rations , known as commodity baskets , to people .
IRIB is independent of the Iranian government and its head is appointed directly by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
It is the only legal TV and radio broadcaster inside the country but millions of Iranians watch foreign - based channels via illegal satellite dishes on rooftops .
IRIB is close to the country 's conservative political faction , especially the elite revolutionary guards .
Questions posed to the president on the national TV are usually not controversial and rarely challenge him ."
2014-02-11,"Opposition inside Iran to the interim nuclear agreement between the administration of Hassan Rouhani and six world powers has gathered strength after the Iranian president labelled his domestic critics "" a bunch of uneducated people "" .
As hundreds of thousands of Iranians rallied across the country to mark the 35th anniversary of the Islamic revolution on Tuesday , Rouhani 's critics distributed leaflets asking whether his government had made too many concessions in the Geneva negotiations last year . ""
Did you know that all sanctions imposed by the UN security council , the European Union and the US will remain in place despite the agreement ? "" reads one of the leaflets .
It makes several claims that are untrue , including that economic sanctions and oil embargo will not be lifted even if Iran settles its nuclear dispute with the west .
Another asks : "" In the final stage of the negotiations , did you know that only nuclear - related sanctions will be removed and not main punitive measures such as banking and oil sanctions ? ""
Last week Rouhani urged university professors and elites to publicly support his diplomacy .
"" Why is the university silent ?
Why are the professors silent ?
What are you afraid of ?
"" the president said , according to quotes carried by the conservative YJC news agency .
"" Why should only a small number of people talk ?
Why must there be a bunch of uneducated people doing all the talk while our university professors talk in private ?
Why do n't you step forward ?
The future will not forgive us for this . ""
The fiery speech was met with criticism among Rouhani 's own supporters , some of whom said the language was inappropriate and echoed that of his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The semi - official Isna news agency reported that a statement issued by "" the people 's movement for defending Iran 's independence "" alleged there was a secret agreement between Iran 's foreign ministry and the US and EU .
Rouhani 's government has vehemently denied claims about a secret agreement parallel to the interim deal .
It was not immediately clear which political group in Iran was behind the leaflets , but much of the criticism of Rouhani 's nuclear diplomacy in recent months has come from supporters of the former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili .
Jalili , a hardliner who negotiated with the west under Ahmadinejad , ran against Rouhani in last year 's presidential elections but performed poorly .
As part of the Geneva deal , Tehran agreed to roll back its nuclear programme and accept more scrutiny of its activities , in exchange for partial relief from sanctions .
Last month both sides made the first step in implementing the interim deal , with Iranian scientists halting all enrichment of uranium to 20 % concentration .
In return , the EU eased restrictions on trade in petrochemicals , precious metals and on the provision of insurance for oil shipments .
The US treasury released $ 550 m ( £ 335 m ) to Iran , the first instalment in $ 4.2bn of frozen oil revenues that the Islamic republic is expected to receive as part of the deal .
Conservatives who have dominated the Iranian parliament have voiced opposition to the agreement and criticised the government for not involving them directly in the negotiations .
But an apparent blessing for the six - month agreement from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say on all state matters , has limited their room to attack Rouhani .
In a speech aired live on national television last week , Rouhani defended the interim agreement once more , prompting some MPs to ask the broadcaster to give them airtime to respond .
A number of placards carried by people in Tuesday 's demonstrations displayed similar messages to those of the leaflets .
"" We promise to open our eyes in the next elections , "" read one , according to images posted on Twitter . ""
Centrifuges spin no more , but for what price ?
A basket of food ?
"" read another , referring to Rouhani 's initiative for distribution of food rations among people .
"" We uneducated people who have obtained our nuclear energy by sacrificing our blood will not change it with a piece of bread , "" said another placard .
"" I 'm uneducated but I will not accept tyranny .
"" Some participants in the rallies also shouted "" death to America "" and set fire to the US and union flags , local agencies said .
Some carried placards reading "" we are eager for the options on the table "" , referring to comments made by US officials in the past that all options were on the table about the future of Iran 's nuclear activities .
Rouhani has stood firm over the agreement so far .
In his speech , he said : "" I say explicitly to those delusional people who say the military option is on the table , that they should change their glasses …
Our nation regards the language of threat as rude and offensive . ""
He added : "" I want to expressly announce that the movement of the Iranian nation towards the peaks of scientific and technical progress and advancement , including peaceful nuclear technology , will be forever . ""
The next round of talks between Iran and Britain , France , Germany , China , Russia and the US – the group known as P5 + 1 – over a comprehensive accord is scheduled for 18 February in Vienna ."
2014-02-28,"“
Those who are constantly creating rifts do not know what kind of burden we carry .
”
These words , uttered by President Hassan Rouhani in the midst of a publicity tour of Iran ’s provinces , sum up the political temperature inside the country after the centrist administration ’s first six months in office .
Despite pivotal breakthroughs in international negotiations , Rouhani faces increasing pressure on the domestic front as he balances the concerns of a rigid conservative camp against the grievances of voters grappling with sociocultural restrictions , unemployment and downward social mobility .
“
In domestic politics , what has changed ?
Did anything get cheaper ?
Did the inflation rate drop ?
Have the jobless returned to work ?
” asks 48-year - old former business owner Hossein , who joined Tehran ’s ever - expanding legion of gypsy cab drivers after his factory went bankrupt during the sanctions - plagued administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
“
Lifting the sanctions should make the situation better , but when [ Mr Rouhani ] wanted to be president , he promised a total transformation in the first 100 days .
Now , it ’s as if he had n’t said anything .
”
Even as Rouhani pushes for economic development in critical areas like petrochemicals , the automotive industry and shipping lines - all of which are slated for liberation from international sanctions as the nuclear talks with the United States and the European Union advance - his supporters are growing impatient with the lack of progress on job creation and inflation control .
The Iranian economy shrank 2 % in the past six months , according to official statistics , and consumer prices have increased 5.6 % since Rouhani ’s inauguration last August .
After a routine visit to Tehran earlier this month , the International Monetary Fund warned that without “ reforms to promote stability , investment and productivity , ” Iran would continue to struggle with the “ large shocks ” that have impeded its stability and growth in past years .
Recognising the ever - increasing financial strain on Iranian households , the government has tried to aid some of the country ’s neediest through subsidies and breadlines , but some of these efforts have ended in near - fiasco due to the large volume of applicants .
In an economy where the average urban family must spend 23.8 % more than it did a year ago to maintain the same standard of living , the people lining up for government handouts are not just the abjectly poor and the unemployed , but also labourers and civil servants whose monthly salaries fall well below the national average of $ 500 .
Last month , the government announced that it had earmarked 13 trillion Rials ( $ 433 million ) for food baskets intended for poor households , but the swelling numbers of those who considered themselves eligible created an administrative nightmare , earning Rouhani criticism both from conservative MPs and impoverished citizens who questioned the fairness of the system through which the aid was disbursed .
Among the rejected applicants was 55-year old Mohammad , a custodian at Tehran ’s Mehrabad Airport .
Mohammad says his salary amounts to $ 310 - barely enough to feed a family in a city where the average monthly cost of living is $ 553 .
“
How can you give the basket to someone who owns a car worth $ 10,000 but not give it to me , with my salary ?
” he asked .
“ Ahmadinejad [ or Rouhani ]
, it does n’t make a difference .
”
The question of social justice under Rouhani is not limited to the economic realm .
Much of the sociocultural restrictions imposed on Iranian citizens under Ahmadinejad remain in place , despite the president ’s pre - election pledge to relax cultural censorship and strengthen personal freedoms .
The Internet remains slow and heavily filtered , and social networking sites are still blocked despite their widespread use by politicians .
The cinema , despite a surge in creativity this year , remains prone to censorship and favouritism to pro - government directors .
At least three newspapers - including the centrist Aseman , which vocally supported the Rouhani administration - have been forced to shut down , while others were banned before they ever hit the newsstands .
Another still - existing publication , the magazine Mehrnameh , is on thin ice after a reprimand for publishing an article that mentioned the Baha’i , a religious sect whose members are persecuted in Iran .
International watchdog groups have also noted a surge in hangings since Rouhani took office , noting that many of those executed were ethnic or religious minorities .
Despite these harrowing social and economic issues , the new administration has proven effective on several key domestic fronts .
Among Rouhani ’s early successes was currency stabilisation .
The plummeting price of the rial , which at its lowest point traded at 40,000 per one US dollar , has been steadied at 29,000 - 30,000 per $ 1 , ending an era of wild speculation and financial uncertainty that undermined international trade .
“
The market has regained a sense of balance , ” says Nadia , 33 , a manager at a logistics firm based in Tehran ’s financial district .
“
That ’s enough of a reason for which to stand up and applaud Rouhani .
”
Another , more recent achievement is the renewed flow of pharmaceuticals to the country , providing relief to the thousands of patients who have been dying due to lack of access to essential drugs and medical equipment after its import was disrupted as a consequence of the financial sanctions on Iran .
Meanwhile , as the government lobbies for the removal of sanctions on key industries , large construction projects for new ports and oil refineries are in the works , promising job creation and economic revitalisation in the provinces .
Yet while the long - term economic perspective seems positive , the new government ’s failings in the social and cultural sphere suggest that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei may be keeping Rouhani on a shorter leash than voters had expected .
The newspaper closings , the ongoing censorship in the arts , and the poor human rights record indicate that while Rouhani may be in favour of a more open Iranian society , his hardline critics remain determined - and able - to block even the slightest attempt at relaxation .
This political reality does not bode well for the Green Movement voters who supported Rouhani in last year ’s presidential race , hoping that electing a centrist figure would address at least some of the concerns they voiced during the bloody protests of 2009 .
With their one - time leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Mousavi facing a fourth year of house arrest , many Green Movement activists now believe that any reform under Rouhani will come in small , moderate doses , if at all .
“
When you ’re experiencing intense pain , you do n’t care about a return to normal - all you want is for the pain to go away , ” said Ali , 29 .
“
And that is what this new government is banking on .

2014-03-01,"Iranâ€ ™ s president said on Saturday the Islamic Republic has decided not to develop nuclear weapons out of principle , not only because it is prevented from doing so by treaties .
President Hassan Rouhani also urged Iranâ€ ™ s military leaders to let diplomacy prevail in dealing with potential foreign threats , in a clear reference to efforts to end the nuclear dispute and decades of hostile relations with the west .
â€œIt is very important to formulate oneâ€ ™ s sentences and speeches in a way that is not construed as threat , intention to strike a blow , â€ �
Rouhani said in a meeting with Iranâ€ ™ s top military echelon .
â€œWe must be very careful in our calculations .
Launching missiles and staging military exercises to scare off the other side is not good deterrence , although a necessity in its proper place , â€ � the official IRNA news agency quoted him as saying .
â€œA misfire could burst into flames and wreak havoc to everything.â€ � While Iranian nuclear negotiators were haggling with world powers in Vienna last month , many generals were beating war drums at home and flexing their military muscles .
â€œOur forefathers primed us for the final epic battle , â€ � said the chief commander of the Revolutionary Guards , Mohammad - Ali Jafari .
Such belligerence was absent from Rouhaniâ€ ™ s speech on Saturday .
The president said that if Iran wanted weapons of mass destruction , it would be easier for it to make chemical or biological weapons .
In doing so he was reiterating a policy set by Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who issued a religious decree banning the production and use of nuclear weapons .
He has said holding such arms is a sin as well as â€œuseless , harmful and dangerousâ€ � .
â€œWe are not after weapons of mass destruction .
Thatâ€ ™ s our red line , â€ �
Rouhani said .
â€œIf Iran was after weapons of mass destruction , it would build chemical weapons .
Those are easier to make .
It would build biological arms , which are even easier than making chemical weapons.â€ �
He said
Iranâ€ ™ s
â€œbeliefsâ€ � and commitment to â€œethical principlesâ€ � , not merely the United Nationsâ€ ™ nuclear non - proliferation treaty , prevent it from making a bomb .
Iran is a signatory to the NPT and says it will remain committed to its obligations not to build nuclear weapons under the treaty but will not compromise on its right to enrich uranium and produce nuclear fuel .
â€œWe signed these treaties to show the world we are not after such weapons , â€ �
Rouhani told military commanders .
â€œEven
if there were no NPT or other treaties , our belief , our faith , our religion and principles tell us not to seek weapons of mass destruction.â€ �
The US and its allies fear that Iran seeks to develop the ability to make a nuclear weapon , should it want one .
Iran denies the charge , saying its nuclear programme is peaceful and geared towards generating electricity and producing radioisotopes to treat cancer patients .
Rouhani said his governmentâ€ ™ s policy of moderation and easing tensions with the outside world is â€œnot a tacticâ€ � but a genuine change in the Islamic Republicâ€ ™ s foreign policy .
â€œThe foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is based on easing tensions and building confidence with the world .
This is not a tactic or slogan .
Iran is not seeking tensions with others â€
¦
but we donâ€ ™
t compromise on our dignity , independence , national interests and values , â€ � he said .
Rouhani says his countrymen elected him president in June to change Iranâ€ ™ s foreign policy and shift away from the bombastic style adopted under his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He has said , however , that its principles including maintaining a peaceful nuclear programme will not change .
That policy , also supported by Khamenei , led to a historic interim nuclear deal with world powers on 24 November , in Geneva .
Iran stopped enriching uranium to 20 % and started neutralising its existing stockpile of that grade just steps away from weapons material in January , in order to fulfil commitments reached under the deal .
The US and the European Union also lifted some sanctions in response to the Iranian moves .
Iran and the six - nation group â€ “ the five permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany â€ “ began talks earlier this month for a comprehensive deal in Vienna ."
2014-03-12,"The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , has sharply rebuked the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , for failing to improve human rights since taking office in August .
Despite "" commendable steps "" under Rouhani , including the release of a limited number of high - profile political prisoners , violations had continued , Ban reports in a new report to the UN human rights council issued on Tuesday .
Execution , arbitrary detention and unfair trials , descrimination against minorities , mistreatment of political prisoners , and restrictions on freedom of expression , are among subjects that remain concerns , according to Ban .
The secretary general said he was particularly concerned about the increased use of capital punishment in Iran . ""
At least 500 persons are known to have been executed in 2013 , including 57 in public .
According to some sources , the figure may be as high as 625 .
Those executed reportedly included 27 women and two children , "" Ban said .
Ahmed Shaheed , the UN special rapporteur for human rights in Iran , said on Wednesday that , in Iran , at least 176 people so far had been put to death this year alone .
Ban complained that Iran had not allowed Shaheed to visit and investigate the abuse claims on the ground .
Ban said : "" The new government has not changed its approach regarding the application of the death penalty and seems to have followed the practice of previous administrations , which relied heavily on the death penalty to combat crime . ""
His report also urged Rouhani to consider the immediate release of the two opposition leaders , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , who have been under house arrest without trial since the aftermath of the 2009 presidential election , won by the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Ban said that at least 80 political prisoners had been released since mid - September , including the prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh , but that many remained in jail . ""
Despite these welcome developments a large number of political prisoners , including high - profile lawyers , human rights activists , women rights activists and journalists , continue to serve sentences for charges that are believed to be linked to the exercise of their freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly . ""
Lawyers including Abdol Fattah Soltani , Mohammad Ali Dadkhah , and Mohammad Seifzadeh , were "" detained solely for exercising their rights to freedoms of expression , association and assembly "" , according to the report .
Ban said that Rouhani 's administration had not made "" any significant improvement in the promotion and protection of freedom of expression and opinion "" despite pledges made by the president during his campaign and after his swearing - in .
At least 35 journalists were also held behind bars , and two newspapers had been shut down recently .
"" Both offline and online outlets continue to face restrictions including closure , "" the secretary general said .
On freedom of belief , he warned : "" Religious minorities such as Baha'ís and Christians face violations entrenched in law and in practice .
Harassment , home raids and incitement to hatred , are reportedly commonly applied by the authorities to suppress the Baha'i community . ""
Apart from Ban , the EU foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , has also raised concerns about the situation of human rights in Iran .
Ashton infuriated Iranian hardliners when she met a number of women 's rights activists during a recent visit to Tehran .
On Wednesday Ashton 's meeting was still creating ripples in Iran , with the head of the judiciary and parliament condemning it ."
2014-03-27,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , described Afghanistan as an occupied nation while in Kabul to celebrate the Persian new year on Thursday , saying Soviet and Nato forces had brought violence and extremism to the country .
Relations with the west have warmed slightly since Rouhani took office , but Iran has always been unhappy about having a US presence on its doorstep and is strongly opposed to a draft security agreement that would keep US troops in Afghanistan for another decade .
Rouhani did not refer directly to the US or Nato , whose troops have been fighting on Afghan soil for over a decade , but his comments about "" two occupations "" left little room for doubt .
Soviet forces arrived in Afghanistan in 1979 and stayed for a decade of escalating conflict .
US and Nato troops helped topple the Taliban government in 2001 , and have remained in the country to fight a spreading insurgency ever since . ""
[ The occupations ] brought the unfortunate seed of violence , which has damaged the lives of people and this country , "" Rouhani said , adding that decades of war had also introduced extremists to Afghanistan . ""
My country , the Islamic Republic of Iran , has condemned both occupations and has helped the people of Afghanistan in both periods of time , "" the Associated Press quoted him as saying at a day of celebrations at the presidential palace in Kabul that were also attended by the presidents of Tajikistan and Pakistan .
Tehran has poured millions of dollars ' worth into direct support for the Afghan government and networks of soft - power projects from schools to mosques and media outlets .
It has also reportedly established ties with the Taliban , though relations with the hardline Sunni group were poor when they ruled the country .
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has warned US forces in the past that heavy - handed military tactics risk making Afghans see them as occupiers , but never gone as far as Rouhani .
Foreign combat forces are due to leave the country by the end of this year , but if the bilateral security agreement is signed , a few thousand troops will stay on to train Afghan soldiers and hunt down militants from al - Qaida and asscociated groups along the border with Pakistan .
Karzai has refused to sign the agreement , but he will step down this year , with elections due to take place on 5 April to choose a successor .
All the main candidates to replace him say they would finalise the pact soon after taking office ."
2014-04-08,"Iran defended its nomination for ambassador to the United Nations on Tuesday , after hawks in the US Senate passed legislation to ban the official from entering the country over his alleged role in the 1979 hostage crisis .
The dispute over Hamid Aboutalebi , Tehran ’s pick as its envoy to the UN in New York , threatens to derail talks over Iran ’s nuclear program , which are entering a critical phase in Vienna .
Aboutalebi , a close political adviser to the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani , has served as Iran 's ambassador to Belgium , Italy , Australia and the European Union .
He has denied direct participation in the seizure of the America ’s embassy in Tehran more than three decades ago , which resulted in 52 Americans being held hostage for 444 days .
He has reportedly insisted that his involvement in the group Muslim Students Following the Imam 's Line , which occupied the embassy , was limited to translation and negotiation .
However , senior US lawmakers who accuse Aboutalebi of involvement in the siege are rallying round legislation to prevent him access to UN headquarters .
On Tuesday , in the wake of the Senate 's endorsement of a bill that effectively targeted Aboutalebi , and as a new round of nuclear negotiations was getting under way in Vienna , Iran stood by its nomination .
“
In our viewpoint , the ambassador who has been introduced is qualified for the position and has had important diplomatic posts in European countries and Australia , and has had a good , effective and positive performance during his past [ diplomatic ] missions , ” Iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham told reporters , according to state TV .
Legislation authored by Republican senator Ted Cruz easily passed the Senate on Monday , after it received the backing of Democratic hawks such as Chuck Schumer .
Cruz , a standard - bearer of the right wing of the GOP , called Iran ’s nomination a “ deliberate and unambiguous insult to the United States ” .
“
Given the larger strategic threats to the United States and our allies , represented by Iran ’s nuclear ambitions , this is not the moment for diplomatic niceties , ” Cruz said .
If put to the vote in the House , the bill is likely be supported by in the second chamber , however any visa ban on Aboutalebi would require the executive branch .
The White House appeared to harden it stance on Tuesday in the wake of the Senate vote .
Press secretary Jay Carney said : "" We ’ve informed the government of Iran that this potential selection is not viable "" .
The language was the closest the administration has come to ruling out Aboutalebi being allowed into the country to fulfil a UN role .
The Obama administration has described Aboutalebi ’s appointment as “ extremely troubling ” , but has so far stopped short of saying he should be barred from the US .
Protocol dictates that the US accept UN diplomatic staff and foreign leaders , even from its adversaries , although Washington insists there are exceptions to the rule .
The controversy comes at a critical juncture of the nuclear negotiations , which are resuming between Iran and six world powers , led by the US .
On the eve of the talks , scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday , Iranian foreign minister Mohamad Javad Zarif said negotiators would specifically address the text of an agreement – a task he called “ the difficult part ” of discussions .
In previous rounds of talks , which are taking place against the backdrop of an interim agreement under which Iran froze some nuclear enrichment operations in return for limited sanctions relief , negotiators have held back from debating any specific text .
“
Probably at the beginning of preparing the draft , the differences will be lots , ” Zarif told Iran 's state - run television .
The US has given a slightly different timeframe .
A senior administration official involved in the talks , who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity , said that drafting actual text was not due to begin until May , with all sides until then involved in clarifying technical issues .
The official compared the talks to a Rubik ’s cube , “ where [ making ] progress on one element may mean there ’s more trade space on another element ” .
Both sides are under pressure from hardliners in Tehran and Washington , who are deeply sceptical the talks will yield a satisfactory deal .
The clock is ticking , with both sides committed to achieving a comprehensive deal by 20 July .
Desperate to seize what it believes is a unique window for an agreement , the White House dissuaded critics in the Senate from introducing a bill that would impose new sanctions against Iran , a move it said could sabotage the talks .
But has been unable to defuse the growing row over Aboutalebi 's appointment .
Administration officials are angry Rouhani heightened tensions by appointing Aboutalebi , but also anxious the controversy does not escalate in Washington and undermine support for negotiations .
The dispute over Aboutalebi 's appointment has been widely reported in the Iranian media , too .
Iran considers its UN ambassador a prominent figure , often appearing on foreign - based TV channels representing the views of the Islamic republic .
The 1979 hostage crisis remains a fraught memory for both Iran and the US .
Young Iranians involved in the seizure of the embassy , and American diplomats held hostage , have gone on to hold senior positions in their respective governments .
There were conflicting reports from Tehran and Washington about diplomatic discussions over Aboutalebi ’s nomination .
Last week Marie Harf , deputy press secretary for the State Department , was non - committal over whether Aboutalebi would receive a visa .
She added : “ We ’ve raised our serious concerns about this possible nomination with the government of Iran .
I ’m not going to get into specifically how we ’ve done that , but we have done that .
”
That account was disputed in Tehran on Tuesday by Afkham , who indicated Iran has still not heard formally from Washington .
"" We think the process is running its diplomatic course and until we receive a formal response from official channels , we do not consider the matter finished , "" she said ."
2014-04-09,"The chief of Iran 's judiciary has accused the EU of spreading homosexuality and promiscuity in the country after the European parliament warned human rights abuses have continued under Hassan Rouhani 's new administration .
Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani , who heads the Islamic Republic 's powerful judicial system , defended Tehran 's record on human rights on Wednesday , denying it had executed juveniles or imprisoned Bahá'í citizens on the basis of their religious faith .
To the dismay of Iranian leaders , the European parliament passed a resolution last week which condemned "" continued , systematic violation of fundamental rights "" in Iran and urged diplomats to put a spotlight on human rights in their negotiations with the Islamic republic .
Iran has reacted angrily to the declaration , with its foreign ministry describing it as "" unfounded and unacceptable "" .
Last month , the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , made similar accusations , saying Rouhani had done too little to improve rights situation in Iran since taking office as the new president .
Larijani said the resolution was one - sided , counted as interfering in Iran 's internal affairs and showed the arrogance of the Europeans towards his country . ""
The resolution is worthless and is not worth attention , but it showed the arrogant nature of the westerners under such conditions that they claim serious negotiations with the Islamic republic of Iran , "" Larijani told judges and senior judiciary officials , according to the semi - official Fars news agency . ""
Unfortunately , the Europeans still repeat their cheap remarks against the Iranian people and government and do n't pay attention to the documented responses given to them ; they have raised one - sided claims in the recent resolution without paying attention to the repeated responses given to them by the Islamic Republic officials .
"" The resolution particularly infuriated Iranians because it criticised the presidential election that gave Rouhani victory last year , saying it was "" not held in accordance with the democratic standards valued by the EU "" .
The European parliament 's resolution highlighted restrictions on freedom of speech in Iran , including the continued closure of the association of Iranian journalists , and condemned "" the repression and discrimination on the basis of religion , belief , ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation that persist "" .
It mentioned the situation of Bahá'ís , who are in the words of the UN 's special rapporteur on Iran , Ahmed Shaheed , "" the most persecuted religious community "" in Iran .
Bahá'ís are deprived of many rights such as access to education or the right to own a business , and are often persecuted for their beliefs .
According to the Bahá'í International Community , some 136 Bahá'ís are currently behind bars in Iran on the grounds of their religious beliefs .
Those in jail include the Bahá'í couple Faran Hesami and Kamran Rahimian who have been locked up for the past year and half , away from their four - year - old son , Artin Rahimian , who is now being brought up by relatives .
The husband and wife were apparently arrested for providing education to other members of the Bahá'í community in Iran who are not allowed to attend university because of their religious affiliation .
Seven leaders of the Bahá'í community have also been in prison for the past six years , each serving 20-year jail sentences .
Larijani said : "" The Bahá'í faith is made up by the west to interfere with the Muslim countries but despite this no Bahá'í is persecuted in Iran just for being Bahá'í . ""
The judiciary chief said those in prison are convicted of espionage or national security charges .
Iran often arrests ordinary Bahá'ís or members of its opposition on vague charges of acting against national security or spreading propaganda against the ruling system .
The ayatollah said : "" They [ the Europeans ] want to normalise promiscuity and forcing homosexuality on us but these behaviours are not compatible with human [ nature ] and Islamic lifestyle . ""
Two of Larijani 's siblings are also powerful figures in the Iranian ruling system .
Ali Larijani is the speaker of the parliament and Mohammad Javad Larijani is the secretary - general of the Iranian high council for human rights who often finds himself defending the actions taken under his brother 's judiciary system .
On the issue of juvenile executions , documented by human rights groups such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch , Larijani said these had never happened in the Islamic republic . ""
In the Islamic Republic , we absolutely have no execution of people under the age of 18 and it 's a blatant lie by the European parliament . ""
Tarja Cronberg , a member of the European parliament 's foreign affairs committee who is also the chair of the EU Iran delegation , has defended the resolution . ""
The resolution adopted provides a good basis for further dialogue between the EU and Iran .
It contains constructive elements which Iran itself has deemed important , including partial sanctions relief , co - operation to combat drug trafficking and terrorism , as well as improving trade relations and expanding exchanges with Europe , "" she said .
"" A European parliament resolution is always a compromise and an outcome of a parliamentary debate .
Most importantly , it acknowledges the limited window of opportunity for the EU and Iran . ""
In reaction to the resolution , a group of Iranian MPs who were planning to visit Strasbourg next week in order to reciprocate a recent EU parliamentary delegation 's visit to Tehran , had cancelled their trip .
Fars said MPs were also contemplating further retaliatory measures , including Tehran reconsidering its political and economic ties with the EU ."
2014-04-30,"The International Federation of Journalists ( IFJ ) has appealed to the president of Iran to allow the reopening of the headquarters of the Association of Iranian Journalists ( AoIJ ) and release imprisoned journalists .
In a letter to President Hassan Rouhani , the IFJ points out that the AoIJ 's Tehran offices have been closed since August 2009 , following an order from the general prosecutor .
It also calls for the president to take urgent action to secure the release of those journalists who are currently in Iranian prisons .
Signed by the IFJ 's president , Jim Boumelha , the letter welcomes statements by Rouhani about press freedom in Iran and the role and responsibility of journalists in upholding the right of Iranian citizens to receive reliable and trustworthy information .
But he adds : "" If these powerful statements are to have an enduring impact , it is crucial that your government now takes the positive and enduring action that will convey its commitment to freedom of speech and media freedom . ""

2014-05-04,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , is facing growing criticism from a broad array of political hardliners and rightwing opponents who say his government is being duped by the US in an over - hasty attempt to clinch a nuclear deal with the west and end economic sanctions .
At a meeting at the former American embassy building in central Tehran on Saturday , a newly formed group of MPs and rightwing activists calling itself "" We 're Worried "" claimed Iran 's negotiating team was ignoring national interests in the nuclear talks , which resume on 13 May in Vienna . ""
The whole nation believes the main intention of the United States is to fully halt the Iranian nuclear programme , "" said Fatemeh Alia , a central committee member of the hardline Islamic Revolution Resistance Front , previously allied to the former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
"" Since the beginning of the drafting of the final nuclear agreement with Iran is scheduled for 13 May this year , the analysts , the university students , the elites , and the university professors wish to express their worries to the [ Iranian ] nuclear negotiators hoping that they would heed such concerns , "" Alia told the official news agency Irna .
Despite an interim agreement in Geneva last November that granted Tehran limited sanctions relief in return for a slowing of its nuclear programme , no cracks had appeared in the international sanctions regime , Alia said .
Meanwhile the US had made additional demands concerning human rights and Iran 's missile stockpile .
Alia said the Rouhani government should stop treating its critics as "" illiterates "" .
EsmaËˆeil Kowsari , another MP , said the whole nation wanted an end to the nuclear standoff with the west , but the cost could be too high . ""
The main point in these negotiations is maintaining the balance in implementation of both sides ' commitments , which needs to be observed while preserving the interests and rights of the Iranian nation , "" Kowsari said .
The world powers had not shown the same "" honesty "" as Iran in abiding by their commitments , he said .
Pressure on Rouhani has been building in recent weeks as the likelihood of a deal has grown .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader and a staunch religious conservative , has backed the president 's negotiation policy but made clear that certain red lines can not be crossed .
To appease rightwingers , he has ordered a review of the negotiators ' performance .
"" I agreed to the government 's initiative to negotiate , just to break the hype , "" Khamenei said in a speech last month marking national nuclear technology day .
But Iran would continue to resist the designs of the "" Global Arrogance "" , he said , referring to the US . ""
The activities of the Islamic Republic in the area of nuclear research and development will not stop in any way .
None of the nuclear achievements of the country can be given up , "" , Khamenei said .
As a fallback , Khamenei continues to argue that sanctions can be rendered ineffective by increased economic self - sufficiency and by attracting investment from non - western partners such as China .
The US and Britain have expressed guarded confidence that a final nuclear deal with Iran can be reached by the deadline of 20 July , describing the talks as "" very substantive "" .
Rouhani and his chief negotiator , Mohammad Javad Zarif , have echoed those sentiments .
"" Iran is optimistic about the results of the talks and has taken great steps to reach a comprehensive deal and aims to achieve a win - win result , "" Rouhani told Iranian television last week .
Rouhani hit back angrily at his critics . ""
Through lies and hype some people are trying to derail the government from its path , and this is against national interests and the leader 's order â€ ¦
Iran does not compromise on the people 's interests , "" he said .
Part of the pressure on Rouhani stems not from public concern about the nitty - gritty of the nuclear deal but from entrenched partisan opposition to his new centrist government , which took office last year after defeating the conservative and rightwing principlist factions that dominated political life during the Ahmadinejad years .
Rouhani 's main electoral pledge was to improve the economy .
The lifting of sanctions is key to that objective , and has become more critical in the past nine months as economic conditions have deteriorated for most Iranians .
The rightwing opposition , which believes Rouhani is tainted by reformist ideas , claims his policy is failing , while popular support appears to be dropping .
Amir Mohebbian , an influential rightwing writer , government insider and founder of the traditionalist Modern Thinkers party , said the conservative opposition believed Rouhani had "" accepted the ideals and standards of the west before the negotiations even began "" .
While the battle played out between the two sides , Khamenei was straddling the fence and could yet jump either way , Mohebbian told the Guardian . ""
The supreme leader trusts Rouhani and Zarif in general but not in every case .
There are red lines .
We will not be bullied .
The leader has said Iran will be flexible .
But he is telling the radicals that the negotiators do not have a free hand , they do not have the final word .
This is also a message to the west not to push too hard . ""
The Obama administration is still increasing the pressure by raising human rights and missiles .
The US is looking for other problems .
If the west thinks by pressure and isolation they can force Iran to do what they want , it is making a very bad mistake , "" he said .
"" It would be better for the western countries to make a deal by the 20 July deadline , but it would not be a problem for Iran if the deadline was missed . """
2014-05-11,"The Ukraine crisis has strengthened Iran 's hand in its nuclear talks and other dealings with the west by reminding European countries and the Obama administration of its potential as a major alternative energy supplier if Russia can not be relied upon , officials and analysts in Tehran say .
But even as it attempts to play the Russia card , the government of President Hassan Rouhani is simultaneously stressing closer bilateral ties with Vladimir Putin 's Kremlin as a means of mitigating the impact of US , EU and UN economic sanctions , imposed in the still - unresolved row over Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" The western countries are imposing sanctions on Russia [ after its annexation of Crimea ] .
Now Russia is the bad guy , "" said Amir Mohebbian , a government adviser .
"" This has made the situation better for Iran 's nuclear negotiators .
Time is on our side .
If we sit here long enough , it will all come to Iran .
"" It was not for Iran to say who was right or wrong in Ukraine , said Mohammad Marandi , an international relations expert at Tehran University . ""
But of course if Iran is no longer under sanctions , the Europeans would have many more choices regarding energy .
At the same time , if the sanctions continue , Rouhani may move closer to Russia and China . ""
Majid Takht Ravanchi , deputy foreign minister and a member of Iran 's nuclear negotiating team , said Iran would focus solely on details of a deal to lift sanctions when nuclear talks resumed in Vienna this week .
But he did not deny Ukraine had placed matters in a new light . ""
Naturally Iran and Europe could have much better cooperation on the economy , trade , energy .
We believe there is much room for improvement , "" Ravanchi said .
The extent to which Iran could become Europe 's alternative energy supplier is borne out by statistics , and by growing western commercial interest in its energy sector .
Iran is the third largest Opec oil producer after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia .
It controls an estimated about 13 % of the world 's recoverable crude oil reserves and the world 's second largest natural gas reserves .
Despite sanctions that severely limit cash sales of Iranian energy , an international oil , gas , refining and petrochemicals exhibition in Tehran last week attracted 1,800 companies , among them 600 foreign companies from 32 countries including the US and Britain .
China is one of Iran 's biggest customers , owing an estimated $ 22bn ( £ 13bn ) for oil and gas supplies , which can not be paid due to banking sanctions .
Details emerged last week of plans for China to invest an equivalent sum in electricity and water projects as a way of circumventing the restrictions .
Similar barter deals are now in the pipeline with Russia .
Last month the Mehr news agency reported a planned $ 8bn-$10bn energy deal in which Russia would supply electricity , generating plants and a transmission network .
The US says an earlier proposal for Iran to supply 500,000 barrels of oil a day in return for Russian products would violate sanctions .
Speaking last month as the Ukraine crisis intensified , Rouhani went out of his way to praise Russia . ""
Strong political ties in bilateral , regional and international domains , along with vast economic relations between the two countries , set the stage for the promotion of peace and stability , "" he said .
Rouhani 's message to the west was plain : if there is no deal to end sanctions , Iran has strategic alternatives that the US , Britain and others may find unpalatable .
Western analysts worry the Iran - Russia relationship may expand into the security sphere .
Concern centres on the sale of Russian advanced S-300 advanced anti - missile defence systems , which would provide Iran with state - of - the - art protection in the event of a hypothetical Israeli or American attack .
The sale , agreed in 2007 , was blocked after Putin came under international pressure .
But if Moscow 's relations with the west deteriorate further , it is possible Russia 's president could give it the green light .
Iran insists , meanwhile , that its missile capabilities , both offensive and defensive , can not be part of talks with the west .
Despite the election victory of the more centrist Rouhani administration , Iran remains deeply at odds with the US on a range of other fronts extending beyond Russia and the nuclear talks .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and other hardline clerics persist in casting the US in the role of "" Great Satan "" or "" global arrogance "" .
They continue to castigate Israel at every opportunity , although former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's notorious threat to wipe it off the map is no longer repeated .
Iran is also embroiled in a regional power struggle with the key US ally , Saudi Arabia , and other Sunni Muslim Gulf states .
This so - called proxy war has found its sharpest expression in Syria , where the Sunni - Shia divide is most evident , but it also extends to Bahrain , Yemen and even Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iraq .
A Tehran official said Iran was intent on curtailing the spread of extremist Wahhabi ideology and jihadism that flowed from Saudi Arabia 's "" wealthy mosques , teachers and banks "" .
But there was also unanimous agreement on another , overriding objective : fulfilling Iran 's destiny as the leading power of the Middle East , the official said .
The US should not try to thwart this ambition , said Mohebbian .
"" We need a new dynamic .
The US and Iran should agree not to be friends and not to be enemies .
The US [ and Europe ] should accept Iran as it is .
It will be better for them not to have Iran as an enemy .
It would be expensive for them in the long run , more than they can imagine . """
2014-05-15,"Ever since Canada broke off diplomatic relations with Tehran , Ottawa has toughtened its stance on Iran , taking a similar approach to that of Israel .
As the west seizes upon the opportunity to engage with the moderate president , Hassan Rouhani , Canada just seems to be going in the opposite direction , ignoring not only calls for dialogue by the international community but also from the very Iranian dissident voices Ottawa claims to be defending .
Instead , Canada is siding with radicals – dodgy exiled groups and rightwing Israelis – and moving away from the realities on the ground .
In 2012 , Canada 's foreign affairs minister , John Baird , described Iran as "" the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today "" as it announced a unilateral decision to shut down his country 's embassy in Tehran and expel Iranian diplomats from the Canadian soil .
Within a year , as Rouhani travelled to New York to revamp Iran 's relations with the west backed by strong popular support at home , Baird warned "" kind words , a smile and a charm offensive are not a substitute for real action . ""
Later , as Iran and six world powers including Britain and the US , reached a historic nuclear agreement in Geneva , trying to defuse the threats of yet another war in the Middle East , Canada injected deep scepticism .
Canada 's big excuse is human rights .
Of course , Iran 's appalling human rights record , including the high rate of executions and arbitrary arrests of political activists , remains a big concern .
But Ottawa 's policy of isolating Tehran , at the time Rouhani is under pressure from internal hawks and fudamentalists , is doing a disservice both to the future of peace in the world and the wellbeing of Iranians themselves .
By rejecting engagement with Iran , Canada is also turning a blind eye to repeated calls by leading Iranian opposition figures , for the unique opportunity created because of Rouhani 's election .
This week 's Iran human rights event at Canada 's parliament embodied what is wrong with Ottawa 's approach .
A key speaker at a programme studying violations of human rights in Iran was Maryam Rajavi , the leader of the radical exiled group MEK , which was listed as terrorist organisation by the US and the UK until recently .
The MEK , charactrised by many observers as a cult - like group , has been repeatedly slammed by the United Nation because of mistreating its own members .
The MEK appearance at the programme reportedly made the UN special rapporteur for human rights in Iran , Ahmed Shaheed , to withdraw from the event , the Nation 's Ali Gharib reported on Wednesday .
To much criticism by the Iranian authorities , Shaheed has extensively reported on the violations of rights in Iran , including mistreatment of prisoners , some of whom are in fact in jail in Iran for having links to the MEK . ""
If you want to improve human rights in Iran , do n't invite MEK leader , a group accused of serious human rights violations , as a speaker , "" tweeted Golnaz Esfandiari , who blogs on Iran .
The MEK remains extremely unpopular in Iran because of its support for the former Iraqi leader , Saddam Hussein , during the eight - year war between Iran and Iraq .
MEK fought against their countrymen at the time .
Earlier this month , Lobelog 's Eldar Mamedov detailed how the MEK is using human rights as its casus belli to mix up the complexities of politics inside Iran for an outsider eye and derail the process of Iran - west rapproachment .
It looks as Canada is repeating a mistake the US and some European countries did decades ago by relying on radical groups such as MEK , or some Iranian monarchists , to keep itself updated about the complicated bigger picture of today 's Iran .
Moreover , Canada often berates Iran in the excuse of defending human rights activists and opposition figures who have been imprisoned in Iran .
But when the very same people , including 50 prominent political prisoners , reached to US president Barack Obama asking him to end "" crippling "" economic sanctions hurting ordinary people in Iran and seize "" the last chance "" for dialogue with Tehran under Rouhani , Canada seemed to have sealed its ears .
Instead , it should listen to more reasonable voices , such as it own former ambassador to Tehran , John Mundy , who has stated it was wrong for Ottawa to cut diplomatic ties .
Let 's be clear , no one is denying the gross abuses of human rights in Iran or the challenges ahead in finding a permanent nuclear settlement with the Islamic republic .
But human rights in Iran can only be improved by the ways of dialogue and engagement .
This is why the recent visit to Iran by the EU 's foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , who visited a number of leading women rights ' activists , was more effective than Canada 's many human rights statements .
Canada has had a very frosty relations with Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
It became more restrained in 2003 when an Iranian - Canadian photographer , Zahra Kazemi , died while in jail in Iran under torture because of a skull fracture .
But if Ottawa is genuine about the wellbeing of Iranian citizens , including those persecuted in the country , it should reconsider its Iran policy .
But for now , Canada is just getting it wrong on Iran .

2014-06-03,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , is in dispute with the countryâ€ ™ s hardliners over the path to paradise .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t take people to heaven by force and with a whip , â€ � he told participants at a healthcare conference in Tehran last month .
"" We should n't interfere in people 's lives to such an extent , even out of compassion .
Let them choose their own path to heaven . ""
For over three decades , the Islamic republic and its many affiliates have been committed to tell people right from wrong , even offering answers to the strangest sexual dilemmas that may come to one 's mind ; for instance , what to do with an unwanted child conceived in a bizarre way during an earthquake ?
Chess was banned for years , so was ( and in a way , it still is ) the female voice singing .
Videocassettes were exchanged in fear , men 's short - sleeved shirts were unwelcome , shorts are still banned in public for adults .
Unconventional hairstyles are deemed un - Islamic , water - pistol fights "" too intimate "" .
To date , needless to say , women have only one sartorial option : forced hijab .
In such an atmosphere , Rouhani 's words could be seen as quite blasphemous .
Last Friday , as prayer leaders in Tehran and Mashhad , a religious eastern city , took to their podiums to deliver their weekly sermons , they responded to the president 's utterances .
Both imams are directly appointed by the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Neither attacked Rouhani by name , but Ahmad Alamolhoda in Mashhad , known for his hawkish statements , declared : "" Forget the whip , we will stand with all our force in the way of those who prevent people from going to heaven . ""
In Tehran , Ahmad Khatami , echoed him : "" It 's a religious state 's responsibility to prepare the path to heaven . ""
Khatami also said : "" We should protect our religious state .
We do n't want to take people to heaven by force but neither should we pave the way to hell by making [ such ] statements . ""
Ayatollah Naser Makaren Shirazi , close to the conservatives , had this to say : "" We should n't open hell 's doors with our own hands . ""
Rouhani , who has tried to keep to the middle of the road , avoiding confrontation with his opponents in public , chose to speak out this time .
In a matter of days , he hit back by describing his opponents â€ “ without naming them â€ “ as disillusioned .
Some people , Rouhani said , spend time "" doing nothing except worrying for people 's beliefs and afterlife .
These people , they have no idea what is religion or what is afterlife . ""
Rouhani referred to examples within his lifetime of past resistance to modernisation in Iran .
When he was a young Talib ( student ) in the central city of Qom , he remembered , many clerics showed a great deal of opposition to two major events .
When the shower arrived in people 's houses , replacing old bathhouses , Rouhani said , many warned it was taking people 's religion away from them .
The other controversy was over time changes in the year .
Some complained it was jeapoardising prayer times .
Rouhani 's challenge today seems to be the internal battle over internet freedom , which his government favours .
Despite his attempts , the president has so far failed to deliver on his promises to lift the ban on Facebook and Twitter , which remain blocked in the country .
He has also repeatedly called on the authorities not to interfere in people 's private lives .
Last month , the arrests in Tehran of six young Iranians in connection with an Iranian version of Pharrell Williams ' hit song Happy brought huge embarrassment for the authorities .
The arrests were carried out by the police and not by his government .
Hardliners are also worried about a range of social and cultural related issues , including Iranians ' rising desire to access foreign - based satellite dishes .
The hijab is another issue , especially since a Facebook campaign highlighted the plight of a large number of Iranian women who want the freedom to not wear hijab .
This week , hardliners infuriated by the Facebook page created by journalist Masih Alinejad resorted to fabricating allegations against her in order to smear her in public .
Iran 's state TV ran a programme which falsely claimed she was raped in London , which Alinejad has flatly denied as a tactic to discredit her .
In the runup to his first anniversary as president , it appears that Rouhani 's battle with hardliners has just kicked off ."
2014-06-14,"Iran is seeking a deal with major world powers within weeks that would end years of dispute over the country 's nuclear programme and economic sanctions imposed on it by western powers , President Hassan Rouhani has said .
He said he wanted to reach an agreement by 20 July , adding that the the international sanctions regime had crumbled and would not be rebuilt â€ “ even if no final nuclear deal could be reached .
Rouhani also said he would be willing to work with the White House to meet the danger posed by Islamist extremists who have taken towns in northern Iraq , in a sign of shifting attitudes towards the US in Tehran . ""
The disputes can be resolved with goodwill and flexibility
â€
¦ I believe that the 20 July deadline can be met despite remaining disputes .
If not , we can continue the talks for a month or more , "" he said , addressing the nation in a live broadcast on state television . ""
During the nuclear negotiations we have displayed our strong commitment to diplomacy ( but even ) if a deal ca n't be reached by July 20 , conditions will never be like the past .
The sanctions regime has been broken .
"" We believe the issue can be settled by 20 July .
We are very serious at the talks .
"" Iran and the five permanent members of the UN security council â€ “ the US , Britain , France , Russia and China â€ “ and Germany will hold another four days of talks in mid - June in a bid to break a deadlock , which has raised the threat of the deadline pasisng without a deal .
An outright failure of the talks would strengthen the position of conservative hardliners in Iran 's clerical establishment against Rouhani , who has tried to improve relations with the country once termed the "" great Satan "" .
The countries severed ties during a hostage crisis after the 1979 Islamic Revolution . ""
The west should use this opportunity to reach a final deal in the remaining weeks .
American hawks and Israel will be blamed for ( any ) failure of the talks , "" Rouhani said , according to Reuters .
Iran insists it needs to maintain a domestic uranium enrichment capability to produce fuel for a planned network of nuclear power plants without having to rely on foreign suppliers .
But some western officials believe it will need many years to build any nuclear power station and that its underlying goal in enriching uranium is to be able to yield material for nuclear bombs at short notice , an allegation the Islamic state denies .
The latest round of negotiations in Vienna last month ran into difficulties when it became clear that the number of centrifuge enrichment machines that Iran wanted to maintain was well beyond what would be acceptable to the west ."
2014-06-14,"Iran has sent 2,000 advance troops to Iraq in the past 48 hours to help tackle a jihadist insurgency , a senior Iraqi official has told the Guardian .
The confirmation comes as the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , said Iran was ready to support Iraq from the mortal threat fast spreading through the country , while the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , called on citizens to take up arms in their country 's defence .
Addressing the country on Saturday , Maliki said rebels from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( Isis ) had given "" an incentive to the army and to Iraqis to act bravely "" .
His call to arms came after reports surfaced that hundreds of young men were flocking to volunteer centres across Baghdad to join the fight against Isis .
In Iran , Rouhani raised the prospect of Teheran cooperating with its old enemy Washington to defeat the Sunni insurgent group – which is attempting to ignite a sectarian war beyond Iraq 's borders .
The Iraqi official said 1,500 basiji forces had crossed the border into the town of Khanaqin , in Diyala province , in central Iraq on Friday , while another 500 had entered the Badra Jassan area in Wasat province overnight .
The Guardian confirmed on Friday that Major General Qassem Suleimani , the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards ' elite Quds Force , had arrived in Baghdad to oversee the defence of the capital .
There is growing evidence in Baghdad of Shia militias continuing to reorganise , with some heading to the central city of Samarra , 70 miles ( 110 km ) north of the capital , to defend two Shia shrines from Sunni jihadist groups surrounding them .
The volunteers signing up were responding to a call by Iraq 's most revered Shia cleric , the Iranian - born grand ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , to defend their country after Isis seized Mosul and Saddam Hussein 's hometown of Tikrit in a lightning advance this week .
Samarra is now the next town in the Islamists ' path to Baghdad . ""
Citizens who can carry weapons and fight the terrorists in defence of their country , its people and its holy sites should volunteer and join the security forces , "" Sheik Abdul - Mahdi al - Karbalaie , Sistani 's representative , said on Friday in a sermon at the holy Shia city of Kerbala .
He warned that Iraq faced great danger and that fighting the militants "" is everybody 's responsibility , and is not limited to one specific sect or group "" , Associated Press reported .
Karbalaie 's comments have consistently been thought to reflect Sistani 's views .
Meanwhile , Iraqi troops had been ordered out of the northern city of Kirkuk by Kurdish fighters who have taken full control of the regional oil hub and surrounding areas , according to a mid - ranking army officer .
His account was corroborated by an Arab tribal sheik and a photographer who witnessed the looting of army bases after troops left and who related similar accounts of the takeover from relatives in the army , the Associated Press reported .
"" They said they would defend Kirkuk from the Islamic State [ Isis ] , "" said the Arab officer , who oversaw a warehouse in the city 's central military base .
He insisted the Iraqi troops had not planned to retreat before the Islamic State .
"" We were ready to battle to death .
We were completely ready , "" he said at a roadside rest house just inside the semi - autonomous Kurdish region .
A spokesman for Kurdish forces , known as the peshmerga , said they had only moved in after Iraqi troops retreated , assuming control of the "" majority of the Kurdistan region "" outside the semi - autonomous Kurdish regional government . ""
Peshmerga forces have helped Iraqi soldiers and military leaders when they abandoned their positions , "" including by helping three generals to fly back to Baghdad from the Kurdish regional capital of Erbil , said Lieutenant General Jabbar Yawar in a statement on the regional government 's website .
A supporter of Maliki in the Iraqi parliament condemned the peshmerga 's move , calling it a plot carried out in co - ordination with the regional government that would lead to problems . ""
The Kurds have taken advantage of the current situation .
They seized Kirkuk and they have other plans to swallow other areas , "" Mohammed Sadoun said .
A colonel from the military command responsible for Samarra said Iraqi security forces were preparing a counter - offensive against Isis on Saturday .
The colonel , whom Maliki announced had been granted "" unlimited powers "" by the Iraqi cabinet , said reinforcements from the federal police and army arrived on Friday , according to Agence France - Presse .
The officer said the reinforcements were for a drive against areas north of the city , including Dur and Tikrit , and forces were awaiting orders to begin .
Sunni residents of west Baghdad said on Saturday Shia militias had taunted them with anti - Sunni chants .
Baghdad has remained in virtual lockdown for the past three days as Isis jihadists threatened to storm the capital .
However , Saturday morning saw relative normality return to deserted streets , with many residents returning to shops to stockpile supplies .
Residents offered little reaction to Barack Obama 's statement late on Friday in which he appeared to condition renewed US military support on Iraqi leaders first making efforts to pull the country back from the brink .
The US and Iran , foes throughout the US occupation of Iraq , share a common interest in defeating Isis , and Iran has so far expressed no opposition to US threats to send military support to Maliki .
Rouhani , asked at a televised press conference on Saturday whether Tehran could work with the US to tackle Isis , said : "" We can think about it if we see America starts confronting the terrorist groups in Iraq or elsewhere .
We all should practically and verbally confront terrorist groups .
"" Reuters reported US officials as saying there were no contacts taking place with Iran over the crisis in Iraq .
Meanwhile , the British foreign secretary , William Hague , had held talks with his Turkish counterpart , Ahmet Davutoglu , "" urgently to co - ordinate approaches to the instability in Iraq and links to Syria conflict "" , he said on Twitter .
Britain is to give £ 3 m ( $ 5.1 m ) of aid to Iraq as the first step in dealing with the humanitarian consequences of the insurgency .
The international development secretary , Justine Greening , said the initial tranche of emergency funding would allow agencies to supply water , sanitation , medicine , hygiene kits and basic household items ."
2014-06-15,"It is one of the more intriguing twists of the Iraq crisis : the prospect of cooperation between the US and Iran in the scramble to bolster Nouri al - Maliki 's beleaguered government against Sunni extremists seeking to set up an Islamic emirate .
Hassan Rouhani , the Iranian president , has made clear how concerned Tehran is about the success of Isis fighters who have captured swaths of territory – even suggesting on Saturday that Iran might work with the US to halt their advance .
On Sunday , however , the tone was markedly more cautious , with an Iranian official warning that "" any foreign military intervention in Iraq "" would only complicate the crisis .
"" Iraq has the capacity and necessary preparations for the fight against terrorism and extremism , "" the foreign ministry insisted .
It does look , though , as if Maliki can count on some discreet help .
Qasim Suleimani , commander of the Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards , has been visiting Baghdad – though Tehran quickly denied this .
Suleimani has been a key , if shadowy , figure for the last decade , pulling strings and lubricating links with Iraqi politicians and militias , some with long experience in fighting US forces after the 2003 invasion .
The Brookings Institution , a respected US thinktank , reported over the weekend that Iran appears to have committed three battalion - sized groups of Quds force personnel – likely to be trainers and advisers tasked to improve the performance of indigenous Iraqi units , rather than to fight themselves .
Suleimani also manages Iranian ties with the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah , vital in giving Bashar al - Assad the edge over the Syrian rebels fighting to overthrow him .
Now another important client , Maliki , is in serious trouble and Tehran is being forced to defend him and century - old national borders that are being eroded by violent jihadis with potentially disastrous consequences for the balance of power across the region .
Iran wields considerable influence in Iraq , though Iraq 's Shia majority have good national and religious reasons of their own for fighting Sunni extremism : Ayatollah Ali Sistani , the community 's spiritual authority , who is often described as a "" quietist , "" called for Iraqis to defend themselves against Isis .
Tehran is sending out the same message : the Iraqi - born Iranian Ayatollah Mohammad Hashemi Shahroudi , who is close to Ayatollah Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , urged Iraqis to unite against terrorism .
Ayatollah Mohammad Emami - Kashani , another senior Iranian cleric , gave part of his Friday prayer address in Arabic rather than Persian to express support for "" the great and brave people of Iraq "" .
US responses to the crisis have been more transparent but are hard to predict .
Barack Obama 's decision to deploy an aircraft carrier to the Gulf does not mean combat missions will automatically follow .
Putting American boots back on the ground in Iraq seems unthinkable in the light of the president 's instinctive wish to avoid new Middle Eastern entanglements – even when , as in the case of last summer 's Syrian chemical weapons attacks , his own "" red lines "" and wider US credibility are at stake .
Commentators in Tehran and Washington have argued that these old enemies share significant interests in defending the status quo in Baghdad : for example , both had urged Maliki to act more inclusively to stop alienating Sunnis for fear of empowering Isis . ""
Iraq is one of those places that contradicts the popular notion that Iranian and American interests constitute a zero - sum game , "" the analyst Kenneth Pollack , a CIA veteran , commented on the eve of the April elections .
"" There , what is bad for Iran is often just as bad for the United States and what they want to see is often what we want to see as well . ""
Whether those common interests will extend to actual , as opposed to de facto , military coordination – US air strikes or drone intelligence in support of Iranian revolutionary guards , or Iranian - advised Iraqi units – remains to be seen .
It is fascinating too to speculate whether any cooperation could impact on the ongoing talks on Iran 's nuclear programme , a month before the deadline for a deal .
Iraq 's Kurds have been clearer in their approach to the crisis .
The humiliating flight of the Iraqi army in the face of the Isis takeover of Mosul created a golden opportunity for peshmerga forces – the best - trained and equipped military units in the country – to occupy territory outside the provinces controlled by the Kurdish regional government ( KRG ) , especially in the Kirkuk area .
Erbil – in conflict with Baghdad over oil resources , revenues and territory – has certainly gained some handy leverage over Maliki .
But the changes may be a mixed blessing .
Aside from having to absorb huge numbers of refugees , the Kurds could face difficulties with their new neighbours .
"" The KRG will not only have to secure greater territories and populations from extremist groups on its borders , "" the analyst Denise Natali warned in Al - Monitor , "" but also manoeuvre its nationalist agenda through radicalised Sunni Arab populations that may be even more resistant than Maliki and Shia groups . """
2014-06-17,"It 's 11.30pm Tehran time and Hassan Rouhani is relaxing at home , watching the World Cup match between Iran and Nigeria .
His usual dark clerical robe ( aba ) is discarded , his white turban ( ammameh ) put aside , he sits in a tight - fitting Iranian team shirt ( unbuttoned ) , bare arms on show , and tracksuit pants on his sofa watching a widescreen TV .
There 's no bottle of beer , but a cup of Persian tea and a plate of fruit in front of him .
It 's clearly carefully posed â€ “ too good to be an spontaneous picture â€ “ but still , quite remarkable for a 65-year - old Iranian cleric . ""
Proud of our boys who secured our first point
â€ “ hopefully the first of many more to come , "" the president tweeted , referring to the goalless draw in Curitiba , along with the photo â€ “ retweeted at least 3,000 times .
Rouhani has 213,000 Twitter followers .
The ' average Joe ' pictures are all part of Iran 's soccer diplomacy .
In Vienna , where senior Iranian and western diplomats were engaged in intense nuclear negotiations , talks were put on hold on Monday night too allow Iran 's foreign minister to watch the match .
A picture posted on Twitter by Iranian journalist Akram Sharifi , showed Mohammad Javad Zarif sat next to senior Iranian nuclear negotiators glued to a big screen showing the match , joined by a pool of Iranian journalists .
Rouhani 's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was an avid football fan
but Rouhani 's picture is probably the first of its kind showing a president , who is also a cleric , off - duty at home .
It is also remarkable because clerics in Iran have in the past criticised football as a western sport and are generally critical of men wearing short - sleeve clothing .
Very few photographs of the Iranian supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , have been published without a clerical robe .
There is almost no picture of his wife available online .
There is an unwritten law prohibiting Iranian cartoonists from depicting clerics .
Reza Haghighatnejad , an Iranian analyst with the website Iranwire , said Rouhani 's photo was "" one of the few successful credits in the one - year balance sheet "" of Rouhani 's media team .
Some have criticised Rouhani for not having his wife by his side as he watched the World Cup match Despite this , Rouhani 's wife , Sahebe Arabi , has engaged in a number of public appearances since her husband assumed power .
In his first year as president , Rouhani , has become an outspoken critic of dogmatism among his fellow clerics .
"" Some people still live in the stone age , "" Rouhani complained last week .
Rouhani has locked horns with the Iran 's hardliners after saying "" we ca n't take people to heaven by force and with a whip . ""
Female football fans can not attend football matches at Iranian stadiums .
In their first match in Brazil , Iranian players wore kits highlighting the cause to preserve Iranian cheetahs ."
2014-06-19,"As the school year comes to a close and Tehran ’s scorching heat becomes a daily affair , Iran ’s morality police have snuggled back into their favorite parking spots on the western edge of Vanak Square .
From aboard a public bus , I spot five morality police vans patrolling the streets between this square and the capital ’s busiest intersection downtown .
On Sunday , 195 members of the Iranian parliament signed a letter warning moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to get serious about confronting women failing to properly observe modest Islamic covering - or hijab - or else , the letter reads , Iranian society will face “ irreversible consequences ” from a western cultural onslaught seeking to “ change
the Iranian people ’s way of life vis - à - vis hijab and chastity .
”
For weeks state TV has drawn attention to the hijab in televised debates , and pro - hijab posters likening badly veiled women to unwrapped candy bars preyed on by flies made the rounds on social networks .
A popular Facebook page run by an Iranian expat journalist hosting photos Iranian women have furtively snapped of themselves sans - headscarf has caused a conservative uproar .
It intensified when in a provocative speech , Rouhani asked hardliners to stop “ interfering in people ’s lives .
”
On the anniversary of his election , he slammed opponents who still “ think we ’re living in the Stone Age .
”
This is not new .
Even before his election in a largely forgotten interview with the youth magazine Chelcheragh , then presidential hopeful Rouhani hinted that even those who do n’t observe the Islamic veil in the “ desired way ” can be good people .
“
Before the revolution , many women in our society did not wear the hijab - but were they not virtuous humans ?
”
On the campaign trail , Rouhani vowed to rein in the morality police , an organ the president does not directly control .
But attempts to shuffle police commanders and move morality police under the jurisdiction of his own interior ministry have been defeated by more powerful conservative forces in the establishment .
What ’s painfully apparent from all this is that it ’s summer in Tehran , which in recent memory has meant a renewed push by hardliners who control the disciplinary forces to redeploy the morality police in larger numbers to keep tabs on those who stray from the ambiguously defined public dress code .
But as we enter Rouhani ’s first full summer as president , it ’s clear the presence of the morality police does not approach levels under Ahmadinejad .
I decide to join friends - of - friends for lunch in south Tehran , later retreating to one of their homes for some refreshing virgin mojitos - from - concentrate .
It turns out they work for the arts section of an Iranian cultural digest and passing mention of the morality police this summer inspires lively debate .
“
They ’re not as noticeable as they used to be , ” notes writer Banafsheh , speaking of of the morality police .
Her friend Sepideh cuts in from across the room , disagreeing - “
No way , I still see them at Haft - e Tir Square - they ’re still there .
”
Banafsheh ’s husband Hadi puts the debate to rest .
“
There are far fewer morality police
, it ’s obvious ” he says , adding that their latest tactic is to stealthily patrol the streets rather than planting themselves in a crowded public area .
Hadi owns a women ’s clothing store downtown and works in manteau production as well .
He ’s watched the seasonal process unfold every year : the ramp - up in promotional hijab campaigns and pointed televised debates as the weather starts to warm and wardrobe begins to malfunction .
“
When do they start these debates ?
When they want to increase their morality police deployments , ” he says .
Hadi recently received a warning from his guild to stop producing the latest garment used to skirt what are often ambiguous restrictions : the “ open ” ( i.e. unrobed ) , buttonless manteau .
But such regulations for storeowners like Hadi have proven fruitless .
He remembers when he was instructed not to sell short manteaus years ago , “
but then [ storeowners ] started selling them behind the counter ” for exorbitant prices , Hadi says .
The DIY solution at the time , he says , was for women to “ snip their manteaus short .
”
Orders from above ca n’t institute change : “ if it ’s not demanded , then it wo n’t be produced , ” he says .
Despite eight years of conservative domination when the morality police were a staple of Tehran ’s busiest junctions and metro stops , Tehran ’s wardrobe deviations have historically failed to be “ corrected .
”
Bracelets , necklaces , extraordinary haircuts , western graphic tees , and long hair that once landed men in the pound have largely been thrown out the window because today , the morality police has evolved to almost exclusively target women .
For them , pushing boundaries once meant donning colorful outfits and light makeup in the early years after the 1979 revolution .
Then came boots - some recall former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ’s chador - clad daughter making headlines with her high - tops in the mid-90s .
During the Khatami era in the late 90s and early 2000s , Iranian women speak of Capri pants , shorter manteaus , and more exposed hair .
But hardliners tried to roll back as much of that as possible when conservative Ahmadinejad took office , or a period Hadi describes as “ the Taliban all over again ” when for a time , women were fined for each individual painted fingernail .
But still , even as the morality police units grew in number , manteaus continued to grow progressively shorter and tighter , sleeves shrank , and a new technique emerged to hang the headscarf on a small , pointy bun on the back of women ’s heads .
These days , hardliners are riled by exposed ears , “ leggings , ” and robe - like “ open ” manteaus .
Since Rouhani , headscarves remain off inside cars for some ; others simply neglect to put their scarves back on when they fall off in public spaces .
All of this has produced outrageous styles “ you might not even see in Europe , ” Hadi says , his conservative Mashhadi roots making a brief cameo .
“
Our society is n’t that open , ” he says .
“ We have to accept that we live in an Islamic society .
”
He expects his wife Banafsheh to dress accordingly in the pious , working class south Tehran neighborhood where we ate .
When you ’re at a friend ’s house , you have to abide by their house rules , he says—“wherever
you are , wear clothes that are suitable for the location .
” I meet up with Maryam , a graduate student , and her dorm - mates at a cavernous café downtown .
From the mood - lit plumes of cigarette smoke emerges our server - a woman - wearing one of those “ open , ” untied , unbuttoned robes Hadi was talking about , hair flowing out from underneath a rag that looks like it could slide off her head at any moment .
The café is a kind sanctuary for women , with an abundance of exposed ears , forearms , and hair .
Maryam senses a tangibly diminished morality police “ presence .
”
“
During the Ahmadinejad era , ” she says , “ there were always two to three vans in Vanak [ Square ] every day , but now , they ’re there one day , but not the next .
”
Internally , I ca n’t help but agree .
I think back to just two years ago - a chador - clad officer stationed inside a hamburger joint near Parkway with a walkie - talkie in hand to call in for back up , the unit that practically guarded the Mellat Park entrance every waking moment of the day , the van loading up unsuspecting denizens outside an ice cream shop in Gisha , the officers perched just outside the Haft - e Tir metro exit .
The morality police is still here in a big way , getting ready for another season of public harassment , but it ’s nothing like it used to be .
“
We ’ve learned where they are ” and how to avoid them , Maryam says - her getup today seems a bit risky , but she assures me
she ’s only dressed this way because they do n’t patrol this area
“ unless they ’re driving back to the station ” with their daily catch .
Still , she frequently looks over her shoulder when roaming the streets .
For her younger dorm - mate Zahra , who ’s taken up work at a bank , it ’s no big deal .
“
Before we used to get scared , but now it ’s a routine affair for us , ” she says of being arrested .
It ’s nothing like the early days of the revolution when neighborhood vigilantes would torment those they deemed immodest under a selective interpretation of the Islamic principle of “ commanding the good and forbidding the evil .
”
Today , Zahra says , “ they just snap a few pictures [ of the arrestees ] and let them go ” after calling in a relative to bring a change of [ more “ modest ” ] clothes .
But what the government ca n’t control is effortlessly kept in check by social forces , as has always been the case in Iran .
In other words , Maryam wo n’t dare wear the outfit she ’s wearing in front of me - nor would Zahra - in Rah - Ahan Square in south Tehran , which is almost entirely devoid of morality police unlike the affluent north .
“
We could never go walking looking like this in Rah - Ahan , ” Zahra says .
“
Sure , there ’s no morality police
—
but it ’s the people .
”
The quieter Saeedeh , a college student , speaks up .
Even if the mandatory hijab is removed one day she says , “ you still wo n’t be able to wear shorts near Rah - Ahan Square ” in south Tehran .
I find myself seated on a bench on the outer rim of Vanak Square , swarming with morality police , when another man takes a seat beside me .
We ’re both enraptured by the unfolding squabble between a woman in a conservative getup , excepting the red - streaked hair just peaking out from underneath her black headscarf , and the chador - cloaked morality police officer accosting her .
Several stop dead in their tracks to watch ; others look over their shoulder mid - stride .
It ’s a public spectacle .
The male officer orders spectators to move along .
“
Do n’t worry , ” the man tells me , ” they wo n’t ask us to move along because we ’re sitting on this bench here .
”
We continue to watch .
The woman is resisting arrest .
After failed attempts by the chador - clad woman to reel her in with her scowling face , the male officer intervenes to give it a shot , gesturing with a typical “ come on now , let ’s go , ” but the red - streaked lady jolts back in a don’t - touch - me kind of way .
As she continues to resist , a rather flamboyantly dressed , hair - flaunting woman — her scarf tucked behind her ears - carouses past them unscathed .
I turn away for an instant and when my attention returns to the scene , I notice the red - streaked woman has disappeared into what I presume is the van .
Another group of schoolgirls walks past us
- “ which one do you think they ’re going to arrest ?
” the man seated next to me asks .
He ’s hedged his bets on the one in the center , in blue .
I tell him I really ca n’t say .
As the past few minutes of people - watching on this bench have revealed , a few of them tidy up their headscarves as they approach the morality police unit , only to have them almost immediately slide back again .

2014-06-20,"Several employees of an Iranian technology news website , including bloggers , have been given long jail terms for alleged links to the BBC .
In an apparent blow to the administration of President Hassan Rouhani , which is trying to improve ties with the west , including Britain , Iran 's judiciary handed down various sentences of up to 11 years to staff at Narenji .
Iranian authorities said this year that some of the employees had participated in projects run by the BBC and in its training courses , and received funds deriving from London .
The Guardian understands at least one of the detainees was among the trainees of an award - winning journalism development programme run by the BBC World Service Trust from 2006 to 2010 , called ZigZag .
In December , at least 16 Iranian nationals were picked up by members of the elite forces of the Revolutionary Guards from the southern province of Kerman for working or having links to Narenji and its associate company , Govashir .
Narenji 's founder , Aliasghar Honarmand , was jailed for 11 years , the Guardian has learned .
Of those arrested last year , at least 11 have been found guilty â€ “ three remain in prison , including Honarmand , Hossein Nozari , who was sentenced to seven years and Ehsan Paknejad , who was sentenced to five years .
Others are believed to have been released on bail with suspended prison sentences of between three months and two and half years . ""
The group consisted of 11 people who were designing websites and providing contents to anti - state and anti - Iranian media , "" Yadollah Movahed of Kerman 's local judiciary told reporters , according to the Fars news agency . ""
The group had a direct contact with satellite channels such as BBC Persian . ""
Narenji 's staff can appeal the sentences .
Movahed also said two people , in separate cases to that of Narenji , were convicted of collaborating with Britain 's secret intelligence service , MI6 , and the Zionist regime ( a reference to Israel ) .
One was sentenced to 10 years , and the other five , but he did not identify them .
Iranian authorities have deep suspicion of the BBC , suspecting it of being a British espionage tool , and have accused dozens in recent years of collaborating with the corporation , especially its Persian service .
Earlier this month , a prominent documentary film - maker , Mahnaz Mohammadi , was jailed for five years for alleged links to the BBC , which she has vehemently denied .
BBC Persian has repeatedly said it has no employees inside Iran .
There is also an internal fight between Rouhani 's government and hardliners over internet freedom .
The Iranian president has advocated greater access to the web but has been prevented by the judiciary and the Revolutionary Guards .
The recent sentencing because of links with the BBC have also coincided with the British foreign secretary William Hague 's announcement earlier this week that London was opening its embassy in Tehran , a few years after angry mobs stormed it .
In May , it emerged that eight people , including an Iranian - born British woman , had been jailed for their activities on Facebook .
Roya Saberinejad , a 47-year - old from Stockport , was sentenced to 20 years ."
2014-07-10,"Iran and the UK are in the process of pouring balm on old wounds .
But as they upgrade diplomatic ties after many frosty years , hardliners in Tehran are determined to send a signal to moderates in their own country as well as reminding Britain they still considered it "" the old fox "" .
President Hassan Rouhani , educated in Glasgow , may be willing to restore relations with London .
But Iran 's judiciary , which is independent of his government , together with the country 's elite revolutionary guards , are intent on making their views clear .
In recent months , the Iranian authorities have been stepping up pressure on people for alleged links to the BBC , which Iranian fundamentalists believe to be a tool for British espionage .
Last month , Aliasghar Honarmand , a former trainee on the World Service Trust 's award - winning journalism development programme , ZigZag , was sentenced to 11 years in jail in Iran .
Honarmand – founder of the gadget news website Narenji – was arrested in December along with more than a dozen of his colleagues , at least a 10 of whom have been found guilty .
One , Hossein Nozari , was sentenced to seven years in jail , Ehsan Paknejad to five years and Abbas Vahedi to two and a half years .
Alleged links to the BBC appear to be a motivating factor in their prosecution .
Speaking to the press , the head of Kerman province 's justice department , Ali Tavakoli , said that those arrested had participated in projects run by the BBC and received funds from London . ""
This gang was running a number of projects and plans for anti - revolutionary Iranians based abroad , especially for the BBC Persian , under the guise of legitimate activities , "" he said .
"" Financial aid for this group was usually provided from London under the pretext of charitable donations .
The director of the team was an individual who has served the BBC as a mentor and teacher in a number of countries such as Malaysia , India and Afghanistan and his travels to these countries were paid for by British intelligence services .
"" Iran has a notorious track record of harassing people for alleged links to the BBC .
The Islamic republic has an ongoing campaign aimed at intimidating BBC Persian 's staff working in exile , with families back in Iran routinely summoned and interrogated .
In some cases , they have been barred from leaving their country .
Despite Rouhani 's mandate , the intimidatory tactics are ongoing .
But what is striking to me is how the BBC has handled Iran 's actions .
I could not find coverage of the Narenji sentences on the BBC 's English website or TV news network , although the BBC 's Persian service covered the arrests .
People I have been speaking to , including current employees , say that the BBC is being too conservative .
A former member of staff said : "" Iran knows about Honarmand 's past BBC association and the BBC also knows about his ... links , but they do n't want to speak out . ""
The BBC said in a statement that it condemned the imprisonment of journalists in Iran and had raised the harassment of its Persian service staff with the UN – but despite being pressed by the Guardian , it did not comment on Honarmand 's case .
"" We are concerned about the safety of journalists wherever they are .
When we have discussed the plight of journalists in Egypt – which is the most high - profile case at the moment – we have been consistent in relating their story to the plight of journalists who are arrested and attacked across the world , "" said a BBC spokesperson .
"" We take the harassment of BBC Persian staff and their families very seriously and we have publicly condemned this unacceptable behaviour on many occasions . ""
Given Honarmand 's harsh jail sentence , it is hard to imagine how BBC coverage of his plight could make the situation worse .
Honarmand 's collaboration with the organisation continued until 2009 .
He became a media trainer , and was also involved in designing websites run by the BBC in Afghanistan .
He may never have been an employee , but he was nevertheless associated with the BBC and appears to have suffered great harm as a result of those links .
The BBC has campaigned admirably on behalf of al - Jazeera journalists jailed in Egypt .
It has also protested loudly , and devoted significant coverage , to the harassment of BBC Persian employees by the Iranian regime .
It can only be right , then , for the organisation to make a full - throated protest against the unjustifiable jail sentence meted out to Aliasghar Honarmand and his colleagues , apparently for being journalists with links , however slight , to the BBC .
They should not be ignored ."
2014-07-12,"The US philosopher Noam Chomsky has called on Iran to release the female journalist Marzieh Rasouli who was jailed last week to endure a sentence of 50 lashes and two years in prison .
Chomsky told the Guardian that the detention of Rasouli and at least three other female journalists in the past two months was "" entirely unacceptable "" , urging Hassan Rouhani 's administration to swiftly act for their release .
Saba Azarpeik and Reyhaneh Tabatabaei are among other journalists arrested recently .
"" I was surprised and distressed to learn of the detention and harsh treatment of Marzieh Rasouli and other women journalists in Iran , "" Chomsky told the Guardian . ""
Surely such actions are entirely unacceptable , and I hope and trust that they will quickly be released and compensated for their unjust punishment . ""
At the time Rouhani is improving relations with the west , Iran 's judiciary , which is independent of his government , together with the country 's intelligence and security apparatus have launched a new wave of arrests of journalists .
Activists said another female reporter , Sajedeh Arabsorkhi , was also summoned to serve her one - year jail term .
On the case of Reyhaneh Tabatabaei , the international campaign for human rights in Iran ( ICHRI ) , said she was summoned to Tehran 's notorious Evin prison in June to serve her six - month sentence .
Rasouli , who has written for a number of reformist publications including Shargh and Etemaad newspapers , was jailed after a supreme court upheld her conviction on the charges of "" spreading propaganda "" against the ruling system and "" disturbing the public order "" , vague charges used by the Iranian authorities in recent years against activists and journalists .
Reporters Without Borders also condemned Rasouli 's jailing in Iran and reported that , with a total of 64 journalists and bloggers in prison , Iran has become one of the world 's worst enemies of the media .
This is not the first time Rasouli has been locked up behind bars . ""
Originally detained on 18 January 2012 and placed in solitary confinement in section 2A of Evin prison , a wing managed by the Revolutionary Guards , she had been freed on bail of 300 million toman ( 350,000 euros ) , "" said RWB .
Before being summoned to prison , Rasouli 's friends and colleagues took her out for dinner to wish her well , according to messages posted on Twitter ."
2014-07-13,"Next month , Hassan Rouhani will mark his first anniversary in Tehran 's Pasteur Street , where the offices of the Iranian president are based .
But his celebration will be incomplete if there is no agreement in Vienna by the end of this week .
Rouhani needs a deal to keep his moderate mandate safe , as hardliners circle like vultures , waiting for him to fail .
That pressure to produce results will sound familiar to John Kerry and the US diplomats who arrived on Sunday in the Austrian capital to galvanise talks for a comprehensive nuclear deal before the 20 July deadline .
But for Rouhani and his team , the task is perhaps even more urgent than for Barack Obama , who is desperate for a single foreign policy achievement to leave as his legacy .
In Tehran , the ultimate decision - maker is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the supreme leader , who despite being unelected and a top religious authority , can change the fate of the ongoing talks overnight against Rouhani 's wishes .
For now , the cleric appears to be backing Rouhani 's negotiating team , which is led by the country 's foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif .
The US - educated veteran diplomat has described himself as a follower of Khamenei , but is also a confident of Rouhani and remains popular with the general public .
In the light of Khamenei 's support , opponents of the deal have kept quiet .
Among them is Saeed Jalili , Iran 's former leading nuclear negotiator , who failed to bring a solution even an inch closer .
Jalili and his allies can barely conceal their resentment at Rouhani 's "" constructive engagement "" with the west .
A year after assuming power , Rouhani has had some remarkable achievements , not least putting an end to eight years of political infighting under his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He also became the first Iranian leader to hold direct talks with a US leader , in a historic telephone call with Obama last year .
But international sanctions against Iran are still in place , almost intact in spite of an interim deal , and although Rouhani has curbed inflation , reduced the mismanagement of the Ahmadinejad era and inspired some hope among the public , he has plenty to do .
Rouhani 's big challenge , besides securing a nuclear deal and ending sanctions , is an Iranian version of glasnost : increasing social freedoms and releasing imprisoned dissidents , activists and journalists .
Failure to reach a nuclear deal would make reform at home difficult , if not impossible .
Meanwhile , the hardliners have not stood idly by .
The judiciary and the elite revolutionary guards have tightened their grip on social and cultural norms , arresting more journalists and handing down heavy sentences to activists and dissidents .
Religious and ethnic minorities still face discrimination and Rouhani 's promise to overturn the ban on Facebook and Twitter is yet to materialise .
Moreover , opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi remain under house arrest .
Khamenei , in office for 25 years , holds the key â€ “ on the Iranian side â€ “ to a way out of the decades - long impasse over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
He declared last week that he had complete faith in Rouhani 's negotiation team , but in the same speech tied their hands by laying out Iran 's maximalist position : a tenfold boost to its uranium enrichment programme , so it can produce all its own nuclear reactor fuel .
The declaration made it harder for Iranian negotiators to make compromises and for Rouhani to claim victory in Vienna .
It was unclear whether the supreme leader was attempting to torpedo the negotiations , or merely distancing himself from them ."
2014-07-30,"The arrest of the Washington Postâ€ ™ s Tehran correspondent Jason Rezaian and his journalist wife , Yeganeh Salehi , as well as a photographer and her partner , is a brutal reminder of the distance between President Hassan Rouhaniâ€ ™ s reforming promises and his willingness to act .
His silence on this arrest , which took place over a week ago on 22 July , is turning the affair into a public test of the presidentâ€ ™ s ambition to usher in the more liberal era he promised barely a year ago , and his readiness to resist the determination of the conservative judiciary and ultimately Ayatollah Khamenei to block him .
If he does not speak out in defence of Mr Rezaian , his wife and colleagues , it will be a damaging blow to confidence in his capacity to deliver â€ “ particularly in the US .
Tehranâ€ ™ s shameful approach to independent journalism goes back a long way .
The shah ran a notoriously repressive regime for years before he was overthrown in 1979 .
The revolution promised a golden dawn , a time when the notorious Evin prison would be redundant and become a museum .
But although under the ayatollahs there have been fleeting moments of optimism , there have also been long periods of repression .
President Rouhani , anxious to engage with the west , seemed to hold out a real promise of change and in particular an end to the clampdown on journalists which had been precipitated by the violent protests that followed 2009â€ ™ s stolen election .
The release , a month after he took office in August last year , of several activists and the human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh raised hopes the promise might be fulfilled .
But within six months , reports were emerging that journalists and other prisoners were being beaten up , as Evin once again became the scene of violence and degradation .
There are now more than 30 journalists in jail , and another 30 bloggers .
Journalistsâ€ ™ defence organisations have Iran high on their lists of offenders .
The Iranian journalistsâ€ ™ association has been banned since 2009 .
Journalists are still routinely imprisoned without trial on charges so vague they are almost impossible to refute .
Several women journalists have just been imprisoned .
One , Marzieh Rasouli , has been sentenced to 50 lashes for disturbing the public order .
Another , Saba Azarpeik , has been held incommunicado for two months .
As President Rouhani well knows , this is no way to govern a major regional power concerned to build a new relationship with the west .
Mr Rezaian , who has joint US - Iranian citizenship , went to Iran in 2012 , one of the few western journalists given permission to work there , to send home a more nuanced account of life in the country .
His detention , and that of his wife and colleagues , is a breach of the journalistic freedom President Rouhaniâ€ ™ s new Iran should be upholding ."
2014-08-15,"In what may prove to be an important moment , the Iranian president has tweeted a photo of the first woman to win the Fields medal â€ “ a woman of Iranian descent â€ “ with her head uncovered .
Hassan Rouhani tweeted the photo of Maryam Mirzakhani on Thursday with the caption â€œCongrats to # MaryamMirzakhani on becoming the first ever woman to win the # FieldsMedal , making us Iranians very proudâ€ � .
The black and white photo shows two pictures side by side of Mirzakhani , who is Iranian but now lives in America .
In one she is not wearing a head scarf and in the next she is veiled .
In Iran it is compulsory for women to wear headscarves with fines and even jail for women who disobey .
The dress code has been implemented strictly since the 1979 revolution .
Rouhani , a known moderate , became president in August and has reportedly ordered the dedicated morality police to exercise more discretion in issuing fines , verbal notices and arrests of women considered to be breaking this code .
Mirzakhani is the first woman to win the Fields medal , also described as the Nobel prize for mathematics .
She is a maths professor based at Stanford University in California .
Rouhani has faced fierce opposition from hard right political opponents , particularly for his efforts to engage with the west .
He addressed them in a speech which was broadcast live this week in which he pulled no punches .
â€œSome of them chant slogans but they are political cowards .
As soon as we negotiate they start shaking .
Go to hell and find somewhere to stay warm , â€ � he said .
The Guardian published an interview with Mirzakhani on Wednesday ."
2014-08-30,"US sanctions against Iran will hinder talks over the country 's nuclear programme , the Iranian foreign ministry has warned .
The comments came as Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , said the country should "" resist "" the measures .
On Friday , the US imposed sanctions on more than 25 businesses , banks and individuals it suspected of working to expand Iran 's nuclear programme , support terrorism and help Iran evade existing sanctions .
The measures bar Americans from engaging in transactions with any of the designated parties , freeze their assets and block their property under US jurisdiction .
Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman Marzieh Afkham said the new sanctions would jeopardise a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers , the official IRNA news agency reported on Saturday .
"" These actions have a negative and non - constructive impact on the trend of the talks .
The Islamic Republic of Iran rejects any unilateral and self - serving interpretation of last year 's Geneva deal , "" she said .
"" Iran strongly believes that the sanctions are against commitments made by the United States under the Geneva deal . ""
Rouhani also attacked the sanctions , saying they were an "" invasion of the Iranian nation "" .
He said : "" We should resist the invasion and put the invaders in their place .
We should not allow the continuation and repetition of the invasion .
"" Iran 's state television also said the move violated an interim agreement reached with world powers under which western nations agreed to ease sanctions in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear activities .
However , Friday 's action did not constitute an expansion of the sanctions regime , but rather the enforcement of existing sanctions .
Western nations have long suspected Iran of covertly seeking a nuclear weapons capability alongside its civilian programme , a charge denied by Tehran , which insists its programme is for entirely peaceful purposes , like power generation and the production of medical isotopes .
Iran and the P5 + 1 group of world powers â€ “ the US , Britain , France , China and Russia , plus Germany â€ “ hope to reach a comprehensive nuclear agreement by November that would address western concerns about the nuclear programme and lift crippling international sanctions on Tehran .
Rouhani , a reputed moderate , was elected last year after promising to engage the west diplomatically in order to get the sanctions lifted .
But he has faced criticism from hardliners who say he has conceded too much in the nuclear talks ."
2014-09-16,"Earlier this summer , Ghoncheh Ghavami stood outside Tehran 's majestic Azadi ( freedom ) stadium , wearing a white scarf and holding up a placard .
With Hassan Rouhani promising a more moderate stance in Iran , she wanted to enter the stadium alongside male fans , hoping that the Islamic republic 's ban on women attending big sporting events would finally be over .
As Iran 's volleyball team hosted Italy later that Friday , Ghavami , 25 – who holds dual British and Iranian citizenship – was arrested with a number of other female fans who were peacefully demanding to be allowed into the match .
She was released after several hours in detention but re - arrested in late June when she went back to collect her mobile phone , which had been confiscated after the protest .
Nearly three months on , she remains in jail .
Amnesty International says she is being held in Tehran 's notorious Evin prison , where she was kept in solitary confinement for more than 40 days before being moved to a shared cell .
"" She is a prisoner of conscience , arrested solely for taking part in a peaceful protest against the ban on women attending volleyball world league matches in Tehran 's Azadi stadium , "" said Amnesty .
Iran does not recognise dual citizenship and treats all those with a second nationality solely as Iranian , denying them access to consular assistance .
The British Foreign Office is pursuing her release but has limited influence .
According to Amnesty , Ghavami has said that while she was kept in solitary confinement , "" the interrogators put her under psychological pressure , threatening to move her to Gharchak prison in the county of Varamin , Tehran province , where prisoners convicted of serious criminal offences are held in dismal conditions "" .
Shiva Nazar Ahari , a leading rights activist , was among the women protesting alongside Ghavami that day .
She has written on her Facebook page that their demand simply was to be allowed to enter the stadium .
"" We wanted to go to the stadium together .
We wanted to go sit on those chairs to scream and cheer for our national team , "" she wrote .
Ghavami 's lawyer , Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaee , told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran ( ICHRI ) , an independent US - based rights group : "" Unfortunately , I have not yet been allowed to visit with my client , and because she is still in the interrogation stage and no indictment has been issued , I do n't know her exact charges .
"" I hope , according to the discussions I have had , that Ms Ghavami is released on bail over the next few days .
I am optimistic . ""
A friend of Ghavami told the Guardian that her detention in Evin prison had recently been extended but it was not clear how much longer she could be held under Iranian law without being officially charged .
Iranian judicial authorities repeatedly disregard their own legal system , holding inmates without putting them on trial .
Local media has covered Ghavami 's detention , based on what has been reported outside Iran , but there is little information on her situation .
Bultan News , a website close to Iranian hardliners , said in a report with a familiar accusatory tone that she had been used by "" the west 's espionage services "" to spread chaos in Iran 's sociopolitical situation .
It did not elaborate whether that view was solely held by the website or was also shared by the authorities holding Ghavami , a law graduate from London University 's School of Oriental and African Studies .
Other Iranian women have also campaigned for female fans to be allowed to watch matches in stadiums .
In June 2011 , an Iranian photographer , Maryam Majd , was held by officials before boarding a flight from Iran at the airport for campaigning to allow women to enter stadiums alongside their countrymen .
Iran is particularly sensitive about the activities of dual citizens in the country and has arrested a number of them in recent years , including Amir Hekmati , an Iranian - American former US marine , and Jason Rezaian , an Iranian - American reporter for the Washington Post .
In May , it also emerged that another British - Iranian woman , Roya Saberinejad Nobakht , 47 , from Stockport , was jailed for her comments she wrote on Facebook and sentenced to 20 years .
These arrests are believed to have been carried out by Iran 's judicial and security apparatus , which operate independently of Rouhani 's government .
So far , however , the president has failed to act or speak out about their plight ."
2014-09-18,"Iran has intensified its criticism of the US - led coalition against the Islamic State ( Isis ) , with key officials saying they doubt Washington intends to destroy the terrorist group and the president calling it "" ridiculous "" .
Following Iran 's exclusion from an international conference in Paris aimed at confronting Isis , senior figures in the Islamic Republic have said the US - led coalition will do little against the group and is doomed to fail .
Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , described the US - led coalition against Isis as "" ridiculous "" in an interview with NBC News on Wednesday .
"" Are Americans afraid of getting casualties on the ground in Iraq ? "" he asked . ""
Are they afraid of their soldiers being killed in the fight they claim is against terrorism ? ""
Senior government and military officials in Tehran have in recent days argued the US 's Isis strategy is intended to deliver it a greater military presence in the Middle East .
Mohammad Ali Jafari , the commander of the powerful Revolutionary Guards , was quoted by the state - run Keyhan newspaper on Wednesday saying : "" We have serious doubts that the US 's intention is to obliterate [ Isis ] "" .
Iran 's foreign ministry spokeswoman , Marzieh Afkham , said : "" The pronounced goals of this coalition in the fight against terrorism are inconsistent with certain past and present deeds of its main architects and some of its members . ""
The Iranian officials , previously quiet about US handling of the Isis threat , have come forward since the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , made clear earlier in the week that there will be no military cooperation between Tehran and Washington , even though they are facing a common enemy .
Khamenei said earlier this week that the US 's "" hands were dirty and intentions murky "" .
Iran 's Revolutionary Guards have deployed members from their external arm – the Quds forces – in Iraq and Syria .
Iranian forces led by the Quds 's commander , Qassem Suleimani , are believed to have played a significant role in breaking the siege of Amerli , a town in northern Iraq , in recent months .
They have also been coordinating with Kurdish peshmerga fighters and engaged in skirmishes near the Iranian border with Iraq , where the Isis fighters had been posing a direct threat .
Suleimani , who is a strong ally of Khamenei , has developed a strong influence in Iraq , especially among its Shia militias , over the past decade .
Iran is particularly irked by recent comments made by US secretary of state , John Kerry , who said in Ankara last week that Tehran was a state sponsor of terror and that it was not appropriate for the country to participate in the Paris meeting .
Senior French diplomats have indicated that Iran 's presence at the conference was blocked by its political rival in the region , Saudi Arabia . ""
Under the circumstances , at this moment in time , it would not be right for any number of reasons .
It would not be appropriate given the many other issues that are on the table in Syria and elsewhere , "" Kerry said when asked about the prospects of having Iran in the conference .
Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) , speaking to the Guardian after attending a conference in Riyadh where the Iranain involvement had been discussed , said that the distrust between Tehran and the Persian Gulf Arabs remained very high . ""
The tone of the remarks at the conference I attended in Riyadh for the past two days was decisively against any cooperation with Iran , "" he told the Guardian . ""
The distrust with Iran remains very high from the Gulf Arabs , they would not have been pleased had Iran been invited to the Paris meeting . ""
Fitzpatrick said he is of the view that tacit cooperation with Iran agianst Isis makes sense but that those who believe that countries at the centre of the problem , like Iran , also really have to part of the solution are very much a minority among Arab leaders .
Despite American and Iranian denials of any military cooperation , the common battlefield in Iraq has made it difficult for the two countries not to cooperate , at least indirectly .
Fitzpatrick said that any such cooperation would not be likely to reach the extent to which Iran and the US shared intelligence to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan up until 2002 .
Despite such cooperation at that time , then US president , George W Bush , branded Iran as "" an exis of evil "" , prompting outrage in Tehran . ""
Iranians raise that at every opportunity , the sense of betrayal .
Just after having assisted the US in ousting the Taliban they were branded evil ; that shaped their memory and left a wound that is still festering , "" Fitzpatrick said ."
2014-09-22,"David Cameron is to hold the first bilateral talks between a British prime minister and an Iranian president since the 1979 revolution when he has a face to face meeting with President Hassan Rouhani in the next two days in New York .
The meeting , a significant thaw in diplomatic relations between the countries , is designed to explore the support the Iranians can give to the fight against Islamic State ( Isis ) in Iraq and Syria .
The Iranians were not allowed to attend the recent Paris talks on building an international coalition against Isis , and have also been excluded from all talks about dislodging President Bashar al - Assad in Syria , including the two conferences in Geneva .
Rouhani has been a fierce critic of Isis , but has derided the US air strikes campaign as it involves no commitment to ground forces .
Cameron is expected to make clear that Isis is a common and extremely serious threat that can only be tackled in Iraq and that Iran must drop its support for President Assad , who , in the words of Downing Street , has â€œcreated the conditions that have allowed terrorism to flourishâ€ � .
Cameron will also send a tough message to the Iranians on the long - running nuclear negotiations on behalf of the E3 + 3 group that : â€œIran has a rare opportunity to embolden its prosperity through a deal but this is only possible if Iran is willing to show flexibility and be realistic about the future scope of its nuclear programme , in particular the issue of enrichment.â€ �
No 10 sources said : â€œWe are under no illusion about the dangers of Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme and our approach on that is not changing .
However , if Iran is willing to join the international community to defeat Isis then we will work with them on that , but will be clear you can not take one approach in Baghdad and another in Damascus .
You need a political solution in both if you are serious about defeating Isis.â€ �
Speaking to NBC News from the presidential palace in Tehran before his visit to the UN , Rouhani questioned Barack
Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to go after Isis with air strikes .
â€œAre Americans afraid of giving casualties on the ground in Iraq ?
Are they afraid of their soldiers being killed in the fight they claim is against terrorism?â€ �
Rouhani said .
â€œIf they want to use planes and if they want to use unmanned planes so that nobody is injured from the Americans , is it really possible to fight terrorism without any hardship , without any sacrifice ?
Is it possible to reach a big goal without that ?
In all regional and international issues , the victorious one is the one who is ready to do sacrifice .
â€œMaybe it is necessary for air strikes in some conditions and some circumstances , â€ � he added .
â€œHowever , air strikes should take place with the permission of the people of that country and the government of that country.â€ �
No 10 said Cameron will also hold talks with Egyptian president Abdel Fattah elâ€‘Sisi on Tuesday .
He will say the UK wants to work with Egypt in the region , but can only do so when there are inclusive governments , strong institutions , safeguards for minorities and respect for human rights .
He will also use his visit to speak to US business executives in New York to launch a campaign for transatlantic prosperity through the conclusion of the elusive EU - US trade deal in 2015 .
The prime minister will speak at the UN climate summit on Tuesday .
The summit is trying to lay the groundwork for a global deal on climate change in Paris next year designed to keep the international community committed to a target of preventing the world warming by more than 2C. Cameron will insist each country should be allowed to make its own decision on energy promises , so long as they set overall carbon targets .
As part of the talks the prime minister will say the EU is planning to offer an emissions cut of 40 % .
No 10 sources said : â€œWe have got to go further in terms of explaining how tackling climate change is not simply a green policy â€ “ itâ€ ™ s a growth policy .
If you are going to get the world economies to stick to the 2C target you have got to be serious about cutting green tape and creating green jobs.â€ �"
2014-09-25,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , has said that if an agreement can be reached in the coming weeks on Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme it would clear the way for much greater Iranian cooperation with the west on combating the threat of Islamist extremism in the Middle East .
However , Rouhani told the UN general assembly that regional powers should lead the current battle against the Islamic State ( Isis ) in Syria and Iraq .
Western meddling in the region had led to the rise of violent extremism in the first place , he said , and if outsiders wanted to help fight extremism now they should support Iranian leadership .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s remarks came after a night of air strikes by the US and its Arab allies against oilfields controlled by Isis in the east of Syria .
Fighter jets struck oil facilities in and around the town of Mayadeen on Wednesday night , as well as the city of Deir el - Zor and the north - eastern province of al - Hasakah .
At least 19 people were killed , according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , five of them the wives and children of militants .
The strikes were designed to choke off a key source of revenue for Islamic State , which the US says earns up $ 2 m ( Â£1.2 m ) a day from smuggling oil to Turkey .
Later on Thursday it emerged that the US believes it has identified the British - accented masked Isis militant seen in videos depicting the beheadings of two American journalists and a British aid worker .
The FBIâ€ ™ s director , James Comey , would not reveal the manâ€ ™ s name or nationality .
In the three videos , the man holds a long knife and appears to begin cutting the three men , American reporters James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines .
The Pentagon said the latest overnight strikes in Syria were aimed at small - scale oil facilities held by Isis .
Six US warplanes and 10 from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia were involved in the strikes , which mainly hit targets in eastern Syria .
The Pentagon spokesman Read Admiral John Kirby said the US was investigating reports of civilian deaths .
Other strikes hit Isis checkpoints , compounds and vehicles in the north and east of Syria , including two military bases it had seized from Syrian government control .
The US was unable to say whether it had succeeded in disrupting the Khorasan group , part of the Nusra Front , an al - Qaida affiliate in Syria , targeted in strikes earlier this week .
The US , which hit Khorasan targets unilaterally in the early hours of Tuesday morning local time , has claimed the strikes were intended to thwart a plot against western interests .
But it has offered varied and conflicting accounts of that threat .
â€œThe assessment as to whether weâ€ ™ ve removed that threat or not is ongoing , â€ � said Mark Blackington , a spokesman for the US central command .
It remained unclear what Khorasan was thought to be planning , how far that planning had advanced and whether the US itself was a target .
Nor is the US confident as yet that it has either killed Khorasanâ€ ™ s leaders or significantly degraded any threat Khorasan may pose .
Kirby said : â€œI canâ€ ™ t say with extreme confidence that we know we have in fact disrupted a specific attack , but we definitely know we have hit targets that belong to them , were of use to them.â€

On the margins of the UN general assembly , negotiations have been continuing between Iran and six major powers aimed at reaching a breakthrough comprehensive agreement in which Iran would accept some curbs on its nuclear activity in return for relief from sanctions .
The talks face substantial obstacles : both sides are far apart on the question of what Iranâ€ ™ s uranium - enrichment capacity should be and which sanctions should be lifted first .
In his speech , Rouhani blamed the six powers â€ “ the US , UK , France , Germany , Russia and China â€ “ for being inflexible , saying they risked missing a â€œhistoric and exceptional opportunityâ€ � .
He said : â€œIf our interlocutors are motivated and flexible , we can reach a longstanding agreement within the time remaining .
Then an entirely different environment will emerge for cooperation at regional and international levels , for example in combating violence and extremism in region.â€ �
The president began his speech by blaming the rise of the Isis on the history of imperialism in the region and earlier western interventions such as the 2003 Iraq invasion .
He hinted that western intelligence agencies , which he did not name , may have helped the rise of Isis , using them to fight against the Syrian regime and â€œputting the blades in their handsâ€ � .
Although he did not deliver a direct condemnation of US - led air strikes against Isis , he argued that American leadership of the military campaign would only worsen the situation , as it would be done for the wrong motives .
â€œI believe if countries claiming leadership of the coalition are seeking to perpetuate their hegemony in the region , theyâ€ ™ d be making a strategic mistake , â€ � he said .
â€œDemocracy canâ€ ™ t be delivered in a backpack .
Itâ€ ™ s not a commodity to be exported from west to east .
It needs a foundation.â€ �
He added that if â€œwe fail to entrust the job to the people in the region who can do the job , tomorrow the world will be safe for no one.â€ �
Franceâ€ ™ s defence minister , Jean - Yves Le Drian , said France would consider carrying out air strikes against Isis inside Syria .
Until now , Paris has joined the US - led coalition that has been bombing Isis positions in Iraq , but had ruled out similar military action in Syria .
On Thursday , Le Drian said Franceâ€ ™ s priority remained Iraq , but he did not entirely dismiss adding Syria to the list of targets , saying it was â€œa question that has been askedâ€ � .
He added : â€œItâ€ ™ s not something thatâ€ ™ s on the table today .
We already have an important job to do in Iraq .
Weâ€ ™
ll see how the situation evolves.â€ �
There was widespread outrage in France over the murder of HervÃ
© Gourdel , a French tourist , by a jihadi group linked to Isis in Algeria .
The president , FranÃ§ois Hollande , described the killing of the 55-year - old as â€œcowardly , cruel and shamefulâ€ � .
Gourdelâ€ ™
s
killers decapitated their hostage 48 hours after their deadline for France to accede to demands to stop bombing Isis in Iraq .
On Thursday Hollande said the air strikes would continue ."
2014-09-27,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , gave qualified support to western military action against Isis inside Iraq , saying a concerted campaign could be successful as long as it was requested by the Iraqi government .
Speaking to journalists in New York while attending the UN general assembly , Rouhani appeared to draw a sharp distinction between Syria , where the Assad regime had not been informed of US air strikes , let alone asking for them ; and Iraq , where the new government has formally called for military assistance .
He criticised western states for responding late to Iraqâ€ ™ s call for help , claiming Iran had been the first to come to its defence and helped prevent Irbil and Baghdad falling to Isis .
He also questioned the value of relying on aerial power alone .
But when asked whether western military intervention would be welcome under any conditions , the Iranian president said : â€œWhatever steps they take , the legitimate sovereign government of the country must be informed and give its genuine consent .
â€œWe must support any government that requests assistance , â€ � Rouhani said .
â€œThe request must come from Iraq .
If the sovereignty of the Iraqi government is made central , the campaign can be successful.â€
�
The president bristled at being asked whether Iran would assist a western military campaign , saying the question should be posed the other way round : would the West help Iran .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve actually been the ones countering terrorism in the region for years , â€ �
he said .
â€œHad it not been for Iranâ€ ™ s timely assistance , many of the Iraqi cities would have fallen to the hands of these vicious terrorists.â€ � Rouhani added that the time â€œwasnâ€ ™ t rightâ€ � for another phone conversation or a meeting with US president Barack Obama â€œbecause of the sensitivity that still exists between the two countriesâ€ � , Associated Press reported .
One year ago , Obama and Rouhani spoke by telephone for 15 minutes after the Iranian leaderâ€ ™ s first appearance at the UN general assemblyâ€ ™ s annual meeting of world leaders .
It was the first time the presidents of the United States and Iran had talked directly since the 1979 Iranian revolution and siege of the American embassy .
The conversation was hailed as an historic breakthrough .
But Rouhani , questioned about a repeat conversation at a news conference on Friday before heading home after this yearâ€ ™ s ministerial meeting , said : â€œNot a meeting nor a telephone call had been included in the agenda nor been planned for , ... nor intended to be a part of our visit this year.â€ �
Rouhani said there must be substantive reasons with â€œhigh objectivesâ€ � for conversations between world leaders .
If not , he said , â€œtelephone calls are somewhat meaninglessâ€ � .
The Iranian president said the time is not ripe as there still is too much sensitivity between the two countries .
A phone conversation between the two leaders â€œwould only be constructive and fruitful when it is done according to a precisely laid plan with precisely clearly stated objectives , â€ �
Rouhani said .
â€œOtherwise it will never be constructive or effective.â€ �
An important first step would be for Iran and six major powers including the United States to reach agreement on the countryâ€ ™ s disputed nuclear program .
He said progress so far â€œhas not been significant , â€ � and the pace must be speeded up if the 24 November deadline for a final agreement is to be reached ."
2014-09-30,"Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has criticised the British prime minister , David Cameron , a week after a landmark meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of the UN general assembly .
Rouhani said it was unacceptable and wrong for Cameron to say , within hours of them meeting in New York , that Tehran was â€œpart of the problemâ€ � in the Middle East .
In his closing speech at the general assembly last Thursday , the UK prime minister said Tehranâ€ ™ s support for what he said were terrorist organisations had to change , although he added that Iran could help the west in its fight against Islamic State ( Isis ) .
That meeting marked a milestone in Tehran and Londonâ€ ™ s relations , which have been strained since the 1979 Islamic revolution , but Cameronâ€ ™ s comments upset Tehran hardliners and embarrassed Rouhani at home .
â€œIran should also be given the chance to show it can be part of the solution , not part of the problem , â€ �
Cameron said during his speech , according to a transcript published on the governmentâ€ ™ s website .
â€œWe have severe disagreements .
Iranâ€ ™ s support for terrorist organisations , its nuclear programme , its treatment of its people .
All these need to change.â€ � Rouhani , who was speaking to reporters after arriving in Tehran from a conference in the Russian city of Astrakhan , said the request for the meeting was made by the British prime minister .
â€œHe had asked for a meeting and we had agreed and that was how we met ,
â€ �
he said late on Monday .
â€œHe made comments later at his [ UN ] speech which were wrong and unacceptable , â€ �
Rouhani told Iranian reporters , according to Iranâ€ ™ s state television .
Rouhani said having different opinions over political issues was normal .
He added : â€œWe live in the 21st century .
If someone wants to go back and think in the ways of the 19th century , thatâ€ ™ s their own
loss.â€ �
Cameron went on in his speech to say that Tehran could help the west with the Isis threat .
â€œIranâ€ ™ s leaders could help in defeating the threat from Isil [ Isis ] .
They could help secure a more stable , inclusive Iraq , and a more stable and inclusive Syria .
And if they are prepared to do this , then we should welcome their engagement.â€ �
Cameronâ€ ™ s speech at the UN prompted an immediate reaction from Iranâ€ ™ s foreign ministry last week but Mondayâ€ ™ s remarks were the first by Rouhani .
Following Cameronâ€ ™ s speech , the Iranian foreign ministerâ€ ™ s spokeswoman , Marzieh Afkham , said many of the dilemmas in the Middle East today were the result of the policies adopted by Britain in the past .
â€œThe speech by the British prime minister at the UN general assembly shows the perpetuation of the egocentric attitude of a government which has a history of [ causing ] trouble in our region , â€ �
she said on Thursday , according to Iranâ€ ™ s English - language television Press TV .
Given the significance of the talks , Rouhani had to weigh up every step he took as he met the British prime minister .
And choice of words has huge repercussions in Tehran .
Iranian hardliners are deeply sceptical of British politics and have long accused London of interfering in Tehranâ€ ™ s internal affairs .
In the Iranian hardlinersâ€ ™ view , Cameronâ€ ™ s comments indicated that Rouhani was wrong to meet him in New York .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not surprising to be tricked by the old fox , â€ � the hardline news agency SNN said , referring to Britain by an old nickname used by some Iranian hardliners .
â€œCameron didnâ€ ™ t even wait for the ice of London - Tehran ties to thaw , â€ � SNN said .
The conservative Vatan - e - Emrooz newspaper said Cameron had insulted Iran and published a front - page depicting a picture of the meeting with the headline : â€œThe fox kicks.â€ �"
2014-10-06,"When Iranian students began classes on 23 September , the ministry of science , research , and technology â€ “ which oversees higher education
â€ “ had no minister .
Iranâ€ ™ s parliament sacked the incumbent Reza Farajidana in August , reflecting anxiety among conservative deputies over renewed political unrest among students .
President Hassan Rouhani seemed unperturbed .
Hours after Farajidanaâ€ ™ s removal , he appointed him as his special adviser on science and education , and as acting minister , Rouhani chose Mohammad - Ali Najafi , a prominent reformist who was last year turned down by parliament after Rouhani nominated him as minister of education .
In mid - September , three weeks after Farajidanaâ€ ™ s removal , I met a former head of a students association , whom I shall call simply Alireza , who is currently working toward a masterâ€ ™ s degree at Tarbiat Modares university , Tehran .
Alireza has close ties to some in the Mosharekat ( the Participation Front ) , the main reformist party suspended since 2010 , and expressed satisfaction with the beginning of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s presidency .
He particularly praised the work of Jafar Towfighi , Farajidanaâ€ ™ s most senior advisor who resigned when the minister was removed .
Alireza cited the work Towfighi took on in reinstating so - called â€˜starâ€ ™ students , those who fell victim to a practice introduced in 2006 under the fundamentalist president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad under which some politically active students were given â€˜starsâ€ ™ blocking them from higher - level university studies .
â€œOne of his plans was the return of the â€˜starâ€ ™ students , â€ � Alireza explained .
â€œWhen he started work
it was announced that around 1,000 people had received these stars , but there was no way all of them could be brought back as the authorities would have had to have come up with 1,000 empty places .
â€œSo it was decided that the students who received stars after 2011 could reapply with the same entry exam score , whereas those who received the stars before 2011 would have the chance to take the entry exam again .
In my opinion it this was a rational decision , which worked out for many people , and itâ€ ™ s been one of the achievements of the Rouhani administration.â€ �
Tensions between reformist students and Iranâ€ ™ s conservatives can be traced to 1999 , two years after Mohammad Khatamiâ€ ™ s victory in the 1997 presidential elections , when students held the countryâ€ ™ s largest political demonstrations since the 1979 Revolution .
But in more recent times , the bad feeling goes back to the role played by many students in the 2009 protests following Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s disputed re - election .
Fundamentalists felt demonstrators had crossed a red line and thereafter dubbed the Green movement â€œseditionistsâ€ � .
The term has been applied widely enough to include reformists who did not back street protest .
With the victory of Rouhani in the 2013 election , the reformists who had supported his campaign were delighted with his approach to the ministry of science .
But the new president faced resistance .
As Alireza explained , after Jafar Mili Mofared was blocked by parliament , Rouhani appointed Towfighi as acting minister , and for a while Towfighi practically took over the ministry and was assumed to be Rouhaniâ€ ™ s next choice for the position .
During that time , he suggested in letters responding to student organisations that he would reinstate teachers and students expelled for participating in the demonstrations after the 2009 election .
But Rouhani instead appointed Farajidana .
This may have been because of likely opposition to Towfighi , whose appointment instead as an advisor provoked a letter of protest signed by 150 deputies .
The new team pressed on .
Over the past year , the ministry has removed around 20 of the university presidents appointed during the Ahmadinejad presidency , especially in the capital , including the University of Tehran , University of the Arts , Amir Kabir , Alameh Tabatabaei , Khajeh Nasir , and the Technology and Industry University .
Reformist students have welcomed this .
â€œGetting rid of those monsters passing themselves off as university presidents was certainly a net positive , â€ � said Monireh , a 20-year - old construction student at Technology and Industry .
â€œAlthough the ministry could have been more forceful in purging the universities of those types and in picking their substitutes.â€ � Sareh , a 21-year - old student at Khajeh Nasir , is more satisfied with the new administration , saying pressure on women students over their clothing has eased .
During the Ahmadinejad presidency , she said , â€œthey harassed us to no end .
The dorms and food were a hellish nightmare , and the idiots in the herasat [ a committee at each university responsible for enforcing moral values and standards ] bothered everyone about hijab , makeup , eye shadow and what have you .
This year we finally had a chance to breathe.â€ �
The underlying issue for reformist students is the need for renewed political participation , especially through the Islamic students associations .
These emerged in the years following the 1979 Revolution as the most important groups on campuses , with their leaders participating in the public council of the Tahkim - e Vahdat ( Office for Strengthening Unity ) , one of the largest and most influential student organisations in Iran .
The ISAs and the Tahkim - e Vahdat worked in tandem during the first two decades after the revolution to implement the new regimeâ€ ™ s policies in higher education .
Even before Khatamiâ€ ™ s election in 1997 , they inclined to the reformists , and after 2001 , when Khatami won a second term , Tahkim - e Vahdat demanded more radical reforms than Khatami had proposed .
Between 2005 and 2009 , with Ahmadinejad as president , Tahkim - e Vahdat criticised his government , and as a consequence faced intense pressure and the suspension of many members .
After the suppression of the Green movement following the 2009 unrest , the authorities suspended all activities of the Islamic students associations or imposed members of the Basij Islamic militia as their presidents .
Alireza says that the Rouhani government has not come close during the past year to rehabilitating the ISAs .
â€œThey went all to hell during the Ahmadinejad presidency , and right after Rouhani won the presidency , a few different groups took matters into their own hands and started trying to revive the ISAs.â€
�
But there was no overall plan .
â€œEveryone had their own ways of trying to do it , â€ � said Alireza .
â€œOne group , linked with the University of Tehran , was close to the Khatami reformists and had connections in the ministry .
A second group , from Tahkim - e Vahdat , had an active media strategy , but the ministry officials were ultimately afraid of being too close to them .
â€œA third group was the Tahkim usurpers from the Ahmadinejad days : they were led by a guy who claimed to be a reformist but who was really close to Ahmadinejad and [ Ayatollah Ali ] Khamenei
[ Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader ] .
They even met with [ former president Akbar ]
Hashemi Rafsanjani under the name
â€˜The Line of the Imamâ€ ™ [ a designation used by students during the 1979 Revolution to express their allegiance to its leader , Ayatollah Rohollah Khomeini].â€ �
Alireza is disappointed with this aspect of the Rouhani administration , and refers to statements made by two leading officials in the ministry , Hadi Khaniki and Gholamreza Zarifian .
â€œThey have said that there wonâ€ ™ t really be any opening until next winter , so weâ€ ™ ll just see what happens then .
They gave licenses to a few student groups whoâ€ ™ re using the name - â€˜The Islamic Students Associations in the Line of the Imamâ€ ™ .â€ �
Mohsen , an activist at the Ferdowsi University at Mashhad , eastern Tehran , told Tehran Bureau that morale among reformist students was improving but that confidence was fragile .
â€œIf the organisations
donâ€ ™ t hurry up and organise properly , theyâ€ ™ ll be disappointed .
In any case they didnâ€ ™ t get much support from the officials , who have just asked the students to be patient.â€ �
But a political analyst working on student issues in a reformist publishing house in Tehran emphasised that Rouhani and the next minister will have little chance of keeping the students quiet .
â€œThe middle class has suffered a series of crises since 2009 , which have led them to resort to collective action and demand change .
These actions are uncontrollable .
The students are no exception and are in fact even more likely to participate vigorously - and be willing to pay the price of that participation - due to their age and their idealism .
If theyâ€ ™ ve remained silent in the face of this new government , itâ€ ™ s because they are waiting for the right moment .
They donâ€ ™ t want to make any serious moves before the end of the nuclear negotiations that would elicit a reaction from [ fundamentalist ] extremists.â€ � Talks with world powers , said the analyst , are therefore setting a rough timetable .
â€œThe negotiations will eventually end , either in agreement or failure , and Rouhani will no longer have any excuse for delay in opening up the political atmosphere.â€ �"
2014-11-12,"Iran ’s president , Hassan Rouhani , has asked the US to stop making “ excessive demands ” in the negotiations over the country ’s nuclear programme , saying Tehran had already made enough compromises to reach a permanent settlement with the west when the two sides meet next week .
Rouhani told his cabinet on Wednesday that the Iranian team would not retreat from the “ people ’s rights ” when it travelled to Vienna to meet with diplomats from six major powers for what many see as a make - or - break moment .
“
Iran has made its utmost efforts and made the necessary adjustments to its demands and we hope that all the P5 + 1 countries , particularly the US , which occasionally seeks excessive demands in the nuclear talks , will understand the circumstances , ” Rouhani said , according to the state - run Press TV .
Since sealing an interim nuclear agreement last year , Iran and the US , France , Germany , China , Russia and Britain – the group known as P5 + 1 – have held intensive talks aimed at finding a final deal to end the decades - long dispute over Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Both sides have set 24 November as a self - imposed deadline for the talks and despite big differences , they are hoping to reach agreement by then .
The US secretary of state , John Kerry , met Iran ’s foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , and the EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton in the Omani capital , Muscat , earlier this week .
It was not clear how those talks went and there was no indication of a breakthrough .
Rouhani told his ministers that countries looking for excuses to prevent Iran making further nuclear advances would fail to do so .
“ Our nation will never give up the path of development and its rights , ” the Iranian president said , adding that he hoped for an agreement that would benefit Iran and other countries .
Iran has been adamant that it would not allow any agreement to prevent it obtaining nuclear technology permitted by the non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) .
But Iran and the west have different interpretations of what type of advances are permitted under the NPT , especially over enrichment capacity .
On Tuesday , Russia sealed a deal with Iran to build at least two more nuclear reactors in Bushehr , on the Gulf .
This is already home to a Russian - built reactor that is the country ’s only nuclear power station .
The agreement was signed in Moscow between the head of Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organisation , Ali Akbar Salehi , and Sergey Kirienko of Russia ’s State Atomic Energy Corporation ( Rosatom ) .
Salehi described the agreement , which encompasses the construction of six more reactors in the future , as a turning point in relations between Tehran and Moscow .
The outcome of the Vienna talks will have direct consequences at home for Rouhani .
He owes his victory in last year ’s presidential elections to promises of ending the nuclear crisis , which would in turn lead to the gradual lifting of sanctions .
Despite the interim agreement , the bulk of the sanctions regime remains intact and Tehran has severe problems selling oil , its primary export .
Rouhani said the midterm elections in the US , which gave the Republicans outright control over the Senate , was a domestic issue for the Americans and should not interfere with talks .
“
It is none of our business that one of the countries of the P5 + 1 has internal problems and have lost or gain in an election .
Countries have to solve their internal problems within themselves .
“"
2014-11-14,"Outside the former US embassy ’s compound in Tehran – now a museum called “ den of spies
” – hundreds of Iranians gathered last week to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the hostage crisis , when 52 American diplomats were held captive for 444 days .
A number of senior Iranian officials , mostly from the Conservative Front , were among the crowds railing against “ the Great Satan ” .
But President Hassan Rouhani , whose government has engaged in direct diplomacy with the US over Tehran ’s nuclear programme , was not among them .
There remains a deep suspicion of the US in Iran , but even the most conservative factions of the Islamic republic hope for a way out of the current nuclear stalemate .
A few hours of marching and chanting “ death to America ” and “ death to Israel ” ended with the participants issuing a statement expressing their support for the president ’s nuclear diplomacy and his negotiating team , who are travelling to Vienna next week in what amounts to a critical moment in the latest round of nuclear talks .
Speculation is high about what will happen there .
Mohammad
Marandi , a Tehran University professor close to the Iranian establishment , told the Guardian that Iranians wanted the negotiations to succeed and that in his view , the Americans could not afford for them to fail .
“
I do n’t think that the talks will fail because the United States is facing too much trouble .
Americans and Europeans are facing major economic problems at home , tensions with Russia are very high , Russia and China are moving towards Iran , tensions with China are gradually increasing over the South China Sea and of course the US - Saudi alliance has led to the Isil [ Isis ] disaster that is a major security threat to western countries .
I do n’t think the Americans are really in a position to escalate tensions .
”
Seyed Hossein Mousavian , a former spokesperson for Iran ’s nuclear negotiating team who has worked with Rouhani in the past , said a nuclear agreement in Vienna would strengthen the Iranian president ’s administration .
Rouhani owes his victory in last year ’s presidential elections to promises of ending the nuclear crisis .
Mousavian told the Guardian : “ It would have a great impact on the economic situation , improve the image of the US and the west in Iran , would open the door for broader cooperation with the world powers on the regional crisis and would be a great achievement for the Iranian administration .
”
Last month , a group of Iranian and foreign investors gathered in London ’s Iran - EU forum studying business opportunities in the Islamic republic should the talks bear fruit and international companies could return to Iran .
Esfandyar Batmanghelidj , who organised that event , struck a more optimistic note and said investors were hoping for a return .
“
I think the mood is cautiously optimistic , ” he told the Guardian .
“
Everyone is following the talks .
There ’s an interesting situation where they are following the political analysis , they are keeping up to date with the news and people are hopeful the P5 + 1 [ UK , China , France , Germany , Russia and US ] and Iran are serious about coming to an agreement but however many positive signs there are , there are also worrying signs like the outcome of the elections in the US and the very significant resistance to the deal that is coming from certain special interest groups .
”
According to Batmanghelidj , if the negotiations lead to a comprehensive deal that includes easing sanctions , there will be a great deal of business opportunities in Iran .
“
Typically when individuals are talking about the opportunities in Iran , the first thing people think is of is big oil and energy contracts
but I think the real opportunities and the one that is going to mean the most for Iran in the long term in terms of it developing into an advanced economy , is opportunities around Iran ’s consumer marketplace , ” he said .
“
It ’s a country of 80 million people – young , educated , they have pretty good purchasing power .
They are hungry for the best international products and brands , everything from cosmetics to cars to healthcare products , I think the industries that touch the end consumer are going to be the ones that are most successful .
”
Amir Ali Handjani , an Iranian - American energy executive based in Dubai , said foreign companies were waiting on the sidelines to see if the negotiations with Iran and the P5 + 1 culminate with a deal .
“
Until then multinational companies will remain on the sidelines and look for a clear and unambiguous signal from their respective governments that the political process is going forward in a positive direction and it ’s permissible to enter the Iranian market – without that green light the risk far outweighs the rewards , ” he said .
“
I think if there ’s a deal , internally there ’s going to be some jockeying for position to both implement it and block it by different factions in Tehran .
I do think that if there ’s a gradual lifting of sanctions , business will return to Iran as long as they receive a green light from their respective governments that they will not be penalised , fined or targeted for doing business with Iran .
”
But if the talks fail , Handjani said Iran ’s economy would suffer a lot .
“
If the talks fail , Iran is going to suffer tremendously because the economy is hitting a perfect storm of sanctions , lower oil prices , inflation and devaluation of the rial .
With the declining price of oil , Iran ’s revenue base is dwindling .
It is not able to sell its oil unencumbered and when it does it is not able to access the proceeds of its sale freely . ”"
2015-01-21,"The Iranian government has acknowledged that the US is genuinely willing to reach a comprehensive agreement with Tehran , in an unusual assessment of the progress of the ongoing nuclear talks .
It comes after Barack Obama threatened to veto any new sanctions bill that the congress may impose on Tehran , and as Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , was strongly criticised at home for taking a stroll with his American counterpart .
The Iranian governmentâ€ ™ s
spokesman , Mohammad Bagher Nobakht , who is a close ally of the countryâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , told reporters on Wednesday that Tehran viewed the US administration as determined to end the nuclear standoff with Iran .
â€œWe are seeking the Iranian peopleâ€ ™ s rights in the nuclear negotiations and our assessment show that they , especially the Americans , have the will to reach an agreement with Iran , â€ �
he said , according to the semi - official Fars news agency .
Nobakhtâ€ ™
s comments were rare remarks reflecting Tehranâ€
™ s view of where the other side stands in the nuclear talks .
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday , Obama said new sanctions by the US congress will only jeopardise the chance to peacefully end the nuclear stalemate with Tehran through diplomacy .
â€œBetween now and
this spring , we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear - armed Iran , secures America and our allies â€ “ including Israel â€ “ while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict .
There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed , and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran , â€ � he said .
â€œBut new sanctions passed by this Congress , at this moment in time , will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails â€ “ alienating America from its allies , making it harder to maintain sanctions , and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again .
It doesnâ€ ™ t make sense .
And thatâ€ ™ s why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.â€ �
In the latest round of nuclear talks , Zarif , who is also Iranâ€ ™ s lead nuclear negotiator , met the US secretary of state , John Kerry , for several hours in Geneva last week .
On the sidelines of those talks , Zarif and Kerry took a stroll in the city , which marked rare scenes of the two top officials from the old adversaries having a break together outside negotiations behind closed doors .
In Tehran , pictures of Zarif and Kerry walking in downtown Geneva prompted criticism from the hardline camp , with Mohammad Reza Naqdi , the commander of Iranâ€ ™ s informal voluntary Basij militia , who is a close confidant of the Iranian supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , attacking the Iranian foreign minister for that stroll .
â€œApparently , Mr Zarif doesnâ€ ™ t know what kind of a nation he is representing , â€ � Naqdi was quoted as saying by the Dana news agency .
â€œHe must apologise to the Iranian people for his inappropriate actions.â€ �
Nobakht was questioned on Wednesday about the controversies surrounding the stroll .
The Isna news agency quoted him as responding : â€œIt is silly to say that our diplomacy is weak because these two officials took a stroll.â€ �
This sort of criticism was not supported by Iranian people , he said ."
2015-02-03,"Iranâ€ ™ s parliament is considering a bill requiring the government led by Hassan Rouhani , the president , to halt implementation of the interim nuclear agreement with the west if the US imposes further sanctions .
The bill is a retaliatory plan designed by hardline Iranian MPs in case US Congress passes its proposed legislation for fresh sanctions against Tehran , which Barack Obama has promised to veto .
Parliamentarians in Iran voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday in favour of a motion to fast - track examining the bill , which aims â€œto protect the nuclear rights and achievements of Iranian peopleâ€ � .
It was not clear when exactly they will vote on the bill itself .
Under the Iranian proposal , if the US Congress approves new sanctions , the Iranian government will immediately be obliged to stop implementing the November 2013 nuclear agreement , known as the Joint Plan of Action .
Under such a circumstance , Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government will also have to step up the countryâ€ ™ s enrichment programme and continue with the development of the heavy water reactor at Arak , which are both subject to limits under the existing interim deal .
Legislatures in both countries are trying to set their own conditions as diplomats continue talks .
In Washington , a bipartisan bill co - authored by senator Robert Menendez , a Democrat , and senator Mark Kirk , a Republican , seeks further sanctions on Iran if the ongoing negotiations fail to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of June .
The Kirk - Menendez bill will authorise new sanctions only in the event of talks collapsing .
Obama made clear in his State of the Union address last month that he will veto the bill if it passes Congress because , he said , it will only jeopardise the chance to end the nuclear stalemate with Tehran through diplomacy .
â€œNew sanctions passed by this Congress , at this moment in time , will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails â€ “ alienating America from its allies , making it harder to maintain sanctions , and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear programme again , â€ � he said .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t make sense .
And thatâ€ ™ s why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.â€ �
Since Obamaâ€ ™ s warning , a number of Democrats , who are supporting the bill , have said they will wait until at least the end of March before voting in favour of the proposed legislation .
Without the help of the Democrats , the bill will fail to gather a veto - proof majority .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s administration has faced similar challenges , with the conservative - dominated parliament setting its own red lines for the talks .
Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , who acts as the lead Iranian nuclear negotiator , has recently been criticised by MPs for taking a stroll with his American counterpart , John Kerry , on the sidelines of the latest round of talks in Geneva .
Rouhani has strongly defended his negotiating team , accusing his critics at home of â€œcheering onâ€ � the other side and sabotaging the talks .
â€œThe other side applauds their own , but here in our country , it is not clear what [ the critics ] are doing .
It is as if they are cheering on the rival team , â€ � he said , according to the state Irna news agency .
â€œAnd when we ask them what they are doing , they answer : â€˜We are criticising , and criticism is a good thing.â€ ™
This is not criticism , it is sabotage of national interests and favour for partisan politics.â€ �
Negotiations have continued on different levels since January as both sides try to bridge gaps to reach a framework deal by the beginning of March .
The deadline for a comprehensive agreement is 1 July ."
2015-02-03,"President Hassan Rouhani has said that a nuclear deal with the west is getting closer , as a report emerged of a possible compromise between American and Iranian negotiators over uranium enrichment .
After meeting the heads of the countryâ€ ™ s parliament and judiciary , Rouhani was quoted by the Mehr news agency as saying : â€œWe have narrowed the gaps ,
â€ � adding that although â€œsome issues and differences remain ...
The west has realised that it should recognise the rights of the Iranian people.â€ �
Even Ali Larijani , the parliamentary speaker and a noted hardliner on nuclear talks , declared himself â€œnot pessimisticâ€ � about the trajectory of the negotiations .
Nuclear talks between Iran and six major powers are due to resume later this month in Geneva ahead of a March deadline for arriving at a basic framework agreement .
A comprehensive permanent settlement would be reached by the end of June .
The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that US and Iranian negotiators have been discussing a compromise that could break the main impasse to an agreement over Iranâ€ ™ s capacity to enrich uranium .
Iran has been adamant that it will not accept a major reduction to its current capacity of about 10,000 operational centrifuges .
Meanwhile , the US and its allies have been pushing for less than 4,000 , on the grounds that any greater capacity would allow Iran to enrich enough weapons - grade uranium for a bomb within a year , should Tehran decide to build a nuclear arsenal .
The possible compromise under consideration , according to the AP , would see most of the 10,000 centrifuges in operation left in place but reconfigured so that they would be less productive .
One way of doing that would be to spin the centrifuges more slowly .
Other measures would be agreed upon to reassure the west that Iran could not make a warhead quickly , such as reducing its stockpile of uranium hexafluoride gas â€ “ the form in which uranium can be enriched by centrifuge .
Some observers have cautioned against interpreting the report as a sign of an imminent breakthrough .
â€œI think this report is reading too much into some of the innovative ideas that have been on the table , but not yet finalized , â€ � said Ali Vaez , an Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group .
â€œThe negotiators are no longer moving in circles .
Itâ€ ™ s more like an upward spiral now .
But there is no silver bullet solution that can all of a sudden resolve the enrichment
issue.â€ �
Enrichment capacity is not the only sticking point at the talks .
Iran is also demanding that the west lift sanctions faster than the timetable that has been put forward .
The deadline for the negotiations to be completed has already been extended seven months , after the parties failed to reach an accord in Vienna last November .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government in Tehran and the Obama administration in Washington are alike negotiating under heavy pressure from hardliners in both camps .
The Republican majority in Congress has asked the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , to come to Washington next month to make the case against a deal , in what is widely seen a powerful challenge to Obamaâ€ ™ s authority , but the White House has managed to persuade congressional Democrats to fend off a vote on new sanctions until the end of March , pending the outcome of the Geneva talks .
Iranâ€ ™ s parliament , the Majlis , meanwhile , voted on Tuesday to fast - track its own retaliatory legislation , which would , if adopted , escalate
Iranâ€ ™ s
nuclear programme and jettison an interim deal reached in 2013 , known as the Joint Plan of Action , that was designed to impose limits on enrichment and other activities until a comprehensive agreement could be reached .
Under the legislation being prepared in the Majlis , Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government would be obliged to respond to any new US sanctions by expanding uranium enrichment and accelerating development of the heavy water reactor at Arak , which is capable of producing plutonium ."
2015-02-10,"A suffocating dust storm sweeping across western Iran has disrupted life in an unprecedented fashion , closing down schools and government offices , bringing flights to a standstill and provoking protests .
A large group of people in the western city of Ahwaz , the capital of Iran ’s oil - rich Khuzestan province , gathered in protest at the government ’s handling of the environmental crisis on Tuesday .
Protesters demanded the administration of President Hassan Rouhani to act , holding up placards saying that “ healthy air is our right ” .
Many others took to social networking websites such as Twitter and Facebook , sharing harrowing pictures of how ordinary citizens are grappling with an enormous amount of dust and sand in the air , which are reported to be tens of times above the healthy limit .
“
We are breathing dust here , not oxygen , ” said one Twitter user .
“
It is really , really terrifying , ” said another .
As well as Khuzestan , the dust storm has also hit other western Iranian provinces , such as Ilam , Lorestan , Kurdistan and Kermanshah .
In Khuzestan many are using # KhouzestanCantBreathe on Twitter to bring their problem to the nation ’s attention .
Others wrote messages on car bonnets and other surfaces covered with dust and posted them online .
Shahriar Askari , an official with Khuzestan ’s environmental protection organisation , told the state Irna news agency that the amount of dust in the air on Tuesday was 66 times above the healthy level .
Citizens are advised to stay indoors or wear face masks when going outside .
A combination of drought , shrinking wetlands and overall environmental deterioration in neighbouring Iraq and Saudi Arabia are blamed for the situation in western Iran ."
2015-02-17,"Iranâ€ ™ s media has been banned from publishing the name or images of Mohammad Khatami , the countryâ€ ™ s reformist former president , according to a senior judicial official .
Although the authorities have taken similar actions against reformers and opposition figures in the past , the latest move is significant because it is happening under the current moderate president , Hassan Rouhani , who had promised greater freedoms .
Gholam - Hossein Mohseni - Ejeâ€ ™
i , the spokesman for Iranâ€ ™ s judiciary , said on Monday
that Tehranâ€ ™ s justice department had issued a ruling that prohibits any mentions of Khatami in the Iranian media .
Iranâ€ ™ s judicial system , which is dominated by conservatives , operates separately from Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government , meaning that the presidentâ€ ™
s hands are tied when it comes to influencing its decisions .
â€œThere is an order that bans the media from publishing photos or reports about this person , â€ �
Mohseni - Ejeâ€ ™
i said , referring to Khatami without naming him , according to the semi - official Isna news agency .
Isna , too , did not name Khatami in its report of the spokesmanâ€ ™ s briefing with Iranian reporters but referred to him as â€œthe leader of the reformist governmentâ€ � .
Khatami has fallen foul of the establishment because of his support for Iranâ€ ™ s opposition leaders and former presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , who have been under house arrest since February 2011 .
Mousaviâ€ ™ s wife , Zahra Rahnavard , also a prominent opposition figure , is under house arrest , too .
It is not the first time the authorities have banned mentions of Khatami in the Iranian media .
In 2010 , a similar ruling was issued against publishing the names or images of Khatami as well Mousavi , Rahnavard and Karroubi , but restrictions were relaxed around the time of the last presidential elections in 2013 .
Khatami backed Rouhani in those elections and his support was crucial in the victory of the moderate cleric .
Following Rouhaniâ€ ™ s win , Khatami wrote an article for the Guardian in which he urged the west to work with the new president in order to end the standoff over Tehranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
Mohseni - Ejeâ€ ™
i did not specifically mention whether the new round of censorship also applied to the opposition leaders but it is widely assumed that they are blacklisted too .
The Iranian agencies that report any developments in the situation of Mousavi , Karroubi and Rahnavard simply refer to their case as â€œthe issue of house arrestâ€ � without publishing their names .
Hardliners have adopted the term â€œleaders of seditionâ€ � in reference to the leaders under house arrest instead of directly mentioning their names .
Many hardliners consider Khatami to be a part of that group .
Unlike Mousavi and Karroubi , Khatami has not been placed under house arrest but faces other restrictions , including being barred from leaving the country .
All the men have held high - profile jobs in the Islamic republic .
Mousavi was prime minister in the 80s , Khatami led a reformist administration between 1997 and 2005 , and Karroubi was a speaker of the parliament .
During his presidential campaign , Rouhani said he believed the house arrests of opposition leaders should be lifted but he has done little to address the issue .
This February marks four years since Mousavi , Karroubi and Rahnavard were placed under house arrest without being charged or put on trial .
A decision to release them rests in the hands of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the ultimate authority in Iran .
Censorship is prohibited under the Islamic republicâ€ ™ s constitution but the country has one of the worldâ€ ™ s worst records of press freedom , with dozens of journalists and bloggers currently held behind bars .
Mardom - e - Emrooz , a reformist daily , was closed down in January because it had shown solidarity with the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo following the deadly shootings at its offices ."
2015-03-04,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , has reacted to Binyamin Netanyahuâ€ ™ s speech to the US Congress by saying that the world and the American people are too intelligent to take advice from â€œan aggressive and occupier regimeâ€ � that has itself developed an arsenal of nuclear weapons .
â€œThe world is happy with the progress in the negotiations between Iran and the P5 + 1,â€ �
Rouhani said in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday , speaking about the nuclear talks between Iran and the US , France , Germany , China , Russia and Britain .
â€œOnly one aggressive and occupier regime [ Israel ] is angry with the talks because it sees its existence tied with war and
occupation.â€ �
Rouhani said : â€œPeople of the world and America are too smart to take advice from such a war - mongering regime â€ ¦ which has pursued , produced and stockpiled a large number of atomic bombs in violation of international laws and away from the eyes of international inspectors.â€
� Rouhani was referring to the fact that Israel , unlike Iran , has not signed the treaty on non - proliferation of nuclear weapons .
Iranâ€ ™ s parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , also condemned Netanyahuâ€ ™ s speech as a â€œfoul spectacleâ€ � intended to spread fear , and â€œa disgraceâ€ � for Israel .
He dismissed the Israeli leaderâ€ ™ s claims as repetitive and ridiculous and said they exposed the declining influence of his country in the Middle East .
â€œThe person who is expressing such worries about Iran in fact has his hands on more than 200 nuclear warheads , â€ �
Larijani told Iranian lawmakers on Wednesday , according to the semi - official Fars news agency .
â€œDoesnâ€ ™ t it show the disgrace of the worldâ€ ™
s
bullying power?â€ � Larijani also denied Netanyahuâ€ ™ s claim that Iran is seeking to build an empire in the region .
In Tuesdayâ€ ™ s speech , Netanyahu compared Iran to Islamic State ( Isis ) and said both were competing for the â€œcrown of militant Islamâ€ � .
He had told American lawmakers : â€œBoth want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world .
They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire.â€ �
Larijani responded by saying : â€œWe are not and have never been seeking to build an empire , but our Islamic revolutionary values against the big powersâ€ ™ imperialism and the cruel Israel have appealed to the hearts of Muslims.â€ � Netanyahuâ€ ™ s speech also featured in Wednesdayâ€ ™ s papers in Tehran .
Kayhan , an ultra - conservative daily , described it as hollow in a front - page article and the reformist Etemaad said it was merely a â€œclown showâ€ � .
Iranâ€ ™ s ambassador to the UN , Gholamali Khoshroo , responded to the speech by writing an article for the New York Times , in which he said Netanyahu had a â€œcampaign of misinformationâ€ � aimed at misleading the public about the details of current nuclear negotiations between Iran and the worldâ€ ™ s major powers .
He wrote : â€œThe paradox of the situation is that a government that has built a stockpile of nuclear weapons , rejected calls to establish a nuclear - weapons - free zone in the Middle East , made military incursions into neighbouring states and flouted international law by keeping the lands of other nations under occupation , now makes such a big fuss over a country , Iran , that has not invaded another country since America became a sovereign nation.â€ �
Other Iranian politicians also rebuked the Israeli prime ministerâ€ ™ s speech .
Hossein Naghavi - Hosseini , an Iranian MP who sits on the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy , echoed Larijani in condemning the address .
â€œNetanyahuâ€ ™ s speech about Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme is an insult to all countries involved in the current negotiations , â€ � he said , according to the semi - official Isna news agency .
Pirouz Mojtahedzadeh , an Iranian analyst , said the speech was â€œan insult to the political independence of Americaâ€ � .
According to Isna , he said : â€œIt was clear from Netanyahuâ€ ™ s speech that he is frightened by the prospects of an accord between Iran and the United States.â€ � Shortly after Netanyahuâ€ ™ s speech ,
Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister reacted by dismissing it as â€œboring and repetitiveâ€ � and an anti - Iranian tirade aimed at influencing the upcoming elections in Israel .
â€œNetanyahuâ€ ™ s lie - spreading campaign against Iranâ€ ™ s peaceful nuclear programme has become boring and repetitive , â€ � said the foreign ministry spokeswoman , Marzieh Afkham .
â€œThe speech by the Zionist regimeâ€ ™ s prime minister was a piece of deceitful theatre which is part of the hardlinersâ€ ™ election campaign in Tel Aviv ,
â€ � she was quoted as saying by the state news agencies .
The Twitter account of Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , which is run by his office , also reacted to the speech by posting a number of tweets condemning Israel and its treatment of Palestinians ."
2015-03-18,"Jason Rezaian , the Washington Post reporter detained in Iran for nearly eight months , is the victim of internal rivalries between powerful senior figures in the Islamic republic , with hardliners accusing him of gaining privileged access to information through the nephew of the countryâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani .
The Iranian intelligence authorities have been trying to build a case against Rezaian in an effort to undermine Rouhaniâ€ ™ s moderate administration , which favours better relations with the west , the Guardian has learned .
Hardliners have claimed that the Iranian - American reporter had access to sensitive information through contacts with Rouhaniâ€ ™ s nephew , Esmail Samavi , who works for the presidentâ€ ™ s office as a public relations manager .
Rezaianâ€ ™ s family say the allegations are unfounded .
â€œIf
they [ the Iranian intelligence authorities ] are trying to go after the Rouhani family , then theyâ€ ™ ve held the wrong person for eight months , â€ � said Jasonâ€ ™ s brother , Ali , the family spokesman .
Ali said his brother did not have a relationship â€ “ personal or professional â€ “ with a member of the presidentâ€ ™ s family .
â€œJason has never had any direct communication with anyone in the Rouhani family , â€ �
he said .
â€œHe wasnâ€ ™ t friends with anyone in the Rouhani family .
He wasnâ€ ™ t associates with anyone in the family .
He wasnâ€ ™ t even in contact with anyone in the family.â€ �
Rezaian was detained in July 2014 after security forces raided his home in Tehran and arrested him , his wife , Yeganeh Salehi , also a journalist , and two friends , an Iranian - American couple with close ties to Rouhaniâ€ ™ s family .
After those arrests , opposition sources reported that security officials had also sought to arrest Samavi in connection with Rezaianâ€ ™ s case but did not succeed because of his high - profile role in the presidential office .
The Iranian - American couple were released shortly after their arrest , and Salehi was released on bail in October , but Rezaian has been held ever since .
Several sources , speaking to the Guardian , confirmed Rezaian has become caught up in the high - level feud between Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government and its internal opponents .
Rezaian , has been kept incommunicado for the most of his time in jail with little access to his lawyers and family .
He was finally charged in December , but the exact nature of the changes has still not been made public .
Last month , Hamid Rasaei , an influential hardline MP said in a statement published on his website that Rezaian had been accused of espionage , and told reporters in Tehran that Rezaian had made a full confession on camera .
â€œUnder the cover of their work as reporters , Jason Rezaian and his wife infiltrated some of the most sensitive places at the presidentâ€ ™ s office , â€ �
Rasaei wrote .
â€œWhich individual helped Jason Rezaian bypass security barriers and gain access to materials for espionage?â€ � the parliamentarian asked before hinting that he was referring to Samavi , whom he referred to only by his initials .
â€œWho is preventing ES , who is a manager in the presidentâ€ ™ s office , from being called in for questioning?â€ �
Omid Memarian , an Iranian journalist based in New York and a friend of the Washington Post reporter , said Rezaian had never met Samavi .
He said the Rezaian was permitted to attend a press conference at the presidentâ€ ™ s office just once during his eight years reporting in Iran , and he wasnâ€ ™ t allowed to ask any questions .
Rezaian was also permitted to accompany Rouhani during a provincial visit last year , but Memarian said he was not on the presidentâ€ ™ s plane and did not have privileged access .
â€œIt is quite clear from Rasaeiâ€ ™ s remarks that the reasons for the arrest , the interrogations , and the forced confessions were all centred around building a case against Hassan Rouhaniâ€ ™ s nephew , â€ �
Memarian told the Guardian .
â€œJason is a victim of the competition between different Iranian intelligence organisations , and a fabricated case against the presidentâ€ ™ s nephew .
But Hassan Rouhani has preferred to maintain complete silence in this regard.â€ �
Memarian added : â€œI believe it is shameful that almost everyone inside Iranâ€ ™ s foreign ministry and the presidentâ€ ™ s
office knows that Jasonâ€ ™ s arrest was made to make a case against Rouhaniâ€ ™ s nephew , and they have still kept silent during all this time.â€ �
In 2003 , Memarian was himself put in prison in Iran and coerced into making a false confession , a familiar tactic used against those held on political grounds .
â€œWeeks of solitary confinement and psychological and physical torture eventually made me give in to demands of those who had arrested me , â€ �
he said .
â€œIn a similar position , after months of brutal solitary confinement , Jason is forced to give in to the demands of those who arrested him and confessing to things that anyone who knows him at all knows to be fabricated crimes.â€
�
Rezaianâ€ ™ s
detention is complicated by the fact that Iran does not recognise dual citizenship , and treats him solely as an Iranian .
As a result , Rezaian has not had consular access through the Swiss embassy , which acts on behalf of American citizens in Iran because the US does not have diplomatic relations with the country .
Iranian intelligence authorities are deeply suspicious of dual citizens and have arrested a number of them in recent years on accusations of spying for foreign countries .
Rouhani is loathed by hardliners because of his efforts to create greater social freedoms at home and engage with the international community .
They believe his administration is giving away too much for too little in the current nuclear negotiations .
Hardliners also accuse Rouhani of nepotism .
The presidentâ€ ™ s
brother , Hossein Fereydoun , also works for him as his special adviser and is currently involved in the nuclear talks with the worldâ€ ™ s major powers .
Iranâ€ ™ s judiciary , which is dominated by conservatives , acts independently of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government , meaning that the presidentâ€ ™
s influence on such cases in limited .
But Rouhani can still use his position as the public face of the Islamic republic to defend Rezaian , which he has refrained from doing , at least so far .
Rezaianâ€ ™ s family and the Washington Post have recently stepped up their calls for his release , expressing deep concern that Rezaianâ€ ™ s case is now being reviewed by a hardline judge , Abolghassem Salavati , who has a record of handing down heavy sentences on similar cases .
At a press conference last week , Ali Rezaian said he appealed to the government in Tehran to release his brother on bail for , Nowruz , the Persian new year , which begins on 21 March .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a time for new beginnings , â€ � Ali said , speaking at a press conference in Washington .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a time for generosity and mercy.â€ �"
2015-03-22,"Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani make an unlikely double act .
But as negotiators from the US and Iran race towards the 31 March finishing line for a nuclear deal , this odd coupleâ€ ™ s
destinies have become inextricably linked .
The long - running saga of Iranâ€ ™ s standoff with the west has become a tale of two presidents .
It is plain that Barack Obama is rooting for a positive result in Lausanne next week when negotiators make a final attempt to reach a comprehensive agreement on Iranâ€ ™ s suspect nuclear programme .
Attempts to thwart him by opponents , at home and abroad , only seem to have increased the presidentâ€ ™ s determination .
Obama does not want a nuclear deal alone .
He wants to bring Iran in from the cold , bridging the rift begun after the 1979 Islamic revolution and the ensuing US embassy hostage siege in Tehran that all but destroyed Jimmy Carterâ€ ™ s presidency .
If he succeeds , his achievement could dwarf the recent rapprochement with Cuba that ended an even longer period of estrangement .
Although the idea is publicly played down for pragmatic reasons , Obama senses a rare strategic opportunity â€ “ a sort of grand bargain â€ “ that could eventually transform American and western fortunes , and increase US leverage in the Middle East after more than a decade of foreign policy disasters and setbacks in Iraq , Syria , Palestine , Egypt and Libya .
In this White House view , mutually beneficial cooperation in tackling shared challenges , such as the spread of Sunni extremism , the rise of the Islamic State ( Isis ) terrorism and Syriaâ€ ™ s civil war , would be a natural progression following a nuclear deal .
To this end , Obama has already been in direct contact with Iranâ€ ™ s leadership .
A historic agreement with Iran would be the centrepiece of what Obama hopes will be an impressive presidential legacy , as he approaches the end of his second , final term in office .
Critics say he needs it , for he has not much else to show for nearly eight years at the helm .
Obamaâ€ ™ s televised Nowruz address to mark the Iranian new year last week was aimed specifically at the Iranian public and included greetings in Farsi .
His ambition was evident and his appearance and delivery , while slightly uncomfortable , seemed genuine enough .
â€œMy message to you
â€ “
the people of Iran â€ “ is that , together , we have to speak up for the future we seek .
This year , we have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries , â€ � Obama said .
â€œThe days and weeks ahead will be critical .
Our negotiations have made progress , but gaps remain .
And there are people , in both our countries and beyond , who oppose a diplomatic resolution.â€
�
Demonstrating just how difficult it will be to build trust , this last , seemingly innocuous statement drew a rebuke from Iranâ€ ™ s ever - sceptical , anti - western supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
No one in Iran opposed a diplomatic solution , he claimed on Saturday .
What they opposed was American bullying .
Pointing to divisions in Washington over the terms of a deal , Khamenei said Obamaâ€ ™ s Nowruz message â€œincluded dishonest assertions ... his claim of friendship for Iranian people was not sincereâ€ � .
Obamaâ€ ™ s promises on lifting sanctions were not to be believed , he suggested .
Hardliners opposed on ideological and security grounds to detente are a problem both presidents share .
Khameneiâ€ ™ s scepticism , and the rejectionistsâ€ ™ case , has been strengthened , for example , by the unauthorised letter recently sent to the Tehran leadership by 47 US Republican senators .
They warned they would try to exercise a de facto veto over any deal Obama might sign .
Khamenei aside , Rouhani is under constant pressure from powerful Shia fundamentalists , political conservatives and their allies in the media , who represent entrenched clerical , military and mercantile interests .
These groups accuse Rouhani , implicitly or otherwise , of selling out to the west .
They deplore his centrist , reformist political stance as dangerously radical , although in truth Rouhani , like Obama , is very much an establishment figure .
And while Obama is on his way out , Rouhaniâ€ ™ s foes will do all they can to prevent the Iranian president winning a second term in 2017 , should he choose to stand for re - election .
Prominent among such hostile forces are the Revolutionary Guards and its elite al - Quds force , led by the increasingly influential General Qassem Suleimani .
He is lionised in Iran for advancing the countryâ€ ™ s interests in Lebanon and Iraq , where he has recently overseen the battle with Isis around Tikrit .
There is talk that Suleimani may seek the presidency as the conservativesâ€ ™ standard - bearer .
Ironically , leading players in Iran such as Khamenei , Suleimani and the veteran cleric and Friday prayer - leader , Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati , now find themselves in a de facto alliance with American neo - cons and Israelâ€ ™ s hawkish prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , who publicly conspired with Obamaâ€ ™ s Republican opponents this month to trash a â€œbad dealâ€ � .
Likewise , both Obama and Rouhani are under fire from Saudi Arabia and the conservative Gulf monarchies :
Rouhani because , for historical reasons , Riyadh opposes anything that advances Persian interests , Obama because the Saudis believe he is naive and that Iran would renege on any deal , thus sparking a Middle East nuclear arms race .
Most of all , however , Iranâ€ ™ s
conservatives fear Rouhani because success in Lausanne next week could potentially break the sanctions chokehold on Iranâ€ ™ s oil exports , financial services and foreign investment .
Iran officially denies it , but Guardian interviews conducted in Tehran last year showed how hard sanctions are hurting the person in the street .
An agreement that improved ordinary Iraniansâ€ ™ economic fortunes by restoring normal trading ties and progressively opening the country to greater contact and exchanges with Europe and the US would be a triumph for Iranâ€ ™ s president .
A deal could transform Rouhaniâ€ ™ s so - far lacklustre presidency , giving it historic importance .
It could do the same for Obama .
And they both know it ."
2015-03-27,"David Cameron and the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , have agreed that international negotiators in Switzerland have a â€œhistoric opportunityâ€ � in the next few days to put together a framework deal to resolve a long - running and dangerous standoff over Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
Cameron and Rouhani met at the UN last September , but this was their first significant conversation since then and their first phone call .
Downing Street said it was made on the initiative of the Iranian president and lasted half an hour early on Thursday afternoon .
â€œIt was a substantive discussion and was pretty cordial , â€ � a Downing Street spokeswoman said .
It dwelt mostly on the multilateral nuclear talks under way in Lausanne in the runup to an end - of - March deadline for producing a framework understanding on what a final deal would look like .
Diplomats would then have until the end of June to complete the fine print on the agreement .
The prime minister urged Rouhani â€œto seize the opportunity offered by the talks and not underestimate the concerns of the international communityâ€ � in ensuring Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful , the spokeswoman said .
The conversation also covered the turmoil in Yemen and the bilateral relationship between the UK and Iran .
Cameron insisted he remained keen to reopen an embassy in Tehran , but several outstanding technical issues had to be resolved first .
According to a version of the conversation on the state - run Iranian news agency IRNA , Rouhani urged all states at the talks to â€œtake the unique chance of striking a dealâ€ � and â€œnot let the chance slip away easilyâ€ � .
IRNA said the Iranian president had â€œhighlighted the constructive role of the UK at the present juncture in carrying on with talks on equal basisâ€ � .
Rouhani also held phone conversations on Thursday with the leaders of France , Russia and China as the talks resumed in Lausanne after a five - day pause , under the leadership of the US secretary of state , John Kerry , and the Iranian foreign minister , Muhammad Javad Zarif .
The White House confirmed it had received a letter from Rouhani .
The Iranian president tweeted that he had also sent letters to the leaders of the other states represented at the talks â€ “ the UK , France , Germany , Russia and China â€
“ though it was unclear what the letters said .
â€œThese are tough negotiations involving complex technical judgments and difficult political choices .
We have made substantial progress in a number of areas but there are still important issues where no agreement has so far been possible , â€ � a senior British diplomat said .
â€œOur task for the next few days is to see whether we can bridge the gaps and arrive at a political framework which could then be turned into an agreement , and that will be a process that could quite a long time because of the complexity of the subject matter.â€ �
If diplomats get close to a deal , the foreign ministers from all the negotiating nations are due to fly out to join Kerry and Zarif in Lausanne , possibly this weekend .
Among the outstanding issues are the timing of the lifting of sanctions on Iran , the countryâ€ ™ s right to carry out research and development on centrifuge technology for uranium enrichment , and the future use of an underground enrichment plant at Fordow .
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that a compromise was being considered concerning Fordow , which western powers insist can not be used for uranium enrichment on any scale , in the face of Iranian objections .
In the compromise described by AP Iran would be allowed to spin a few hundred centrifuges in Fordow , not to refine uranium but other elements , such as zinc , xenon or germanium , for medical and scientific purposes .
Even if there is agreement on the substance of the negotiations , there is lingering discord over how the agreement should be presented .
The Iranians and Europeans would like it to disclose as little as possible in public , while Kerry â€ “ who has to present the results of the talks to Congress next week
â€ “ wants a list of specific agreed issues to be made public .
â€œWe will need to communicate as many specifics as possible to the public in some form or fashion .
What that will look like we truly just do not know at this point yet , â€ � said a senior US State Department official .
â€œObviously , weâ€ ™ ll be communicating that to Congress as well .
But I think what folks are focused on right now is the substance of what we are trying to work towards in a political framework , and as we get closer here , I think conversations about the form for some sort of public announcement will be a part of the discussion , but we truly do not know at this point.â€ �"
2015-04-03,"Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has said that his country will fulfil all its obligations under Thursdayâ€ ™ s historic nuclear agreement , which he hailed as the start of a â€œnew pageâ€ � of cooperation between Tehran and the international community .
Rouhani spoke live on the state television on Friday a day after diplomats in Switzerland agreed a framework deal that provides the basis for a more comprehensive nuclear agreement .
He said the Iranian nuclear programme will pose no threat to the world and told countries in the Middle East that Tehran wants better relations .
â€œToday is a day that will remain in the historical memory of the Iranian nation , â€ � the moderate cleric said as he thanked Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and the countryâ€ ™ s negotiating team , led by foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif , on the outcome which he said was â€œwin - winâ€ � for both sides .
Under the tentative agreement , restrictions will be placed on Iranâ€ ™ s enrichment of uranium so that it is unable to use the material in nuclear weapons .
In return , the US and EU will terminate all nuclear - related economic sanctions on Iran once the UN nuclear agency confirms that Iran has complied .
Rouhani devoted a great deal of his speech to the issue of sanctions as it effects ordinary lives in Iran .
â€œThis government had promised that centrifuges should spin , but so should peopleâ€ ™ s lives ... this aim is in reach now more than any other time in previous weeks and days , â€ �
he said .
â€œOn the day that the agreement comes to force , all economic , banking sanction and all resolutions against Iran will be lifted.â€
�
The Iranian president , who came to power on promises of ending the nuclear stalemate during his campaign , said today the world has admitted the countryâ€ ™ s nuclear programme is peaceful .
â€œI say very clearly that our enrichment [ programme ] and nuclear technology will only be for Iranâ€ ™ s progress and will not be used against any country , â€ � he said .
He promised that his country will not cheat if the other side also abides by its obligations under the agreement .
â€œThe world should know that we are not deceptive and are not liars and any promises we give will be within framework of our national interests and we will live up to our promises provided that the opposite side abides by its promises as well.â€ �
Rouhani said if nuclear talks lead to a comprehensive agreement , which is due by the end of June , it will provide basis for more cooperation with the world on other issues , especially as Iran has increasingly become involved in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq .
â€œFrom the day the agreement is implemented , there will be a new page in Iranâ€ ™ s cooperation with the world both on the nuclear issue and other issues , â€ � he said .
â€œWhen the nuclear issue reaches a conclusion , this will be a first step for constructive cooperation with the world .
We will extend our hands to anyone who would respect us and want to work with us according to mutual interests.â€ �
He added : â€œWe want better relations with the countries that we have had cold relations with , if there is tension between us and some countries , we want to end this animosity and end tensions.â€ �
Earlier on Friday , Zarif , who is the countryâ€ ™ s chief nuclear negotiator , returned to Tehran to a heroâ€ ™ s welcome as thousands of people greeted him at Tehran airport .
Iranians hope the deal will end years of international isolation and economic hardship â€ “ and avert the threat of war .
â€œZarif
, thank you , â€ �
people chanted while waving the Islamic republicâ€ ™ s green , white and red flag .
Others took out their cellphones to take pictures of a man who will become a national hero if a final agreement , due in June , is reached .
On Thursday night , jubilant Iranians took to the streets within hours of the news breaking in Lausanne .
Drivers in Tehran honked their car horns even after midnight as men and women waved flags and showed victory signs from open windows .
In an unprecedented move , Iranâ€ ™ s national TV also broadcast Obamaâ€ ™ s Thursday speech on the agreement live .
â€œEveryone is happy , â€ � an Iranian journalist based in Tehran told the Guardian .
â€œYou can see it in peopleâ€ ™ s faces .
This agreement is lifting up their heart.â€
�
The deal was announced as Iranians were celebrating the last day of the the Nowruz new year holiday .
On Saturday , when the exchange market opens , many experts predict that the countryâ€ ™ s currency , the rial , will benefit from the breakthrough almost immediately .
The leader of Friday prayers , Ayatollah Imami Kashani , who often reflects the political mood among the conservative faction of the Islamic republic , said : â€œThe Lausanne declaration was a success .
We should congratulate Zarif .
The world finally accepted that Iran should have a nuclear programme for peaceful and technological purposes.â€ �
Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who is yet to announce his views of the breakthrough , has strongly supported Rouhaniâ€ ™ s nuclear diplomacy in the past .
As a result of Khameneiâ€ ™ s backing , hardliners refrained from attacking Zarif during the talks .
Hossein Shariatmadari , however , the hardline editor of the Kayhan state newspaper , was quick to denounce the framework agreement .
â€œWe gave them a saddled horse and they gave back some broken reins , â€ � local media quoted him as saying .
A small group of Iranian MPs echoed Shariatmadari and said any agreement should be endorsed by the countryâ€ ™ s parliament , the majlis .
Seyed Hossein Naghavi , spokesman for the parliamentary committee on the national security and foreign policy , said : â€œWe will not recognise an agreement that would not lead to a complete lifting of all sanctions.â€ � Ismail Kowsari , another MP from the committee , also said that Iran had not achieved its goal of all sanctions being lifted .
Overall , however , the framework agreement has garnered a great deal of support within Iran .
â€œI feel very proud as an Iranian , â€ � Kazem Sadjadpour , a university professor , said on state TV on Thursday night .
â€œThis is a turning point in Iranâ€ ™ s history of diplomacy .
This is a night of mourning for [ Israelâ€ ™ s prime minister Binyamin ]
Netanyahu and his warmongering allies in the US congress.â€ �"
2015-04-04,"Nearly two years after Hassan Rouhani was elected Iranâ€ ™ s president and began the slow process of rebuilding trust with Washington , a nuclear deal was reached last week in Switzerland .
His nation promised to make drastic cuts to its nuclear programme in return for the gradual lifting of sanctions as part of a historic breakthrough in Lausanne that could end a 13-year nuclear standoff .
â€œToday is a day that will remain in the historical memory of the Iranian nation , â€ � the moderate cleric said shortly after the deal was announced , as he thanked Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , without whose approval he could never have stepped up engagement with the west .
Rouhani swept to a surprise landslide victory in Iranâ€ ™ s 2013 presidential elections as a candidate of curious contradictions â€ “ a cleric from the heart of the political establishment who carried the battered hopes of reformists .
A former nuclear negotiator who had preached and practised moderation and compromise , he promised Iranians that he would be the candidate to end their countryâ€ ™ s isolation , without also ending its peaceful nuclear programme .
It was an ambitious pledge that would be battered by the opposition of hardliners at home , in western capitals and Israel , and until last week no one was really sure if he could pull it off .
Rouhani was born to a modest family of farmers and carpet weavers in the hamlet of Sorkheh , where his father owned a spice shop and had links to clerics in the city of Qom , a centre of religious learning and authority for Shias .
A calm child and good student , he enjoyed reading the Qurâ€ ™ an but also nurtured a love for swimming and mountain hiking that friends say has endured to this day .
The president has described his family as â€œreligious and revolutionaryâ€ � ; they were also close - knit .
His brother , Hossein Fereydoun , serves as his special adviser and was at the heart of the Lausanne talks , and when their mother died after a long illness last month , negotiations were briefly suspended .
At around the age of 20 , he had an arranged marriage to his 14-year - old cousin , Sahebeh , who kept such a low profile for many years that when Rouhani was running his election campaign journalists did not even know her name .
He went on to a seminary in Qom , where he became a cleric and forged the ties that would underpin his life , career and even his name .
After his preaching attracted the attention of the shahâ€ ™ s feared secret police , the Savak , he changed it in a bid to escape capture .
Eventually he decided Iran was too dangerous , and fled to Paris , before returning in triumph after the revolution .
His credentials and intellect ensured a rapid rise and to the very heart of Iranâ€ ™ s government .
He was commander of national air defence during the war with Iraq in the 1980s , and in 1986 , as deputy speaker of parliament , took part in secret talks with the US over the arms - for - hostages deal that became known as the Iran - Contra affair .
In 1989 , the year Khomeini died , he was made secretary of the supreme national security council .
â€œHe is the ultimate insider , â€ �
a former Tehran - based diplomat said soon after his election .
â€œHe knows all Iranâ€ ™ s secrets.â€ � Despite , or perhaps because of , his impeccable revolutionary credentials , Rouhani has never seemed bound to any of its orthodoxies , including kneejerk anti - Americanism .
He caused a minor sensation in 2003 when he visited the scene of the devastating Bam earthquake and took the unusual step of thanking America for its help in a field hospital staffed by US medics .
Over a decade later , he called subtle attention to that early gesture of friendship by tweeting a picture of the visit , and calling for the healing of a â€œvery old woundâ€ � , the day after his first presidential election .
He chose to study for both his masters and doctorate in Glasgow , juggling the final stage of his education with his position as deputy speaker of the Iranian parliament , apparently with great humility .
â€œHe was on first ( name ) terms with fellow students , â€ �
Prof Hassan Amin , now retired from the law faculty at Glasgow Caledonian University , told the BBC .
â€œMany times he ate in the studentsâ€ ™ canteen and sometimes I would take him to the staff restaurant .
He chose Great Britain because he has respect for the legal system here , for the judiciary and also for the legislative system.â€ �
He also has a reputation for staying cool in even the most emotional political crisis , due in part to his response to the 1998 murder of several Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan .
The killings sparked a wave of public anger that other politicians tried to ride ; Rouhani was one of the rare regime voices to oppose a military response .
Part of the hope his election victory sparked among foreign governments , keen to end the standoff with Iran , was born of his previous role as a top nuclear negotiator .
The British and American diplomats he faced across the table respected him as an effective pragmatist .
â€œPeople donâ€ ™
t realise that heâ€
™ s the one who convinced Khamenei to stop the clandestine military nuclear programme at the end of 2003,â€
�
FranÃ§ois Nicoullaud , Franceâ€ ™ s ambassador to Iran at the time , told Time magazine when Rouhani was elected .
â€œThis makes me optimistic now because I believe that he is a man able to take such an important step.â€ �
He was sidelined by the election of populist hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005 , resigning to run a government thinktank , the Centre for Strategic Research , that became something of a haven for others out of favour with the government .
He was an outspoken critic of Ahmadinejad and his team for nearly a decade , domestically and abroad .
â€œA nuclear weaponised Iran destabilises the region , prompts a regional arms race , and wastes the scarce resources in the region , â€ � he wrote in a letter to Time magazine in 2006 .
â€œAn Iranian bomb will accord Iran no security dividends.â€
�
That opposition culminated in the presidential race , when he faced off against Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili .
He accused him of crippling the country and its economy with short - sighted dogmatism .
â€œIt is good to have centrifuges running , provided peopleâ€ ™ s lives and livelihoods are also running , â€ � he said in one TV debate .
â€œAll of our problems stem from this â€ “ that we didnâ€ ™ t make the utmost effort to prevent the nuclear dossier from going to the UN security council.â€
�
The pragmatic flexibility on means , without compromise on principles , appears to define much of his life and career ; it is even laid out in the introduction to his doctoral thesis .
â€œThis thesis verifies that no laws in Islam are immutable ,
â€ � the abstract explains .
â€œImmutability is only applicable to faith , values and ultimate goals in Shariah.â€ �
Indeed , his lifelong enthusiasm for defying conventional expectations in pursuit of his goals continued into office , where among other innovations he has embraced opportunities offered by Twitter to communicate with supporters â€ “ even though it is officially banned in Iran .
Last summer , he tweeted a picture of an Iranian mathematician who had won a prestigious medal , considered the Nobel prize for maths , without a headscarf .
â€œCongrats to # MaryamMirzakhani on becoming the first ever woman to win the # FieldsMedal , making us Iranians very proud , â€ �
Rouhani said , attaching two photos .
Women are legally obliged to cover their heads in Iran , which made the picture highly controversial ; one newspaper later photoshopped in a head covering .
He also shocked conservatives in a country where religious strictures have been written into law by suggesting that people should have more freedom to choose for themselves .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t take people to heaven by force and with a whip , â€ � he told a healthcare conference .
But his limited authority has also disappointed some who expected faster progress on promises of transformation on everything from political prisoners to relaxation of religious dress codes .
Several high - profile cases have been a reminder of the power hardliners still wield in
Iranâ€ ™ s complicated political system , where the office of president is just one centre of authority , and like all other factions must defer to the supreme leader .
The Washington Postâ€ ™ s correspondent in Tehran , Iranian - American Jason Rezaian , has been detained for nearly eight months , and little is known about the charges levelled against him .
His wife is also facing charges , though she has been released on bail .
The Lausanne deal , though , was a huge victory for Rouhani , and the nationwide celebrations that followed an endorsement of his chosen approach , cautious persistence .
If the final agreement can be sealed for June , that diplomatic achievement and the economic benefits it will bring may earn him room to focus his intellect and political skills on another target .
THE ROUHANI FILE Born Hassan Feridoun in 1948 , in Sorkheh .
He changed his name when he became a cleric .
He has an MPhil and PhD in law from Glasgow Caledonian University .
Best of times Surprise landslide win in the 2013 presidential election .

We shouldnâ€ ™ t interfere in peopleâ€ ™ s lives to such an extent , even out of compassion .
Let them choose their own path to heaven.â€ �
They say â€œHeâ€ ™ s best described as a man of the centre with excellent political links to all parts of the political spectrum in Iran , â€ � said Sir Richard Dalton , a former British ambassador to Iran , and associate fellow at Chatham House .
â€œHis maxim will be
more â€˜letâ€ ™ s go for what worksâ€ ™ , rather than to respond to a preconceived reform programme.â€ �"
2015-04-19,"Australia and Iran have agreed to share intelligence relating to Australians fighting with extremist groups in Iraq , Australiaâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Julie Bishop , has announced .
Bishop has been in Tehran for the first high - level talks between the countries in more than a decade .
She revealed the details of the cooperation after a meeting with Iranâ€ ™ s president Hassan Rouhani , describing it as an extraordinary deal that will have beneficial outcomes in the fight against global terrorism .
â€œDuring my discussions with the national leadership here it was agreed that we could share intelligence , particularly on the foreign terrorist fighters from Australia who are taking part in this conflict in Iraq , â€ �
Bishop said .
â€œIt was an informal arrangement whereby we would share intelligence that would give us information on the Australians who are taking part
and I believe that Iran has information that we would seek and they were very agreeable to share that information with us , â€ � she said .
But the foreign minister would not comment on whether there was a conflict of interest in sharing information with Iran which could ultimately be used to capture or kill Australian fighters .
â€ �
Iâ€ ™ m not going into those kind of details .
That is obviously a matter of deep intelligence operational issue , â€ � she said .
Bishop praised Tehranâ€ ™ s extensive intelligence network , particularly its military influence in Iraq .
â€œThey are in Iraq and places we are not .
They also have a very sophisticated intelligence network and thereâ€ ™ s a lot of information they have been gathering.â€
�
The leaders agreed that the challenge posed by Islamic State , was one of the most significant global threats at present .
Australia has been negotiating with Iran on an information - sharing arrangement for a number of months , but the diplomatic push intensified following Sydneyâ€ ™ s Lindt cafe siege in December , in which two hostages and the gunman , Man Haron Monis , were killed .
Bishop brushed aside concerns that the informal arrangement would strain relations with Israel and the United States .
Around 100 Australians are believed to be fighting for Isis or related groups in Iraq and Syria ."
2015-05-11,"When Hassan Rouhani won the Iranian presidential election in 2013 , he identified improved relations with the Saudis as a priority .
His earlier role negotiating a 1998 co - operation agreement , followed by a visit to Saudi Arabia by president Mohammad Khatami , encouraged many to believe this was possible .
Last Saturday , 9 May , as the Saudis continued air strikes in Yemen , Rouhani lambasted an “ inexperienced ” government in Riyadh that “ does n’t understand … regional and global political issues … and thinks that it can show its power through using bombs and [ so ] show it is influential in the region ” .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the supreme leader , has been even more outspoken .
In early April he accused the Saudis of “ genocide ” and on 6 May of “ immense crimes ” in “ killing innocent people ” .
Khamenei has also reiterated denials from Iranian officials that Tehran has supplied arms to the Houthis , the main targets of Saudi bombs .
For the house of Saud , King Salman has been far more outspoken in public criticism of Iran than his predecessor and brother , King Abdullah , who died in January .
At last week ’s summit of the six - state Gulf Co - operation Council ( GCC ) , Salman said “ foreign powers ” - a reference to Iran - were trying to “ impose their authority … and spread sectarian strife
” .
The supervision of the Yemen campaign by Mohammad bin Salam Al - Saud , Salman ’s 29-year - old son and his new defence minister and deputy crown prince , signals the arrival of a new , more brash generation in Riyadh .
Sunni Arab leaders in the Gulf – and much of the Arab media – are offering a narrative in which Iran is arming the Houthis as part of a plan to control the Arab world .
They argue this results in part from the US “ withdrawing ” from the region at it prepares a nuclear agreement with Tehran .
King Salman , the crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud , and the deputy crown prince have been widely portrayed in the Saudi media as a heavenly triumvirate under white , angelic wings .
Yemen is more earthly .
A battleground for decades , the poorest country in the Arab world had a GDP per capita in 2013 of $ 1473 .
But a local , tribal - based conflict became a regional and international crisis as Saudi Arabia unleashed air strikes on 25 March it said would restore president Abd Rabbuh Mansour Al Hadi , who had been ousted in February .
The Yemen struggle is sectarian in that the main force responsible for Hadi ’s demise , the political grouping known as Houthis , are mainly Zaidi Shia .
But the Saudis backed Zaidi rulers against a military rebellion in the 1960s , and have since the 1990s supported two Zaidi presidents , first Ali Abdullah Saleh and then Hadi .
Today ’s calamity ties into wider tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran , and between Sunni and Shia Muslims that have been stoked for political gain .
Saudi Arabia ’s concerns over Iranian influence can be traced to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , leader of Iran ’s 1979 Revolution , declaring kingship incompatible with Islam , but more recent Saudi alarm dates from the 2003 US - led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein ’s Sunni - led order in Iraq and led to a new Shia - led regime friendly to Tehran .
Tensions between Tehran and Riyadh have exacerbated with the four - year war in Syria , as Iran backs president Hafez al - Assad , from the minority Allawi sect , and the Saudis finance militant Sunni opposition groups .
The Saudis have also felt destabilised by the Arab spring , which toppled their ally Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and promoted notions of democracy round the region .
But the Saudi - led GCC intervention in Yemen is a far cry from sending 1,000 troops into Bahrain in 2011 to prop up the Khalifah dynasty by battering civilian protestors .
“
Operation Decisive Storm
” , now rebranded as “ Restoring Hope ” , reflects the growing military muscle of a kingdom that last year became the world ’s fourth largest defence spender .
Overall GCC arms spending was in 2012 already $ 98.5 , ten times Iran ’s at $ 10.6 billion , according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies .
Iran knows it can not win an arms race .
Rouhani has questioned the new weapons deals being announced by the GCC , including Qatar ’s $ 7.1 billion agreement with France for Rafale jets , and the UAE ’s negotiations with France for 60 Rafales worth up to $ 11 billion .
“
The world should not smile at the problem of our region , ” he said in a speech carried on Iranian television .
“
Some American or European nation should not be proud of selling more weapons to this or that country .
”
Hence Iran ’s reaction to events in Yemen has been mixed .
The Iranian media has reported civilian deaths from Saudi airstrikes – likely to be far higher than the 97 documented by Amnesty International – while the pilot of an Iranian cargo plane forced to turn back by Saudi fighters gave a graphic account on television of the Saudis threatening to shoot down his plane along with its cargo of medical supplies .
There were small demonstrations in Tehran after Friday prayers denouncing Riyadh as “ the capital nurturing radicalism and terrorism ” , but most politicians have been vague .
Former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohsen Rezaei , former Revolutionary Guards commander , have spoken of a plot involving the US ( and , said Rezaei , the Saudis ) to divide Yemen , Syria and Iraq .
Caution is also evident in what looks like a tacit agreement with the US not to let the Yemen conflict affect maritime trade or wreck the nuclear talks with world powers .
An Iranian convoy approaching Yemen in April turned back after contact with a US aircraft carrier , and US military escorts for American and British ships passing through the straits of Hormuz , introduced after Iran seized a US - owned , Marshall islands - flagged cargo vessel off its coast on 28 April in pursuit of a legal action , were withdrawn on 6 May before the seized cargo ship released the following day .
Iran ’s leaders sense a new unpredictability in Saudi behaviour , but for now they can await developments .
While Hossein Amir Abdollahian , a deputy foreign minister , said on 2 May that “ military adventures ” of others would not be allowed to jeopardise Iran ’s
“
shared security
” , any Iranian interest in Yemen is slight , especially compared to Iraq or Syria .
Hence Iran ’s leaders will continue to stress the civilian deaths from Saudi airstrikes , drawing parallels with Israeli attacks on Gaza and trying to darken the Saudis’ name .
Human Rights Watch has accused the Saudis of using cluster bombs , a US - supplied munition also used by the Israelis , although Riyadh ’s military spokesman has issued a denial .
There is another reason Iran can wait .
Aerial bombardment has not removed the Houthis from many strategic points , including the port city of Aden , and Hodeidah and Sanaa airports .
No doubt , some in the Iranian leadership and military command relish the prospect of Saudi Arabia committing its inexperienced army against battle - hardened Houthi fighters on their own terrain .
A considerable proportion of the Saudi army is also of Yemeni origin .
Iran shares a wider scepticism about the Saudi troops .
Despite the bravado of its young defence minister , Riyadh is reluctant to fight on the ground , with the 150,000 soldiers massed on the border probably intended primarily to deter Houthi retaliation against air strikes .
Riyadh has persuaded Senegal to commit 2,100 troops , but Pakistan , Sudan and Egypt – no doubt at financial cost – have all declined Saudi invitations to send their soldiers into harm ’s way .
Iran can fine tune its own military supplies .
Little evidence has been produced these have been significant in a already country awash with weapons , despite a recent UN report highlighted Iranian arms supplies to the Houthis since 2009 .
But Iran may have increased its role since the Saudi intervention .
“
There have been credible reports of IRI recently providing training and equipment , ” said James Spencer , an independent security consultant .
“
These are most likely spare parts and specialist training for the Scuds [ ground - fired missiles ] which the Houthis had captured .
The Houthis would have no training , experience , or their own stocks or spares of these weapons .
[ But ] I have no record of a launch of a Scud in Yemen since 1994 , and the Scuds and their TELs [ mobile launchers ] were an early target of the Saudis .
”
The ceasefire called by the Saudis – and accepted by the Houthis – to begin tomorrow reflects the intervention by John Kerry , US secretary of state .
Washington fears not just the dangers of escalation for the wider Persian Gulf but concern that further violence in Yemen will facilitate the growth of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
But whatever happens at Camp David , at this week ’s US - GCC summit , the Saudis face a choice of escalation through committing troops or facing up to the breakdown of their military intervention .
Talks involving the various Yemeni factions could offer a face saver , but their success will depend on the willingness of all involved to put down their arms and the early return of Hadi as president is unlikely .
In any eventuality , Tehran will argue the Saudis have failed , but whatever those waving placards in Tehran may say , a defeat for Saudi Arabia is not necessarily a victory for Iran .
Tensions between the two regional powers are entering a new , volatile period ."
2015-05-27,"President Hassan Rouhani , who came to office in 2013 partly on the votes of young , middle - class women , knows that in the summer , hundreds or even thousands will be arrested by the morality police for “ bad hijab ” , a slack interpretation of the official dress code requiring women to cover their hair and figure even as temperatures push 40 degrees .
In his remark last year that “ you ca n’t send people to heaven by the whip ” , the president expressed a belief that citizens should not be forced into “ good ” behaviour , and in two recent speeches he skirted the issue of hijab , provoking a critical response from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the supreme leader , and from senior members of the clergy .
In late April , the president told an assembly of Iranian police officers the duty of the police was solely to enforce the law .
“
The police ’s job is not to enforce Islam , and furthermore , none among them can claim that their actions are sanctioned by God or the prophet [ Mohammad ] .
”
Although Rouhani stopped short of mentioning the harassment of women with bad hijab , he made a break from the period of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when then police commander Morteza Ahmadi Moghaddam stressed that the “ philosophy at the heart of the Islamic republic was the presence of religion in society
” and so “ the police must act to ensure that this goal is met ” .
Rouhani ’s offered a different vision : “ Many religious issues are merely matters of individual faith , ” he said .
“
Police come into the picture only when an actual law … clearly and explicitly applies .
For example , during mid - day prayers , could the police enter a bank and tell the employees that they must halt all business to pray ?
”
Rouhani ’s comments made a splash the next day on the front pages of many reformist papers , including Shargh , Etemad , Mardom Salari and Arman .
But it was n’t long before he received a response .
Khamenei appeared just a day later before an assembly of police commanders , making it clear that enforcing Islam was the police ’s first priority : “ All work can be done in the name of God , but in your work it is most easy to see how God ’s will can be done .
That is because your duty is to serve the society of the Islamic republic .
”
A member of the editorial board at Etemad told Tehran Bureau the leader had several motives in replying to Rouhani .
“
Firstly , he wanted to demonstrate his dominance over domestic affairs .
Secondly , he wanted to show that in his view , Islam supersedes the law .
And finally , he wanted to offer a kind of rebuke to Rouhani for getting out of line .
”
One analyst saw a connection with April ’s interim nuclear agreement with world powers at Lausanne .
“
This disappointed many of Khamenei ’s most ardent supporters , and they imagined that his leniency toward the west might translate to leniency in the domestic arena , which would allow Rouhani to take up reform with little resistance , ” she said .
“
Khamenei ’s immediate response is part of his efforts to assuage his anxious supporters and remind them that flexibility toward the western powers does n’t necessarily mean moderation in domestic policies .
”
But Khamenei ’s intervention also opened the door for others to enter the fray .
Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi , a senior Shia cleric , told another group of police commanders that
Rouhani ’s
remarks not only weakened “ the morale of the police ” but gave “ the green light for corrupt elements to introduce all manner of filth into society without any repercussion or response from the police ” .
Ayatollah Nouri Hamedani pointed out that Iran ’s constitution came “ straight from Islamic criteria ” and that the idea the police should not enforce Islam precluded the concept of “ enjoining the good and forbidding the evil ” in society , a notion found in the Qur’an .
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi , chairman of the Assembly of Experts , the clerical body that chooses the supreme leader , threatened the president with serious consequences : “ The executive branch can not deny Islam ; it must uphold it .
If it denies Islam , Islam will deny it in turn .
”
Mohsen Kadivar , visiting professor in Islamic philosophy at Duke university , North Carolina , and an influential reformist thinker of the 1990s and 2000s , said that Rouhani had expressed basic principles that were fundamental to all modern states .
“
Managing the nation on the basis of law is the cornerstone of the contemporary nation - state system , so to negate that in any way is to invite chaos , ” he said .
“
The announcement by the supreme leader and a few other marjas [ leading clerics ] that the police and everyone else should uphold Islam is a denial of the fundamentals of law , an agent of disorder , and a rejection of the rule of law .
”
Kadivar said the arguments of those criticising Rouhani were incompatible with the “ multiple interpretation ” of sacred texts in all religions .
“
For example , different jurists and muftis will put forth various , sometimes conflicting fatwas .
On which fatwa should the police or any other agents of the state rely when enforcing Islam ?
”
Neither did the problems end there .
“
If judges and police forego the law and act on fatwas , we will find ourselves back to the days of 100 years ago , when Iranians went to the streets to demand a constitution .
According to the constitution of the Islamic republic , the law is decided upon solely by the parliament .
The Guardian Council [ a constitutional watchdog ] , whose members are [ partly ] selected by the supreme leader , is tasked with making sure laws passed in parliament conform to the decrees of Islam .
Therefore , laws in the Islamic republic are passed under the supervision of appointees of the supreme leader , so there is no conflict with the supposed need to uphold Islam .
”
Despite all criticism he faced , Rouhani returned to the issue of bad hijab and law enforcement in a speech on 4 May before a group of teachers , in which he said that “ Colt- and handcuff - toting agents of the regime ” should not be expected to “ act as religious scholars .
”
In the Tandis luxury shopping centre , north Tehran , a young woman named Maryam told Tehran Bureau that Rouhani ’s campaign was important to her .
“
Sir , madam , what right do you have to say whether my hijab is proper or improper ? ?
Can you show me the hijab - o - meter they issued you when you took this job ?
Where in the Islamic texts does it say that in 21st century Tajrish [ quarter of north Tehran ] there ’s a girl with bad hijab whose offences to Islam must be stopped ?
“
Rouhani must do the right thing and stand by his word .
He has to stick up for our rights and not allow these brutes with guns and badges to insult us and have their way with us .
Most of them have n’t even finished tenth grade ?
Where do they come off insulting and arresting someone with a master ’s degree in front of everyone ?
”
At this month ’s recent Tehran International Book Fair ,
vans of morality police flanked the entrance to the book fair as had been promised by police spokesman Montazer Almahdi at a press conference .
“
Essentially the morality patrols are for protecting the dignity of men and women and act as a kind of hijab for the society of the Islamic Republic , ” he insisted .
Mahtab , a woman at the fair in conservative attire , said the situation was ridiculous .
“
I ’m a religious person myself - I prefer to wear the hijab - but who said you have to force everyone else to wear it ?
Some people do n’t want to wear it .
What does it have to do with you ?
Why do n’t they respect the law ?
Who said it ’s their duty to force everyone into heaven ?
”
The conflict over whether or not people should be dragged into heaven is set to continue .
“
Rouhani is testing the limits of his power to forbid the police from visiting violence upon our people , ” a member of the banned reformist party Participation Front told Tehran Bureau .
“
Restricting morality patrols is the beginning of Rouhani ’s project for gradually extracting Islamic ideology from the practice of law .
Just what he is willing to sacrifice for this project remains to be seen .
”"
2015-06-04,"As the Hassan Rouhani government woos western capitals in anticipation of a nuclear deal and the end of sanctions , foreign investors eying opportunities in Iran would do well to remember the lessons from the economies of the crumbled Soviet Union circa 1991 or gaizhi - era China over a decade later : strengthen your legal team , treat trust like a commodity , and beware of cephalopods .
Since the administration of economically pragmatic President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , Iranian governments have attempted to sell large portions of the mostly state - owned economy to “ the real private sector .
”
But after trying out a range of ideological strategies and transferring large volumes of capital , over 80 % of it ended up in the tentacles of organizations linked to the regime : banks , military enterprises , religious foundations , pension funds and populism - driven welfare projects , according to Princeton University scholar Kevan Harris .
Far from entering a green field of opportunities , as some members of the Rouhani administration would have them believe , foreign investors will have to reckon with around 120 pseudo - private entities that by the estimates of former deputy industry minister Mohsen Safai Farahani account for half the country ’s gross domestic product .
“
The quasi - governmental players are powerful and like octopuses over the Iranian economy , ” says Marvin Zonas from the University of Chicago
’s Booth School of Business .
“
Nonetheless , major foreign firms will work out relations with many of them which are eager for greater efficiencies …
But the underlying culture is not likely to change anytime soon .
Nor is the country ’s closed political structure .
”
Still , Iran is home to dozens of foreign firms that have tackled the intricacies of the local business environment .
Following the suit of manufacturers and engineering firms from Turkey and China , whose governments never fully implemented the sanctions regime , South Korea ’s Samsung and a several European automakers restarted their activities in Iran , taking advantage of sector - specific exemptions announced by the United States after the start of the nuclear negotiations in 2013 .
Most international banks are unlikely to touch Iran - based transactions as long as the sanctions on the country ’s financial system remain in place , so companies like Chinese computer manufacturer Lenovo or French carmaker Renault rely on oil - for - product swaps and other types of barter .
While these measures help meet the immediate needs of a consumer market starved for foreign products , the involved firms are often slated by the Iranian press for cutting disadvantageous deals that hinder the country ’s long - term economic prospects .
Returning emigrants , who have been trickling back into Iran after the last presidential election , have also made exploratory investments , but many report struggling against a culture of corruption and distrust .
In an interview for an article on business culture in the Islamic republic , a veteran corporate lawyer in Iran told Tehran Bureau that breach - of - contract cases have mushroomed in recent years , raising the legal costs of business transactions .
Irregularities on the Tehran Stock Exchange ( TSE ) , populated mainly by large industrial holdings co - owned by pseudo - private entities , are also common .
Last month , 43 individuals bought up 18 million shares of Mobin Petrochemical Company on a single day of trading , causing share prices to rise by over 30 % .
A parliamentary committee later cancelled the transaction , which TSE managers said was caused by “ defects in stock trading software .
”
Andreas Schweitzer , CEO of the Swiss - Iranian consultancy Arjan Capital , says he employs a disproportionately large legal team to address the “ special circumstances ” of the Iranian business environment .
“
You have to look at Iran as a Chinese or Russian economy that is highly state - owned , ” he says .
“
You have to make a decision if you accept this .
If you do , you have to adjust yourself .
We do n’t believe that one should go to Iran with just a little bit of business , because the cost is too high .
” When the government controls most of the economy , “ You can not prevent that big buyouts are made to government entities .
One ca n’t blame the system as such - one can only privatise again , ” Schweitzer says .
“
I do n’t think the government is getting the best value for its assets .
If this is the goal , and if one wants to attract money from western investment banks , the process should be competitive .
”
Schweitzer ’s business activities in Iran began eight years ago , with a wind farm construction project in the country ’s northwest .
The renewable energy sector was exempt from sanctions and wind was a topic of national interest , allowing Schweizer and his partners to access subsidized loans .
Together with an Iranian co - investor based in Tabriz , they approached now - Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian , a former Revolutionary Guards intelligence unit head , and completed the four 200-page licenses required and environmental studies .
The company was compelled to pause the project amid the inflation and political uncertainty of the late Ahmadinejad era , but to Schweitzer , that all comes with the territory .
“
You have to adjust a bit to the geopolitical weather , ” he says .
To succeed in Iran , Schweitzer recommends raising capital locally and taking advantage of existing infrastructure and expertise .
Ideally , the only imports should be upper management and know - how , he says .
Now , Arjan Capital consults foreign firms interested in a range of sectors : construction , hospitality , energy and branded retail .
“
Like the Chinese , the Iranians love western brands , so we bring a few very serious companies ... with a long - term vision , ” Schweitzer adds .
“
No one comes to build just one hotel .
They are coming to stay because the cost of getting established is significant .
”
As in other transitioning economies , staffing poses a particular challenge for foreign firms .
After years of isolation from international trends , Iranian workers lack the skills to fill middle and upper management positions .
“
If you needed in Russia 20 years ago 16 interviews to fill one job , you ’re looking at double that in Iran , ” Schweitzer says .
Domestic politics are also likely to affect the role of western businessmen , who will likely have to collaborate with pseudo - private companies and various factions of Iran ’s rulings elite to get their projects off the ground .
“
I doubt things are going to open up for American companies any time soon , ” said an Iranian expat doing business there .
“ Europeans will partner up with companies linked to the Revolutionary Guards , the bonyads and social welfare organisations to snatch up a lot of the good deals , and the regime will silence hardline opponents of the nuclear deal by handing them the crumbs .
”
Schweitzer adds that Iran remains a managed economy , and investors should not overestimate the country ’s readiness to handle a foreign influx in people and products .
“
Even if there ’s a lot of enthusiasm and pressure built up , it ’s a wiser move to make this process organized over a few years , ” says Schweizer .
“
Otherwise , it will be a tsunami that could do more damage than good .

2015-06-12,"Iranâ€ ™ s judiciary has unleashed a wave of heavy jail sentences against artists and activists in what appears to be an attempt to send a warning to those who dare to express dissent .
As the countryâ€ ™ s moderate president , Hassan Rouhani , tries to improve relations with the west , the conservative - dominated judiciary , which acts independently of his government , is demonstrating the limits of his power internally .
Those targeted recently include film - maker , writer and TV producer Mostafa Azizi , who has been sentenced to eight years in prison , painter Atena Farghadani , sentenced to 12 years , and anti - death - penalty activist Atena Daemi , sentenced to 14 years .
All three have been found guilty of insulting Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , through their activities on social networking sites such as Facebook .
They have also been convicted of other vague charges , which are often used against activists held on political grounds , including â€œspreading propaganda against the ruling establishmentâ€ � .
Recent harsh sentences follow a familiar pattern in Iranâ€ ™ s judicial system whose independence and impartiality have been repeatedly questioned by human rights groups .
A number of judges , who are believed to be acting under the influence of the countryâ€ ™ s intelligence apparatus , are notorious for holding trials behind closed doors and without proper legal procedures .
One of the convicts , Azizi , a former employee of Iranâ€ ™ s state TV , was arrested in February after returning to Iran from Canada , his country of residence , to take care of his elderly , ailing father .
According to his son , Arash Azizi , the film - maker was on Monday given five years for â€œgathering and colluding against the national securityâ€ � , two years for insulting Khamenei and a further year for his activities online .
The head of the Iranian judiciary is appointed directly by Khamenei .
Azizi has lodged an appeal against his conviction .
â€œMy father had heard numerously from Rouhani that it is safe for expatriates to return home , â€ � Arash Azizi told the Guardian .
â€œHe was encouraged to go back and he was under impression that there is a new opportunity in Iran for people like him to work.â€ �
In jail , Azizi is held along with Somali pirates .
Farghadani , 29 , who was put on trial last month in connection with her activism such as meeting with the families of political prisoners as well as her art , has recently been given 12 years and nine months in jail .
One evidence used against her in court was a cartoon she drew and posted online that depicted a group of Iranian parliamentarians with faces of monkeys and donkeys .
Cartoonists across the globe have since launched a campaign # Draw4Atena , drawing cartoons in her solidarity .
Atena Daemi , who has campaigned against capital punishment in Iran by participating in peaceful protests , distributing anti - death - penalty pamphlets and being active on Facebook and Twitter , now has to serve at least seven out of her total 14 years in jail under Iranian law .
On Tuesday , Ahmed Shaheed , the UN special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in Iran , expressed concern about the heavy sentences and urged the Iranian authorities to reconsider the cases .
â€œI am deeply concerned by the prosecution of these individuals for what appears to be a legitimate exercise of internationally protected rights to expression and assembly , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œThe arrest , prosecution , and conviction of these authors , artists , and human rights advocates for violating vaguely worded national security laws demonstrates that the environment in Iran is still not yet conducive for addressing certain issues of concern raised by the international community , and still not yet amenable to the demands of thousands of Iranians that voted for a new approach during the 2013 presidential elections.â€ �
Although Rouhani can not directly interfere in judicial matters , he can use his position as the public face of the country to defend those jailed unjustly , which he has not done publicly so far .
Focused on resolving the nuclear issue , critics say Rouhani has overlooked ongoing , if not increasing , violations at home .
At least four other social and human rights activists have reportedly also been given recent harsh convictions , including Omid Alishenas , sentenced to 10 years and Asou Rostami , Saeed Hosseinzadeh , and Ali Nouri , each sentenced to seven years .
â€œThe extremely harsh prison sentences handed down to Mostafa Azizi , Atena Daemi and Atena Farghadani are another nail in the coffin of freedom of expression in Iran , where the cost of voicing peaceful dissent is escalating rapidly , â€ � said Raha Bahreini , Amnesty Internationalâ€ ™ s Iran researcher .
â€œPunishments are now even harsher than they were in the post-2009 election crackdown .
The situation is absurd but frightening .
The Iranian authorities are clearly trying to frighten individuals into complete silence and submission.â€ � Faraz Sanei of Human Rights Watch echoed Bahreini .
â€œThe absurdly harsh prison sentences handed down against these social media activists underscore the prominent role revolutionary courts play in violating the most basic rights of Iranians to express their views , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€
™ s shameful that instead of protecting citizens against abusive laws that criminalise their right to speak out , Iranâ€ ™ s judiciary is actively endorsing the stateâ€ ™ s unlawful targeting of peaceful activists.â€
�
The Islamic republicâ€ ™ s judiciary is using various tactics to stymie activists .
One that has been used in recent cases is charging individuals on multiple grounds , thus increasings their total jail sentence , whereas activists were previously given less years in jail for similar activities .
Another tactic used is barring them from leaving the country after they are released , imposing bans on them being able to find work or banishing them to remote areas in the country , away from their family .
In May , after serving his six - year jail term , respected journalist Ahmad Zeidabadi was sent into internal exile a day after his release .
He was banished to Gonabad , in northeastern Iran , which is 1,000 km away from Tehran .
Similarly , Nourali Tabandeh , a dervish from Gonabad , whose community has also been targeted by the authorities , is not allowed to live in his hometown ."
2015-06-15,"President Hassan Rouhani unofficially kicked off next February ’s parliamentary elections before a gathering of provincial governors on 26 May.
“
No political or sectarian belief should be discounted , for they are based in religion , science , and personal beliefs , and of course elections without competition are impossible , ” Rouhani said .
“
We have different ideas in our society , and all are free to express their ideas .
This is why we have various parties and persuasions .
”
Rouhani ’s
comments suggest he hopes to prepare the way for increased reformist participation in the majles ( parliament ) .
The president suggested he would resist attempts by far - right , fundamentalist elements to improperly leverage money , influence , or advertising in order to influence voters .
“
Hopefully no one will be told that so - and - so from the government , the Revolutionary Guards , the military , the media , the regional or local government , or the mosques , supports so - and - so as a candidate for the majles , ” he said .
“
Such talk constitutes poison for otherwise healthy elections .
All officials and people in positions of power are duty bound to serve the interests of the nation as a whole and not those of [ particular ] political parties or individuals .
”
Has this given any encouragement to the reformists ?
In an interview with Tehran Bureau , a member of the Islamic Iran Participation Front , a leading party suspended since 2009 , expressed cautious optimism .
“
He ’s certainly come out swinging , but he ’ll eventually tone down the intensity as time passes , ” she said .
“
He may be demanding today that these elections be on a par with those of Finland and the UK in terms of openness and freedom , but ultimately he ’ll have to temper his expectations to something resembling Turkey ’s elections .
If his strategy gets results , it ’ll be a step forward , since it should translate to more moderates and reformists and fewer fundamentalists in the majles .
”
Fundamentalists have held a majority in the 310-seat majles since 2004 , when they overturned a reformist majority , and changing this will not be easy .
The fundamentalists’ predominance goes back to an election when the Guardian Council , which vets candidates , disqualified around 4,000 reformist hopefuls , including 80 sitting members .
In 2004 , only 50 % of those eligible voted , compared with 66 % in 2000 .
Four years later , in 2008 , only 51 % of eligible voters participated after the Guardian Council disqualified around 2000 candidates and only 29 reformists won seats .
The turnout in Tehran was just 30 % .
By the time of the 2012 parliamentary election , the political situation had been transformed by the authorities’ response to the street protests after the disputed 2009 presidential election .
Iran ’s conservatives referred to the protests as the ‘ sedition’ and to protestors and their alleged supporters as ‘ seditionists’ – so justifying the continuing house arrest of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , presidential candidates in 2009 and leaders of the Green Movement , which emerged in the protests .
In the 2012 parliamentary elections there was a boycott by reformist parties , including the Islamic Iran Participation Front , the Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organisation , and Karroubi ’s National Trust Party .
The Executives of Construction Party , led by pragmatic conservative Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , also kept aloof .
The reformists then cried foul when the authorities announced a 64 % turnout .
“
Obviously there was foul play , ” the Islamic Iran Participation Front member alleged .
“
The Revolutionary Guards interfered by supporting certain candidates .
Considering that all the reformists boycotted the elections and a large percentage of the voters still had the 2009 elections on their minds , only a Revolutionary Guard intervention could explain such a high turn - out .
”
Several prominent individuals from more moderate conservative parties explicitly confirmed this .
Parliamentary deputy Ali Mottahari told the majles in May 2012 :
“
Despite its successes , one of the major failures of the ninth majles elections was the degree to which the Revolutionary Guards entered the political arena and offered active , open support to the candidates of their choice .
Many candidates , both those who won and those who lost , have confirmed this .
”
Mohammad - Reza Bahonar , a parliamentary deputy from Tehran and the first deputy speaker , made allegations of rigging to the reformist newspaper Etemad at the time .
“
In these elections , I was told I would be ranked fifth ( in Tehran ) , but when the results were tallied , I was 25th , ” he said .
For next February ’s election , the reformists’ fears centre on the possibility that they or even candidates close to Rouhani ’s government will be disqualified en masse .
A staff member at the politics desk of the moderate newspaper Ebtekar told Tehran Bureau : “
To an extent , Rouhani ’s decisive victory in [ the presidential election of ] 2013
restored the people ’s confidence in the electoral process : the rulers here seemed to have learned a lesson from 2009 , and they were n’t willing to take quite such a big risk again .
Of course it ’s possible that there were some small cases of fraud in smaller cities and rural areas , but there was no sign of the kind of mass , systematic fraud that occurred in 2009 and 2012 .
”
Concerns around mass disqualifications can be explained in part by recent statements by Ahmad Jannati , 88 , chairman of the Guardian Council since 1992 .
“
The leadership of the Guardian Council has not forgotten the ‘ sedition’ as it relates to those candidates who would participate in the elections , ” Jannati told the May gathering of municipal governors .
“
The sedition , which occurred after the 2009 elections , was soundly defeated , but its goal was nothing less than the overthrow of the government , and the supreme leader has said that sedition is our ‘ red line.’ ”
Jannati ’s comments suggest that conservative factions within the governing apparatus are set on continuing revenge against the reformists and the Green Movement , and therefore have no intention of opening up the political arena .
But there is clear , and unresolved , tension here with what Rouhani has said .
Many prominent reformist politicians , some of whom received prison sentences after the 2009 protests , have yet to comment .
Even Mohammad Khatami , the former president still seen by many as the leader of the reform movement , has not talked about the elections in any public appearances over recent months .
The chances that the reformists will submit a comprehensive list of candidates for the elections are slim .
But if reform - minded politicians hope to clear fundamentalists out of parliament and the government , they could support a list of moderate technocrats .
Some reformists adopted a similar strategy in the 2013 presidential election when Khatami decided against running and former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was disqualified .
They threw their support behind the moderate Rouhani to stop a fundamentalist candidate getting elected .
Such a strategy could have considerable support among voters .
In the small village of Lasjerd , 170 km east of Tehran , a 55-year - old melon farmer named Akbar , who once voted for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president , said he would support whoever Rafsanjani recommended in order to curb “
Hezbollahis ” , or fundamentalists .
“
They cut our bread and water , our medicine , and they filled their own pockets , ” he said .
“
They used these sanctions , which devastated the farmers , to further enrich themselves , and now that this [ Mohammad Javad ] Zarif [ the foreign minister leading talks with world powers ] is trying to get the sanctions lifted , these bastards are trying to sabotage it !
They ’re trying to stop the agreement , so I ’ll vote for whoever can keep them out of power .
”
Shaghayegh , a 26-year - old reformist and law student at Tehran ’s science and technology university , said she would vote against “ Frankensteins and Draculas ” in the parliament .
“
I would n’t mind voting in some sane people – as long as I know there wo n’t be any funny business .
”
Shaghayegh is not optimistic over wider political reform .
“
If a bunch of cowardly moderates take over ... all we can hope for ... is that they do n’t muck things up further .
They could at least let Rouhani and Zarif pursue their foreign policy , and maybe they could push some good proposals for the economy .
But first we have to get rid of the people who are in control now .
”
A similar argument came from a Tehran - based reformist journalist , who argued next February ’s elections were of the “ utmost importance ” given the wide powers of the majles , including over the selection of ministers .
“
In the event that many reformist candidates are not disqualified , there may be considerable room for a competition that decides who controls the majles , ” he said .
“ This would not necessarily translate into a democratic transformation of the legal sphere .
The biggest gains will probably be seen over the economic situation and corruption .
Although [ wider ] democracy is undoubtedly an urgent matter , the precarious political conditions simply do n’t allow it at present . ”"
2015-06-23,"While a majority of Iranians support a nuclear agreement with the US and the other P5 + 1 powers , high hopes for the immediate lifting of international sanctions may mitigate support for Hassan Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government ahead of next yearâ€ ™ s parliamentary election , a new public opinion poll indicates .
Based on a telephone poll of 1,009 Iranians conducted 12 - 28 May for the University of Marylandâ€ ™ s Center for International and Security Studies by IranPoll.com and University of Tehran , a majority of Iranians supports a nuclear deal requiring their country to limit its centrifuges and nuclear stockpile for a number of years .
They also accept more extensive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency in return for the P5 + 1 accepting Iran to enrich uranium , lift economic sanctions , and expand nuclear cooperation with Iran .
Some 57 % of respondents agree with the current framework while only 15 % were opposed and another 28 % were undecided , but that support is tempered by expectations of speedy sanctions relief and economic recovery .
Of those polled , 63 % of respondents believe the current understanding would lead the United States to lift all its sanctions on Iran , while 38 % believe the P5 + 1 has already agreed to lift the sanctions immediately .
At least 53 % say the nuclear deal would lower the unemployment rate and tangibly improve peopleâ€ ™ s standard of living in under a year .
During the last round of nuclear talks in Lausanne , at which all negotiating sides announced a framework agreement , United States and Iran officials issued contradicting statements indicating the two sides were still at odds over the scope and mechanisms of sanctions - lifting .
As Iranâ€ ™ s scheduled February 2016 parliamentary election draws near , any snags over this aspect of the agreement could dampen public support for President Hassan Rouhani at a critical moment in domestic politics .
Widespread support â€ “ but a threat of lethargy Poll results indicate that 50 % of Iranian voters would prefer the new Majles , or lower house , to comprise Rouhani supporters , while 24 % said they would prefer Rouhaniâ€ ™ s critics .
But responses to related questions about the current governmentâ€ ™ s policies indicate that the president stands to lose support for the nuclear negotiations the longer the sanctions lethargy drags on .
Some 81 % of polled Iranians said the Majles should have the right to kill the negotiations .
( Interestingly , Iranian MPs voluntarily curtailed their own right to do so in a 20 June vote . )
A majority - 51 % â€ “ also say Iran should not agree to a deal unless the United States agrees to remove all of its sanctions .
Also , while 53 % said they would re - elect Rouhani as president in 2017 , another 27 % of respondents to this question said they would vote for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the former president whom the domestic press has blamed for the nationâ€ ™ s economic mismanagement .
While most respondents gave Rouhani high marks for improving security and the countryâ€ ™ s economic prospects , 53 % said he was unsuccessful at reducing unemployment .
â€œOn security and foreign policy Rouhani has high approval .
Those who see Iranâ€ ™ s military power as an achievement have increased substantially â€ “ about four times during just few months , â€ � says Amir Farmanesh of IranPoll.com , who co - authored the study .
He adds that regional instability and the rise of the Islamic State west of Iranâ€ ™ s borders has contributed to this trend .
â€œNaturally what is happening all around Iran should have made some people value the stability Iran has and count its military power as an achievement.â€ �

2015-06-29,"When Iranian hardliners criticized the nuclear deal reached between Iran and the P5 + 1 group in Geneva in 2013 , President Hassan Rouhani met with university professors and urged them to support his diplomatic stance on the nuclear issue .
â€œWhy is the university silent?â€ � he chastised the academics who attended the meeting .
â€œÙ‹Ù‹Ù‹Why are the professors silent ?
What we need is Socrates - like courage !
What are we afraid of? ...
Why should only a small number of people talk ?
Why must there be a group of uneducated people doing all the talking while our university professors speak in private ?
Why donâ€ ™ t they step forward ?

My father had previously criticized Iranâ€ ™ s stance regarding its nuclear energy program
â€ “ a stance that has brought on severe international sanctions against the country and endangered Iranâ€ ™ s national security .
However , he has supported President Rouhaniâ€ ™ s diplomatic approach to resolving the nuclear problem with the P5 + 1 countries .
My father believes that an agreement would reduce the threat of war and lead to an easing of the harmful economic sanctions .
To that end , he wrote a comprehensive 120-page analysis of the nuclear situation titled â€œThe Geneva agreement.â€ �
It was sent to Iranian authorities and published on his website .
A summary of this document was published in one of Iranâ€ ™ s few remaining independent journals .
In this document and other articles he also restated his position that a sustainable future for the country would only be achieved through the release of political prisoners , free and fair elections and an improvement of the human rights situation in Iran .
Shortly after publishing his views about the interim agreement , he faced pressure from the Intelligence Ministry , Iranâ€ ™ s official security apparatus .
The pressure took the form of constant threats to his person and severe limitations on his activities .
In June 2014 our private residences in Tehran and Damavand were raided .
Both houses were searched and the private archives , papers , and laptops of all family members were confiscated .
My father was arrested and accused of â€œspreading propaganda against the regime.â€ �
He was released on heavy bail and banned from leaving the country .
His subsequent trial was held in secret and he was sentenced to a lengthy prison term .
In the last year , my father has written to President Rouhani and explained the pressures he has been facing due to his public support of the Geneva nuclear agreement .
He also answered President Rouhaniâ€ ™ s above - mentioned questions to academics : â€œDo you know why academics are silent and donâ€ ™ t step forward to publicly support the Geneva agreement , â€ � he wrote on 1 July 2014 .
â€œBecause a ministry under your management , the Intelligence Ministry , threatens and arrests your supporters.â€ �
Meanwhile , the Intelligence Ministry pressured the judiciary to reopen my fatherâ€ ™ s previous trial , the objective being to imprison him as soon as possible .
In the original case , my father had been arrested and held behind bars for six months in 2001 , for the most part in solitary confinement .
He and other Melli - Mazhabi activists were initially accused of â€œplotting to overthrow the ruling regime.â€ �
However during the trial this charge was changed to â€œspreading propaganda against the regime.â€ �
My father was sentenced to four years in prison which was never implemented as the Court of Appeals did not uphold the sentence .
According to the law , because more than 10 years had passed since the judgment , the sentence could no longer be revived and carried out against him .
Ultimately , on 25 May 2015 , my father was sentenced to six years in prison and received a two - year ban on political and journalistic activities .
He was also given a fine for possession of a satellite TV dish and receiver .
Apparently , the intelligence agents could not wait until the sentence had been taken up by the Appeals Court .
On 16 June my father was arrested in the street by agents of the Intelligence Ministry without an arrest warrant and was taken to the Evin prosecution center .
Judge Nasiripour at first refused to issue an arrest warrant against my father , but the security forces urged him to contact the prosecutor .
Eventually , after a few hours , on the direct orders of the prosecutor , they transferred my father to Evin where he started his hunger strike and refused to take his medication to protest his illegal arrest .
The hunger strike was discontinued after four days .
Today my father remains in Evin prison .
The cells are very crowded and , as there are not enough beds for all prisoners , newcomers sleep on the floor .
Health and hygiene conditions are dismal .
My father is 70 years old and has serious health issues including a heart condition , high blood pressure , thyroid and severe allergies .
With prison conditions being what they are , I am not sure I will see him again after this imprisonment .
As the deadline for a final nuclear deal approaches , I hope , like many others , that Iran and the world powers reach a long - term deal that can ensure the peace , safety , and security we all desire .
It is ironic however that pacifists in Iran are being imprisoned for daring to speak out in favor of peace .
I wonder who will trust President Rouhani next time he puts out a call for Iranian intellectuals and academics to rally behind him ."
2015-07-14,"Negotiating an international agreement to curb Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief has been a high - stakes preoccupation for leaders around the world .
The Guardian ranks the main winners and losers in one of the most significant diplomatic deals of modern times .
Winners Hassan Rouhani Iranâ€ ™ s president is by a long way the biggest winner to emerge from the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers .
Rouhani highlighted the way in which Iranâ€ ™ s right to develop peaceful nuclear energy has been recognised , as has its status in the region .
Ending Iranâ€ ™ s international isolation is a historic achievement that looks likely to win him a second term in 2017 .
But he faces resistance from suspicious hardliners who fear that even limited rapprochement with the US and the west will promote demands for domestic change that could undermine a regime dominated by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Barack Obama
The US presidentâ€ ™ s achievement has to be measured against the position of George Bush , who declared in 2002 that Iran was a member of an â€œaxis of evilâ€ � that included Saddam Husseinâ€ ™ s Iraq and North Korea .
â€œThis deal demonstrates that American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change , â€ � he said .
â€œLet us never negotiate out of fear .
But let us never fear to negotiate.â€ � Obama has vowed to veto opposition in Congress .
If all goes well , the agreement will likely be the centrepiece of his foreign policy legacy and vindicate what many considered to be the premature award of a Nobel peace prize .
Bashar al - Assad
The Syrian president quickly hailed the agreement as a â€œmajor turning
pointâ€
� in the history of Iran , the region and the world , calling it a â€œgreat victoryâ€ � .
Assad has received military and financial support from Iran since the uprising against him erupted in 2011 .
Tehranâ€ ™ s
enhanced regional position in the wake of the deal will strengthen its demands for recognition as a key player in the Middle East , including in any negotiations about the future of Syria .
Assadâ€ ™ s Syrian and Arab enemies , contemplating a war that has already left 210,000 dead and made millions of people homeless , are horrified by the nuclear deal â€ “ for exactly these reasons .
Opposition activists branded the agreement # Munich2Vienna .
Vladimir Putin
The Russian president said the world had â€œbreathed a huge sigh of reliefâ€ � when the deal was finalised .
The lifting of sanctions against Iran could make the easing of western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis more likely .
An eventual end to the arms embargo against Iran would also be in the interest of the countryâ€ ™ s $ 15bn arms industry .
Moscow has argued that the embargo should be completely lifted so Iran can help fight Isis .
Losers Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi
The self - proclaimed caliph of the Islamic State may fear a more coherent international effort against his forces in Iraq and Syria given the new possibilities for cooperation between the US and Iran .
Iran has said in the past that the US is not serious about fighting terrorism , and complained that Washingtonâ€ ™ s close Arab allies â€ “ Saudi Arabia , Qatar and other Gulf states
â€ “ as well as Turkey have promoted jihadi groups .
It has already signalled that it may now be prepared to help .
King Salman bin Abdulaziz Saudi Arabiaâ€ ™ s initial silence about the agreement suggests deep anxiety about a rapprochement between the US and Iran , its greatest rival in the region , and a pivot away from the Gulf .
The view in Riyadh , Abu Dhabi and nearby capitals is that Washington is appeasing Tehran and ignoring their own security concerns â€ “ despite the Gulf statesâ€ ™ far greater expenditure on defence .
Salman strongly dislikes Iranâ€ ™ s role in Iraq , Syria , Bahrain and Yemen , where the Saudis are attacking Houthi rebels they say are backed by Tehran .
Sunni - Shia sectarianism is an alarming new element of a long - hostile relationship between Arabs and Persians .
Binyamin Netanyahu Israelâ€ ™ s prime minister had vowed to stop a nuclear agreement between the US and Iran .
Not only did he fail to do that
but he caused serious damage to Israelâ€ ™ s prized strategic relationship with Washington .
Critics at home say he exaggerated the extent of an Iranian threat , some calling for his resignation .
Iran has been notoriously hostile to the Jewish state since the 1979 revolution , and Tehran highlights its support for the Palestinians , including Hamas , and Lebanonâ€ ™ s Hezbollah .
Nothing in the Vienna agreement suggests that will change .
Israel also fears Iran may be emboldened .
Lifting sanctions gives â€œIran a jackpot , a cash bonanza of hundreds of billions of dollars , which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the worldâ€ � , Netanyahu claimed .
The focus on Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme has also drawn attention to Israelâ€ ™ s undeclared nuclear arsenal â€ “ outside the nuclear non - proliferation treaty .

2015-07-14,"As difficult as it was for President Hassan Rouhani to secure a nuclear agreement with world powers , it will be even more difficult for him to sustain popular support for one in Iran .
In a new poll conducted by IranPoll.com , a Toronto - based opinion research firm , in cooperation with the University of Maryland , a majority ( 57 % ) of Iranians backed a deal .
But this support rests on the assumption , held by most Iranians , that an agreement would result in better access to foreign medicine and medical equipment ( 61 % ) , significantly more foreign investment ( 62 % ) and an improvement in living standards ( 55 % ) , all within a year .
If these expectations are not realised , Rouhani would be left trying to explain who had pocketed the benefits of the deal and what Iran had received in return for curbing the nuclear programme .
This would be particularly challenging since 83 % of Iranians think it is â€œvery importantâ€ � for Iran to continue developing the nuclear programme .
The national telephone poll of 1,009 Iranians was conducted by IranPoll.com and Tehran University for University of Maryland 12 - 28 May 2015 , with a margin of error of 3.2 % .
Iranian support for the countryâ€ ™ s nuclear program has remained essentially unchanged across various polls conducted in Iran since 2006 .
The deal could introduce problems for Rouhani in other ways .
Iranâ€ ™ s
economy suffers from structural deficiencies that result mostly from mismanagement and corruption .
Until now , officials have been able to blame Iranâ€ ™ s sluggish economy on foreign sanctions .
But the situation after any agreement could pin blame for the underperforming economy squarely on the government .
In reaction the nuclear deal , Ali Tayebnia , Iranâ€ ™ s minister for economic affairs and finance , acknowledged these challenges .
â€œWith the deal , we need a few months after the implementation of the agreed processes by Iran and the west before the full effects of the lifting of the sanctions can manifest .
At the same time , people are worn down by the pressures of the past few years and expect a swift resolution to the countryâ€ ™ s economic problems.â€ �
Iran is in dire need of foreign investment , particularly in oil and gas .
While an agreement deal would lift many restrictions on such investment , it would not transform the situation overnight .
Banks and other financial institutions have not forgotten the severe fines introduced by the US for evading sanctions , and while the threat remains of renewed sanctions â€ “ likely to be present in an agreement under so - called â€˜snap backâ€ ™ provisions â€ “ major multinational companies will be reluctant to accept the risk of investing in Iran .
The most likely scenario , considering Iran now exports more than it imports and has a middle class with a taste for foreign goods , is that companies would see Iran as a profitable place to sell products rather than as somewhere to invest .
While this would reduce the price of many goods in Iran , it could bankrupt many Iranian industries unable to compete and so increase unemployment .
The initial â€œfeel good factorâ€ � from an agreement deal , tapping the suppressed development capacities of a well - educated 75 m strong population , might help
Rouhani carry public support in the short term .
But beyond that , there is no substitute for better economic management .

2015-07-23,"Bolstered domestically by the nuclear deal , Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , is now being urged to shift his attention to human rights .
Leading activists and lawyers are calling on the pragmatist cleric to replicate the political nous he showed over the nuclear issue and take rights violations off the back burner as he approaches the second half of his presidency .
Iranâ€ ™ s
use of executions , at a rate Amnesty International described on Thursday as â€œstaggeringâ€ � , is just one of the areas of concern , along with the tightening of freedom of expression , widespread discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities and the continuing prosecution of journalists , lawyers and rights campaigners in unfair trials .
Ahmed Shaheed , the UN special rapporteur in charge of investigating rights abuses in Iran , said : â€œRouhani made a number of election pledges which included ending the sanctions regime , but also a number of human rights promises .
He was preoccupied with the nuclear file ; he now should focus on human rights.â€ � Shaheed , who has been repeatedly blocked by the Iranian authorities from visiting the country , has documented rights violations and submitted detailed reports to the UN .
He has also warned against the unintended consequences of international sanctions , which he says could worsen the human rights situation .
Amnesty said on Thursday that there had been an unprecedented spike in the use of capital punishment , with Iran putting nearly 700 people to death in just over six months since the start of this year , the equivalent of executing more than three people a day .
If this alarming pace was not stopped , it warned , there could be about 1,000 state - sanctioned deaths by the end of 2015 .
Shaheed said that although rights violations were worsening , he did not regard Rouhani as directly responsible .
Most abuses in Iran are carried out by the hardline judiciary and the countryâ€ ™ s intelligence apparatus , which act independently of his government .
Rouhani could , however , use his position to highlight such abuses but has largely failed to speak out .
As many as 15 political prisoners have been released in the past two days , a respected journalist and a senior politician among them , but activists said most of them had been nearing the end of their prison terms and were due to be freed within a few months .
They said they were not sure if the releases signalled an opening up .
The ailing human rights activist and mother of two eight - year - olds , Narges Mohammadi , recently wrote a moving letter from inside jail which described the situation of other mothers in prison .
She wrote : â€œIn front of me is the bed of Sajedeh Arabsorkhi , who has not seen her nine - year - old for a year .
Beside me is [ the Bahaâ€ ™
i citizen ] Faran Hesami , who has been kept away from her son , who is now six , for three years .
On the other bed is Maryam Akbari , who hasnâ€ ™ t seen her daughter for six years .
Next door is Neda Mostaghimi , whose nine - year - old Ghazaleh is at home .
Iâ€ ™ m surrounded by 20 women , of whom ten are mothers and four have children below the age of 10.â€ � Nasrin Sotoudeh ,
Iranâ€ ™ s
most prominent human rights laywer , said the Iranian authorities had treated rights violations as a low priority for many years , citing various excuses such as war or international isolation .
But now , she said , it was time
Rouhani gave the matter his full attention .
â€œFrom the people who were released recently , only one person was a woman , which is disappointing , â€ �
Sotoudeh told the Guardian .
She said at least 18 women were currently being held in the womenâ€ ™ s ward of Tehranâ€ ™ s Evin prison .
â€œIran entered into negotiations with the international community to find a solution to the nuclear issue .
It should do the same at home and start dialogue with internal opponents and opposition.â€ �
Sotoudeh , famous for her work to abolish juvenile executions in Iran , fell foul of the authorities after defending many opposition activists and politicians following the disputed presidential elections in 2009 .
She was jailed in 2010 and subsequently sentenced to six years in prison and banned from practising law for 10 years .
Along with the filmmaker Jafar Panahi , Sotoudeh was the winner of the European parliamentâ€ ™ s most prestigious human rights award , the Sakharov Prize , in 2012 .
Since her unexplained release following Rouhaniâ€ ™ s election in 2013 , she has dedicated her time to staging numerous protests in front of government offices , demanding , among other things , that her right to work be reinstated .
Sotoudeh has often been accompanied by the families of political prisoners or other rights campaigners .
The authorities notified her recently that her ban had been lifted and said she could start work again as early as next month .
Jila Baniyaghoob , a journalist , said the recently released political prisoners had been pardoned on the occasion of Eid al - Fitr , marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan , when officials annually issue such pardons .
She did not think it was a sign the authorities were loosening their grip .
She said : â€œActually , in recent years , such pardons , easily given to criminals and smugglers , have been given to political prisoners on smaller scales .
Many of them were due to be released in a few months anyway .
We have prisoners of conscience who have not had a single dayâ€ ™ s leave from prison in seven or eight years , such as Fariba Kamalabadi or Mahvash Shahriari , who are Bahaâ€ ™ i.â€
�
Baniyaghoob estimated that there were about 1,000 male and female prisoners of conscience in Iranian prisons , but stressed that precise figures were not available .
â€œThere are many in jail who are not well known such as Bahaâ€ ™ is , Kurds and those accused of having links to [ the leftist opposition group ] Mujahedin.â€ �
Political prisoners in Iran are usually imprisoned on vague national security grounds and Rouhani has been trying to push the parliament and the judiciary to define what is a political crime .
The new Islamic penal code , adopted two years ago , makes clear that those in prison should only serve their maximum sentence if they are convicted on multiple grounds , but the authorities have failed to implement it , often making prisoners serve the entirety of their sentences .
Iranâ€ ™ s judiciary is particularly criticised for holding trials behind closed doors , which last only a few minutes and are often presided by judges acting under the influence of the intelligence authorities .
Other violations include long periods of solitary confinement , preventing detainees from meeting with their lawyers and family members , torture and ill - treatment , televising forced confessions and issuing hefty jail terms for peaceful activism ."
2015-07-24,"Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear deal with world powers followed two years of work by the state - run media preparing the public for the possibility of an agreement .
Before Hassan Rouhani was elected president in 2013 , media outlets affiliated to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , regarded both any â€œretreatâ€ � from uranium enrichment and talks between the foreign minister of the Islamic republic and the United States secretary of state as â€œred linesâ€ � that Iran should not cross .
But when Rouhaniâ€ ™ s team began a new round of talks , both red lines were crossed .
This needed to be explained to the public and particularly to strong supporters of the regime .
From the start , most media outlets under the control of the leader , including state - run radio and television networks , based their reporting on two assumptions drawn from Khameneiâ€ ™ s public statements .
The first was that nuclear talks between Iran and the US did not imply relations between the two countries were normalising .
The talksâ€ ™ purpose was to attempt a settlement over one issue , Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear dossier , and nothing more .
Within this context , many media outlets showed hostility to any signs of friendliness between the negotiators â€ “ including , famously , Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister , and John Kerry , US secretary of state , taking a stroll together along the Rhone river in Geneva .
The second assumption was that Iranâ€ ™ s change of position did not mean it had been forced to retreat by economic sanctions .
It was not easy to maintain this argument because stringent US and European Union energy and financial measures introduced in 2012 halved the countryâ€ ™ s exports , but given Khameneiâ€ ™ s determination to maintain an image of standing firm against any western pressure , there was little choice .
Downplaying the effect of sanctions had already proved a challenge towards the end of the previous administration of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when official media outlets had chosen to blame the governmentâ€ ™ s mismanagement and corruption for worsening economic conditions .
This had gone against their previous approach in presenting Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s administration as an outstanding model , but media affiliated to the leader seemed to conclude that the political damage would be less than acknowledging sanctions had created an economic crisis .
From mid-2013 , when Rouhani came to office , the media laid the groundwork for either success or failure in the nuclear talks .
Anticipating the possibility of failure , they focused on the leaderâ€ ™ s â€œpessimismâ€ � .
Khamenei stressed on many occasions his doubts that talks with the US would lead to a resolution of the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions , even though he did not oppose Rouhaniâ€ ™ s efforts to negotiate .
Some media outlets close to Khamenei emphasised that any officials who were too hopeful about the talks would come to realise their error .
Some , such as Kayhan daily , whose managing director is appointed by Khamenei , even stressed that the leader had accepted talks only to prove reaching agreement with the west was impossible .
A group of more hard - line conservatives , calling themselves â€œthe concernedâ€ � , went further in accusing the Iranian negotiators of undermining â€œnational dignityâ€ � .
Media outlets close to this group â€ “ such as the Fars News Agency , which is affiliated to the Revolutionary Guards â€ “ portrayed sanctions as completely unimportant and Iranâ€ ™ s uranium enrichment as a vital symbol of national interest .
From their perspective , any concessions would signal failure or naivety , even if they led to sanctions being lifted .
Although this did not match the official position , Khamenei gave no indication he was uncomfortable with their position .
This was possibly because the leader did not wish the talks , even if they led to the lifting of sanctions , to result in any strengthening of a view that wider talks with the US were desirable .
Probably the best - known phrase of Khamenei used by the state - run media during the talks was â€œheroic flexibilityâ€ � .
The leader adopted the term shortly after Rouhani was elected and was preparing to travel to New York for the annual UN General Assembly .
The leader wanted to make clear that the Islamic republic remained a â€œrevolutionaryâ€ � regime that would not surrender to pressure .
A group of conservative news outlets affiliated to Khamenei strived to show that whatever nuclear agreement Iran reached , it would not mean a retreat by the leader .
They suggested , for instance , that Iranâ€ ™ s agreement with more international controls on its nuclear programme would only constitute a tactic to show how wrong the west was about the goals of the countryâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
At the same time , these very outlets also showed sensitivity - that Rouhaniâ€ ™ s administration should not take the credit if talks succeeded .
So while maintaining a critical outlook towards the nuclear talks , they argued that any progress made in the talks would be due to Khameneiâ€ ™ s position .
This approach was simultaneous with the leaderâ€ ™ s drive to avoid accepting any responsibility for a retreat in the nuclear programme .
A week after a framework agreement was announced in Lausanne in April , Khamenei said the congratulatory messages that some government officials were sending him were â€œmeaninglessâ€ � because no important event had yet taken place , and the leader even claimed he was unaware of the details of the talks .
Since the final nuclear agreement on 14 July , Khamenei has praised the negotiatorsâ€ ™ efforts but refrained from defending the agreement .
Hence the leader has an odd kind of responsibility for the outcome of the talks .
Media outlets affiliated to him have attributed any concessions ( on enrichment or other issues ) to Rouhaniâ€ ™ s administration , and any successes ( on sanctions ) to the leader .
This will continue as the deal moves towards implementation .

2015-07-29,"It promises to be a rhetorical battle of the titans , on a scale not seen for at least a decade .
On a Monday morning in late September , Barack Obama , Vladimir Putin , Hassan Rouhani , Xi Jinping and FranÃ§ois Hollande are all scheduled to deliver speeches at the United Nations in New York , setting out their visions of the geopolitical landscape at the outset of a highly uncertain era .
The vagaries of the timetable at the general assembly meeting marking the 70th anniversary of the UN mean all five leaders will be addressing the chamber within the space of a couple of highly charged hours .
Putinâ€ ™ s plans to attend for the first time in a decade has added spice .
It will also be Xiâ€ ™ s general assembly debut .
It will be the first joint appearance on a public stage of Obama and Rouhani since the Iran nuclear deal agreed this month in Vienna , and there is great anticipation that the two presidents could meet for the first time .
Last year they spoke by phone as Rouhani was leaving town .
On this occasion , by the time the presidents mount the famous green marble podium , the US Congress is expected to have voted to reject the Vienna agreement , and Obama could be in the position of counting votes in a scramble to ensure he can sustain a presidential veto of the congressional vote .
The domestic politics around an Obama - Rouhani meeting could once more prove awkward .
Before 2013 , the greatest tensions in the UN chamber were provided by Rouhaniâ€ ™ s mercurial predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
This September , Russiaâ€ ™ s combative president , speaking an hour after Obama , is the most likely to provide rhetorical fireworks .
Putinâ€ ™ s office has not confirmed his participation but has said preparations are under way for him to attend .
He will be on the defensive in the face of widespread censure at the UN over Russiaâ€ ™ s annexation of Crimea , its military role in eastern Ukraine and the downing of flight MH17 .
Putinâ€ ™ s tone and choice of words will be closely scrutinised for signs of conciliation or a further drift towards cold war - style animosity .
â€œThe wild card will be Putin .
Will he play the role of the great dealmaker who supported the Iran agreement , or will he be in all - out anti - American mode?â€ �
Richard Gowan , a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank , said .
â€œObama will be in the tricky position of speaking before his two main geopolitical rivals .
If he lauds their cooperation over Iran , rightwing American critics will claim heâ€ ™ s gone soft on China and Russia .
If he throws in any tough lines about Ukraine , as he did last year , or the South China Sea , Xi and Putin will be able to take the podium and accuse him of making trouble .
â€œI can only imagine that the [ US ] State Department will be trying to coordinate very closely with Moscow and Beijing , and the CIA will be working very hard to get early drafts of their texts , â€ � Gowan said .
The last time there was a lineup of such powerful figures at the UN was at its 60th anniversary world summit in 2005 .
George Bush and Tony Blair were then the leaders under pressure because of the disastrous invasion of Iraq two years before .
Xiâ€ ™
s
predecessor Hu Jintao spoke for China , and then French prime minister , Dominique de Villepin , stood in for his president , Jacques Chirac .
Putin was there in his first presidency .
He is the only global leader at that summit still in power a decade later .
British PM David Cameron is expected to be in New York on the opening day , for meetings with other leaders on the margins of the general debate , but he may duck out of the Tuesday night speech , leaving it to this foreign secretary , Philip Hammond .
Cameronâ€ ™ s office has yet to announce its plans .
The provisional running order is subject to change , but is set largely according to protocol , with heads of states taking precedence over heads of government , who speak before mere ministers .
By a quirk of UN history , having chaired the first general debate , Brazil always gets to speak first on the opening morning of the general debate , followed by the US as the hosts .
The current UK slot is just before 9 pm EST ( 1 am GMT ) on Tuesday29 September , when the UN chamber will be exhausted from listening to speeches from Uruguay , Lithuania , Seychelles , Czech Republic , Tanzania and leaders of 13 other countries ."
2015-08-24,"Britain will â€œtread carefullyâ€ � as it rebuilds relations with Iran , but the countries need to work together to tackle problems like Islamic State , Philip Hammond has said .
The British foreign secretary â€ “ speaking from Tehran on Monday , following the reopening of Britainâ€ ™ s embassy in the city and ahead of a meeting with the Iranian president
, Hassan Rouhani â€ “ said that , although relations had been improving , the countries had a â€œdifficult historyâ€ � .
But it was better for them to engage with each other , and in time Iran could play â€œa more measured and more responsibleâ€ � role in the Middle East , he said .
The embassy was closed in 2011 after being ransacked by anti - British protesters .
It has reopened after a thaw in relations following Iranâ€ ™ s agreement last month with the international community on restricting its nuclear programme in return for a lifting of sanctions .
Hammond said he wanted to build on this progress , but Britain had to proceed cautiously .
â€œWe are trying to develop cordial relations with what is a very important country in a volatile and difficult region , â€ � he told BBC Radio 4â€ ™ s Today programme .
â€œYes , we should tread carefully .
Thereâ€ ™ s a deep legacy of distrust on both sides .
And we have major areas where we have very substantial policy differences .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t mean that we shouldnâ€ ™ t be talking , that we shouldnâ€ ™ t attempt dialogue , that we shouldnâ€ ™ t discuss areas where we do see eye to eye.â€ �
Hammond said that the two countries had a shared interest in matters such as tackling Isis and the opium trade .
He also questioned whether Iran was really committed to destroying Israel .
When it was put to him that this was Iranian policy , he said that that was the position of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s predecessor and Rouhani had a â€œmore nuanced approachâ€ � .
When challenged about Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , also calling for death to Israel , Hammond said this rhetoric might not reflect Iranâ€ ™ s real intentions .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got to distinguish between revolutionary sloganising and what Iran actually does in the conduct of its foreign policy , â€ �
he said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got to , as we do with quite a number of countries , distinguish the internal political consumption rhetoric from the reality of the way they conduct their foreign policy.â€ �
Hammond , the first British foreign secretary to visit Tehran since 2003 , acknowledged that Iran was responsible for sponsoring groups that he said had a destabilising effect on the region , although he did not name them .
But he said it was a mistake not to engage with the country .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got to engage with Iran as a major player in the region in order to seek to influence it .
If we donâ€ ™ t talk to the Iranians , if we stand off and simply shout at each other through megaphones , we will not be able to influence the development of Iranian policy , we will not have good insight into Iranian thinking , and Iran is too large a player , too important a player in this region , to simply leave in isolation without any interaction with them.â€ �
He went on : â€œWe
all know that if you isolate somebody , they tend to become more belligerent , not less .
So an Iran that is less isolated , that is gradually reintegrating into the international system , hopefully will be an Iran that in due course will start to play a more measured and more responsible role in this region .
â€œSo long as it [ pursues its policies ] in a responsible way , according to the norms of the international community , Iran can become a positive actor in this region once trust is rebuilt.â€ �
Hammond said this was similar to Britainâ€ ™ s approach to Russia .
While it was opposed to Russiaâ€ ™ s actions in Ukraine , it also recognised the need to work with Russia on issues where they had shared interests , such as Syria , he said ."
2015-08-24,"The UK foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , has said that â€œa new phaseâ€ � has been entered in the search for a resolution to the Syrian conflict with the thawing of relations between the west and Iran paving the way for possible talks .
Hammond spoke on Monday after meeting the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , on the second day of a two - day trip to Iran , during which he opened the UK embassy after a four - year closure .
He said Iran and Britain were keen to use the conclusion of an agreement on the formerâ€ ™ s nuclear programme in July as an opportunity to discuss Syria and other regional issues .
He said : â€œUp to now , weâ€ ™ ve been having a discussion among ourselves in the west , without the two most important and influential players in Syria â€ “ Iran and Russia â€ “ being in the room .
That may be very gratifying to us , but it is not going to get us to a political solution .
If weâ€ ™ re going to get to a political solution , we need to have the Iranians and Russians in the process as well.â€
�
Hammond said the level of talks with Russia on the Syrian war had deepened in recent months and now Iran was at the table as well .
â€œNow weâ€ ™ ve got the opportunity for Iran to be engaged in that discussion with us and that makes it a more realistic discussion , so I think there is a new phase .
â€œThat isnâ€ ™ t to say that it throws up instant solutions .
In fact , in the early stages of the new phase it serves to underscore the depths of the differences between us on the one hand and the Iranians and the Russians on the other .
But if you donâ€ ™ t talk you

™ t make progress , and we are now talking.â€ �
He said the principal disagreement remained the future of the Syrian president , Bashar al - Assad , with Iran seeing him as â€œthe glue that holds much of Syria togetherâ€ � while the UK believes â€œthat a man with so much blood on his hands can not be part of the countryâ€ ™ s
futureâ€ � .
Rouhani received Hammond at the presidential palace on Monday morning and said he welcomed the reopening of the British embassy .
Hammond said later there was no time to get into a detailed discussion on Syria , but he held talks with the Iranian foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , on Sunday , and the secretary of Iranâ€ ™ s supreme national security council , Ali Shamkani , on Monday .
He said : â€œWhat we have identified today is quite a bit of misunderstanding of each otherâ€ ™ s positions .
That inevitably occurs when you donâ€ ™ t talk to each other .
At least now having our embassies open , having channels of dialogue open , means we are going to get a growing understanding of the Iranian positions and what their red lines are.â€
�
It was Hammondâ€
™ s first visit to Iran and the first by a British foreign secretary in 12 years .
He said the two days of talks with Iranian leaders had helped break down assumptions and stereotypes on both sides .
Hammond said : â€œMy personal impression , never having been to Iran before , is that I suspect many people in Britain and the west will have had an image of Iran as a desperately theocratic , deeply religious society motivated by ideology .
â€œBut what Iâ€ ™ ve seen is a perfectly normal , bustling , dynamic , entrepreneurial , thrusting , middle - income developing world city that has clearly enormous potential ; not a regimented , disciplined society under the thumb of the authority .
â€œOne of the things that struck me most was that our police escorts as theyâ€ ™ ve driven us around the city have struggled to persuade Iranian motorists and motorcyclists to do their bidding .
I donâ€
™ t get the impression of a population cowed by authority.â€ �
He said of the Iranian perspective : â€œI also detect a change in the approach , the language , the rhetoric around the UK .
I sense we are seen now more as part of Europe ... and less of the imperial Britain of the past with its legacy of involvement in Iran and the region.â€

Hammond visited the Commonwealth war cemetery in Gholhak Garden , the embassyâ€ ™
s
second compound , in northern Tehran .
Although the compound was occupied by radicals during the embassy invasion in November 2011 , the graves were left untouched .
A British diplomat said : â€œThey were very respectful of the cemetery.â€ �"
2015-09-02,"Across from the public garden on 28th street , in the Khani Abad neighbourhood near the Grand Bazaar , 39-year - old Ali passes a hot summerâ€ ™ s day leaning against his old motorcycle .
The 2013 presidential elections came soon after he was released from a four - year prison term for theft .
Aliâ€ ™
s
older brother suggested voting for Hassan Rouhani as a â€œsolidâ€ � man .
â€œThe country was in shambles and everyoneâ€ ™ s situation was so desperately horrible , â€ � says Ali .
â€œIâ€ ™
d been free only for two months , and prison had taken a toll on me .
My brother said Rouhani would bring more jobs .
So we voted for him and I encouraged some of my friends from prison to vote for him too.â€ �
This August marks the end of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s second year as president , but Ali says his hopes have not come to fruition .
â€œTwo years ago we were sitting right here , around my motorcycle , smoking cigarettes , and right now here weâ€ ™ re doing the same .
Before I ended up in theft
I was an auto mechanic and I could do some basic electrical stuff too like repairing air conditioners , fans and juicers .
â€œBut Iâ€ ™ ve been to a hundred places all over town looking for work - any work - and no one is hiring .
Artisans and craftsmen no longer take apprentices .
You know why ?
They donâ€ ™ t have the money to pay wages .
Mr Rouhani told us he would give us jobs , but he left us out to dry.â€ � Ali became addicted to crystal meth in prison , but in the winter of 2013 he kicked the habit .
â€œMy two years of being clean coincides with Rouhaniâ€ ™ s presidency .
I go to the support groups , and many of the others who got clean are also unemployed , which is the quickest and easiest path back to addiction .
In my opinion , Rouhani does feel for the people , but the leaders wonâ€ ™ t let him do anything .
â€œI think he should start a few textile and machine - part factories in poorer areas .
There are thousands like me who are ready to go to work from dawn to ten at night , if they knew they could earn good money.â€ �
Ali lives with his mother in an old , rented 60 square - foot home .
â€œMy mother was overjoyed when I got out of prison .
She was so lonely without me .
When I kicked the drug habit I promised her Iâ€ ™
d rent her a good place , maybe even buy one if we got a loan .
But whoâ€ ™ s giving out loans ?
And how are people supposed to get money ?
From jobs .
â€œPrices have been going up for two years -
I canâ€
™ t buy fruit or meat for my mother or take her to the cinema once in a while .
For six months I worked at a syrup factory on Karaj Road and they didnâ€ ™ t pay me for three of those months .
They said they had too many workers and told me to leave , just like that .
Why doesnâ€ ™ t
the ministry of labour do something about this ?
Didnâ€
™ t Rouhani come to power for this very reason ?
Arenâ€ ™ t
I a Muslim ?
What kind of Islamic governance is this?â€ � Ali has followed the nuclear negotiations closely and accepts that Rouhaniâ€ ™ s focus during these two years has been securing a deal .
â€œThank
God they reached an agreement .
Rouhani has worked hard to make it happen .
When youâ€ ™ re under sanctions , the economy simply doesnâ€ ™ t move -
now the river is flowing again , he must let all the people drink from it .
He mustnâ€
™ t just allow the wealth to go into the pockets of the wealthy.â€ �
Ali says he is hopeful for the future , but also fearful .
â€œJoblessness and the cost of living are like fire and petrol : high prices act like petrol on the wildfire of unemployment .
Sometimes the situation makes me miss prison .
At least there was more order there ; everything was calmer .
Out here itâ€ ™ s all so gloomy and depressing .
If Rouhani canâ€ ™ t make things right , I might go back to crime.â€ �
While Aliâ€ ™ s grievances with Rouhani centre on jobs , Marjan , a 40-year old woman who lives in Shariati Street in the affluent north Tehran neighbourhood of Ghalhak , has other concerns .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been at war with the police over my hejab since I was
16,â€
� she said .
â€œI voted for Mr Rouhani so he would improve the economy and keep these idiots off the streets .
But just this year alone Iâ€ ™ ve been picked up in their vans three times.â€ �
By â€˜vansâ€ ™ Marjan means the police vehicles stationed along the main thoroughfares in central and north Tehran that take women in violation of the dress code to police stations around the city to be processed and usually fined .
â€œDidnâ€ ™ t Rouhani say he wanted to reinstate the rule of law ?
So do something about it !
Is it too much to ask for just one person to stand by his word here ?
â€œI like Rouhani .
That he was able to secure the nuclear deal was really something .
But everything isnâ€ ™ t just about the economy and national security .
Iâ€ ™ m an educated woman ; I have rights .
A president is supposed to defend the rights of the people .
Heâ€
™ s supposed to prevent the police and Basij from doing whatever they want to people in the street .
Heâ€
™ s not supposed to drag us to heaven , but he also shouldnâ€ ™ t leave us stranded in hell.â€ �
Other perspectives can be found .
Abbas , 42 , runs a Samsung outlet on Jomhouri Street , says thing are improving since he fell on hard times after the United States and European Union tightened sanctions in 2012 .
â€œI was almost bankrupt .
From 2012 to 2014 it was really bad .
Goods were held up in customs and it took all kinds of bribes and shady dealing to free them up .
The value of the dollar was jumping up and down each day , so people expected currency fluctuations and they bought less .
There were months when I sold only three televisions .
â€œEven if Rouhani had done nothing else , stabilising the currency was an economic renaissance for Iranians .
Now thereâ€ ™ s some semblance of order in the market , and people are slowly returning to their normal lives .
I deal with customers every day .
People have calmed down at last , finally theyâ€ ™ re able to breathe .
â€œRouhani is a president who stood by his word .
Once the funds free up in the aftermath of the nuclear deal , hopefully the price of the dollar will continue to drop and the market will bounce back .
Iâ€ ™ m hopeful for Rouhaniâ€ ™ s last two years .
And if he stands a second time , he has my vote.â€

In Laleh Park , central Tehran , 79-year - old Mohammad Reza sits on a bench with two friends he says heâ€ ™ s known since they were all 16 .
For seven years , Mohammad Reza has come to Laleh Park each day except Thursdays and Friday to â€œpass my retirement with some good quality people - watchingâ€ � .
Mohammad Reza takes a long - term perspective on politics : â€œI saw the coup dâ€ ™ Ã © tat [ the 1953 toppling of Mohammad Mossadegh as prime minister ] , the revolution [ of 1979 ] , the war [ with Iraq , 1980 - 88 ] .
Iranâ€ ™ s main weakness has been expecting too much from our leaders .
I donâ€
™ t mean to suggest we should have no expectations from government , but we shouldnâ€ ™ t put everything at their feet .
People need to take responsibility as well .
â€œFor
35 years Iranians have come out to vote every four years , and then theyâ€ ™ ve gone home and just sat and waited .
This isnâ€ ™ t how things get done .
They have to have continuing discussions , to work , and hold meetings .
â€œWe
all ask what Rouhani did , but what have we done ?
Allow me to quote the great film - maker Ali Hatami :
â€˜I donâ€ ™ t just express my wishes ; I make them come true.â€
™ People have to be like this in politics .
â€œThe foreigners do it .
They go into various arenas and state their demands , they fight for them .
Voting is just one moment out of millions of other crucial ones .
They donâ€ ™ t sit at home and say , â€˜Mr President , Mr Prime Minister , please fix everything.â€ ™ They protest , they participate directly , and the president provides the legal protection .
In my opinion the question of what Rouhani did in these two years is too convenient a question .
A better one is .
â€˜What did we do?â€ ™ .â€ �

2015-09-25,"Iran is stepping up efforts to implement a landmark nuclear deal by January so as to benefit from sanctions relief , with European companies lining up for what one investor described as the most attractive opportunity in frontier markets globally .
President Hassan Rouhani , who is visiting New York to speak at the UN general assembly next week , said at a meeting with journalists and media executives on Friday that â€œconditions were ripeâ€ � for his administration to start implementing the agreement , struck in Vienna in July , by the end of the year .
His comments were echoed by business leaders and world investors participating in the first international conference studying investment and trade opportunities in Iran since the nuclear accord .
The second Europe - Iran forum took place over the course of two days in Geneva , ending on Friday .
European corporations have already begun pursuing lucrative contracts in Iran .
Philippe Delleur , the president of Alstom â€ “ the French electricity generation and rail transport firm â€
“ was in the French delegation visiting Tehran earlier this week .
He was participating in the Geneva forum to meet other investors .
â€œWe have a very positive reputation because of our past projects in Iran
but of course we had to restrict our activities according to the international sanctions
, â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œAnd now we are very happy to see that sanctions are going to end and once they are lifted we would be happy to resume our activities.â€ �
Alstom had maintained its office in Tehran even during sanctions .
It is now focusing on railway projects and is hoping to work on expansion of the metro in Tehran and building two more lines in the city of Mashhad as well as participating in the electrification of the 1,000 km ( 600-mile ) Tehran - Mashhad railway .
It also wants to build a very high speed line between Tehran and popular tourist destination Isfahan .
Delleur said : â€œAlstom aims to provide all type of equipment for electrification , for the signalling and for rolling stock in these projects .
But we will do nothing before the time sanctions are lifted .
â€œWe are used to cooperating with Iranians , weâ€ ™ ve had excellent Iranian engineers in our companies and we are sure to be able to partner with Iranians again .
Weâ€ ™ re quite confident when sanctions are lifted our presence will grow.â€ �
The Guardian understands that the French industrial group Bouygues and AÃ © roports de Paris are in talks with Iran to construct the countryâ€ ™ s largest transport project , the second terminal at Tehranâ€ ™ s Imam Khomeini international airport .
Bouygues , which recently opened an office in Tehran , also has its eyes on Iranâ€ ™
s need for 7,000 more hospital beds , or more than 15 institutions .
Alisher Ali , the founder of Mandalay Capital , based in Malta , said his firm had already invested in a number of banks and holding companies listed on the Tehran stock exchange .
â€œI think Iran represents the biggest opportunity in frontier markets globally , â€ � he said .
â€œOut of 40 [ or ] 30 frontier - market countries , Iran is the most attractive.â€ �
On 18 October , dubbed adoption day , Iran will begin taking steps to meet its obligations under the nuclear accord and the US will issue some waivers for specific sanctions .
But the defining moment is what has become known as implementation day , when the International Atomic Energy Agency verifies that Tehran has taken the necessary steps .
Implementation day is when EU sanctions will be lifted and US sanctions suspended .
Iranians hope that date will be as early as the beginning of 2016 but Americans are sceptical it will happen that soon .
Sceptics believe it might take Iran up to six months to meet its obligations .
Western firms will have the green light to conduct business in Iran from implementation day , according to Abdulrasoul Dorri Esfahani , senior adviser to the governor of the Central Bank of Iran .
â€œIran is now there for you as a partner , â€ � Esfahani said .
Giulio Haas , the Swiss ambassador to Tehran , said westerners needed to take care when dealing with Iran .
â€œOne
thing is clear , there are a lot of opportunities in Iran , â€ � he said .
â€œBut you have to go after them carefully .
This is not North Korea , but the key problem is international financing.â€ �
For some banks , it doesnâ€ ™ t make sense to have all the hassle , he said .
â€œThere are European banks who can deal with Iran even now , â€ � said Andreas Schweitzer , from Arjan Capital , a Maltese company involved in the wind power industry in Iran .
â€œSmall banks which have no business with the US work with Iran .
Big banks in theory can operate too but they have reputation issues.â€ �
There were more Iranian projects than international money to invest , Schweitzer said , but more international money to invest than Iranian projects that met international standards .
â€œIran now has the characteristics of East Germany in 1989 because it had to operate within itself .
The end of sanctions in effect is Iranâ€ ™ s Berlin Wall moment , â€ � he said .

2015-09-25,"The deployment of Russian troops in Syria could end up helping Islamic State as they have been sent to areas where they are most likely to fight other groups opposed to Isis , according to a new report .
The Royal United Services Institute ( Rusi ) report comes ahead of a US - Russian summit meeting at the UN on Monday , when Barack Obama will question Vladimir Putin on the intention behind Russiaâ€ ™ s deepening military involvement in Syria , according to US officials .
The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani â€ “ also in New York for the UN general assembly meeting
â€ “ rejected suggestions that his country was operating in concert with Russia against Isis .
â€œI do not see a coalition between Iran and Russia on fighting terrorism in Syria , â€ �
Rouhani said .
The Rusi report , titled Inherently Unresolved , assesses the global effort to counter the spread of Isis , and warns that Iraq and Syria may not survive as unitary states .
It includes a section on Russian aims , particularly those underpinning Putinâ€ ™ s despatch this month of warplanes and troops to Tartus and Latakia in support of Bashar al - Assadâ€ ™ s regime .
Igor Sutyagin , a Russian strategic analyst , said there was an air regiment at Latakia with 28 planes , a battalion of motorised infantry and military engineers as well as a marine battalion at the naval base in Tartus .
The deployment , Sutyagin said , â€œunderlines the contradictions of the Kremlinâ€ ™ s policyâ€ � , because the troops were in areas where Isis is not present .
â€œIn this way , Russian troops are backing Assad in the fight against groups such as Jabhat al - Nusra and Ahrar al - Sham , which are themselves opposed to Isis .
If Russian troops do eventually join combat , therefore , they would also â€ “ technically
â€ “ be assisting Isis , â€ � Sutyagin argued .
The report says the Russian deployment should not therefore be seen as a change of policy towards fighting Isis directly , but a largely political move designed to save Assad and consolidate Russiaâ€ ™ s hold over its naval base at Tartus and its newly built air base in Latakia , while currying favour with the west and the Gulf Arab states who are themselves reluctant to fight Isis on the ground .
â€œIndeed , the Kremlin may well be hoping that the west will show its appreciation by lifting the sanctions imposed in response to the situation in Ukraine , â€ � Sutyagin said .
The tensions hanging over the Obama - Putin meeting on Monday were highlighted by discord between Washington and Moscow in describing the summit .
US officials said it had been requested by Putin .
A Russian spokesman insisted it was Obama who asked to meet .
The White House said the meeting would address both the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria .
The Kremlin said Ukraine would only be raised â€œif there was timeâ€ � .
Celeste Wallander , the White House National Security Councilâ€ ™ s senior director for Russia , said that Obama would press Putin on his objectives in Syria .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot of talk , and now itâ€ ™ s time for clarity and for Russia to come clear
â€ “ come clean and come clear on just exactly how it proposes to be a constructive contributor to what is already an ongoing multi - nation coalition , â€ �
Wallander told journalists .
Putin meanwhile told CBS News : â€œThere is no other solution to the Syrian crisis than strengthening the effective government structures and rendering them help in fighting terrorism .
But at the same time , urging them to engage in positive dialogue with the rational opposition and conduct reform.â€ � The White House argues that the Russian strategy of entrenching Assad will only serve to deepen the roots of extremism in Syria .
Ben Rhodes , a White House spokesman , said that at the UN meeting â€œthe president will have the opportunity to make clear to President Putin that we share the determination to counter Isil [ Isis ] , that we welcome constructive contributions to counter Isil .
But at the same time , we believe that one of the principal motivating factors for people who are fighting with Isil is the Assad regime.â€
�
The Rusi report said that it would be â€œperfectly feasibleâ€ � to defeat Isis if Turkey and Iran were also engaged in the search for a regional solution .
It advised US policymakers to â€œnot give up on the possibility of maintaining the unity of Iraq and Syria , but not be beholden or obsessed with this idea eitherâ€ � .
â€œIf the US could â€˜fatherâ€ ™ two brand - new states in the Balkans during the 1990s , there is no reason why Washington should not tolerate at least the informal emergence of new states in the Middle East , â€ � the report argued ."
2015-09-26,"Iranian president Hassan Rouhani used a major United Nations speech on Saturday to demand an investigation into a crush that killed more than 750 people at the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia .
His remarks came after Saudi Arabiaâ€ ™ s most senior cleric , the grand mufti , appeared to absolve the authorities of blame for the stampede at Mecca .
â€œYou are not responsible for what happened , â€ �
grand mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin - Abdullah al - Sheikh was quoted by the official Saudi press agency , SPA , as telling the interior minister , Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef .
â€œAs for the things that humans can not control
, you are not blamed for them .
Fate and destiny are inevitable , â€ � he added during the meeting , reported to have happened on Friday night .
On Saturday , the Saudi health ministry said on Twitter that the death toll of the hajj disaster stood at 769 pilgrims killed and 934 injured , updating previous figures .
It did not offer nationalities for the dead and injured , but Tehran says more than 130 of the dead were Iranians .
The fact that Rouhani used a UN summit meeting on global development goals to reiterate his countryâ€ ™ s outrage was a sign that it does not intend to tone down criticism of its regional rival Saudi Arabia .
Both Iran and the Saudis see themselves as leaders in the Muslim world .
In his speech to the 193-nation UN General Assembly , Rouhani emphasized the need for an investigation into â€œthe causes of this incident and other similar incidents in this yearâ€ ™ s hajjâ€ � , Reuters reported .
He describe the crush as â€œheart - rendingâ€ � .
Speaking to reporters before a meeting with US secretary of state John Kerry , Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif repeated that â€œwe need to address the disastrous event in Saudi Arabiaâ€ � .
Saudi Arabia on Friday suggested pilgrims ignoring crowd control rules bore some blame for the incident .
Saudi Arabiaâ€ ™ s
King Salman ordered a review of hajj plans , and Health Minister Khalid al - Falih said an investigation would be conducted .
Iran has repeatedly expressed outrage at the deaths of more than 130 of its nationals at
the worldâ€ ™ s largest annual gathering of people .
Rouhani suggested on Friday the tragedy might have been a result of the Saudis transferring experienced troops to Yemen to fight Iranian - backed Houthi rebels , a military campaign that Tehran has repeatedly criticized ."
2015-09-28,"The United States did not invite Iran to Tuesdayâ€ ™ s UN summit on combating Islamic State and other violent extremist groups because it still designates Iran itself as a state sponsor of terrorism .
Even if he had been invited , it is not clear if Iranian President Hassan Rouhani would have taken part .
He has made clear he has different views to the Obama administration on fighting Isis , and he will cut short his attendance at this weekâ€ ™ s UN summit , leaving for Tehran after making his speech to the general assembly on Monday morning to lead mourning for the more than 150 Iranian victims of the Hajj stampede in Mecca .
However , the absence of an invitation to a critical meeting on violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq , an issue in which Iran has a major stake , illustrates the remaining institutional and political barriers to US cooperation with Iran even after the successful negotiation of an agreement on its nuclear programme in July .
US State Department officials confirmed that Iranâ€ ™ s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism was the reason for its exclusion from the countering Isis summit being chaired by Obama on Tuesday .
Iran was first designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the State Department in 1984 and the designation has been rolled over each year .
The latest State Department report said : â€œIran continued its terrorist - related activity in 2014 , including support for Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza , Lebanese Hezbollah , and various groups in Iraq and throughout the Middle East.â€ �
The US also accused Iran of increasing assistance to Iraqi Shia militias , one of which was designated a terrorist organisation , â€œin response to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant incursion into Iraq , and has continued to support other militia groups in the regionâ€ � .
Iranian officials have complained that about being stigmatised by backing militia groups fighting Isis , something the US is also attempting to do .
The state sponsor of terrorism label does not present a legal barrier to negotiating with a national government , a fact that allowed the nuclear negotiations to take place , so there is an element of discretion in its application .
â€œThese labels and lists reduce American manoeuvrability and flexibility at a time when agility is a critical property in foreign policy , â€ � said Trita Parsi , the head of the National Iranian - American Council , an advocacy group promoting diplomacy with Iran .
â€œFor Iran , some of these things become a litmus test for American sincerity .
It may or may not have been interested in taking part
but it is enormously insulted not to be
invited.â€ �
Ilan Goldenberg , a former senior State Department official who is now Middle East director at the Center for a New American Security thinktank , said that the invocation of the state sponsor status was largely a matter of discretion and covered a host of underlying political problems .
â€œPolitically , it is too soon for both sides , â€ � Goldenberg said .
â€œWe still have the Arabs to manage .
If we invite in the Iranians we anger the Saudis and the other Gulf states .
And for political reasons , too , since the nuclear deal , the administration has tacked to the right.â€ �
He added that in Iran , the Sspreme leader , Ali Khamenei , had declared himself opposed to greater engagement with Iran beyond the nuclear deal .
Speaking to Iran policy analysts in New York on Sunday , Rouhani indicated his views on combating Isis were closer to Russians than to the West , insisting that priority be given to fighting the extremist group first without weakening the Assad regime in Damascus .
Only after that , he said , should reform in Damascus be addressed ."
2015-09-28,"Under pressure from home critics to cut short his UN visit and return to Tehran in the face of a growing number of Iranian deaths in the hajj crush , Hassan Rouhani started his speech at the UN general assembly with remembering the Iranian victims , criticising Saudi Arabia and urging an investigation into the tragedy .
It emerged on Monday that the latest Iranian death toll stands at 228 while as many as 248 people are still missing , according to local media â€ “ significantly higher than previously thought .
â€œMany who had come together in the spiritual gathering hajj unfortunately fell victims to incompetence and mismanagement of those in charge , â€ �
Rouhani said , adding that Saudi â€œunaccountabilityâ€ � has prevented identifying the missing people and the return of dead bodies to Iran .
â€œPublic opinion demands that Saudi Arabian officials promptly fulfill their international obligations and grant immediate consular access , â€ � he said , referring to the difficulties Iranian officials have faced trying to obtain Saudi visas to travel to Mecca to deal with the crisis .
â€œIt is necessary to prepare for an independent and precise investigation into causes of this disaster and ways to prevent its repetition in the future.â€ �
Rouhani used a large part of his speech to focus on the landmark Iranian nuclear deal struck in Vienna in July and lay out its consequences for Iran and the west , saying â€œwe wonâ€ ™ t forget the past but we do not want to live in the pastâ€ � .
He was referring to the international sanctions that in his opinion , and that of many Iranians , unjustly punished the country for some years .
â€œToday a new chapter has started in Iranâ€ ™ s relations with the world , â€ �
Rouhani said , emphasising that the Iranian people chose the path of â€œhope and moderationâ€ � two years ago by electing him to office in Iran , a country he described as a â€œreligious democracyâ€ � .
Rouhani attacked Israel a couple of times , saying â€œthe Zionist regimeâ€ � was the only impediment to securing the nuclear agreement .
He later criticised the US for extending unwavering support for Tel Aviv and ignoring the plight of what he described as â€œoppressed Palestiniansâ€ � .
He said the US was pursuing â€œbaseless accusations and pursuing other dangerous policiesâ€ � in defence of its regional allies cultivating extremism , presumably referring to Saudi Arabia and Israel .
Rouhani urged the world to form a â€œunited frontâ€ � against extremism and violence and said the biggest threat facing the world is if terrorist organisations become a terrorist state , referring to the Islamic State .
â€œWe are prepared to assist in eradication of terrorism .
We are prepared to help bring democracy to Syria , Yemen , â€ � he said , adding that Iran wants peace in the region and it would be a win - win situation .
He added that Iran wants to become a business hub in the region and Iranian business leaders say that the Rouhani administration wants them to act swiftly .
â€œOur authorities insist that the work of our diplomacy and economic apparatus is almost finished so they want our economic sector and private companies to steer the wheel now and benefit from the situation , â€ � Ali Sanginian , CEO at Amin Investment bank , an asset management group , told the Guardian .
â€œWe were hurt a lot under sanctions and we were almost standing on the edge but people in Iran want to feel the benefits of sanctions relief in their daily life as soon as possible.â€ �"
2015-09-29,"Britain and the US are miles apart from Iran and Russia on how to stop the bloodshed in Syria because Tehran and Moscow will not contemplate the end of the Assad regime , David Cameron has said .
The prime minister said working to end the four - year Syrian civil war was the â€œmost difficult , intractable problemâ€ � that he and the US president , Barack Obama , had faced , as he gave the clearest explanation yet of the differences between the world leaders .
In an interview on US television on Tuesday , Cameron set out details of the intractable differences after his 45-minute meeting with Hassan Rouhani , the Iranian president , and Obamaâ€ ™ s 90-minute meeting with Vladimir Putin , the Russian president , at the UN general assembly in New York on Monday .
He told CBS : â€œSo far , the problem has been that Russia and Iran have not been able to contemplate the end state of Syria without Assad.â€ �
Cameron confirmed for the first time that he agreed with the US that Bashar al - Assad could be part of a transitional government .
But he said an explicit deal to work with the Syrian president to take on Islamic State would be â€œphoneyâ€ � and self - defeating .
The prime minister said : â€œI know there are people who think IS [ Isis ] is even worse than Assad ,
so shouldnâ€ ™ t we somehow cut a deal with Assad to team up and tackle IS .
It sounds enticing , but even if it were the right thing to do , which it isnâ€ ™ t , it wouldnâ€ ™ t work .
We need a Syria free from IS and Assad .
â€œWhat America said , which I agree with , is that you need a transition .
But what is clear is that at the end of that , Assad can not be the head of Syria .
It wouldnâ€
™ t work.â€ �
Cameron said he would engage in further diplomatic efforts to persuade Russia and Iran that Assad was fuelling terrorism and the rise of Isis with his actions .
He said : â€œIn the end , however far apart we may be with Russia and Iran , those two countries have an influence in what happens in Syria and we need to convince them that a new Syria with a different leader would not necessarily be against their interests , but it would help to get rid of IS.â€
�
Russia had sent troops into Syria to bolster Assad because the president was on the brink of falling , Cameron suggested .
He acknowledged that it was a fair criticism to say the efforts of Britain , the US and other countries to train moderate rebels had been a military failure .
The prime minister said : â€œWe did work to train moderate opposition forces .
We havenâ€ ™ t trained enough , they havenâ€ ™ t been successful enough and they havenâ€
™ t been a big enough presence.â€ � Cameron later repeated his earlier contention that Assad should ultimately face international justice for war crimes .
He said : â€œHe has done appalling things , massacred hundreds of thousands of his own citizens , millions have fled .
In my view , he has broken international law and he has to go.â€ � The prime minister gave the lengthy CBS interview before heading to a UN event about the coalition against Isis , where he told world leaders that the key to defeating the group was to tackle extremist ideology at its roots .
Echoing his previous speeches on extremism , he said freedom of speech did not mean â€œfreedom to hateâ€ � and the world needed to deal with the â€œpoisonousâ€ � ideology of Islamist extremism in schools , prisons and universities .
Cameron is now heading to Jamaica and Grenada on a trade trip , leaving the foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , to give the UKâ€ ™ s main address to the UN general assembly in his place .
Putin has already gone home after attending the assembly for the first time in a decade ."
2015-09-30,"There had been speculation for weeks about whether US president Barack Obama would meet face to face , even briefly , with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani or foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in New York .
On Tuesday , it happened , between Obama and Zarif in the United Nations general assembly building - the first such handshake since the Islamic revolution in 1979 .
Zarif and US secretary of state John Kerry have routinely exchanged such gestures during the months of negotiations that resulted in the joint comprehensive plan of action ( JCPOA ) .
Yet the symbolism of the UN handshake leads many around the world to hope for positive growth in bilateral relations on the heels of the agreement , while critiques of rapprochement grow even more suspicious that both administrations are working together to push through the nuclear deal with little regard to the dissenting voices including those of duly - elected legislators in their respective countries .
If not overtly collaborating , the Obama and Rouhani administrations are working in tandem to push through July ’s nuclear agreement .
The nuclear deal has opponents within Iranian political circles whose concerns are being brushed aside through actions similar to those in the United States .
Even before the JCPOA was signed in Vienna on 14 July , Rouhani , like Obama , claimed executive authority to enter into the plan of action without endorsement from the legislature .
Many Iranian parliamentarians wary of compromise on the nuclear issue quickly rejected , as contrary to law ,
Rouhani ’s claim to absolute authority over foreign policy .
Their stance was sustained by the Guardian Council , twelve Shia jurists empowered by the constitution to oversee the government .
The role of the Iranian parliament , or Majles , in overseeing foreign policy derives from article 125 of the 1979 constitution as amended in 1989 .
The president , or his legal representative , has the authority to sign treaties , protocols , contracts , and agreements with other governments , as well as agreements pertaining to international organisations , after obtaining the approval of the Majles .
Where a dispute arises between the Majles and the president , the Guardian Council is empowered to resolve it .
The council ’s oversight of all aspects of government arises from articles 4 , 72 , and especially 98 of the constitution :
“ The authority of the interpretation of the Constitution is vested with the Guardian Council , which is to be done with the consent of three - fourths of its members .
”
Just as president Obama sent Kerry to testify before the US congress , the Rouhani administration had Mohammad Javad Zarif brief the Majles on the JCPOA .
Aghast at what they heard , deputies established a parliamentary commission , which they had discussed doing when the JCPOA ’s parameters were announced in April .
The agreement was to be reviewed before a debate and vote by the Majles , just as was attempted in the US Congress .
The dispute was referred to the Guardian Council to settle .
On 4 September 2015 , Ali Reza Zakani , who heads the parliamentary commission announced the Guardian Council ’s decision : the constitution requires a parliamentary vote on the agreement .
Many Majles members agree with the “ red lines ” as previously outlined by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , including the immediate lifting of sanctions .
On 3 September , the supreme leader stressed the need for the Majles to have its say , remarking on state television : “ I am not saying lawmakers should ratify or reject it …
I have told the president that it is not in our interest to not let lawmakers review the deal .
”
Also siding with those in the Majles opposing the deal , Saeed Jalili , a former lead negotiator during the process that eventually led to the JCPOA , told the special parliamentary commission that the accord was a setback for Iran ’s sovereignty and advancement with the Rouhani administration conceding “ approximately 100 absolute rights ” by “ accepting unconventional [ inspection ] measures
” .
However , the Rouhani administration would never have signed the JCPOA without Khamenei ’s acquiescence .
So , not surprisingly , the leader ’s senior foreign policy adviser Ali Akbar Velayati publicly dismissed Jalili ’s assessment as personal “ interpretation ” rather than professional judgment - despite Jalili ’s diplomatic experience and current post on Iran ’s Supreme National Security Council .
Just as Obama and his officials are tarring the opponents of the JCPOA as people with a war mindset , the Rouhani administration has turned to its own appointees to quash opposing analyses of the agreement .
On 8 September , as the rhetoric heated up , Ali Akbar Salehi , who heads the Atomic Energy Organisation , slammed the deal ’s domestic naysayers as “ unfairly ” spreading “ wrong information ” to generate “ political conflict ” rather than uniting behind it for “ national interests ” .
The actions by both chief executives to thwart critics’ views from becoming mainstream is not surprising .
After all , Obama and Rouhani were elected with a mandate to seek to end conflicts through negotiations , but both have gone to unusual lengths to stifle critical appraisal of a major decision in foreign policy .
In Iran , as in the US , foreign policy decisions are often made within the executive branch .
And as in the US , the JCPOA is being summarily presented in Iran as a multilateral deal based on the United Nations rather than a bilateral treaty requiring legislative approval .
Opponents of the JCPOA in the US and Iran focus on their two nations as the major players in the deal , and the plan of action would indeed collapse without the US lifting its unilateral sanctions or Iran fulfilling its terms to US satisfaction .
Many politicians and experts in the US do not regard the UN ’s International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , which will oversee verification of Iran ’s compliance , as up to the challenge either technically or politically .
Their counterparts in Iran regard the IAEA as a tool of the west , spying on Iran and exposing Iranian scientists to danger .
Hence members of the US Congress and the Majles expect to be fully involved in the processes of accepting and implementing the JCPOA .
But supporters of the agreement emphasise their chief executives’ authority in foreign policy as well as the singular importance of this deal , and claim that overarching domestic and international interests trump reservations over sovereignty and verification .
In each country , those favouring the agreement have called for legislators , judges , and military officers to stand behind their president and nuclear negotiators .
Sadegh Larijani , the chief justice and an appointee of Khamenei , fell into line when the JCPOA ’s initial parameters were announced in April , instructing other judges that the upcoming pact “ firmly adheres to the framework drawn by the leader for protecting [ Iran ’s ] nuclear rights
” .
So too did another of the supreme leader ’s men , major general Mohammad Ali Jafari , commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps .
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , chair of the Expediency Council , which mediates disputes between the branches of government , also enlisted in favour of the JCPOA .
The former president characterised it as “ more important than the [ end of the Iran - Iraq ] War ” .
Rafsanjani ’s endorsement was especially important because as Majles speaker in 1988 he set the stage for developing a nuclear programme that would put Iran within reach of a weapon .
All these manoeuvrings within Tehran ’s political circles , as in Washington , permit dissatisfaction over the JCPOA to be aired while preordaining that the country conducts foreign policy by executive mandate .
Yes , Rouhani is doing what he said he ’d do if elected Iran ’s president : but in the process he is not permitting parliamentarians to be active and is compromising the democratic process he promised to enhance .
Iran ’s special parliamentary commission expects to present its report or reports by 2 October on the JCPOA .
There is dissention and competing conclusions among the commissions as among US Congress members .
But neither President Rouhani ’s office nor that of Majles speaker Ali Larijani has prepared a bill for legislators to amend the JCPOA or to vote it up or down .
The Majles has concluded that the necessary legislation must be sent to the parliament rather than written by its members , though they may write a bill as a last resort .
Without legislation being tendered , even if a majority of Iranian lawmakers end up passing a nonbinding resolution of approval or disapproval , their action would largely be symbolic .
Consequently even prominent members of the Majles , previously dubious of the JCPOA , are beginning to yield .
On 22 September , Alaeddin Boroujerdi , who chairs the parliamentary national security and foreign policy commission , has urged fellow legislators not just to vote in favour of the deal but to pass a resolution requiring the Rouhani administration to implement it .
One day later , parliamentarian Hossein Naghavi Hosseini , who serves as the commission ’s spokesman , indicated its report would recommend the Majles adopt a resolution of provisional approval valid as long as the JCPOA did not violate Khamenei ’s redlines .
Perhaps the JCPOA is the best deal possible in security terms , as both presidents Obama and Rouhani claim .
But elected lawmakers are entitled to be meaningfully involved in the deal - making and , if necessary , the deal - reshaping processes .
Representational governance should not fall by the wayside for the sake of purported national and global interests , neither in the US nor in Iran .
It would calm some of the naysayers fears and win over others still ambiguous about the JCPOA , if both the Obama and Rouhani administrations fully heed due process on their paths to adopting and implementing the nuclear deal .

2015-10-01,"The Iranian government has been far more effective than the American administration in galvanising public opinion in support of the nuclear agreement .
According to a recent survey by IranPoll.com , a Toronto - based polling company , for the University of Maryland , three in four Iranians support the nuclear agreement and give high marks to Iranâ€ ™ s President Hassan Rouhani for making it happen .
The deal has helped Rouhani consolidate his political standing , with 89 % of Iranians expressing favourable attitudes toward him and 60 % saying they want the presidentâ€ ™ s allies and supporters to win control of parliament in elections due in February .
Much of this support , however , appears to rest on misperceptions about Iranâ€ ™ s commitments under the agreement and on unrealistic expectations about its likely economic benefits .
A majority ( 56 % ) incorrectly believe Iran has not agreed to limit its nuclear research and development activities .
Sixty - one percent incorrectly believe there are no conditions under which the International Atomic Energy Agency is permitted to inspect Iranian military sites .
A majority ( 59 % ) are also under the false impression that the agreement means all US sanctions , even those unrelated to Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme , will be eventually lifted .
While slightly more than half of those who donâ€ ™ t hold these misperceptions also approve of the deal , the situation may make Rouhani vulnerable as Iranians become more informed about Iranâ€ ™ s commitments under the nuclear agreement .
His future standing is likely to be determined by how he balances a short - term response to high public expectations and a determination to uses his popularity to push for painful economic reforms .
It is only natural for Rouhani to be tempted to use the windfalls of the nuclear agreement - unfrozen overseas assets , higher oil sales , and higher foreign investment - to produce short - term tangible improvements in peopleâ€ ™ s lives .
Considering that 63 % of Iranians have come to believe that the nuclear agreement will create significant improvements in their standard of living in a year or less , Rouhani may feel his political future depends on quick results .
This is exactly the trap previous president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad fell into when oil prices skyrocketed in 2008 .
Instead of using the extra oil revenue to tackle Iranâ€ ™ s underlying economic ills , Ahmadinejad decided to provide cash handouts to all Iranian citizens .
While these were intended to ease the phasing out of subsidies of everyday items including bread and energy , far more was paid out than was saved by removing some subsidies .
According to an IMF study , the balance between handouts and savings over subsidies produced an annual fiscal deficit equivalent to 1.6 - 1.8 % of GDP in the three years beginning in the Iranian year 2010 - 11 .
The handouts initially boosted Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s popularity , but they triggered one of Iranâ€ ™ s worst ever episodes of hyperinflation and currency depreciation , resulting in a decrease in peopleâ€ ™ s purchasing power .
Rouhani is now at a similar juncture and â€ “ amid much lower oil prices â€ “ must decide between pandering to peopleâ€ ™ s short - term expectations or tackling Iranâ€ ™ s more fundamental economic challenges .
Iranâ€ ™ s economy will continue to suffer from a range of endemic problems even after sanctions are lifted .
These include a large inefficient public sector , an underperforming private sector , widespread corruption , burdensome bureaucracies , over - dependence on oil revenue and costly subsidies .
These factors have significantly diminished Iranâ€ ™ s competitive edge , leaving Iranâ€ ™ s business environment ranked 130 out of 189 countries in the World Bankâ€ ™ s 2015 Doing Business Report .
Without bold and often painful structural reforms , the impact of sanctions relief will probably be negligible and any benefit to peopleâ€ ™ s livelihoods short - lived .
Instead of focusing on peopleâ€ ™ s short - term expectations , Rouhani should channel funds and investment into competitive and export - oriented industries including oil , gas and petrochemicals .
Investment is also needed to overhaul the infrastructure and retrain employees to move out of inefficient industries .
Tourism , education , and health all need higher funding as well .
While all previous Iranian presidents have tried to reform Iranâ€ ™ s economy , none had the competence , capacity to extract resources from the population , and favourable circumstances needed to enact and sustain economic reforms .
Rouhani may have all these .
He has already established credibility by fulfilling his most important campaign promise to have sanctions lifted without abandoning the nuclear programme , and he can use this political capital to lead Iran out of its deep - rooted economic woes .

2015-10-01,"More than 50 current presidents , prime ministers and monarchs were educated at UK universities , but Britain risks losing international influence if its punitive student visa policy shuts out future leaders , a thinktank has said .
The Higher Education Policy Institute said 55 serving world leaders from 51 countries â€ “ ranging from Antigua to Yemen â€ “ attended British higher education institutions , with Manchester , Oxford and the Royal military academy at Sandhurst among the most popular .
Commonwealth countries are well represented on the list
â€ “ Australiaâ€ ™ s
new prime minister , Malcolm Turnbull , attended Oxford university â€ “ while other leaders include Iraqâ€ ™ s prime minister Haider al - Abadi ( Manchester ) , Iranâ€ ™ s
president Hassan Rouhani ( Glasgow Caledonian ) and Beninâ€ ™ s prime minister Lionel Zinsou ( LSE ) .
â€œWe punch above our weight internationally partly because of the soft power benefits that arise from educating the worldâ€ ™ s leaders .
It is staggering that 55 world leaders should have studied in a country of the UKâ€ ™ s size , yet we benefit enormously from the fact that they did , â€ � said Nick Hillman , HEPIâ€ ™ s director .
But Hillman , a former special adviser on higher education at the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , said tightened visa restrictions on overseas students would hurt the UKâ€ ™ s influence in the future .
â€œThe Home Office wants to restrict the number of foreigners coming to study here while other parts of government recognise the economic benefits .
It is a straight fight pitching security against economics .
Thatâ€ ™ s a tragedy because all sorts of other advantages are being ignored , â€ � Hillman said .
Manchester University topped the list having educated 10 world leaders as either undergraduates or postgraduates , Oxford nine , Sandhurst and Londonâ€ ™ s colleges
seven apiece , Cambridge four , and LSE three , including Colombiaâ€ ™ s president Juan Manuel Santos .
Politics - based courses such as international relations were , fittingly , the most popular among the future national leaders , followed by military training and law courses .
The list includes only two women , although the pair are poles apart .
One is Queen Margrethe II of Denmark , who studied archaeology at Girton College in the 1960s , Cambridge , while the other is Atifete Jahjaga , the president of Kosovo who studied police management as a postgraduate at Leicester University in 2007 .
A noteable absence from the list is Britainâ€ ™ s own head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , who did not attend university and received no formal education , being home - schooled .
The remnants of Europeâ€ ™ s aristocracy are also represented by two Sandhurst graduates , Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg and Crown Prince Alois of Liechtenstein .
Sandhurst also educated Ian Khama , president of Botswana , as well as the Sultan of Brunei .
The total of 55 leaders does not include the three British - educated leaders of disputed states such as Palestine , or those such as Rwandaâ€ ™ s president , Paul Kagame , who gained a business studies qualification through distance learning .
A few countries have both serving head of state and head of government as British university alumni , including Mozambiqueâ€ ™ s president , Filipe Nyusi ( Manchester ) , and the prime minister , Carlos Agostinho do RosÃ¡rio ( Imperial College London ) .
The list suggests soft power has its limitations in foreign policy .
Syriaâ€ ™ s
Bashar al - Assad studied ophthalmology at a teaching hospital now part of Imperial College healthcare trust in London .
The UK recruits more overseas students than any country other than the US , and they comprise a sixth of the total UK student body .
But in recent years the UKâ€ ™ s growth in numbers has fallen behind many of its international rivals .
The number of overseas students coming to the UK grew by 2 % in 2013 - 14 , while Germanyâ€ ™ s higher education sector grew nearly 7 % in the same period .
Of most concern is the sharp fall in the number of students from India , which halved from 39,000 in 2010 - 11 to 19,000 in 2013 - 14 .
Louise Richardson , vice - chancellor of St Andrews University , who takes over at Oxford next year , told the Times Higher Education Supplement that Britain would be â€œimpoverished if students from other countries find it too costly , too difficult or too unwelcoming to travel to the UK to attend our universitiesâ€ � .
Richardson said the UK should do more to keep talented overseas students .
â€œRather than insisting that foreigners educated here leave on graduation , we should be providing incentives for them to stay and to commit their education and energy to the British economy.â€
�
A spokesman for BIS said : â€œGovernment recognises the contribution that international students make to the UKâ€ ™ s economy and higher education system , which remains the second most popular destination for international students after the US .
The UK welcomes genuine international students .
There is no cap on the number of international students that can study in the UK.â€ �"
2015-10-12,"Jason Rezaian , the Washington Post journalist whose conviction on espionage charges was announced this weekend , has been detained longer than any other western journalist in Iran , possibly an unwitting pawn in a struggle between doves and hawks in the Islamic republic .
The 39-year - old , who holds dual Iranian and US citizenship , was arrested at his home in Tehran in July 2014 along with his wife , Yeganeh Salehi , also a journalist , and two friends , an Iranian - American couple .
The two friends , who are believed to have close ties to the family of the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , were released shortly after their arrest .
Salehi was released on bail in October and is facing a separate trial .
Rezaian was held on unspecified charges for more than seven months before appearing in court .
He was kept sequestered for most of his time in jail with little access to his lawyers and family .
In March , he was granted access to a lawyer , though not the one his family chose to represent him .
His trial started in May when he appeared before a hardline judge behind closed doors on charges of espionage , collecting confidential information and spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic .
The judge has yet to pronounce a sentence , but the reporter , who has worked in Iran since 2008 and has been the Postâ€ ™ s properly accredited bureau chief in Tehran since 2012 , could face up to 20 years now that he has been found guilty .
The Washington Postâ€ ™ s editor , Martin Baron , called the guilty verdict â€œan outrageous injusticeâ€ � and â€œcontemptibleâ€ � .
â€œIran has behaved unconscionably throughout this case , but never more so than with this indefensible decision by a Revolutionary Court to convict an innocent journalist of serious crimes after a proceeding that unfolded in secret , with no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing , â€ � he said in a statement .
Iran does not recognise dual citizenship and treated Rezaian as solely Iranian .
The countryâ€ ™ s intelligence authorities have a deep suspicion of dual citizens and have arrested a number in recent years .
Iran also has a history of jailing journalists working for the foreign press .
Those previously jailed include Maziar Bahari , whose ordeal was the subject of Rosewater , a 2014 film by US comedian Jon Stewart .
Rezaianâ€ ™ s
mother , Mary , was in Tehran during the trial but was not allowed to attend .
Reporters Without Borders , or Reporters sans FrontiÃ¨res ( RSF ) said this year that it was
â€œno
coincidenceâ€ � Rezaian was jailed at the time when Iranâ€ ™ s moderate forces were trying to reach a nuclear accord with the west amid opposition from hardliners at home .
Rezaianâ€ ™ s brother Ali , who met with Barack Obama in April to press his brotherâ€ ™ s case , has repeatedly criticised the decision by the Iranian judiciary to hold the trial behind closed doors and has said his brother lost 18 kg ( 40 lb ) while in jail .
Iran has yet to explain the espionage charges .
Ali Rezaian said two pieces of evidence against his brother were a visa application he had lodged for Salehi to travel to the US , and a letter he sent to Obamaâ€ ™ s 2008 White House transition team offering help to improve bilateral relations between Iran and the US .
The Washington Post has repeatedly accused Iran of imposing â€œKafkaesque restrictionsâ€ � on his case , which was presided over by Abolghassem Salavati , a judge notorious for issuing heavy sentences .
Local and foreign media were denied access to the trial .
Martin Baron , the Postâ€ ™ s executive editor , condemned the detention and trial as â€œshameful acts of injusticeâ€ � and said â€œthere is no justice in this system , not an ounce of itâ€ � .
Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister , who described Rezaian as a fair reporter , said Rezaian was accused of â€œa very serious offenceâ€ �
but that he hoped he would be cleared of the charges against him .
Zarif said in April : â€œHe is an Iranian citizen .
It is unfortunate that some over - zealous , low - level operative tried to take advantage of him .
And I donâ€ ™ t go into further detail because itâ€ ™ s a pending case before the court .
And I hope that he will be cleared of that charge.â€ � While in jail , Rezaian was attacked by Iranâ€ ™ s hardline media , which tried to build a cause against him .
Unattributed sources alleged he worked as a spy while reporting in the country for the Post .
A Fars news agency report alleged that Rezaian provided economic and industrial data to the US government .
Many analysts believe Rezaian was caught up in a high - level feud between Rouhaniâ€ ™ s administration and its internal opponents .
RSF said the case was being used in an Iranian power struggle .
Rezaian had been working in Iran with appropriate accreditation .
His prolonged detention brought much embarrassment for Rouhani , whose administration is seeking to improve relations with the west , especialy after the landmark nuclear agreement struck in July .
After his election victory in 2013 , the Post was the first international newspaper to which Rouhani turned to publish his opinion piece in which he set out his global vision .
Nevertheless , he remained largely quiet in defence of Rezaian , whose detention has been widely condemned internationally .
Iranâ€ ™ s conservative - dominated judiciary , which had full control over Rezaianâ€ ™ s case , acts independently of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government .
But the president can use his position as the public face of the Islamic republic to defend those in prison unjustly .
Rouhani is loathed by hardliners because of his efforts to create greater social freedoms at home and engage with the international community .
They believe his administration gave away too much for too little in the nuclear negotiations .
There are at least two other Americans in jail in Iran , including pastor Saeed Abedini and former US marine Amir Hekmati , who has been held since 2011 .
Profile : Jason Rezaian Jason Rezaian was born in Marin County , California , three years before the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran .
His mother , Mary , is American and his late father , Taghi , was an Iranian who had emigrated to the US two decades before the reporterâ€ ™ s birth .
He attended college in New York and later got involved in his fatherâ€ ™ s carpet - selling business before pursuing a career in journalism .
He wrote for a number of US publications , including a regular Iran column for the San Francisco Chronicle .
His interest in his fatherâ€ ™ s homeland led him to apply for an Iranian passport and move to Tehran in 2008 .
According to his family , Rezaian was particularly intent in showing a better image of Iran worldwide , especially to his fellow Americans .
â€œHe wanted people to know that Iranians have the same aspirations and hopes and dreams for their families that people all around the west and everywhere else do , and to get rid of this one - dimensional view of Iran , â€ � his brother Ali has said .
Rezaian was an accredited journalist by Iranâ€ ™ s ministry of culture and Islamic guidance and had permission to operate in Iran .
He was always careful not to cross red lines , his family said , and his last article before arrest was about baseball in Iran .
He had travelled to Vienna to cover the Iranian nuclear negotiations several months before that .
He joined the Washington Post in 2012 as its Tehran correspondent .
A year later , he married the Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi , who wrote for the UAE - based National newspaper ."
2015-10-13,"Iranâ€ ™ s conservative - dominated parliament has endorsed the landmark nuclear agreement struck earlier this year , clearing the last hurdle before both sides begin work to implement it next week .
The Iranian parliament , the Majlis , on Tuesday passed a motion to approve the nuclear deal after heated discussions and sharp exchanges between MPs and the moderate administration of Hassan Rouhani , whose credibility was on the line had parliamentarians voted down the accord .
It passed with 161 yes votes , 59 no votes and 13 abstentions among the 250 MPs present at the session .
Under the agreement , Iran is expected to start work on rolling back its nuclear programme from 18 October â€ “ labelled as adoption day â€ “ which includes taking out thousands of centrifuges at its enrichment facilities and pulling out its heavy - water reactor and filling it with concrete .
The EU will in return adopt a regulation for the lifting of sanctions and the US president , Barack Obama , will issue waivers for sanctions relief .
However , these measures will not take effect until what has become known as implementation day , when the UN nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , will verify that Tehran has taken the necessary steps as outlined under the deal .
It is not clear when implementation day will be but
Rouhani , anxious to bring the economic benefits of the agreement to his country at the soonest opportunity , said on the sidelines of the UN general assembly last month that his country hoped that date would be early next year .
Sceptics say it might take a few months longer .
Rouhani came to power in 2013 promising greater transparency over Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme and vowed to bring what he repeatedly described as a cruel sanctions regime to an end .
If Tehran and its negotiating partners , the P5 + 1 group ( US , UK , France , Germany , China and Russia ) implement the agreement fully , it will be a huge victory for both sides in resolving one of the worldâ€ ™ s most complicated crises peacefully and through diplomatic means .
Rouhani will also receive a boost at home .
His opponents , who have accused his administration of appeasing the west , the US ( or â€œGreat Satanâ€ � ) in particular , will be weakened and the path would be prepared for the moderate cleric to bring about social reforms , his other big election promise .
Internally , many hope that with the nuclear file closing , Rouhani would shift his attention to the issue of human rights in the country .
Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has the final say in all state matters , including the countryâ€ ™ s nuclear activities .
He has yet to voice disapproval , but neither has he endorsed the nuclear accord sealed in Vienna in July .
However , the political structure of the Islamic republic is such that Iranian diplomats would not have agreed to the deal without his consent .
Without Khameneiâ€ ™ s clear backing of the deal , a large number of MPs were vocal in criticising Rouhani over the agreement but the supreme leader had made it clear that the Majlis should have a say on the accord .
The parliamentâ€ ™ s approval on the agreement , known as the joint comprehensive plan of action ( JCPOA ) , came after several public and private sessions at which MPs challenged negotiators on the details of the agreements , occasionally line by line .
Under the agreement , Tehran also needs to ship out the vast majority of its enriched uranium stockpile to a third country and take out two - thirds of its centrifuges at the Fordow facility , which is deep underground .
When the IAEA gives the green light on implementation day , past nuclear - related UN resolutions against Iran will be terminated .
On the same day , the EUâ€ ™ s lifting of its oil embargo and financial , banking and transportation sanctions will also come into force .
But some non - nuclear - related US sanctions on Iran will remain in place , which might make doing business with Iran complicated for some international firms .
Although sanctions have not yet been lifted , an unprecedented number of foreign delegations are visiting Tehran every week as they consider returning to doing business in Iran .
A 30-member group from some 15 UK companies visited the country last week but the chancellor , George Osborne , plans to take UKâ€ ™ s largest delegation to Iran early next year ."
2015-10-21,"Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has given his qualified approval to the nuclear accord agreed with major powers , but added conditions that could complicate its implementation .
In a letter to President Hassan Rouhani , Khamenei said Iran would not take major steps to dismantle its nuclear programme until the UN nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , closed an investigation into the countryâ€ ™ s alleged past work on the design of nuclear weapons .
The intervention is problematic for Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government , which is in a hurry to implement the nuclear deal so that Iran can benefit from sanctions relief before legislative elections in late February .
On Wednesday , it announced that it was close to a deal with Russia to export its stockpile of enriched uranium in return for imports of natural uranium .
Khamenei also stipulated that sanctions , or even the threat of sanctions , from abroad could be grounds for walking away from the deal , known as the joint comprehensive plan of action ( JCPOA ) .
â€œAny comments suggesting the sanctions structure will remain in place or [ new ] sanctions will be imposed , at any level and under any pretext , would be a violation of the JCPOA , â€ � the letter , published on Khameneiâ€ ™ s official website , said .
The JCPOA was agreed by Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government with the US and five other world powers , including the UK , in Vienna in July .
It has since been endorsed by the Iranian parliament , the Majlis , but the supreme leader has the final say .
The caveats he placed on his approval make the deal even more fragile and could postpone its implementation .
The US has recently declared that Iran has continued to violate UN resolutions with its test of ballistic missiles , and the Republican majority in Congress has threatened to slap further sanctions on Iran .
Khameneiâ€ ™ s letter increases the odds that such threats could torpedo the nuclear deal .
The IAEA is due to deliver its report on suspected past nuclear weapons work on 15 December .
Khameneiâ€ ™ s letter says Iran should wait until then before carrying out two key time - consuming steps agreed under the JCPOA â€ “ exporting its stock of enriched uranium and removing the core from a heavy - water reactor .
This could substantially postpone the implementation of the deal , which Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government had wanted finished by the end of the year .
The head of Iranâ€ ™ s Atomic Energy Organisation , Ali Akbar Salehi , said an Iranian delegation was in Moscow negotiating a uranium exchange deal by which Iran would fulfil its JCPOA obligation to reduce its stock of low - enriched uranium by more than 90 % to 300 kg .
â€œWe have about nine metric tonnes of enriched uranium , and we opted to sell this amount in global markets in choosing from two options of diluting it or selling ; this is a strong advantage of JCPOA for Iran , â€ � Salehi said , according to the IRNA news agency .
He estimated the exchange could be carried out in two months .
Ali Vaez , an expert on Iran at the International Crisis Group , said Khameneiâ€ ™ s conditions , particularly on sanctions , could undermine the JCPOA agreement .
â€œExpecting the US to unilaterally give up on a tool of statecraft that it has used to contain what it sees as unconstructive Iranian regional policies is unrealistic , â€ �
Vaez said .
â€œPredetermining Iranâ€ ™ s response to potential sabotage by hardliners in Washington doesnâ€
™ t deter them .
In fact , it puts their hand on the trigger while diminishing Iranâ€ ™ s manoeuvring room.â€ �"
2015-11-12,"Iranâ€ ™ s re - entry into the diplomatic mainstream might be thoroughly welcome , but it is not without its hitches .
Just as President Hassan Rouhani was preparing for a trip to Europe that will start in Italy and continue , via the Vatican , to France , his Paris stay risked being soured in advance by differences over â€ ¦ food and drink .
The French were reportedly offering lunch with President FranÃ§ois Hollande .
But the Iranians insisted that the food should be halal and the drinks only soft â€ “ which , of course , for the French , made it a travesty of dÃ © jeuner .
Such a meal might also have given Marine le Pen some political bonus points if she had learned of the menu .
So lunch is off , and breakfast was apparently rejected as a cheap and unworthy alternative â€ “ which in France , where breakfast means coffee and croissant , it surely would have been .
Breakfast in Britain , on the other hand , might indeed make an acceptable option â€ “ if , that is , â€œfull Englishâ€ � qualifies as such without the bacon .
Anyway , it now seems that whatever deals may be done in Paris , they will not be celebrated with either food or toasts .
It is not clear what awaits Iranâ€ ™ s president in Rome â€ “ though the diplomatic style may be less rigid here
â€ “ let alone at the Vatican .
Then again , the predilection of Pope Francis for the simple life could make things easier : who could object to a plain plate of fresh bread and fruit , washed down with nothing more intoxicating than sparkling water ?
The pitfalls of diplomatic dining are legion .
No British ambassadorâ€ ™
s memoirs are complete without at least one stomach - churning account of â€œeating for Britainâ€ � , after unmentionable â€ “ but all too obvious â€ “ animal parts have been brought to the feast with great ceremony .
Refusal , even hesitation , both sides understand , risks a slight that will poison relations for years .
Ox eyes , bullâ€ ™ s testicles , large insects â€ “ deep fried , or perhaps honeyed â€ “ might all be proffered .
Close your eyes , say Their Excellencies , and think loyally of Queen , country and career .
If you have ever wondered why diplomatic dining in much of the developed world tends to the bland and , frankly , boring , ask yourself what remains after the cautious host has stripped out all meat from pigs and cows , all shellfish , most cheese ( the Chinese tend to find it repellent ) and anything too spicy .
That is why you are looking at a plate of barely dressed salad , followed by some white fish or chicken ( not always distinguishable from each other ) , rounded off with something fruity or chocolatey .
A party piece of buffets at the British embassy in Paris used to be â€ “ and may still be â€ “ some elaborate sandwich confection resembling a loaf of bread with the crusts cut off .
I never quite understood the point of it , other than perhaps to show that the British could do complicated culinary architecture , too .
It is not only the food that causes furrowed brows .
At some British embassies , I was told , it was the job of the most junior diplomat to arrange the seating plan for formal dinners .
On the face of it , this might seem a simple task : rank is taken seriously , so there is your first principle .
You must also ensure that the ( few ) women are not seated together .
Thereafter , it becomes much , much more difficult .
Are there guests whose countries are not really on speaking terms ?
Do you want to encourage dialogue or risk war ?
Are you absolutely certain that those you have seated beside each other have at least one language in common ?
And how do you stop guests sneaking a look at the table plan and switching the nameplates around ( oh yes , they do ) ?
In conclusion , I offer this piquant anecdote , courtesy of a late journalist colleague who was also a former diplomat .
We are talking the late 1970s and a visit to London by Indiaâ€ ™ s
then prime minister , Moraji Desai â€ “ and ,
by quoting it , I mean no disrespect to Narendra Modi , who arrives in the UK today .
Desai was renowned for his Gandhi - esque ascetism , which included , so it was said , the supposedly health - giving practice of drinking his own urine .
Guests had arrived for the official dinner .
As everyone sat down , a solitary waiter walked slowly in , bearing a single glass of yellowish liquid on a tray .
The hall fell silent ; horrified eyes followed the progress of the glass to the head of the table .
Glances were exchanged .
The contents , as was later clarified , were nothing more health - giving than apple juice ."
2015-11-14,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , is embarking on a major European visit , the first such trip in more than a decade , in order to reintroduce Iran into a continent that was the countryâ€ ™ s largest trading partner before sanctions .
Bolstered by the landmark Iranian nuclear agreement , the moderate cleric is due in Rome on Saturday and Paris next week on consecutive official visits he hopes will revive Iranâ€ ™ s global image and rebuild economic ties .
The trip comes a few months after Tehran agreed to roll back its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions , including an end to the EU embargo on imports of Iranian oil .
It will be Rouhaniâ€ ™ s first official visit to Europe and also the first to the continent by an Iranian head of government since 1999 when the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , made similar trips to Paris and Rome .
Iran - EU ties reached a nadir under the ex - president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
In Rome , Rouhani is expected to meet the Italian prime minister , Matteo Renzi , and Pope Francis , who advocated a peaceful resolution to the crisis over the Iranian nuclear programme and recently urged US Congress not to sabotage the Vienna nuclear accord .
Rouhaniâ€ ™
s visits are particularly important because he is facing increasing resistance at home by hardliners not to open up to the west .
At international level , Tehran is under pressure to play a constructive role , especially in talks over Syria .
Ahead of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s visit , Iranâ€ ™ s hardline judiciary arrested a number of journalists and businessmen .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , warned against â€œan infiltrationâ€ � into the countryâ€ ™ s political system from outside , a signal that he doesnâ€ ™ t want Tehran to be seen as appeasing the west in the light of the agreement .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s internal opponents have since capitalised on Khameneiâ€
™ s
talk of infiltration in order to denounce the president .
While in France , Rouhani will aim to present his country as a key regional player with an influential role in determining the fate of Syria , according to Ali - Akbar Mousavi Khoini , a former reformist Iranian MP .
After years of operating a de facto boycott of Iran at the Syria talks , Tehran has recently been participating at such events .
â€œIran was previously seen as part of the problem in Syria and has just recently been accepted as a country that can play a role in finding a solution to the conflict , â€ � Mousavi Khoini said .
â€œI hope that Europe , France in particular , would listen to what Iran has to say about Syria .
France can play an intermediary role between Iran , which has great influence in Syria , and the west .
I think Tehran can play a more positive role in Syria now that it has been finally recognised as a stakeholder.â€ �
The French president , FranÃ§ois Hollande , will welcome Rouhani at the ElysÃ
© e palace on Tuesday .
But , according to French media reports , a state lunch reception was cancelled because of Iranâ€ ™ s insistence on a longstanding diplomatic protocol that its officials should not participate at events where wine is served .
Rouhaniâ€ ™
s visits will be watched closely by European business leaders keen to sell their products in a country of 80 million people and the second largest country in the Middle East .
An unprecedented number of European delegations have already rushed to Iran on fact - finding missions even before sanctions are lifted .
Rouzbeh Pirouz , the chairman of Tehran - based Turquoise Partners Group , sees huge potential in the country .
â€œIran is one of the last great untapped emerging markets in the world ; it has 80 million people and a huge consumer market with a switched - on population ; everyone has smartphones and they know whatâ€ ™ s going on .
They are very tech - savvy and consumer - oriented , â€ � he said .
French car companies , especially Peugeot and Renault , are eager to return to business in Iran .
Peugeot used to sell 400,000 vehicles a year in Iran prior to international sanctions when an arrangement with local manufacturer Iran Khodro , which assembled the vehicles , meant its cars were ubiquitous across the country .
It had to dramatically decrease its operation in Iran because of sanctions three years ago but is now setting its sights on expansion in the country after the lifting of sanctions and looking for partners to build cars locally .
Some continental European companies have been active in pursuing business in Iran and some have even opened offices in Tehran and begun to hire staff .
Alstom , the French electricity generation and rail transport firm , is seeking contracts to work on expansion of the metro in Tehran and building two more lines in the city of Mashhad and participate in the electrification of the 600-mile ( 1,000 km ) Tehran - Mashhad railway .
The French industrial group Bouygues and AÃ © roports
de Paris are in talks with Iran to construct the countryâ€ ™ s largest transport project , the second terminal at Tehranâ€ ™ s Imam Khomeini international airport .
Although the EU lifted Iranian sanctions in October , the measures will only come into effect after what has become known as â€œimplementation
dayâ€ � , the unknown date when the UN nuclear watchdog will verify that Iran has taken the necessary steps as outlined under the nuclear deal .
Iran is expediting whatever it can to bring this date forward to as early as January
but sceptics say it might take a few months longer ."
2015-11-19,"The attacks in Paris may have postponed Hassan Rouhaniâ€ ™ s highly - anticipated visit to the Ã‰lysÃ © e Palace , which was scheduled for this week , but the Iranian president will soon travel to France with a better bargaining position over Syria .
Iran , an ally of Bashar al - Assadâ€ ™ s regime since the conflict started in 2011 , has been arguing that the west should prioritise the fight against Islamic State ( Isis ) and step aside from the position that the Syrian leader , considered by them to be a part of the problem , must leave .
Critics say Tehran is trying to shield Assad behind a bigger evil and is doing whatever it can to protect its strategic ally while many others believe that the invasion of Iraq and the oustings of Saddam Hussein , and more recently Muammar Gaddafi in Libya , are signs that power vacuums in such a volatile region have proved to be a major challenge .
Ali Alfoneh , senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies , said : â€œPresident FranÃ§ois Hollande , who can not count on Washington deploying ground forces in Syria , is now reaching out to Iran and Russia to form an alliance in the fight against Daesh [ Isis ] .
â€œThis in turn legitimises Iranâ€ ™ s military engagement in Syria , which Washington considers as one of the root causes of emergence of Daesh in that country .
In that sense , the terrorist attacks in Paris came as manna from heaven for Tehran.â€ � The Franco - Iranian alliance is likely to prove fragile , Alfoneh argued , because Paris and Tehran pursue opposing goals .
â€œWhile Paris is committed to annihilation of Daesh , survival of the Assad regime is Tehranâ€ ™ s goal , â€ �
he said .
In Syria , some analysts say , Tehran is itself prioritising the fight against the Syrian opposition over the fight against Isis .
â€œTo this end , Tehran keeps alive Daesh as a useful enemy , which not only makes Bashar al - Assad appear as the lesser evil , but also legitimises Iranâ€ ™ s military intervention in Syria and provides president Rouhani with access to European capitals as a key player in the conflict.â€ �
Mohammad Marandi , a Tehran University professor who is close to senior officials at the Iranian establishment , disagrees with Alfoneh over Iranian motives .
He blames the US and its European allies for the deteriorating situation in Syria and the rise of Isis but said the west could find a suitable partner in Tehran if it â€œcorrectedâ€ � its policy in the Middle East .
â€œThe issue is that Iran has been predicting that this would happen for five years , â€ �
Marandi told the Guardian .
â€œFrom the very start of the Syrian crisis , Iranians have been saying that the militants are being funded by the Wahabi regimes , and that they are extremist in nature and this will lead to blowback.â€ �
The Wahabi regimes is the Shia Iranâ€ ™ s terminology in reference to Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab regional allies .
â€œIran believes that the bigger evil has been coalition between the western governments and Wahabis dictatorships in the Persian Gulf and Turkey and Israel , â€ �
Marandi said .
â€œThis was the great evil , otherwise the unrest in Syria and even the casualties were far less than that which we saw in Egypt , for example .
Iran believes that the Americans and the Europeans chose allies that ultimately fed this extremism not only in Syria , but also in Libya and in Yemen and as a result we are seeing the whole region moving towards destabilisation.â€ �
Rouhani was due in Paris this week on a major European trip , the first such visit to the continent by an Iranian president in more than a decade .
It has been postponed .
The Iranian president , bolstered by the landmark nuclear agreement in July , particularly wanted to present his country as a key regional player with an influential role in determining the fate of Syria and the fight against Isis , a common enemy .
Rouhani told Hollande in a phone conversation after the attacks that Tehran was prepared to cooperate with France in security and intelligence matters to fight terrorism .
The Paris attacks are likely to strengthen Rouhaniâ€ ™ s bargaining position over Syria when he ultimately travels to Paris but it is not clear if the dynamics will change in practice .
Iran was previously rejected by the west as a major stakeholder in Syria but following the nuclear accord , that perception seems to have changed , with Tehran now sitting at high - level Syria talks in Vienna for the first time .
Iran has invested heavily in protecting Syriaâ€ ™ s Assad , dispatching some of its most experienced Revolutionary Guard commanders to the country to plan and oversee operations and moreso recruiting its Afghan refugees to be sent to the conflict for combat purposes .
The rising number of funerals in Iran for senior Iranian commanders killed in Syria in recent months is a tangible sign of a greater involvement in the Syrian conflict after the Russian airstrikes .
Dina Esfandiary , a MacArthur fellow at Kingâ€ ™ s College London , said : â€œI think Iran might think that the Paris attacks give it an upper hand over Syria because naturally it gives a little bit more credibility to the rhetoric that combating Isis is more important than combating Assad .
â€œIran will think that its position will be strengthened as the result of the attack but I am not sure it necessarily will .
The only thing that the Paris attacks will really change is rhetoric in the west but Iâ€ ™ m not sure if it changes much on the ground .
France is going to say that the focus is going to be on attacking Isis .
To be fair , thatâ€ ™ s always been the focus but that hasnâ€ ™ t detracted away [ from ] trying to get rid of Assad.â€ �
Esfandiary added : â€œYou can work with Iran to a certain extent on pushing Isis back in Iraq , because the goals are the same , but the problem is you can try and work with Iran on pushing Isis back in Syria but the goals are different , so there is a point when both sides are going at loggerheads .
I think , as before , thereâ€ ™ s going to be distinction between the fight against Isis in Iraq and the fight against Isis in Syria.â€ �"
2015-12-03,"Hardline sympathisers in Iran have been causing the abrupt closure of concerts , intimidating musicians in a show of force aimed at the moderate administration of President Hassan Rouhani .
Although it has become easier to perform music since Rouhani came to power , an increasing number of performances , including one by Tehranâ€ ™ s reborn symphony orchestra , have been cancelled at the last minute after intervention from forces that remain unknown to the artists .
The cancellations are becoming a major challenge for the president , who is being urged to shift his attention to domestic issues after resolving the impasse over the countryâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
Hardliners , unhappy with the way the nuclear accord boosted Rouhaniâ€ ™ s status at home , are making sure he will have a tough time ahead in the remaining two years of his presidency .
In a recent incident , the Tehran symphony orchestra , which has been revived after a three - year hiatus and was last week due to perform the national anthem at the capitalâ€ ™ s majestic Azadi stadium before a wrestling world cup competition , had to cancel because the authorities insisted 15 minutes before the programme that female musicians should not perform on the stage .
â€œI told them that this was unacceptable and did not allow the performance to go ahead , â€ � its principal conductor , Ali ( Alexander ) Rahbari , told the Guardian .
â€œWe didnâ€
™ t know who they were , or where they came from but they blocked our way even though we had permission .
Itâ€ ™ s complete chaos .
You donâ€
™ t know whose fault it was at the end.â€
�
The orchestra is an institution which has weathered a string of turbulent events in its 80-year history , including a coup , an eight - year war and a revolution .
In March , it was brought back to life after being fully disbanded under the former president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , thanks to Rahbari , a world - class conductor who has led more than 120 European orchestras , including the Berlin Philharmonic and London Philharmonic .
Such acts of cultural sabotage are becoming a familiar pattern .
Numerous other concerts have been cancelled in recent months in Tehran and other big cities .
Artists , who already face draconian regulations before securing permission for a concert , say Rouhaniâ€ ™ s ministry of culture and Islamic guidance is not directly responsible but has failed to act or speak out .
Rouhani , pressed about the issue earlier this year , said : â€œWhen we issue the necessary licences , itâ€ ™ s wrong for other institutions to intervene.â€ � Hardliners have since shown , however , who has the upper hand .
Kayhan Kalhor , one of Iranâ€ ™ s most renowned musicians , with four Grammy nominations , has experienced similar obstacles .
He was scheduled to perform at Tehranâ€ ™ s
Milad Tower in June alongside the Brooklyn Rider , a New York - based string quartet , but their concert was cancelled just days before .
It was meant to be Kalhorâ€ ™ s first Iranian concert in six years and was organised a year in advance .
â€œBrooklyn Rider had got their visas and people in Iran were very happy to host them but at the very last moment , we were told that there was a security concern , â€ �
Kalhor , who plays the kamancheh , an Iranian bowed instrument , told the Guardian .
â€œThe pressure comes from a sector of unknown forces ; we really donâ€ ™ t know who they are .
There are several different fronts who are actually against Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government and they possess a lot of power.â€ �
Kalhor added : â€œThey create problems in order to create chaos , somehow create disappointment for people who voted for this government .
Itâ€ ™ s always been like that for any reformist government.â€ �
The musician , who strongly supported Rouhani during his campaign , said he still has faith in his will but wants him to speak out and do more .
According to Kalhor , the pressure is mostly on musicians and the section of the intelligentsia which is well known and has followings among the younger generation .
Iranâ€ ™ s
great master of Persian classical music , Mohammad - Reza Shajarian , has also not been allowed to perform in the past six years .
â€œThe minister of culture is just watching this in silence , â€ � he said .
â€œThis is not what we expected from Rouhani when he ran for the presidency .
Intellectuals and distinguished artists helped him a lot
and we understand that there is a lot of pressure on him , especially they have the job of rebuilding the economy and getting rid of sanctions .
He should not forget that artists helped him a lot .
We expect him to do something about this worsening situation .
It is becoming prevalent.â€ � Pressure on Iranian artists is not only limited to their performances .
Earlier this week Yaghma Golrouee , a well - known poet and songwriter , was arrested a few weeks after publicly criticising the authorities for not allowing his book to be published .
It also emerged this week that the authorities had blocked the countryâ€ ™ s only non - governmental literary prize , called Aknoon .
The state runs its own literary award , named after writer Jalal Al - e - Ahmad , which is usually a lacklustre event despite its eyecatching prize of 30 gold coins .
Rahbari said musicians should not have to obtain permission to stage concerts in the first place .
The orchestra was also not allowed to perform Mozartâ€ ™ s Requiem last month .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s the use?â€ � he said .
â€œWhen the authorities ban music on stage , people hear it in taxis .
When you ban , people go underground .
Mozartâ€
™ s music has hurt nobody , there is no bad music , good music .
This is entirely arbitrary.â€ �"
2015-12-09,"Iranâ€ ™ s Ettelaat newspaper has strongly objected to the stateâ€ ™ s ban on publishing the name or images of a former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami .
In an unprecedented move underlying the complexities of Tehranâ€ ™ s internal politics , the managing editor of the state - run newspaper , with nearly 90 years of history , wrote a front - page editorial on Wednesday stating that the ban is against the countryâ€ ™ s constitution , which prohibits censorship .
The article , published in the form of a public letter addressed to President Hassan Rouhani , is written by the editor , Seyed Mahmoud Doaei , a reformist cleric who has urged him to intervene and defend the media against a serious threat to press freedom imposed by the hardline judiciary .
Ettelaatâ€ ™ s article on Wednesday mentioned Khatamiâ€ ™ s full name no less than three times .
â€œThe esteemed prosecutor of Tehran held a meeting with a number of managing editors including myself recently , in which he demanded us not to publish articles or images relating to Hojatoleslam [ an Islamic honorific title ]
Khatami , â€ � Doaei wrote in the article .
â€œI told him in that very meeting that this decision is arbitrary ; there is no legislation or law backing it and that Ettelaat would not accept
it.â€
�
The extent of the restrictions has prompted disquiet among the media in Iran , even leading the traditionally passive state - owned publication to speak out .
Ettelaat usually follows a middle line , avoiding sensitive political matters .
It emerged earlier this year that a media blackout had been imposed regarding Khatami , who fell foul of establishment over his support for opposition leaders and former presidential candidates Mir - Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , who have been under house arrest since February 2011 .
Mousaviâ€ ™ s wife , Zahra Rahnavard , a prominent opposition figure , is also under house arrest .
The ban was imposed not by the Rouhani government but by the hardline judiciary and its media watchdog , which act independently of the administration .
But Rouhani is bound under the Iranian constitution to speak out and defend peopleâ€ ™ s rights , and critics say he has been acting too passively on the matter .
Ettelaat first defied the ban on Saturday , printing the Farsi translation of an interview Khatami has recently given to As - Safir , an Arabic newspaper based in Lebanon .
Khatamiâ€ ™ s image was also published alongside the interview .
On Tuesday , news agencies affiliated to the judiciary reported that Doaei was indicted for ignoring the ban , insisting the restrictions on mentioning Khatamiâ€ ™ s name and images remained in place .
Ettelaat has since published other news about Khatami and said it will keep doing so despite threats of prosecution .
It is not clear if Doaei has been formally summoned to a court .
This is paricularly intriguing : Doaei has been appointed directly by the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the ultimate power , as his representative .
Ettelaat also publishes in English and has a monthly magazine published in French , called La Revue de TÃ
© hÃ
© ran , which is aimed at introducing Iranâ€ ™ s culture and art to the Francophones .
It is not the first time the authorities have banned mentions of Khatami in the Iranian media .
In 2010 , a similar ruling was issued against publishing his name or image , as well as those of Mousavi , Rahnavard and Karroubi .
Restrictions were relaxedduring the last presidential elections in 2013 .
Khatami backed Rouhani in those elections and his support was crucial in the victory of the moderate cleric .
Following Rouhaniâ€ ™ s win , Khatami wrote an article for the Guardian in which he urged the west to work with the new president in order to end the standoff over Tehranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
The Islamic republicâ€ ™ s constitution has explicitly made clear that censorship is prohibited but the country has one of the worldâ€ ™ s worst records of press freedom , with dozens of journalists and bloggers currently held behind bars .
Many Iranian journalists , like those working for the BBCâ€ ™ s Persian service , can not return to their country for fear of arrest .
Other methods of harassing journalists include barring them from leaving the country , confiscating their passport and summoning them for interrogation .
Among those held in jail is Jason Rezaian , a Iranian - American Washington Post journalist who has been held for more than a year on charges of spying .
His fate remains unclear ."
2015-12-31,"Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has accused the US of â€œillegal meddlingâ€ � and ordered his defence minister to step up his countryâ€ ™ s ballistic missile programme in response to the prospect of new White House sanctions .
Rouhani reacted angrily to reports that the Obama administration is preparing fresh sanctions against firms and individuals in Iran , Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates .
â€œAs
the US government is clearly still pursuing its hostile policies and illegal meddling â€ ¦ the armed forces need to quickly and significantly increase their missile capability , â€ �
Rouhani wrote in a letter on Thursday to his defence minister , Hossein Dehghan , published on the state news agency IRNA .
The US move , reported by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday , follows a controversial test by Iran in October of its medium - range Emad rocket .
A report by UN sanctions monitors said the missile was capable of carrying a nuclear warhead .
Iran insists the rocket is conventional , and purely for defence .
If they are imposed , the sanctions would be the first by Washington against Iran since Tehran signed a nuclear deal with world powers in July that will eventually involve Washington dropping separate , wider - ranging sanctions targeting that programme .
The Wall Street Journal later reported the US had delayed fresh sanctions , saying that , at one point , they had been scheduled to be announced on Wednesday morning in Washington .
Earlier on Thursday , Iranâ€ ™ s foreign ministry denounced the US administration .
â€œAs we have declared to the American government
â€ ¦ Iranâ€
™ s missile programme has no connection to the [ nuclear ] agreement ,
â€ �
state television quoted spokesman Hossein Jaber Ansari as saying .
Ansari added : â€œIran will resolutely respond to any interfering action by America against its defensive programmes.â€ �
The Wall Street Journal reported that the US treasury department was preparing sanctions on two Iran - linked networks helping develop the missile programme .
Under the planned restrictions , US or foreign nationals would be barred from doing business with the firms and people in the networks .
US banks would also freeze any US - held assets .
A senior US administration official told the Guardian : â€œAs weâ€ ™ ve said , weâ€ ™ ve been looking for some timeâ€ � at options for additional actions related to Iranâ€ ™ s ballistic missile programme based on our continued concerns about its activities , including the October 10th launch .
â€œWe are considering various aspects related to additional designations , as well as evolving diplomatic work that is consistent with our national security interests .
As always , we keep Congress informed about issues related to Iran sanctions , and will continue to do so as we work through remaining issues.â€ �
Iranian officials had previously warned that the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamanei , would view any new US sanctions as a violation of the nuclear deal .
US officials told the newspaper the treasury department maintained the right to sanction Iranian entities allegedly involved in missile development , or those that support rights abuses or international terrorism .
The planned sanctions target UAE - based Mabrooka Trading and its founder , Hossein Pournaghshband , for allegedly helping procure carbon fibre for the missile programme .
Pournaghshband also allegedly used a Hong Kong subsidiary for the heat - resistant materialâ€ ™ s procurement and financing , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Attempts by the newspaper to reach him were unsuccessful .
The treasury is also reportedly preparing to sanction five Iranian officials who allegedly worked on the missile programme .
The planned new sanctions come even as the US prepares to begin lifting earlier , far - reaching international restrictions on Iran related to its nuclear activities .
Rouhani , Iranâ€ ™ s former top nuclear negotiator , hailed the July deal , declaring â€œconstructive engagement worksâ€
� .
Iranâ€ ™ s atomic energy agency said 11 tonnes of uranium materials were sent to Russia on Monday , a move the US secretary of state , John Kerry , said was â€œsignificant progressâ€ � under the 14 July nuclear agreement between Iran and six major powers .
Ballistic missile tests by Iran are banned under security council resolution 1929 , which dates from 2010 and remains valid until the July nuclear deal between Iran and world powers goes into effect .
Once the deal takes effect , Iran will still be â€œcalled uponâ€ � not to undertake any ballistic missiles work designed to deliver nuclear weapons for a period of up to eight years , according to a security council resolution adopted in July right after the nuclear deal .
Iran says the resolution would only ban missiles â€œdesignedâ€ � to carry a nuclear warhead , not â€œcapable ofâ€
�
, so it would not affect its military programme as Tehran does not pursue nuclear weapons .
When the nuclear deal is implemented Iran will be allowed to return to the international financial system , receive billions of dollars that were frozen by foreign banks , and sell greater quantities of oil abroad .
Reuters and Agence France - Presse contributed to this report"
2016-01-06,"I am not surprised that Tehran has been somewhat paralysed over Riyadhâ€ ™ s decision to break off ties after an Iranian mob attacked the Saudi embassy following the execution of the leading Saudi Shia cleric , Nimr Baghir al - Nimr , on 2 January .
Since President Hassan Rouhani assumed office in August 2013 , he has failed to formulate responses to Saudi policies challenging Iran , so prompting criticism from hardliners that his lack of leadership fans Riyadhâ€ ™ s intransigence .
The failure is clear in statements issued by Rouhaniâ€ ™ s aides since Riyadh severed ties and other Gulf Arab states downgraded relations .
Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister , has spent the better half of his time talking to western counterparts rather than trying with Iranâ€ ™ s Arab neighbours to find a way to reduce tensions with Riyadh .
Iran expected mass western condemnation of the Saudisâ€ ™ execution of Nimr .
Only when this failed to materialise did Tehranâ€ ™ s UN ambassador , Gholam Ali Khoshroo , express regret over the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran .
Iranâ€ ™ s
belated letter to the UN Security Council , saying 40 people had been arrested for the embassy attacks , came only once Saudi Arabia had already filed a complaint and the councilâ€ ™ s 15 members had condemned Iran - so putting Tehran at odds with the international community as it tries to end the controversy over its nuclear programme .
Neither did much result from Iranâ€ ™ s attempts to build a wedge between Riyadh and the European Union through President Rouhaniâ€ ™ s offer after the severing of ties with the Saudis to fight alongside the Europeans against Sunni extremists .
Yes , the EU is sympathetic to Iranâ€ ™ s position , and wary of Saudi Arabia , but Europe has never been a reliable partner for Iran .
The EU wants to ensure the continued flow of oil and gas , and to protect wider business interests within the region , but has neither the power nor the commitment to take sides in a long battle of wills between Tehran and Riyadh .
If it did , the conflict in Syria would be long resolved .
Aside from engaging Europe , Iranâ€ ™ s response has been rhetorical .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the supreme leader , has said the Saudis will face â€œdivine vengeanceâ€ � .
Eshaq Jahangiri , a vice president , has suggested Saudi Arabia will suffer from severing diplomatic ties but did not elaborate .
Hamid Aboutalebi , nominated by Iran as UN ambassador but refused a visa in 2014 by the United States , has warned the Arab states not to act against Iran given Iran has cards to play .
Again , he did not specify which cards Iran might be holding .
President Rouhaniâ€ ™ s own response to the break - up of ties , criticising Nimrâ€ ™ s execution as well as the mob attack , came fully 24 hours after the Saudi embassy was assaulted .
While his statement seemed reasonable , its timing suggested it was a means to appease hardliners who still fault Rouhaniâ€ ™ s inaction over the accident in Mecca in 2015 that led to the death of over 450 Iranian pilgrims performing the hajj .
Such distressed statements by Iranâ€ ™ s authorities reflect the simple fact that Iran has been outmanoeuvred .
They also reveal Iranâ€ ™ s lack of any clear or consistent policy towards Saudi Arabia .
The severing of diplomatic ties was a slap across the face .
Iranian officials have consistently bragged to me that even in hard times , the Saudis and Iranians had retained embassies in each otherâ€ ™ s capitals .
Now , Tehranâ€ ™ s efforts trying to be both conciliatory and firm only point to the bind it is in .
As a conservative president , Rouhani is anxious to strike a middle ground at home .
That includes not being either too hostile or too friendly towards Saudi Arabia , with which Iran has had historical rivalries .
He has done so in his own style , which means avoiding direct responsibility for controversial policy and instead passing decisions to aides .
Nowhere was this more clear than over the nuclear agreement with world powers , which Zarif received a free hand to negotiate , despite the red lines that Iranâ€ ™ s leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , sought frequently to draw in the course of the talks .
When I first spoke to the Iranian president in New York in September 2013 , he asked for my opinion on how a tricky interview could best be handled .
I was impressed that President Rouhani felt at ease asking for help and taking advice , but also detected a tendency to delegate decisions .
This style also serves to keep open the Iranian
presidentâ€ ™ s
options with domestic opponents .
Rouhani tends to avoid criticism by allowing those around him to take on the task of convincing the Iranian public about his foreign policy .
That way , he remains more immune to the barrage of onslaughts from both hardliners and reformists .
But Rouhani remains vulnerable over foreign policy .
An immediate challenge is a growing popular dislike in Iran of Saudi Arabia due to the beheadings of Iranian pilgrims convicted of various crimes and the death of hundreds more during the hajj .
Popular sentiments have an impact on the political elite , who themselves fault Riyadh , often in public , for encouraging the growth of Sunni extremism , including the Islamic State , in Iraq and Syria .
While the government in Tehran aims to contain criticism of the kingdom , negative views about the Saudis fester as Rouhani fails to achieve progress in fixing ties or to offer any credible alternative .
When I interpreted for the Iranian president at the UN General Assembly meetings in New York in September 2013 , I felt concern over relations with the Saudis .
Amir Hussein Zamaninia , a close Rouhani advisor , told me the president would not accept an invitation to Saudi Arabia extended to him by the late King Abdullah .
While I believed this would upset Riyadh and damage Saudi - Iranian relations , I avoided making any comments .
It did not surprise me that when , around a year later , nothing came of talk about Zarif going to Riyadh .
Nor that he received a cold shoulder when he went to pay condolences when King Abdullah died in January 2015 .
Back at the UN in September 2013 , I did tell Hesamuldin Ashna , a senior communications adviser to Rouhani , that Iran could not expect to reap the full benefits of a nuclear deal with the US ( which was Rouhaniâ€ ™ s most important foreign policy goal ) without improving ties with Saudi Arabia .
Ashna was not convinced those ties were as critical as I suggested , forcing me to stress that repairing them could take the full eight years of a two - term Rouhani presidency .
While it was understandable that neither Zamaninia nor Ashna would admit to me any concerns they had over the Saudis , I was left with a nagging feeling
they did not recognise the level of hostility Riyadh felt towards Tehran over its nuclear goals , a hostility that went back even before the presidency of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
After his trip to New York , Rouhani delegated policy towards the Gulf Arab states to Zarif , who may feel less comfortable in discussions with Iranâ€ ™ s Arab neighbours than with the west .
Other Iranian officials who have taken on the mantle of repairing relations with Saudi Arabia have only confused matters .
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who had been close to King Abdullah , fell out with the king once he and Rouhani were forced , probably under pressure from hardliners in Iran , to reject an invitation to the hajj in October 2013 .
Ali Shamkhani , Secretary of Iranâ€ ™ s Supreme National Security Council and a native Arabic speaker , played a key role reaching out to Saudi Arabia under Abdullah , but he has also issued mixed statements .
On one hand , Shamkhani has offered friendship to Riyadh to resolve differences , but he has also been vocal in criticising the kingdom for fuelling unrest among Iranâ€ ™ s ethnic Arabs and Sunni populations .
Hussein Amir - Abdollahian , Iranâ€ ™ s deputy foreign minister for Arab affairs , has certainly called for better understanding between Iran and the Gulf Arab states .
But when I spoke to him in Tehran in June 2014 , he did not anticipate the clearly pending departure of Nouri al - Maliki , who was facing widespread unrest in Iraq , and instead stressed Iranâ€ ™ s support for the besieged Iraqi prime minister .
After repeated calls for Malikiâ€ ™ s departure by both the Saudis and the US , it was only in July that Tehran reluctantly dispatched Shamkhani to Baghdad to seal an understanding over a new prime minister , Heidar al - Abadi , who took office in September .
Another dimension to Iranâ€ ™ s lack of outreach to Saudi Arabia is Rouhaniâ€ ™
s hope that Tehran can replace Riyadhâ€ ™ s close relationship with Washington with one of its own .
Long before Rouhani became president , he and his team dreamed of a â€˜grand bargainâ€ ™ with the US , which is a concept
Iranâ€ ™ s
Arab neighbours find unsettling because they fear it implies a threat to their own interests .
In this whole process , Tehran ignores the obvious .
The Arab states of the Gulf region are still the preferred partners for the US due to a longer history of friendship .
Even before the Iranian Revolution , Washington was more at ease with Saudi Arabia , given the Shahâ€ ™ s regional ambitions , and even then the Arab states resented Iranâ€ ™ s unwillingness to see them as equal partners in the social , cultural and political development of the Gulf region .
The US - Saudi friendship will not suddenly end , even though Washington and the EU are openly condemning Riyadhâ€ ™ s human rights record .
Trade between Saudi Arabia and the west still outweighs their differences over political reform in the kingdom , as does a mutual agreement between Washington and Riyadh to contain Iranâ€ ™ s influence in the Middle East .
This prospect will not change when a new president assumes office in Washington at the beginning of 2017 .
None of the US presidential candidates promise to be a better option for Iran than President Barack Obama .
Prospects for Iranâ€ ™ s relations with Saudi Arabia depend on both sides refusing to see ties with the US as a replacement for a partnership between them as neighbours .
A shared recognition that their political differences result partly from instability in the Middle East in which the US has self - admittedly played a role could help them rekindle the political and religious connections that go back to the establishment of formal friendship ties in 1929 .
Since then , Riyadh and Tehran have severed relations three times , only to recognise subsequently that their ties needed urgently to be repaired .

2016-01-09,"The war of words between Iran and Saudi Arabia and the breakdown in diplomatic ties is bad news for President Hassan Rouhani and his efforts to bring Iran out of isolation .
It also threatens to escalate the sectarian tensions pushing the region deeper into crisis .
The 3 January mob attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad , protesting the execution of Shia cleric Nimr al - Nimr in Saudi Arabia , was reminiscent of both the attack on the US embassy in the wake of the 1979 revolution and the 2011 ransacking of the British embassy in Tehran .
The consequences of these attacks were severe for Iran , initially branding Iran as a pariah state and subsequently reinforcing that image .
The latest attack on the Saudi embassy is consistent with this pattern , one that Rouhani and his foreign minister Javad Zarif have been trying very hard to change .
In his first speech at the United Nations general assembly , Rouhani spoke of Iranâ€ ™ s commitment to a new era of peace , dialogue and moderation .
He promised Iran to be an anchor of stability in the region .
With the signing of the nuclear deal with the P5 + 1 , which promised to bring Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear program under an exceptionally strict inspection regime in return for the removal of sanctions , the Rouhani / Zarif team appeared to have some significant success .
They sought to present Iran as a â€œnormalâ€ � state and shake off the baggage of ideology in its international affairs .
The 2015 invitation to join peace talks over the Syrian crisis following the signing of the nuclear deal was the first tangible dividend of the Rouhani approach .
But Rouhaniâ€ ™ s success is not irreversible .
His internal critics have accused Rouhani of compromising too much and being weak against international and regional bullies , code names for the United States and Saudi Arabia .
A senior commander of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , for example , bluntly rejected the deal â€ “ a message that was echoed by the Kayhan daily ( close to the Revolutionary Guards ) .
Hossein Shariatmadari , editor of Kayhan , wrote : Even by simply looking at the deal you can see some vital red lines of the Islamic Republic have not been preserved .
The hardliners were already critical of the governmentâ€ ™ s handling of the Hajj disaster when more than 400 Iranian pilgrims died in Mecca .
The execution of Sheikh al - Nimr offered an opportunity for them to lash out at Saudi Arabia and undermine the Rouhani government in one move .
The conservative daily Kayhan ran an editorial which labelled the Saudi monarchy an extension of the US - Zionism in the region , fanning the fires that engulfed the Saudi embassy in Tehran .
The Saudis have complained that the Iranian security forces facilitated the attack , a believable charge given that the security apparatus is aligned with the hardline faction in Iranian politics .
The diplomatic breakdown puts the Rouhani government in a very tough situation .
Rouhani has tried to be firm but measured in his response , without looking weak .
He called the execution of al - Nimr a political move to silence dissent and a violation of human rights , but didnâ€ ™ t go any further .
Following the ransacking of the Saudi embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad , Rouhani took to Twitter to condemn the attacks and asked the interior ministry to prosecute such acts of extremism .
But his position is increasingly untenable when the Supreme Leader has come out to condemn the Saudis who have â€œshed the blood of martyrsâ€ � .
This diplomatic crisis , expounded by the severance of diplomatic ties by Bahrain and Sudan , is a U - turn for Iranâ€ ™ s fortunes in the region .
Since its inception , the Islamic Republic of Iran has been very much aware of the limitations of sectarian identity for its regional ambitions .
While tied to a minority sect in Islam , Iran has consciously advocated Muslim unity to overcome the Shia - Sunni divide .
Unfortunately for Iranian leaders , the Syrian crisis quickly turned into a sectarian conflict with Iran and Saudi Arabia supporting opposite ends of the war .
It is common in Iranian public commentary to draw a line connecting the Islamic State ( Isis ) with the Wahhabi ideology of Saudi Arabia .
With this latest row , sectarian tensions and clashes are likely to rise .
There are reports of clashes in the Sunni populated parts of Iran and the Shia populated parts of Saudi Arabia .
The sectarian scourge is destabilising the whole region , from Syria to Yemen .
Thatâ€ ™ s damaging to everyone .
But the sectarian conflict hurts Iran ( especially Rouhaniâ€ ™ s vision of Iran ) most , because it boxes Tehran in a corner with only Shia friends .
That only validates the charge that Iran is pushing a sectarian agenda in the region .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s attempt at normalising Iranâ€ ™ s relations with the international community and its neighbouring countries has hit a wall .
Recent developments threaten to undo his gains on the international stage , and undermine his ability to keep his internal critics at bay .
This is likely to pan out badly for the reformist camp in the parliamentary elections next month .
Reformists have traditionally suffered at the ballot box in times of crisis .
While Rouhaniâ€ ™ s international performance and the signing of the nuclear deal was a source of optimism for them , the latest downturn and the growing assertiveness of the hardline and conservative factions do not bode well for a reformist ascendancy in the next parliament ."
2016-01-16,"Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has hailed a â€œglorious victoryâ€ � after senior diplomats in Vienna formally announced the lifting of sanctions against the country following confirmations from the UN that Tehran had fulfilled its obligations under last yearâ€ ™ s nuclear accord .
A final report by the International Atomic Energy Agency released late on Saturday triggered the much anticipated announcement of â€œImplementation Dayâ€ � , which puts Iran on the brink of an extraordinary transformation , reconnecting it to the global economy .
â€œToday we have achieved Implementation Day of the joint comprehensive plan of action , â€ �
Iranâ€ ™ s
foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , and the EU foreign policy chief , Federica Mogherini , said in a joint statement read at the UN in the Austrian capital in front of the world media .
The US secretary of state , John Kerry â€ “ who was also in Vienna , said the sanctions termination provisions of Iranâ€ ™ s landmark nuclear agreement were now in effect .
Barack Obama delegated authority to Kerry to make the determination .
At the same time , all nuclear - related sanctions imposed by the EU and the UN were also lifted .
The move came after a remarkable day that saw the release of four dual nationals and a teenage student in a prisoner swap with the US .
They included the Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian , who had been held on charges of spying for over a year .
The Iranian - Americans were released in exchange for seven Iranian nationals held in US prisons , apparently for violating sanctions .
The timing of the prisoner swap suggests that the issue had been discussed on the sidelines of the nuclear talks , despite denial from both sides .
Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , who is due to deliver a live TV address on Sunday , reacted on Twitter by calling for a push for global peace .
Kerry , meanwhile , said the American prisoners â€œshould be on their way homeâ€ � .
â€œI am very happy to say , as we speak , we have received confirmation that five Americans that have been unjustly detained in Iran have been released , â€ �
he said in a statement .
â€œThey should be on their way home to their families before long.â€ �
The UN chief , Ban Ki - moon , welcomed the implementation of the nuclear accord and said : â€œThis achievement demonstrates that international proliferation concerns are best addressed through dialogue and patient diplomacy.â€ � Earlier in the day , Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister , had hailed the milestone as â€œa good dayâ€ � for Iran and for the international community .
In the words of a report by leading Russian investment firm Renaissance Capital , Iran is â€œthe last remaining sizable global economy that has been cut off from international capital to reopenâ€ � .
The UKâ€ ™ s foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , said : â€œThe nuclear deal with Iran , in which Britain played a major role , makes the Middle East and the wider world a safer place .
Years of patient and persistent diplomacy , and difficult technical work , have borne fruit as we now implement the deal .
â€œThere were many sceptics who said Iran would never deliver on its side of the bargain , but the independent International Atomic Energy Agency has said they have .
Tonnes of uranium have been shipped out of Iran , thousands of centrifuges have been taken out of use and the core has been removed from the Arak reactor .
Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme has been substantially rolled back , in return for the lifting of sanctions and the economic benefits that will bring .
â€œThe UK has played a central role , and I hope British businesses seize the opportunities available to them through the phased lifting of sanctions on Iran .
The future is as important as the landmark weâ€ ™ ve reached today.â€ �
Rouhani particularly wants his people to feel the impact of the nuclear deal in their everyday lives before parliamentary elections in February .
Iranian banks will soon re - establish connections with the European financial system , and private firms can now pursue business opportunities without fear of western punishment .
About $ 30bn ( Â£21bn ) of a total of $ 100bn in frozen assets will be released to Iran imminently .
The lifting of sanctions , which will include an end to an EU embargo on imports of Iranian oil , will also affect the global oil market , as Tehran is expected to immediately add almost half a million barrels per day to crude exports .
This is likely to add to downward pressure on an oil price that is already plummeting due to oversupply .
The Mehr news agency said a group of oil executives from Total and Shell were in Tehran on Saturday for talks with Iranian officials on the sidelines of an oil conference marking the 60th anniversary of the national Iranian tanker company .
Iran has already unveiled a set of new lucrative oil contracts worth tens of billions of dollars to lure foreign investment .
The mood in Tehran is upbeat , but many remain cautious .
The index of the Tehran stock market rose to its highest level in 18 months on Saturday morning .
Reuters reported that as many as 13 Iranian crude carriers were on course to be fully loaded and prepared to leave for India and Europe .
President Barack Obama on Friday night also lifted the ban on the sale of passenger planes to Iran , a decades - long restriction that resulted in Iranâ€ ™ s fleet being very old , prone to accidents and faults .
Zarif said : â€œThis is a very good day for the Iranian people â€ ¦ a very good day for the region .
Our region will be relieved of the shadow of an unnecessary conflict that could have caused worry .
This is also a good day for the world .
Today is a day when we prove to the world that threats , sanctions , intimidation , pressure donâ€ ™ t work ; respect works .
â€œThrough respect , through dialogue , through negotiations , we can in fact reach mutually acceptable solutions , implement mutually acceptable solutions , prove that the naysayers were always wrong , and therefore move towards a world in which diplomacy â€ “ not force , not pressure â€ “ will prevail.â€ �
The west has already put in place the legislation for lifting sanctions , meaning that it is not subject to further paperwork .
European companies will be able to resume business with Iran , but US companies are still hampered by terrorism , human rights and ballistic missile - related sanctions that will remain in place .
Foreign companies dealing with Iran will however no longer be punished by the US .
â€œImplementation Day is a demonstration of how persistent , high - level engagement is a critical ingredient for successful policies between Iran and the international community , â€ � said Reza Marashi of the National Iranian American Council , who followed the nuclear talks closely .
He said direct diplomacy between Kerry and Zarif â€œwas the linchpin of this peaceful outcome .
In the absence of US - Iran dialogue , accidents such as [ the recent capture of US sailors ] could have quickly escalated .
Thanks to the Iran nuclear deal , a sustained diplomatic channel now exists to de - escalate .
The entire Middle East will benefit if this is the new normalâ€ � .
Hossein Rassam , a London - based Iranian analyst , said the removal of sanctions would bring two years of intensive diplomacy to fruition .
â€œThe significance of the post - implemenation day period is that sectors of the Iranian economy , such as trade and oil , can , after many years , experience relative normalcy , â€ � he said .
John Forrest , head of international trade in London at the law firm DLA Piper , said : â€œAs a significant and diverse emerging market , Iran presents substantial opportunities for European businessesâ€ � â€ “ particularly those in the energy sector , manufacturing , retail , consumer goods , food and drink , and financial institutions and services .
â€œFrom a practical perspective , it remains to be seen whether EU sanction relief will be held back should banks continue to take a cautious approach to processing Iranian payment transactions , â€ � he said .
Forrest also said ongoing human rights and terrorism - related sanctions in the US would have an effect .
â€œWhile the EU piece of the puzzle is clear , as it has already published relevant legislation amending existing sanctions measures to pave the way for early EU termination , there remains a lack of clarity with regards to the US.â€ �"
2016-01-17,"Global oil prices will remain under pressure this week after Iran said it was ready to add half a million barrels a day to crude exports just hours after international sanctions were lifted this weekend .
Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , hailed a â€œglorious victoryâ€ � as his country relished reconnecting to the global economy following the formal announcement late on Saturday that sanctions were ending thanks to moves by Tehran to scale back its nuclear programme .
Iran returns to international oil markets with prices hovering near 12-year lows because of a supply glut and waning global demand as economic growth falters .
The prospect of Iran flooding the market with more crude had already dented prices last week , pushing Brent crude below $ 30 a barrel .
Echoing Fridayâ€ ™ s sell - off on commodity and global stock markets , shares in the Middle East tumbled on Sunday .
Saudi Arabiaâ€ ™ s Tadawul index was down more than 6 % as the latest drop in crude prices intensified worries over the economic outlook for the major oil producer .
In Egypt , shares extended last weekâ€ ™ s losses on broader worries over emerging markets and the EGX 30 index was down 3 % .
The lifting of sanctions includes an end to an EU embargo on imports of Iranian oil and on Sunday the country confirmed it was geared up to raise exports .
â€œWith consideration to global market conditions and the surplus that exists , Iran is ready to raise its crude oil exports by 500,000 barrels a day , â€ � the deputy oil minister , Amir Hossein Zamaninia , was quoted as saying by the Shana news agency .
But Rouhani also suggested the new era could reduce Iranâ€ ™ s dependence on oil .
He described the deal as a â€œturning pointâ€ � and an opportunity for Iranâ€ ™ s economy to cut its â€œumbilical cordâ€ � to oil while prices were low .
Oil prices have almost halved in the last six months amid worries about oversupply and softening demand on the back of a weaker global economic outlook and a downturn in China , the worldâ€ ™ s biggest energy user .
Analysts noted that the return of Iran to oil markets could have relatively little impact on prices over coming days given it was largely anticipated .
â€œOil could stabilise as the lifting of Iran sanctions is surely now reflected in the low price and increasingly the focus will turn to the prospect of further cuts in non - Opec supply , particularly from the US , â€ � said Caroline Bain and Julian Jessop at the consultancy Capital Economics .
The ending of sanctions also means Iranian banks will soon re - establish links with the European financial system , and its businesses can trade with overseas partners .
The UKâ€ ™ s foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , highlighted the potential economic impact as he welcomed the nuclear deal with Iran and the lifting of sanctions .
â€œThe UK has played a central role , and I hope British businesses seize the opportunities available to them through the phased lifting of sanctions on Iran .
The future is as important as the landmark weâ€ ™ ve reached today , â€ �
Hammond said in a statement .
The French - listed aircraft maker Airbus also looks set for a significant boost from the sanctions ending .
Iran said on Saturday that it planned to buy 114 civil aircraft from the company .
A deal for 114 planes would be worth more than $ 10bn at catalogue prices , depending on the type of aircraft , news agency Reuters reported ."
2016-01-17,"Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has hailed a â€œgolden pageâ€ � in the countryâ€ ™ s history and a â€œturning pointâ€ � in its economy as Iranians enjoyed the first day without sanctions , with banks reconnected to the global banking systems .
The end of decade - long sanctions lifted the spirit of Iranians after western officials formally abolished a complex network of punitive measure as the landmark nuclear deal was implemented .
The mood in Tehran was upbeat , with many people optimistic of the post - sanctions era , but there were no reports of street celebrations as witnessed last summer .
On Sunday morning , Rouhani delivered his budget before the Iranian parliament before appearing at a press conference with international media , where he said : â€œToday is a historic and exceptional day in the political and economic history of the people of Iran.â€ �
The moderate cleric said he had fulfilled his main election promise that â€œcentrifuges will turn and so will the wheels of peopleâ€ ™ s
livelihoodsâ€ � .
â€œAfter 12 years of patience and resistance ... we have reached a turning point , â€ � he said .
â€œFrom today , merchants and entrepreneurs in our country can benefit from normal ways of banking transactions to start their exports ... from today , our banks are reconnected to the worldâ€ ™ s banking system ... from today , the restrictions on our oil exports are lifted ... from today , our companies can buy modern passenger planes , ensuring the safety of our people in the air .
â€œToday is the day of victory .
Itâ€ ™ s now made clear that our great power is power of diplomacy , something that many in the region and the world did not want to believe .
A new chapter has begun in our relations with the countries in the region and the broader world.â€ �
In the audience were the wives of the Iranian nuclear scientists who were assassinated under mysterious circumstances in the past five years .
Sanctions were lifted on Saturday after confirmation from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that Tehran had complied with the nuclear deal .
It came after an extraordinary day during which four dual nationals , including the Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian , were released in a prisoner swap with the US .
All nuclear - related sanctions imposed by the US , the EU and the UN were lifted , including an embargo on imports of Iranian oil , but other sanctions related to human rights and terrorism remained in place .
Iranians reacted by congratulating each other on social networks including Facebook and Telegram , but they were subdued in comparison to street jubilations seen last July after the announcement of the landmark nuclear deal .
Many remained cautious , aware of the challenges ahead .
The Tehran stock exchange performed strongly and the end to sanctions dominated Sundayâ€ ™ s front pages in Tehran .
â€œSanctions are gone , â€ � proclaimed the headline of the reformist Aftab - e - Yazd .
â€œThe morning without sanctions , â€ � said Etemaad , while the front page of the state - run Iran newspaper read : â€œSanctions dissolved.â€
�
Earlier in the day , Rouhani was at the Iranian parliament , Majlis , promising internal development and more stability in the region .
â€œWe should use this opportunity for the countryâ€ ™ s growth and development and peopleâ€ ™ s welfare , as well as the security and stability of the region , â€ �
Rouhani told Iranian parliamentarians .
â€œThis would not be possible unless we all unite with each other.â€
�
â€œEverybody is happy about the nuclear deal , except for Zionists , those who are seeking division in the Muslim world , and a small extremist group in the US , â€ � he added , referring to the Israeli government and Republicans in the US Congress who have opposed the nuclear accord signed last July .
The declaration of â€œimplementation dayâ€ � met with a warm response internationally , including by the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , and the UK foreign secretary , Philip Hammond .
In the US , Hillary Clinton welcomed the release of American prisoners from Iran and said the world was a safer place as a result of the nuclear agreement , but she urged further sanctions to be imposed on Tehran because of its ballistic missile programme .
â€œI am greatly relieved by the safe return of American prisoners from Iran , â€ � the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination said in a statement late on Saturday .
â€œThese prisoners were held unjustly by a regime that continues to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East ...
Another American , Bob Levinson , still isnâ€ ™ t home with his family.â€
�
The fate of Levinson , a former FBI agent who went missing in Iran , remains unclear .
Rezaian was reported by the semi - official Tasnim news agency to have departed the country alongside his wife , Yeganeh Salehi .
This was confirmed in the US by a senior administration official who said : â€œWe can confirm that our detained US citizens have been released and that those who wished to depart Iran have left.â€ � Rezaianâ€ ™ s brother , Ali , said he was â€œincredibly relievedâ€
� that the reporter was on his way home .
â€œAfter nearly a year and a half of arbitrary delays , and an unfair , opaque judicial process , Jasonâ€ ™ s release has brought indescribable relief and joy to our family â€
“
this nightmare is approaching an end , â€ � he said in a statement .
The four Iranian - Americans were released in exchange for the freedom of seven Iranians held in the US on charges of violating sanctions regulations , including Nima Golestaneh , who has been identified as an Iranian hacker .
The names of 14 other Iranians were also removed from Interpolâ€ ™ s red notice .
Clinton said Iran had dismantled centrifuges , disabled a reactor and shipped out almost all of its enriched uranium , which she said were important steps â€œthat make the United States , our allies , and the entire world saferâ€ � .
But she added : â€œIran is still violating UN security council resolutions with its ballistic missile programme , which should be met with new sanctions designations and firm resolve.â€ � Shane Bauer , an American hiker who was jailed in Iran in 2009 along with two other US nationals after crossing into the country and held for two years , criticised Clinton for calling for further sanctions when Iran was rejoicing at sanctions relief :
In Tehran , many people stayed up late on Saturday to hear the confirmation of the lifting of sanctions .
â€œLast night , the people of the Islamic [ Republic ] of Iran went to sleep with a peaceful mind to wake up for the horizon of a day without sanctions , â€ �
Etemaadâ€ ™ s editor , Javad Daliri , wrote in an editorial .
â€œYes ,
at 1 am , the wall of sanctions finally collapsed.â€ �
Others , including Fereydoun Majlesi , of the Vaghaye - Etefaghieh , struck a cautious note , saying the situation would not improve overnight .
â€œThis is a huge development but not a miracle , â€ � he wrote .
â€œWe shouldnâ€ ™ t have overexpectations.â€ �
Many people shared their thoughts online .
Citing years of financial difficulties due to sanctions , a 30-year - old said on Facebook : â€œMaybe dollar will get cheaper , maybe petrol too , but I wonâ€ ™ t become 25-year - old again .
The real hero is me , who has paid the cost with my youth.â€ �
As sanctions are lifted , Iran is reconnected to the global economy , with banks re - establishing links to the European financial system via Swift , which facilitates international transactions .
Western firms are now free to pursue business opportunities with Iran but US companies are still hampered by other sanctions that are still in force .
More than $ 30bn ( Â£21bn ) of Iranâ€ ™ s estimated $ 100bn in frozen assets were expected to be made available to Tehran immediately and Iran was due to increase its crude exports by more than 500,000 barrels a day , which will have an impact on a global oil market already in turmoil because of oversupply .
On Sunday , stock markets in Saudi Arabia , Tehranâ€ ™ s regional rival , and the UAE fell in expectation of Iran increasing its crude exports .
Tensions between Tehran and Riyadh have risen recently since the Saudi execution of a prominent Shia cleric that led to the storming of the Saudi embassy in Iran .
On Sunday , Rouhani used strong language to condemn Saudi policies in the region .
â€œToday , a Saudi official expressed sadness over the implementation of the nuclear deal .
That is not how a neighbour should behave , â€ � the Iranian president said .
â€œSaudi Arabia mistreats the people of the region .
Why should they bombard their Muslim neighbour , killing its poor people ?
Why should they execute a religious scholar who was respected by a faction of the Saudi population ?
Saudi Arabia has taken to a wrong path.â€ �
It was announced on Saturday that Iran was buying as many as 114 passenger planes from Airbus , renewing its ageing fleet in the near future ."
2016-01-18,"As sanctions were lifted this past weekend following Iranâ€ ™ s implementation of the nuclear agreement with world powers , President Hassan Rouhani again called for Iran to rely less on the sale of oil and to reform the economy .
But according to an analysis of Iranian politics based on game theory , economic reform is unlikely during the rest of his first presidential term , which ends in 2017 .
Using the principles of game - theory , I evaluated the calculations and likely decisions of the main factions within Iran and determined the likely direction Iran is headed .
Game theory is a subfield of micro - economics focused on the mathematical study of conflict and cooperation between decision - makers .
Outcomes are determined by calculating the payoffs stakeholders incur for supporting or opposing differing economic policies .
I estimated the payoffs of the factions in Iran by ranking their known preferences over economic liberalisation , regional posture and domestic security .
I calculated the range of combinations for these to estimate the degree to which the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and hardline factions would support or oppose Rouhaniâ€ ™ s agenda of economic reform .
The lifting of sanctions coupled with the release of up to $ 100bn in frozen Iranian assets as part of the nuclear agreement will reinvigorate the Iranian economy , removing a significant obstacle to growth .
Nonetheless , the road to economic development remains rocky due to highly inefficient state - controlled enterprises and the lack of transparency resulting in high levels of corruption , as evidenced by Transparency International placing the country as low as 136 out of 175 countries on its Corruption Perceptions Index based on â€œhow corrupt a countryâ€ ™ s public sector is perceived to beâ€ � .
These factors make the business environment unfriendly to foreign investment .
Some might say Tehranâ€ ™ s hotels are today crammed with foreign business people , but a few full hotels in a country of 75 million people is no evidence Iran is welcoming to foreign business .
The World Bank ranks Iran at 118 , way down the list , on â€˜ease of doing businessâ€ ™ .
The Rouhani administration is attempting to change this by pushing for robust economic reforms , seeking to pull the Iranian economy out of isolation into a global market and to attract much needed investment from abroad .
He says he wants to change a situation where Iranâ€ ™ s exports are almost entirely hydrocarbon commodities and where it is conducting import substitution as a policy to protect state - owned and quasi - state owned enterprises .
The prospects for substantive economic reform are poor .
Using the rules of game theory to calculate the payoffs of the various factions within Iran , we find that not only is Rouhani unlikely to achieve significant change , but that the likely path for Iran following the lifting of sanctions will be a scaling back to cosmetic attempts at reform .
Iran will remain a closed economy for the remainder of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s presidential term .
We can determine the prospects of economic reform in Iran by analysing four factors to assess whether various factions will support President Rouhaniâ€ ™ s economic policy agenda : these are security over the population , ideology , regional posture , and willingness to reform the economy .
Competing internal factions within Iran are broadly divided between hardliner camps , moderates led by President Rouhani , the bazaar merchants , and Khamenei .
External players such as Russia , China , the European Union and the United States also contribute to the governmentâ€ ™ s calculations over economic reform .
The hardliners seek an Iran that is highly authoritarian under a resistance ideology closing the country to the rest of the world , and a regional posture that is more militaristic than diplomatic .
The leaderâ€ ™ s preferences are close to those of the hardliners .
Khamenei realises that minor cosmetic reforms might be necessary as a token concession for appeasing the influential bazaar merchants and the popular Rouhani administration , but he has not supported privatisation but has rather put state - owned enterprises in the hands of government and former government officials to give the illusion of privatization .
On the opposite side of the spectrum , the bazaaris and the moderate camp seek an Iran driven by economic liberalisation , a loosened security state that is more conducive to foreign investment , a less militaristic regional posture that is better for trade , and a non - resistance ideology that is open to globalisation .
The divergence of views among these competing factions reveals a political tug of war that according to my calculations will favour the more powerful hardliners and the leader rather than the moderates and bazaar merchants .
According to game - theoretic calculations , economic reforms can take place only if several conditions change .
First , Khamenei would have to loosen the security conditions that have resulted in the arrest of several journalists and intimidation of foreigners seeking to invest in the country .
He would also have to loosen his â€˜resistanceâ€ ™ ideology that has produced policies that have economically isolated Iran from the rest of the world and that can not be explained as a response to sanctions .
This means Khamenei would have to aggressively support changing Iranâ€ ™ s insular policies on import substitution , the replacing of cheaper or more desired imports with domestically produced goods through state - controlled enterprises and subsidies .
Lastly , he will need to take a friendlier regional posture , which would be difficult given the current rivalry with Iranâ€ ™ s Arab neighbour , including Saudi Arabia , and Turkey , which is seen most intensely in the conflict in Iraq and Syria .
A country in conflict with its neighbours will not be able to open or reform its economy because the many secondary effects .
First , part of the political capital needed for economic reform is diverted to conflict and conflict - rhetoric .
Second , countries seeking business with Iran incur a larger political cost for doing so if they also do business with neighbours who are at odds with the country .
Germany , Italy , and Britain are well aware of these costs .
Short of the leader making a substantial shift in his actions , significant economic reforms could be implemented only if power in Iran were balanced more in favouring of the more reform - minded Rouhani administration .
Iran remains an authoritarian state that is disproportionately driven by hardliners .
Iranâ€ ™ s hardliners may have opposed the nuclear deal , but Khamenei , who supported the agreement for financial and security reasons , is closely aligned to the hardliners over economic and social policies .
This makes economic reform unlikely because the current balance of power leans in favour of the supreme leader and other hardliners , who are motivated not just by economic considerations .
The release of $ 100bn in frozen assets and the lifting of sanctions will give Iran a substantial increase in capital flow .
According to the World Bank , economic growth will increase from 3 % in 2015 to 5 % in 2016 .
But the absence of significant reform means Iran will remain an austere environment for those seeking to invest in segments other than hydrocarbons and traditional quasi - state owned commodity products such as pistachios .
Iranâ€ ™ s
most valuable asset â€ “ its highly educated labour force
â€ “ will not be utilised effectively .
The lack of economic reform will continue to place a heavy toll on the middle class and particularly its underemployed youth .
Rising expectations will have to be met and increasing oil revenue , with sanctions lifted , will be enough for the economy to grow without forcing the issue of reform .
This can end up providing more incentives not to reform the economy .
These circumstances are not unique to Iran .
Developing countries with a large proportion of oil exports are at increased risk of instability through three mechanisms .
Firstly , revenue from oil exports motivates groups excluded from the profits or benefits to oppose the government .
Secondly , opposition to the government can be rewarding if it produces bribes or pay - offs .
Thirdly , oil in particular can enhance inequality through the â€˜Dutch diseaseâ€ ™ , in which currency inflow from the sale of hydrocarbons makes other products less competitive for export , so weakening manufacturing and increasing prices for consumers .
Although the nuclear deal will increase the flow of revenue to the Iranian government , it is at core an arms control agreement that will not lead to other reforms .
It is true that a significant constraint on economic growth has been removed with the lifting of many sanctions .
It might even provide the beginning of a long - term path forward for Iran in convincing western Europe ,
Iranâ€ ™ s neighbours , Argentina , Brazil and the US
that it is no longer a pariah state .
But as John Maynard Keynes said : â€œIn the long run weâ€ ™ re all deadâ€ � .
Economic reform under the Rouhani administration is unlikely .

2016-01-18,"The lifting of sanctions on Iran on Saturday marks a new era in bilateral relations between Tehran and Washington , one of the countryâ€ ™ s vice - presidents has said , adding that further rapprochement is contingent on how the US goes about fulfilling its commitments under last summerâ€ ™ s nuclear accord .
In an interview with the Guardian , Masoumeh Ebtekar warned against what she said were new attempts in the region to create a sense of â€œIranophobiaâ€ � , though she did not single out by name
Tehranâ€ ™ s regional rival , Saudi Arabia .
Ebtekar , a close ally of President Hassan Rouhani , hailed the removal of sanctions as â€œa success of diplomacy and negotiationâ€ � and said it was a very strong indication that with the necessary will â€œwe can resolve many of the outstanding international conflicts , without resorting to force and violenceâ€ � .
She hoped the implementation of the landmark nuclear deal would have a positive impact on the Syria talks , which have hit a stalemate .
â€œWe saw initially a couple of weeks ago some positive developments in regards to Syria with a lot of hope .
I think we should look forward to a more positive role both for Iran but for all those looking forward to finding peaceful solution to issues like Syria and Yemen , because the ongoing conditions in Yemen are also terrible.â€ � Ebtekar , who is also the head of Iranâ€ ™ s environmental protection organisation , played a high - profile role during the 1979 Islamic revolution by serving as the spokeswoman for the Iranian students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days .
Six years spent in Philadelphia before the revolution accounts for her fluent , American - accented English .
Ebtekar , a prominent reformist figure , became Iranâ€ ™ s first woman vice - president when she previously served in the same office from 1997 to 2005 .
Many of the revolutionary students who were involved in the infamous hostage crisis then became prominent reformist figures , advocating better relations with the west .
Some , including the architect of the attack Ebrahim Asgharzadeh , have spent time in jail for their views .
The formal lifting of sanctions on Saturday has in effect reconnected Tehran to the global economy after a decade of complex , punitive measures .
The Swift international transaction facilitator said on Sunday that Iranian banks were automatically reconnected to the worldâ€ ™ s banking system .
On Monday , senior officials at Iranâ€ ™ s oil ministry said the authorities had ordered an increase of half a million barrels per day as an embargo on Iranian oil was lifted .
The increase in Tehranâ€ ™ s crude exports will affect the global oil market , already struck by plummeting price as the result of oversupply .
Ebtekar said she was at a film festival at Milad tower in Tehran late on Saturday when it was announced that the sanctions were going to be lifted .
â€œPeople were truly content and there was a feeling of jubilation , â€ �
she said .
â€œWhat Iâ€ ™ m seeing over the social networks is that there is a lot of hope , a lot of optimism , and a lot of energy to move ahead.â€ �
She said Americaâ€ ™ s conduct in the post - sanctions era would determine whether there were more scope to further relax bilateral ties .
â€œI think this is a new era for sure , â€ � she said .
Asked about the prospects of having a US secretary of state visiting Tehran for the first time since the revolution , Ebtekar said : â€œI think itâ€ ™ s very important to see how the US moves ahead in terms of implementing the agreement in different aspects and dimensions .
â€œThere is a lot of enthusiasm on the part of American companies and private sector , looking forward to working with Iran .
I also think there is a lot of enthusiasm on the part of the academics and private sectors [ in Iran ] .
I think there will be a lot of public diplomacy , but perhaps also a lot of tourists coming and going.â€ �
There are deep suspicions in the Iranian establishment over how the US is committed to improve relations .
Officials in Iran strongly protested at the announcement in Washington that the US was imposing more sanctions because of Iranâ€ ™ s ballistic missile programme just a day after the lifting of nuclear - related sanctions .
American companies interested in entering the Iranian market are also impeded by previous sanctions related to terrorism .
A large number of Iranians , and not solely those sympathetic to the establishment , are particularly angry about a recent US congress legislation that punishes those Europeans and dual Iranians who have visited Iran , depriving them of the previously available visa waiver programme .
The new legislation means a British national who has travelled to Iran over the course of past five years will no longer be able to visit the US without a visa .
Sanctions took a toll on Iranâ€ ™ s economy , including the environmental sector , she said .
â€œThey took a toll in many respects , particularly in regards to the new technologies that we require in areas like protection and preservation of our water resources , proper use of water in the sustained agricultural sector , protection of our rivers , wetlands , our lakes.â€ � Iran was facing a serious water challenge , like other countries in the region , but Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government had allocated a national environmental fund to deal with the issue , as well as curbing greenhouse gas emissions .
â€œWe need access to technologies not only in the refineries to produce high quality fuel but also in the automative sector â€ “
a city like Tehran has five million passenger cars and motorcycles and a lot of them are now obsolete , they have to be changed to modern standards vehicles ,
â€ � she said .
On Monday , the German carmaker Daimler said it had signed letters of understanding with local partners to return its truck business to Iran , six years after sanctions interrupted its activity .
Iran has a huge car market and French manufacturers , including Peugeot and Renault , are also considering a comeback .
Ebtekar said the next most important issue facing Rouhaniâ€ ™ s administration is Februaryâ€ ™ s parliamentary election and also the election of the next council of experts on the same day .
On Sunday , as Iranians woke up to a first day without sanctions in years , hardliners in Iran struck the first blow against Rouhani by disqualifying a significant number of moderate and reformist candidates in the vetting process .
The Guardian Council , which vets candidates before any election in Iran , was reported to have approved the candidacy of only 40 % of candidates .
Some reports suggested only 30 out of 3,000 reformist figures who had registered were allowed to run , which means only 1 % of the reformists have been approved .
Iranâ€ ™ s sole outspoken member of the current parliament , Ali Motahari , is among those disqualified .
The candidacy of a grandson of the founder of the Islamic republic was also reportedly rejected .
â€œThere are concerns over the vetting process of the Guardian Council now and we hope that we can overcome those concerns , â€ � Ebtekar said .
â€œ[Everyone ] is looking forward to an election that could have fair and free competition , thatâ€ ™ s the most important issue that we have ahead .
The government is looking forward to making sure these elections are conducted properly according to law and according to the principles that we have for the democratic prospects of the country.â€ �
When asked about rising tensions between Tehran and Riyadh over the Saudi execution of a prominent Shia , which led to the storming of the Saudi embassy in Iran , Ebtekar said Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government had a policy of alleviating tensions .
Tehran and Riyadh are at odds over a number of bruising conflicts in the region , including the war in Yemen and the fate of Syriaâ€ ™ s president Bashar al - Assad .
â€œI think that Iran has proven now , particularly during the government of Dr Rouhani , that it has good intentions for all of its neighbours and is working to promote peace and security , â€ �
she said .
â€œ[There are ] attempts that are being made to create a sense of Iranophobia .
There is nothing to fear about Iran , which is an independent state in the region .
While it is fully prepared to defend itself it is also fully prepared to work with its neighbours for peace , for prosperity and improving relations.â€ �"
2016-01-18,"Western businesses are jockeying for investment opportunities in Iran as the country regains access to the global financial system following the lifting of sanctions at the weekend .
Russian investment firm Renaissance Capital has described Iran as â€œthe last remaining sizeable global economy cut off from international capital to reopenâ€ � .
The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , said on Sunday that 150 companies from 50 countries had recently visited Iran for investment .
Local media quoted Abbas Akhondi , the minister for roads and urban development , as saying that Iran had struck a deal with the French company Airbus for the purchase of 114 new planes , estimated to be worth more than $ 10bn ( Â£7bn ) .
On Monday the German automotive firm Daimler said it had signed letters of understanding with local partners to return its truck business to Iran , six years after sanctions interrupted its activity .
Iran has a huge car market and French manufacturers including Peugeot and Renault are also considering a comeback .
International business leaders mulling ways to sell their products in the Middle Eastâ€ ™ s second largest economy have already embarked on fact - finding missions .
But the lifting of sanctions , which came into effect on Saturday after the implementation of last summerâ€ ™ s landmark nuclear deal , gives the business community the green light to exchange money .
Iranian banks have also reconnected to the European financial system via Swift , which facilitates international transactions .
Germany , France and Italy are leading the pack as Europe aims to increase trade with Iran from the current level of â‚¬7.6bn ( Â£5.8bn ) to the pre - sanctions figure of almost â‚¬28bn .
In the short to medium term , Chinaâ€ ™ s president , Xi Jinping , is to visit Tehran next week , and the British chancellor , George Osborne , and Germanyâ€ ™ s economy minister , Sigmar Gabriel , are planning to take trade delegations to Iran in May.
Rouhani is expected in Rome and Paris soon . .
Ramin Rabii , chief executive of Turquoise Partners , which manages more than 90 % of all existing foreign portfolio investment on the Tehran stock exchange ( TSE ) , underlined Iranâ€ ™ s business potential .
â€œThe implementation of the nuclear deal has brought about a new era for the Iranian economy and its investment potential , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œIran has a young and sophisticated population , is rich in energy and mineral resources and has a well - diversified economy with a widespread industrial base .
With the re - emergence of Iran and its reintegration into the global economy , Iran can potentially be the engine for regional and perhaps even global economic growth in the next five to 10 years.â€
� Esfandyar Batmanghelidj , founder of the Europe - Iran Forum business conferences series , was critical of those in the west predicting a â€œgold rushâ€ � .
He said : â€œThis misunderstands the real nature of the Iran opportunity , which is not so much about foreigners flocking to Iran to trade and invest , but about a new ability for Iranians to invest in their own economy â€ ¦ as they eye global markets .
â€œHistorically , gold rushes are fleeting and exploitative .
I think Iranians are hoping implementation day leads not to a gold rush but to a golden age , and itâ€ ™ s their efforts that will make it
so.â€
� Rabii predicts the Iranian economy will grow at a rate of 6 - 8 % in the coming years .
â€œThere has been a lot of media attention on the oil and gas sector but there is a lot more to the Iranian economy than the energy sector , â€ � he said .
The petroleum sector constitutes only 15 % of Iranian GDP and 30 % of the governmentâ€ ™ s annual income .
Iran is expected to immediately add half a million barrels per day to its crude exports , which will have an impact on plummeting prices and a global oil market already under pressure due to oversupply .
â€œIt is hard to say how this deal will impact the average
personâ€ ™ s pocket in the next month or even a year , but I can tell with confidence that this is potentially a turning point for the Iranian economy which will create value for Iran and will improve the quality of life of its citizens in the medium to long term , â€ � Rabii said .
â€œFrom an investment and business perspective , Iran is the market of the future .
Iran may not be the best performing market of the next year , but I will bet my money that it will be the best performing market of the next decade.â€

Alstom , the French electricity generation and rail transport company , is seeking contracts to work on the expansion of the metro in Tehran and building two more lines in the city of Mashhad , as well as participating in the electrification of the 600-mile ( 1,000 km ) Tehran - Mashhad railway .
The French industrial group Bouygues and AÃ © roports de Paris are also in talks with Iran to construct the countryâ€ ™ s largest transport project , the second terminal at Tehranâ€ ™ s Imam Khomeini international airport ."
2016-01-23,"After years out in the diplomatic cold , Iran has officially entered the post - sanctions era .
Hassan Rouhani , Iranâ€ ™ s president , has hailed a â€œgolden pageâ€ � in the countryâ€ ™ s history and a â€œturning pointâ€ � in its economy during the first days without sanctions , amid warm reaction from international community .
Masoumeh Ebtekar , a prominent reformist figure who became Iranâ€ ™ s first woman vice - president when she previously served in her current office from 1997 to 2005 , praised â€œa success of diplomacy and negotiationâ€ � as she raised hopes for a new era in bilateral relations between Tehran and Washington .
But while the lifting of sanctions has become the main focus of mainstream media and will have a dramatic impact on life , with business activities boosted â€ “ though caveats remain â€ “ for Iranians and the diaspora there is much more to life in the Islamic Republic .
Away from politics we know about food and drink ( thereâ€ ™ s a strong case to say Iranians make the best tea in the world and its cuisine is increasingly celebrated abroad ) and the artists who have already found ways to influence the world despite the diplomatic standoff .
The country is host to many unique cultural treasures largely unseen by western eyes , and many expect a sharp rise in tourism to Iran : only this month Unesco added two more ancient sites to its world heritage list .
Tell us about it If you are in Iran , or are part of the Iranian diaspora living abroad , we want to hear what it means to you to be Iranian and what parts of Iranian culture , for too long closed off to the world , should be celebrated .

2016-01-25,"Hassan Rouhani is to make the first state visit to Europe by an Iranian president in almost two decades this week , following the lifting of sanctions against his country .
The trip will aim at rebuilding economic ties and Iran is expected to sign a deal with Airbus for 114 new aircraft .
Europe was Iranâ€ ™ s largest trading partner before sanctions , and has sent an unprecedented number of business delegations to the country since the landmark nuclear agreement with the west was sealed in July .
The end of sanctions , including the removal of EUâ€ ™ s embargo on Iranian oil imports , means that trade can begin again .
Rouhani is expected in Rome on Monday , where he will meet the Italian prime minister , Matteo Renzi .
He will also meet Pope Francis at the Vatican .
He will then travel to Paris on Wednesday and is scheduled to be welcomed by the French president , FranÃ§ois Hollande , at the ElysÃ © e palace on Thursday .
Germany , Italy and France have been leading the pack as Europe aims to increase trade with Tehran from the current level of â‚¬7.6bn ( Â£5.8bn ) a year to the pre - sanctions figure of almost â‚¬28bn .
Iranâ€ ™ s minister for roads and urban development , Abbas Akhondi , has been quoted as saying that the country is in talks with Airbus for the purchase of 114 new aircraft .
Tehran has long said it will need to revamp an ageing fleet , hit by a shortage of parts because of trade bans imposed by Washington and other western powers .
Mahdi Hashemi , the chairman of the Iranian parliamentâ€ ™ s development commission , said this weekend that the country may need as many as 500 new planes over the next three years .
Rouhani was initially expected in Europe in November , but his visit was cancelled at the last minute after the Paris attacks .
It will be Rouhaniâ€ ™ s first official visit to Europe and the first by an Iranian head of government since 1999 , when the reformist former president Mohammad Khatami made similar trips to Paris and Rome .
Iran is a huge market for French car manufacturers , which are eager to do business in the country again .
Peugeot used to sell 400,000 vehicles a year in Iran before sanctions were put in place .
An arrangement with the local manufacturer Iran Khodro , which assembled the vehicles , meant its cars were ubiquitous across the country .
Local media reported this weekend that Iran Khodro could finalise a new deal worth â‚¬500 m with Peugeot during Rouhaniâ€ ™ s visit to France .
â€œPeugeot 2008 crossover , 208 supermini and 301 compact cars will be manufactured inside Iran under the 50 - 50 joint venture , â€ � according to the semi - official Tasnim news , which quoted an anonymous Iranian official .
Other French companies , including Alstom , the electricity generation and rail transport firm , the industrial group Bouygues and AÃ
© roports de Paris are also interested in engaging Iran in the post - sanctions era .
â€œThe Rouhani administration is counting on sanctions relief resulting in economic improvements , and if possible , before next monthâ€ ™ s parliamentary elections , â€ � said Timothy Stafford , a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute ( RUSI ) .
â€œHowever , there is a danger that it will over - promise and under - deliver .
International businesses will think very carefully about the risks of returning to the Iranian market , and even if they do , it will take a long time for the economic benefits of increased trade and investment to be felt , â€ � he said .
â€œIn addition , it is still possible that some of the nuclear - related sanctions that are being lifted will be reimposed for other reasons in the coming months .
That is how the US has decided to respond to the ballistic missile tests Iran conducted late last year.â€ � Five things to watch during Rouhaniâ€ ™
s
visit Meeting with Pope Francis
The pope strongly advocated a peaceful resolution to the crisis over Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
He intervened directly , urging Congress not to sabotage the accord during his visit to the US last year , a move that was welcomed by Tehran .
Business talks at Medef ,
Franceâ€ ™ s main business confederation Rouhani is expected to meet Medefâ€ ™ s president , Pierre Gattaz .
A number of Iranian ministers , including the oil minister , Bijan Zanganeh , are accompanying the president during his visit .
Oil executives from Total and other French business leaders are also expected to meet Rouhani .
No lunch at the ElysÃ © e Rouhani is expected to attend a dinner for Iranian expatriates in Paris , but a lunch reception at the palace , which is usual for state visits , is unlikely to take place because of Iranâ€ ™ s insistence on a longstanding diplomatic protocol that its officials should not participate in events where wine is served .
Fight against Isis Rouhani will present his country as a key regional player when it comes to the conflict in Syria .
Iran , an ally of Bashar al - Assadâ€ ™ s regime since the conflict started in 2011 , argues that the west should prioritise the fight against Islamic State and roll back from its position that the Syrian leader must step down as part of any solution .
How much he will succeed remains to be seen .
The reaction of European banks Despite the lifting of sanctions and the desire among European businesses to enter Iran , the continentâ€ ™ s major banks are still reluctant to handle Iranian payments .
The US Federal Reserve has issued a 50-page guidance document that says EU banks can now do business with Iran provided they refrain from dealing with certain entities and individuals still blacklisted under sanctions relating to terrorism and human rights .
Banks , however , are not yet fully reassured and some say the guidance is open to interpretation ."
2016-01-26,"Italian officials keen to spare the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , any possible offence on his visit to Rome covered up nude statues at the cityâ€ ™ s Capitoline Museum , where Rouhani met Matteo Renzi , the Italian prime minister .
Photographs of Mondayâ€ ™ s visit show both men standing near a grand equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius , the Roman emperor .
Nude statues in the vicinity were covered by large white panels .
A spokesman for Renzi did not immediately return a request for comment .
A spokesman for the city of Rome , which manages the museum , said any decision regarding the ceremony with Rouhani and display of artwork had been made by the prime ministerâ€ ™ s office .
The decision to cover the artwork was seen as a sign of respect for the Iranian president , according to the Italian news agency Ansa .
Not everyone agreed .
â€œRespect for other cultures can not and must not mean negating our own , â€ � said Luca Squeri , a lawmaker in Silvio
Berlusconiâ€ ™ s centre - right Forza Italia party .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t respect , itâ€ ™ s cancelling out differences and
itâ€ ™ s a kind of surrender.â€ �
In another placatory gesture by Italian officials , alcohol was not served at an official dinner held in Rouhaniâ€ ™ s honour , abiding by a standard diplomatic gesture for visiting Muslim dignitaries .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s visit to Europe â€ “ his first since sanctions were lifted in Iran â€ “ was supposed to take place in November but was delayed following the Paris terror attacks .
On Tuesday , he had a private meeting with Pope Francis and other top church officials where the two leaders held â€œcordialâ€ � talks , the Vatican said , adding that the two men shared â€œcommon spiritual valuesâ€ � .
While the meeting was rare , it was not unprecedented .
The last meeting between a pope and Iranian head of state took place in 1999 and the Vatican has long maintained diplomatic relations with Iran even as the republic was shunned by much of the western world .
The two leaders discussed the conclusion and implementation of the nuclear deal - which Pope Francis strongly endorsed - and the important role Iran and other countries in the Middle East play in seeking â€œpolitical solutionsâ€ � to the problems that plague the region , as well as stopping the spread of terrorism and arms trafficking .
The meeting lasted about 40 minutes and included an exchange of gifts .
The pope received a hand - made carpet from the city of Qom and a book of reproductions by painter Mahmoud Farshchian , while Rouhani was given a medallion of St Martin and copies of the popeâ€ ™ s encyclical on the environment , in English and Arabic .
â€œI
thank you very much for the visit .
I have high hopes in peace , â€ � the pope told Rouhani , according to the Catholic News Service .
Rouhani responded by asking the pope to pray for him .
Rouhani is set to visit Romeâ€ ™ s other big attraction on Wednesday with a planned trip to the Coliseum , which he will visit with Italyâ€ ™ s culture minister , Dario Franceschini .
Europe was Iranâ€ ™ s largest trading partner before the imposition of sanctions .
More than 100 Italian executives met top Iranian officials during the Rome visit , and Italian infrastructure companies agreed to at least â‚¬17bn of deals and investments .
It was not the first time that Renzi â€ “ a Florentine who is usually a proud advocate for Italyâ€ ™ s rich cultural heritage
â€ “ has sought to be culturally sensitive in a high - stakes meeting .
In October , a cordon was placed around a nude statue by the American artist Jeff Koons during a visit to Florence by Renzi and Mohammed bin Zayed bin Sultan al - Nahyan , the crown prince of Abu Dhabi .
It was noted at the time that another sculpture â€ “ Michelangeloâ€ ™ s David â€ “ remained uncovered throughout ."
2016-01-27,"Hassan Rouhaniâ€ ™ s historic visit to France , which began on Wednesday afternoon , is set to be dominated by business talks between the Iranian presidentâ€ ™ s 100-strong trade delegation and French CEOs , most notably over a multibillion - dollar contract for the purchase of 114 Airbus planes .
But on a personal level for Rouhani the visit will stir memories from more than three and a half decades ago when his political career began in earnest in exile in a suburban area west of Paris .
In 1978 the law graduate and outspoken critic of the shah joined Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini in Neauphle - le - ChÃ¢teau , from where Khomeini stirred up a revolution 3,000 miles away thanks to a network of devout supporters who used cassette tapes and photocopiers to spread his message .
Rouhani returned to Tehran in 1979 , entered parliament after the revolution and very soon became an ultimate insider , serving in critical roles at the time of war with Iraq .
Now 67 , Rouhani returns to France as a moderate and reform - seeking president who wants to rebuild economic ties following the lifting of sanctions , and to revamp Iranâ€ ™ s image in Europe after the acrimonious years of his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It is the first state visit to France by an Iranian president in 17 years .
Rouhani arrives from Italy , where he paid a state visit to Rome and the Vatican , meeting Pope Francis
. â€œIran is the safest , the most stable country in the entire region , â€ �
Rouhani said in Rome .
â€œEveryone understood that the nuclear negotiations represented a win - win situation for both sides .
There has to be an advantage for both sides : we invite you to invest and we will provide stability and ensure that you can make adequate returns.â€ �
In Paris , the Iranian president will meet French business leaders and host a dinner reception with expatriate Iranians .
It was not clear whether his tight schedule would allow him to also visit Neauphle - le - ChÃ¢teau .
On Thursday the president will be welcomed by the French foreign minister , Laurent Fabius , at Les Invalides .
He will then lead a business meeting at Medef , Franceâ€ ™ s main business confederation , in the presence of the French prime minister , Manuel Valls , and will speak at Ifri , the French institute of international relations , which has a strong presence in Tehran .
Rouhani is due to meet the French president , FranÃ§ois Hollande , at the ElysÃ
© e Palace in the afternoon .
Unlike other state visits to France , there will be no lunch reception at the ElysÃ © e because of Iranâ€ ™ s insistence on a longstanding diplomatic protocol that its officials should not participate in events where wine is served .
In Rome , Italian officials sought to be culturally sensitive by covering up nude statues at the cityâ€ ™ s Capitoline Museum , where Rouhani met Matteo Renzi , the Italian prime minister .
Iran has said it did not request the cover - up .
Business talks will dominate the visit .
Europe was Iranâ€ ™ s largest trading partner before sanctions , and aims to increase trade with Tehran from the current level of â‚¬7.6bn ( Â£5.8bn ) a year to the pre - sanctions figure of almost â‚¬28bn .
Iran is a big market for French companies . .
Peugeot is reported to be finalising a deal worth â‚¬500 m ( Â£380 m ) with the local manufacturer Iran Khodro .
Iran has the largest car market in the Middle East and Peugeot and Renault are eager to resume sales in Iran .
Ellie Geranmayeh , a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank , said Rouhaniâ€ ™ s trip to France was much more about business than diplomacy .
â€œThis is good for Tehran because it needs to boost trade , and it is good for Paris , because so long as itâ€ ™ s just business with Iran rather than a major political shift , they wonâ€ ™ t endanger their advantageous position vis - a - vis Saudi Arabia , â€ �
she said .
â€œPolitically , France and the Islamic Republic of Iran endorse very different systems of governance and often find themselves at idealogical odds with one another .
But when it comes to doing business they speak a similar language and can agree to disagree on the politics .
French companies , like many other European companies , are not starting from scratch in Iran , they have a wide long - sustained network base inside the country.â€ �
While political relations between Iran and France are likely to continue their current course towards a rapprochement , Geranmayeh said there would not be overnight normalisation .
â€œThe two countries are far apart on the Assad question when it comes to the Syrian conflict â€ “ in some ways even more apart that the US and Iran .
In recent years , France has solidified its security and economic links with Saudi Arabia , Iranâ€ ™ s regional rival , and so Paris will be careful not to damage this special relationship .
But there is growing political space for France and Iran to engage constructively in Lebanon , a country whose stability is important for both sides and where the government in Beirut remains paralysed.â€
�
Franceâ€ ™ s influence is felt keenly in Iranian culture .
The Iranian intelligentsia is influenced by French intellectual movements , and French cinema is very popular .
French literature , such as works by Marcel Proust , Gustave Flaubert and Stendhal , has been translated into Persian and continues to be read .
Flaubertâ€ ™ s Sentimental Education , which is almost forgotten in English , is widely read in Persian .
On Franceâ€ ™ s side , post - revolutionary Iranian cinema is widely celebrated , and a number of Iranian film - makers , including the Cannes - winning Abbas Kiarostami , are well known .
The Iranian actor Golshifteh Farahani , who has fallen foul of the Iranian authorities after posing nude for the French magazine Madam Figaro , is in exile in Paris .
France is home to a large number of Iranian exiles , including the former queen Farah Pahlavi , and Abdulhassan Banisadr ,
Iranâ€ ™ s first post - revolutionary president , who was impeached in June 1981 .
Maryam Rajavi , the leader of the radical exiled group MEK , which was listed as terrorist organisation by the US and the UK until recently , is also based in France .
MEK has opposed the nuclear deal and repeatedly holds rallies in Europe and the US against Iranian leaders .
Critics of the MEK say it has a political agenda and has used human rights grounds to denounce any rapprochement by the west with the Islamic Republic .
Iran has a history of executing MEK members and sentencing its supporters to lengthy jail terms ."
2016-01-27,"For most tourists , it would be the ultimate irritation : visiting one of Italyâ€ ™ s most famous museums , only to find famous exhibits hidden by wooden boxes .
But this week , Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , apparently enjoyed his time at the Capitoline Museum , despite the fact that many of the artworks were covered up before his trip .
Conscientious Italian officials had taken the precaution of concealing nude statues for the first visit in a decade by an Iranian politician â€ “ albeit a moderate one â€ “ in a bid to be culturally sensitive .
Not everyone was quite so thrilled , with some Italian critics complaining the decision to conceal some of the more risque artworks was a form of â€œcultural
submissionâ€ � .
But Rouhani denied he was behind the attempt to censor the cityâ€ ™ s cultural heritage , saying he appreciated the gesture .
â€œI know that Italians are a very hospitable people , a people who try to do the most to put their guests at ease and I thank you for this , â€ �
he said .
At dinner , the Italians were equally tactful â€ “ serving fish rather than non - halal meat , and not serving alcohol .
Itâ€ ™ s not the first time the Italian PM , Matteo Renzi , has shown such diplomatic sensitivity .
Last October , a Jeff Koons statue was cordoned off before the visit of Mohammed bin Zayed bin Sultan al - Nahyan , the crown prince of Abu Dhabi .
Nor is it just Muslim leaders who get squeamish about being near scantily clad statues .
In 2002 , the US justice department spent $ 8,000 on curtains , apparently in a bid to cover up the 12 ft , partially clothed Spirit of Justice statue .
The attorney general at the time , John Ashcroft , was said to be sick of photographers capturing his head in front of the statueâ€ ™ s bare breast , although the department said Ashcroft was not involved in the decision .
Not all European countries have been as accommodating as Italy .
In France , where halal meat has become a divisive topic and some schools have stopped providing Muslim and Jewish schoolchildren with alternatives to pork for school dinners , a lunch meeting between FranÃ§ois Hollande and Rouhani was apparently cancelled over a request from the Iranians to avoid serving alcohol and to serve halal food .
Reports suggest the French tried to change the meeting to breakfast - time instead , which the Iranians promptly rejected because it appeared too â€œcheapâ€ � .
In 2009 , a similar controversy with Nuri al - Maliki led to Iraqâ€ ™ s then prime minister declining a dinner invitation from Nicolas Sarkozy because he did not want alcohol at the table .
In contrast , the emir of Qatar and the Saudi king have agreed to dinners in France where wine was served in opaque carafes , but then complained .
If this seems like a storm in a teacup , the French are reported to have had their own spats over what refreshments are acceptable â€ “ Franceâ€ ™ s current ambassador to the UK , Sylvie - Agnes Bermann , is said to have complained when a group of diplomats she brought to the House of Commons were served only tea and biscuits by the teetotal shadow foreign affairs spokesman Hilary Benn ."
2016-01-28,"Iranâ€ ™ s president has told his French counterpart in a historic visit to the Ã‰lysÃ © e palace that Tehran was prepared to â€œturn the pageâ€ � in bilateral relations after the â€œresentmentâ€ � of sanctions as he sought to reintroduce his country in Europe two weeks after implementation of the landmark nuclear deal .
Hassan Rouhani was welcomed by FranÃ§ois Hollande at the French presidential residence earlier on Thursday during the first official visit by an Iranian president to the French capital in 17 years .
â€œLet us forget the resentment , â€ � the Iranian president said at the press conference with Hollande .
â€œWe are ready to turn the page.â€ �
Hollande responded : â€œItâ€ ™ s a new chapter of our relationship .
I want that relationship to be useful , useful to both countries , useful to the region [ Middle East ] affected by wars , crises and tragedies.â€ �
The two - hour meeting at the Ã‰lysÃ © e finished with the announcement of the signing of a set of lucrative contracts between Iranian officials and French companies , worth billions of euros .
Among them was a deal struck with Airbus for the purchase of 118 new commercial passenger planes .
The car manufacturer Peugeot also signed a contract with the Iranian car company Iran Khodro for a joint venture worth â‚¬400 m .
French oil company Total also signed a contract with the national Iranian oil company to buy crude oil .
Iran is adding an extra 500,000 barrels per day to its exports following the lifting of sanctions .
The construction firm Vinci also signed a contract to develop Tehranâ€ ™ s main international airport .
Both leaders said the fight against terrorism was a priority but responded diplomatically on the issue of Syria , over which they have strong disagreements .
â€œWe must fight terrorism â€
¦
We must help the Syrian people so that the Syrian people can build a sustainable future for the country ,
â€ �
Rouhani said .
â€œThe main problem in Syria is not such and such person , the main issue is terrorism and Daesh , â€ �
he added , regarding the fate of Bashar al - Assad , whom Tehran strongly supports .
Hollande said : â€œTerrorism is our sole enemy.â€ �
In the morning , Rouhani delivered a major speech at Medef , Franceâ€ ™ s main pro - business confederation in the presence of the French prime minister , Manuel Valls , and top French CEOs .
The Iranian president said there was a clear sign that French companies were welcome to Tehran .
â€œFrance has announced that it is ready to once again enter Iran with a new energy and a new will .
We have also come here today to welcome French entrepreneurs , investors to begin economic activities in Iran , â€ �
Rouhani told the business leaders .
Valls replied that Iran could count on France .
Since Rouhaniâ€ ™ s arrival in Paris on Wednesday afternoon , Iranian officials held a series of closed - doors meetings in the hotel where he was staying .
He was accompanied at the Medef gathering by a large number of his cabinet members , including the oil minister , Bijan Zanganeh .
Valls said the French government was encouraging the business sector to take up opportunities in Iran .
â€œWe can open a new chapter ,
â€ �
he said at Medef , addressing Rouhani .
â€œFrance is ready to mobilise its business sector â€ ¦ for modernisation of your country .
I want to put it in a few simple but strong words : Iran can count on France.â€ �
Rouhani said the lifting of sanctions with the implementation of the nuclear deal two weeks ago had paved the way for an improvement in economic ties .
â€œWhat we experienced under sanctions was a lose - lose situation that was the result of a wrong policy , a wrong policy that hurt everyone â€ ¦
but today we should seize the opportunity of the era after sanctions ,
â€ � he said .
â€œFrance doesnâ€ ™ t need any permission from any other country [ to enter business with Iran ] and itâ€ ™ s not receiving orders from above and thatâ€ ™ s very important for us.â€ � Medefâ€ ™ s president , Pierre Gattaz , said French businesses had been impressed by the quality of the relations with their Iranian interlocutors .
â€œThis new era is already under way .
The Iranian door has always been open to French companies.â€ �
Also on the stage at Medef was Mohsen Jalalpour , the head of Iranâ€ ™ s chamber of commerce , industries , mines and agriculture .
In an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday , Jalalpour said Rouhaniâ€ ™ s administration had prioritised the private sector .
â€œSanctions were a bitter experience for Iran , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œThe lesson was that we canâ€ ™ t only rely on having relations with half of the world and not care about the other half .
For over eight decades , Iran has been heavily dependent on oil and the government has played a big role in the economy but this administration is pursuing a new approach.â€ � Alstom , the French electricity generation and rail transport firm , is seeking contracts to work on an expansion of the metro in Tehran and to build two more lines in the city of Mashhad and participate in the electrification of the 600-mile Tehran - Mashhad railway .
The French industrial group Bouygues and AÃ © roports
de Paris are in talks with Iran to construct the countryâ€ ™ s largest transport project , the second terminal at Tehranâ€ ™ s Imam Khomeini international airport .
â€œAlstom is mobilised to participate in the development of transport infrastructure in Iran thanks to our long successful history with this country and its new focus on railway activities , â€ �
Philippe Delleur , senior vice - president at Alstom , told the Guardian .
â€œIt covers both urban transport and mainlines.â€ �
Alisher Ali , chairman of Silk Road Finance , an investment group focused on Iran and Eurasian countries , said : â€œPresident Rouhaniâ€ ™
s
visit to Europe and signing numerous multibillion - euro deals with leading European companies was a strong testimony to Iranâ€ ™ s keen desire to boost its economy with massive modernisation and technological upgrade of its key industries including oil and gas , transportation and infrastructure.â€ �
He added : â€œI believe Iran with its huge pent - up demand and investment requirements represents a unique growth opportunity for many European and international companies .
I reckon there will be a wave of European companies actively entering the Iranian market starting from this year.â€ �"
2016-01-28,"The official in charge of ceremonies in the office of the Italian prime minister is suffering criticism and ridicule after she was blamed for the controversial decision to cover up nude statues during the visit of the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani .
The decision to cover the statues in the Capitoline Museum in Rome â€ “ which on Monday night hosted a joint press appearance by Rouhani and the Italian PM , Matteo Renzi â€ “ has nearly overshadowed the historic first visit by an Iranian leader to Europe since sanctions against Iran were lifted .
The Italian media is now closely examining the record of Ilva Sapora , the 64-year - old allegedly to blame for the PR debacle , whose career is said to have been compromised by the decision .
The culture minister , Dario Franceschini , eager to distance himself from the figuraccia , or poor showing , has said that neither he nor the prime minister had personally been consulted on the decision , which he called â€œincomprehensibleâ€ � .
But other officials have said Renziâ€ ™ s office was responsible for the affair , and the spotlight has therefore landed on Sapora .
She is now being blamed for a host of other apparent gaffes in recent months that have allegedly made Renziâ€ ™ s blood boil .
Among a list of ceremonial shortcomings and mistakes , an article in newspaper La Stampa claimed that Sapora does not speak fluent English , despite having to deal with many international delegations .
The newspaper also suggested that she was involved in the accidental exclusion of a top Kuwaiti general at a dinner for a Kuwaiti minister last year following the signing of a major defence deal .
The omission had put the deal at risk , La Stampa said .
Sapora , who could not be reached by the Guardian but told La Stampa she would not comment , has also been criticised over an incident in which Italian diplomats were alleged by the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano to have accepted gifts of expensive Rolex watches despite an Italian laws that bars them from accepting such lavish presents .
While government figures such as Franceschini have sought to distance themselves from the controversy surrounding the covered statues , Renzi has nevertheless been roundly criticised by his rightwing opponents , who have characterised the move as a desperate act of capitulation .
The far right party Fratelli dâ€ ™ Italia tweeted a manufactured image of St Peterâ€ ™ s Basilica clad in cardboard and suggested that Renzi planned to cover it up to avoid offending the emir of Qatar in an upcoming visit .
One of the reasons Italyâ€ ™ s decision to cover the statues was so heavily scrutinised is because of the sharp contrast with Franceâ€ ™ s reluctance to abide by the same diplomatic rules .
France reportedly scoffed at an Iranian request that wine not be served at a state dinner with Rouhani , which was then cancelled .
In the event , the whole of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s planned trip to Paris in November was delayed following the terrorist attacks on the city .
The controversy had overshadowed the fact that Iran signed nearly â‚¬20bn in deals with Italy , said Gianni Riotta , an Italian journalist and former editor of Il Sole 24 Ore. â€œI am positive that the lady was the culprit , though her intentions were nice .
Itâ€ ™ s because they handled it in such a goofy way , â€ � he said .
â€œThis says far more about the strong strain of provincialism that is still in Italy than the accusation that we bend our knee to Islam , â€ � he said .
â€œThe French are also provincial , but they do everything their own way .
They think their food is the best in the world , their soccer is the best in the world .
Nobody blames the French for being
French.â€ �
Finally , he added , the frustrating aspect of the controversy was that it could have so easily been avoided by taking the Iranian president to any number of Roman locations where he would not have had to share the stage with a naked Venus .
Social media users in Iran also ridiculed the decision , with one user mocking up a version of the Mona Lisa with her hair covered , joking that that was how the Louvre in Paris was preparing for Rouhaniâ€ ™ s visit .
Another user suggested an alternative way to preserve the statuesâ€ ™ modesty ."
2016-02-26,"Iranians voted in unexpectedly large numbers on Friday in the first polls since last summerâ€ ™ s landmark nuclear agreement and the lifting of sanctions .
The election was a key test of whether supporters of Hassan Rouhani , the president , can gain ground from conservatives and anti - western hardliners .
Voting was extended for five hours in the evening because of what state TV described as a â€œrushâ€ � that caused shortages of ballot papers .
Experts say a high turnout â€ “ widely predicted to hit 70 % â€ “ will favour the Rouhani camp .
The president himself spoke of an â€œepicâ€ � turnout after casting his vote .
Polling stations across Tehran were busy into Friday evening , fuelling hopes for a good result for the reformist - moderate alliance and increased support for Rouhani in the 290-seat parliament , or Majlis .
A parallel contest is taking place for the assembly of experts , a clerical body whose 88 members have to choose the next supreme leader after the 76-year - old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
In Baharestan Square , a religious area near the capitalâ€ ™ s famous bazaar , a young couple emerged from a polling station to say that everyone they knew was voting â€ “ despite fears of apathy .
State TV broadcast pictures of queues of voters across the country
â€ “ emphasising its size and diversity from Kurdistan in the north to Baluchistan in the east .
Khamenei cast his ballot moments after the polls opened at 8 am , waving to a phalanx of cameras and urging citizens to follow his example .
â€œIt is our duty and our right to take part in these elections and thatâ€ ™ s why I came early in the morning , â€ � he said .
â€œMy advice to everybody who loves the Islamic Republic of Iran and our great nation is to try to vote very soon.â€ �
â€œTurnout has been very satisfactory so far , â€ � said Alireza Seyfan , supervising the vote in the Imam Hassan mosque in Narmak in east Tehran , as a couple of dozen people filled out their ballot papers
â€ “ each requiring a handwritten list of 30 candidates .
Papers have to be marked by a fingerprint and countersigned by a supervisor before being placed in a plastic box .
Crowds gathered in the winter sunshine on nearby Hafthoze Square , where a giant banner quoted Khamenei : â€œPeople should elect those who are not connected to the sources of wealth and power.â€ �
In Samangan , home to the former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , dozens waited outside the Great Mosque a good hour before polling began .
â€œThe economy and inflation are the main issue for me , â€ � said Farsheed , a 24-year - old bank employee .
He was backing the pro - Rouhani reformist â€œlist of hopeâ€ � of Mohammad Reza Aref , a former vice - president and ally of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , the Green Movement leaders whose victory in 2009 was â€œstolenâ€ � by Ahmadinejad â€ “ and who remain under house arrest .
Zahra , a mother of two teenage sons , was supporting the rival conservative list led by Gholam - Ali Haddad - Adel , a close confidant of Khamenei .
â€œI want him because he supports the supreme leader , â€ � said the 42-year - old , whose chief concern was youth employment .
Neither she nor her husband , Mortaza , had seen any improvement in the economy since the lifting of sanctions last month .
In Niavaran in opulent north Tehran , overlooked by the snowcapped Alborz mountains , 200 people queued up at lunchtime to vote at the Val - Fajr mosque , men and women in segregated lines straggling across the courtyard .
â€œThe most important thing for me is to stop the radical right getting into the Majlis , â€ � explained Nargis , a computer programmer .
â€œWe hope that this time our votes will count â€ “ not like what happened in 2009.â€ �
Reformist supporters attach greater importance to parliament than to the assembly of experts , which has a built - in majority for conservatives .
Still , close attention is being paid to the performance of Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the former president , who has thrown his weight behind Rouhani .
Elsewhere crowds chanted the name of Mohammed Khatami , the highly regarded reformist president of the late 1990s , whose photograph is formally banned .
Iranian officials were keen to advertise the election as another reason for the outside world to engage with this country in the wake of the nuclear agreement .
â€œThis is a message to the west â€ “ that we have democracy based on Islamic values , â€ � said Ali Bakhsi , a foreign ministry employee who was waiting to casting his vote .
Students from Amir Kabir university expressed strong support for Rouhani â€ “ as well as scepticism about whether the vote would change much .
â€œIran is like a monarchy , â€ � said Namira , a 22-year - old theatre student , her hair barely covered by the required headscarf .
â€œInstead of a shah we have a supreme leader .
We have a Majlis , but it only has limited influence.â€ �
Others complained about the disqualification of hundreds of candidates .
â€œBut weaker reformists are still better than hardliners , â€ � an engineering student said .
â€œI am optimistic about the result , even though there have been a lot of limitations , â€ � the reformist commentator Saeed Laylaz told the Guardian .
â€œIn parliament we expect to make up a strong minority .
If we get 110 - 130 seats , that would be a victory .
The regime will realise that we are strong â€ “ in spite of all the propaganda by the conservatives.â€ �
In Ferdowsi Square , one poster was a reminder of the high tensions around the vote .
â€œEngland is trying to interfere in Iranâ€ ™ s elections , â€ � it said , over a picture of a camel with the face of the Queen .
No one is predicting trouble in the wake of the polls , though there is some nervousness in the reformist camp about the aftermath .
Several hundred foreign journalists who have been given rare visas to report on the elections have been ordered to leave by Sunday .
Press passes were carefully scrutinised by security personnel guarding polling stations .
Full results are expected early next week ."
2016-02-26,"Millions of Iranians have turned out to vote in the first polls since last summerâ€ ™ s landmark nuclear agreement and the lifting of sanctions .

2016-02-28,"Hardliners in Iran have been dealt a humiliating blow after reformist - backed candidates in Fridayâ€ ™ s hard - fought elections appeared on course for a sweeping victory in Tehran , with a combination of moderates and independents sympathetic to President Hassan Rouhani leading in provinces .
A coalition of candidates supported by the reformists , dubbed â€œthe list of hopeâ€ � , is likely to take all of the capitalâ€ ™ s 30 parliamentary seats , according to the latest tally released by the interior ministry , in surprising results seen as a strong vote of confidence in Rouhaniâ€ ™ s moderate agenda .
Mohammad Reza Aref , a committed reformist who has a degree from Stanford University in the US , is at the top of the list .
Preliminary results for the Assembly of Experts , which is responsible for appointing the next supreme leader , showed Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a key Rouhani ally , leading the race .
Elections to the assembly are usually a lacklustre event but have attracted huge attention this time because of the age of the current leader , 76-year - old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Khamenei and Rafsanjani , a prominent pragmatist who was not allowed to run for president in 2013 , have been at odds in recent years .
Results may not be finalised until Tuesday
but if they tally with the initial figures there will be a palpable change in the Iranian political landscape with moderates dominating the scene and hardliners being pushed back to the fringes .
Strong gains by supporters of Rouhani could help promote greater opening to the west by Iran and limit political advances by conservatives at home â€ “ and secure him a second term in office next year .
As many as 20 women are expected to win parliamentary seats , a record for Iran .
Among them is the reformist candidate Parvaneh Salahshori , who said in a recent foreign media interview that women should have a choice to wear the hijab .
The issue is a taboo subject in the Islamic Republic .
Although none of the competing factions would win a majority in the 290-seat majlis ( parliament ) , a combination of reformist - backed candidates , including some moderate conservatives and independents allied with Rouhani , are expected to outnumber conservatives .
Rouhani said on Twitter that he was holding his head high , adding that the big turnout had created â€œa new atmosphereâ€ � in the country .
A Twitter account believed to be run by Rafsanjaniâ€ ™ s office quoted him as saying that no one could resist the will of the people .
â€œThose not favoured by the people should leave , â€ � it said .
Rafsanjani was later quoted by the state IRNA news agency as calling for national unity .
â€œThe competition is over and the phase of unity and cooperation has arrived , â€ � he said .
â€œThe time after elections is the time for hard work to build the country.â€ �
The reformists have the upper hand not because they have more candidates entering the parliament â€ “
many were disqualified from running â€ “
but because of alliances with successful candidates from other camps .
Among those backed by reformists is Ali Motahari , who is culturally conservative but politically allied with moderates .
He is in second place in Tehran for a parliamentary seat , just after Aref .
Another conservative figure seen as sympathetic to Rouhani is Ali Larijani , the current speaker , who is on course to win in Qom , a city of religious shrines that has long been a conservative bastion .
Broader support in parliament would strengthen Rouhaniâ€ ™ s hand , However , key strategic decisions , such as Iranâ€ ™ s involvement in the Syrian conflict , still rest with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the ultimate power under Iranâ€ ™ s hybrid political system .
The reformistsâ€ ™ victory is a credit to Mohammad Khatami , the former president seen as the ultimate leader of the countryâ€ ™ s reformist movement .
Khatami has faced huge restrictions on his movement and activities in recent years but is leading from behind the scenes .
The Iranian media is banned from mentioning his name or publishing his photograph .
Khatami released a video online early in the campaign period urging political activists to unite behind â€œthe list of hopeâ€ � .
His call for support helped create huge momentum and the main opposition leader , who is under house arrest , and a number of prominent political prisoners also sent messages asking people to vote for the list .
The candidates who appear to have lost seats in both political bodies are as revealing as those who are set to win .
Gholam - Ali Haddad - Adel , a hardliner close to Khamenei , whose name topped the list of â€œprincipalistâ€ � candidates , is on course to lose his seat in the parliament .
In the race for the assembly , at least two ultra - conservative ayatollahs , Mohammad - Taghi Mesbah Yazdi and Mohammad Yazdi , the current chairman , are set to lose .
The elections were the first since Iranâ€ ™ s landmark nuclear agreement last summer and the lifting of sanctions in mid - January .
The short and carefully controlled campaign â€ “ marked by the prior disqualification of hundreds of candidates â€ “ was dominated by the state of the economy , which has improved in recent months though few tangible gains have trickled down to ordinary people .
â€œThe reformists and moderates have managed to take at least a third of the seats , â€ � said Sadegh Zibakalam , professor of politics at Tehran University .
Rafsanjaniâ€ ™ s success in the assembly was extremely important .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t say that the ultra - conservatives were defeated , but the conservatives canâ€ ™ t say they received a huge mandate , â€ � he added .
The precise shape of the next parliament will take time to emerge .
Because so many reformists and independents were disqualified , many candidates are unknown to the public and party lines and affiliations have become blurred , with some powerful conservative figures now backing Rouhani .
â€œSome of them are like watermelons , â€ � said Saeed Laylaz , a reformist political commentator .
â€œUntil you open them up you donâ€
™ t know
whatâ€ ™ s inside.â€ �"
2016-02-28,"The primary divide is now between supporters and opponents of the nuclear agreement Last Julyâ€ ™ s agreement with world powers brought a realignment in Iranian politics .
The central divide in the election was between supporters and opponents of the deal .
The â€˜principle - istâ€ ™ Ali Larijani as parliamentary speaker was an effective ally of President Hassan Rouhani .
Larijani headed off critics of the deal in a level of co - operation between parliament and government not seen during the presidency of Ahmadinejad and the latter years of Khatami .
During the election , public support offered to Larijani as candidate in Qom by General Qassem Soleimani , chief of the Revolutionary Guards overseas Qods brigade , reflected broad backing in the political elite behind the nuclear agreement .
This agreement was not consigned to history when signed .
Implementation is to last over the next nine years â€ “ both in limiting Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme and in removing United Nations , European Union and most United States sanctions .
This suggests the agreement will continue to shape Iranian politics , even if less strongly over time .
Iranian politics can not be reduced to â€˜reformistsâ€ ™ versus â€˜hardlinersâ€ ™ Iran is a large country â€ “ bigger than Iraq , Turkey and Syria combined â€ “ and every Iranian election throws up a complex mix of regional , tribal and local factors .
Voters have many reasons for voting as they do .
The single biggest issue in most elections in most countries is the economy - but this is a catch - all that can lump together jobs , prices , housing and urgent environmental issues like water management .
The generalisations of â€˜leftâ€ ™ versus â€˜rightâ€ ™ of the 1980s , and â€˜reformistsâ€ ™ versus â€˜conservativesâ€ ™ of the 1990s â€ “
however well they applied at the time â€ “ no longer work .
Observers who portrayed the elections as between â€˜reformistsâ€ ™ and â€˜hardlinersâ€ ™ have tied themselves in knots â€ “ as shown in reports that â€˜reformistsâ€ ™ and â€˜moderatesâ€ ™ had all been disqualified followed by reports they had won the election .
The succession to Ayatollah Khamenei as leader looks remarkably open With the defeat of Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi in the Experts Assembly election , the assembly will need a new chairman .
The assembly will remain an opaque body , but whoever fills the post ( as well as the conduct of his election ) will be the next clue as to how the succession to Khamenei will proceed .
The defeat in Tehran not just of Yazdi but also of Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah - Yazdi represents a serious blow to the senior clerics most alarmed by Rouhani and the prospect of better relations with the west .
But the views of less vocal Assembly members elected round the country may be less clear - cut than those trumpeted on the noisy hustings in Tehran .
Further surprises lie ahead .
Hassan Rouhani is a capable politician , if no reformist Iranâ€ ™ s president has proved himself an astute , hard - headed operator .
He not only carried the bulk of the political class behind the nuclear agreement , he has again won electoral endorsement for his pragmatic conservatism .
His politics are based on efforts to improve relations with other countries , including the United States ; reform of the economy to boost the private sector and attract foreign investment ; and some easing of press controls and morality policing .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s instincts and temperament do not favour exciting opinion leaders
â€ “ especially the urban middle - classes and students
â€ “ behind a programme of change .
He is well aware that the Khatami era and the street protests after the disputed 2009 election opened up bitter divisions within the political class : his approach is based rather on incremental change and building agreement .
Change comes dripping slowly ...
Economic reform to encourage sustainable growth
â€ “ increasing employment and improving living standards
â€ “ will challenge vested interests , including those that have benefited from the closed economy encouraged by sanctions and an ideology of â€˜resistanceâ€ ™ .
Rouhani will prefer reassurance to confrontation and will pick battles carefully .
Internationally , the region looks dangerous , and these are troubled times with unprecedented tensions between Sunnis and Shia .
This creates a tricky balance of keeping Iran â€˜strongâ€ ™ while also improving relations with both the US â€ “ even as a presidential election draws nearer â€ “ and an increasingly assertive Saudi Arabia .
Politically , Rouhani will need to maintain public support with an eye to being re - elected as president next year .
Anecdotal reports of a lower turn - out in poorer parts of Tehran may reflect most strongly a wider sense among Iranians they are not benefiting from the easing of sanctions .
In terms of the political class , Rouhani will need to reassure conservatives that cautious change continues to be in the interests of the Islamic Republic , while also offering reformists some concessions over political prisoners and censorship .

The article has been updated to reflect that upon final count Ahmad Jannati was not defeated in the Assembly race ."
2016-02-29,"Hassan Rouhaniâ€ ™ s friends and enemies alike identify him as the architect of Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear agreement that finally brought the end of sanctions last month .
After last Fridayâ€ ™ s elections the man who made the Barjam â€ “ the Persian acronym for the laboriously negotiated deal
â€ “ should be able to pursue further opening - up to the west , and perhaps implement gradual change at home .
The results of the twin elections for parliament and the clerical assembly of experts have been a significant boost for the president and vindicated the policy of engagement he has pursued since 2013 .
On the evidence of the results so far , in the next Majlis , the Iranian parliament , he will enjoy the support of a coalition of reformists , centrists or pragmatic conservatives more ready to confront suspicious hardliners .
In the run - up to the Vienna breakthrough last July , Rouhani came under severe pressure from â€œprinciplistsâ€ � opposed to dealing with the US and Europe .
Mohammad Javad Zarif , his foreign minister , was labelled a traitor and threatened with being buried in the concrete to be used to decommission the Arak nuclear reactor .
Despite the widespread disqualifications of candidates , reformists did not abandon the race .
Instead , they threw their weight behind a coalition with little - known independents and moderate conservatives that are on course to outnumber hardliners opposed to Rouhani .
Ali Larijani , the outgoing Majlis speaker , is a principlist from Qom but is on the presidentâ€ ™ s side â€ “ and serves as a useful conduit to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The same is true of Ali Motahari , a conservative on social issues â€ “ for example he supports compulsory hijab for women â€ “ but moderate on others .
â€œRouhani will face less opposition in the Majlis than before , â€ � said Sadegh Zibakalam , a professor of politics at Tehran University .
â€œHow much less we will have to wait and see.â€ �
Zibakalam hopes Rouhani may be able to secure the freedom of Mir - Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , presumed winners of the 2009 presidential election that was allegedly â€œstolenâ€ � by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The fact that they remain under house arrest vividly illustrates Rouhaniâ€ ™ s limitations .
Arvin , a cartoonist for the reformist Shargh paper , captured the sense of hope for change in Iran with the image of a ballot box sprouting wings and a dove holding an olive branch in its beak .
Analysts say Rouhani should find it easier to pursue economic liberalisation to attract investment to boost growth and create jobs for millions of Iranians , beyond a 25 % drop in inflation and the brokers rubbing their hands at the potential of the Tehran stock exchange .
Hardliners use nationalist rhetoric to attack Rouhaniâ€ ™ s post - sanctions business deals as serving a pampered elite and European not national interests , which they argue require a â€œresistance economyâ€ � .
Gholam - Ali Haddad - Adel , Khameneiâ€ ™ s confidant and head of the principlist election list , warned of foreigners seeking â€œto turn Iran into a bazaar of useless objectsâ€ � .
The Revolutionary Guards fear damage to their extensive financial interests : Mohammed Ali Vakili , a leading reformist , cautioned that in future they could not expect to be be exempt from taxes .
The next parliament , Zibakalam argues , should be less docile and ready to question Iranâ€ ™ s staunch support for Syriaâ€ ™ s Bashar al - Assad and the role played by the Revolutionary Guards , and to debate what it should be doing about fighting Islamic State , or the countryâ€ ™ s deteriorating relations with Saudi Arabia .
Others think that is a longer shot than hoping Rouhani will be ready to tackle the powerful judiciary or reduce regime monitoring of social behaviour .
The final outcome will be determined by runoff votes and alliances on specific issues .
Iranians understand , however , that there are strict limits to what Rouhani will be able to achieve even with a more friendly parliament â€ “ and to his own readiness to confront Khamenei , who welcomed the elections but also warned of the need to be aware of the dangers of â€œglobal arroganceâ€ � .
Power in the Islamic Republic remains firmly in the hands of the supreme leader even if Hashemi Rafsanjaniâ€ ™ s strong performance in the assembly of experts , despite vicious smear campaigns , has reminded hardliners that their grip can be weakened .
Recent harassment of dissidents and record numbers of executions reflect their anger and unease .
Reformists say they fear a backlash .
â€œParliament is only a secondary source of power , â€ � warns the economist Saeed Leylaz .
â€œWithout
Khameneiâ€
™ s agreement we will not be able to do anything and there will be no fundamental change.â€ � Baby steps towards reform in a region dominated by fears of Isis â€ “ and where democratic aspirations have so often been answered by violence â€ “ may still be the most that Iranians can expect ."
2016-02-29,"Final results for the Tehran constituency in Fridayâ€ ™ s twin Iranian elections show a sweeping victory for reformist - backed candidates in the race for parliament and the assembly of experts .
The candidates took all but one seat in the assembly â€ “ a powerful clerical body responsible for appointing the next supreme leader â€ “ and enjoyed a clean sweep of all 30 seats allocated to Tehran in the 290-seat Iranian parliament , the majlis .
Countrywide assembly results have not been announced yet , but reformist - backed candidates and independents allied with President Hassan Rouhani are expected to outnumber conservatives who are against his mandate .
Results from both elections amounted to a humiliating blow to hardliners in Iran , especially those who were intent in their opposition to Rouhaniâ€ ™ s moderate agenda , including reaching a landmark nuclear deal with the west .
Surprising gains by moderates and reformists in both elections are seen as a strong vote of confidence to Rouhani , which will significantly boost his chances of seeking re - election in 2017 .
A number of prominent hardline figures , who led the anti - Rouhani camp , have been blocked .
In Tehran , two ultra - conservative ayatollahs , Mohammad - Taghi Mesbah Yazdi and Mohammad Yazdi , the current chairman , lost their seats in the assembly .
Mesbah Yazdi is seen as the spiritual leader who played a crucial role in the rise to power of former hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The pragmatist Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a key Rouhani ally , topped the list of 16 winners in Tehran in the race for the assembly .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the current leader , and Rafsanjani , who was not allowed to run for president in 2013 , have been at odds in recent years .
Third on that list was Rouhani himself , who was running for a membership in the assembly while being the president .
The only winner who was not backed by the reformists was Ahmad Jannati , who won in the 16th place .
Jannati is the head of the Guardian Council , an unelected body in charge of vetting candidates before any election .
The assemblyâ€ ™ s results are in favour of the reformists not because reformist candidates are entering the clerical body but because of alliances with successful moderate - leaning candidates .
Hassan Khomeini â€ “ a grandson of the founder of the Islamic Republic , who was the reformistâ€ ™ s main candidate in the race for the assembly â€ “ was disqualified .
Many of the Tehran winners for the assembly are in fact conservatives but reformists were backing them in the hope of blocking hardliners .
On Sunday , Khamenei praised the high turnout , a sign that he approved of the results , and said it was a testament to the countryâ€ ™ s â€œreligious democracyâ€ � .
â€œI
thank
Iranâ€ ™ s wise and determined nation ...
and I hope the next parliament will act responsibly towards people and God , â€ � he said in a statement published in the local media .
In Tehranâ€ ™ s parliamentary race , a coalition of candidates supported by the reformists , dubbed â€œthe list of hopeâ€ � , took all of the capitalâ€ ™ s 30 parliamentary seats .
Mohammad Reza Aref , a committed reformist who has a degree from Stanford University in the US , is at the top of the list .
Gholam - Ali Haddad - Adel , a hardliner close to Khamenei , whose name topped the list of â€œprincipalistâ€ � candidates , lose his seat in the parliament .
The results in the provinces are still unclear , but in the race for the parliament a combination of moderates and independents sympathetic to Rouhani are leading .
Results may not be finalised until Tuesday , but if they tally with the initial figures there will be a palpable change in the Iranian political landscape , with moderates dominating the scene and hardliners being pushed to the fringes .
Strong gains by supporters of Rouhani could help promote greater opening to the west by Iran and limit political advances by conservatives at home â€ “ and secure him a second term in office next year .
Up to 20 women are expected to win parliamentary seats , a record for Iran .
Among them is the reformist candidate Parvaneh Salahshori , who said in a recent foreign media interview that women should have a choice to wear the hijab .
The issue is a taboo subject in the Islamic Republic ."
2016-03-01,"On 26 February , Iranians voted to elect the new members of their legislative body and the assembly of experts .
While the parliamentâ€ ™ s resultant shift to the centre does not give the president , Hassan Rouhani , a free hand , it will help him in his efforts to engage Iranâ€ ™ s Gulf Arab neighbours .
Presidential elections are generally what draw the broader public to the polls in Iran , while parliamentary elections galvanise the Islamic Republicâ€ ™ s base .
Candidates and camps fight for the soul of the Islamic revolution and the countryâ€ ™ s future .
This year , the struggle was more visible than usual .
More than half of eligible voters showed up to the polls , and helped key reformist - backed candidates and moderates gain seats in parliament .
Let us put this in context .
In July 2015 , Rouhani agreed to a nuclear deal , which limited Tehranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief .
Much of the population was in favour of the deal , but a small yet vocal minority remained opposed .
Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , quietened that opposition and encouraged the dealâ€ ™ s implementation .
Iranâ€ ™ s hardliners had lost the battle but the war continued .
They attacked many of the presidentâ€ ™ s stated priorities and his methods , including the attempts to tackle regional instability and insecurity .
In particular , Rouhaniâ€ ™ s efforts to engage with Saudi Arabia faced staunch opposition from hardliners .
One of the first goals of his new administration was to open a dialogue with Iranâ€ ™ s neighbours , but members of parliament relentlessly attacked the foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , for reaching out to Riyadh .
It was only thanks to the support of Khamenei and Larijani over the nuclear deal that Zarif and Rouhani had enough political capital to continue to pursue their agenda .
And these election results were a further slap in the face for Iranâ€ ™ s hardliners .
Increasingly divided , with some moderate conservatives splintering to form their own bloc , they still maintain considerable influence and are likely to increase their efforts to oppose Rouhani in the face of this latest defeat .
They can both complicate his political and foreign agenda , and set a much more rigid tone .
In order to prevent this , Khamenei or Larijani would have to step in and call for moderation .
But the supreme leader does not have the same moderating influence on regional issues that he did in the nuclear negotiations .
Security policy remains under the purview of Iranâ€ ™ s Revolutionary Guards .
As a result , Iranâ€ ™ s dealings with Syria and Iraq will continue on their current course .
It is difficult for the foreign ministry to influence Iranâ€ ™ s activities on the ground , regardless of the moderate victory in parliament .
Any changes will be the result of external factors , such as an increase in the number of deaths occurring in the field , or an untenable squeeze on the Revolutionary Guardsâ€ ™ resources .
But the elections are likely to change Iranâ€ ™ s outreach efforts towards its Gulf neighbours .
Following the stampede at the Hajj that killed hundreds of Iranian citizens , the Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al - Nimrâ€ ™ s killing , and Saudi Arabiaâ€ ™ s continuing military campaign in Yemen ,
Iranâ€ ™ s
conservatives find the noises coming out of Riyadh increasingly difficult to ignore .
Multiple anti - Saudi rallies were organised with slogans reminiscent of the rhetoric normally reserved for the United States or Israel .
Conservative parliamentarians have consistently questioned the foreign ministerâ€ ™ s resolve to talk to Iranâ€ ™ s â€œhostileâ€ � neighbours .
They made it clear that they believe that engagement with Saudi Arabia is not in Iranâ€ ™ s best interest .
Last Fridayâ€ ™ s vote of confidence in the Rouhani administration , combined with parliamentâ€ ™ s shift to the centre , will allow the government to pursue its policy of engagement with its Gulf Arab neighbours .
While the moderates may differ on how far this should go , all agree that the status quo is not sustainable .
As a result , Zarif will likely double his efforts to travel to more friendly Gulf capitals , such as Doha , and continue to insist on dialogue with Saudi Arabia in order to tackle regional security crises .
Post - election politicking in Iran is notoriously difficult to predict .
What will follow this time is no exception .
But the reformist and moderate victory will remove barriers to dialogue on the Iranian side .
It remains to be seen whether the other side of the Persian Gulf is ready to respond ."
2016-03-04,"Boosted by the victory of his moderate allies in recent elections in Iran , the all - smiles President Hassan Rouhani is now in a stronger position to pursue the much - neglected human rights challenges facing his country .
Although rights violations in Iran are largely carried out by a judiciary and parallel intelligence apparatus that act independently of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government , the president , as the most senior elected official in the Islamic republic , is responsible under the constitution to protect his citizens .
In the first two years of his presidency , Rouhaniâ€ ™ s focus was on resolving the nuclear impasse , which appeared to be as much a priority for his administration as it was for the electorate .
With the nuclear dossier now almost closed and his main campaign promise delivered , Rouhani is being urged to shift his attention towards human rights , which critics say he has put on the backburner .
His promise of establishing a citizensâ€ ™ rights charter is yet to materialise .
Nasrin Sotoudeh , a human rights lawyer living in Iran , said on Wednesday that she was pleased with the election results , even though a significant number of candidates had been disqualified from standing .
Sotoudeh said human rights violations remain a big concern for Iranian society but added it was important people managed their expectations , to avoid disappointment .
â€œWe do not expect the president to play the role of the opposition , â€ �
she said , adding that she did not want Rouhani to push beyond his capacity but to manage institutions not yet under his influence , such as the intelligence ministry .
â€œWe believe Iranians themselves would also need to make an effort to improve their rights situation but the president can also pursue policies that will have positive consequences on human rights.â€ � How much Rouhani delivers on greater domestic freedom in his remaining two years as president is likely to affect his chances of seeking re - election next year .
Alarming rate of executions , including juveniles
Former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was once single - handedly the most significant factor in damaging Iranâ€ ™ s global image with his inflammatory statements denying the Holocaust .
But that has now given way to the alarmingly high level of capital punishment .
News of positive developments in Iran is punctuated every so often by the execution of a new group of people .
Mohammad - Javad Larijani , the head of Iranâ€ ™ s state - run high council for human rights , has indicated that there are efforts to take a new law to parliament that will result in â€œalmost 80 % of the executionsâ€ � going away but it is unclear if that effort is serious .
Most people executed are sentenced to death for drug offences , with trials widely condemned as unfair .
Sotoudeh said too many cases have only one judge presiding from the beginning to the end when a death sentence is issued without judgments being challenged or thoroughly examined .
It emerged last month that the entire adult male population of a village in southern Iran had been executed for drug offences , said the vice - president for women and family affairs .
According to Amnesty International , Iran remains a prolific executioner , second only to China .
In 2014 , at least 753 people were hanged , of whom more than half were drug offenders .
In 2015 , the group said it had recorded â€œa staggering execution rateâ€ � in the country , â€œwith nearly 700 people put to death in the first half of the year aloneâ€ � .
It said in a report published in January that 73 juvenile offenders had been executed between 2005 and 2015 .
One , Amir Amrollahi , is currently on death row even though he committed the crime when he was 16 .
Not everyone on death row in Iran is a drug smuggler .
Mohammad Ali Taheri , who has been held in solitary confinement since May 2011 , is facing death for â€œspreading corruption on earthâ€ � through establishing a spiritual group called Erfan - e Halgheh and promoting beliefs and practices that authorities deem un - Islamic .
Opposition leaders under house arrest for five years
Iranâ€ ™ s
three main opposition leaders , Mir Hossein Mousavi , his wife Zahra Rahnavard , and Mehdi Karroubi , have been confined within their houses since their movements were restricted in February 2011 without trial .
Mousavi and Rahnavard are in their house in a dead - end alley in Tehran called Akhtar , under constant heavy guard by the police .
Karroubi is under similar circumstances in another part of the capital .
They have largely been kept incommunicado although have recently been allowed regular visits by some immediate family members .
There are serious concerns about their health , with an image emerging online of Mousavi in May 2014 showing him in a Tehran hospital bed due to a heart condition .
Former president Mohammad Khatami , the leader of the reformist movement , is not under house arrest but is facing restrictions on his movement and activities .
Iranian media is banned from publishing his name or photograph .
Prisoners of conscience languishing in jail
The exact number of prisoners held in Iranian jails on political grounds or because of their beliefs and civil activities is unclear .
A number of them , including blogger Hossein Ronaghi Maleki , have serious health issues and need medical care .
Amnesty said he â€œhas only one functioning kidney and , according to his doctors , needs constant monitoring and access to specialised medical care , which he can not get in prisonâ€ � .
He was taken back to Tehranâ€ ™ s notorious Evin prison in January to resume his 13-year sentence , which he received after the authorities deemed his blog insulting to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
There are at least 18 female prisoners of conscience , including Narges Mohammadi , a journalist and and spokesperson for the Centre for Human Rights Defenders .
Mohammadi , a mother of two and winner of the 2009 Alexander Langer award for her human rights activities , has developed an undiagnosed epilepsy - like disease while in prison which causes her to temporarily lose control over her muscles .
Other prisoners include student activist Bahareh Hedayat , artist Atena Farghadani â€ “ sentenced to 12 years â€ “ and anti - death penalty activist Atena Daemi â€ “ sentenced to 14 years .
Minoo Mortazi Langeroudi , a womenâ€ ™ s rights activist and member of the Council of Melli Mazhabi Activists , was sentenced to six years in June 2015 .
Other people are persecuted outside prison , with Amnesty saying earlier this week that filmmaker Hossein Rajabian , his brother Mehdi Rajabian and Yousef Emadi , both musicians , risk imminent arrest after an appeal court upheld their prison sentences on charges relating to their work .
â€œThese sentences lay bare the absurdity of Iranâ€ ™ s criminal justice system , which brands individuals as criminals merely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression through making music and films .
These young men should never have been arrested , let alone brought to trial , â€ � said Said Boumedouha , Amnesty Internationalâ€ ™ s Middle East and North Africa deputy director .
Civil society is still active although many freedoms are suppressed and basic rights denied .
For example , women are obliged to wear hijab and are not allowed to watch matches in stadiums alongside men .
In March 2015 , Qasem Exirifard , a physics professor , lost his job because he was told he had a feminine voice that prevented him from effectively communicating with his students .
Exirifard said on Thursday that he was beginning a hunger strike after failing to overturn the universityâ€ ™ s decision .
Judiciary heavily influenced by intelligence apparatus
One of the biggest challenges is the judiciary .
The head of the judicial system is appointed by the supreme leader and no elected officials , such as the president , can hold him to account .
The crackdown on journalists and political activists is spearheaded by a small group of judges believed to be heavily influenced by the intelligence apparatus at the Revolutionary Guards .
Two judges , Abolghassem Salavati and Mohammad Moghiseh , are accused of repeatedly losing their judicial impartiality and overseeing miscarriages of justice in trials in which journalists , lawyers , political activists and members of ethnic and religious minorities have been condemned to lengthy prison terms , lashes and execution .
Common violations include holding trials behind closed doors which last only a few minutes and lack essential legal procedures , intimidating defendants , breaching judicial independence by acting as prosecutors themselves and depriving prisoners of access to lawyers .
Businessman Siamak Namazi , an Iranian - American national , who was jailed with no explanation in October after visiting his family , has no access to lawyers .
His 80-year - old father , Baquer Namazi , a former Unicef official , has also been arrested and denied access to lawyers , say the family .
Treatment of BahÃ¡â€ ™ Ã­s and other religious and ethnic minorities
The BahÃ¡â€ ™
Ã­s are the most persecuted religious minority in the country , with the faithâ€ ™ s seven leaders â€ “ Fariba Kamalabadi , Vahid Tizfahm , Jamaloddin Khanjani , Afif Naeimi , Mahvash Sabet , Behrouz Tavakkoli and Saeid Rezaie â€ “ each serving a 20-year jail term .
Christians , Jews and Zoroastrians are recognised as accepted religious minorities .
They have parliamentary representatives and the captain of the national football team is a Christian but the BahÃ¡â€ ™ Ã­ faith is banned and more than 100 BahÃ¡â€ ™
Ã­s are estimated to be in prison .
Many BahÃ¡â€ ™
Ã­s have been expelled from universities and others jailed for providing education to other BahÃ¡â€ ™ Ã­. Muslims whose denominations are not accepted , such as the Gonabadi dervishes also face persecution , with members often imprisoned .
Gonabadi dervishes face persecution , discrimination , harassment , arbitrary arrests and attacks on their prayer houses , Amnesty said .
Rouhani has made some improvements after promising in his election campaign in 2013 to protect and promote the rights of groups such as Arabs , Azeris , Kurds , Baluchis , Turkmens and Armenians .
He appointed Ali Younesi , a former intelligence minister , to serve as his special assistant in minoritiesâ€ ™ affairs , marking the first time such a position was created .
But minorities still face widespread discrimination and inequalities in areas such as access to education , welfare and having their mother tongue taught at school .
The treatment of Afghan refugees Nearly 1 million Afghan people are registered as refugees but there are thought to be at least 2 million more who are living illegally .
The majority face difficulties in continuing education , having bank accounts , receiving paperwork to leave the country or accessing work .
Recognised Afghan refugees will never be able to obtain Iranian nationality regardless of how long they have spent in the country .
Discrimination is rife , with many using the derogatory term â€œAfghaniâ€ � ( Afghanâ€ ™ s national currency ) , but civil rights activists have taken steps to raise awareness .
It emerged last year that authorities were recruiting Afghan refugees on a daily basis to fight in Syria , promising them a monthly salary and residence permit in exchange for what it claims to be a sacred endeavour to save the holy Shia shrines in Damascus .
Intimidation of journalists and lawyers The New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists said , in a December 2015 report , that more journalists are in jail in Iran than any country other than China and Egypt .
Jason Rezaian , the Washington Post reporter held for over a year , was released as part of a prisoner swap with the US in January .
A number of journalists , bloggers and cartoonists are in prison and many have faced long sentences , such as Ahmad Zeidabadi , who was recently made the International Press Instituteâ€ ™ s 68th World Press Freedom Hero .
The constitution says censorship is prohibited but the country has one of
the worldâ€ ™ s worst records for press freedom and dozens of newspapers have closed in the past decade .
Many journalists , such as those working for the BBCâ€ ™ s Persian service , can not return to Iran for fear of arrest .
Journalists also face harassment including bars from leaving the country , passport confiscation and being summoned for interrogation .
Reporters Without Borders said : â€œWith a total of 37 journalists and citizen - journalists currently detained , Iran is still one of the worldâ€ ™ s five biggest prisons for media personnel and is ranked 173rd out of 180 countries in the 2015 Reporters Without Borders press freedom index.â€ �
It added that Afarine Chitsaz of the daily Iran , Ehssan Mandarinier , the editor of the daily Farhikhteghan , Saman Safarzai of the monthly Andisher Poya and Issa Saharkhiz , an independent journalist , were arrested in November .
Roya Saberi Negad Nobakht , a citizen - journalist with dual Iranian and British citizenship , is serving a five - year sentence and has repeatedly fainted while in prison .
Many lawyers are also in prison , including Abdolfattah Soltani , who is serving a 13-year sentence , and Mohammad Seifzadeh , facing six years .
Ahmed Shaheed , the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran , warned in his latest report that parliament was introducing a bill which â€œenvisions significant government influence over the activities of the Iranian Bar Associationâ€ � that would â€œbring the relatively independent association under greater supervision of government officialsâ€ � ."
2016-04-19,"The relationship between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iranâ€ ™ s leader , and president Hassan Rouhani has been at the heart of the domestic political realignment that made possible last Julyâ€ ™ s nuclear agreement with world powers and the strong showing for pro - agreement candidates in Februaryâ€ ™ s elections for parliament and Majles - e Khobregan ( the Experts Assembly ) , the clerical body that chooses the leader .
Next up comes improving economic performance , and this will be another challenge for both men and for their relationship .
Both would like to see higher economic growth â€ “ at least the 5 % that could see the labour market absorb new entrants each year â€ “ and both know faster and wider easing of international sanctions would help .
In his Nowruz speech in Mashhad on 20 March Khamenei accused the US of failing to respect the terms of last Julyâ€ ™ s nuclear pact by not lifting financial sanctions .
The leader suggested Iran needed to maintain a â€œresistance economyâ€ � to â€œfight unemployment and recession , control inflation and confront the threats of enemiesâ€ � .
At tone at least , this differed from Rouhaniâ€ ™ s continuing emphasis on attracting foreign investment and encouraging overseas trade , and from his desire to boost the role of the private sector â€ “ foreign and domestic - and therefore to constrain state and quasi - state organisations like tax - exempt religious foundations and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) .
Just as over the nuclear agreement , Khamenei must placate a variety of constituents .
Would - be foreign investors need reassurances â€ “ no wonder , given the billions involved in many cases
â€ “ but Khamenei needs also to carry fundamentalist supporters wary of foreign influence and fearful of any weakening of the Islamic Republicâ€ ™ s commitment to egalitarianism .
And , of course , vested interests need appeasing .
Suitably , the term â€˜resistance economyâ€ ™ is flexible .
Since Khamenei first used it in 2010 , it has generally carried two related if different meanings - a push for self - sufficiency and domestic production , and secondly a commitment to the central place in the economy of â€˜committedâ€ ™ bodies like the IRGC .
While the case for a â€˜resistance economyâ€ ™ in either sense was enhanced by sanctions , the term can stretch far enough to cover either a near - siege wartime economy with low international trade or an economy with a vibrant private sector that can compete well internationally .
Two years ago , Khamenei issued a degree calling for a â€˜resistance economyâ€ ™ based on higher production and self - sufficiency , greater investment of revenue from oil sales , financial reform , greater transparency and â€˜knowledge - basedâ€ ™ industries .
The decree was drafted by the Expediency Council , chaired by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , Rouhani ally and fellow schemer in Februaryâ€ ™ s elections .
Since Rafsanjani as president first encouraged the IRGC into an expanded economic role after the 1980 - 88 Iraq war , he has had second thoughts : it seems his notion now , presumably shared with Rouhani , is to shape the â€˜resistance economyâ€ ™ in such a way as to convince , or undermine , opponents who want to defend the IRGCâ€ ™ s protected economic position or resist Rouhaniâ€ ™ s desire for detente with the US .
Will it work ?
The roots of a siege mentality are strong , going back to the 1979 Revolution and the heroism of the 1980 - 88 war with Iraq , when there was talk of â€œeconomic jihadâ€ � .
Years of economic sanctions have hardly encouraged openness , and have enhanced the IRGCâ€ ™ s role , both in import - export and in energy and infrastructure projects as its affiliated companies took over when international operators dropped out .
Security considerations invariably favour those with the right connections and play against any kind of open competition .
The challenge for Iranâ€ ™ s leadership â€ “ Khamenei and Rouhani â€ “ is increased by the fact most Iranians have not benefited from the easing of sanctions since the nuclear deal .
As has been highlighted by the invariably astute Djavad Salehi - Isfahani , economics professor at Virginia Tech , the Statistical Centre of Iran reported last month that both inequality and poverty had increased in the Iranian year ending on March 20 , so ending a four - year decline in both .
Poorer Iranians are an important base for the egalitarianism that has long fuelled the fundamentalist camp , including the Basij movement , while improving economic conditions has always been at the motivational heart of more pragmatic conservatives like Rouhani and Rafsanjani .
It was surprising , then , that Khamenei in his Nowruz speech welcomed the â€œpreliminary actionsâ€ � of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government in reducing inflation to 13 % from over 40 % but also set a timescale for â€œappropriate actionsâ€ � to produce improvements by â€œthe end of the yearâ€ � ( that is , the end of the Iranian year in March 2017 ) .
Rouhani is well aware that the next presidential election is due shortly after that , in June , and that he will need a clearer â€˜feel goodâ€ ™ factor if , as widely assumed , he seeks re - election .
With his critics still on the back foot after Februaryâ€ ™ s elections , Rouhani must feel a reasonable confidence .
This will be helped by the lack of an obvious , charismatic challenger .
Saeid Golkar , senior fellow at Chicago Council on Global Affairs and lecturer at Northwestern University , who closely monitors chatter on social media told Tehran Bureau recently there are many who think Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should run again : â€œHe remains popular with the lower class , including the Basij , these people .
Ahmadinejad knows this and believes they will come back to him for the next election ... without Ahmadinejad , the hardliners donâ€ ™ t have anyone to compete , someone with charisma who can mobilise peopleâ€ � .
In 2005 Ahmadinejad promised to put the â€˜oil money on the sofreh [ the mat poorer Iranians sit on to eat their dinner]â€ ™ .
With oil revenue so far down , a new slogan would be needed , but economic expectations , or hopes , remain crucial to any electoral battle .
In his own message for Nowruz , Rouhani said he aimed for 5 % growth over the next year and announced himself â€œcertain that with interaction with the world , we can move towards economic prosperityâ€ � .
With unemployment at 11 % officially , job creation is vital and what Rouhani can achieve â€ “ and how he can achieve it - is complicated by the US dragging its feet over financial sanctions .
Interestingly , recent discussions in Tehran between Bijan Namdar Zangeneh , Iranâ€ ™ s oil minister , and his Indian counterpart Dharmendra Pradhan focused not just on increasing Iranâ€ ™ s oil exports and Indian investment of up to $ 20bn in energy schemes in eastern Iran but over payment methods .
Tehranâ€ ™ s continuing problems in accessing around $ 6.5bn in oil receipts from India reflects Washingtonâ€ ™ s continuing restrictions on Iraniansâ€ ™ access to the dollar .
International sanctions against Iran are a complex web â€ “ and not one that could be readily swept away with the speed or vigour Iranâ€ ™ s leaders hoped .
Washington continues to designate some Iranian entities , including the IRGC , as terrorist , which worries potential investors in Iran as they struggle to understand exactly what the IRGC â€˜ownsâ€ ™ .
So , as with the nuclear agreement , the â€œresistance economyâ€ � will depend not just on what happens in Iran , but on what happens in the US .
The US Treasury has expanded its reach through enforcing stringent financial sanctions : it can spread fear merely by flexing its muscles .
Or , as Khamenei put it at Nowruz , by acting â€œin such a way that big corporations , big institutions and big banks do not dare come and deal with Iranâ€ � .
Barack Obama has delivered on his 2008 campaign promise to engage with Iran , reaching a nuclear agreement many sceptics said would never happen .
But his term is nearing its end , and Donald Trump is only the most extreme option facing Tehran .
Candidates have been competing , noted Khamenei , â€œto vilifyâ€
� Iran .
Take that as call for the troops of the â€œresistance economyâ€
�
â€ “ whether in uniforms or civvies
â€ “ not to leave the trenches any time soon .

2016-04-27,"Three journalists in Iran have been given lengthy prison sentences as the countryâ€ ™ s hardline judiciary tightens its grip on press freedom in a move seen as undercutting the moderate president , Hassan Rouhani .
A revolutionary court in Tehran found the three Iranians guilty of charges including spreading propaganda against the ruling system , conspiring against officials and insulting authorities â€ “ charges often used against those held on political grounds .
The three are Afarin Chitsaz , of the governmentâ€ ™ s official newspaper , Iran , who was sentenced to 10 years in prison ; Ehsan Mazandarani , editor - in - chief of the daily Farhikhtegan , sentenced to seven years ; and Saman Safarzaee , of the monthly Andisheh Pouya , who was given five years .
Lawyers said they would appeal .
Local media quoted lawyers as saying that a fourth person , Davoud Asadi , whom they said was also a member of the press , had been sentenced to five years .
But his brother , Houshang Asadi , of the opposition news website Roozonline , told the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) that Davoud was not a journalist .
All three of the jailed journalists work for outlets sympathetic to Rouhaniâ€ ™ s administration .
They were arrested in November along with another prominent Iranian journalist , Issa Saharkhiz , who previously served as a press official in the government of the former president Mohammad Khatami .
Saharkhizâ€ ™ s fate is unclear but in March he was taken to a hospital in Tehran after suffering a heart attack .
In January he had gone on hunger strike to protest against his prolonged detention .
Their arrests took place after Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , repeatedly warned against enemy plots to infiltrate the country .
Hardline media subsequently linked the journalists to an â€œinfiltrating networkâ€ � spearheaded by Britain and the US .
An elite Revolutionary Guards affiliate told state television last year that a network of opposition activists were using journalists in Iran for their own purposes , the refomist Shargh newspaper reported .
Rouhani has warned officials against misusing â€œinfiltrationâ€ � as grounds to curb social freedoms , but his hands are tied as such arrests are carried out by an intelligence apparatus and a judiciary that act independently of his government .
Critics say Rouhani could do more , not least by speaking out .
The president has largely remained silent on the issue of political prisoners .
The trial of the three journalists took place at an Islamic revolutionary court .
Such courts were set up after the 1979 Iranian revolution to deal with cases of national security , and still exist despite disputes over their constitutional footing .
On Tuesday it emerged that Hadi Heidari , a cartoonist , had been released after serving a prison sentence .
Separately , a 12-year sentence imposed on Atena Farghadani , an artist and womenâ€ ™ s rights activist , for depicting MPs with faces of animals has been commuted to 18 months , and her lawyer said she would be eligible for release next month .
Iran is one of the worldâ€ ™ s worst jailers of journalists , according to the New York - based CPJ .
The group also lists the Islamic Republic among the worldâ€ ™ s 10 most censored countries , along with Saudi Arabia , China and Cuba .
Iranâ€ ™ s constitution unambiguously bans censorship .
The CPJ and Reporters Without Borders strongly condemned the sentencing of the three journalists .
â€œConvicting journalists for â€˜acting against national securityâ€ ™ underlines the need to change the over - broad laws that lead to the harassment and jailing of the media , â€ � said the CPJâ€ ™ s Sherif Mansour .
â€œIranian authorities must cease imprisoning journalists.â€ �
At least 19 professional journalists are currently behind bars in Iran , according to the CPJâ€ ™ s 2015 census .
Iran is ranked 169 out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Bordersâ€ ™ s 2016 world press freedom index , scoring better than North Korea and Syria but worse than Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
According to the Journalism is Not a Crime project , which aims to document the persecution of journalists in Iran , at least 58 journalists , bloggers and cartoonists are currently in prison , nine are awaiting trial and 41 are in exile ."
2016-04-27,"Your Excellency , the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Dr Hassan Rouhani :
We the undersigned , a group of university professors in North America , write you concerning the dire circumstances of a number of political prisoners in Iran .
It is our hope that you would consider intervening on their behalf and arranging for their immediate hospitalization under the care of competent and expert physicians .
Much distressing news is emerging concerning the battle some of these political prisoners are waging against cancer .
It is common knowledge that in such cases the patient must be diagnosed in a timely manner and put under the care of competent physicians .
According to reliable sources , political prisoners are routinely denied access to immediate medical care .
Prison authorities seem to habitually delay or limit access of inmates to the prison hospital .
Medical care providers who have attended to these seriously ill prisoners have lacked proper medical qualifications .
They may even have violated their medical oaths .
We call upon you to order an immediate investigation of the medical files of the political prisoners named in this letter to ascertain the veracity of our charges .
Many of these political prisoners who are battling cancer are not allowed to visit outside hospitals specializing in oncology .
The conditions of prisons add to the stress that can not help but worsen their ailments .
Prisoners who are serving their sentences often come under pressure to collaborate with the security forces as spies or to appear on national television and confess to crimes they have not committed .
Meanwhile , the entire prison is flooded in harmful and potentially carcinogenic telecommunication waves aimed at jamming mobile phones .
Prisoners often complain of headaches that may be related to this reckless policy .
Drinking water in Evin prison is not safe for consumption .
Prisonersâ€ ™ daily diet is poor and ill - suited to their conditions .
Prisoners are often subjected to psychological pressures which border on â€œwhite tortureâ€ � .
The families of these political prisoners are also under constant pressure .
Contrary to the rules and regulations of Iranian prisons , political inmates are denied brief furloughs allowed to non - political prisoners .
The number of political prisoners that during the last few months have protested their conditions by engaging in hunger strike has increased .
Some have gone so far as sewing their lips in protest .
Unfortunately the judicial authorities in the Islamic Republic have no respect for the rudimentary principles of human rights , the Constitution of the Islamic Republic , or even their own rules and regulations governing prisons .
The relationship between the totality of these conditions and the epidemic of cancer and other chronic diseases sweeping Iranâ€ ™ s prisons must be carefully studied .
The affliction of the young physicist Omid Kowkabi with cancer of the kidney and the reckless procrastinating policy of prison authorities in failing to provide him with proper care ( leading to the removal of his kidney in a recent operation ) is a glaring example of the condition we have outlined above .
We also bring to your attention another political prisoner , Hossein Ronaghi , who is suffering from severe kidney failure and who has started a hunger strike to protest his unbearable conditions .
The third example is Isa Saharkhiz who after a prolonged hunger strike is now diagnosed with the cancer of the adrenal glands â€ “ a condition that should have been diagnosed and treated much earlier .
The fourth case is Dr Alireza Rajaâ€ ™ i , who after enduring five years of imprisonment is now battling the cancer of the jaw and face .
Physicians are dismayed that he was not reported for treatment in a timely fashion .
The fifth case is Dr Hossein Rafiee , retired professor of Chemistry at Tehran University , suffering from multiple ailments .
These are just a few , long suffering political prisoners who are still alive .
Mohsen Dokmehchi lost his life to cancer while incarcerated .
Ahmad Qabel was diagnosed with brain cancer while in prison .
He died soon after he was sent to the hospital in the final stages of his affliction .
Contrary to the official promise by the state that old and sick prisoners would be freed to receive treatment , no such accommodations have been made for political prisoners .
Mr President , although you are not in charge of the Judiciary , you remain the highest ranking elected official in Iran .
As such , you are duty - bound to protect the basic rights of Iranian people and those imprisoned on political charges .
We are witness to your admirable work on the global stage for a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issues based on mutual respect .
You have done much to achieve a more respectable image for Iran .
We are confident that addressing the dire condition of political prisoners in Iran and their urgent medical needs will enhance the humanitarian image of Iran around the globe .
If the urgent release of these political prisoners is not possible , please allow for a group of independent specialist physicians from within Iran or international organizations such as Doctors without Borders , International Red Crescent / Red Cross and the United Nations ) to visit these prisoners and those who have been recently released but who suffer from a variety of ailments .
The physicians should be allowed to examine their medical files and assist the medical experts engaged in treatment of these individuals .

2016-05-06,"Hassan Rouhani has taken almost three years to find his voice but at last , and coincidentally one year before his first term as Iranian president runs out , the moderate cleric has become increasingly vocal and blunt .
It is a gradual , yet noticeable departure from his hitherto reserved and often indirect modus operandi .
The theologian turned lawyer then president has been bolstered domestically by recent parliamentary elections , which dealt hardliners a humiliating blow , and by his success in peacefully resolving the dispute over Tehranâ€ ™ s nuclear dossier , the main promise on which he ran his campaign in 2013 .
A careful examination of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s speeches in recent months shows a president who appears to have become more confident about speaking his mind .
He has not been shy in drawing the line on a number of contentious domestic issues , even when his views have put him at odds with the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
â€œWhy
has the presidentâ€ ™
s
tone changed?â€
� asked the reformist - leaning newspaper Aftab - e - Yazd on its front page on Wednesday .
The president , the Iranian daily said , had â€œbecome more determined and firmer â€ ¦ he talks about issues that he refused to address in the pastâ€ � .
Parliamentary results are the clue , it added .
Reformist - leaning candidates and independents allied with Rouhani will hold a majority , albeit not an absolute one , in the next parliament .
And , for the first time since the 1979 revolution , there will be more women than clerics in the parliament .
Saeed Barzin , a London - based Iranian analyst , described Rouhani as a soloist in a big orchestra .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re hearing the music and unexpectedly he plays his instrument , drawing all the attention , â€ � Barzin said .
â€œRouhani is a moderate , pragmatist politician but every so often he says something all of a sudden and recently he does this more often and does that with greater confidence and courage.â€
�
Recent examples of this include a speech at Tehranâ€ ™ s international book fair .
â€œA criticâ€ ™ s place is not in prison , â€ � the president told publishers and members of the Iranian intelligentsia , acknowledging the plight of many writers and journalists held in Iranian prisons .
â€œWe need to provide security and freedom to our writers .
It is a blessing to have a critic , â€ � he added .
In a separate speech , he made clear he opposed attempts to bar a female MP from the next parliament apparently because of allegations she did not observe the compulsory hijab rule during a trip abroad .
The Guardian Council , an unelected powerful body in charge of vetting candidates , has so far refused to issue her credentials even though she has won a seat .
In a separate speech , Rouhani reacted strongly to news about the policeâ€ ™ s deployment of undercover agents tasked with cracking down on womenâ€ ™ s not wearing the hajib , saying : â€œWe have no right to interfere in our peopleâ€ ™ s public and private lives outside what has been outlined in the law , â€ � he said .
â€œSome wake up in the morning and come up with new regulations , â€ � he continued , before saying they had no right to do so .
While Barzin points to the nuclear deal with the west and the parliamentary vote as the reasons why Rouhani increasingly speaks out , the analyst also believes that
Iranâ€ ™ s political system appears to show more leeway in tolerating opposing views within itself .
â€œWe have entered a new phase in which different political factions in Iran have recognised there is multipolarity among those within the system , â€ � Barzin said .
â€œIt
doesnâ€ ™ t appear to be a politics of elimination and
I donâ€ ™ t think either Rouhani or Khamenei are seeking to stand against each other or eliminate one another.â€ � Ahmad Salamatian , a former Iranian MP now based in Paris , said Rouhani was becoming more vocal in response to the supreme leader interjecting on often trivial domestic matters .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re merely hearing the president more lately and thatâ€ ™ s because Khamenei has become more persistent in expressing his views , views which often are in contrast with those held by the government.â€ �
Both men have had a go at each other in recent months , although without directly saying who they are referring to .
In his Persian new yearâ€ ™ s address
Rouhani spoke of the second Barjam ( deal ) , a reference to building on the international nuclear accord and to also finding an agreement internally .
Khamenei condemned such approach within hours in his own public address .
Recently Khamenei said insisting on the promotion of English language was wrong .
Rouhani , who was a postgrad student at Glasgow Caledonian University in the 1990s , responded by saying it was up to people which language they preferred to study .
Some fear that he risks running foul of Khamenei .
A former MP , Ali Tajernia , told Iranâ€ ™ s Arman daily this week that some influential figures had warned the president not to run for a second term .
Salamatian , however , said Rouhani knew his limits and was not seeking to confront Khamenei
: â€œI believe compared to previous presidents including the reformist Mohammad Khatami , Rouhani has been more successful in defending whatever is allowed within powers given to a president under this system.â€ �
The white - turban - wearing Rouhani is described as an ultimate insider , having held several sensitive jobs in the Islamic Republic .
Ali Alizadeh , a London - based political analyst , echoed Salamatianâ€ ™ s view that it was Khamenei who had become more blunt .
However , he was not sure whether Rouhani could shield himself in the long term from the supreme leader .
â€œKhamenei is trying to both find a legacy for his leadership and also organise fundamentalists , thus appearing in the role of a political party leader .
These have made Khamenei and Rouhani to draw their lines in a way that is more noticeable , â€ � said Alizadeh .
Experts inside Iran remain reluctant to discuss the issue .
But Gholamhossein Karbaschi , a former mayor of Tehran and a senior politician close to Rouhaniâ€ ™ s camp , said he did not detect any change in the presidentâ€ ™ s language .
â€œHe is not saying anything that is radical , against the norm or anti - moderation , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œThe sort of things he is saying now , he has been saying for three years n various occasions.â€ �
Although Rouhami remains popular , the prospect of him securing a second term in next yearâ€ ™ s presidential elections remains far from certain .
The nuclear deal has soothed threats of war and created some internal stability but it has not yet borne fruit on the economic side .
Western businesses eager to return to doing business in Iran have found it more difficult than initially thought , especially because of a reluctance on the part of European banks to handle Iranian payments owing to existing US sanctions relating to terrorism .
Iran has repeatedly called on the US to do more to reassure banks about dealing with Iran post - nuclear sanctions .
Some experts fear that US intransigence on the matter may as well cost Rouhani his second term if people in Iran run out of patience while waiting to see the economic benefits of the nuclear agreement .
There has been criticism of Rouhani putting the issue of social freedoms on the back burner while devoting almost two years of his presidency to the nuclear negotiation , a priority of both his administration and the people who elected him .
The president has finally raised his voice , but the limits of his power and how much he can do in a system with parallel unelected bodies remain clear ."
2016-05-09,"A grand vision of eliminating water scarcity looks attractive for tens of millions of people in the desert cities of central Iran worried about drought .
Ambitious water transfer projects are being put in place to answer a call from President Hassan Rouhani .
Two high - profile projects would see desalinised water transferred to the central plateau from the Caspian Sea , and from the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman .
Mohammadreza Khabbaz , governor of Semnan , a province sandwiched between the lush Caspian Sea coastline and the central salt desert , is a staunch supporter of the Caspian Sea water transfer project as a â€œpermanentâ€ � solution .
Last month he said there was â€œno other optionâ€ ¦ to meet water demand in , and transfer water to , Iranâ€ ™ s central desert , including Semnan provinceâ€ � .
The Caspian Sea project was initiated in 2012 during the administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It was shelved when Rouhani took office in 2013 due to concerns raised by the department of environment but is now back on the table and at planning stage .
A 460 km ( 285 miles ) underground pipeline would be installed , with pump stations to send water up over 2000 meters to cross the Alborz Mountains .
The water would go as far as Qom , Kashan , and Isfahan , and eastward toward Khorasan .
This , say proponents , would avoid water rationing in the cities and ease acute shortages threatening to cripple fragile agricultural communities and ruin ecosystems .
Transferring water from the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman is even more ambitious in aiming to secure drinking water for 47 million people in 16 provinces .
In March 2016 , Rouhani announced a budget of $ 400 m to launch the initiative .
Hamidreza Janbaz , managing director of Iranâ€ ™ s National Water and Wastewater Engineering Company , a state body , has explained the scheme as several sub - projects that are at different stages .
Most are still in planning but some have broken ground , including water transfer from the Sea of Oman to the northern part of Sistan - Baluchistan province .
But as construction begins , a simple question remains .
Is pumping desalinised water from hundreds of kilometres away a sustainable way to support dehydrated mega - cities and parched farmlands ?
The countryâ€ ™ s
water and natural resources experts say no .
They object on both economic and environmental grounds .
Some academics and environmental activists have demanded the Caspian Sea project be scrapped because of the likely consequences of deforestation , and habitat and biodiversity loss , in the Hyrcanian forests , the steppe and alpine ecosystems of the Alborz Mountains , and in the Caspian Sea itself .
They are also concerned that Iran might set a precedent for Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , Russia and Turkmenistan , the four countries also adjoining the land - locked Caspian Sea .
Some of those opposing water transfer projects argue that the plans contravene article 50 of Iranâ€ ™ s constitution , which makes environmental sustainability a public duty , forbidding â€œeconomic and other activities that inevitably involve pollution of the environment or cause irreparable damage.â€ �
The dichotomy of water management and environmental sustainability is hardly new .
But it is growing .
Water shortages result from a mix of rapid population growth , disproportionate spatial distribution of people , inefficient agriculture , mismanagement and thirst for development .
With a mere 250 mm ( 1o inches ) of rain a year , less than a third of the global average , Iran is generally dry .
Over many decades , the country has been tempted by grandiose , supply - oriented engineering solutions such as dam construction and water transfer tunnels to secure water supply .
But Iran should already have learned that inter - basin transfers - moving water from one geographic region to another , typically over long distances â€ “ are no panacea .
A series of water diversions from the western headwaters of the Karoun river over a few decades more than doubled the natural flow of the Zayandeh - Rud river , a major surface water source for a strategic socio - economic hub in central Iran , but this promoted unbridled development and encouraged people to move in .
As a consequence , scarcity reappeared just years after each project was finished , while downstream the Gav - Khouni marsh faced a reduced flow inadequate to maintain aquatic habitats .
Overall , the Zayandeh - Rud projects made the situation worse , not better .
Once a source of pride , largescale supply - oriented solutions are now being understood as a major cause of environmental degradation , manifested in drying up of Lake Urmia , the Middle Eastâ€ ™ s largest saltwater lake , and in dust storms and haze in the west and southwest .
Furthermore , declining groundwater resources are a clear sign of unsustainable management and national â€œwater bankruptcyâ€ � whereby withdrawals exceed natural aquifer recharge .
The magnitude of the planned water - transfer projects means that any miscalculations can leave deep , lasting scars .
Scepticism is reinforced by past failures .
The Gotvand Dam ( in Khuzestan province was built on salt beds that make the water in the reservoir too salty to use :
the planning phase failed to detect that the geology would not permit the storage of water suitable for irrigation .
These are complex issues and pressures are real on government to ensure drinking water and encourage agricultural and industrial development in the central provinces .
Around the world , other desperate governments â€ “ as in Brazil and China â€ “ are looking for solutions based on water transfers .
But it is still possible to implement a host of water management strategies to alleviate water scarcity before slashing the country with lavish projects .
These include appropriate water pricing , incentives for conservation , improving farming technologies and practices , capturing stormwaters , reducing leakage in aging distribution networks , limiting groundwater withdrawal , and recycling waste water .
Interbasin transfer of desalinised water is one of the less favourable options .
It should be used only as a last resort .

2016-05-12,"An attempt by the US and UK governments to persuade European banks to do more business in Iran in the wake of last yearâ€ ™ s nuclear deal , appears to have fallen on deaf ears .
Senior representatives from nine major banks listened on Thursday to appeals from the US secretary of state , John Kerry , and the British foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , urging them to help finance expanded trade with Iran following the lifting of sanctions under the agreement sealed in Vienna last July .
As its part of the bargain , Tehran dismantled much of the infrastructure of its nuclear programme , but the government of President Hassan Rouhani has come under intense pressure recently from Iranian hardliners as the economic benefits have failed to live up to expectations .
But banking representatives said the verbal encouragement had done little to ease their concerns or clarify the continuing complexity and uncertainty surrounding trade with Iran .
They pointed out that while Washington and Europe had lifted some sanctions , there was still a ban on the use of dollars in the US banking system to finance Iranian trade , and individual US states have defied the federal government on some sanctions relief .
â€œWhat weâ€ ™ re trying to address is a gap between the undoubted political commitment of the US to make this agreement work in practice , to allow Iran to access the worldâ€ ™ s trade system and the worldâ€ ™ s finance system and the reality of what the European banks are finding in practice , â€ �
Hammond said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re trying to bridge that gap , weâ€ ™ re trying to understand where the disconnects are between the political intention and the banking reality and work together to see how we can bridge them.â€ �
Kerry said he wanted to â€œclarify and put to rest misinterpretations or mere rumours about how [ the deal ] is appliedâ€ � .
The secretary of state said : â€œWe want to make it clear that legitimate business , which is clear under the definition of the agreement , is available to banks .
As long as they do their normal due diligence and know who theyâ€ ™ re dealing with , theyâ€ ™ re not going to be held to some undefined and inappropriate standard here.â€ �
A British banking official said the meeting had gone â€œrelatively wellâ€ � but had not changed â€œissues that have been of longstanding and major concern to the banking
industryâ€ � .
He pointed to a lack of clarity on how federal and state governments apply the new regulations , and to the approaching US presidential elections in November .
â€œThat could change the approach , so thereâ€ ™ s a degree of caution , â€ � the official said .
One of the banks who took part in the meeting , Standard Chartered , made clear its position had not changed .
â€œWe were happy to share the practical and legal considerations behind our stated position on Iran with the secretary of state and the foreign secretary at the meeting today : we will not accept any new clients who reside in Iran , or which are an entity owned or controlled by a person there , nor will we undertake any new transactions involving Iran or any party in Iran , â€ �
a bank spokesman said .
Standard Chartered is currently facing fines for past activities alleged to have contravened the former sanctions .
â€œWe continue to cooperate fully with the US authorities in their ongoing investigations .
We remain unable to determine when these investigations will conclude or the size of any potential fines that might result , â€ � the spokesman said ."
2016-06-14,"Seventy distinguished academics from North American universities have urged the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , to break his silence over the ongoing house arrests of the countryâ€ ™ s opposition leaders .
In a letter written on the seventh anniversary of the disputed 2009 presidential election , the signatories asked Rouhani to use his position as the highest elected official in Iran to speak out about the plight of Mir Hossein Mousavi , his wife Zahra Rahnavard and Mehdi Karroubi .
The three critics have been confined to their homes since their movements were restricted without trial in February 2011 .
Mousavi and Karroubi were among the four presidential candidates in the 2009 vote , the disputed result of which gave Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term in office .
While acknowledging Rouhaniâ€ ™ s limited ability to intervene in the affairs of the judiciary , which acts independently of his administration , the academics said the president should speak out to protest what they called a â€œgrave miscarriage of justiceâ€ � .
â€œFor over six years , they have faced the hardships of unwarranted punishment , and all three suffer from multiple ailments .
They are , respectively , 79 , 75 and 71,â€ � read the letter , first published by the Guardian on Tuesday .
â€œFirst and foremost , ours is an ethical and humanitarian plea.â€ � MITâ€ ™ s Noam Chomsky , City University of New Yorkâ€
™ s
Ervand Abrahamian and Duke Universityâ€ ™
s
Mohsen Kadivar are among the signatories .
â€œNo legal system among nations , including Islamic law that forms the basis of the legal system in the Islamic Republic of Iran , justifies the punishment of citizens without due legal process .
Placing political dissidents under house arrest is a transparent example of such persecution .
â€œWhat compels us to address our letter to you is to protest against your silence toward this grave miscarriage of justice .
Unless and until effective steps are taken by your administration to address this situation , including preparing the grounds for a public legal trial of the accused in a credible court , the international community will not be convinced of your administrationâ€ ™ s resolve to make effective domestic reforms.â€ � Mousavi and Rahnavardâ€ ™ s house , down a dead - end alley in Tehran called Akhtar , is under constant heavy guard by the police .
Karroubi is enduring similar circumstances in the Jamaran neighbourhood in north Tehran .
They have largely been kept incommunicado , although recently they have been allowed regular visits by some immediate family members .
There are serious concerns about their health : an image of Mousavi that emerged in May 2014 showed him in a Tehran hospital bed due to a heart condition .
Speaking to the Guardian on Tuesday , Karroubiâ€ ™ s son said there had been little change in his fatherâ€ ™ s situation .
â€œTwo years and four months ago , my father was transferred to his private residence in Jamaran after previously being kept in accommodation belonging to the intelligence apparatus , â€ � Mohammad - Taghi Karroubi said .
â€œNot much has changed .
The guards stay in the lower floor , while my dad lives in the upper floor with my mum .
Family visits by his children [ and ] his access to newspapers have got slightly better , but apart from that the situation is the same , â€ � he said .
Unlike Rahnavard , Karroubiâ€ ™ s wife , Fatemeh , is currently allowed to leave the house .
Karroubi has undergone six operations since his movements have been restricted , his son said , five of which derive from problems related to his house arrest .
In a separate letter published by the opposition website Kaleme on Tuesday , Narges Mohammadi , a prominent human - rights activist who is currently imprisoned , asked Rouhani to protest against the continuing harassment and persecution of civil - rights activists in the country .
A revolutionary court in Tehran recently condemned Mohammadi to a 16-year jail sentence on top of the six - year term she is serving , in spite of condemnation from the UN and other international groups .
The full letter 12 June 2016 To the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran His Excellency , Dr Hasan Rouhani , We , the undersigned , a group of university professors in North America , would like to bring a humanitarian request to your attention in your capacity as the highest elected official of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
We request your urgent attention to the continued house arrest of Mir Hossein Mousavi , Mehdi Karroubi , and Zahra Rahnavard , three prominent political critics of the Islamic Republic of Iran who have been placed under house arrest since February 2011 .
For over six years , they have faced the hardships of unwarranted punishment , and all three suffer from multiple ailments .
They are , respectively , 79 , 75 and 71 .
First and foremost , ours is an ethical and humanitarian plea .
Recalling that during the elections of 2013 you introduced yourself as a man committed to upholding the rule of law , we find it most suitable to request that you address this issue as such .
No legal system among nations , including Islamic law that forms the basis of the legal system in the Islamic Republic of Iran , justifies the punishment of citizens without due legal process .
Placing political dissidents under house arrest is a transparent example of such persecution .
Mir Hossein Mousavi has been the last person to hold the office of prime minister in the Islamic Republic of Iran from 1981 to 1989 ; Mehdi Karroubi headed the Islamic consultative council ( the Iranian parliament ) ( 1989 - 92 and 2000 - 04 ) ; and Ms Zahra Rahnavard has served as rector of Al - Zahra Womenâ€ ™ s University in Tehran , 1998 - 2006 .
Mr Karroubi and Mr Mousavi both had run for president in 2009 , and like a sizeable part of the nationâ€ ™ s populace they protested against what they considered malfeasance and fraud in the electoral process .
The fact that responsible criticism from such high - profile individuals is not tolerated in the Islamic Republic of Iran indicates the difficulty ordinary citizens face in voicing their criticism of the political process in Iran .
We acknowledge that lifting the detention imposed on these individuals goes beyond the authority of the executive branch in the Islamic Republic .
What compels us to address our letter to you is to protest against your silence toward this grave miscarriage of justice .
Unless and until effective steps are taken by your administration to address this situation , including preparing the grounds for a public legal trial of the accused in a credible court , the international community will not be convinced of your administrationâ€ ™ s resolve to make effective domestic reforms .
Mr President , we implore you to take immediate and effective measures to end the house arrest against Mir Hossein Mousavi , Zahra Rahnavard and Mehdi Karroubi .
We also ask you to honor your pledge and to bring about the release of all the other unjustly incarcerated political prisoners .
As stated in Mr Karroubiâ€ ™ s open letter of April 9 , 2016 , should the lifting of his house arrest fall beyond your ability , we request that at least the accused are granted their day in court to defend themselves .
Thank you for your earnest attention .

2016-06-17,"Revelations that senior Iranian government employees were being paid astronomical salaries have rocked the country and threatened popular support for the president , Hassan Rouhani , amid Iranâ€ ™ s continued economic stagnation , little improved by the lifting of international sanctions in January .
The revelations , which have sparked widespread anger , have continued to dominate front pages across the country , and even led to the resignation of the head of the state insurance regulator , Mohammad Ebrahim Amin .
The scandal first erupted two months ago when a series of payslips surfaced online , which showed a number of top executives at the state insurance company were being paid monthly wages roughly 50 times higher than the lowest government salary .
This week , Rouhani instructed his vice - president , Eshaq Jahangiri , to launch an inquiry into the inflated salaries , and other exorbitant payments made to government officials .
Rouhaniâ€ ™
s opponents have sought to capitalise on the scandal to attack the president , who is already under pressure to demonstrate the economic benefits of last yearâ€ ™ s nuclear deal .
In a letter to his vice - president , Rouhani sought to deflect blame to previous administrations for the high salaries .
â€œReports show that some unconventional payments , bonuses or loans have been paid , â€ � he wrote , according to the Isna news agency .
â€œThose payments may have been compatible with the regulations left from previous administrations but nevertheless are unacceptable based on the ethical and fair values of this government.â€ �
Before stepping down from his position , Amin had attempted to explain away the salaries , claiming that the leaked payslips showed disproportionately high salaries because they included employeesâ€ ™ back pay , owed from previous years .
But his comments did little to quell nationwide outrage , amid new and continuing revelations about inflated salaries in other government departments .
It is not known who leaked the insurance companyâ€ ™ s payslips , which in one case showed a payout of more than 870 m rials ( Â£17,400 ) in a single month .
The lowest monthly government salary is estimated to be about 9 m rials ( Â£180 ) .
Under Iranian law , the highest salary for a government employee can not be more than 10 times that of its lowest .
The scandal comes at a delicate time for Rouhani , who has come under increasing pressure to boost the countryâ€ ™ s economy , an expected outcome of securing the nuclear agreement and the subsequent lifting of sanctions .
Despite the foreign currency exchange market gaining some stability , the Iranian economy has remained stagnant , with workers throughout the country protesting for higher wages and pensions in recent months .
According to David Lipton , a senior official with the IMF who recently visited Tehran , Rouhani has successfully brought down the inflation rate from 45 % in 2013 , the year he was elected , to its current rate of 8 % .
Lipton praised Rouhaniâ€ ™ s efforts to restore macroeonomic stability under difficult circumstances .
But the countryâ€ ™ s economic woes persist .
Having weathered a revolution and an eight - year war , Arj , Iranâ€ ™ s oldest manufacturer of electrical appliances , is the latest household name to face bankruptcy ."
2016-08-02,"Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has ordered the postponement of annual exams for the recruitment of government employees after it emerged that the vacancies advertised had discriminated against women .
Thousands of people were scheduled to sit a nationwide entry test next month for about 3,000 job offers in the state sector , including roles for teachers , nurses , computer programmers and prison guards .
But newspaper reports revealed that gender quotas were heavily favourable towards men , with more than 30 % of the vacancies ( 961 jobs ) open to men only , compared with 16 % for women only , with all managerial roles exclusive to men .
In his weekly meeting with cabinet members this week , Rouhani ordered the quotas to be reviewed in order to make sure they were consistent with his governmentâ€ ™ s policies of being inclusive towards women .
Rouhani ran for office on promises of improving womenâ€ ™ s rights in Iran , and has made significant efforts to do so , including by appointing Shahindokht Molaverdi as his vice - president for women and family affairs .
It was as a result of Molaverdi â€ “ who has won the support of some of Iranâ€ ™ s most respected womenâ€ ™ s rights campaigners but has come under pressure from hardliners
â€ “ raising the issue that the president intervened in the row .
Last year , Iran appointed its first female ambassador since the 1979 revolution and a record number of women entered the Iranian parliament after Februaryâ€ ™ s elections .
But discriminatory laws persist and equality remains a long way off .
Official figures from two years ago showed that fewer than four million women were at work in Iran , compared with 20 million men .
Women are required to wear the hijab and , in court , their testimony is worth half that of a man .
Mehrangiz Kar , an Iranian womenâ€ ™ s rights activist , welcomed Rouhaniâ€ ™ s decision but said she was not sure how far he could push the issue .
â€œTo what extent he can succeed is contingent on the pressure from other institutions that favour discrimination against women , â€ � she told the Guardian .
Kar said the supreme council of the cultural revolution , which is tasked with determining policies on women , especially their employment , is dominated by hardliners and reflects the views of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Many influential institutions in Iran , such as the Revolutionary Guards and the judiciary , act independently of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government .
â€œKhamenei has repeatedly voiced concerns that employment of women should not harm what he defines as their primary role of taking care of children at home , â€ �
she said .
â€œThe institutions that are close to hardliners and radical factions have a great deal of influence over womenâ€ ™ s employment in Iran.â€ �
According to Kar , the high rate of unemployment among women in Iran , as well as divorce and an increase in the number of single mothers , has become a â€œsocio - political pressureâ€ � on the Iranian establishment .
â€œIn his final months in office , Rouhani is taking measures to address some of the promises he has made , â€ � she said .
â€œWhat has been revealed about the gender quotas is very telling , even many womenâ€ ™ s rights campaigners did not know the full scale.â€ � Womenâ€ ™ s rights in Iran have also suffered from a serious setback after the authorities last year reversed the countryâ€ ™ s progressive laws on family planning by outlawing voluntary sterilisation and restricting access to contraceptives ."
2016-09-20,"The case of a British - Iranian mother detained on accusations of spying in Iran has been raised by Theresa May at her first meeting with the countryâ€ ™ s president .
May is understood to have questioned the five - year prison sentence given to Nazanin Zaghari - Ratcliffe at a meeting with the Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , at the United Nations in New York .
Last year Britain reestablished diplomatic relations with Iran for the first time since the storming of the embassy in Tehran , with David Cameron meeting Rouhani at the general assembly .
May is continuing a policy of engagement but raised a number of consular cases of concern with Rouhani .
The most high - profile is that of Zaghari - Ratcliffe , an employee of the Thomson Reuters Foundation , the news agencyâ€ ™ s charitable arm , who was sentenced this year on charges that remain secret but are said to include spying .
Zaghari - Ratcliffe , 37 , who was accused of plotting to topple the Iranian regime , was arrested at Imam Khomeini airport on 3 April as she was trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her daughter , Gabriella .
A UK official said : â€œWe think it is important with all the relations we have around the world that we can engage frankly where there are issues that need resolving .
Our view is if we are going to have a productive relationship with Iran â€ ¦ then we should all be able to raise such issues and discuss them.â€ �"
2016-10-04,"The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , has given a damning assessment of human rights in Iran , highlighting the â€œalarming rateâ€ � of executions and saying little progress has been made under president Hassan Rouhani .
In spite of his achievements on the international front , most notably reaching last yearâ€ ™ s landmark nuclear deal , Rouhaniâ€ ™ s
promises of domestic improvements have stalled in the face of resistance from hardliners .
Banâ€ ™ s 19-page report , released this week , says he remains â€œdeeply troubledâ€ � by accounts â€œof executions , floggings , arbitrary arrests and detentions , unfair trials , denial of access to medical care and possible torture and ill - treatmentâ€ � .
It adds : â€œHe is also concerned about continued restrictions of public freedoms and the related persecution of civil society actors , the persistence of discrimination against women and minorities and conditions of detention.â€ � Rights violations in Iran are largely carried out by a hardline judiciary and an intelligence apparatus that acts independently of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government .
But as the public face of the country , the president still has a huge influence and critics say he has put the issue on the backburner .
The governmentâ€ ™ s intelligence ministry has also handled a number of cases that have come under fire .
The UN says the rate of executions in Iran â€ “ at least 966 people were sent to the gallows last year â€ “ remains a huge source of concern .
Most of the executions are related to drug offences but
trials â€œfall short of the international fair standardsâ€ � , Banâ€ ™ s report finds .
Despite reforms in the penal code , Iranian courts continue to sentence juvenile offenders to death in defiance of international treaties , it adds .
This week , at least 100 MPs in Tehran put their names to a proposal to commute the death sentences of such drug smugglers to prison terms , but it is unclear how successful it will be .
Iranâ€ ™ s judiciary chief said last week that it was not possible to abolish the death penalty for drug offenders .
Banâ€ ™ s report also highlights the plight of journalist and human rights activist Narges Mohammadi , who recently had her 16-year jail sentence upheld in an appeals court .
Mohammadi is locked up partly because of allegations of â€œestablishing and running the illegal splinter group Legamâ€ � , a grassroots organisation advocating the abolition of the death penalty in Iran .
The deteriorating conditions in Iranian prisons â€ “ where the use of solitary confinement is widespread and many prisoners , especially those held on political grounds or because of their beliefs , are at times denied proper medical treatment
â€ “ is also criticised by the UN chief .
Mohammad Ali Taheri has been in solitary confinement since May 2011 for establishing a spiritual group called Erfan - e Halgheh and promoting beliefs and practices that the authorities deem un - Islamic .
Sources close to Taheri have said he is planning a hunger strike in protest at the authoritiesâ€ ™ refusal to release him .
Members of Iranâ€ ™ s BahÃ¡â€ ™ Ã­ community , described as â€œthe most severely persecuted religious minorityâ€ � in the country , face discrimination in various areas , including access to higher education or simply work .
Last month , at least 14 BahÃ¡â€ ™ Ã­s were arrested in the city of Shiraz .
Faraz Karin - Kani Sisa , 19 , was the latest BahÃ¡â€ ™ Ã­ student to be expelled from university because of his faith .
Another man , Kamran Aghdasi - Yekta from Hamadan , had his motor - maintenance shop shut for four years because he was a BahÃ¡â€ ™ Ã­."
2016-10-27,"The west risks breaching the landmark nuclear agreement if it fails to give Iran proper access to the international financial system , a former British ambassador to Iran has argued .
Sir Richard Dalton , who served in Tehran between 2003 and 2006 , said in a report published this week in the journal of the Royal Society of Asian Affairs in London that the US and its allies had made â€œsome potentially significant mistakesâ€ � in respect to reconnecting Iran to global banks after the deal .
Hassan Rouhani , under pressure to show tangible benefits of the lifting of sanctions to Iranians before the next presidential vote in 2017 , complained at the UN in September that the US was failing to fulfil its obligations .
The Iranian presidentâ€ ™ s comments were echoed by the head of the countryâ€ ™ s Atomic Energy Organisation , Ali Akbar Salehi , who told the Guardian last month that â€œthere are hints to do away [ with ] or to rewrite the deal , and on the other hand to unilaterally impose excessive oversighting and overcompliance to the point of Iranâ€ ™ s discouragement and ultimate submission.â€ � Daltonâ€ ™ s article , published on the first anniversary of the nuclear deal coming into effect , stated that the nuclear deal was the product of diplomacy .
Noting that the nuclear agreement would only endure â€œif everyone works at itâ€ � , Dalton wrote that â€œcommon sense suggests that , if the situation is not appreciably better later in the year , it will be impossible for the US and its partners to argue credibly that they are not in breach
ofâ€ � the nuclear deal , which is known in Iran by the acronym Barjam .
According to Dalton , the US and its partners have notably failed to re - authorise Iranâ€ ™ s access to U - turn transactions [ used by Iranian banks to avoid US sanctions ] in dollars , or to reassure non - US banks on handling Iranian payments , or to give general licences allowing non - US entities to use US software in their businesses dealings in Iran .
Banks have remained reluctant to enter Iran despite attempts by the US secretary of state , John Kerry , and his European counterparts .
Among other impediments are â€œunwillingness [ by the west ] , apparently , to use governmental influence with state - owned banks to get them to help carry out government policyâ€ � such as â€œproviding clearing facilities in Londonâ€ � , Dalton said .
The ongoing banking difficulties have prevented Iran from capitalising on interest shown by western businesses in returning to the country , or finalising lucrative deals with the west , such as the purchase of planes from Airbus and Boeing .
Iran is also partly to blame because it does not have adequate regulations on transparency , anti - corruption and money laundering .
Esfandyar Batmanghelidj , founder of the Europe - Iran Forum business conference series , said the mood in Tehran was mixed .
â€œOn one hand , major multinationals like Siemens , Peugeot , Unilever and Vodafone have signalled ambitious plans for Iran , generating optimism in Iranâ€ ™ s business community , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œOn the other hand , there are frustrating gaps in the US Office of Foreign Assets Controlâ€
™ s licensing policy .
OFAC has issued so - called â€˜general licencesâ€ ™ to help open the door for non - US companies to trade with Iran , but these provisions use broad language and do not fully account for the complexity of trade and investment by multinational companies.â€ �
Dalton served in the British Foreign Office for more than 35 years and was among a group of former western ambassadors to Tehran who co - penned an article in 2011 saying there was â€œno evidence that the country is building nuclear weaponsâ€ � and urging dialogue .
He is currently an associate fellow at the London thinktank Chatham House .
Dalton predicted that the nuclear agreement would last â€œprovided that mutual benefit is delivered in practiceâ€ � and that the US â€œuses its power wiselyâ€ � .
Iran would not be the first to renege , he argued , saying that â€œthe overwhelming interest of Iran is to complyâ€ � .
â€œThe nuclear deal will stick , subject to US policy .
And even if a Republican wins in the US , it is not a foregone conclusion that a candidatesâ€ ™ hostility to perceived past â€˜concessionsâ€ ™ to Iran would translate into active sabotage of the deal â€ “
it is too obviously a good agreement for US , regional and world security against the spread of nuclear weapons.â€ �
A Donald Trump presidency would be unlikely to change that , he said .
With Iranâ€ ™ s own elections scheduled for May , the moderate Rouhani faces a tough time ahead .
â€œHigh expectations in Iran of economic progress have not been realised .
Disappointment has set in and criticism of the limited benefits that have accrued to Iran by the supreme leader and by President Rouhaniâ€ ™ s opponents is rising in intensity ; 2017 will see a presidential election in Iran and the right scent Rouhaniâ€ ™ s blood.â€
�
Economically , Dalton viewed Iran as an emerging Bric country , alongside newly advanced economies such as Brazil and India .
â€œThey have a $ 1.4tn diversified economy , growing at some 4 - 5 % , with a backlog of investment in all sectors , a reforming government ( for the next year at least ) and a well - educated population ( total 80 million ) striving to take advantage of the countryâ€ ™ s improved prospects , â€ � he observed .
â€œCrude production will soon go above 4 m barrels per day .
The oil minister projects a production capacity of 4.8 m barrels per day within five years.â€
�
On the regional context , Dalton wrote that â€œwe should compare [ Iran ] not with post - Ottoman , post - imperial Egypt or Saudi Arabia , but with Russia and other Asian powers.â€ �"
2016-12-06,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , has said his country will not allow Donald Trump to tear up the landmark nuclear agreement with the west as he warned that an extension of sanctions , which passed Congress last week , could be a violation of the deal .
Trumpâ€ ™ s victory in the US presidential elections has raised questions about whether the landmark nuclear accord , signed in July 2015 , has a future .
Its fate could affect Rouhaniâ€ ™ s chances of re - election in May. â€œIran is the only country that , as our supreme leader [ Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ] stated , would neither mourn nor celebrate [ Trumpâ€ ™ s ] coming to power , â€ �
Rouhani said on Tuesday at Tehran University .
â€œWe would follow our own path.â€ �
Rouhani said the US president - elect â€œmay wish many things , he may wish to weaken or tear up Barjam ,
â€ � referring to the Persian acronym for the joint comprehensive plan of action ( or the nuclear deal ) ,
â€œbut will we and our nation allow such a thing ?
America can not influence our path of strength and endurance.â€ �
Iranian leaders have been unusually reserved in their reactions to Trumpâ€ ™ s win , refraining from bombastic pronouncements often used to denounce â€œthe Great Satanâ€ � .
Some politicians have been reflecting a view that Iran has historically coped better with the Republicans , but others have warned that Tehran should not underestimate Trump given his cabinet appointments so far filled with figures vociferous in their opposition to the country .
A vote last week in the US Senate to extend the Iran sanctions act for another 10 years has particularly infuriated Tehran , initiating a debate in the country about whether it amounted to a violation of the nuclear deal .
It passed 99 - 0 after clearing the House of Representatives in November .
Barack Obama is expected to sign the measure into a law , a White House official said , adding that the administration does not believe the extension violates the nuclear deal between major powers and Iran .
Rouhani said on Tuesday that a committee tasked with monitoring the implementation of the deal was reviewing whether the vote was in breach of it .
The Iranian president said Tehran would retaliate against the measures if they come to force .
Speaking about Iranâ€ ™ s negotiating partners , the group known as P5 + 1 â€ “ the UN security councilâ€ ™ s five permanent members : China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom and the United States , plus Germany â€ “ Rouhani said â€œsome are our friends and we have good relationship with themâ€ � , but he said the US was â€œour enemy , which is putting as much pressure on us as possibleâ€ � .
The president added : â€œ[The US ] may violate and is violating .
There are two scenarios in respect to the recent example of extending the Iran sanctions act ; if it comes to force it will be a clear and vivid breaching of Barjam , and they will see a harsh reaction from us , and our country is united in its reaction to breaching of the deal .
â€œEven if the US president signs the extension but waives it , we would still consider it a violation of the deal , and we would react , â€ �
he said , without clarifying how serious a violation that would be .
Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister and its chief nuclear negotiator , Mohammad Javad Zarif , also said at the weekend that the senate vote on the sanctions should Washington was unreliable .
â€œTo the world community , the extension of sanctions against Iran shows the unreliability of the American government , â€ �
he told the state television on Saturday .
â€œAmerica is acting against its commitment.â€ �
In his speech , Rouhani defended his administrationâ€ ™ s efforts in securing the nuclear agreement and said it was only acting on the orders of Khamenei .
Hardliners in Iran have been criticising Rouhani about the deal .
They say people in Iran have not seen the financial benefits of the agreement .
Rouhani disagreed .
â€œAt one point , we were only able to sell 970,000 to one million barrels of oil per day , but now it has reached the level of 2,300,000 barrels per day , â€ �
Rouhani said .
â€œIs this good or bad ?
The country â€ ¦ exports as much as it wants.â€
�
The Iranian president said the removal of nuclear - related sanctions had already borne fruit .
â€œIn regards to sanctions , except for banking restrictions , all sanctions have been removed 100%.â€ �"
2017-01-05,"The Nobel peace prize laureate Shirin Ebadi has called on the head of Iranâ€ ™ s judiciary to step down after a string of hunger strikes by political prisoners .
Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani is also facing mounting pressure from the government of Hassan Rouhani , which is demanding greater financial transparency .
Larijani was appointed by the supreme leader , can not be summoned by MPs for questioning and is not directly accountable to the public .
Under his watch the judiciary has made a number of high - profile arrests of dual nationals that are seen as undermining the president Rouhaniâ€ ™ s advances on foreign policy .
Ebadi , a human rights lawyer and womenâ€ ™ s rights activist living in exile in the UK , said she considered Larijani to be â€œdirectly responsible for the injustices and corruptionâ€ � in the system .
She said that â€œin the name of religion and with the excuse of national securityâ€ � , the judiciary was â€œoverseeing a miscarriage of justiceâ€ � .
â€œCivil and social activists and thinkers who voice criticism or protest are put in jail and condemned to lengthy prison sentences and torture and persecution , while criminals , serial killers and those involved in embezzlement continue to abuse people under the shadows of a corrupted judicial system , â€ � she said in a statement posted on the website of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre , of which she is president .
â€œA considerable number of prisoners are those held on political or religious grounds .
In what part of the world and according to what history , you would call this judicial system fair?â€ �
This week Arash Sadeghi , a student activist serving a 15-year prison sentence , ended a 71-day hunger strike over the detention of his wife , Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee , after she was released on bail .
Iraee had been sentenced to six years for writing an unpublished fictional story about stoning to death in Iran .
The case had sparked rare demonstrations near Tehranâ€ ™ s Evin prison .
Amnesty said Sadeghi had lost 20 kg ( 44lbs ) while on hunger strike , and it called on Iran to provide him with urgent specialised medical care for a kidney malfunction .
Other prisoners remain on hunger strike .
Ali Shariati , given a five - year sentence for what Amnesty said was â€œpeaceful activism , including his participation in a peaceful protest to condemn acid attacks against women in Iranâ€ � , has been refusing food since the end of October .
Saeed Shirzad , who is in jail for protesting against child labour , and Nizar Zakka , a Lebanese citizen and IT expert accused of spying for the US , are also on hunger strikes .
Tara Sepehri Far , of Human Rights Watch , echoed Ebadi in condemning Larijani .
â€œIranâ€ ™ s judiciary regularly violates the rights of political prisoners , often charging them under ill - defined national security crimes ,
â€ � she said .
â€œLarijani , as the head of the judiciary since 2009 , is ultimately responsible for this dismal record .
The reality in todayâ€ ™ s Iran is that the judiciary often acts as a fundamental obstacle to justice , even threatening parliamentarians who have called for due process for arrested human rights defenders , which only shatters public trust in the institution.â€ �
Amnestyâ€ ™ s Philip Luther said the Iranian authoritiesâ€ ™ treatment of Sadeghi had been deplorable .
â€œFirst they unjustly imprisoned him
, then they ignored his legitimate protest against his wifeâ€ ™ s unwarranted imprisonment for weeks , and now they are denying him urgent medical care , â€ �
he said .
â€œThey must stop endangering his health and his life and order his transfer to hospital immediately , pending his unconditional release.â€ �
Iranâ€ ™ s judiciary has repeatedly denied claims of violations , saying criticism voiced from the west is hypocritical and that the US and the UK remain mute about rights abuses committed by allies such as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain .
Larijani belongs to an influential family and he is seen as a potential candidate to succeed the supreme leader , Ayatollah Alli Khamenei .
One of his brothers is the head of Iranâ€ ™ s state - run human rights council ; another is the parliamentary speaker .
Recently Rouhani and Larijani have been at odds over financial transparency .
This week Rouhani tweeted that his government was prepared to make its income and expenses public ,
â€œbut on the other side , it also expects the judiciary to be transparent about its accounts tooâ€ � .
In November an Iranian MP questioned a minister over allegations that Larijani possessed 63 personal bank accounts filled with public funds .
The judiciary later attempted to arrest the MP but was unsuccessful .
Larijani has denied the allegations ."
2017-02-13,"Iranâ€ ™ s president has come under criticism for surrounding himself with an all - male entourage while hosting a predominantly female delegation visiting Tehran from Sweden .
Pictures of the meeting at Tehranâ€ ™ s presidential palace show a smiling Hassan Rouhani sitting opposite the Swedish prime minister , Stefan LÃ¶fven , who had six women accompanying him .
One Twitter user addressed Rouhani directly online , asking in Persian : â€œHow would you feel seeing this photo?â€ � Golnaz Esfandiari , an Iranian journalist , also criticised the photograph on Twitter .
Sussan Tahmasebi , an award - winning Iranian womenâ€ ™ s rights activist , said the abundant presence of women in the Swedish delegation sent a powerful message to Iran .
â€œThe sensitivity around this issue is important because women should have been present among the Iranian delegation , â€ �
she said .
Rouhani has a number of women in his cabinet serving as his vice - presidents , including Shahindokht Molaverdi , who has been outspoken about womenâ€ ™ s rights , but no female ministersâ€ “ and none accompanied him at Saturdayâ€ ™ s panel .
LÃ¶fven met Molaverdi in a separate meeting in Tehran on Sunday .
In 2015 Rouhaniâ€ ™ s foreign ministry appointed Iranâ€ ™ s first female ambassador since the 1979 Islamic revolution , marking a breakthrough for women in government .
Leila Alikarami , who monitors womenâ€ ™ s rights in Iran , said Rouhaniâ€ ™ s all - male delegation was particularly disappointing given his campaign promises to promote the cause .
â€œMolaverdi has a long experience in womenâ€ ™ s affairs but she is not given enough powers , â€ �
Alikarami said , referring to the vice president .
â€œShe faces a lot of obstacles .
Womenâ€ ™ s rights is not this
systemâ€
™ s
priority , it only comes up at election time.â€ �
Alikarami also said the visiting female diplomats should not have been forced to wear hijabs .
â€œThere should be a freedom of choice for all women , â€ � she said .
â€œThey should not face discrimination because of their gender.â€ �
Wearing the hijab has been an integral policy of the Islamic republic ever since the 1979 revolution and foreign female visitors from prime ministers to celebrities have adhered to it while on Iranian territory .
Members of the Swedish delegation , particularly trade minister Ann Linde , faced criticism in Sweden for covering their hair .
But Tahmasebi said it was important for the women to attend .
â€œIf
[ the ] Swedish women hadnâ€
™ t gone to Tehran , the meeting would have taken place without them , but with male officials .
Itâ€ ™ s important that Iran would have relations with Sweden , a country that pursues feministic foreign policy , â€ � she added .
It is not the first time this year that the Swedish government has drawn applause for its gender equality .
Earlier this month Swedenâ€ ™ s
deputy prime minister , Isabella Lovin , posted a photograph of herself and her female colleagues after she signed a bill protecting the environment .
The image was widely shared online and taken as a wry comment on pictures of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s all - male Oval Office team ."
2017-04-09,"Iran is bracing for a heated and divisive election season after a powerful conservative cleric threw himself into the presidential race to challenge the moderate incumbent , Hassan Rouhani .
Official registration for candidacy begins on Tuesday but Ebrahim Raisi , who is a close ally of the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has upended the race with a surprise declaration that he would put his name on the list .
He said in a statement on Sunday he had been reluctant to seek office but had made the decision to run after he deemed it to be his â€œreligious and revolutionary responsibilityâ€ � .
Over the past year , Raisi has been touted as a frontrunner to become Khameneiâ€ ™ s successor , a higher position than that of the president .
His bid for presidency has puzzled Iranian political commentators about his intentions and what his candidacy would mean for Rouhani , who is expected to seek re - election .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s four predecessors have all served two consecutive terms , which is allowed under the Iranian constitution , but Raisiâ€ ™ s candidacy is an indication that the current president will not have an easy ride ahead .
Elections are scheduled for 19 May.
It also comes amid serious concerns about attempts within the Iranian establishment to disqualify Rouhani in the pre - elections vetting process , in effect blocking him from running .
While disqualifying a sitting president would likely create a huge backlash , authorities have succeeded in preventing other influential figures from running in recent years .
A statement posted on Sunday on Raisiâ€ ™ s official website to announce his bid said he has sought to tackle Iranâ€ ™ s economic troubles .
â€œThe Islamic establishment is
four decadesâ€ ™ old and while we have had achievements and progress , people are still suffering from chronic structural problems and mismanagement which are preventing the government from responding to peopleâ€ ™ s demands and fulfilling constitutional aims .
â€œCanâ€ ™ t we resolve issues such as recession , unemployment and obstacles in the way of businesses ? ...
I deeply believe that this can change.â€
�
A group of influential conservatives in Iran , operating under the umbrella coalition known as the Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces , or Jamna , held party conferences in the past weeks to shortlist their favourite nominees .
Raisi received more votes than any other figure in their list of top five nominees , which also included the Tehran mayor , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf .
While all five might register as candidates , many are expected to drop out later in favour of Jamnaâ€ ™ s final favourite .
Meanwhile , Iranâ€ ™ s former hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has been blocked by Khamenei to run , has formally backed his ex - deputy , Hamid Baghaei .
Baghei was arrested in 2015 on unspecified charges and it is not clear if he would be allowed to run if he registers as a candidate .
The Guardian Council , a powerful body of clerics and jurists close to Khamenei , would have to vet all candidates before any election in Iran .
Reformists , who have been sidelined in recent years , are expected to back Rouhani .
Former president Mohammad Khatami , the leader of the reformist movement who is banned from any media coverage , has indicated that Rouhani is the reformistsâ€ ™ favourite .
The Guardian understands that many reformists believe that they should nominate a second candidate to shadow and ultimately server as a substitute for Rouhani in case he is disqualified or otherwise drops out .
Sources said Rouhani was opposed to the idea and believed more reformist candidates would increase the possibility of him being disqualified .
The establishment would be reluctant to block him if there were no other reformist candidate because the system usually avoids holding elections that are lackluster .
Raisi , 56 , is the custodian of Astan Quds Razavi , the wealthiest charity in the Muslim world and the organisation in charge of Iranâ€ ™ s holiest shrine .
He had barely reached adulthood by the 1979 Islamic revolution but rose quickly through the ranks .
In the summer of 1988 , he was one of the four sharia judges behind the mass execution of leftists and dissidents .
More recently he was Iranâ€ ™ s prosecutor general .
Mohammad Taghi Karroubi , an Iranian political analyst and the son of an opposition leader under house arrest , Mehdi Karroubi , said Mayâ€ ™ s elections were important because â€œwhoever wins will undoubtedly have a role in the appointment of the next supreme leaderâ€ � .
He said : â€œThatâ€ ™ s why many are thinking of blocking Rouhani because without his presence they will have an upper hand in choosing the next leader when the time comes .
Thatâ€ ™ s why I fear Rouhani may be disqualified.â€ �
Karroubi said various scenarios have been explored about Raisiâ€ ™ s candidacy .
One theory is that he is registering to increase his public profile for a possible succession and would ultimately drop out .
Others think he is running to win , which will increase the possibility of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s disqualification because the president is believed to have more popular support if the two went head to head .
â€œRaisi hasnâ€ ™ t come for an easy defeat , â€ � Karroubi said .
If Raisi runs and loses , analysts say that would scupper his chances of succeeding Khamenei ."
2017-04-12,"Former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has registered to run in the presidential race next month , defying an edict from the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader not to do so .
Reporters with the Associated Press news agency described watching as stunned election officials processed the hardlinerâ€ ™ s paperwork on Wednesday .
The surprise decision will likely upend an election many believed would be won by the incumbent , Hassan Rouhani , a moderate who negotiated the nuclear deal with world powers .
It also makes Ahmadinejad the most high - profile Iranian politician to defy the wishes of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say in all state matters .
Last year , Khamenei took the unusual decision to reveal he had told Ahmadinejad he did not recommend he enter the contest .
â€œSomeone came to see me and considering his own interests and the interests of the country , I told him he should not participate in that matter [
elections],â€ �
Khamenei was quoted by his official website last year , referring to Ahmadinejad .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t tell him not to participate , I told him I wonâ€
™ t recommend him participating.â€
�
But in a news conference shortly after submitting his registration , Ahmadinejad described the comments by the supreme leader as â€œjust adviceâ€ � .
There was no immediate reaction from Khameneiâ€ ™ s office .
Ahmadinejad had initially said in a press conference in Tehran last week that he was formally backing a former deputy , Hamid Baghaei , and that he did not plan to run himself .
He previously served two four - year terms from 2005 to 2013 .
Under Iranian law , he became eligible to run again after four years out of office , but he remains a polarising figure , even among fellow hardliners .
Iranâ€ ™ s economy suffered under heavy international sanctions during his administration because of western suspicions that Tehran was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes .
His registration as a candidate is the second surprising announcement in Iranâ€ ™ s presidential race .
On Sunday , Ebrahim Raisi , a conservative cleric close to Khamenei , announced he would put his name on the list .
Over the past year , Raisi has been touted as a frontrunner to become Khameneiâ€ ™ s successor , a higher position than that of the president .
His run for the presidency has puzzled Iranian political commentators who are asking what his candidacy might mean for Rouhani , who is expected to seek re - election .
Raisiâ€ ™
s decision comes amid concerns about the possible disqualification of Rouhani in the vetting process .
The Guardian Council , a body of jurists and clerics who are close to Khamenei , vets all candidates before any elections in Iran , in a process that has been the subject of controversy .
There has been heated debate over whether the council has the constitutional footing to block candidates .
In recent years it has blocked many reformists and independents , as well as conservatives , from running in parliamentary and presidential elections .
Although Khamenei controversially sided with Ahmadinejad in a dispute over the 2009 presidential election , which prompted huge protests across the country , the relationship between the two was fraught in the final years of Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s presidency because of a power struggle at the height of the Islamic Republic .
Despite Khameneiâ€ ™ s advice , Ahmadinejad had been building a campaign in the months leading to the official registration â€
“ visiting provinces , becoming more active online and speaking at more occasions .
He recently joined Twitter .
More than 120 prospective candidates , including six women and seven clerics , submitted their names on the first day of registration on Tuesday .
Registration remains open until Saturday .
The election on 19 May is being seen by many in Iran as a referendum on the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers and its ability to improve the countryâ€ ™ s sanctions - hobbled economy .
Under that deal , Iran agreed to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .

2017-04-16,"Hassan Rouhani , Iranâ€ ™ s moderate president who is seeking re - election , faces a boisterous race after heavyweight conservative figures critical of his landmark nuclear agreement with the west put themselves up to challenge him .
Registration for candidates in Iranâ€ ™ s presidential elections next month ended on Saturday , with a record number of 1,636 people putting their names on the list , including 137 women .
On Friday , Rouhani took his ID card , a few passport - sized photos and other paperwork to the interior ministry in Tehranâ€ ™ s Fatemi Street to register to run for a second term .
His four predecessors have all served two conservative terms .
Ebrahim Raisi , a close ally of the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whose bid for presidency has upended the race , also registered on Friday .
The former hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Tehranâ€ ™ s mayor , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf , are among a handful of other serious candidates running .
The list of presidential hopefuls has been sent to the guardian council , a powerful body of jurists and clerics , which began a five - day vetting process on Sunday .
A limited number of candidates are usually allowed through .
Critics say the council has arbitrarily blocked many high - profile politicians in recent years , going beyond its constitutional responsibilities .
This year , all eyes are on the council to see if it will approve Ahmadinejad , who registered despite advice by Khamenei not to .
The campaign period starts on 28 April and ends one day before the vote , which is scheduled for 19 May. Ali Ansari , a professor of Iranian history at the University of St Andrews , said Raisiâ€ ™ s surprising decision to run has been â€œthe fly in the ointmentâ€ � in what could have been a relatively straightforward , albeit challenging , race for Rouhani to win a second term .
Raisiâ€ ™
s
rise to prominence over the past year has intrigued many commentators who speculate that he is being touted as a frontrunner to succeed Khamenei , a higher position than that of the president .
â€œI think definitely it has complicated the race , â€ � Ansari said .
â€œI think the fact that Raisi is coming , unless he steps aside , it looks very unlikely to me that the nezam [ ruling system ] would allow Raisi to be humiliated in an election .
He hasnâ€ ™ t come to lose .
He is an up - and - coming player in the system and in the last six months heâ€
™ s basically come from nowhere.â€ �
There are also concerns about Rouhaniâ€ ™ s possible disqualification .
That explains why his first deputy , Eshaq Jahangiri , a figure close to the reformists , also registered to run on Saturday .
â€œIâ€ ™ m here to supplement Rouhani , â€ �
he said , meaning that his bid for the presidency was tactical and that he would drop out if Rouhani is allowed to run .
â€œRouhani is not in as strong a position as we think he is , because he delivered the JCPOA [ nuclear deal ] .
JCPOA in Iran is not seen as a giant triumph , and for me the problem is the way Rouhani sold it , â€ � Ansari said .
â€œHe has stablised the economy , but I think he made a number of very exaggerated claims , and he is now paying the price in the popular mood .
But in an open election I think people would vote for Rouhani .
Rouhani is the best of a bad choice , but at the same time I donâ€
™ t think heâ€ ™ s as clear a winner as some people in the west would like to think.â€ �
Although women have registered , all female nominees have previously been blocked from running .
Azam Talaghani , a former MP and the daughter of a prominent revolutionary ayatollah , is among the women who have put their names on the list to test whether the authorities would allow women to run ."
2017-04-20,"Iranâ€ ™ s former hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been disqualified from running in Iranâ€ ™ s presidential elections next month , according to the final list of approved candidates announced on Thursday .
Iranâ€ ™ s interior ministry said that the guardian council â€ “ the group of influential jurists and clerics that vets all candidates â€ “ had approved six politicians to run , including the moderate incumbent , Hassan Rouhani .
Also on the list are Ebrahim Raisi , a close ally of the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader ; the mayor of Tehran , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf ; Rouhaniâ€ ™ s first deputy , Eshaq Jahangiri ; and relatively low - profile politicians Mostafa Agha Mirsalim and Mostafa Hashemi - Taba .
But the list excluded more than 1,600 other nominees who had applied to run for president , including all 137 female candidates â€ “ and Ahmadinejad .
The councilâ€ ™ s decision marks a new nadir in the deteriorating relationship between the Iranian establishment and Ahmadinejad , whose controversial re - election in 2009 plunged the country into crisis .
Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s exclusion means the presidential race will probably be a tight three - man race between Rouhani , Raisi and Ghalibaf .
Jahangiri has already announced that his candidacy is tactical and that he intends to eventually drop out in favour of Rouhani .
He is believed to have entered the race to help Rouhani to defend his legacy by buying more airtime in presidential debates and media opportunities .
Raisiâ€ ™ s surprise entry in the race earlier this month has threatened what many had expected would be a relatively straightforward bid by Rouhani for a second term .
After rapidly rising in prominence over the past year , he is being touted as a possible successor to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Raisi and Ghalibaf originally belonged to a coalition of conservatives known as the Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces , or Jamna , which said only one candidate would ultimately run .
But both men have distanced themselves from the coalition and it is still not clear if either will pull out in favour of the other .
Some analysts say a defeat would scupper Raisiâ€ ™ s chances of succeeding Khamenei and that he is therefore likely to drop out at the last minute .
Last week , Ahmadinejad surprised observers by registering to run in defiance of Khamenei who had told him to stay out of the race .
He had kept the decision secret and had said that he was only accompanying his former deputy , Hamid Baghaei , to the registration office for the latter to put his name forward .
While Baghaei was registering , Ahmadinejad stunned registration officials when he took his national ID out of his pocket and asked to apply .
Khamenei took Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s side in the unrest in the aftermath of his re - election in 2009 , but the relationship between the two grew fraught in the final years of Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s presidency .
He served two consecutive terms and oversaw a period of huge uncertainty amid international sanctions over Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
He still enjoys a considerable fanbase in Iran , mainly among conservatives , which means his disqualification could cost the establishment dearly .
Commentators say Ahmadinejad and his inner circle , who had been sidelined under Rouhani , may have their eyes on the period after Khamenei , who underwent prostate surgery in 2014 .
His disqualification could help him regain some of his credibility among a large constituency critical of the Iranian establishment .
Ahmadinejad joins an expanding list of former Iranian presidents who have fallen foul of the establishment following their departure from office .
The reformist former president , Mohammad Khatami , whose backing of Rouhani in 2013 was crucial in the current presidentâ€ ™ s election , also faces restrictions .
Media is banned from using his name or images , although the restrictions appear to have been relaxed as the 19 May elections approach .
Former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who died earlier this year , was blocked from running in the 2013 presidential elections , and Abolhassan Banisadr , Iranâ€ ™ s first post - revolutionary president , currently lives in exile .
There were some angry social media reactions after Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s exclusion .
â€œDisqualifying candidates is illegal .
If Ahmadinejad has committed a crime , why hasnâ€ ™ t been put on trial
all these years?,â€ � tweeted Iranian user @sahartwitt .
â€œWe are opposed to the disqualifications of the Guardian Council , itâ€ ™ s not right for the council to decide what the people are meant to decide.â€ �
Iranian poet Fatemeh Shams wrote on her Facebook page : â€œ[Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s ] eight years of presidency came at the cost of so much blood , imprisonment , house arrest and exile .
It took the [ supreme ] leader a long time to come to the very same conclusion as that of the Green movement supporters in 2009 .
And the leaders of the Green movement [ Mir - Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi ] are still under house arrest after 6 years .
What a dirty show.â€ �"
2017-05-04,"A candidate who entered the Iranian election race to help his boss , President Hassan Rouhani , is emerging as a favourite of reformists for his bold and outspoken campaign , even though he is ultimately expected to step aside .
Eshaq Jahangiri , the first vice - president , made clear when he registered as a candidate for the top job that he was â€œsupplementingâ€ � and not challenging the incumbent â€ “ indicating his campaign was a tactical move aimed at defending Rouhaniâ€ ™ s achievements .
The presidential election on 19 May is the first since the 2015 nuclear deal with the west , when Tehran rolled back its nuclear programme in exchange for the removal of sanctions .
None of the candidates have spoken of scrapping that accord but two conservatives â€ “
Tehranâ€ ™ s mayor , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf , and the hardliner Ebrahim Raisi â€ “ have questioned whether Rouhani has achieved tangible economic benefits .
Jahangiriâ€ ™ s strong appearance in the first of three televised debates boosted the reformists but Ghalibaf said it was a â€œstrange
phenomenonâ€ � that he was running alongside Rouhani .
Referring to the marginalisation of reformists after the 2009 disputed presidential vote , which gave hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term in office , Jahangiri responded : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a movement called the reformist movement and youâ€ ™ ve deprived them of all rights and now you are saying that they shouldnâ€ ™ t even have a candidate ?
â€œIâ€ ™
ve put myself up as a representative of the reformist movement to speak out â€
¦
They confined everyone to their houses .
They
[ Ahmadinejadâ€ ™ s government ] earned $ 700bn , they took it , they spent it and they left nothing , just unemployment.â€ �
Jahangiri has tried to portray Ghalibaf as a continuation of Ahmadinejad , condemning his â€œmilitaryâ€ � mindset .
On Tuesday night during a nationally televised address , an opportunity given to all candidates , he said : â€œPeople have not forgotten those days , people have to be careful and not forget the history .
People should be vigilant .
The history should not repeat itself in this way.â€ �
Hossein Rassam , a political analyst , said : â€œSomething particular about Jahangiri is that even if he is outperforming Rouhani , still at the end of the day itâ€ ™ s all attributed to Rouhani .
It all goes to Rouhani .
At the end of the day , heâ€ ™ s not challenging Rouhani , heâ€ ™ s come to Rouhaniâ€ ™ s support.â€ � Jahangiriâ€ ™ s role is particularly important because of his influence among reformists .
He is a close ally of the former president Mohammad Khatami , who endorsed Rouhani on Tuesday .
Khatami still has a huge influence despite falling foul of the establishment over the 2009 disputed elections .
In 2013 his backing and that of Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani were crucial in Rouhaniâ€ ™ s victory .
Last year , reformist - backed candidates supported by Khatami enjoyed a clean sweep of all 30 seats allocated to Tehran in the parliamentary elections .
Speaking to a group of reformists on Tuesday , Khatami said : â€œOur candidate is Rouhani .
The continuation of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government is in the best interests of the country â€ ¦ Rouhaniâ€
™ s failure would mean a return to the difficult years [ of international sanctions and isolation].â€ �
A number of former political prisoners have also thrown their weight behind Rouhani , including Bahareh Hedayat , who was released in September from prison after nearly seven years .
Rassam said an electorate mainly concerned about the countryâ€ ™ s economy no longer solely looked at political affiliation , and Jahangiri had impressed many voters , but mainly those whoâ€ ™ ve already made up their mind .
He said Ghalibaf appeared to be the main challenger to Rouhani and that Raisi was likely to drop out if he continued presenting himself as â€œthe sympathetic typeâ€ � and not a someone who can â€œgo and do the jobâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s definitely a tough ride for Rouhani .
Ghalibafâ€ ™
s chances of having bigger vote than last time are considerable , and for Rouhani itâ€ ™ s not that straightforward .
He has a big battle in front of him to fight.â€ �
Ghalibaf received 6 m votes in 2013 , compared with Rouhaniâ€ ™ s 18.6 m .
Rassam added : â€œRouhani has lost votes and there are people who are not very happy with his performance , not because his performance has not been good , itâ€ ™ s because he made a mistake : to get the nuclear deal he increased peopleâ€ ™ s expectations substantially , not realising afterwards that he would also have to deliver on those hopes.â€ �"
2017-05-05,"Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has used a presidential TV debate to accuse the countryâ€ ™ s powerful revolutionary guards of attempting to sabotage its nuclear agreement with the west by testing ballistic missiles with provocative anti - Israeli messages written on them .
The moderate cleric , who is seeking re - election in a six - man race scheduled for 19 May , came under attack about his administrationâ€ ™ s performance in Fridayâ€ ™ s three - hour - long televised debate focused on domestic and foreign policy .
But Rouhani defended his record , and accused his domestic opponents of rooting for Donald Trump .
â€œWe saw what they did in order to disrupt Barjam ,
â€ �
Rouhani said referring to the Persian acronym for the landmark nuclear agreement .
â€œThey wrote messages on the missiles so that we wonâ€ ™ t be able to reap its benefits , â€ � he said , mentioning the elite forceâ€ ™ s testing of two ballistic missiles in March 2016 , just two months after sanctions were lifted .
Written on those missiles was a message in Hebrew : â€œIsrael must vanish from the page of time.â€ �
It was a rare criticism of the guardsâ€ ™ conduct in public , which underscored the presidentâ€ ™ s frustration about Iranâ€ ™ s parallel , unelected bodies that act independently of his government .
None of the candidates spoke of scrapping the agreements , but two powerful conservatives , Tehran mayor Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf and hardliner Ebrahim Raisi , said that the deal had failed to bring tangible economic benefits to Iran .
â€œMr
Rouhani promised that all sanctions would be lifted after Barjam , but there was no change on peopleâ€ ™ s tables .
Did it solve the issue of recession and unemployment?â€ � asked Raisi , who is running on a campaign of â€œwork and dignityâ€ � .
Ghalibaf echoed Raisi : â€œWhat did it bring for our people ?
Barjam was there to improve peopleâ€ ™ s life
but people say rightly that nothing has changed.â€ �
Ghalibaf said the agreement only benefited the top 4 % wealthiest in the society and not the remaining 96 % , a concept he repeated many times during the debate , which Rouhani mocked as a copy of the US Occupy movementâ€ ™
s
slogan
â€œwe are the 99%â€ � .
Rouhani in turn asked his rivals to tell the electorate what they would do with the agreement and how they would deal with the international community .
â€œWhat were you doing behind the scenes [ as we were negotiating],â€ �
Rouhani asked Raisi .
â€œSome opponents said a lot of nonsense , they followed in the footsteps of Wahhabis , Zionists and hardline Americans in their opposition to the deal â€
¦ you were opposed to the deal from the beginning and when Trump took office , you were cheering that he would tear up the agreement apart.â€ �
Rouhani added : â€œIf we didnâ€ ™ t have [ the deal ] , our oil exports of about two million barrels per day would be reduced to 200,000 barrels per day .
People should know whether you will bring back sanctions and confrontation.â€ �
During the debate , Rouhani was helped by his first vice - president , Eshaq Jahangiri , who is also running , but is expected to drop out at last minute in favour of the president .
Jahangiri said the nuclear deal was â€œone of the biggest achievements of our historyâ€ � and that if it did not exist , â€œIranâ€ ™ s exports would have halted.â€ � Jahangiri , who is allied with the reformists , has been attracting attentions since the first TV debate last week , at times stealing the show from his boss .
â€œWe need to stop another adventure in our country , â€ � Jahangiri said .
â€œThis country can not tolerate another tension and political novices .
People should be vigilant .
What sort of future do you want for your kids ?
Do you want restrictions or freedom ?
Dignity or isolation ?
Tensions or peace?â€ �
Ghalibaf , who is emerging as Rouhaniâ€ ™ s main challenger , attacked Rouhani on many domestic issues , seizing upon a national row involving the daughter of a government minister he alleged had smuggled clothes from Italy â€ “ a charge denied by Rouhani .
Rouhani highlighted social freedoms in the debate and criticised the state television for blacklisting the countryâ€ ™ s most popular traditional singer , Mohammad - Reza Shajarian .
â€œWe need to continue the path of hope , we must not allow despair to prevail , â€ � he said ."
2017-05-12,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , has taken a combative tone in campaigning as conservative rivals pull out all the stops to prevent him from being re - elected .
The favourite among reformists of the six candidates running for president on 19 May , Rouhani has crossed red lines in Iranian politics with attacks on the elite Revolutionary Guards and the characterisation of one of his main challengers as someone whose only talent was execution and imprisonment .
The president had been put on the defensive during two televised debates in which conservative rivals Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , the Tehran mayor , and hardliner Ebrahim Raisi attacked the countryâ€ ™ s economic performance since he made the 2015 nuclear deal with the west , which lifted some sanctions .
But Rouhani , a moderate , hit back with attacks on the hardliners as he sought to reach the estimated 40 % of the 55 million Iranians who do not usually vote .
â€œWe want the law for all institutions , we donâ€ ™ t want institutions exempted from tax .
How come itâ€ ™ s good for people to pay tax , not for you?â€ �
Rouhani said in an apparent reference to Raisi , who is the custodian of the wealthiest charity in the Muslim world , which does not pay tax .
In an extraordinary reference at a rally on Monday to Raisiâ€ ™ s former judicial career , which includes a notorious incident in 1988 when he was one of four judges who oversaw the mass execution of dissidents
, he said : â€œThe people of Iran will announce in this election that they donâ€ ™ t accept those who only knew executions and prison for 38 years.â€ �
At a rally for female supporters in Shiroudi stadium in Tehran on Tuesday he told the crowd that he strongly opposed gender segregation in the society or at universities .
â€œWe wonâ€ ™ t accept gender discrimination , we wonâ€ ™ t accept gender oppression â€ ¦ we want social and political freedom ,
â€ �
he said amid occasional eruptions of chants in support of opposition leaders under house arrest , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , weighed in on Wednesday , urging everyone to preserve the security of the country , saying that â€œanyone who deviates from this path should certainly know that they will be given a slap in the faceâ€ � .
The ayatollah also warned against â€œa
seditionâ€ � , using the same term deployed against the opposition Green movement after the disputed 2009 election .
Sadeq Zibakalam , a professor at Tehran University , said that Rouhaniâ€ ™ s change of tone was retaliation after Ghalibaf and Raisi mounted â€œunethicalâ€ � attacks on him during TV debates .
Rouhani was also reacting to many state - backed groups throwing their weight behind Raisi , Zibakalam said .
â€œThe establishmentâ€ ™ s favourite candidate is Mr Raisi , â€ �
Zibakalam told the Guardian by phone from Tehran .
â€œClergies , state television , Friday imam prayers , basij [ voluntary ] militia and the Revolutionary Guards are all supporting Raisi.â€ �
Zibakalam said it was unlikely that Raisi , who until recently was being touted as a frontrunner to succeed the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader , would drop out in favour of Ghalibaf , the other conservative candidate .
He rejected a theory suggesting Raisi might drop out at the last minute just in time to raise his profile for a possible succession in future , saying : â€œRaisi is running to become president.â€ �
Critics say a defeat would scupper his chances of a possible succession .
â€œRouhani faces a tough race ahead , but in contrast to all the institutions backing Raisi , there exist those who had decided to boycott .
Gradually weâ€ ™ re seeing them coming in support of Rouhani .
A wave of such voters is gradually emerging.â€ � Nasser Hadian , a political expert based in Tehran , said the election mood was heating up .
â€œA bigger participation would make it easier for Rouhani to win , â€ �
he said .
â€œThe president is mainly alluding to those who havenâ€ ™ t made up their mind whether to vote or not.â€ �
Rouhani has attacked the Revolutionary Guards twice in a course of one week .
He accused the elite forces on Friday of attempting to derail the nuclear agreement .
On Tuesday , he attacked them again for criticising him over a mine explosion in northern Iran .
All candidates will take part in a final live TV debate on Friday .
Hadian said Ghalibaf and Raisi both were likely to remain in the race but if Ghalibaf pulled out in favour of Raisi , then Rouhani would benefit because not all Ghalibaf supporters backed a traditional hardliner .
â€œI think if any of those two would step aside , that would be Raisi .
Heâ€
™ ll save his face and his vote could go towards Ghalibaf.â€
�
Ghalibaf and Raisi were busy campaigning this week .
In Tehran , Ghalibaf fans , holding flags emblazoned with â€œ96%â€ � , shouted at a rally : â€œHandsome blond man , you are our presidentâ€ � .
Ghalibaf has been promoting the idea that he stands for the 96 % , saying he opposes the top 4 % wealthiest in the society .
In Kerman , south of Iran , Raisi was also greeted by a packed stadium shouting â€œHeidar , heidarâ€ � â€ “ the Arabic for lion ."
2017-05-14,"Iranian double Oscar - winning film director Asghar Farhadi has endorsed Hassan Rouhani for president , bolstering his campaign before Fridayâ€ ™ s vote .
Farhadi , who won his second Oscar in February for The Salesman , threw his weight behind the moderate incumbent on Sunday , saying in a statement carried by the Isna news agency : â€œI will vote for Dr Rouhani and I hope that those who remain undecided would use their basic right and vote despite all the understandable reasons and conditions that they may have , for the fate of children in our homeland and future generations.â€ � Farhadiâ€ ™ s intervention came as Rouhani , who is allied with the reformists , travelled to Isfahan , Iranâ€ ™ s popular tourist destination , to speak to tens of thousands of supporters in the cityâ€ ™ s historic Naqsh - e Jahan square .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s main two conservative rivals , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf , the Tehran mayor , and hardliner Ebrahim Raisi , were also visiting provincial cities .
Earlier in the day , Rouhaniâ€ ™ s camp received another major boost after the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatamai , issued a video message urging the electorate to â€œonce
againâ€ � make him president .
Khatami , who is facing restrictions in his movements and activities , has a huge influence among the Iranian electorate and his backing was crucial in Rouhaniâ€ ™ s victory in 2013 .
Hardliners , who are seeking a comeback to power , are pulling out all the stops to prevent Rouhani being re - elected .
Both Ghalibaf and Raisi clashed with Rouhani during last Fridayâ€
™ s debate on the national television , exchanging personal jibes .
That fight has now been taken to campaign rallies across the country .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve promised to create 5 million jobs .
Several million families are in absolute poverty , â€ � Ghalibaf said on Sunday in the southern city of Shiraz .
Ghalibaf is leading â€œthe 96 % movementâ€ � , a campaign concept he has developed in opposition to the perceived top 4 % wealthiest in the society .
Raisi , who is also running on a campaign to improve the economy , said in the Golestan province :
â€œCitizenâ€ ™ s right means the right of an unemployed to find job.â€ � Rouhani has been redoubling efforts this week in order to appeal to
â€œgreyâ€ � voters , the estimated 20 million Iranians who do not usually vote .
The president has noticeably sharpened his tone in recent days , portraying his two main rivals as a continuation of politics under his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
â€œHand
in hand we destroyed walls and built bridges , we wonâ€
™ t allow them to destroy bridges and build walls , â€ �
Rouhnai said in Isfahan on Sunday .
His supporters chanted : â€œWe wonâ€ ™ t return to the past.â€ � Rouhani also held a huge rally in Tehranâ€ ™ s Azadi stadium on Saturday packed with supporters of both sexes wearing green and violet wristbands in scenes reminiscent of the Green movement in 2009 .
Among the audience was Parvin Fahimi , the mother of Iranian protester Sohrab Arabi , who was killed in the aftermath of the disputed 2009 presidential vote .
The stadium occasionally erupted in chants in support of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , opposition leaders under house arrest .
Mostafa Tajzadeh , a close ally of Khatami , who served a number of years in jail following the 2009 election , was also at Rouhaniâ€ ™ s rally in Tehran .
A video has emerged of him in a recent gathering , in which he warns that Raisi has bigger ambitions than becoming a president .
Tajzadeh was alluding to speculations that Raisi is being groomed to succeed Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
â€œIn this election , either Rouhani [ will win ] , or if Raisi wins , he wonâ€ ™ t be in office just for four years , he will be there for 40 years , â€ �
he said .
â€œIf we lose this moment , we wonâ€ ™ t forgive ourselves in the future .
We should redouble our efforts.â€ �"
2017-05-15,"Tehranâ€ ™ s mayor has dropped out of Iranâ€ ™ s presidential election , allowing hardliners to a coalesce around a powerful conservative in the fight against the reformist - backed incumbent , Hassan Rouhani .
Mohammad - Baghar Ghalibaf , who has twice before been defeated in presidential elections , issued a statement on Monday saying he was stepping aside to bolster the campaign of hardliner Ebrahim Raisi .
Raisi has been touted as a frontrunner to succeed the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
A presidential win would pave the way for a possible succession , while a defeat could scupper his chances .
â€œWhat is important now and vital is preserving the interests of the people , the country and the revolution and this can not be achieved in any way other than a change in the current situation , â€ � Ghalibaf said , according to the semi - official Fars news agency .
â€œWe should make a fundamental decision to create unity in the revolutionâ€ ™ s front and I call upon all my supporters across the country to come out in support of my esteemed brother Hujjat al - Islam Ebrahim Raisi and make him succeed in forming the government of work and
dignity.â€ �
Ghalibaf took just over 6 m votes in the 2013 presidential election , which was won in the first round by Rouhani with 18.6 m votes and 50.71 % of the vote share .
Under the Iranian system , candidates need an absolute majority of votes to win .
If no candidate wins more than 50 % of the vote in the first round , the top two candidates go to a second - round run - off .
In the absence of credible polling in Iran , it is difficult to gauge Raisiâ€ ™ s popularity across Iran , particularly given that he has not run for presidency before .
Until recently , Raisi , a former prosecutor general of Iran , was a relatively unknown political figure outside the eastern province of Khorasan - Razavi , where he is still the custodian of Astan Quds Razavi , the wealthiest charity in the Muslim world and the organisation in charge of Iranâ€ ™ s holiest shrine , the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad .
Raisi had barely reached adulthood when the 1979 Islamic Revolution took place , but rose quickly through the ranks of Iranâ€ ™ s religious institutions .
In the summer of 1988 , he was one of the four sharia judges who ordered the mass execution of leftists and dissidents .
Raisiâ€ ™ s human rights record has troubled many .
â€œA man who should be on trial for the most heinous crime in contemporary Iranian history , is instead seeking the presidency , â€ � said Hadi Ghaemi , the executive director of the New York - based Center for Human Rights in Iran ( CHRI ) .
â€œAllowing him to run for president is yet another grievous wound for the families who unjustly lost their loved ones in 1988.â€ � Rouhani alluded to this controversy during a campaign rally recently , saying : â€œThe people of Iran will announce in this election that they donâ€ ™ t accept those who only knew executions and prison for 38 years.â€
�
Fridayâ€ ™ s presidential elections are the first since 2015â€ ™ s landmark nuclear agreement , under which Tehran agreed to roll back its nuclear programme in exchange for the removal of sanctions .
The elections are seen in part as a test of Iranâ€ ™ s economic progress under Rouhani since 2015 .
Rouhani has stabilised the Iranian economy and brought down inflation but unemployment is high and his opponents have questioned whether his administration has done enough to bring tangible economic benefits to the country .
He has been pinning his hopes on the estimated 20 million people who are undecided or do not usually vote .
His campaign has been boosted in recent days by endorsements from influential political and cultural figures .
On Sunday , Iranâ€ ™ s double Oscar - winning film director Asghar Farhadi came out in support of Rouhani , who is also being backed by the leader of the countryâ€ ™ s Sunni minority .
Five candidates remain for Fridayâ€ ™ s election , though Rouhaniâ€ ™ s vice - president , Eshaq Jahangiri , is also expected to drop out imminently in favour of his boss ."
2017-05-16,"Four years ago one of the candidates in Iranâ€ ™ s presidential election made himself popular by promising to save Lake Urmia , one of
the worldâ€ ™ s largest saltwater lakes that was on the cusp of disappearing .
Now , President Hassan Rouhani proudly recounts that promise , citing Urmiaâ€ ™ s current state as an environmental success story made possible by prudent decision - making .
Recent intense rainfalls and subsequent floods have come to Rouhaniâ€ ™ s help , earning Urmia a spot on the catalogue of the accomplishments of his administration .
But this is not the full story .
The Islamic Republic is preparing to hold its twelfth presidential election on 19 May.
The outcome will determine the countryâ€ ™ s handling of critical environmental challenges alongside pressing economic and foreign policy affairs and mounting concern about corruption and racketeering .
Modern - day water and environmental management problems continue to bedevil the nation .
Poor air quality and city shutdowns due to recurring massive dust storms are sparking protests in Khuzestan province .
The sand and dust mostly originate in neighbouring countries like Iraq where political instability limits opportunities to address the issue .
Water shortages , diminishing groundwater and wetlands , thinning forests , and desertification are among other persisting challenges .
Remarkably , environmental problems have become a public concern .
They are also recognised at the apex of the Islamic Republicâ€ ™ s power structure , with calls for a national charter to safeguard the environment based on Articles 50 and 110 of the constitution .
Thereâ€ ™ s now a wide awareness of water problems among those running for the countryâ€ ™ s top executive job .
They blame it , for the most part , on past mismanagement , unbridled resource exploitation , and failure to maintain bodies of water .
Candidates are using environmental rhetoric and anticipate receiving questions about the environment , a topic that was rarely discussed during election campaigns just over a decade ago .
The â€œreformistâ€ � candidates tend to bring up environmental issues more in their campaigns , with principalists following suit .
The political dynamics demand the question : has the environment finally found its rightful place in presidential debates ?
Mostafa Hashemitaba , a former minister of industries and vice - president , a â€œreformistâ€ � candidate , who has said he will vote for Rouhani , has been more environmentally attuned , recognising water and environmental problems as one of the main challenges of the country .
He emphasises technological development for efficient agricultural production , and strongly believes in the need to promote tourism and better natural resource management .
Rouhani says things are better now than when he took office , and has released a plan that , on paper , places the environment alongside traditionally important strategic issues like economy , security , and defence .
His four - year plan specifies policies that aim to improve the situation by pursuing bills such as clean air , soil conservation , environmental assessments and wetland conservation .
However , there are contrasting signals about the depth of understanding of environmental problems .
Rouhani and his first vice - president Eshaq Jahangiri boast about self - sufficiency in wheat production without touching on the consequences of this achievement for the countryâ€ ™ s chronically stressed water resources .
Other candidates including Ebrahim Raisi , the custodian and chairman of Astan Quds and a long - time high - ranking member of Iranâ€ ™ s judicial system , Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , the mayor of Tehran , and Mostafa Mirsalim , a former minister of culture and Islamic guidance , have taken positive stances about the need to address the environmental challenges and improve the agricultural sector .
These moves would benefit farmers , whose votes can swing the game in their favour .
They know that the prospect of a higher minimum wage , employment and subsidies are a stronger incentive for disenfranchised populations , and do not hesitate to focus on this token despite the environmental ramifications .
Regardless of who wins the election , the ongoing strain on resources and lack of effective governance will make environmental protection an uphill battle .
Lake Urmia is a long way away from lasting recovery , although progress is being made .
Likewise , efforts are under way to solve dust problems within Iranâ€ ™ s boundaries by restoring the Hoor - al - Azim marsh .
While Iranians have had to pay a high price to learn how poor environmental management can undermine life and the economy , environmental problems are not yet a decisive piece of the puzzle in Iranâ€ ™ s presidential campaigns .
The candidatesâ€ ™ messages weaken when they face the everyday problems of mainstream voters .
Perhaps they simply can not risk losing the support of the undecided voters who will determine the winner of the election .

2017-05-18,"As Tehranâ€ ™ s notorious traffic slowed , the waiting campaigners pounced , pushing posters with the smiling face of Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , through the open windows of trapped cars , pleading for votes and shouting slogans as drivers edged away .
They were determined to make every minute count in the last days of a campaign in which Rouhani began as favourite , but has ended locked in a bitter and close - run fight with a conservative rival .
The short - term stakes of Fridayâ€ ™ s election are high : the future of 2015â€ ™ s landmark nuclear deal and Iranâ€ ™ s cautious rapprochement with the west ; the direction of its economy ; control of its oilfields ; and the freedom given to dissent .
In the long term , the election could decide an even more crucial political battle â€“that for Iranâ€ ™ s next supreme leader .
The successor to ayatollahs Khomeini and Khamanei will be the most powerful person in Iran , and only the third person to lead the Islamic republic since its foundation .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s main opponent in Fridayâ€ ™ s ballot is the conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi .
The 56-year - old , who spent most of his career as a lawyer and judicial official , was a relative unknown when he entered the race , and is considered uncharismatic by even his own supporters .
However , he has consolidated the support of hardliners worried that religious values are under assault , and stirred up populist anger about Iranâ€ ™ s feeble economy .
His slogans echo the anti - establishment sentiment that fuelled Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s rise to the White House .
With slender economic growth , more than one in four young people out of work , and cuts to government subsidies , many people feel abandoned or betrayed .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t want government by the 4%,â€ � Raisi supporters shouted at his most recent Tehran rally , where thousands of devotees packed out a prayer hall and conference centre waving Iranian flags and red roses , his campaign symbol .
Raisi may cast his net wider than Trump in claiming a government â€œby the 4%â€ � , but the anger of his supporters at the inequality in Iran would be familiar to those who covered the US presidentâ€ ™ s campaign , and is the driving force of his popularity .
â€œRouhani canâ€ ™ t provide equality between rich and poor , â€ � said Hajar Pakyari , a biology professor at Islamic Azad University , who was at the Tehran rally with colleagues .
The nuclear deal that was Rouhaniâ€ ™ s headline achievement is still popular across the Iranian political spectrum , but it failed to bring the immediate economic benefits that many expected , and that Rouhaniâ€ ™ s team hoped would carry him to a second term .
That left an opening for Raisi to attack Rouhaniâ€ ™ s subsequent engagement with the west , appealing to conservatives who remain uneasy about Iranâ€ ™ s efforts to court its old enemies .
â€œI personally believe and support ideas that trust the capabilities of the people inside Iran , â€ � said Mohammed - Taghi Ansari - Pur , a professor at the University of Religions and Denominations in the city of Qom .
â€œI believe that we can solve our problems inside Iran .
I do not favour those who depend on outside countries.â€
�
The economy , the fate of the nuclear deal , and questions of reform are significant enough issues to make this an intense election .
But the fact that the next president could hold the key to the ultimate controller of Iran for a generation â€ “ the supreme leader â€ “ ratchets up the pressure .
â€œWe are not voting for the next four years
â€ “ we are voting for the next 40 years , â€ � said one young Rouhani supporter .
While few in Iran are willing to openly discuss who might follow the incumbent , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 78 years old and widely believed to have received treatment for prostate cancer .
Raisi is one of a handful of names talked about as a potential successor .
When he entered the presidential campaign , many thought Raisi merely wanted to raise his public profile for that showdown , and would drop out in the final days to support a fellow conservative , a relatively common tactic in Iran .
Instead , other hardliners dropped out to support him .
This raises the stakes for Raisi and his team , because a loss in this election would badly damage his hopes of becoming supreme leader .
Although democracyâ€ ™ s reach within Iran is limited by the supreme leader and a network of powerful bodies â€ “ such as the Guardian Council , which vets candidates for elections â€ “ popular legitimacy is still extremely important to the leadership .
â€œYou
canâ€
™ t be the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader if you lose a presidential election , â€ � said Foad Izadi , a professor in Tehran Universityâ€ ™ s world studies department .
So the fact that Raisi is still in the race in the final days suggests he and his team believe he can win .
With so much riding on the campaign , it is no surprise that it has become particularly bitter , with Khamenei making a rare intervention on Wednesday to condemn the tone of the personal attacks .
Rouhani responded with bold criticism of Raisi and his backers , and appealed to moderates and reformers alike in an attempt to boost turnout .
Polling puts him ahead , but short of the 50 % needed to avoid a runoff .
His speeches have become more combative , moving from denouncing Raisi for his role in the executions of thousands of political prisoners in the 1980s to attacking powerful bodies like the Revolutionary Guard corps .
On Wednesday he told his hardline opponents they were not equipped to continue his diplomatic efforts .
â€œYou say you want to negotiate with the world , but you donâ€ ™ t know how to speak the global language .
You donâ€ ™ t
even know how to speak the language of your own people , â€ �
Rouhani said at a rally in the northern town of Ardebil .
His outspoken attacks on hardliners and parts of the Iranian state have won him the backing of key members of 2009â€ ™ s Green movement , the reformist uprising after the contested presidential election win of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that was crushed by security forces .
Several leading figures from that campaign â€ “ including the former prime minister Mir - Hussein Mosavi and parliamentary speaker Mehdi Karroubi , who are both under house arrest
â€ “ have endorsed Rouhani ."
2017-05-19,"Soon after 8 am , as voting in Iranâ€ ™ s presidential election got under way , the countryâ€ ™ s 78-year - old supreme leader emerged from behind a set of curtains in his heavily - guarded compound in central Tehran to cast his vote .
As he took the ballot paper , many watching the Ayatollah Ali Khameneiâ€ ™ s moves on television looked straight to the colour of his gemstone ring for clues as to his vote .
Officials were quickly forced to deny that the blueish stone he wore was a coded sign of his support for the reformist - backed incumbent , Hassan Rouhani , whose official campaign colour is violet .
Amid the frenzy of speculation , where Khamenei truly stands in this political battle â€ “ not just for the presidency , but ultimately the future of Iran in the event of his own death â€ “ remains somewhat unclear .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s supporters fear Khameneiâ€ ™ s heart lies with the moderate clericâ€ ™ s challenger , Ebrahim Raisi ,
a hardliner allegedly being groomed by the Revolutionary Guards to one day assume the supreme leadership .
A presidential win would significantly pave the way for that .
Though Khamenei has not publicly spoken out in favour of Raisi , he has attacked Rouhaniâ€ ™ s camp many times in the past two weeks , most notably last week when he criticised Rouhaniâ€ ™ s government for promoting a â€œwestern - influencedâ€ � UN - backed education plan , which he said Iran should not surrender to .
The supreme leaderâ€ ™ s criticisms have , among the Iranian public , bolstered claims spread by Raisiâ€ ™ s camp that the current government under Rouhani promotes homosexuality and masturbation .
Suzanne Maloney , of the Washington research group the Brookings Institute , said the vote was the most important election Iran had faced in many years .
â€œIf we see a Raisi victory
it augurs very seriously for his eventual elevation as Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , a position which he could hold for decades , â€ �
she said .
She added that a Raisi presidency would further complicate Iranâ€ ™ s already strained relations with Washington under Donald Trump , and could jeopardise the nuclear deal secured under Barack Obama .
For Rouhani , the vote is a fight for his political future and Iranâ€ ™ s political trajectory , Maloney said , and could account for his surprisingly sharp rhetoric during the campaign , such as direct attacks on the Revolutionary Guards , the regimeâ€ ™ s elite protection force , and the judicial credentials of Raisi .
â€œI think he seems to be prepared to leave no stone unturned in terms of warning of the possible consequences of an election that is engineered against him , but also trying to rally those who might be sceptical about the utility of their vote to come out and cast a ballot , â€ � she said .
If Rouhani loses , there are fears of a repeat of 2009 , when a disputed election led to months of unrest and bloodshed .
During those elections , Khamenei broke with tradition by explicitly supporting the hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Iranians , Maloney said , had â€œseen this movie beforeâ€ � .
Given prediction of a high turnout , and the fact that four of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s predecessors all served two consecutive terms in office , one would think Rouhani could be fairly confident about the electionâ€ ™ s outcome .
But with such high stakes this round , particularly as the question of the supreme leaderâ€ ™ s succession gets serious , Iranâ€ ™ s political future looks uncertain ."
2017-05-20,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , has won a sweeping endorsement for efforts to end Iranâ€ ™ s international isolation and bring greater freedoms at home , with an unexpected landslide victory in a fiercely contested re - election bid .
His powerful mandate protects the nuclear deal , which has been his landmark achievement to date , and his courting of foreign investment .
It could also have much longer - term implications for Iranâ€ ™ s future , by giving reformists a greater influence over the looming battle to choose a new supreme leader .
Polling stations were forced to stay open until midnight in parts of the country because so many Iranians wanted to vote , defying fears of voter apathy .
Rouhani claimed 23.5 million votes , while his rival Ebrahim Raisi trailed on 15.8 million , after nearly three - quarters of the electorate cast their votes , the interior ministry said .
In a victory speech to the nation on live TV , Rouhani promised to rule for all Iranians .
But while celebrating his huge mandate in the election , which he labelled the â€œmost competitive everâ€ � , he also described his opponents as dangerously backward - looking .
â€œYesterday , you said no to those who wanted us to return to the past , â€ � he told the nation .
The scale of his victory provides a strong platform to challenge hardliners who still hold ultimate control in a Iranâ€ ™ s unwieldy hybrid of theocracy and democracy .
And in a signal that he planned to turn an outspoken campaign into a combative second term , Rouhani also thanked reformist figurehead Mohammad Khatami , his most important ally and backer .
Security forces have banned any mention of the hugely popular former presidentâ€ ™ s name in the media , meaning Rouhani crossed a red line just hours into his new term .
â€œMillions and millions of people are happy because Rouhani won , â€ � said businessman Ahad Esmaili , 31 , one of a crowd breaking into dance at a spontaneous celebration in the heart of Tehranâ€ ™ s crowded bazaar , when the final figures were announced .
The election was a tense showdown between Rouhani and hardliner Raisi , both senior clerics but with little else in common .
The challenger consolidated conservative support behind his initially lacklustre bid for power , by mounting a campaign that mixed economic populism with religious conservatism and an isolationist foreign policy .
Raisiâ€ ™ s last - minute surge may have unwittingly helped Rouhani , as moderates spooked by the prospect of slipping back into international isolation and stricter controls at home raced to the polls .
â€œIâ€ ™ m even happier than I was four years ago when he won the first time
, â€ � said tailor Mariam Farmayeshi , 34 .
â€œMy husband voted for the first time in 20 years , because he thought it was necessary to keep out Raisi.â€ �
Watch salesman Yousef Khaleghi said he spent the entire day driving dozens of friends and relatives to the polls .
He had gone bankrupt during the government of Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and was determined to do everything he could to prevent another hardliner coming to power .
â€œI love Mr Rouhani
, â€ � he said with a grin , before adding he was grateful to Iranian women for their part in the re - election success .
â€œWe should acknowledge that Iranian women did a lot for him to win .
At each polling station ( in areas that supported Rouhani ) they made up more than half of the voters waiting in line , â€ � he added .
In an apparent nod to that vital support base , Rouhani thanked voters on Instagram with a picture that is likely to particularly outrage conservatives smarting from their loss .
It shows a family group celebrating their vote , with three of the younger women wearing colourful clothes and headscarves set back so far on their heads that they are barely visible .
â€œGreat people of Iran , you are the true winners of this election , â€ � he wrote underneath .
Many of the women who turned up to vote for Rouhani felt their personal freedoms were under threat from Raisi , whose supporters frequently accused the president of abandoning Islamic values .
Many were particularly exercised about womenâ€ ™ s dress , at one rally even handing out suggestions about covering up to women who they deemed not appropriately clothed .
â€œI felt much better with Rouhani , more secure and freer .
If his rival had come to power there would have been more restrictions on women , â€ � said Tehran housewife Pantea Mehrabadi , 46 .
â€œI voted for him first because I wanted to support him , but also to combat Raisi.â€
�
But victory also comes with a heavy weight of expectations that Rouhani may find it hard to fulfil , given the constraints of Iranâ€ ™ s complex government system and the weight of a US sanctions regime that Washington is in no hurry to lift .
The end of nuclear sanctions that followed his landmark deal was not followed by the hoped - for flood of foreign investment because unilateral US sanctions stayed in place , making doing business in Iran complicated or illegal .
For Rouhani to meet the expectations generated by his victory he will need western governments to push for those sanctions to be rolled back , or to step up investment in the areas they allow .
Although victory has tilted the political balance towards reformists in the short term , Raisi secured a face - saving vote tally high enough to mean that he is not finished politically , and lying ahead is the contest over who will be the new supreme leader .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei holds the position for life , but he is 77 and thought to be in poor health .
A hardliner keen to preserve his legacy , he is believed to have tacitly backed Raisi as president , and possibly favoured him as a possible successor .
After the vote he issued a statement addressed to the Iranian people in which he praised the â€œmassive and epicâ€ � turnout .
However in contrast to the 2013 elections , he offered no congratulations to Rouhani .
While Raisi lost the election , he won enough support to preserve his political career .
His 16 million votes , combined with success in persuading hardliners to back him , could put him in a good position to run in 2021 when Rouhani will be barred from seeking another term in office .
â€œMr
Rouhani should not forget that more than 16 million people did not vote for him , â€ � Reza Gholami , a cleric allied with the hardliners , was quoted as saying by the semi - official Fars news agency .
â€œSo he should respect their right to criticise him.â€ �"
2017-05-27,"As President Donald Trump rocked from foot to foot at the edge of a sedate , highly choreographed sword ceremony in Riyadh last week , 800 miles away , thousands of young people were streaming into the streets of Tehran for a wild , spontaneous dance of celebration .
The Iranians were mostly marking reformist President Hassan Rouhaniâ€ ™ s landslide victory in his re - election bid , a sweeping endorsement of his policy of ending international isolation while rolling out greater freedoms at home .
They were also marking a win for democracy in a region where the right to a meaningful vote is in all too short supply .
Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader and powerful unelected bodies had left little doubt that they favoured his opponent , but Rouhani won anyway .
Saudi Arabia is one of many countries in the Middle East that keeps its few periodic gestures towards democracy as closely choreographed as its welcoming ceremonies .
The electorate is no more likely than the sword dancers to wrest power from its autocratic leaders .
Yet the next day , when Trump took to the stage in Riyadh for a speech touted as a landmark policy address , he had nothing but menace for Iran , effectively lining up behind critics who dismiss its votes as sham propaganda shows .
It was at best disingenuous , at worst an attempt to mislead , by misrepresenting Iranâ€ ™ s complicated and bizarre hybrid of democracy and theocracy .
It is true that the president is not the ultimate ruler , a position held by supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appointed for life and the unelected bodies that answer to him , such as the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the judiciary , wield immense power .
But the president can exert a powerful influence on the economy , international relations and internal norms .
Anyone who disputes the significance of the elections should consider the difference between the Iran governed by Holocaust - denying hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad between 2005 and 2013 and Iran under Rouhani .
â€œDismissing the ballots of 41 million Iranians as irrelevant or fake â€ “ as the Trump administration and some of its supporters were quick to do â€ “ represents a dangerous miscalculation in a region that can ill afford more American delusions , â€ � said Suzanne Maloney , analyst with the Brookings Institution .
â€œMultibillion dollar arms sales and gilded conclaves of octogenarian autocrats will not beget the â€˜better futureâ€ ™ that Trumpâ€ ™ s Riyadh speech rightly challenged the region to build.â€
�
The joy on the streets of Tehran , where police stood by as young people broke rules on the mixing of genders , was mostly driven by that hope , in a country where unemployment and inflation are still rampant .
Although Rouhaniâ€ ™ s landmark nuclear deal was welcomed by Iranians tired of isolation , it has yet to unleash the hoped - for economic benefits .
Unilateral US sanctions remained in place even after international bans were lifted .
The economy was at the heart of the campaign and perhaps Rouhaniâ€ ™ s weakest point ; he will be under greater pressure to deliver growth .
He will need foreign investment and further engagement from governments willing to ignore Trumpâ€ ™ s message .
If western nations that worked so hard with Rouhani to craft the nuclear deal want to see Iranâ€ ™ s reformers prosper , they should think what they will have to offer the electorate when it returns to the polls in four yearsâ€ ™ time ."
2017-06-22,"Tensions are mounting between Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader and the countryâ€ ™ s president after the latterâ€ ™ s landslide victory in last monthâ€ ™ s election .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , 78 , has sharpened his criticism of the reformist president , Hassan Rouhani , including humiliating him in a meeting of the countryâ€ ™ s most senior officials .
A hardliner keen to preserve his legacy , Khamenei is believed to have tacitly backed Ebrahim Raisi , Rouhaniâ€ ™ s rival , in the election .
The president , who increased his mandate by 5 m votes when he won his second term , fired back this week by saying that the political legitimacy of a religious leader is determined by the â€œpeopleâ€ ™ s will and invitationâ€ � â€ “ comments that supporters of Khamenei , whose position as supreme leader is a lifelong appointment , have received with disdain .
Clerics sympathetic to Khamenei argue that the legitimacy of the leader , or the rule of the Islamic jurist ( Velayat - e - Faghih ) is divine .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s comments come after Khamenei delivered a withering speech last week to an audience of senior officials including Rouhani , the judiciary chief and the parliamentary speaker .
â€œMr
President has talked at great lengths about the countryâ€ ™ s economy and well , heâ€ ™ s said â€˜this should be doneâ€ ™ , â€˜that should be doneâ€ ™ ,â€ �
Khamenei said .
â€œBut who is he addressing by mentioning the â€˜should dosâ€ ™ ?â€
�
the ayatollah asked , before responding : â€œHimself.â€ � A video circulating online of that moment shows the audience bursting into laughter while Rouhani smiles uncomfortably .
Khamenei continued : â€œIn 1980 - 1981 the then president polarised society in two camps , and divided the country into opponents and supporters ; this should not be repeated.â€
�
The ayatollah was referring to the first post - revolutionary president , Abolhassan Banisadr , who was impeached and later exiled after clashing with the clerical establishment .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s supporters view the leaderâ€ ™ s comments as a warning that he may face a similar fate .
Ali Ansari , director of the Institute of Iranian Studies at St Andrews University , said Khamenei was attempting to curb Rouhaniâ€ ™ s rising popularity after his election success .
â€œAfter the elections Khamenei was unhappy with the results and theyâ€ ™ re trying to contain it , â€ � Ansari said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s all standard stuff that we heard in 2000 , 2001 when they got a bit panicky and worried about what [ former reformist president Mohammad ]
Khatami would try and do .
They want to send a message to Rouhani to get back into your box.â€ �
He added : â€œHeâ€ ™ s interestingly saying , Iâ€ ™ m not.â€
�
The power struggle has also seen Rouhani forced to defend his success at the ballot box .
Addressing a group of university professors , he referred to Ali ibn Abi Talib , the prophet Muhammadâ€ ™ s son - in - law , a revered Shia figure also respected by Sunnis , who became a caliph only when people showed him support .
â€œWe are not following western beliefs when weâ€ ™ re holding elections and going after peopleâ€ ™ s votes , â€ � he said , insisting that democracy was not a western gift .
â€œWe belong to a religion in which [ Imam Ali ] based his leadership on peopleâ€ ™ s will and peopleâ€ ™ s
vote.â€
�
Khamenei , in particular , bought into the anti - Rouhani spin during the campaign period that said his administration was promoting western lifestyle choices and homosexuality in schools â€ “ false claims that infuriated Rouhani .
Rouhaniâ€ ™
s predecessors have also found that their relations with Khamenei became more strained in their second term in office , as they jostled to leave their own legacy and test the limits of power under the Iranian constitution and Khameneiâ€ ™ s supreme authority .
Even hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who was blocked from running in this yearâ€ ™ s election , fell foul of Khamenei during his second term in office .
Referring to the previous administrations of Mohammad Khatami and his predecessor , Hashemi Rafsanjani , Ansari said : â€œBoth of them were probably more diplomatic than Rouhani was , but they basically said the same thing.â€ �
However , the power struggle between the elected faction and the unelected faction of the Iranian establishment has become even more complicated under Rouhani tenure because of uncertainty over Khameneiâ€ ™ s succession .
There is also uncertainty surrounding Khameneiâ€ ™ s state of health after his prostate surgery in 2014 .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s interesting is that Khamenei has been so blunt in his criticism , heâ€
™ s been very personal â€ “ that meeting where he actually specifically named Rouhani and said get on with your job and stop criticising other people , and everyone laughed about it , â€ � said Ansari .
â€œBasically , Khamenei has given the green light to hardliners to start containing him , but we have to wait and see how it pans out .
Obviously theyâ€ ™ re trying to hit him
[ Rouhani ] very hard , and we just have to see how Rouhani responds.â€ �"
2017-06-23,"Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has been heckled during an annual pro - Palestinian rally in Tehran , a week after he was criticised by the supreme leader , as a power struggle between the two appeared to escalate .
Rouhani , who was participating in the Quds rally , which is held on the last Friday of Ramadan , had to be rushed to his car after protesters shouted slogans comparing him to Abolhassan Banisadr , the countryâ€ ™ s first president who was impeached and later exiled after falling foul of the clerical establishment .
â€œRouhani , Banisadr , happy marriage , â€ � protesters chanted .
There were also shouts of â€œDeath to liar , death to American mullahâ€ � .
This month , Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , humiliated Rouhani in public , saying he should not polarise the society in the same way â€ “ in Khameneiâ€
™ s
opinion â€ “ that Banisadr did .
â€œIn 1980 - 81 the then president polarised society in two camps , and divided the country into opponents and supporters ; this should not be repeated , â€ � the 78-year - old ayatollah said last week , prompting retaliatory remarks by Rouhani .
The heckling at Fridayâ€ ™ s rally indicates Khamenei has given his hardline supporters carte blanche to attack the president , who increased his mandate by 5 m votes with a landslide victory in last monthâ€ ™ s election .
The issue at the heart of the power struggle is â€œwhether the civil society has a role and right to govern or notâ€ � , Banisadr told the Guardian on Friday , adding that this was the main difference between totalitarianism and democracy .
â€œFrom
when velayat - e - faghih [ the rule by the Islamic jurist ] was put in place , they were concerned about the connection of the countryâ€ ™ s second most powerful person [ president ] and the civil society , â€ � the 84-year - old said from exile in France .
â€œThey want to cut this link no matter what .
During my time , they closed down universities and carried out executions to undercut the civil society and make it passive .
Now Mr Khamenei is worried , particularly if he dies , because Mr Rouhani is saying that his successor should obtain peopleâ€ ™ s
vote.â€
�
Banisadr said a similar undercutting was taking place now .
Khameneiâ€ ™
s
recent use of the phrase atash - be - ekhtiar ( free to shoot ) has been interpreted by some observers as giving a green light to hardline supporters to interfere in domestic politics .
â€œMr
Khamenei has signalled that he would tolerate Rouhani if the president decided to keep a low profile , otherwise heâ€ ™ ll face the fate of Banisadr , my fate .
The warning is serious , â€ � the former president said .
Rouhani has remained defiant in the face of pressure .
On Thursday , he implied that the powerful Revolutionary Guards , which are controlled by Khamenei , act as a parallel government , albeit one equipped with arms and access to media .
â€œPresidency is to be connected to the people , â€ � Banisadr said , referring to the fact that people directly vote for the president , while â€œthe supreme leaderâ€ ™ s function is exactly the oppositeâ€ � , referring to his presumed divine powers .
â€œBy nature , they wonâ€ ™ t get along.â€ �"
2017-06-30,"The modified version of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s travel ban , which went into effect Thursday night , is a â€œshamefulâ€ � act targeting â€œIranian grandmothersâ€
� ,
Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister has said .
Nationals from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen have been banned from obtaining a visa to enter the US if they fail to show a credible â€œbona fide relationshipâ€
� with a person or entity in the US .
Mohammad Javad Zarif , a close ally of Iranâ€ ™ s moderate president , Hassan Rouhani , said on Twitter : â€œUS now bans Iranian grandmothers from seeing their grandchildren , in a truly shameful exhibition of blind hostility to all Iranians.â€ � Iranians protested by sharing photos of their grandparents online using # GrandparentsNotTerrorists .
â€œThis is my lovely grandma .
@realDonaldTrump
does she look like a terrorist to you ?
# GrandparentsNotTerrorists , â€ �
tweeted Elham Khatami , who works for the National Iranian American Council ( NIAC ) .
â€œBecause
Trump doesnâ€
™ t think I have a bonafide relationship with my grandpa ...
# GrandparentsNotTerrorists , â€ � tweeted another Iranian American , Ida Adibi , along with an image of her grandfather kissing her .
NIACâ€ ™ s legal counsel , Shayan Modarres , said in a statement : â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s pathological pursuit of the Muslim Ban has reached a new low by targeting grandparents of American children.â€
�
â€œThere are one million Iranian Americans in the United States and many can not return home to visit loved ones , â€ � he said .
â€œPresident Trumpâ€ ™ s directive might as well pull children out of the arms of their grandparents who will no longer be able to visit for the sole reason that they are Iranian .
The president is supposed to protect American families , not rip them apart.â€ �
He said the â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ � and â€œinhumaneâ€ �
policy â€œdoes nothing to add to Americaâ€ ™ s securityâ€ � , and â€œonly creates divisions by turning some Americans into second - class citizens simply because of their ancestryâ€ � .
The International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) has warned that the restrictive measures will have an immediate impact on already vetted refugees scheduled to go to the US .
That includes an Iranian refugee currently in Iraqi Kurdistan , waiting to be admitted by the US .
After five years waiting , he was assigned for resettlement in the US 18 months ago after being recognised as in genuine need of protection .
He said he underwent two interviews with American authorities a year ago , completed his medical examinations and was almost â€œone step awayâ€
� from traveling to the US .
â€œUnfortunately , this order changed the whole thing , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œThe most distressing part is the three - month suspension of accepting refugees .
This period could have been finished months ago ; however , people like me should wait again for these three months to pass in order to be hopeful again .
â€œSadly , no one talk that much about the effects of this order on refugees , â€ � he said .
â€œNo other countries accept Iranians and we can do nothing but remain hopeful and
optimistic.â€ � Cornell University law school professor Stephen Yale - Loehr said the state department instructions interpreted the supreme courtâ€ ™ s order too narrowly .
â€œOver half of all refugees donâ€ ™ t have close family ties in the US .
Under these instructions , the â€˜lost boysâ€ ™ of Sudan â€ “ orphan children who fled famine and war and who came to the United States as refugees several years ago â€ “ would not be allowed to enter now ,
â€ � he said .
Extreme vetting already in place means Syrian refugees wait an average of 18 - 24 months before being admitted to the US , he said .
â€œThe 21-step screening process goes through multiple agencies , including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the US State Department , the FBI and the US.â€ �
He added : â€œThe Cato Institute calculates that the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is about one in 3.6 billion a year .
The head of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services told Congress last September that not a single act of actual terrorist violence has been committed by a refugee â€˜who has undergone our screening proceduresâ€ ™ since 9/11.â€ � Negar Mortazavi , a Washington DC - based Iranian - American journalist , said the â€œIranian community have been disproportionately affected by the travel banâ€ � .
Hamidreza Ranjbar is an Iranian blogger who has been an asylum seeker in Turkey for more than four years .
â€œFor a lot of us , this is the final blow , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œThis travel ban sets fire to a quilt to get rid of a moth.â€ � Ahmad Sadri , an Iranian American professor of sociology and anthropology at Lake Forest College , said : â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t matter that none of these countries have been involved in international terrorism for decades .
It doesnâ€
™ t matter that a country such as Saudi Arabia that fomented the Islamist ideology for terrorism and spread it from Nigeria to Indonesia is not included in this ban .
At the end of the day , it doesnâ€ ™ t matter that this ban does nothing to promote the security of Americans one iota.â€ �"
2017-07-16,"Iranâ€ ™ s state - run newspapers on Sunday broke with the countryâ€ ™ s strict rules on female dress to show the mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani with her head uncovered , as the country mourned the death at the age of 40 of the woman known as the queen of mathematics .
Tributes were led by the president , Hassan Rouhani , who posted a recent picture of Mirzakhani on Instagram without a hijab .
â€œThe grievous passing of Maryam Mirzakhani , the eminent Iranian and world - renowned mathematician , is very much heartrending , â€ � he wrote .
Mirzakhani , a Stanford University professor , died in hospital in California on Saturday after cancer in her breast spread to her bone marrow .
The university president , Marc Tessier - Lavigne , said Mirzakhaniâ€ ™ s influence would live on in the â€œthousands of women
she inspiredâ€ � to pursue maths and science .
When in 2014 she became the first woman to win the Fields medal , often described as mathsâ€ ™ Nobel prize , Iranian newspapers digitally retouched Mirzakhaniâ€ ™ s photograph to put a scarf over her head while others published a sketch showing only her face .
Iranâ€ ™ s
strict laws on female dress require all women to be covered in public .
The front page of Hamshahri , a state newspaper , particularly stood out , winning praise for portraying her as she had lived .
â€œMaths genius yielded to algebra of deathâ€ � , read its headline over a picture of Mirzakhani without a hijab .
â€œThe queen of mathematicsâ€ ™
eternal departureâ€ � , read the headline of Donya - e - Eqtesadâ€ ™ s headline .
The Fields medal , first given in 1936 , is awarded to exceptional talents under the age of 40 once every four years .
Mirzakhani won the prize in 2014 for her â€œoutstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spacesâ€ � .
Christiane Rousseau , vice - president of the International Mathematics Union , said at the time it was â€œan extraordinary momentâ€ � and compared it to Marie Curieâ€ ™ s Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry at the beginning of the 20th century .
In another sign that Mirzakhani was breaking more taboos even after her death , a group of parliamentarians in Iran on Sunday urged the speeding up of an amendment to a law that would allow children of Iranian mothers married to foreigners to be given Iranian nationality .
Mirzakhani is survived by her Czech scientist husband and her daughter but a marriage between an Iranian woman and a non - Muslim man was previously not recognised , complicating visits to Iran by their children .
Fars news agency reported on Sunday that 60 MPs were pressing for the amendments so that Mirzakhaniâ€ ™ s daughter could visit Iran .
Mirzakhani was born and raised in Iran .
She studied at Tehranâ€ ™ s prestigious Sharif university and later finished a PhD at Harvard in 2004 .
She had survived a bus crash in February 1998 when a vehicle carrying the mathematical elite of Tehranâ€ ™ s Sharif University back from a competition in the western city of Ahwaz skidded out of control and crashed into a ravine .
Seven award - winning mathematicians and two drivers lost their lives in the crash .
Mirzakhani and at least two other survivors later left their country , underlying Iranâ€ ™ s long - standing brain drain difficulties .
â€œA light was turned off today , it breaks my heart â€
¦
Gone far too soon , â€ � said Firouz Naderi , an Iranian Nasa scientist .
â€œA genius ?
Yes .
But also a daughter , a mother and a wife.â€ �
Tessier - Lavigne , the Stanford president , described Mirzakhanai as â€œa brilliant mathematical theorist , and also a humble person who accepted honours only with the hope that it might encourage others to follow her path.â€ � Edward Frenkel , University of California Berkeley professor and the author of the New York Times bestseller Love and Math , tweeted :
â€œRIP # MaryamMirzakhani â€ “ a great mathematician and wonderful human being who broke a glass ceiling and inspired many ,
men and women alike.â€ � Mirzakhani predominantly worked on geometric structures on surfaces and their deformations .
A statement from Stanford said she â€œspecialised in theoretical mathematics that read like a foreign language by those outside of mathematics : moduli spaces , TeichmÃ¼ller theory , hyperbolic geometry , Ergodic theory and symplectic geometry.â€ �
In a rare 2008 interview , with the Clay Mathematics Institute , Mirzakhani said as a child she dreamt of becoming a writer and did poorly at maths at school .
â€œI
never thought I would pursue mathematics until my last year in high school , â€ �
she said , crediting her older brother for getting her interested in maths and science .
â€œMy older brother was the person who got me interested in science in general .
He used to tell me what he learned in school .
My first memory of mathematics is probably the time that he told me about the problem of adding numbers from 1 to 100.â€ � ( The answer is 5,050 and the trick is to look at pairs that add up to 101 . )"
2017-07-16,"The brother of Iranâ€ ™ s moderate president , Hassan Rouhani , has been arrested amid escalating tensions between the government and the countryâ€ ™ s hardline judiciary ahead of his swearing - in ceremony next month .
Hossein Fereidoun , a top presidential aide who played a senior role in more than two years of high - level negotiations between Iran and the west over Tehranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme , was taken to prison after failing to secure bail on Saturday , local agencies reported .
The exact reasons behind Fereidounâ€ ™ s arrest are unclear but it was reported that it was on charges connected to financial crimes .
Gholam - Hossein Mohseni - Ejeâ€ ™
i , the spokesman for the Iranian judiciary , confirmed the news on Sunday during a weekly press briefing in Tehran .
â€œA bail order was issued for him yesterday and because he did not secure the bail , he was taken to jail .
If he does so , he will be released on bail , â€ � he said ,
according to quotes carried by the semi - official Iranian Studentsâ€ ™ News Agency .
Mohseni - Ejeâ€ ™ i also announced an American dual national had been sentenced to 10 years in prison .
He did not name the individual but said the accused was an â€œinfiltrating agentâ€ � , terminology used to describe those collaborating with foreign governments .
Mizan Online , a news agency affiliated to the Iranian judiciary , later identified him as Xiyue Wang , a Chinese - born American professor at Princeton University .
Rouhaniâ€ ™
s supporters have seen his brotherâ€ ™ s arrest as part of efforts to undermine him during his second term in office .
Fereidounâ€ ™ s detention comes a few weeks ahead of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s swearing - in ceremony following his landslide victory in Mayâ€ ™ s presidential election , complicating an already tense atmosphere between him and hardliners .
The reformist - backed Rouhani increased his mandate by 5 million votes in an election that dealt a blow to conservatives .
A widening rift has since opened at the highest level of the Islamic republic between the president and the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The dispute concerns who has the ultimate power in Iran , particularly over the judiciary and the armed forces .
Rouhani has recently sharpened his rhetoric over the conduct of the judiciary , saying recently that some arrests were arbitrary .
Iranian presidents are generally weakened in their second term and Rouhaniâ€ ™ s predecessors have all fallen out with Khamenei at some point during their second term as they jostled to leave their own legacy and test their limits of power under Iranian constitution vis - a - vis Khameneiâ€ ™ s supreme authority .
Former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was blocking from running in Mayâ€ ™ s election and his top aide was recently rearrested .
Rouhani was heckled in June during an annual pro - Palestinian rally in Tehran , with protesters allied with the hardliners shouting slogans comparing him to Abolhassan Banisadr , the countryâ€ ™ s first president who was impeached and later exiled after falling foul of the clerical establishment .
Local news agencies , even the countryâ€ ™ s state - run English - language Press TV , widely covered Fereidounâ€ ™ s arrest in a sign that demonstrated hardliners were prepared for a showdown .
Fereidoun came in high - level contact with American officials during the nuclear talks .
In March 2015 , at the height of intense negotiations , when the news broke that the presidentâ€ ™ s mother had died , the then US secretary of state , John Kerry , went to Fereidounâ€ ™ s room to personally express his condolences .
Pictures of that meeting circulated online as a rare sign of an American official sympathising with a senior Iranian .
Prior to Rouhaniâ€ ™ s first victory in 2013 , Fereidoun was a veteran diplomat and had served as Iranâ€ ™ s ambassador to Malaysia for eight years and later as a senior diplomat at Iranâ€ ™ s delegation to the UN .
The difference between the two brothersâ€ ™ surnames is due to the fact that the president changed his family name to Rouhani as a security measure to avoid the attention of the Savak secret police when preaching against the shah before the 1979 Iranian revolution .
Rouhani means cleric in Farsi ."
2017-08-02,"Iranâ€ ™ s president is under pressure to appoint female ministers as he mulls a cabinet reshuffle before his swearing - in ceremony on Sunday .
Hassan Rouhaniâ€ ™ s all - male list of ministers during his first term in office
dismayed his base even though the moderate cleric appointed a number of women as vice - president , a comparatively less senior position in Iranâ€ ™ s political hierarchy .
As jockeying intensifies before the unveiling of his new cabinet , concerns have grown that Rouhani may give in to pressure from hardliners and not include women as ministers .
Expectation is particularly high because he ran on a reformist agenda .
Under the Iranian constitution , the Majlis ( parliament ) , would have to approve his appointees .
Tehran is preparing for a big inauguration ceremony after Rouhaniâ€ ™ s landslide victory in May.
Officials have declared Sunday a bank holiday as eight presidents and senior diplomatic delegations gather in the Iranian capital to mark the beginning of his second term in office .
In a sign of thawing relations , the UK is for the first time sending a minister of state , Alistair Burt , who is in charge of the Middle East and North Africa at the Foreign Office .
Despite shortcomings , one existing Rouhani appointee â€ “ his vice - president for women and family affairs , Shahindokht Molaverdi â€ “ has won the support of some of the countryâ€ ™ s most respected womenâ€ ™ s rights campaigners .
Her hands have largely been tied in the past four years as she came under huge pressure from hardliners , who threatened her with prosecution .
Molaverdi said in April that as many as three women would be appointed as ministers but she has sounded pessimistic more recently and it is not clear if she would keep her job .
Mohammad Bagher Nobakht , the Rouhani
administrationâ€ ™ s
spokesman , said on Tuesday , that â€œthe number of women in the cabinet would not go downâ€ � , the semi - official Isna news agency reported , but he sent mixed signals over ministerial appointments , suggesting there may not be any women as ministers at all .
â€œIf there would be no women ministers in the cabinet , that does not mean weâ€ ™ re not using the potential of women [ in the government],â€
� he said .
â€œWomen will still play a significant role .
Itâ€ ™ s an injustice to women to think that they should only be used to fill ministerial roles.â€
�
The taboo of appointing female ministers after the 1979 Islamic revolution has in fact already been broken .
In 2009 , former hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad nominated three women as ministers amid opposition from conservative MPs and some senior clerics .
One of his appointees , Marzieh Vahid - Dastjerdi , was approved and she became the countryâ€ ™ s first post - revolutionary female minister , serving as minister of health and medical education .
Ghoncheh Ghavami , a leading womenâ€ ™ s rights activist based in Tehran , said â€œit is much more important to have gender - sensitive and feminist policies than just merely relying on descriptive representationâ€ �
but nevertheless having female ministers is still important because â€œIranâ€ ™ s political system is too male - orientedâ€ � .
She said : â€œThis structure has eliminated women on the excuse of meritocracy and experience but it looks like that main criteria for them is being male .
Thatâ€ ™ s why appointing female ministers is symbolically important and would send a powerful signal in a country where politics still originates from men.â€ �
Ghavami said Dastjerdiâ€ ™ s appointment meant Rouhani had run out of excuses , especially now he was facing a friendlier parliament .
She said even a conservative figure such as Dastjerdi performed better than her male colleagues and was removed before too long after a spat with Ahmadinejad .
â€œConservatives , however , still have traditional views about women , their priority is for women to stay at home and take care of their kids .
Even their female parliamentarians held such a world view and were pursuing policies that were discriminatory towards women , â€ � she said .
Womenâ€ ™ s
rights campaigner Fatemeh Sadeghi is among six speakers invited to a discussion panel in Tehran this week called Breaking the Glass Ceiling , in reference to Iranian women in senior managerial roles .
She believes symbolic appointment of women as ministers will not resolve challenges faced by women in Iran .
â€œThe presence of one or two women in the cabinet wonâ€
™ t much advance womenâ€ ™ s rights and the experience of Mrs Mowlaverdi shows that until we pursue gender [ equality ] policies , we wonâ€ ™ t see a massive change or transformation for women , â€ � she said ."
2017-08-06,"Hassan Rouhani has been sworn in for a second term in office in a Tehran ceremony over the weekend that highlighted European support for the nuclear deal with the west despite Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s threats to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement .
Rouhani , who was re - elected in a landslide victory in May , took an oath before parliamentarians and foreign dignitaries , including the EU foreign policy chief , Federica Mogherini , and senior diplomats from the UK , France and Germany .
The president said in his speech , which was aired live on the national television , that â€œIran would not be the first to pull out of the nuclear deal , but it will not remain silent about the US repeated violations of the accordâ€ � .
Despite his belligerent rhetoric , Trump has twice reluctantly certified Iranâ€ ™ s compliance with the deal , allowing the nuclear - related sanctions to remain suspended , but it has emerged that he has instructed aides to find a way to declare Tehran in violation of the agreement .
â€œToday is the time for the mother of all negotiations , not the mother of all bombs , â€ �
Rouhani said , referring to the US dropping its largest non - nuclear bomb ever used in combat in Afghanistan in April .
The Afghan president , Ashraf Ghani , was among those present at Rouhaniâ€ ™ s inauguration .
â€œThe US has showed a lack of commitment in its implementation of the nuclear deal because its policymakers are addicted to the illegal and futile policy of sanctions and humiliation , â€ �
Rouhani said .
â€œThis has proved the US to be an unreliable partner to the world and even to its longtime allies.â€ �
Referring to Trump , he added : â€œWe do not wish to engage with political novices ...
Those who want to tear up the nuclear deal should know that they will be ripping up their own political life by doing so and the world wonâ€ ™ t forget their noncompliance.â€ �
The International Atomic Energy Agency has said in its latest report that Iran was complying with the terms of the agreement , but Tehran has complained the US is reneging on its obligations .
Iranâ€ ™ s parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , said last week that Tehran had formally complained to the joint commission supervising implementation of the accord over the US senateâ€ ™ s new sanctions against Iranian entities , imposed over Tehranâ€ ™ s testing of missiles .
Mogherini â€œreiterated the EUâ€ ™ s unwavering commitment to the deal , recalling its historic significance , multilateral dimension and its importance for regional and global stabilityâ€ � , an official statement said .
Local media quoted Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iranâ€ ™ s foreign minister , as telling Mogherini : â€œMr Trump is trying to destroy the nuclear accord at Iranâ€ ™ s expense , and Europe should be conscious of this.â€ � Sadegh Zibakalam , a Tehran University professor , said the inauguration sent a powerful message to Trump .
â€œThe fact that Ms Mogherini as the representative of the EU foreign policy was here showed that the EU values the nuclear deal greatly , â€ � he said .
â€œInternationally , Iran has had a win and a loss , â€ �
he said .
â€œOur loss is that Obama is gone and the Democrats have been replaced by the Republicans .
The win is that Iran has been successful in strengthening its relations with Europe .
The main reason Trump has not been able to dismantle the agreement is that the EU is resisting and the US knows very well that the EU is serious in keeping the nuclear deal.â€ �
In a sign of thawing relations with Europe , Mogherini was popular in Iran .
A group of Iranian parliamentarians came under attack domestically after an image circulated online showing them jostling to take a selfie with her .
One MP , Farajollah Najafi , apologised after largely negative reactions online .
Many Iranian social media users said the MPsâ€ ™ behaviour was embarrassing and demeaning and in sharp contrast to womenâ€ ™ s rights in Iran .
Rouhani has been under pressure in recent weeks to nominate female ministers as he considers a cabinet reshuffle .
In 2013 , he unveiled his cabinet on the day he was inaugurated , but he has yet to name his new ministers .
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s inauguration dominated front pages in Tehran .
â€œInauguration with an anti - Trump flavourâ€
� read the headline of Iranian daily Khorasan .
â€œRouhani , the 12th tenant of Pastorâ€ � read Kelidâ€ ™ s front page , referring to Rouhani as being the 12th president after the 1979 revolution to occupy the presidential palace in Pastor Street , Tehran .
The ultra - conservative newspaper Keyhan was critical of Rouhaniâ€ ™ s speech , saying in a headline : â€œUnveiling the mother of negotiations instead of confronting the mother of sanctions.â€ �
Rouhaniâ€ ™ s inauguration came two days after his re - election was formally endorsed by the countryâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who urged the president on Thursday to conduct â€œextensive interaction with the worldâ€ � .
Nasser Hadian , a political expert based in Tehran , said the ceremony showed that the world was recognising Iran .
â€œThe world understands that , in spite of differences , there is a mechanism inside Iran through the ballot box that helps resolve big issues.â€
�
Hadian said that despite his global advances , Rouhani faces pressure from hardliners domestically .
â€œHis opponents want to limit his power in the political sphere , especially in regards to the civil society and social freedoms .
They have all the means and the facilities to prevent him from doing so.â€ �
The reformists want him to deliver on social freedoms , especially human rights , Hadian said , but the conservatives want him to remain loyal to revolutionary values .
â€œHis biggest challenge and priority in the second term will be the economy .
â€œThe nuclear deal wonâ€
™ t collapse because of Iran .
There is a consensus inside the country that the nuclear deal should survive , so Iran wonâ€ ™ t violate first , but if the US wants to make excuses and , for example , demand inspection of military sites without any valid evidence then the world knows what the US is up to .
The world is not stupid.â€ �"
2017-09-20,"Good morning , this is Graham Russell taking over briefly to bring you the main stories and must - reads on Thursday 21 September .
Top stories Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s speech to the UN general assembly was â€œignorant , absurd and hateful rhetoricâ€ � that was â€œunfit to be heard at the United Nationsâ€ � , Iranâ€ ™ s president , Hassan Rouhani , has said .
Speaking at the UN a day after Trumpâ€ ™ s bombastic speech in which he threatened to â€œtotally destroyâ€ � North Korea , Rouhani also said his country would respond â€œdecisively and resolutelyâ€ � if the US were to walk away from the nuclear deal agreed with other countries in 2015 .
â€œIt would be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics , â€ �
Rouhani said .
Hillary Clinton has said Trumpâ€ ™ s speech was â€œdark , dangerousâ€ � .
On Wednesday , Trump told journalists he had decided whether to withdraw certification of the 2015 nuclear deal by a congressional deadline of 15 October .
The US president â€ “ a former TV reality show host who clearly enjoys building anticipation for his announcements â€ “ said â€œI have decidedâ€ � and repeated it three times , but did not say what he had decided , telling reporters : â€œIâ€ ™ ll let you know.â€ �
If he does not certify the agreement , under which Iran radically reduced its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief , Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose US sanctions .
If the legislature makes no decision , the onus passes back to the president .
The other signatories of the agreement â€ “ the UK , France , Germany , Russia and China â€
“ have confirmed Iran is sticking to its obligations , and have urged Washington not to walk away from the deal .
Trump was also criticised at the UN by a less expected source â€ “ British prime minister Theresa May urged leaders to maintain a â€œrules - basedâ€ � international order , including support for the Paris climate change accord that Trump rejects .
Mexican president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto has declared three days of national mourning after the country was hit by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that has so far killed 225 people .
