2007-11-10,"Brazil was celebrating one of the world 's biggest oil discoveries of recent years yesterday , a huge deposit off the coastline of Rio de Janeiro , which officials claim will take it into the major league of the world 's biggest energy powers .
The find at the Tupi field , about 155 miles off Rio , could yield a total of 8bn barrels of light crude and represent 40 % of the oil ever found in Brazil .
Dilma Rousseff , chief of staff in the president 's office and tipped as a possible successor , said the discovery could propel Brazil "" to the level of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela "" .
"" This has changed our reality , "" she said .
"" It is something that could contribute to Brazil moving from an intermediate nation in the petrol sector to another level . ""
The Correio Braziliense newspaper heralded the discovery with the headline God is Brazilian .
The find could propel Brazil into the "" first division of petrol producers and exporters "" , it added .
Oil experts said it was the biggest find anywhere in the world for at least seven years and would push Brazil 's reserves into the global top 10 but comparisons to Saudi Arabia may be over - optimistic .
Brazil 's total reserves will rise to about 20bn barrels as a result of the discovery , compared with Saudi Arabia 's 260bn , whose daily production is four times that of the Brazil .
The share price of Brazil 's state oil company Petrobras , which owns 65 % of the field , rose by about 14 % after the announcement .
The price of the British BG Group , which owns a 25 % stake , also rose .
"" If confirmed , the recoverable volumes of oil and gas will lift significantly the quantity of existing oil in Brazilian basins , putting Brazil among the countries with big reserves of oil and gas , "" the company said .
It described the Tupi field as the first part of a new oil "" frontier "" which potentially stretched for some 500 miles along the Brazilian coastline .
According to Petrobras , Brazil has the 24th biggest oil reserves in the world .
The company said the find could push South America 's biggest country up to ninth place .
But analysts said the find would not immediately solve Brazil 's energy crisis .
The country 's natural gas sector has been in trouble since May last year when the Bolivian president , Evo Morales , moved to nationalise his country 's gas and oil fields , on which Brazil is heavily dependant .
Adriano Pires , an energy expert from the Brazilian centre of infrastructure , said while the discovery was important the government had "" put on this [ media ] show to divert the focus of attention from the gas crisis and the critical situation of the Brazilian electricity sector "" .
"" In the short term this does not solve in any way the energy problems the country is suffering from , "" he said .
Relief for global oil markets , which have soared in recent months to all time highs close to $ 100 a barrel , will not come in the near future .
Full - scale production will not start for at least five years and getting the oil out will be expensive and difficult because it is so deep under the surface .
The discovery is also unlikely to divert Brazil from its development of biofuels .
Brazil is the world 's biggest producer of ethanol .
Emilio La Rovere , a biofuel expert from Rio 's federal university , said that in the long term the discovery was unlikely to change Brazil 's focus on alternative fuels such as ethanol . ""
The fact that this big reserve has been discovered and that Brazil is starting to think about being a producer does not mean that Brazil will abandon this , "" he said .
But , he said , in the short term the discovery might mean that there would not be "" such a great urgency in the economic sense "" in pursuing alternative fuels ."
2008-05-12,"President Lula 's chief of staff , Dilma Rousseff , appeared before an ethics committee of the Brazilian parliament last week to be grilled about her role in allegedly gathering personal information to smear her political opponents .
She denied any wrong - doing and despite nine hours of intensive questioning opposition politicians were unable to make any of their accusations stick .
In slight desperation , Jose Agripinio Maia the leader of the right - wing Democrats party sneered at her "" well you have admitted that you 've lied before so how do we know that you are telling the truth now ?
"" The jibe was a cheap one because Rousseff had been imprisoned and savagely tortured by Brazil 's military dictatorship and has subsequently stated that she told lies to protect her comrades .
Agripinio had been a member of the ARENA party at the time , which supported the dictatorship , and so Rousseff 's rejoinder that she was proud not to have been broken by her interrogators brought a strong and emotional response .
Rousseff is being groomed as a potential successor to President Lula when he steps down from office in 2010 .
The president currently has a 70 % popular approval rating , which is a quite astonishing figure after five and a half years in office .
Supporters of the British Labour party , still reeling after their local election drubbing could do worse than look to the success of his Brazilian Workers Party ( PT ) for some lessons .
Like Labour , PT 's origins lie in the trade union movement , although both parties have also always sought to draw support from wider social movements .
The Methodist church 's influence on Labour 's development is mirrored by the role of Catholic liberation theology in PT .
Both parties are reformist rather than revolutionary and President Lula 's election victory in 2002 borrowed some presentational tactics from New Labour 's 1997 triumph - although Labour 's Peter Mandelson campaigned for his rightwing opponent .
PT have pursued a cautious macro - economic strategy , in its first five years in office , using high interest rates to control inflation and running a fiscal surplus to reduce the public debt .
The economy is booming , buoyed by the high price of its commodity exports , and , together with the effect of the government 's social programmes , this has helped to raise living standards and reduce inequality .
However , PT has never attempted to embrace the populist authoritarianism by which New Labour has defined itself .
There is no equivalent to the type of proposals for identity cards or 42 day detentions in PT 's political programme and it would be inconceivable for one of its ministers to make the sort of remark that Caroline Flint did recently about evicting jobless people from their council homes .
In fact PT have shown considerable courage in confronting some of the populist "" common sense "" attitudes of Brazilian society whose crudeness on the issue of law and order was recently demonstrated by the success of the film Tropa de Elite .
Tarso Genro , Brazil 's minister for justice , opposes reducing the age of criminal responsibility .
Jose Temporao , the minister for health , has called for the reform of Brazil 's law on abortion .
Gilberto Gil , the pop star minister for culture , has called for the legalisation of cannabis and admits , without regret , to having smoked it for years .
None of these issues are vote winners in a conservative Catholic country like Brazil , but , given that PT is a left of centre political party , it is not considered exceptional that its members have left of centre political views .
What made New Labour always come across as a bit weird was that it , although its roots are on the left , its leaders have expressed extremely right wing views on a range of social issues .
This strategy was adopted back in the mid 1990s and was directly inspired by the success of Bill Clinton 's make - over of the Democratic party in the United States .
Clinton famously interrupted his campaign to sign the death warrant of a brain damaged prisoner in Arkansas , whose comprehension of what was happening to him was so limited that he left the desert of his final meal because he wanted to "" save it for later .
"" Blair and Brown were so impressed that they dreamt up their own series of , largely symbolic , gestures to show that Labour had also broken with its past .
New Labour defined itself as much by being against "" Old Labour "" as it was against the Tories .
The "" triangulation "" strategy was essentially dishonest , in that it compelled lots of Labour politicians to say things that they did not really believe in , but it is hardly a revelation to say that politicians are capable of doing this .
The strategy probably contributed to the scale of Labour 's landslide win in 1997 , although its two re - elections were mainly due to the favourable state of the economy and the lack of a credible opposition party .
Now that it has neither factor in its favour , the problems are more apparent .
As Polly Toynbee has noted triangulation means that Labour has "" nothing left to say and no territory to call its own "" .
Brown is now even more unpopular than Blair because the voters are tired , not so much of being lied to , but because the lies are so self - serving and transparently awful .
Even worse is that , once you peel them away , it is quite difficult to know what New Labour really believes .
PT has had its share of problems in office , most notably a corruption scandal which led to the arrest of virtually its entire leadership .
But , since most Brazilians think that all of their politicians are as corrupt as one another , the mensalao scandal did not deliver PT a knock - out blow .
One of the reasons for PT 's recovery is that its members are proud of their historical roots , in the struggle against the dictatorship , and of their links to the trade unions and the Brazilian social movements .
New Labour has destroyed much of its own traditional hinter - land and this has left it more exposed in its current crisis .
There is no shortage of people advising Brown , or whoever succeeds him , about the sort of policy measures that might help turn Labour 's fortunes around this side of the next general election .
What the experiences of PT , and dozens of other left of centre parties around the world , show , though , is that you can not stay in power indefinitely by pretending to be something that you are not .
The voters find you out eventually and it is a lie that they do not forgive ."
2009-08-25,"Last week 's resignation from the Brazilian Workers party ( PT ) by Marina Silva , the country 's former environment minister , is only the most high profile of the blows that President Lula 's administration has just suffered .
Silva resigned from the government itself last May after a series of disagreements with other ministers , including Lula 's chief of staff and chosen successor , Dilma Rousseff .
Quitting the party she has belonged to for more than 30 years clears the way for her candidacy in next year 's presidential elections for the Greens .
She is extremely unlikely to win this but she could fatally weaken Rousseff 's own presidential bid .
Rousseff has been gaining in the polls in recent months but still lags behind two potential candidates from PT 's main rival the Brazilian Social Democratic Party ( PSDB ) :
José Serra , the current governor of São Paulo , and Aécio Neves , the governor of Minas Gerais .
Lula is constitutionally required to step down after two terms in office , and PT is hoping that enough of his phenomenal personal popularity will rub off on Rousseff – who cuts a rather dour figure despite her history as a former guerrilla and political prisoner .
He has called her the "" mother "" of his economic development programme and accompanies her constantly at meetings across the country .
The Brazilian economy bounced out of recession fast and Lula 's international stature is growing , so the strategy might work , but it has hit a number of bumps in the road in recent weeks .
The biggest of these comes in the shape of the current president of the senate and former president of Brazil , José Sarney , who has been the target of repeated allegations of corruption , cronyism and family nepotism .
Sarney , who the Economist recently described as a dinosaur , sums up what many Brazilians think is worst about their country 's politicians .
But his centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) is a key component of the political alliance PT needs for its presidential campaign .
Lula has exhorted his party to put the equivalent of a clothes peg on its nose and support Sarney .
He is also pressing PT to make local pacts with PMDB , which often requires them to stand down their own candidates in places where they have a shot at winning seats .
Much of the support that PT historically enjoyed was because of its reputation as a "" clean hands "" party , so the strategy is causing widespread internal unease .
Last week matters came to a head in a Senate vote when PT 's parliamentary leader threatened to quit if his party 's representatives on a committee were forced to back Sarney , then did n't when they did .
Silva was one of a number of people who resigned from the party in the aftermath of this debacle and many regard it as the worst split that PT has suffered since the mensalão corruption crisis of its first term .
Lula survived that incident and came back to win a second term , convincingly seeing off both the PSDB challenger and two former PT dissidents – from the party 's middle - class intellectual wing – who ran against him .
However , Silva represents a deeper and more emotional link with PT 's roots .
Born in an impoverished community of rubber tappers in the remote Amazon state , she was orphaned at 16 and was illiterate until her early teens .
She joined PT along with Chico Mendes , the murdered trade unionist and environmental activist who is still venerated as a virtual saint within the party .
She became Brazil 's youngest ever female senator and won a string of international awards for her defence of the environment and its people .
An evangelical Protestant who holds fundamentalist views on a number of social issues , she will nevertheless be a difficult candidate for PT to attack during the election and will pick up a large protest vote from many of its natural supporters .
In the meantime , Rousseff 's candidacy has been damaged by an as yet unproved allegation that she ordered a public employee to help cover up corruption allegations in the Sarney case .
Her recent battle with cancer has won her public sympathy , but also raised concerns about whether she is strong enough for an arduous campaign – and the job itself .
This week rumours began circulating that PT was considering a possible alternative candidate , Antonio Palocci , a former finance minister , who was forced to resign around the time of the mensalao scandal .
Palocci is hoping to soon be officially cleared of any wrongdoing .
He also has a base of support in São Paulo , Brazil 's largest state and the heartland of PSDB 's Jose Serra .
However , the fact that no one has yet been convicted in relation to this scandal – the biggest in Brazilian political history – makes its legacy potent and swapping candidates this late into the race could prove problematic .
PT 's basic difficulty is that the party has always been weaker than its charismatic leader .
Lula 's decision not to push for a constitutional amendment to allow him to run for another term , as has happened elsewhere in Latin America recently , has undoubtedly strengthened Brazil 's still fledgling democracy .
But the loss of Silva , who was its best known figure internationally after Lula himself , makes it even harder for the party to define what it still stands for ."
2009-11-10,"The Brazilian government is preparing to pledge a big curb in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 as a "" political gesture "" aimed at pressing rich nations into agreeing to large cuts in carbon .
The country 's chief of staff , Dilma Rousseff , said Brazil would take proposals for voluntary reductions of 38 - 42 % by 2020 to the Copenhagen climate change summit next month .
The reductions are from projected 2020 emissions levels if no action was taken . ""
What Brazil is doing is a political gesture , "" said Rouseff , following a climate change meeting in Sao Paulo yesterday .
"" We still believe that the responsibility belongs to the developed countries . ""
She said the reductions were voluntary , and not binding "" targets "" , which she said should only be set for developed countries with higher emissions .
Rouseff 's intervention strikes at the core of the impasse in the global warming talks .
Scientists say rich nations with long polluting histories , like the US , need to cut emissions by 25 - 40 % by 2020 on 1990 levels , but the offers on the negotiating table fall short of this .
Poorer developing nations need , say experts , to cut their emissions by 15 - 30 % by 2020 compared to business - as - usual .
By stepping up to its side of the deal , Brazil is making an open challenge to the US , where Senate legislation on climate change is near deadlocked .
Half of Brazil 's proposed cuts will come from a reduction in deforestation , while the remaining 20 % relates to industry and farming .
"" We are already an example to the world .
But the fact that we are going to announce a significant objective does not mean we do not know that the responsible ones are the developed countries , "" Rousseff said .
Brazil 's official position for the Copenhagen talks is expected to be announced before this weekend .
Brazilian negotiators are already expected to announce plans to cut deforestation by 80 % by 2020 .
Sergio Leitao , the director of public policies for Greenpeace Brasil , said that the proposed numbers "" were good "" but that the Brazilian government needed to take on "" concrete targets "" not voluntary reductions : "" If it does n't , nobody will do anything . ""
The recent emergence of rainforest defender , Marina Silva , as a potential presidential candidate for next year 's elections , has helped propel the environment back onto the political agenda in Brazil .
Rousseff , a Workers ' party minister , who is president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 's favoured presidential candidate , is set to travel to Copenhagen next month to lead the Brazilian climate change delegation ."
2010-02-21,"Brazil 's ruling Workers ' party has nominated President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva 's chief of staff , Dilma Rousseff , to replace him , raising the prospect of the country 's first woman president .
Lula , who can not stand for a third term , picked the 62-year - old guerrilla leader turned economist to carry his centre - left banner in October 's election .
A party congress endorsed her with a banner which read "" With Dilma , along the path that Lula showed us "" .
Rousseff has never run for public office and lags behind a conservative rival , Sao Paulo governor Jose Serra , but polls show the gap narrowing ."
2010-03-14,"She has never been elected to office , hardly radiates charisma and inhabits a political landscape dominated by men , but Dilma Rousseff has a great chance of becoming Brazil 's next president .
Once dismissed as simply an acolyte of her boss , President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , she has clinched the ruling party 's nomination for October 's presidential election and is riding high in the polls .
Analysts who wrote off Rousseff , right , now tip her as a favourite to take charge of a booming economy with almost 200 million people and become the most powerful leader â€ “ male or female â€ “ in Latin America .
Lula , who steps down with stellar ratings after eight years in office , said the first sign "" that machismo will be defeated "" was selecting his chief of staff as a successor . ""
She wo n't only carry on [ my legacy ] , butâ€ ¦ perfect it and do much more , "" he said .
An increasing number of Brazilians agree .
After languishing in the polls a distant second to her conservative rival , SÃ£o Paulo governor JosÃ © Serra , Rousseff , 62 , has closed the gap to just four points .
Serra 's backers are growing anxious and in the past week a would - be running mate has cried off .
The daughter of a Belo Horizonte teacher
, she became a middle - class radical and joined the underground leftist resistance to the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 .
Details of her guerrilla days are sketchy but it is said she helped in the famous robbery of $ 2.4 m from the safe of a corrupt former SÃ£o Paulo governor .
She was jailed for almost three years and tortured , including receiving electric shocks .
After democracy 's restoration she became a state energy secretary , caught Lula 's eye and became his cabinet enforcer .
The former Trotskyist impressed colleagues and business leaders as a pragmatist and gifted administrator .
Charming in private , Rousseff is an awkward public speaker with a somewhat dour image .
Her biggest asset is Lula 's backing .
"" If Dilma was n't capable , if she had problems , I would n't have proposed Dilma , "" he said .
Rousseff 's challenge will be to reflect Lula 's shine while convincing voters she has her own vision of where to lead South America 's giant ."
2010-10-01,"Searchlights illuminated the night sky above the RecNov television centre in western Rio and rain poured down on to the sprawling factory of tear - jerking Brazilian soap operas .
Inside Studio J a 62-year - old woman , clad in white , stared into the camera and began her pitch . ""
I represent a project to transform Brazil , "" she told the millions of Brazilian voters who had crowded around TV sets from inner - city Rio to remote Amazon towns . ""
Yes , it is possible for a woman to be the president of the republic
and I know you will support this project .
"" It was just after 9 pm and Dilma Rousseff , a dog - loving , Proust - obsessed former Marxist rebel , was basking in her role as the grande dame of Brazilian politics .
By Sunday she may well also be the country 's first "" presidenta "" , as Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , the country 's first working - class leader , comes to the end of his second term in office .
"" Women are ready to govern Brazil and more importantly Brazil is ready to be governed by a woman , "" Rousseff , a member of Lula 's Workers Party ( PT ) since 2000 , said in a recent interview , adding that women were "" sensible , practical and sensitive "" .
"" These are important qualities for someone who wants to govern a country . "" .
A career civil servant , Rousseff is notorious for lacking the personality of her charismatic mentor , Lula .
Yet her story is scarcely less compelling .
Born to a Bulgarian father and a Brazilian mother , Rousseff spent nearly three years behind bars after clashing with Brazil 's dictatorship before rising to become one of the country 's most powerful women .
South America 's largest democracy goes to the polls on Sunday , and Rousseff currently tops the polls with about 50 % .
Fernando Pimentel , the former mayor of Belo Horizonte and one of Rousseff 's oldest friends , charts her political awakening back to her high - school days when she became involved in social work in one of the city 's oldest favelas , the Morro do Papagaio .
The impoverished hillside slum near her upmarket childhood home provided her first glimpse of Brazil 's vast inequalities .
"" It gave her a certain contact with poverty which she would n't otherwise have had , coming from a middle - upper - class family , "" Pimentel said .
After leaving school in the mid-1960s , Rousseff and Pimentel grew increasingly involved in politics .
As Brazil descended into the repressive 1964 - 1985 dictatorship the pair joined the underground National Liberation Command , or Colina group .
While she denies involvement in violence , saying she was too short - sighted to use a rife , she says : "" I was good at cleaning a gun .
I still know how to take one apart and put it back together again . ""
In 1970 Pimentel and Rousseff , who had gone into hiding in different parts of Brazil , were arrested and spent several years in military jails .
They were tortured with electric shocks and beatings .
On release Rousseff relocated to southern Brazil and completed an economics degree before starting life as a public administrator .
In 1986 she became Porto Alegre 's finance minister , the first of many administrative posts that eventually led to a place in President Lula 's cabinet , as energy minister , then chief of staff .
Pimentel said Rousseff was "" an avid reader â€ ¦ with an enormous intellectual curiosity .
She reads everything from classics such as Proust to books about macro - economics . ""
Recently she had been swotting up on Brazil 's Latin American neighbours , he said .
This year , for the first time in Brazilian history , there are two women at the forefront of the presidential race .
Also running is the rainforest defender and Green party member Marina Silva , who has around 14 % of intended votes .
FÃ¡tima Pacheco
JordÃ£o , a Brazilian sociologist from the PatrÃ­cia
GalvÃ£o Institute , said it was "" absolutely unprecedented "" to have two competitive female candidates running for the presidency .
"" I think it brings us a great potential for change , "" said JordÃ£o , adding that voters saw in a female candidate the possibility of "" new values and new ways of doing politics "" .
"" The historic absence of women in politics has meant that society has been able to see in â€ ¦
[ Rousseff ] something that represents an advance , that represents a correction of Brazilian politics in terms of corruption , equality and the gender divide , "" she said .
"" I 'm convinced that a great part of Dilma 's success is down to her being a woman , and not just about the support of President Lula , "" she added .
The role of women in Brazil 's 2010 elections is not just about the candidates .
With Rousseff keen to avoid a second round , analysts say female support , particularly in the south - eastern states of SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais , will prove decisive .
"" The female vote is absolutely strategic for defining whether there will be a second round or not , "" said JordÃ£o .
"" If Dilma can win over female voters in these states she 'll seal it in the first round .
The women will decide .
"" The candidates know this .
Rousseff has portrayed herself as the "" mother "" of Brazil 's economic advances , while , at Sunday 's debate , Marina Silva urged Brazilians to vote for an all - female second round , promising "" a dignified life for every Brazilian , above all for Brazilian women "" . ""
After 500 years Brazilians want a woman as president of the republic , "" she said after the debate .
Rousseff 's main opponent , the Social Democrat JosÃ © Serra , attacked the current administration 's ties with Iran . ""
Over the last few years the Brazilian government has allied itself with dictatorial regimes , like Iran 's , that persecute and mistreat women , "" he said .
Such criticism is unlikely to change the election 's outcome .
While a recent string of corruption allegations against the government have seen Rousseff dip slightly in the polls , few believe they will derail her bid to become president .
"" We have lifted 28 million people out of poverty and put 36 million Brazilians into the middle classes , "" Rousseff boasted , back at the RecNov studios . ""
This is not about me .
I intend to make the dreams of millions of Brazilians come true . """
2010-10-03,"Ruling party candidate Dilma Rousseff has taken an early lead in Brazil 's presidential election â€ “ but a second - round vote is possible , an exit poll has indicated .
Rousseff , who could become the first woman to lead South America 's largest democracy , is ahead in the race , but lacks the majority of votes needed to avoid a run - off , results show .
The former guerrilla leader , 62 , who has vowed to build on Brazil 's recent economic boom , has 43.6 % of valid votes , with 51 % of ballots counted , according to the electoral authority .
Opposition candidate Joe Serra , of the Social Democrats has 34.9 % of votes .
The early results were mostly from the fairly wealthy south , where Serra 's support is strongest .
Rousseff , who has the backing of her former boss , the outgoing president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , needs a majority of valid votes to avoid a run - off on 31 October .
She has the support of 51 % of voters , versus Serra 's 30 % , a nationwide exit poll by the Ibope polling firm showed .
It has a margin of error of just two percentage points .
A last - minute corruption scandal and voter doubts about Rousseff 's views on social issues narrowed her margin over Serra toward the end of the campaign .
Rousseff , described as a "" dog - loving , Proust - obsessed former Marxist rebel "" , has ruled out major changes to labour laws and other reforms that many investors believe will keep Brazil 's economy booming .
Antonia Monteiro da Silva , a 53-year - old cleaning lady in the capital , Brasilia , said that before Lula , she "" did n't even have chicken "" at home . ""
Thanks to God , my freezer is full of meat , and we do n't want for anything , "" she said ."
2010-10-04,"Brazil looked to have fallen short of electing its first female president last night , with Dilma Rousseff appearing to have to go into to a second round run - off .
With 90 % of votes counted , Rousseff had in the region of 46 % ; to win outright she would have needed more than 50 % .
One "" well - placed "" source within the Rousseff camp told Reuters there was "" no way "" she would take the first round , although Rouseff , a former guerrilla , had the backing of the retiring president , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
Her rival , the Social Democrat Jose Serra , had just over 33 % , while Marina Silva , an Amazon - born Green party candidate , had 20 % .
Silva , a former rubber - tapper who was environment minister before she quit Lula 's Workers ' party in 2009 , has had a surge in support , particularly in the cities .
More than 135 million Brazilians went to the polls yesterday to elect senators , state governors , MPs and a president .
While Rousseff , 62 , Lula 's former chief of staff , enjoys the support of the hugely popular leftwing leader , she lacks the charisma and recognition of her political mentor .
Some voters are unsure of her name , while many refer to her simply as "" Lula 's woman "" .
One Rio de Janeiro voter told the Guardian this week he planned to vote for Lula 's candidate , "" Telma "" .
Early yesterday Lula appeared to admit the possibility of a second round ; he first ran for the presidency in 1989 but was elected only in 2002 .
"" I did n't win any election in the first round , "" he told reporters .
He played down the consequences of a run - off saying it would merely give Rousseff another "" 30 days to fight "" .
Commentators , however , suggest many Silva voters could shift to Serra rather than Rousseff .
On the eve of the election , the Workers ' party ( PT ) members and candidates insisted they were still confident of a first - round victory , despite the fall - out of a recent corruption scandal involving politicians close to Rousseff that appears to have dented her support .
Vladimir Palmeira , one of the founders of the PT and a candidate for Brazil 's Congress in Rio de Janeiro , said a Rousseff victory would give Brazil "" another eight years of centre - left , if not exactly left - wing government in Brazil . """
2010-10-04,"A late surge by the Green party candidate has forced Brazil 's presidential election into a second round , with Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva 's favoured successor narrowly failing to become the nation 's first female leader .
Exit polls had suggested Dilma Rousseff , a former leftwing rebel , might still scrape a narrow first - round victory despite falling away in the polls in recent weeks .
But the Workers ' party ( PT ) candidate fell short of the 50 % needed , taking 47 % of the vote .
The Greens ' Marina Silva , a former rubber - tapper and staunch defender of the Amazon rainforest , got 19 % , while Rousseff 's main rival , JosÃ © Serra , the Social Democrat , took nearly 33 % .
Rousseff will face Serra in the second round on 31 October .
Silva , who quit as Lula 's environment minister after reputedly falling out with Rousseff , will not dispute the second round .
But her higher than expected result stripped vital support from Lula 's candidate and transformed her into a potential king or queen - maker in the second round .
Speaking after the result a visibly ecstatic Silva said the country now had a "" second chance to debate Brazil 's future , present and past "" .
"" These results are the worst imaginable for the government , "" Merval Pereira , a respected political columnist , told TV Globo , pointing to a PT defeat in the race for governor of SÃ£o Paulo as well as Rousseff 's failure to achieve an outright win . ""
Dilma 's vote was far below what the polls predicted .
"" Flanked by stony - faced allies , a noticeably subdued Rousseff tried to put on a brave face claiming a second round would give her "" more time "" to detail her proposals .
"" We are used to challenges and traditionally we have done very well in second rounds , "" she said .
"" This second stage will start tomorrow â€ ¦ and for me it has been very important to have got this far . ""
While Rousseff , Lula 's former chief of staff , has the endorsement of Brazil 's hugely popular leftwing leader and remains the favourite , she lacks her mentor 's charisma .
Some voters remain unsure of her name , referring to the presidential frontrunner simply as "" Lula 's woman "" .
One voter in Rio de Janeiro told the Guardian this week he planned to vote for Lula 's candidate , "" Telma "" .
Political analysts are divided on which candidate Marina Silva might support in the second round â€ “ if she supports anyone at all .
One recent poll suggested a significant number of her voters could shift their support to Jose Serra rather than Rousseff in the runoff .
In the run up to the campaign Serra reportedly attempted to convince Silva to stand as his vice - presidential candidate but his approaches were rejected .
Analysts suggest he may now repeat his offer or look to Fernando Gabeira , another prominent Green party member who has lost out in the race to become Rio de Janeiro 's governor ."
2010-10-04,"Despite having the full weight of the most popular president in Brazilian history behind her , Dilma Rousseff , the candidate from Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva 's left - leaning Workers ' party ( PT ) , failed to win an outright majority in Sunday 's election .
Though a surprise to pollsters and surely unwelcome news for Dilma 's camp , the outcome is not so extraordinary .
Lula himself never managed to clear the 50 % hurdle required to avoid a runoff , and Dilma 's campaign was based almost entirely on his support .
As he did twice , she will take her campaign to a second round , and will face the centre - right candidate , JosÃ © Serra , on October 31 .
The big difference this time was the rise of a powerful third candidate in the form of the Green party 's Marina Silva , Lula 's former environment minister , who got around 20 % of the vote .
At the time of writing , Dilma had 48 % and Serra 33 % .
A few weeks ago , Dilma looked unstoppable , but a scandal brought down her successor as Lula 's chief of staff , whose family was accused of selling political influence .
Relatively few voters held Dilma responsible for the actions of the son of a former adviser , but the small movement in the polls was enough to bring her close to the 50 % mark .
Serra , the former governor of Brazil 's largest state , who represents the same party as Lula 's predecessor , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , was the major opposition candidate and should have been natural beneficiary of these swing votes .
But he has so far failed to fully elaborate on an alternative vision for the country and the last - minute bump largely went to Marina , whose quiet dignity and support for the environment was never really in danger of being corrupted by actual power .
She 's now out of the race , but could perhaps throw her support behind one of the two candidates ; if she chose Serra , she might for the first time open up the possibility that Dilma wo n't win .
That would be a major coup .
Marina 's supporters have tended to split down the middle when asked if they 'd prefer Serra or Dilma , and Lula 's protegÃ
© e will still likely win control of the hemisphere 's second largest country .
That Dilma did so well is certainly a testament to the power of Lula .
The former leftwing labour leader will leave office with 80 % approval ratings , and these are not due only to his supremely charming persona and his common roots .
Since he took office eight years ago , the percentage of the population living in poverty has halved , Brazil has emerged as a global power , and the economy is expected to grow by over 7 % this year .
Critics will say some of this was luck , and that some of Brazil 's successes must be attributed to Cardoso , whose policies he largely kept in place
â€ “ there is truth in both , but there is no denying that the national mood is euphoric , and that much of this is down to Lula 's cheerful , competent leadership and his programmes for the country 's poor .
Quite simply , he decided that she would be the main candidate in this election , and made it so .
Relatively unknown to the public a few years ago , she has never held elected office .
At a rally in Lula 's home town this weekend , supporters were wearing T - shirts with two photos , reading , "" He [ Lula ] is designating her [ Dilma ] ! ! "" , as if to say : "" What is it that you do n't understand ?
"" There is every reason to believe she has the intelligence and the credentials for the job .
She was imprisoned for leftwing activities by the military dictatorship in her youth , and later gravitated to the centre and served as Lula 's energy minister and chief of staff .
She has run a smart campaign with few slip - ups .
But it proves nearly impossible to find a Dilma supporter who can explain their support without citing Lula .
The goal is continuity .
Lula 's government has come so close to the centre that "" the markets "" have largely treated it as a non - event , quite confident that neither candidate will shake things up too much .
International investors and local business leaders no longer fear PT leadership , as they did when Lula took over in 2003 , or when he first ran in 1989 and got over 40 % of the vote .
Indeed , some on the traditional left of the party criticise his economic orthodoxy .
Lula 's social programmes aimed at making progress in one of the world 's most unequal societies have been modest , but it took a team of former radicals to get even those instituted in the traditionally conservative , elite - dominated country .
Similarly , Serra did little in this campaign to mark himself as a rightwing candidate .
Indeed , he rarely differentiated himself from Lula , at some points even insisting on using his image in campaign material .
The second round may or may not bring policy differences between the two into sharper relief .
But politics is about more than good government .
It would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of the symbolism of affirming Lula 's period in office , when for the first time the Brazilian people saw their own face in the presidential palace and felt themselves respected on the world stage .
Only a victory for Dilma will do that ."
2010-10-04,"Environmental campaigners and Green party activists heralded a breakthrough today after a former rubber - tapper from the Brazilian Amazon who rose to be a world - famous rainforest defender became the central figure in the second round of the country 's presidential election .
Marina Silva , who was raised in the Amazon state of Acre and was illiterate until the age of 16 , failed to make the second round but came away with 19 % of the vote , far higher than pollsters had expected .
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 's chosen candidate , Dilma Rousseff , meanwhile missed out on a first - round majority , polling a disappointing 46.7 % .
With Rousseff 's main rival , the Social Democrat José Serra , taking just under 33 % of votes , Silva became the king or queen maker in the 31 October runoff when Serra and Rousseff do battle .
"" It is a spectacular result , "" Alfredo Sirkis , the Green party 's president in Rio de Janeiro , told the Guardian .
Sirkis said the record vote meant the Green party would be able to force debate on crucial environmental issues in the lead up to the second round .
Such issues included controversial changes to Brazil 's forestry code , which environmentalists claim will further damage the Amazon rainforest , and Brazil 's commitments on climate change in Copenhagen .
The O Dia newspaper in Rio de Janeiro , where Silva came second with 31.52 % of the vote , described a "" green tsunami "" in its front - page headline . ""
Marina Silva 's face will not be on the ballot on October 31 but her electoral ghost will decide the second round , "" the newspaper said .
"" She has become the central figure in this campaign , "" said Altino Machado , an Amazon journalist and blogger who has known Silva since the late 1970s .
Machado said Silva 's success showed "" the people 's desire for change "" .
"" There are nearly 20 million Brazilians who understood her positions and who voted for her as an alternative … believing in a utopia , a possible country . ""
Machado said the result would allow the country to debate not just Brazil 's "" commitment to development and the wellbeing of the population "" but also its "" commitment to environmental preservation "" .
Within minutes of last night 's result becoming clear , Serra was making public overtures to Silva .
He had originally tried to recruit her as his presidential running - mate .
"" I want to congratulate Marina for her significant vote , "" Serra said in Sao Paulo , adding that the Green party candidate had "" contributed to democracy in Brazil "" .
He said : "" Today I am all thanks . ""
Members of president Lula 's Workers ' party will also turn their attentions to Silva , who walked away from her job as his environment minister in 2008 after reportedly clashing with Rousseff .
Brazilian newspapers today reported that Lula would now take direct control over Rousseff 's campaign , in order to ensure her election .
Sirkis said it would take "" up to 15 days "" for the Green party to decide which of the candidates , if any , it might support .
"" We will meet the two candidates and then hold our convention [ to decide ] , "" he said .
"" There is clearly an anxiety in the Brazilian press to know if we will support Serra or Dilma .
[ But ] they will have to wait a while .
This decision can not be taken this week .
"" Machado , who used to act alongside Silva in an Amazon theatre group and was with her on Sunday , said it was unclear which way his friend would lean . ""
This is now the great mystery of Brazilian politics over the next few days : what will Marina do ?
"" he said ."
2010-10-27,"With the second round of Brazil 's presidential election just days away , campaigners are lamenting the lack of concrete proposals to tackle environmental issues such as Amazon deforestation and carbon emissions .
On Sunday Brazil will return to the polls to choose between the Workers ' party ( PT ) candidate Dilma Rousseff and her opponent JosÃ © Serra , from the Social Democratic party ( PSDB ) .
Rousseff was forced into a run - off after the Amazon - born Green party candidate Marina Silva polled an unexpected 19 % , sapping support from the former Marxist rebel .
While environmentalists had hoped that the jostle for Silva 's voters would launch green issues on to the political agenda , many believe a serious debate on sustainability and the environment has failed to materialise . ""
All either [ candidate ] is doing at the moment is talking , "" said Marcelo Furtado , Greenpeace 's executive director in Brazil .
"" One of the things we most regret is the lack of concrete commitments and concrete projects that show a dedication to sustainability . ""
At the start of the second - round campaign both candidates quickly tried to paint themselves green .
[ But ] this had to be followed by a deeper debate [ and ] â€ ¦ we do not see this discussion happening . ""
He also claimed Rousseff had privately resisted Brazil 's decision to present voluntary carbon reduction targets at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen last December .
Carlos Minc , Brazil 's former environment minister and one of the authors of Rousseff 's green programme , admitted the focus on "" religious "" issues such as abortion and gay marriage had initially hampered serious discussion of the environment .
This , however , had changed after he requested "" less holy water and more environment "" from Rousseff 's camp . ""
My calls were answered . ""
"" We are making progress on the environmental agenda , "" said Xico Graziano , Serra 's campaign coordinator and SÃ£o Paulo 's former environment secretary , who said his candidate had now vowed to impose a five - year deforestation moratorium .
"" I 'm not completely fulfilled but I 'm satisfied . ""
Last week Rousseff published a 13-point plan for "" sustainability with economic growth "" and reiterated previous pledges to cut Amazon deforestation by 80 % and emissions by around 39 % by 2020 .
She also promised to "" veto initiatives that imply an amnesty for deforesters "" â€ “ a reference to controversial proposals to alter Brazil 's forestry code which environmentalists believe would cause further rainforest destruction . ""
Dilma does not come from the ecological movement , "" said Minc .
"" She is a developmentalist but a developmentalist with strong environmental sensibilities . ""
As environment minister Minc said , Rousseff , then chief of staff , had backed him in eight of his 10 "" greatest wars "" in favour of the environment .
Minc claimed a Rousseff government would work to introduce wind , solar and biomass energy schemes and hoped to achieve an 80 % reduction in Amazon deforestation by 2012 â€ “ eight years ahead of schedule .
"" We are very close to getting [ reducing deforestation ] to 3,500 square kilometers [ a year ] , "" he said .
Graziano said Serra would commit to a policy of "" zero deforestation "" over the coming five years .
"" We should adopt a five - year moratorium on deforestation in [ the whole of ] Brazil , "" he said .
"" Even legally authorised deforestation would be suspended until we sort out the country 's environmental legislation . ""
During this period a Serra government would launch a fresh drive against illegal deforestation creating "" a specific Amazon police force to fight deforestation "" while simultaneously supporting those who wanted to work within the law .
A PSDB government would work to "" violently reduce "" illegal destruction , Graziano said .
Furtado of Greenpeace said candidates now had just a few days to start a serious discussion of environmental issues .
"" I hope that it is still possible to hear what the candidates propose on such issues â€
¦
If we do , it is Brazil that will end up winning . """
2010-10-29,"The second round of the presidential election in Brazil , a battle between JosÃ © Serra and Dilma Rousseff , the candidate of President Lula 's party , will come to an end on 31 October , after a three - month campaign .
Serra , the opposition candidate , has focused his campaign on accusations against Rousseff .
He has been joined by Catholic and Protestant leaders , who have openly criticised her for supporting the legalisation of abortion .
Extreme rightwing groups , which most people thought were extinct , have joined the attacks on blogs and websites , speculating about Rousseff 's supposedly hidden past .
Serra has occupied the rightwing , conservative ground , exploiting religious beliefs and a moralist rhetoric that appeals to much of the middle class .
But what is at stake in this election ?
As far as Brazil 's international strategic position is concerned , Rousseff will promote economic and political relations with southern , Latin American and Bric countries .
For Serra , such proximity brings more problems than benefits to Brazil .
He prefers bilateral agreements with northern countries .
In addition , Serra rejects the idea that Lula 's foreign policy , based on relations with the global south , drastically altered foreign perceptions about Brazil 's importance .
But Brazil 's growing status is confirmed by the double success of being awarded the Olympics and the World Cup .
On the domestic side , Rousseff promises to strengthen strategic state companies in which the government is the major stockholder , such as Petrobras , and to reverse the privatisation policies carried out during Cardoso 's government ( 1995 - 2002 ) .
Serra 's most important energy adviser , on the other hand , has recently rejected a state - based model for the exploration of a pre - salt oil reservoir , which holds more than 60bn barrels .
The agribusiness entrepreneurs , despite a big increase in profits and licences to expand plantation areas in forestry land during Lula 's government , are now supporting Serra .
The reason lies perhaps in Rousseff 's commitment to enforce the Copenhagen agreement and slow down the pace and extent of deforestation in the Amazon .
Marina Silva , the Green party 's candidate , recognised that the government 's candidate has included a larger number of Green proposals in her manifesto .
Rousseff 's popular support is mainly based on Lula 's social and economic policies .
Lula will end his second presidential term having created more than 15 m jobs .
In the north - eastern states , the regions with greatest social need , job creation was particularly high .
Social programmes , such as the Bolsa FamÃ­lia , have helped 11 million families and removed some 13 million people from absolute poverty , defined by less - than - a - dollar per day income .
Approximately 30 million people have joined the so - called C class , with a monthly income of more than $ 600 .
In the face of these figures , corruption accusations against members of Lula 's government and his Workers ' party seem of lesser importance .
Opposition politicians claim that Rousseff and her future government could jeopardise democratic institutions .
In fact , the advances in Brazilian democracy depend on extending popular control over government and public institutions .
Rousseff 's defeat would also represent a defeat for the somewhat erratic Latin American left .
Evo Morales in Bolivia and Hugo ChÃ¡vez in Venezuela received a big boost from Lula 's standing firm with the United States .
Lula 's government was not revolutionary and was involved in a number of indefensible situations .
A new environmental bill of rights , for instance , was approved but not enforced against big corporations .
Nevertheless , Lula 's undeniable social improvements help us imagine a more equal and socially balanced Brazil .
There is still a long way to go concerning the promotion of human rights and the improvement of basic provision in education and public health .
But what has been achieved so far is too precious to be placed at risk ."
2010-10-31,"Brazil was on the verge of electing its first female president today , with the first exit polls predicting that Dilma Rousseff , a former Marxist rebel , had won after taking 58 percent of the vote .
An estimated 135 million Brazilians were due to choose between Rousseff , the 62-year - old Workers ' party ( PT ) candidate , and Jose Serra , a 68-year - old former health minister from the Social Democracy party ( PSDB ) .
While the exits polls from Brazil 's Globo television network indicated that victory was in Rousseff 's grasp , electoral officials overseeing the official count said that with 85 percent of the vote counted , she was leading with 54.67 percent to Serra 's 45.33 percent .
Rousseff , the chosen successor of President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , was forced into a potentially tricky run - off with Serra earlier this month after a surprise showing from the Green party candidate Marina Silva denied her an outright majority .
But recent days have seen the book - loving former chief of staff pull away from her rival , opening up a 10 - 15 % lead by flaunting her relationship with President Lula on the airwaves and vowing to push on with his "" social revolution "" .
In a televised debate on Friday Rousseff , who had plastic surgery to boost her appeal , said : "" I promise to create a country filled with opportunities for everyone , where millions of Brazilians are able to enjoy access to the material benefits of civilisation . ""
Twenty - eight million Brazilians have been lifted out of poverty and I will remove the remaining 20 million . ""
Serra , meanwhile , has visited some 120 Brazilian cities in an attempt to rally support and reportedly indulged in daily doses of honey to improve his ability to communicate with voters .
While most observers believe Serra 's chances are slim , his campaign manager , Xico Graziano , suggested a low turnout , the result of an extended bank holiday in Brazil , could throw up a surprise result .
"" Thirty million [ Brazilians ] may not vote on Sunday , "" he said .
"" This could define the election . ""
But Jose Eduardo Dutra , the president of the PT , said he was confident of a Rousseff victory .
"" The trademark of [ a Rousseff ] government will be continuity , continuity with advances , "" he said .
"" We have had a government that has rescued the self - esteem of the Brazilian people and that has overcome a dogma that existed in Brazilian politics and economics â€ ¦ that Brazil was a country in which it was impossible to combine economic growth with income distribution , "" Dutra claimed .
"" Lula 's government did this [ and ] Dilma 's government will advance further in terms of reducing inequality . ""
The 65-year - old president voted in the manufacturing hub of Sao Bernardo do Campo on the outskirts of Sao Paulo , where he made his name as a fiery union boss . ""
What is important for us today is that once again the Brazilian people is consolidating the democratic process in Brazil , "" he said .
"" This election will have an extraordinary participation .
Everybody knows that I already have a candidate and that I 've worked for my candidate to be elected for the presidency .
I think Brazil must give continuity to this extraordinary moment it is going through .
"" Brazil 's next president will face a barrage of pressing issues after taking office on 1 January .
The value of Brazil 's currency , the real , has ballooned since President Lula took power , leaving exporters despondent and leading Goldman Sachs to classify the real as the most overvalued currency on Earth .
Public security remains a problem .
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have reduced their murder rates over recent years , but Brazil still has nearly 50,000 homicides per year .
South America 's largest nation is also facing a growing crack - cocaine problem .
A recent study by the Cebrid think - tank claimed nearly 9 % of nine to 18-year - old Brazilians use the drug .
With Brazil 's economy booming , analysts say investment in infrastructure and education is urgently needed to sustain growth levels .
"" Brazil will only leave behind its position as an emerging power and become a developed country if we guarantee quality education for our children , "" Rousseff said last week .
Latin America 's women leaders Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner , president of Argentina Cristina Kirchner , a 57-year - old lawyer 57 , a lawyer , swept into Argentina 's Casa Rosada in 2007 , becoming her country 's first democratically elected female president in 2007 .
Notorious for her penchant for designer clothes
She succeeded her husband , NÃ © stor Kirchner , who died last week , aged 60 .
A populist former senator , Cristina Kirchner came to power vowing to continue her husband 's drive against unemployment and inequality as the country continued its recovery from the 2001 financial crash .
"" I do n't want to be compared with Hillary Clinton , or with Evita Peron , or with anybody , "" Kirchner said before her 2007 victory .
"" There 's nothing better than being yourself . ""
Michelle Bachelet , former president of Chile A multilingual paediatrician , Michelle Bachelet became Chile 's first female president in 2006 , serving until 2010 .
Born in Santiago , to an air force commander and an archaeologist , She had been tortured and briefly imprisoned by Chile 's 1972 - 1990 dictatorship and had fled to Australia in 1975 .
Her meteoric rise to the presidency was preceded by roles as Chile 's health minister and then as Latin America 's first female defence minister .
Women 's groups praised her for allowing hospitals to give Chilean women emergency contraceptives .
As president she won praise from women 's groups for allowing government hospitals to distribute morning - after emergency contraceptives to Chilean women .
Last month Bachelet , a 59-year - old single mother and socialist , was appointed head of UN Women , a newly created United Nations unit for promoting women 's rights .
Eva PerÃ³n , former Argentinian first lady
Although never elected , Argentina 's first lady ( 1946 - 52 ) was widely considered one of South America 's most powerful women .
Eva PerÃ³n , better known as Evita , was Argentina 's first lady between 1946 and 1952 .
Although never elected to office , she was widely considered one of South America 's most powerful women .
Raised in rural poverty , PerÃ³n set off for Buenos Aires aged 15 , dreaming of an acting career .
Her 1945 marriage to presidential would - be Juan Domingo PerÃ³n catapulted Evita to stardom in her native country .
Between her husband 's election in 1946 and her premature death in 1952 , Evita became a South American icon .
To her legions of followers , she was a feminist icon and champion of the poor who dedicated her short life to Argentina 's poorest , los descamisados ( the shirtless ) ."
2010-11-01,"Like the rally led by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central that brought hundreds of thousands of people into the streets of Washington , DC on Saturday , Brazil 's election on Sunday was a contest of "" Restore Sanity "" versus "" Keep Fear Alive "" â€ “ but with the fate of millions of Brazilians seriously at stake .
Dilma Rousseff of the governing Workers ' party coasted to victory against the opposition candidate JosÃ © Serra , with a comfortable margin of 56 to 44 % .
It had been a bitter and ugly campaign , marked by allegations of corruption and malfeasance on both sides , ending with Serra 's wife calling Dilma a "" baby - killer . ""
Religious groups and leaders mobilised for the Serra campaign and accused Dilma of wanting to legalise abortion , ban religious symbols , being "" anti - Christian "" , and a "" terrorist "" for her resistance to the military dictatorship during the late 1960s .
The whole campaign was all too reminiscent of Republican strategies in the United States , going back to the rise of the religious right in the 1980s , through the "" Swift Boat "" politics and Karl Rove 's "" Weapons of Mass Distraction "" of recent years .
Serra even had a rightwing foreign policy strategy that prompted one critic to label him "" Serra Palin "" .
His campaign threatened to alienate Brazil from most of its neighbours by accusing the Bolivian government of being "" complicit "" in drug trafficking and Venezuela of "" sheltering "" the Farc ( the main guerrilla group ) in Colombia .
He attacked outgoing President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva for his refusal â€ “ along with most of the rest of South America â€ “ to recognise the government of Honduras .
The Honduran government was "" elected "" following a military coup last year , under conditions of censorship and human rights abuses such that only the United States and a handful of mostly rightwing allies recognised it as "" free and fair "" .
But in the end , sanity triumphed over fear , as voters proved to have been more convinced by the substantial improvements in their well - being during the Lula years than anything Serra had to offer .
It is perhaps not surprising that Serra , an economist , would try to find a way to avoid the most important economic issues that affect the lives of the majority of Brazilians .
The economy has performed much better during the Lula years than during the eight years of rule by Serra 's Social Democratic party ( PSDB ) : per capita income grew by 23 % from 2002 to 2010 , as opposed to just 3.5 % for 1994 to 2002 .
Measured unemployment is now at a record low of 6.2 % .
Perhaps even more importantly , the majority of Brazilians enjoyed substantial gains : the minimum wage , adjusted for inflation , grew by about 65 % during Lula 's presidency .
This is more than three times the increase during the prior eight years ( that is , the presidency of Fernando Henrique Cardoso , of Serra 's party ) .
This affects not only minimum - wage workers , but tens of millions of others whose income is tied to the minimum wage .
In addition , the government has expanded the Bolsa Familia programme , which provides small cash grants to poor families on condition of school attendance and health immunisation compliance .
The programme has been successful in reducing illiteracy , and now reaches about 13 m families .
More than 19 million people have been shifted across the poverty line since 2003 .
And a new scheme of subsidies for home ownership has benefitted hundreds of thousands of families , with millions likely to take part , as it expands .
Although the brand of Republican campaign strategy borrowed by Serra was effective for most of the last four decades in the United States , it has n't performed all that well as an export .
The Brazilian electorate tired quickly of the mudslinging ; and swing voters wanted to know what Serra would do for them that would be better than what the Workers ' party had done .
When he could n't tell them , he lost their votes .
On the down side , the negative campaigning prevented the election campaign generally from addressing some of the vital issues of Brazil 's future .
Brazil 's financial elite , which dominates the central bank , has an influence on economic policy that is at least as bad â€ “ and as powerful â€ “ as that of Wall Street in the United States .
This is one reason why Brazil , even under Lula , has had , for many years , the highest or near - highest real interest rates in the world .
Brazil 's growth performance has still not been on a par with the other "" Bric "" countries ( Russia , India , China ) , and the country will have to move away from some of the neoliberal policies of previous governments in order to achieve its potential .
Capital formation during the Lula years was not much different from during the Cardoso years , and was relatively low compared to many developing countries .
Public investment was even lower , although it has recently begun to accelerate .
The country will need a development strategy , and one that establishes new patterns of investment and consumption to advance the interests of the majority of Brazilians â€ “ some 50 million of whom remain in poverty .
The election has enormous implications for the western hemisphere , where the Obama State Department has continued , with barely a stutter , the Bush administration 's strategy of "" rollback "" against the unprecedented independence that the left governments of South America have won over the last decade .
A defeat of the Workers ' party would have been a big victory for the DC foreign policy establishment .
It also has implications for the rest of the world .
In May , Brazil and Turkey broke new ground in the world of international diplomacy , by negotiating a nuclear fuel swap arrangement for Iran , in an attempt to resolve the standoff over Iran 's nuclear programme .
The State Department was probably more upset about this than anything that Brazil had done in the region , including Lula 's strong and consistent support for the government of President Hugo ChavÃ © z in Venezuela .
Serra , for his part , had attacked the Iran deal during his campaign .
Outside of Washington , then , Dilma Rousseff 's win in this election , consolidating President Lula 's achievements , will be greeted as good news .

2010-11-01,"A former Marxist rebel who was jailed and tortured during Brazil 's military dictatorship last night became the first female president in her country 's history .
In her first speech as Brazil 's president - elect , Dilma Rousseff , who polled 56 % compared to her rival 's 44 % , vowed to eradicate extreme poverty in one of the world 's most unequal countries .
An estimated 135 million Brazilians went to the polls yesterday to choose between the 62-year - old economist , who was the handpicked successor of Brazil 's Workers ' Party ( PT ) president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and JosÃ © Serra , a 68-year - old former health minister who was running for president for the second , and almost certainly last , time .
Speaking at a victory rally in the capital , Brasilia , Rousseff told jubilant supporters : "" We can not rest while Brazilians are going hungry , while families are living in the streets , while poor children are abandoned to their own fates and while crack and crack dens rule . ""
"" The eradication of extreme poverty is a target that I assume and I humbly ask for the support of you all to help the country overcome this abyss that still separates us from being a developed nation , "" she added .
"" This ambitious goal will not be achieved by the government alone .
It is a call for the nation . ""
Rousseff , a notoriously tough technocrat who underwent plastic surgery to try to boost her appeal , had looked badly deflated after being forced into a second - round run - off with Serra earlier this month but recent polls showed her pulling away , largely thanks to Lula 's growing involvement in her campaign .
She won a landslide victory in Brazil 's impoverished northeast , where Lula was born , polling nearly 66 % compared to Serra 's 27.5 % and also dominated much of the Amazon region .
She takes power in a country on the rise , which is expected to be the world 's fifth - largest economy by the time it hosts the 2016 Summer Olympics .
In the lead - up to the election JosÃ © Eduardo Dutra , the PT 's president , said voters had been offered the choice of "" a model that attempted to include all Brazilians "" and one that promoted "" income concentration and â€ ¦ the growth of one group of Brazilians "" .
"" Dilma 's government will advance further in terms of reducing inequality , "" he said .
Despite the buoyant mood among PT leaders last night , the presidential race has inspired few voters on either side , with neither candidate enjoying Lula 's flair or wit .
Observers described the vote as more of a referendum on Lula , while the front - page headline of one Rio newspaper yesterday exclaimed :
"" Phew !
It 's over . ""
Many supporters hope Lula , who is likely to leave power on 1 January with approval ratings of over 80 % , will attempt a comeback , possibly as early as 2014 , the year Brazil hosts the World Cup .
"" There is a big possibility of â€ ¦ President [ Lula ] being a candidate again either in 2014 or in 2018 , "" admitted Marcia Carvalho Lopes , Brazil 's minister for social development .
Before then the new government will face a barrage of issues , not least fighting what the country 's finance minister recently called a global "" currency war "" .
The value of Brazil 's currency , the real , has ballooned since President Lula took power , leaving exporters despondent and leading Goldman Sachs to classify it as the most overvalued currency on earth .
Public security remains a major problem , with nearly 50,000 homicides per year .
The country is also facing a growing crack - cocaine crisis .
A recent study by the Cebrid thinktank claimed nearly 9 % of 9 - 18-year - old Brazilians use the drug .
With Brazil 's economy booming , analysts say that investment in infrastructure and education is needed to sustain growth .
"" Brazil will only leave behind its position as an emerging power and become a developed country if we guarantee quality education to our children , "" Rousseff admitted last week ."

2010-11-01,"Exactly 60 years after the election of Brazil 's first female MP , the country 's first female president has promised to fight for women 's rights with the battle cry : "" Yes , women can . ""
Speaking after her historic election on Sunday night , Dilma Rousseff echoed US president Barack Obama 's "" Yes , we can "" slogan , telling supporters : "" Equal opportunities for men and women are an essential principle of democracy .
"" I would like for fathers and mothers to look into their daughters ' eyes today and tell them : ' Yes , women can . '
I would like to register my first post - election commitment : to honour Brazilian women so that this unprecedented fact becomes a natural event . ""
Rousseff , 62 , who was elected with 56 % of the vote and became the eighth elected female president in Latin America and the Caribbean , will take office on 1 January .
She added that she would fight for greater opportunities for women "" in businesses , civil institutions â€ ¦ and in the whole of our society "" .
Brazil 's incoming president is widely tipped to promote several women to government positions , among them Maria das GraÃ§as Foster , a director at Brazil 's state - run energy company , Petrobras .
Foster is rumoured to be in line either to take over as the company 's chief executive or to head a ministry .
Marta Suplicy , SÃ£o Paulo 's former mayor and a woman that the local press call Rousseff 's "" first friend "" , was elected to Brazil 's senate with more than 8 m votes and will work closely with the new president .
NilcÃ © a Freire , the academic who led President Lula 's special secretariat for women 's policies
, may also get a role .
FÃ¡tima Pacheco
JordÃ£o , a Brazilian sociologist , said Rousseff 's allusion to the importance of women in democracy was a major advance that went beyond emotion and rhetoric .
"" Most important in this feminist - tinged speech was that she described the advance of gender equality issues as one of the foundations of democracy , "" she said .
"" Never has a [ Brazilian ] president treated the gender question in this way . ""
JordÃ£o said Rousseff 's recognition of the "" gender deficit "" gave her hope that she would follow women - friendly policies such as those introduced by Chile 's former president Michelle Bachelet , now head of UN Women .
"" It is possible [ Rousseff ] may introduce specific policies that are better than Lula 's without ever having promised them , "" she added .
Despite excitement over the election of Brazil 's first "" presidenta "" , most senior cabinet posts will still be occupied by men .
"" The proportion of women in politics in Brazil is very limited , worse than many Latin American countries and several in Africa , "" said JordÃ£o , pointing out that Rousseff 's campaign had focused on continuity not gender issues .
Whereas Obama 's campaign slogan had been ""
Yes , we can "" , JordÃ£o said Rousseff 's could have been : ""
Yes â€ “
it 's under control . """
2010-11-02,"Brazil 's president - elect , Dilma Rousseff , has promised that her incoming government will guarantee freedom of expression .
The pledge , made during her acceptance speech in BrasÃ­lia , follows a series of allegations about repeated attacks on press freedom during the lengthy election campaign .
Rousseff had previously said she was troubled by some news reports during her campaign : "" I do n't deny that sometimes [ the media ] spread things that left me sad , "" she said .
"" But we are lovers of freedom . ""

Rousseff is the handpicked successor of the current president , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and - like him - a member of the Workers ' Party .
Throughout the campaign , the party 's supporters and Lula 's spokespeople accused the press of acting as an opposition party determined to prevent Rousseff winning .
At one point , Lula said : "" We are the public opinion and we will not only defeat our [ political ] adversaries , we 'll beat some newspapers and magazines that behave as a political party "" .
He also accused various journalists of fabricating news .
But editors countered that their stories alleging corruption and nepotism involving Lula 's chief of staff , Erenice Guerra were valid .
She eventually resigned in the face of the newspaper revelations .
A newspaper editor in SÃ£o Paulo told me a couple of weeks ago of her concern about threats to press freedom .
She said : "" I 've not seen anything like it since 1989 , when we had our first presidential elections after the military dictatorship . ""
She pointed to the fact that one of Brazil 's leading dailies , O Estado de S. Paulo , is subject to a court order that forbids it from publishing stories about legal matters involving Fernando Sarney , the son of Brazil 's former president , JosÃ © Sarney , who is now senate speaker .

2010-11-04,"Back in August , then Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva offered sanctuary in his country to Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani , the Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning for the "" crime "" of adultery .
It was another moral and well - judged piece of diplomacy from the leader , who has just been replaced in presidential election by his protege , Dilma Rousseff .
Lula had taken big risks with his engagement of the Iranian regime , alongside Turkey , in order to find a peaceful resolution to the ongoing furore over the Iranian nuclear programme , which Iran says is for civilian purposes and the US and Israel say is for nuclear weapons .
The real strides made by Lula and Turkish premier Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan were purposefully ruined by a US - sponsored UN resolution , which imposed a fourth round of sanctions and jettisoned the valuable work they had done .
But in the aftermath , Lula rightly realised that he could use his influence to try to shame the Iranian regime from going forward with this barbaric death sentence .
Now , the situation became even more acute as the International Committee Against Stoning has said it has information that Ashtiani is to be executed imminently .
Lula 's intervention was true to form .
He is part of a historic movement in Latin America .
After centuries of foreign dominion and interference , a collection of independent leaders has sprung up from the ranks of the poor who genuinely represent their people and are building better societies across the region , from Hugo ChÃ¡vez in Venezuela to Evo Morales in Bolivia .
But most of these socialist leaders have made a strategic alliance with the Iranian regime as they try to build up relationships outside of US hegemony .
A trade relationship is understandable â€ “ the US has an ugly history of liquidating democracy in Latin America and installing their own tyrants to create a happy investment climate for their corporate interests .
It 's only rational that the new wave of leftwing leaders try to build independent groupings .
But if these socialist governments are giving hope to millions across the globe who want to build a better world , then with that comes huge responsibility â€ “ a responsibility that , on Iran , they have not met .
In fact , they have done the opposite .
Last week , there was a video of Evo Morales kicking around a football with the Holocaust - denying president of Iran before announcing a nuclear tie - up , and the week before , Hugo ChÃ¡vez was there breaking bread with the head of a regime which thinks nothing about hanging two gay teenagers from a crane .
There was not a whimper of comment from either on the barbarous nature of the government that was hosting them .
For those who have invested effort and hope in these governments , this was hard to take .
Not only would ChÃ¡vez and Morales be in the opposition if they lived in Iran , they would probably be sitting in jail and being tortured .
Because of their closeness to Iran , they have the power to shame its leaders into stopping the barbarous injustice of Ashtiani 's execution , and they must do it .
It is now incumbent on Hugo ChÃ¡vez , Rafael Correa and Evo Morales to join their comrade Lula and offer Ashtiani sanctuary in Latin America , while forcefully denouncing Iran 's human rights abuses of women and gay people .
It 's the very fact that the leaders of Latin America are different and have principles that makes it vital they speak out against the atrocities taking place and being planned in Iran .
It is to them that we look .
Offer Ashtiani sanctuary now .
Shame the Iranian regime to stop this outrage ."
2010-12-31,"He was Brazil 's first working - class president ; a football - obsessed former factory worker who swapped rural poverty for the highest office in his country and helped propel 20 million people out of poverty .
Tomorrow afternoon , the curtain will finally go down on Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 's eight - year reign when his successor , the former Marxist rebel Dilma Rousseff , steps out from a 1953 Rolls - Royce Silver Wraith and into the presidential hot seat .
Attended by 11 women with whom she was imprisoned during Brazil 's dictatorship , Rousseff 's inauguration will mark the official end of "" Era Lula "" .
"" I do n't think we managed to achieve everything that we wanted to , but I think we have done more than at any other moment in the history of this country , "" Lula , 65 , said this month during a rare meeting with foreign journalists .
"" We did n't solve all of Brazil 's problems but we made extraordinary steps .
"" Lula , the former union leader whose meteoric rise smashed the traditional mould for Brazilian political leaders , leaves behind a radically transformed nation : business is booming and the long - excluded poor are on the rise .
The past eight years have seen at least 20 million Brazilians lifted from poverty , thanks to Lula 's anti - hunger and income - transfer programmes .
Direct foreign investment has tripled to about $ 30bn ( £ 19bn ) a year since Lula took office in 2003 and many believe that by the time Rio de Janeiro hosts the 2016 Olympics , Brazil will be the world 's fifth - largest economy .
In September , Brazil 's state - controlled oil giant Petrobras was involved in a $ 70bn share offer – reputedly the largest in world history and another reminder of the country 's growing economic muscle . ""
Never before in the history of man have we had a capitalisation of this size , "" Lula boasted , deploying one of his most frequently used expressions .
Since Lula 's 2002 election , "" never before in history "" has become the president 's favourite – and in some quarters most ridiculed – catchphrase .
But few question the major changes Lula has overseen .
Tomorrow , he will leave power with astonishing approval ratings of close to 90 % .
Fernando Barros e Silva , a political columnist from the Folha de São Paulo journal , said the popularity of Lula 's government was "" above all down to an objective improvement in the lives of the poorest .
In spite of numerous problems in his government , including corruption , this is what Lula will be remembered for and rightly so . ""
Lula 's biographer and friend , the writer Denise Paraná , said : "" Lula 's silent revolution has increased the national wealth and distributed the excess to the poorest classes .
Lula has shown that a worker can be the boss , that an outsider can be president .
He has symbolically redefined Brazil 's class boundaries .
""
Gripes over how much personal credit Lula deserves for Brazil 's current boom persist .
Some describe the outgoing leader as the country 's luckiest ever president , pointing to how his time in power has coincided with a lucrative commodities boom and the discovery of massive offshore reserves of oil that could turn Brazil into a major crude oil producer . ""
Lula has gone down in Brazilian political history .
But he did not invent the wheel , nor did he start from zero , "" Marco Aurélio Nogueira , a politics professor from São Paulo 's state university , Unesp , wrote in a recent Lula retrospective . ""
He will not be missed as much as he or anyone else thinks .
"" In fact , with persistent speculation that Lula could seek re - election in 2014 or 2018 , he may hardly be missed at all . ""
For me , stopping doing politics would be the same as stopping to eat or to breathe , "" Lula wrote in his final weekly newspaper column as president this week .
"" The hypothesis of me abandoning politics does n't exist . ""
Paraná said she expected Lula to set up an NGO to fight hunger in the developing world and described the chance of a return to the presidency as "" very remote "" . ""
His plans go far beyond simply being president , "" she said .
"" Today Lula is a man of the world , a political personality with great international clout who is looking to wider projects to combat hunger and poverty . """
2011-01-13,"Brazil 's president , Dilma Rousseff , is due to visit a string of mountain towns devastated by floods and landslides , as the death toll from the disaster reached at least 361 .
Heavy rains on Tuesday night triggered some of the deadliest landslides in Brazilian history , sending mud sweeping through three towns and burying entire families as they slept .
In Teresópolis , a small town about 60 miles from Rio de Janeiro , 146 deaths have been confirmed , but local authorities expect that figure to rise .
In the neighbouring town of Nova Friburgo , at least 155 bodies have been recovered .
A Brazilian TV network claimed this morning that more than 419 people had died in Rio state and that as many as 1,000 people could still be missing . ""
This family no longer exists , "" read the headline of a Rio tabloid , alongside the photo of a prominent fashion designer and former Newsweek employee who was buried alongside eight relatives .
"" It 's a terrible scene , "" said a local judge , Jose Ricardo Ferreira de Aguiar , as he pulled back a black tarpaulin and stepped into Teresópolis 's improvised mortuary – the garage of the town 's police station .
On the concrete floor before him lay 100 bodies , among them newborn babies , toddlers , elderly women and teenagers .
Caked in brown mud and draped with pieces of soggy cardboard , the bodies were piled in a confusion of arms and legs .
Relatives were led into the morgue in groups of four to identify bodies splayed out under pieces of cardboard , sheets and muddy duvets .
Those that had already been identified had tatty paper ID tags tied on to their toes .
"" There 's no chance of even making this human , "" Aguiar said .
"" We 've just never seen anything like it here . ""
Mario Sergio Macario , 22 , a student who has been given the job of guarding the morgue 's entrance , said several colleagues from his tourism course were missing .
"" The station is chaos .
It 's a public calamity .
I 've never seen anything like it , "" he said .
About 1,000 people were left homeless as the waters smashed through Teresópolis , destroying homes , powerlines and roads .
The mayor , Jorge Mario Sedlacek , decreed a state of emergency , calling the calamity "" the worst to hit the town "" .
About 800 search - and - rescue workers from the state 's civil defence department and firefighters dug for survivors .
Marquinho Maia , a press officer who was helping out at the morgue , said last night : "" We pulled at least 16 bodies out this morning .
Kids , old people .
All dead .
It 's horrible .
The city has never had so many fatalities .
"" I 've lost several friends .
One of my friends still has n't found his mum or his wife .
Some areas have been completely destroyed . ""
Speaking after a helicopter flight over Teresópolis , Rio 's environment secretary , Carlos Minc , described the mudslides as the worst catastrophe in the region 's history .
"" I believe the death toll is much higher than has been so far announced , "" he said .
"" Many people died in their sleep .
The mountainsides are coming down .
The areas are very unstable . ""
Fernanda Carvalho , a 27-year - old maid from the region , told the G1 news website that the disaster had drawn no distinction between rich and poor . ""
The rich man 's house , the poor man 's house .
Everything was destroyed , "" she said .
Helicopter images showed at least two stranded people desperately waving white shirts in a bid to be rescued .
Nearby , a thick brown scar had been ripped through a residential area on the town 's outskirts , uprooting trees and demolishing everything in its path .
Two other tourist destinations in the same region , Petrópolis and Nova Friburgo , were badly affected , with 25 deaths reported there .
In Nova Friburgo , where at least 97 died after a month 's worth of rain fell in 24 hours , four firemen were reported to have been buried alive as they attempted to reach victims .
"" There are so many disappeared and so many that will probably never be found , "" said Angela Marina de Carvalho Silva , who believes she may have lost 15 relatives to the flood , including five nieces and nephews .
"" There was nothing we could do .
It was hell , "" she said in a telephone interview .
Carvalho Silva took refuge in a neighbour 's house on high ground with her husband and daughter , and watched the torrential rain carry away cars , tree branches and animals and tear apart the homes of friends and family .
"" It 's over .
There 's nothing .
The water came down and swept everything away , "" said her husband , Sidney Silva ."
2011-01-14,"The floods and landslides that have devastated part of the state of Rio de Janeiro also pose a huge challenge to the country 's newly - elected president , Dilma Rousseff .
The official death toll is already over 500 , but many are predicting the final total will be higher still .
This is clearly one of the worst natural disasters in Brazilian history .
Water and mud swept through the region , burying many families as they slept .
Thousands have been left homeless and roads and power - lines have been swept away , hampering the rescue effort and increasing the misery of survivors .
Dilma ( who is universally referred to by her first name ) has been quick to organise a tour of the affected area .
The government has also announced a $ 420 m rescue package to repair infrastructure and prevent future catastrophes .
Whether this will be considered an adequate response , however , remains to be seen .
I was due to visit my wife 's family , who live just north of the worst affected area , last week , but we cancelled our trip at the last minute due to the rain .
The rainy season is notorious for its mudslides and every year brings some type of event of this nature .
Brazilians have become wearily resigned to them â€ “ and cynical about their government 's response .
But the images that we have been watching show this current disaster to be of a far greater scale ; the televised scenes of the rescue efforts have brought the tragedy into everyone 's homes .
Makeshift morgues are piled high with corpses , many of them children and babies .
Graphic images of people scrambling to find bodies , or breaking down after identifying the corpse of a loved one have provoked a strongly emotional response throughout the country .
Many of the houses that were destroyed were self - constructed shacks , built on the edges of hillsides , often without permission .
These are often the first to be destroyed in such landslides .
The stratified nature of Brazilian society â€ “ still one of the most unequal countries in the world â€ “ has tended to compartmentalise the public and official concern .
But attitudes may be changing .
Media reports have stressed , slightly disingenuously , that the disaster drew no distinction between rich and poor .
They have also highlighted how the lack of affordable housing has forced people into vulnerable areas , bringing a new focus to bear on how the weaknesses of planning and state investment in infrastructure have clearly contributed to the scale of the disaster .
Dilma herself gave voice to this frustration , when she said , "" When there are n't housing policies , where are people who earn no more than twice the minimum wage going to live ? ""
The construction of affordable housing was a central part of Dilma 's recent election platform .
Handpicked by her predecessor , Luiz Ignacio Lula de Silva , Dilma has not yet stamped her personality on Brazilian politics â€ “ practically the only thing anyone knows about her is that she is a pragmatic technocrat , who can get things done .
Lula left office with sky - high popularity ratings , having presided over a long period of economic growth that had also seen the re - emergence of Brazil as a world power .
Although he failed to tackle some of Brazil 's most deepseated problems , living standards rose and social inequality did close slightly during his term in office .
Lula 's prestige and measure of success have raised public expectations about what can be expected from their government â€ “ and that , ironically , has increased the pressure on his chosen successor .
Dilma lacks Lula 's personal charisma , but she has a reputation as a tough , no - nonsense manager .
Since her election victory , she has stressed that her priorities will be maintaining economic stability , reducing poverty and improving education and healthcare .
Most Brazilians share these aims and she received an early political boost when the police successfully recaptured one of Rio de Janeiro 's most notorious favelas , in an operation she promises will be used as a model elsewhere .
Most observers accept that Dilmas has got off to a good start with her choice of ministers and early public pronouncements .
There is even hope that she will embark on some of the more fundamental reforms to the unwieldy Brazilian state , which Lula was unable to complete .
For now , though , she needs to show her crisis management skills : how she handles the disaster response will be a critical test of her credibility ."
2011-01-27,"Just days after Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was inaugurated on new year 's day , thousands of activists from the Landless Farmers Movement ( MST ) took over three expanses of land and various government buildings , demanding the new president speed up the rate of land redistribution to the country 's landless farmers . ""
At the beginning of this new political era in our country , our occupations are meant to publicly demand the carrying out of land reform , "" Joana Tavares , a spokeswoman for the MST , explained in a statement . ""
The old agrarian structures are still alive in our country , and with them the inequality , injustice and violence they perpetrate .
"" The MST began over 25 years ago , using direct action to occupy unused land and work it cooperatively for survival .
Operating under the slogan "" Occupy , Resist , Produce "" , the MST has taken over some 35 m acres , settling approximately 370,000 families .
In spite of these advances , roughly half of the usable land in the country remains in the hands of just 1 % of the population .
According to Brazilian law , the government can expropriate unused land and give it to the landless farmers .
This law has empowered landless farmers to occupy land , and then fight for legal recognition for their right to it .
Rousseff should heed the call of the MST , both in the area of land reform and in the development of sustainable agricultural policies .
Like her popular predecessor , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , who ran the country from 2003 - 2010 , Rousseff is planning on moving ahead with policies that embrace destructive , massive - scale agro - industry , genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) , deadly pesticides , and harmful logging and cattle ranching .
Such a direction will further concentrate land in the hands of a few wealthy people , and destroy the already fragile environment .
What the MST proposes , on the other hand , is a series of policies that would benefit the poorest sectors of the country and the land .
The MST 's demands and actions should serve as a guide to Rousseff as she develops her agrarian policies .
When the MST activists take over land , in most cases they develop cooperative farms and build houses , schools , and health clinics .
They manage the land collectively in a sustainable way , as well as educate the children and advance gender equality .
The MST actively fights against the use of GMOs and industrial farming , while also working within their own camps to grow healthy food on a small scale that generates employment for MST members .
The MST has succeeded in developing hundreds of farming cooperatives , one natural medicine factory , numerous health clinics and thousands of primary and secondary schools .
In an interview with the leftist Brazilian weekly Brasil de Fato , MST leader JoÃ£o Pedro StÃ © dile explained the benefits of his movement 's vision of land reform .
This vision includes respecting the environment , developing diversified , small - scale farming , getting rid of large estates , and breaking the stranglehold foreign corporations have over the countryside .
Putting the land into the hands of small farmers will have far reaching effects on the economy , StÃ © dile explained , in part because it will stem the exodus from the countryside into urban slums .
Keeping people in the countryside , he said , is "" fundamental to the reduction of unemployment in the cities
â€ ¦
Agrarian reform helps to resolve the problems of housing and overpopulation in the cities .
It will also rebalance the environment , and with that , we will have fewer of the climate changes that are now affecting the cities with more vigour . ""
Recent floods and landslides in Rio de Janeiro , for example , have killed hundreds and displaced thousands .
The land reform proposed by the MST will also cut down the pesticides being used so widely throughout the country by major agribusiness . ""
The grand domain of agribusiness can only produce with poisons [ harmful pesticides ] , because it does n't require manpower , and this poison reaches each of our stomachs , "" StÃ © dile said .
Deadly pesticides are used across the nation by agribusinesses , poisoning the air and drinking water , killing crops , and harming livestock .
The MST provides a viable model for Rousseff .
But in a radio interview before her election , she defended the continuation of Lula 's policies , "" What we are doing is doing away with the real basis for the instabilities of the landless .
They are losing reasons to fight . ""
Yet , with the MST 's recent occupations , and their pledge to continue with militant action , it appears the fight over Brazil 's land is far from over .
The MST will continue to build a better world on their own , one land occupation at a time , but Rousseff has an opportunity to break with the past by following the MST 's lead in developing agrarian policies .
If she ignores their example , the results will prove ruinous for the environment and the economy ."
2011-02-01,"Brazil 's new president , Dilma Rousseff , has never been popular among environmentalists .
Since the early days of predecessor Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva 's presidency , when she occupied the post of minister of mining and energy , many activists have seen her as a leader with an old - fashioned view of development .
Something like "" economic growth is priority number one , no matter if some hectares of Amazon rainforest has to be chopped down "" .
The animosity increased even more after Rousseff was promoted , in 2005 , to the ministry of internal affairs â€ “ the post that paved her way to the presidency .
With the second most important job in the republic , she was responsible for coordinating the government action plan , the Plano de AceleraÃ§Ã£o do Crescimento ( PAC ) â€ “ the "" plan of growth acceleration "" .
It was a period when almost every infrastructure project â€ “ from offshore oil drilling to roads in the middle of the forest â€ “ were given licences , despite civil society criticism .
Nevertheless , in her first day in the job , the new president gave an impression that something could have changed .
After being sworn as the 40th Brazilian president and the first woman to assume the post in the country , Rousseff told the crowd : "" Brazil has the holy mission to prove to the world that it is possible to have speedy growth without destroying the environment . ""
The speech was interpreted as a sign that the new administration would act on issues such as clean energy and deforestation .
But less than a month on from the inaugural speech , non - governmental organisations are saying they were no more than empty words : the new administration soon sacked the president of the country 's environmental agency ( Ibama ) and then authorised the construction of the controversial Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant .
First conceived by the military government in the 1980s , the dam will be located in the heart of the Xingu river , a place known for its unique coverage of rainforest and numerous indigenous tribes .
The licence obtained last week by Norte Energia SA â€ “ a consortium almost entirely funded by state money â€ “ allows 238 hectares of forest to be cut down in order to open roads and basic infrastructure for the workers .
And this is just the beginning ; when it starts operating , Belo Monte 's reservoir is expected to flood almost 60,000 hectares of land .
The problem is that Norte Energia has not yet figured out how to avoid all the indirect environmental impacts that the promise of jobs and wealth will bring to the region .
Some estimates claim 10,000 people are already moving into the Xingu area and up to 100,000 are expected to arrive in the next few years .
FelÃ­cio Pontes , a public attorney from the state of ParÃ ¡ , said the new licence could not , by law , be issued without a solution being found for the problems it will cause .
In other words , green light for construction can not legally happen without more hospitals , sanitation and security in the region .
Pontes and his team have already petitioned the federal court asking for the suspension of the licence .
But even if the law stops the project , Belo Monte seems to be a point of no return for Rousseff : the dam is supposed to be one of the biggest achievements of her government and it is considered , after all , clean energy .
Back in 2004 , when she was Lula 's minister of mining and energy , Rousseff represented Brazil at the World Renewable Energy Conference , called by the German government .
During negotiations , she announced that Brazil would block the consensus if big hydroelectric dams were not considered a form of clean energy .
The Germans , who had previously only wanted to put small - scale dams in the renewable category , ended up accepting the Brazilian demand .
At that time , I had the opportunity of interviewing the future president and I asked her why she was taking that combative posture .
"" We have to be watchful , because it seems to me that some countries are trying to push technology to the developing countries , "" she said .
Not surprisingly , in 2009 , when Rousseff was the head of Brazil 's delegation to the Copenhagen climate summit , she adopted a similar narrative , claiming the north was depriving the south of its right to develop .
However , like Lula , Rousseff 's performance on environmental issues will be mainly assessed by the Amazon deforestation rates .
Controlling deforestation means curbing the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil and , to the public , it is also a demonstration of a strong hand over the land tenure chaos that still reigns in the forest .
By toughening the police and drying financial credit for illegal loggers , Lula managed considerable advances , cutting two thirds of deforestation in less than six years .
The positive trend even allowed his government to offer an ambitious target within the UN climate change convention : an 80 % reduction of Amazon deforestation by 2020 compared with the average of the five previous years .
It seems very likely that the Brazil 's target will be reached .
Last year , the country announced the lowest deforestation rate to date â€ “ 650,000 hectares .
Nevertheless , it is Rousseff 's administration that will need to guarantee that destruction in the Amazon will not return and that it will drop by a further 300,000 hectares , as stated by the national target .
While Lula emphasised police tactics , Rousseff will have to deal with the pressures that are increasing within the national congress .
The group of congressman defending the interests of the agricultural sector â€ “ the bancada ruralista â€ “ is asking for changes in one of the most important environmental laws of the country , the forest code .
Join these pressures coming from the congress with the eagerness of the government to create large infrastructure in the Amazon and you understand the bitterness of the greens in Brazil .
The question is : will it really be possible for the new president to fulfil her pledge of making the country grow without destroying the environment ?
Gustavo Faleiros is the editor of Brazilian environmental news agency O Eco â€¢ This article was changed on 1 February to read 60,000 hectares"
2011-02-15,"I recently witnessed a conversation between someone working for the Brazilian federal government and an environmentalist ; both were Workers ' party ( PT ) supporters ( the ruling party of President Dilma Rousseff ) .
"" I 'm in favour of the construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant , "" the former said , "" but I concede it 's not a ' left versus right ' issue . ""
"" It is n't , "" the latter replied .
"" Or if it is , maybe the left is n't who you think . ""
The scene encapsulates a dimension that the Belo Monte issue could yet acquire : a watershed moment for a number of people who have supported the PT government so far ; the crossing of a line that would make them question their future allegiances .
This , however , is not yet the case ; and while the issue has been getting growing coverage abroad , its impact in Brazil has so far been somewhat dulled .
To understand why that is allows us to think through some of the deeper genealogies of the Latin American left , as well as some of the contradictions of its present predicament .
As soon as it appeared as a discourse in the 1930s and 1940s , "" national developmentalism "" became the middle ground for a very wide spectrum of political forces in the region .
One of the characteristics of the phenomenon of historical populism ( as opposed to the loose term of abuse the word has become today ) was precisely its capacity to ride on the back of contradictory interests ; its central operation consisted in making "" national development "" mean all things to all people .
The cycle of military governments in the region , inaugurated by the Brazilian coup of 1964 , can be understood as the moment when the contradictions became too intense for the middle to hold , and a decision was forced between leftwing ( radical reformism ) and rightwing ( conservative modernisation ) national development projects .
The recent rise of progressive governments in the region is , in one sense , a resumption of that moment â€ “ an opportunity , at a very different conjuncture , to partially recover the path then violently blocked .
That is certainly the case in generational terms : even as yesterday 's young revolutionaries , presidents like Brazil 's Dilma Rousseff and Uruguay 's Pepe Mujica , were formed politically by the developmentalist "" consensus "" .
It is symptomatic that Belo Monte was first idealised by the military regime , as part of its 1970s "" Big Brazil "" policy â€ “ a programme of state - sponsored development based on gigantic flagship projects such as the Transamazonian highway , a black hole of money and men , unfinished to this day . ""
Development "" here meant centralised planning and an ideal of absolute mastery over nature where the environment figured as an obstacle to growth . ""
National "" meant managing people and nature as so many variables to be manipulated in the name of the national interest .
But there was more .
The state 's capacity to bend things to its will was ultimately premised on the power to enforce this will at any cost .
The model tended to reinforce extreme concentrations of wealth , with spectacular riches going to a few economic groups while wages generally were kept down by force .
With the PT in power , though , Brazil has seen its first period of sustained economic growth since the 1970s .
Savvy foreign policy nous has made it a big international player , and there is widespread optimism that Brazil will finally make good on its longstanding promise to be a "" country of the future "" .
What is more , it has managed to do so while distributing wealth , and boasts remarkable records in poverty reduction and enhancing access to basic rights .
National development , then , is not only back up in the agenda , but this time , it seems to work .
You 'd therefore excuse PT members , government supporters and voters who feel they have never had it so good for thinking that , sad as the loss of 60,000 hectares of forest and the displacement of 40,000 people may be , building Belo Monte is a national necessity .
Now the country is growing , it can not stop .
And for it not to stop , it needs energy .
This energy must come from somewhere .
The interest of the many trumps that of the few ; rational pragmatism overrides romantic idealism .
The problem , many argue , is that it is the very rationality of the project that is questionable .
The installed capacity of 11GW , which would place it as the third largest hydroelectric plant in the world , will not be effective for most of the year ; on average , it will run at 39 % of that .
Private - sector analysts suggest its cost , currently estimated at BR20bn ( approximately $ 12bn ) , could go up by 50 % before completion .
This will essentially come from BNDES , a public bank , as the project is deemed too risky and unpredictable to invest in .
Still , the progressive developmentalist argument goes , to oppose the production of more energy is to oppose the economic progress of Brazil 's poor , which in turns fuels increased consumption .
Besides , Belo Monte means clean energy .
There are two problems with that .
The first is that hydropower is not as clean as thought .
Reservoirs have high emissions of CO2 and methane ( with a warming effect 25 times stronger than CO2 ) as a consequence of decaying matter underwater ; not to mention the dark irony of calling "" clean "" the impact on the area 's fauna , flora and people , especially indigenous people , both contacted and uncontacted .
( It does not help that , as far as variables to be manipulated in the national interest go , the rights of indigenous peoples rank very low in the Brazilian imaginary . )
The second is that the bulk of Belo Monte 's output seems destined not to supply consumers , but to power energy - intensive industries in the region , mostly mining and aluminium .
This means not only more future deforestation and displacement , but also a model of development that entrenches inequalities of wealth and reinforces the country 's position in the international market as an exporter of low added - value primary commodities .
These tensions have been there since the beginning of the Latin American "" Pink Tide "" : the social and political advances of the last decade have had primary exports as their economic condition .
This has meant both a return to the old dreams of centrally - planned rapid modernisation , and a compromise between increased state participation in the economy and big business , such as mining and agribusiness .
In Brazil , many now wonder if the emphasis on "" making it big "" , evidenced in large - scale projects such as Belo Monte or the BNDES policy of creating "" Brazilian worldbeaters "" ( large transnationals in fields such as mining and food ) might not be putting the country on a path that will , in the long run , undo the social achievements of the last decade .
Brazil 's stance in climate negotiations has often been highly commended , although that is arguably a case of looking good by comparison .
One of the tenets of its negotiating position has been the basic principle of climate justice that the heavier burden of emission reductions must fall on the shoulders of those countries with a historically higher emission record , thus allowing developing countries room to industrialise , develop infrastructure and grow â€ “ presumably ( or hopefully ) eradicating poverty in the process .
Opponents see the flagship status Belo Monte has acquired â€ “ including the way in which the government has ridden roughshod over environmental legislation and local consultations to make the project viable â€ “ as signalling a choice for a model of development that is both environmentally more aggressive and socially less fair .
They call , instead , for a more decentralised and diversified energetic and productive matrix , less in thrall to size for size 's sake .
( One argument is that more energy could be produced by making existing plants more efficient . )
Appropriating a much - vaunted element of the PT 's style of doing politics , some demand that participatory democracy be extended to this field as well , and call for a national conference on energy .
Given how much Latin America 's left has "" national development "" in its genes , and how it is untarnished by the failed rightwing experiments of the 1970s , these are difficult discussions to have , especially when the country seems faced with a unique window of opportunity .
Yet , contrary to how some have tried to reduce it , the watershed moment that Belo Monte could yet become does not pose a choice between development and no development .
Most opponents recognise the important achievements of the last decade , and nobody is arguing that Brazil should go back to being a land of permanently unfulfilled potential .
The question is what kind of "" big "" Brazil should become ."
2011-03-03,"For those familiar with Latin American politics , the notion that Muammar Gaddafi had fled to Venezuela seemed absurd .
Certainly , ChÃ¡vez and other leftwing Latin American leaders have seemed embarrassed and uncertain how to respond to the events unfolding in Libya .
But ChÃ¡vez has not given explicit support and it is an awkward moment for many governments .
In any case , Gaddafi has much better friends in Africa and had some good friends in London as well .
It was interesting to see British Foreign Secretary William Hague bring ChÃ¡vez briefly back to the centre of attention in Latin American politics .
Because , for better or worse , ChÃ¡vez is much less important in the region than he was a few years ago .
And there is a new figure on the scene , now in charge of half of South America 's population , who may be beginning to embody a new strategy for left - of - centre leaders in Latin America .
In her first months as president of Brazil , Dilma Rousseff , former guerrilla and chosen successor to the wildly popular Lula , has begun to carve out her own style .
She took a step back from her country 's friendship with the government of Iran , and has set out to rein in public spending , something she thinks necessary to keep the country 's economic boom going .
Her strategy seems to be to maintain pragmatic centrist policies and forge ahead with fast growth , content that it has raised several tens of millions of people out of poverty in the last few years .
For decades the leftwing strategy in Latin America , from Castro to the Sandinistas to Lula 's early presidential campaigns , was to create a radical and alternative project outside of global capitalism and the "" imperialist "" west .
With their economies booming and the US 's so clearly faltering , many in Latin America are finding they can beat the west at its own game â€ “ and then use their increased power and wealth to pursue their goals at home and abroad .
It 's an approach reminiscent of China ; and coincidentally , the boom in many countries comes largely from exporting commodities to China .
In 2005 , when ChÃ¡vez led the openly confrontational campaign to bury George W Bush 's Free Trade Agreement of the Americas â€ “ flanked by former Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona , no less â€ “ the world was a different place .
The credit bubble was still expanding in the rich countries , the US was confidently and openly aggressive internationally , and was pushing a trade agreement it seemed they had n't bothered to ask Latin Americans about first .
Now , the US economy is in the dumps , its politics is beset by internal squabbling , and its leadership has been forced to humbly accept the limits of American power .
Meanwhile , Latin American is rushing ahead â€ “ its economy is thought to have grown by about 6 % last year â€ “ and is increasingly confident on the global stage .
Latin leaders used to love to thumb their noses at the west : ChÃ¡vez called Bush "" the devil "" , Bolivia 's Evo Morales joked about being included in the "" Axis of Evil "" , and Lula famously said â€ “ to Gordon Brown 's face â€ “ that the financial crisis and subsequent international misery was caused by "" blue - eyed bankers "" .
I suspect we will see less of this from Dilma Rousseff , who can carry on quietly confident that everyone knows in whose favour the balance of power is tilting .
It 's not yet clear if she will continue in the tradition of maintaining international alliances that infuriate Washington , but her move on Iran suggests she may not .
Of course , Brazil 's current path has its limitations .
There is the risk of over - reliance on commodity exports and the death of industry .
And posting big increases in GDP , while useful , has not magically solved the often shocking levels of inequality and social exclusion in the country .
Many in the very different Spanish - speaking countries of Latin America , where no country has Brazil 's shot at being a global power , remain committed to a much more radical approach .
But no new solidly leftwing leaders are on the up at the moment , and there is certainly nothing of the kind on the horizon in Brazil .
Here , where most people are better - off than they were a few years ago , the attitude seems to be : "" If it ai n't broken , why fix it ? """
2011-03-08,"A teenage socialist guerrilla who withstood imprisonment and torture , Rousseff is the first female president of Brazil .
Aged 63 , she is said to be a tough , no - nonsense manager , who won power by promising economic stability , to reduce poverty and improve education and healthcare .
She also promised to improve the lot of women , saying in her inaugaration speech : "" I would like for fathers and mothers to look into their daughters ' eyes today and tell them : ' Yes , women can . '
""
She vowed that nine of her 37 ministers would be women â€ “ a record for Brazil .
( Although critics noted she not only ignored women 's issues during her election campaign , but that the twice - divorced grandmother also publicly reversed her position on the legal right to an abortion to placate the religious right and underwent several rounds of plastic surgery to gain her place . )
The daughter of a Bulgarian immigrant her childhood was affluent until the death of her father when she was just 14 when her life changed dramatically .
The family struggled financially and Rousseff became involved with socialist and workers groups - eventually joining Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard , which seized foreign diplomats for ransom and shot foreign torture experts sent to train the generals ' death squads ( although Rousseff says she never used any weapons herself . )
She was captured and tortured .
After her release she returned to University , had a daughter with her second husband and started working for the government , eventually becoming finance chief of Porto Alegre , the state capital .
In 2000 she threw her lot in with Lula and his Partido dos Trabalhadores , or Workers ' Party .
She is already facing a huge test - the recent floods which have killed hundreds and buried entire towns ."
2011-03-30,"Brazil is considering offering financial support to Portugal to help its former colonial power avoid being sucked even deeper into its debt crisis .
Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff said on Wednesday that her government was studying ways in which it could buy Portuguese government debt .
Another option would be to give Portugal a cash injection by buying back some of the Brazilian government debt it currently owns .
"" One of the possibilities is buying part of Portugal 's sovereign debt , "" Rousseff told the DiÃ¡rio EconÃ³mico newspaper .
"" We are also examining other alternatives such as early buyback of Brazilian bonds held by the Portuguese government . ""
Brazil broke away from Portugal in 1822 , but the countries enjoy close political and economic ties .
According to the International Monetary Fund , the Brazilian economy is now almost 10 times larger than that of Portugal .
Any lifeline from Brazil would be welcome for Portugal , whose debt costs have spiked to record highs this week .
Its credit rating was lowered to the brink of "" junk "" status on Tuesday and many City economists believe a rescue package is becoming inevitable . ""
With Portugal being one false step away from losing investment - grade status , it is only going to make it more difficult for them to fund themselves in the market and it is possible that this downgrade is the tipping point that leads to an EU bailout , "" said Gary Jenkins , head of fixed income research at Evolution Securities .
But Jenkins was not convinced that Rousseff 's suggestion , made during an official visit to Portugal , would actually result in financial support for the Lisbon government .
Uwe Parpart , Cantor Fitzgerald 's chief economist in Asia , agreed that Portugal was "" closer to having to go to Brussels , begging bowl in hand , and ask for a bailout "" .
On Tuesday , Rousseff 's predecessor as president , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , urged Portugal to resist a rescue package .
"" Whenever the IMF tried to take care of countries ' debts , it created more problems than solutions , "" he said .
The yield , or effective interest rate , on Portuguese two - year government bonds rose to about 7.6 % on Wednesday , closer to the 10-year bonds which broke through the 8 % barrier this week . ""
As the two - year yield jumps and catches up with the 10-year , Portugal is now priced to fail , "" Parpart said ."
2011-05-10,"Brazil 's President Dilma Rousseffhas launched an ambitious youth training scheme to remedy one of the economy 's biggest shortcomings : its lack of skilled labour .
The supply falls short of demand fuelled by growth , which was 7.5 % in 2010 .
Two - thirds of Brazilian employers have difficulty recruiting suitable staff .
The shortage is particularly acute in high - growth industries : building , boosted by an ambitious programme of social housing and infrastructure projects linked to the football World Cup in 2014 ; mining , encouraged by rising world prices ; and energy , powered by deepwater oil and gas .
Brazil trains less than 40,000 engineering graduates and architects a year , whereas industry and construction need 60,000 .
To make up for the lack of graduates , the state - owned oil company Petrobras reputedly has six times more personnel than its overseas competitors .
One temporary solution would be to take more well qualified foreigners , but public opinion opposes this option .
In an Economist Intelligence Unit study of the market openness of 30 countries Brazil placed 23rd : it has only 1 million legal immigrants ( 0.5 % of the population , compared with 2 % in Chile ) .
Last month Rousseff announced massive state funding for a nationwide technical training scheme to produce 3.5 million new workers by 2014 , including 500,000 this year .

2011-05-27,"Less than one year ago , the Brazilian government stood proudly on the world stage as a country that would not allow development to destroy its rainforests and announced the lowest rate of Amazon deforestation on record .
Brazil 's newly elected and first female president , Dilma Rousseff , promised to prevent any changes in law that would allow more deforestation or give amnesty to environmental criminals .
She vowed to uphold the previous government 's commitments to reducing deforestation by 80 % by 2020 .
Yet , only a few months later , the gloss has worn off and the promises look shaky .
Forest loss is climbing again and millions of hectares are on the chopping block .
According to the latest Brazilian governmental figures , deforestation in the Amazon has spiked over the last two months â€ “ an increase of more than 500 % compared with the same timeframe last year .
Due to clouds and rain , which prevented satellite monitoring , the state of Para that boasted the highest rates of forest loss in 2010 was largely not included in the analysis .
Therefore these figures may be just the tip of the deforestation iceberg .
The Brazilian environmental minister , Izabella Teixeira , announced a "" crisis team "" and mobilised the Environmental Protection Agency and additional police to tackle what she called an "" atypical "" trend .
However , the heart of the crisis beats in Brasilia .
Brazil is considering major changes to the forest code â€ “ the main law that protects the rainforest .
If these changes go though they could let hundreds of forest criminals off the hook , and massively expand the amount of forest under threat from the chainsaws .
The changes would threaten the obligation for landowners to leave 80 % of their property forested and would grant impunity for those that have previously illegally deforested .
This is the fuel that is driving the substantial increase in deforestation .
Farmers are rushing to cut down forests , expecting that the new law will protect them from being punished for their past crimes .
They 're also gambling that the new rules will allow them to cut down more forest in the future , and they 're getting started before the ink is even dry .
The deaths earlier this week of leading rainforest defenders JosÃ ©
ClÃ¡udio Ribeiro da Silva and his wife ,
Maria do EspÃ­rito Santo was a tragic reminder of what can happen when impunity is legitimised .
The vote on changes to the code in the Congress this week and the subsequent Senate vote are strongly influenced by sections of the agribusiness lobby .
Yet soya export giants identify forest protection as a key part of their ability to capture international markets .
The Brazilian scientific community and 10 former Brazilian environment ministers point to such changes driving considerable biodiversity loss and climate impacts , and encourage the use of millions of hectares of under - utilised and degraded lands as a clear solution to the need to increase food production .
The spotlight rests on president Rousseff .
If she allows the forest code to change , she will capitulate to a small , yet vocal , vested interest group and will break the very promises which ensured her presidency .
The Brazilian success story of the 21st century could be undone on the eve of Brazil hosting the world at the Earth Summit ( Rio+20 ) in 2012 .
Brazil 's global reputation in the fight against deforestation and climate change is at stake .
President Rousseff must stop the chainsaws by keeping the current forest laws intact and getting tough with those who are clearing the rainforest right now .

2011-06-07,"President Dilma Rousseff has launched an ambitious plan , Brazil Without Misery , which aims to eradicate dire poverty by 2014 .
Just over 16 million Brazilians â€ “ almost a tenth of the population â€ “ live in extreme poverty , with less than $ 45 a month .
Half of them are under 19 , 40 % under 14 .
Almost two - thirds live in the Nordeste region and about one in five is illiterate .
Of the 30 million living in the countryside , one in four is "" very poor "" .
During the election campaign , Rousseff promised to end poverty .
Announcing the plan , she said it would be her top priority in her term of office .
"" We ca n't forget that the most permanent , challenging and harrowing crisis is having chronic poverty in this country , "" Rousseff said .
The government plans to launch an offensive through welfare payments , education , jobs , healthcare , access to public services , improved infrastructure and rural development .
First , the government will be giving slightly more money to the poorest people , broadening the scope of the bolsa familia ( conditional cash transfer ) initiated by Rousseff 's predecessor , Lula da Silva , which benefits 12 million poor or very poor families .
Now up to five children per family â€ “ formerly
it was three â€ “ qualify for benefits , embracing a further 1.3 million children .
Monthly payments to the mother of each family will range from $ 22 to $ 200 .
Above all , by the end of 2013 the government wants bolsa payments to reach 800,000 more families , who qualify for the welfare payments but do not receive it due to geographical isolation , poor information or administrative shortcomings .
"" We need to change the mindset that it is up to a poor person to come to the state , and ensure that the state reaches out to the poor person , "" social development minister Tereza Campello said .
Officials had to change their approach , identify needy families , go to homes and take action .
Since its launch in 2003 the bolsa familia scheme has enabled tens of millions of Brazilians to get enough to eat , live a little better , and even discover the joys of consumption and credit .
But more needed to be done , she said .
"" A country that has grown like Brazil ca n't be content with just having a big social programme , "" Campello emphasised .
In the second part of its plan , the government aims to improve access to public services , particularly education , the health service , running water , electricity and sewerage for those most in need .
Almost half of very poor rural families have neither running water nor a well , and more than half of them have neither a sewer connection nor a septic tank . ""
Productive inclusiveness "" , the third and last part of the scheme , aims to give the poor the economic means to lift themselves permanently out of poverty , through job opportunities , vocational training and micro - credit .
Brazil lacks the necessary labour for low - qualification jobs , so between now and 2014 some 1.7 million urban workers will be offered training .
Another goal is a fourfold increase in the number of poor farmers receiving state subsidies and guidance from farm engineers .
"" We want to eradicate extreme poverty by 2014 and make Brazil the first developing country to achieve the first of the UN millennium development goals , "" Campello said .

2011-11-02,"When Brazil 's president Dilma Rousseff arrives on the CÃ´te d'Azur , she will bring harsh words for her European counterparts .
As the European debt crisis has dragged on , and concerns over the possible impacts on Brazil and other emerging economies have grown , Rousseff and her finance minister , Guido Mantega , have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of the European response . ""
The Europeans always take too long to find solutions , "" Mantega grumbled earlier this month . ""
And when they come they come late . ""
David Fleischer , a political scientist from the University of Brasilia , said the Brazilian delegation would not mince their words during the G20 meeting .
"" The Brazilian message will be : ' You have to get your game together and make some decisions , ' "" he said .
"" It 's a pretty harsh line but the Europeans know they have to decide something . ""
Brazilian authorities insist they are well prepared for the consequences of an extended and deepening crisis in Europe , but growing fears of "" contagion "" have made policy makers around the developing world edgy , even in booming Brazil .
"" There is concern about contagion , "" Fleischer said .
"" European firms have been pulling their money out of Brazil and taking it home
â€ ¦
The whole economy is slowing down . ""
Last year Brazil 's economy grew 7.5 % , its highest rate in nearly 25 years , but in August the projected growth rate for 2011 was cut to around 3.8 % amid signs that China 's economy was slowing .
Brazil 's main fear is that the European debt crisis might yet deepen into a full - blown financial crisis that would send waves through the global economy , affecting China and in turn damaging the economies of emerging countries such as Brazil , which is heavily dependent on the Asian colossus to buy its iron ore and other commodities .
Recent reports of a fall in China 's trade surplus did little to allay such concerns .
"" There is the worry that the crisis will hit China , because China depends on global demand .
If global demand falls below a certain level then the country will not have a way of exporting its products , "" Mantega admitted last week in Paris on the eve of the G20 meeting .
"" A reduction in China 's growth will end up affecting the emerging [ economies ] which today are still relatively shielded from the Euro - American crisis . "" "" The emerging economies , which are more dynamic , have not so far been affected .
But if the crisis deepens it will also impact on the emerging [ economies ] and we will suffer the consequences , "" Mantega said .
AntÃ´nio Carlos Lessa , an international relations professor from the University of Brasilia , said concern over "" contagion "" meant the Brazilians were likely to arrive in Cannes with all guns blazing .
Rousseff , he believed , was likely to "" provoke "" and "" preach "" to the rich nations â€ “ particularly the European powers and to a lesser extent the US .
Rousseff would point out that Brazil had learned from past financial crises and that "" rich countries should now do their homework "" to stop their crisis contaminating other emerging economies , he said .
Lessa added , however , that such "" provocations "" were unlikely to help solve the current crisis .
"" It is one thing to say these things
â€
¦
But in a crisis of this complexity it is not Brazil provoking or condemning that is going to change things .
"" The crisis is like a burst dam .
First we need to stop the leak .
Then we can find a way to rebuild it . ""
Whether Brazil is able to influence the outcome of the Cannes talks or not , Lessa said Brazil 's leadership in uniting leaders from a variety of emerging economies towards a common position was a positive sign of the country 's growing clout and reach on the global stage .
"" For the first time Brazil has made a strong effort to coordinate positions [ between emerging economies ] , "" Lessa said , pointing to a recent Ibsa ( India , Brazil and South Africa ) summit in Pretoria at which a common position for the G20 summit was negotiated , and in talks with Mexico and Argentina . ""
Brazil now sees itself in a position to express these concerns , "" on behalf of other emerging nations , he said .
"" Brazil will confirm its position as a mediator between rich and poor countries . """
2011-11-18,"David Cameron risks international isolation by focusing on austerity measures at the expense of jobs growth , the leader of the TUC has warned , as unions prepare to meet next week to approve mass public sector strikes on 30 November .
Brendan Barber , the TUC general secretary , said the "" L20 "" group of trade union leaders who attended the G20 summit in Cannes received positive responses from Barack Obama and others when they urged governments to emphasise employment over spending cuts .
Barber said the US president 's views were echoed by his Brazilian counterpart , Dilma Rousseff , and the Australian prime minister , Julia Gillard , but Cameron had made clear in a meeting with the L20 that deficit reduction is the UK 's priority . ""
Barack Obama certainly acknowledged that he thought the emphasis needed to come back to promoting jobs and growth rather than austerity , "" Barber said .
"" Some of the other leaders too , like Gillard and Dilma . ""
Support was also forthcoming from the leaders of Japan , Argentina and France , Barber said , adding that the meetings reflected a "" broader battle between austerity and growth "" .
In an interview with the Guardian , Barber said he expected trade unions to confirm plans to strike on 30 November in the biggest display of industrial discontent since the 1970s .
The NASUWT teaching union became the latest organisation to back walkouts over pension reforms on Friday , joining a broad coalition of public sector workers from nurses to binmen and probation officers .
"" What we have seen is big votes across the unions to support strike action and that , I think , is what the unions will be deciding on , "" said Barber , who will attend a meeting of union bosses on Tuesday .
About 2.6 million people have been balloted , with an estimated 700,000 voting for strikes .
Barber said discussions were ongoing , as individual negotiations on the four pension schemes â€ “ for health , civil service , education and local government workers â€ “ thrash out the implications of recent government concessions .
"" We will be continuing in negotiations to try to see if we can resolve it .
But at the moment it does look like [ 30 November ] will be going ahead . ""
Barber said he was "" very surprised "" at a proposal from Francis Maude , the Cabinet Office minister , that if union members strike for just 15 minutes at the end of the month they will not be docked a day 's pay .
If Maude was serious about the offer it would have been tabled at talks , Barber added .
The day of protest will not have a focal point , unlike the March for the Alternative this year that saw 250,000 protesters take to the streets of London .
Instead , there will be walkouts accompanied by regional rallies and workplace events , including the leafleting of hospitals . ""
The intention has always been to have activities around the country rather than have people at one central event , "" said Barber .
"" Some events will involve marches and rallies , some will be workplace - based events where there will be an emphasis on getting our message across to the wider public .
There will be huge efforts with leafleting , for instance making sure that people coming to hospitals will hear about issues related to the dispute . ""
He added : "" There will be an attempt not just to bring public service workers together but to engage positively and openly with the wider public as well . ""
Vital services would not be left unstaffed , he said .
"" All the unions have made it clear that they will be looking to ensure that arrangements are made to protect public safety .
That has long been the TUC 's policy . ""
Barber said there was "" some way to go "" before time runs out to strike a deal on pensions , with the government seeking an agreement by the end of the year .
The government has made clear that the 30 November strikes will not lead to the withdrawal of concessions tabled this month , including raising the accrual rate â€ “ a measure of the rate at which pensions grow â€ “ and pledging that anyone within 10 years of retirement from 1 April next year will not see a reduction in their pension pot .
Barber warned Cameron against being "" relaxed "" about the impact of the strikes on talks and public opinion .
"" I do n't think they should be relaxed , because it will reflect a huge degree of disaffection among millions of public service workers . ""
The concessions offered by Maude and Danny Alexander , the chief secretary to the Treasury , are being considered in sector - level negotiations over reforms to pensions for health , civil service , education and local government workers .
"" There is still a lot of detail to be worked through so these negotiations are continuing , but with a lot of frustration that despite the public fanfare around things that the government put to us there is still a lack of clarity in a number of areas about exactly what is being proposed , "" said Barber .
Barber acknowledged that there would be disruption at schools , hospitals , job centres and airports on 30 November , but he said the strikes were necessary to convey the "" strength of feeling "" among public sector workers over pension reform .
"" We will be trying to make sure that people understand the strength of feeling that has given rise to the action .
I do n't think anyone takes any pleasure in seeing ordinary people having their lives disrupted .
But I would say that the number of working days lost to strikes in Britain are at historic lows .
Many of the organisations have not been involved in strike action for decades , in some cases never before .
"" It is a reflection of the frustration that they feel , that they are now pushed to this action .
Nobody has done this casually or lightly and nobody takes any pleasure in the disruption that it causes for other members of the community . ""
The TUC leader also warned Maude against taking "" too much comfort "" from turnouts of around 30 % in ballots involving the "" big three "" unions of the GMB , Unite and Unison , which saw around 1.5 million members polled .
"" A voting profile of about four to one [ in favour ] seems to have been pretty steady across the unions .
If there is an argument that these do not reflect a broad - based feeling among those organisations , I just think that argument looks utterly hollow .
They are powerful mandates . ""
Even if the concessions are accepted and worked into new pension schemes for all four groups , there are still significant barriers to a deal .
The distance between both sides is underlined by the lack of movement on other issues such as switching the uprating of pensions from the higher RPI rate of inflation to the lower CPI rate , and a rise in employee contributions that is seen as an arbitrary tax on public sector workers .
""
On a number of issues they have not been prepared to move on such as CPI and the contributions increases , which is seen as a tax on the public service workforce not justified by considerations of the long - term sustainability of public sector pensions . ""
Barber said that there is a "" real fear "" of schemes such as the Local Government Pension Scheme becoming unsustainable as , instead of shouldering a rise in contributions , members drop out .
He added that he did not want the pensions dispute to be dragged into a wider political debate over the state of the economy , the Occupy protests and growing unemployment .
"" This is a dispute about a particular issue , about pensions .
I would not want this dispute to be misrepresented with some broader political perspective . ""
However , he admitted concern over youth unemployment rising above one million people and a warning this week from the Bank of England that the economy might grow by just 1 % next year .
"" I am concerned about the wider economic position which is parlous in the extreme , with the economy flatlining .
The prospects for growth are looking very dismal and as a consequence the possibility of a real recovery getting people back to work is still looking a long way away .
And the government is still sticking to plan A.
"" He added : "" I am concerned that of course there are potentially very damaging social consequences and fears of a lost generation of young people feeling increasingly locked out of the world of work and increasingly disenchanted with society . """
2011-12-02,"She came to power vowing to blaze a trail for women 's rights and now , nearly a year after being elected Brazil 's first female president , Dilma Rousseff may be achieving just that .
A wave of women are preparing to stand for office in her home state of Minas Gerais , where Reginaldo Lopes , the local leader of Rousseff 's Workers ' party ( PT ) , said the party would field a record number of female candidates in 2012 .
"" The PT is going to explode , it will be all about the women , "" Lopes said , outlining the party 's plans to field female candidates in several of Minas Gerais ' largest cities , among them Governador Valadares and Juiz de Fora .
At least 100 female candidates are planning to stand in mayoral elections next year , according to the state 's leading newspaper , Estado de Minas .
The newspaper , based in the state capital of Belo Horizonte , where Rousseff was born and raised , claimed the candidates hoped to take advantage of what electioneers and journalists have dubbed "" the Dilma effect "" . ""
Lipstick , well - groomed hair , precisely chosen clothes
â€ “ matching with the shoes ,
of course â€ “ may all became indispensable items in next year 's elections , "" the paper said in a somewhat patronising front - page story this week .
"" Is it women 's turn ? "" it wondered .
A career civil servant and former leftwing guerrilla , Rousseff came to office in January , exactly 60 years after the election of Brazil 's first female MP .
She became the eighth elected female president in Latin America and the Caribbean , and in her first address to the nation promised to battle for women 's rights so that electing female leaders became "" a natural event "" .
"" I would like fathers and mothers to look into their daughters ' eyes today and tell them : ' Yes , women can , ' "" Rousseff said in her inaugural address .
Despite the initial jubilation at her historic election there were concerns , even within her own party , that Rousseff would struggle to replicate the successes of her predecessor and mentor , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
Lula , widely considered the most popular president in Brazilian history and famously dubbed "" my man "" by his US counterpart Barack Obama because of his standing with his country 's electorate , left office with approval ratings of more than 80 % .
Almost a year after taking the reins Rousseff is , however , faring well .
The latest polls , conducted in September , gave her a personal approval rating of 71 % .
Analysts say voters have responded particuarly well to the president 's well - publicised attempts to tackle corruption â€ “ labelled faxina or house - cleaning .
So far five ministers have been ejected from their jobs after allegations of graft .
Other high - profile heads are expected to roll in the coming months .
"" At first people had their doubts , but today Dilma has won the people over , "" said Lopes , who believes that Rousseff 's current popularity is likely to help boost support for other female candidates .
The PT is not the only Brazilian party looking to cash in on the "" Dilma effect "" in Minas Gerais .
Its main rival , the Brazilian Social Democratic party or PSDB , also sees an opening for a greater number of female candidates .
The PSDB is reportedly considering 39 women for its electoral lists .
"" We believe that there is now a greater stimulus for women to take part in the elections with the expectation of winning , "" Lenita Norman , the PSDB 's regional head told Estado de Minas .
"" We have a female president in a world where this is a rarity and that shows that Brazil is leading the way . ""
Maria Imaculada Dutra , a Socialist councillor in the town of Manhuacu who is hoping to run for mayor , said courage , rather than Rousseff , would be her greatest asset in the 2012 election race .
"" It 's not Dilma running a good government that motivates me .
I 'm tired of corruption in this town and you need courage to face up to the corrupt , "" she said ."

She has now been invited to the Brazilian state of Bahia in February for the screening of a documentary about press freedom in Cuba and Honduras in which she features .
But speaking to the Brazilian television channel Record this week , SÃ¡nchez said she expected her latest request for an exit permit would again be declined without "" high - level intervention "" .
SÃ¡nchez told Record she had "" exhausted all of the options inside my country to get them to allow me to travel "" .
In the video appeal to Rousseff , posted on YouTube , SÃ¡nchez called on Brazil 's first female president to intervene . ""
Please help me , "" said the blogger , who says it is her 19th attempt to get travel permission from Cuban authorities .
"" Through this small video I want to send a very respectful [ and ] very humble message â€ ¦ to the president of Brazil , Dilma Rousseff . ""
"" Unfortunately I am forbidden from leaving my own country
â€ “ I have not committed any crime . ""
Referring to the time Rousseff spent in jail during Brazil 's military dictatorship , SÃ¡nchez said : "" I know very well that she has felt first hand â€ ¦ what excessive control and repression is . ""
"" I have done everything that is within my reach but the wall of control , the wall of censorship , the wall which stops me travelling freely and returning to my island seems not to move , "" said SÃ¡nchez , whose supporters have also created an online petition calling on Rousseff to intervene .
Before Christmas , activists had hoped that Cuba 's president , RaÃºl Castro , would announce major changes to the country 's migration laws , particularly the rule that means Cubans require exit permits to travel abroad .
But while Castro , who officially took over from his brother as president in 2008 , announced pardons for nearly 3,000 prisoners , those hoping for a loosening of travel rules were disappointed .
"" The migration reforms â€ ¦ were not announced again , "" SÃ¡nchez says in her video appeal to Rousseff . ""
In the 21st century â€
¦ we are forbidden from leaving and entering freely our country .
"" SÃ¡nchez has earned international plaudits for her blog , GeneraciÃ³n Y , on which she publishes regular critiques of the Cuban authorities , often secretively posted from internet cafes .
In 2008 , Time magazine named her one of the world 's 100 most influential people .
The magazine 's profile , written by the American novelist Oscar Hijuelos , described her "" feisty dedication to the truth "" . ""
Under the nose of a regime that has never tolerated dissent , SÃ¡nchez has practiced what paper - bound journalists in her country can not : freedom of speech , "" Hijuelos wrote .
But while the blogger 's supporters view her as a standard - bearer for press freedom , Cuban authorities have accused her of conducting a Washington - backed "" cyberwar "" against the island 's communist regime .
In a recent piece for Foreign Policy magazine , the Cuban blogger said that while many foreign correspondents in Havana feared expulsion if they offended authorities , social networks were helping independent journalists get the message out .
"" Opening the world 's eyes to the real Cuba â€ ¦ no longer requires a wire service dispatch ; it can be done with a cell phone , "" she wrote .
Meanwhile , Cuban authorities have vented their anger at a Twitter user whom they accused of starting a wave of online rumours this week claiming that the former president , Fidel Castro , had died .
An article posted on the state - run Cubadebate website pointed the finger of blame at a tweeter called @Naroh .
In the story , entitled : "" New lie against # FidelCastro fails on Twitter "" , the website claimed that after the rumours began "" necrophiliac counterrevolutionaries , aided by some media , immediately started to party . ""
Responding to the allegations that he had started the hoax , Naroh tweeted : "" Cuba is blaming me for killing Fidel Castro on Twitter .
Can I now consider myself a Twit - star ? """
2012-01-26,"The Brazilian government has granted a tourist visa to the dissident Cuban blogger Yoani SÃ¡nchez , adding pressure on Havana to allow her to leave the island .
The move comes days before Brazil 's president , Dilma Rousseff , visits Cuba , where she is expected to meet the country 's former leader Fidel Castro , and its current president , RaÃºl Castro .
"" I now have a visa to [ visit ] Brazil , "" SÃ¡nchez wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday , posting a photo of the 30-day visa . ""
Now the most difficult part â€ “ the exit permit .
""
SÃ¡nchez , who has been described as "" an enemy of the Cuban revolution "" , has been unable to leave her homeland since 2004 because of rules that mean Cubans need government authorisation to travel .
Earlier this month the blogger launched an online appeal to Rousseff to allow her to travel to the Brazilian state of Bahia to attend the premiere of a documentary about her life . ""
Please help me , "" she said .
"" Unfortunately I am forbidden from leaving my own country . ""
While Rousseff is not expected to make any major policy changes towards Cuba during her trip , analysts said the move suggested she was taking a more sympathetic stance towards its dissidents than her predecessor , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva .
In 2010 Lula came under fire after belittling the plight of political prisoners on hunger strike in Cuba . ""
Imagine if all the criminals in Sao Paulo went on hunger strike to demand freedom , "" Lula told the Associated Press .
Following her 2010 election , Rousseff signalled she would place greater emphasis on human rights when formulating foreign policy .
"" I have an historical commitment to all those that were or are prisoners just because they expressed their views , their public opinion , their own opinions , "" Rousseff , a former guerrilla who was tortured by Brazil 's military dictatorship , told the Washington Post in her first interview with the international media .
Recent weeks have seen Rousseff win praise for distancing her administration from the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , with whom Lula cultivated friendly ties .
Brazil was notably absent from Ahmadinejad 's itinerary during his Latin American tour earlier this month , triggering a fierce reaction from Tehran .
Ali Akbar Javanfekr , a key government spokesman in Tehran , this week told the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper that Rousseff had destroyed years of good relations between the two countries . ""
The president has struck down everything Lula had achieved , "" Javanfekr said .
One senior western diplomat told the Guardian that Ahmadinejad 's failure to visit Brazil was encouraging .
"" We noticed that , "" the diplomat said with a smile ."
2012-04-11,"The second most powerful person in the western hemisphere arrived in Washington on Monday .
But the most powerful one spent most of the day rolling Easter eggs on the South Lawn .
Dilma Rousseff , the Brazilian president , leads an economy larger than Britain 's , commands an ocean 's worth of oil , and enjoys a 77 % approval rating her American counterpart can only fantasise about .
Everybody but Barack Obama wanted to see her this week .
She arrived to the accompaniment of a half - dozen op - eds from professors and thinktank bosses , all of them extolling her economic stewardship and begging DC to take her seriously .
The presidents of Harvard and MIT ( both women , for what it 's worth ) invited her up to Boston .
Even the US chamber of commerce put out the bunting â€ “ surely the first time the big bad business group has been so excited to meet a former Marxist guerrilla .
Only Obama shrugged .
The two presidents had a short meeting and a shorter press bilateral , during which they never looked each other in the eye .
About the only boost to bilateral ties that came out of their confab was a deal to promote the importation of cachaÃ§a â€ “ wonderful news for caipirinha drinkers , sure , but not exactly an agreement of world - historical importance .
Not only did the US president not bother with the trappings of a state visit ; he barely gave Dilma two hours .
"" Obama could have taken her to dinner , "" one Brazilian official groused .
"" Or to the Kennedy Center . ""
The leaders of India and China get pomp and circumstance when they come to town .
Vladimir Putin is a big enough operator that Sarah Palin blessedly keeps watch on his nation from her house .
But Brazil is the Brics country that gets no respect , even in 2012 .
We still speak of it as a basket case , which would be patronising even if our own country were n't in the grips of a rejectionist Congress and a politically motivated supreme court .
Yet of all the big emerging economies â€ “ a ridiculous phrase now that they have already emerged , while our own and Europe 's seem to be receding into nothingness â€ “ Brazil is the one that poses the least significant geopolitical threat and offers the most advantages , as all those salivating CEOs already know .
So why did Obama , who has already demonstrated his prowess as a salsa dancer , decline to put a little samba in his step as well ?
It 's tempting to imagine that , in an election year , the White House was reluctant to spotlight a much more successful economy than our own , where massive growth and reduced inequality go hand in hand .
But I 'm afraid the real reason is simpler : with respect to the boardroom optimists advocating some grand inter - American compact , this is just how Washington does business .
In history class , the first lesson students learn about American foreign policy is the Monroe Doctrine â€ “ the 200-year - old principle that Latin America is our turf .
We do what we like and tell everyone else to keep out .
The idea that a Latin American country could actually serve as a model is beyond our comprehension .
Now , for the first time , a second major power is rising on the block , but among us gringos the old big - stick habits die hard .
More and more , alas , the US looks like it is conducting a Norma Desmond foreign policy : hallucinating that it has n't aged and withered , unable to accept that the world is changing and that its powers are in decline .
Voters seem to know full well that the days of uncontested American supremacy have come and gone , which makes it all the more pitiful that our government still ca n't accept the altered state of things .
That stood out particularly this week , and on the substance of Dilma 's visit as much as the optics .
One goal that almost everyone agrees on is an end to requiring visas for visiting Brazilians â€ “ though on the evidence of the throngs of lusophones I saw descend on a Miami shopping mall last month , that 's not enough to keep them away .
( Brazilians spend the most tourist dollars per capita in the US , splashing out $ 5,000 a visitor . )
Yet the White House announced on Monday that the visa rules are staying in place , and tried to celebrate that it takes "" only "" 35 days to get a sticker in your passport from the SÃ£o Paulo consulate .
A bill has been proposed to relax the rules .
It is stuck in the Senate .
The fear , naturally , is illegal immigration .
Which shows just how behind the times the US remains : as if any Brazilian these days would come to America for a job .

2012-04-19,"Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has been travelling the world in recent weeks to tell industrialised nations to stop the "" tsunami "" of speculative capital flowing into her country .
Low interest rates and slow growth in the global north , when coupled with relatively high interest rates and fast growth in the global south , creates the environment for investors to pull money from rich countries and to speculate on the south .
This has caused the value of developing - country currencies to appreciate â€ “ making it harder for companies and farmers to export , and thus causing job losses and a general lack of competitiveness .
Speculative capital flows are also raising the price of stock , bond and real - estate markets
â€ “ threatening to create bubbles such as the one experienced in the US in 2008 .
Rouseff 's government has started regulating cross - border finance , and so should industrialised nations .
Brazil 's currency appreciated by more than 40 % between 2009 and 2011 â€ “ so much so that there are amplified concerns about "" de - industrialisation "" .
Their exports are becoming so expensive that the country 's manufacturing base is seriously under threat .
Over the past three years , Brazil has taxed stocks , bonds and derivatives purchases from abroad .
Many other emerging market and developing countries , such as South Korea , Indonesia , Taiwan and Peru have also been regulating the inflows of speculative capital over the past few years .
But they are struggling .
A lack of north - south co - operation , and a web of trade and investment treaties , make it more difficult for some southern nations to regulate and for many northern countries to co - operate .
The IMF Articles of Agreement grant nations the leeway to regulate cross - border capital flows and also enable north - south co - operation to stem the tide .
The lack of co - operation on the part of the global north is ironic , given that low interest rates in the developed world are in place to try to spur growth and employment within them .
Unfortunately , investors choose to borrow at low interest rates and speculate in developing countries .
Thus the countries that need the investment for recovery do not receive it and the countries that are close to overheating receive too much .
Some nations that probably should be deploying regulations on capital flows are not because they violate recent trade and investment treaties .
Brazil has repeatedly put in place taxes and other measure on capital inflows ; neighbouring nations such as Chile and Colombia have not â€ “ in part because Chile and Colombia have trade treaties with the US that require all capital flowing between borders moves "" freely and without delay "" .
Brazil does not have a treaty with the US .
A new high - level taskforce , that I co - chair with JosÃ © Antonio Ocampo and Stephany Griffith - Jones , argues that regulating cross - border finance is justified now more than ever .
As IMF leaders gather in Washington this week they should reiterate that individual nations have the right to regulate unstable capital flows ; that industrialised countries such as the US have to share some of the responsibility and co - operate on the other end of those regulations .
Moreover , the IMF should address the extent to which numerous trade and investment treaties violate the IMF Articles of Agreement .
As nations attempt to recover from this crisis and prevent the next one , they need all the leeway and co - operation they can harness ."
2012-05-11,"More than 1.5 million people in Europe , the US and elsewhere have petitioned the Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , to veto a law that critics say could lead to the loss of 220,000 square kilometres of Amazonian rainforest , an area close to the combined size of the UK and France .
The proposed new Brazilian forest code , pushed through parliament by the powerful farming lobby in the face of national opposition , would provide an amnesty for landowners who have illegally cleared forests in the past and will allow deforestation in previously protected areas like mountain tops and beside rivers .
According to environment groups , it could allow loggers to chop down more of the Amazon than has been possible in the last 50 years .
The president , who has the right to veto the bill , has been bombarded with emails , petitions and by social media appeals by more than 1.5 million people .
This number is expected to rise dramatically in the next few days as Greenpeace , Avaaz and WWF International ask their 22 million supporters to sign up .
"" Nearly 80 % of Brazilians want this catastrophic bill scrapped , and so far over 1 million people across the world support them .
President Rousseff has a choice â€ “ sign the Amazon 's death sentence or protect the planet 's lungs and emerge a public hero , "" said Ricken Patel , Avaaz director .
"" President Dilma Rousseff stands at a defining moment for her presidency , "" said Kumi Naidoo , Greenpeace International director .
"" The choice is clear .
She can ignore the Brazilian people and side with ' destruction as usual ' as enshrined in the new forest code or exercise her veto and support the call for a new zero deforestation law .
We urge her to take the visionary path of a leader who understands that with power comes responsibility . ""
The groups hope that Rousseff , who has until 25 May to exercise her veto , will bow to international pressure to avoid embarrassment when she plays host to the UN 's Rio + 20 Earth summit next month .
More than 125 heads of state as well as 45,000 delegates are expected to attend the world 's largest environment conference in a generation , pledging to protect forests and develop the "" green economy "" .
The new forest code allows landowners to count woodland on river margins , hilltops and steep inclines towards a total proportion of forest that must be legally preserved on their land .
It also allows for reserve areas in the Amazon to be reduced from 80 % to 50 % , as long as the state where the reduction is planned maintains 65 % of protected areas .
Landowners , who are growing in political importance as Brazil becomes a major exporter of commodity crops , said they were confident that the international pressure would not succeed .
"" Brazil is the only country that has the moral authority to discuss [ Brazilian ] environmental issues , "" said Katia Abreu , senator and president of the Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock of Brazil .
"" I do n't understand why the NGOs oppose the changes .
The main NGOs are European but I do not see them asking Europe to revive its forests .
Why only in Brazil ?
We want to bring legal certainty for farmers with this bill .
I am convinced [ Rousseff ] will not veto . ""
Patrick Cunningham , of the Indigenous People 's Cultural Support Trust , said : "" The changes will overturn a law which even Brazil 's military dictatorship did n't dare to challenge , and will be an abrogation of the country 's laudable and longstanding commitment to protection of the fragile rainforest environment .

2012-05-25,"Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has partially vetoed a bill that would have weakened her country 's efforts to protect the Amazon and other forests .
Environmentalists cautiously welcomed the last - minute decision , which came after the most closely watched political debate of the year in Brazil .
But they warned that the battle was not yet over because large parts of the bill will still go through .
Last month , legislators in both houses passed a set of revisions to the Forest Code that threatened permanent preservation areas â€ “ a key provision in Brazilian environmental legislation â€ “ that obliged farmers to keep a proportion of their land as protected forests , particularly on the fringes of rivers and hillsides .
This requirement has long been opposed by Brazil 's powerful agricultural lobby .
Critics warned that the bill would reverse 20 years of struggle to protect the Amazon rainforest .
One study by SÃ£o Paulo University suggested the proposed revision could would result in deforestation of an additional 22 million hectares .
WWF , Greenpeace , the Brazilian Academy of Science and the Catholic Church urged Rousseff to completely veto the bill .
The global activist group , Avaaz , collected 2 million signatures opposing the legislation .
With Brazil due to host the Rio+20 Earth Summit next month , approval of the bill would also have set a poor example of sustainability ahead of a conference that aims to set a new roadmap for the global environment .
But the bill was popular among powerful landowners , farmers and many business people , who said it would be good for the economy to ease protection measures .
Forced to choose between these diverging forces , president Rousseff compromised by using a line veto to reject 12 clauses â€ “ including an amnesty for illegal loggers - and to amend 32 others , such as a requirement for large landowners to reforest illegally cleared land .
"" It 's the code of those who believe it 's possible to produce food and preserve the environment , "" Agriculture minister Jorge Ribeiro Mendes told reporters in announcing the partial veto .
Reflecting Rousseff 's long - stated desire to reduce the pressure on small , poorer farmers , the protection requirements are expected to be watered down for smaller tranches of land .
"" The big ( farmers ) have vast extensions of land and have the means to recover all the areas of permanent preservation , "" Brazilian environment minister Izabella Teixeira said .
Conservation groups gave cautious praise to the Brazilian president , but withheld a final judgment until the scope of the partial veto is clarified next week . ""
President Rousseff has apparently acceded to Brazilian public opinion in vetoing the most flagrantly irresponsible sections of the ranchers ' Forest Code , but we 're not out of the woods yet , "" said Jennifer Haverkamp , International Climate Program Director of the US - based Environmental Defence Fund .
"" What these vetoes really mean for the future of the forest - and whether the law can be effectively enforced - will depend on the specifics of the executive order that the president will issue on Monday .
"" The bill now goes back to Congress , and legislators have 30 days to override Rousseff 's changes with a simple majority , which is considered unlikely .
About 20 % of Brazil 's Amazon rainforest has been destroyed .
But beginning in 2008 , the government stepped up enforcement , using satellite images to track the destruction and send environmental police into areas where deforestation was happening at its quickest pace .
Amazon deforestation slowed and hit its lowest recorded level from August 2010 through July 2011 , when just 2,410 square miles ( 6,240 square kilometres ) were felled .
However , there are just 1,400 federal environmental police to cover the vast and often impenetrable Amazon along with the rest of Brazil , leading environmentalists to worry that further drops in the destruction may be unlikely and might even return to increasing because the new bill loosens restrictions .
Opponents of the bill also argue that while government enforcement did help slow deforestation , temporary economic factors also played a role that demand for the cattle , soy , timber and iron ore produced in the Amazon fell in the United States and Europe as the global financial crisis took hold .
It 's feared the appetite for those goods will increase and lead to a resumption in destruction once the world economy recovers .
The most contentious part of the bill passed by Congress was that it scrapped most protections for riverbanks , including maintaining strips of forest 30 yards ( metres ) to 100 yards ( metres ) deep along waterways .
The version sent to Rousseff mandated only that small rivers maintain 15 yards ( metres ) of forest along their banks , which are sensitive to rapid erosion that can then reduce water quality , promote flooding and affect the plants and animals that use the rivers to survive .
Teixeira hinted that this could continue by saying protection measures would remain strong in sensitive ecosystems .
But this - like other key elements - will not be clear until next week ."
2012-06-01,"A coalition of Brazil 's leading conservation groups have condemned the country 's president Dilma Rousseff for pardoning illegal deforesters , weakening protection of the Amazon and rowing back on efforts to recover land that has been cleared of trees .
The fierce attack on Rousseff 's environmental credentials comes just weeks before she is due to host more than 100 world leaders in an Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro that aims to put global development and economic growth on a more sustainable track .
The Brazil Committee in Defence of the Forests â€ “ a coalition of more than 200 civil society entities â€ “
said the president had destroyed her credibility by approving changes to the Forest Code , which is the country 's most important piece of legislation for protecting the Amazon and other forest areas .
Last week , Rousseff 's office announced that she had partially vetoed the proposed revision of the code but as details have subsequently emerged of what went through , the ire of conservationists has risen .
According to the committee , the new Forest Code will waive fines and ease requirements for restitution of areas that were illegally deforested in the past .
The bands of tree cover that must be left intact along riverbanks has been reduced by 80 % and approval has been granted for the use of non - native species , such as eucalyptus , for restoration projects .
"" There will be losses in the quality and quantity of waters , and losses for the conservation of biodiversity .
The concept of Areas of Permanent Protection has become meaningless "" ,
AndrÃ ©
Lima , public policies coordinator at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute , was quoted as saying in the group 's statement .
Brazilian ministers have said the changes were necessary to balance food production with forest protection .
The campaigners accused legislators and the president of bowing to the powerful agricultural lobby and putting export profits above Brazilian public opinion and global concerns for the environment . ""
President Dilma Rousseff has broken her campaign promises and squandered an opportunity to be a global environmental leader .
With the eyes of the world on Brazil for Rio+20 , we will keep up the pressure to protect our forests .
The whole world needs to know of the huge discrepancy between talk and action in Brazil "" , Kenzo Juca Ferreira , public policies specialist for WWF - Brazil , said ."
2012-06-07,"Deforestation of the Amazon has fallen to its lowest levels since records began , according to data recently released by Brazil 's National Institute for Space Research .
The boost for the environment comes a week after president Dilma Rousseff was criticised for weakening the forest protection measures widely credited for the improvement , and two weeks before Brazil hosts the Rio+20 Earth summit .
Using satellite imagery , the institute said 6,418 sq km of Amazon forest was stripped in the 12 months before 31 July 2011 â€ “ the smallest area since annual measurements started in 1988 .
The data continues an encouraging trend .
Since the peak deforestation year of 2004 , the rates of clearance have fallen by almost 75 % . ""
This reduction is impressive ; it is the result of changes in society , but it also stems from the political decision to inspect , as well as from punitive action by government agencies , "" Rousseff said .
She was speaking at a ceremony on Tuesday to mark the opening of two new nature reserves : the 34,000-hectare ( 83,980 acres )
Bom Jesus Biological Reserve in ParanÃ ¡ , and the 8,500-hectare ( 20,995 acres ) Furna Feia National Park in Rio Grande do Norte .
To mark World Environment Day , the Brazilian president also signed a number of other measures to expand existing parks , protect areas of biodiversity and recognise the land rights of indigenous communities .
Rousseff said Brazil was "" one of the most advanced countries "" for sustainable development , but its impressive efforts have been undermined by new legislation that reduces requirements on farms created by illegal logging to reforest portions of cleared land .
Under domestic and international pressure , Rousseff vetoed 12 of the most controversial sections of the revised Forest Code , but environmentalists are furious that many other changes will go through .
The Brazilian government insists that the compromise was a realistic balance of agricultural and environmental priorities .
Environment minister Izabella Teixeira says 81.2 % of the country 's original forest remains â€ “ one of the highest levels in the world .
But 10 former environment ministers have criticised the measures as a "" retrograde step "" .
In an unusual cross - party collaboration , they jointly signed a letter opposing the change to a code that they described as "" the single most relevant institutional basis for the protection afforded to forests and all the other forms of natural vegetation in Brazil .
"" Economic and technological factors have also contributed to the slowing of clearance rates .
The rise in the value of the Brazilian currency and the fall of soya and beef prices in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis eroded the incentive for land clearance for agricultural exports .
Implementing regulations remains extremely difficult in the wild west - like frontiers of the Amazon and the interior forest regions .
But enforcement has been strengthened by increasingly precise satellite monitoring by the National Institute for Research in the Amazon .
This November , Brazil plans to launch a new satellite with a resolution of five metres , up from the current level of 250 metres .
With close - to - real - time date , the central authorities are able to quickly notify federal police and environment officials about ongoing , illegal land clearance operations .
The government has also responded rapidly and flexibly .
After a two - month spurt of clear - cutting in Mato Grosso early last year , it established a task force to strengthen countermeasures and sent 700 inspectors to the region .
This year , eight municipalities were added to the list of critical areas , bringing them under closer inspection .
According to local media , the task force has apprehended 325 trucks , 72 bulldozers and 62,000 cubic metres of illegally cut timber and embargoed 79,500 hectares of land in the region .
The environment ministry says further factors in the drop of deforestation are regularisation of land tenure , initiatives to encourage sustainable practices and the expansion of protected areas .
According to the UN Global Biodiversity Outlook , Brazil accounts for nearly 75 % of the 700,000 sq km of protected areas created around the world since 2003 ."

"" I have told the prime minister that Brazil has done its share in efforts to improve the recovery of the world economy by means of stimuli to jobs and growth . ""
The president lavished praise on Cameron for his successful visit to Brazil , saying she was impressed that he visited all three main cities â€ “ SÃ£o Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia .
Cameron responded by supporting Brazil 's campaign to have a permanent seat on the UN security council .
He said : "" As Brazil takes its place on the global stage , so it 's case for permanent membership of the UN security council becomes ever stronger .
We support Brazilian membership .
"" We wo n't always agree about every issue , but what 's important is that we have open and honest conversations about the difficult issues and form practical partnerships to get things done together . ""
Cameron ended his trip to Brazil by launching a treaty to encourage the production of more Anglo - Brazilian blockbuster films .
Speaking at his press conference with Rousseff , Cameron said he wanted to see more productions of films such as the James Bond adventure Moonraker that was shot in Rio .
Cameron , who claims to be a big Bond fan , said : "" In film [ we have agreed ] a new film co - production treaty which will offer incentives for our budding film makers to work together and make a new generation of blockbusters with those unforgettable moments like Bond hanging over Sugar Loaf Mountain . ""
The treaty , signed by the trade minister Lord Green and the Brazilian foreign minister Antonio Patriota , was one of 10 treaties signed during his visit to Brasilia .

This article was amended on 1 October 2012 because the original said described Antonio Patriota as the Brazilian culture minister .
He is the foreign minister ."
2012-10-18,"Dilma Rousseff may be one of Brazil 's most popular presidents ever
but even she knows better than to challenge the prime - time power of the TV phenomenon known as Avenida Brasil .
Rousseff , who enjoys a 62 % approval rating , postponed a rally to endorse her party 's candidate in a SÃ£o Paulo mayoral race on Friday because it would coincide with the finale of the telenovela .
The last episode of Avenida Brasil is tipped to be a 70-minute storm of melodrama that includes a polygamous wedding , a celebratory feast and the answer to the question on tens of millions of Brazilian lips : "" Who killed Max ? ""
Against such competition , presidential aides feared the rally would fall flat : even hardcore politicos are likely to stay at home to see the mystery solved .
Several newspapers pointed out that Rousseff is a fan of the show â€ “ which has been running up to six days a week since March â€ “ and may simply have wanted to be among the 50 % of the viewing public expected to tune in for the climax .
It makes political sense for the president to tune into Avenida Brasil 's audience , which has come to epitomise the rise of a formerly poor social group that is now in the most powerful consumer stratum in the country .
Brazil 's "" C - class "" â€ “ as they are categorised â€ “ have grown rapidly in size and influence over the past decade thanks to the growth of the Brazilian economy , widening credit lines and the government 's efforts to address income inequality .
Since 2004 , the government says , 32 million Brazilians have been lifted out of poverty .
Last year , this helped the C - class â€ “ defined as those earning between 1,000 and 4,500 reals ( Â£300-Â£1,400 ) a month â€ “ to constitute for the first time a majority of Brazil 's population of 196 million .
Ten years ago , they needed every penny to meet their bills .
Today they have enough disposable income to buy mobile phones , laptops and motorbikes .
According to a study commissioned by the president 's office , the C - class accounts for 76 % of supermarket sales and 60 % of visits to hairdressing salons .
With this group increasingly beloved by advertisers , TV producers at Rede Globo â€ “ the channel that dominates the "" telenovela "" industry â€ “ are angling more shows and lucrative product placement opportunities in their direction .
Few more so than Avenida Brasil , which is named after a busy road in Rio de Janeiro that leads from rundown suburban communities and favela shanty towns into the smart city centre .
Dating back to 1951 , telenovelas have long been a feature of Brazilian life and often mix plots from different classes and a range of controversial issues .
But rarely has a prime - time drama pushed more C - class buttons .
This is evident in the opening credits , set over a baile charme dance track and images of a pulsating nightclub , and the bling - bedecked cast of characters â€ “ a cuckolded footballer , the owner of a manicure parlour and the sparsely clad piriguete party girl , Suelen .
Mariana Zylberkan , a columnist for Veja magazine , says the show represents a shift from the plush restaurants and bossa nova rhythms of upmarket Rio to the barbecues and techno of the C - class .
"" The profile of the characters is unprecedented among the telenovelas of the past 10 years , "" she writes , calculating that 79 % belong to the "" new middle class "" .
Marieta Pinheiro de Carvalho , a history lecturer at the University of Rio de Janeiro , said the focus on C - class was becoming a trend . ""
In previous novelas , there was too much value placed on the richest class .
What is happening now is a classical part of the civilising process : groups that did n't have much power in the past now have more economic and social influence so they are contesting a greater public space .
"" Reflecting the optimism and the lingering vulnerability of the formerly poor , the plot features spectacular social rises and falls when match - deciding penalties are missed , wrongdoing is exposed and love affairs succeed or go awry .
At least two of the lead characters are raised in rubbish dumps .
One plots revenge .
The other , Max , has been murdered .
The culprit is the source of as much speculation this week as "" Who shot JR ? ""
at the 1980s peak of in the US soap Dallas â€ “ or the mystery over the killing of Dirty Den in EastEnders in the UK .
But there are distinct differences between British soap operas and Brazilian telenovelas , which tend to run in more intense bursts â€ “ every weekday over a roughly eight - month period , ending with a spectacular finale .
This is not that first time that a telenovela has overshadowed politics .
In 1993 , the impeachment of president Fernando Collor de Mello was pushed off the front pages by the real - life murder of soap opera star Daniella Perez , by the actor who was playing her jealous boyfriend in De Corpo e Alma ( Of Body and Soul ) .
The genre was recently thought to have been in terminal decline as audiences switched from hackneyed storylines to cable TV and the internet , while rivals in Mexico , Venezuela and even South Korea competed in the wider Latin American market .
But slicker HBO - like cinematography and a new generation of scriptwriters â€ “ such as JoÃ£o Emanuel Carneiro , who wrote Avenida â€ “ have revitalised the telenovela by appealing to the young and the C - class .
As Avenida Brasil approaches its finale with another murder , a marriage proposal and the creepy rantings of the father of the suddenly sympathetic villain Carminha , the ratings are creeping closer to the 50 % level , which has rarely been seen since the 1990s .
The last episode is expected to surpass that .
The outcome is , of course , secret .
But showbiz websites predict it will wrap up with a solution to Max 's murder , the wedding of the lead characters , and a huge party to mark the opening of a shopping mall in Divino â€ “ a perfect happy ending for the advertisers who adore the new consumer class .

2013-06-19,"Perhaps the most politically significant moment in the two weeks of popular protests that have shaken Brazil came at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup last Saturday .
In Brasilia 's brand new football stadium , the crowd rose to their feet , turned their backs on the national team and loudly booed the president , Dilma Rousseff .
It was not exactly a Nicolae Ceausescu moment , and talk of a "" Brazilian spring "" is overblown â€ “ but the crowd 's reaction shows a dissatisfaction with Brazilian politics that was latent until now .
Hundreds of thousands have marched in demonstrations protesting against the rising cost of living , government corruption and the costs of staging major "" prestige "" events such as the World Cup and the Olympics .
Political protests are nothing new in Brazil , nor is the extreme violence with which they are often dealt by the police .
What marks the current wave out is not just that they are bigger than usual , but a sense that they represent a much broader and still not entirely articulated sentiment .
It started with protests against a 20 centavo ( about 6p ) rise in bus fares in SÃ£o Paulo .
Stones were thrown and acts of vandalism carried out during some protests .
The police responded with teargas , pepper - spray and rubber bullets , injuring journalists and passersby , as well as the protesters themselves .
The images spread quickly across YouTube and Facebook , with many drawing links between what was happening in Brazil and the events in Turkey .
This is probably the best comparison , because , like Turkey , Brazil has a government that is mainly supported by nation 's poor and has made some progress in some of the country 's systemic economic and social problems .
The reforms have halted in recent years and the political governing class is increasingly seen as arrogant and out - of - touch .
As in Turkey , the protest movement is led by mainly young , middle - class activists whose political philosophy does not conform to the traditional left - right dichotomy .
If there is a single demand they are making it can probably best be summed up as the "" right to citizenship "" .
Citizenship involves people holding governments to account and a real choice between parties .
Unfortunately Brazilian politics has become increasingly dominated by patronage , clientelism and ever more expensive marketing campaigns , which duck the difficult discussions .
The political ambiguity surrounding the protests makes their impact harder to gauge .
The government has repeatedly supported the right of demonstrators to protest peacefully , implicitly criticising the actions of various state governors who have authorised heavy - handed policing .
These have retorted that rising inflation , an underlying theme of the protests , is a result of the government 's mistaken economic policies .
With elections due next year and President Rousseff 's main opponent likely to be from the right - of - centre Social Democratic party ( PSDB ) , both sides are effectively staking out the ground that they wish to contest .
Brazil escaped the worst of the world 's financial crisis , but growth has slowed perceptibly and this makes the choices it now faces much harder .
Brazilian taxes are relatively high , but its social services and infrastructure are appallingly bad .
One complaint of the protesters is why should they have to pay so much for so little ?
While it is tempting to blame all this on government corruption â€ “ another slogan of the protesters â€
“
clearly there are also choices to be made about spending priorities .
President Rousseff â€ “ and her predecessor , "" Lula "" , â€ “ consciously targeted spending on social programmes , such as Bolsa Familia , which have succeeded in lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty , but failed to tackle other grossly wasteful and regressive elements of state spending .
The opposition shows a similar lack of enthusiasm for such reforms .
But without reform , the protests are likely to continue and this is exposing further fault - lines in the relationship between the government and the governed .
One of the most debated actions carried out by the police during their violent clampdown in SÃ£o Paulo was the arrest of people for carrying vinegar .
This is a perfectly lawful and nonviolent activity .
Its subversive intent lies in that it can be used to lessen the impact of teargas , canisters of which the police fired arbitrarily into crowds of commuters .
If the authorities believe that this is a legitimate exercise in state power , then perhaps the right to citizenship really is a revolutionary demand ."
2013-06-21,"Brazil 's president , Dilma Rousseff , and key ministers are to hold an emergency meeting on Friday following a night of protests that saw Rio de Janeiro and dozens of other cities echo with percussion grenades and swirl with teargas as riot police scattered the biggest demonstrations in more than two decades .
The protests were sparked last week by opposition to rising bus fares , but they have spread rapidly to encompass a range of grievances , as was evident from the placards . ""
Stop corruption .
Change Brazil "" ; "" Halt evictions "" ; "" Come to the street .
It 's the only place we do n't pay taxes "" ; "" Government failure to understand education will lead to revolution "" .
Rousseff 's office said she had cancelled a trip to Japan next week .
A former student radical herself , Rousseff has tried to mollify the protesters by praising their peaceful and democratic spirit .
Partly at her prompting , Rio , SÃ£o Paulo and other cities have reversed the increase in public transport fares , but this has failed to quell the unrest .
A vast crowd â€ “ estimated by the authorities at 300,000 and more than a million by participants â€ “ filled Rio 's streets , one of a wave of huge nationwide marches against corruption , police brutality , poor public services and excessive spending on the World Cup .
A minority of protesters threw stones , torched cars and pulled down lamp - posts .
Police responded by firing volleys of pepper spray and rubber bullets into the crowd and up onto overpasses where car drivers and bus passengers were stuck in traffic jams .
At least 40 people were injured in the city and many more elsewhere .
Simultaneous demonstrations were reported in at least 80 cities , with a total turnout that may have been close to 2 million .
An estimated 110,000 marched in SÃ£o Paulo , 80,000 in Manaus , 50,000 in Recife and 20,000 in Belo Horizonte and Salvador .
Clashes were reported in the Amazon jungle city of Belem , Porto Alegre in the south , Campinas north of SÃ£o Paulo and Salvador .
Thirty - five people were injured in the capital Brasilia , where 30,000 people took to the streets .
In SÃ£o Paulo , one man was killed when a frustrated car driver rammed into the crowd .
Elsewhere countless people , including many journalists , were hit by rubber bullets .
The vast majority of those involved were peaceful .
Many wore Guy Fawkes masks , emulating the global Occupy campaign .
Others donned red noses
â€ “ a symbol of a common complaint that people are fed up being treated as clowns .
"" There are no politicians who speak for us , "" said Jamaime Schmitt , an engineer .
"" This is not just about bus fares any more .
We pay high taxes and we are a rich country , but we ca n't see this in our schools , hospitals and roads .
"" Many in the mostly young , middle class crowd were experiencing their first large protest .
Matheus Bizarria , who works for the NGO Action Aid , said people had reached the limit of their tolerance about longstanding problems that the Confederations Cup and World Cup have brought into focus because of the billions of reals spent on new stadiums rather than public services .
Rio is also due to host a papal visit to World Youth Day next month , and the Olympics in 2016 .
"" It 's totally connected to the mega - events , "" Bizarria said .
"" People have had enough , but last year only 100 people marched against a bus price rise .
There were 1,000 last week and 100,000 on Monday .
Now we hope for a million . ""
Initially the mood in Rio was peaceful .
When a handful of people began tearing down posters for the Confederations Cup , the rest of the crowd sat down around them and shamed them with shouts of "" no violence "" and "" no vandalism "" .
But later protesters pulled down security cameras , smashed bus stops and torched cars .
Every hoarding that advertised the Confederations Cup was destroyed .
Police had increased their numbers more than 10-fold from Monday , and were quickly on the offensive .
After a confrontation near the city hall , they drove back the protesters , who fled coughing and with tears streaming down their cheeks .
At least one person was hit by rubber bullets , and showed the bruise on his leg where he was hit .
Some were furious that the police action seemed indiscriminate . ""
Where we had been tranquil , then suddenly they started firing gas into the crowd .
People were scared and appalled , "" said Alessandra Sampaio , one of the protesters .
"" They are cowards .
They wanted to disperse the crowd never mind who it was .
I 'm very angry .
It was a real abuse of power . ""
Victor Bezerra , a law student , said the police action was like something from the dictatorship era .
"" These are bad days for Brazil .
The police were acting just like they did 30 years ago .
"" The crowd were driven into side streets and back towards the central station by lines of police backed by officers carrying shotguns on horseback and motorbikes . ""
Look at this .
It 's hard to believe .
Terrible ! ""
, said Ellie Lopes , a 22-year - old passerby , as she surveyed the debris and flames .
Riot police eventually cleared the entire central area , but they were still dispersing gatherings in the Lapa music and bar district late into the night .
As helicopters buzzed overhead , they fired teargas into the crowded square next to a concert by the band Cannibal Corpse .
Hotdog kiosk vendors found themselves with sore and streaming eyes , inadvertently pushed onto a moving frontline .
Despite the crackdown , many said they would return to the streets for the next demonstration , planned for Saturday .

2013-06-21,"Football supporters fleeing rubber bullets , roads into stadiums blocked by angry crowds , mobs throwing stones at Fifa offices , Confederations Cup placards being ripped down and burned in the midst of mass protests .
These are unlikely scenes in a football - mad country and the last thing organisers of the World Cup wanted to see in Brazil before next year 's tournament , but for the past week they have become an almost daily occurrence as the country 's favourite sport has become the focus of the biggest demonstrations in decades .
In a speech broadcast nationally on Friday night the Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , said she accepted the need for change but warned that violence would not be tolerated and appealed to protesters not to endanger the World Cup .
More than a million people took to the streets on Thursday night in at least 80 cities in a rising wave of protest that has coincided with the Confederations Cup .
This Fifa event was supposed to be a dry run for players and organisers before next year 's finals , but it is police and protesters who are getting the most practice .
The host cities have been the focus of furious demonstrations , prompting local authorities to request security reinforcements from the national government .
The rallies , and the violence that has often followed , were not solely prompted by the tournament .
The spark last week was a rise in public transport fares .
Anger has since been further stirred by police brutality .
Longstanding problems such as corruption , dire public services , high prices and low levels of safety are also prominent among the range of grievances .
But the mega - event has been the lightning conductor .
Many protesters are furious that the government is spending 31bn reals ( Â£9bn ) to set the stage for a one - time global tournament , while it has failed to address everyday problems closer to home .
"" I 'm here to fight corruption and the expense of the World Cup , "" said Nelber Bonifcacio , an unemployed teacher who was among the vast crowds in Rio on Thursday .
"" I like football , but Brazil has spent all that money on the event when we do n't have good public education , healthcare or infrastructure .
"" It was all very different in 2007 when Brazil was awarded the tournament .
Back then , crowds in Rio erupted with joy and Ricardo Teixeira , president of the Brazilian Football Confederation , was hailed as he said : "" We are a civilised nation , a nation that is going through an excellent phase , and we have got everything prepared to receive adequately the honour to organise an excellent World Cup . ""
In the outside world , few doubted the wisdom of the decision .
Football belonged in Brazil .
In the home of carnival and samba , it would be a party like no other .
But euphoria has steadily faded as preparations for 2014 have drawn attention to the persistent ills of corruption , cronyism , inequality and public insecurity .
Those who appeared to have the Midas touch in 2007 now seem cursed .
Teixeira was forced to resign last year amid accusations of bribery .
Former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has been tainted by revelations of massive vote - buying by the ruling Workers party .
Fifa too is mired in a series of corruption scandals that have led to the resignations of several senior executives .
The renovation and construction of most of the 12 World Cup stadiums has been late and over budget .
Several have been pilloried as white elephants because they are being built in cities with minor teams .
The new Â£325 m ManÃ © Garrincha stadium in BrasÃ­lia
â€ “ which hosted the opening game of the Confederations Cup â€
“ has a capacity of 70,000 , but the capital 's teams rarely attract more than a few hundred fans .
Similarly , the lower - division sides in CuiabÃ ¡ and Manaus will struggle to fill a fraction of their 40,000 plus - seater stadiums .
The government downplays such concerns , saying the stadiums promote development and have been built for multi - purpose use so they do not have to rely on football for revenue .
But suspicions that the construction companies â€ “ a main source of kickbacks for politicians â€ “ will be the main beneficiaries of the tournament have grown , particularly in Rio , where the MaracanÃ£ stadium has been refurbished for the second time in a decade at a cost of more than 1bn reals ( Â£295 m ) .
It was rebuilt with public money , but the concession to run it has been offered to a private firm , covering barely a fifth of the costs .
Meanwhile , Fifa has announced record revenues from broadcasting rights and corporate sponsorship for 2014 â€ “ none of which will go to Brazil 's public coffers .
With negative headlines also related to evictions and poor engineering quality , the growing public unease alarmed many in the sport even before the protests began .
Former national team players RomÃ¡rio , TostÃ£o and Zico have been warning for many months that something is amiss .
"" The population of Brazil seems distant from the World Cup because of what people see as corruption and the overspend on the stadiums and the lack of transparency , "" Zico told the Guardian .
With public fury now on full display , football 's leading lights also seem divided about how to respond .
The Fifa president , Sepp Blatter , and PelÃ ©
â€ “
the superstar turned MasterCard ambassador â€ “ have drawn derision by calling on protesters to decouple the Confederations Cup and the demonstrations .
Ronaldo has been lambasted for remarking : "" A World Cup is n't made with hospitals , my friend .
It 's made with stadiums . ""
Bruno Danna , a shop employee who joined the protests on Thursday , said : "" I 'm not against football .
I will cheer the national team .
But I 'm mad at Ronaldo and PelÃ © . ""
The current national team , in contrast , have been vocal in their support for the demonstrations .
"" I want a Brazil that is fair and safe and healthier and more honest ! "" wrote Neymar on his Instagram blog .
The Chelsea defender David Luiz and the midfielder Hulk have also expressed solidarity with those on the street .
What happens next is hard to predict .
The government has backed down on the bus fare increase , but it will be harder to meet the protesters ' demands about the World Cup .
The funds are mostly spent and the stadiums can not be unbuilt .
The next potential flashpoints are the Brazil v Italy game in Salvador , and Japan v Mexico in Belo Horizonte before more planned marches on Saturday , as well as the final on 30 June .
Fifa has denied speculation that it will call off the Confederations Cup , and the authorities have beefed up security .
But the tense situation is hurting the chances of a successful event next year .
In a country where football is almost the national religion , people want to enjoy the World Cup , but for millions Fifa has become a tainted brand , associated with a distant global elite who profit at the expense of local people .
As one banner , held aloft by a football - loving protester â€ “ Leandro Ferreir â€ “ said on Thursday : "" We do n't want a country that is beautiful only for gringos . """
2013-06-24,"Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has proposed a referendum on political reform and a new £ 17bn public transport programme in her latest attempt to mollify the protest movement that brought more than a million people on to the streets last week .
After a meeting with mayors and governors of cities that have experienced the often violent unrest , the president also promised new measures on health and job creation .
With four deaths confirmed so far from the continuing protests , the president has called for peace and pledged to respond to the demands of the demonstrators .
"" Brazil is ripe to advance , "" she said in a statement released by her office on Monday .
"" We must also put a priority on tougher measures to combat corruption in all spheres . ""
Details of the reform referendum have yet to be fleshed out , but Rousseff said she would immediately move to tighten penalties for corruption with a new law that would classify it as a more serious crime .
Earlier in the day , she had also meet with organisers of the demonstrations , which started earlier this month in opposition to a hike in bus and train fares but escalated to embrace public anger over a range of issues , including poor public services and the high costs of hosting the World Cup .
Fleshing out a promise made last week , Rousseff said she would create a National Public Transport Council , funded with 50bn reals ( £ 14.5 m ) , that would work with civil society to expand and strengthen urban mobility projects .
However , Mayara Longo Vivian , one of the leaders of the Free Fare Movement who met Rousseff in Brasilia , told the Associated Press that no concrete measures were given to the group and that their "" fight would continue . ""
The president , who was a Marxist guerrilla in her youth , has launched an increasingly broad series of steps in the past week in response to public demands for change .
After major protests last Monday , she encouraged local government to drop plans for a hike in bus and train fares , which had been the initial focus of the demonstrations .
Following an even bigger march last Thursday , she promised to channel billions of dollars of oil revenue into education programs .
Many commentators have contrasted her willingness to respond to the voices on the street with the more intractable stance taken by Turkey 's leadership .
As well as her own background as a student radical , Rousseff 's steps are also guided by political and economic pragmatism .
After the World Cup next year , she faces re - election .
Although she remains popular with an approval rate well over 50 % , her ratings recently slipped for the first time since she took office .
The protests have also eroded confidence in the Brazilian economy , which has been in the doldrums for the past year .
Fearing violence , shopping malls in many cities closed early over the weekend with a revenue loss estimated at about £ 350 m .
In the past month , Brazilian stock prices are down by almost a fifth and the currency has lost more than 10 % against the dollar .
Demonstrations continue to take place every day , though none have come close to the scale of the marches on Thursday that drew between 1 and 2 million people in 80 cities .
The death toll doubled on Monday when a vehicle rammed into a protest barricade in Goias state , killing two women .
Demonstrators also blocked a road into Brazil 's busiest port , Santos .
At the weekend , tens of thousands staged a demonstration in Belo Horizonte , leading to clashes and tear gas when they moved close to a police perimeter around the stadium where Mexico were playing Japan in a Confederations Cup match .
Smaller protests were also staged in Salvador , São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and more than a dozen other cities .
More are planned in the coming days , though the intensity seems to have ebbed for the moment ."
2013-06-26,"Rival organisations behind Brazil 's huge street demonstrations are struggling for control amid conflicting views about the political direction the movement should take .
With further action planned for Wednesday evening , the leftwing groups who initiated the marches suspect opposition parties are trying to hijack the protests and use them as a platform to challenge president Dilma Rousseff 's government before next year 's presidential election .
The protesters have proved a formidable political force , notching up victory after victory in the past week and forcing Rousseff 's Workers ' Party and regional leaders into a series of concessions .
But the scale has ebbed in recent days .
Although demonstrations continue on a daily basis in Rio de Janeiro , SÃ£o Paulo and dozens of other cities , they are on a smaller scale than last Thursday 's march of more than a million .
The vast majority of marches have been unified , but there have been a few shouting matches between rival groups competing to set the ideological direction of the protests .
Some would like a stronger focus on inequality and improving conditions in favelas .
Others are pushing for tax cuts and a crackdown on corrupt officials .
In online chat rooms and microblogs , there is speculation that police are using agents provocateurs to stir up violence and pave the way for a coup .
Evidence for that is scant , but differences have become more apparent .
Groups such as Anonymous are calling for a period of reflection , and arranged workshops and public meetings in Rio this week to discuss where to go next .
But several organisations that are closer to the right pressed ahead with smaller gatherings on Monday and urged more on Thursday .
Two of them , Organisation Opposed to Corruption and Online Revolution , advocate the return of militarism , according to an article on the Estado de SÃ£o Paulo website .
This followed tension in SÃ£o Paulo during last Thursday 's march when some groups burned the flags of the Workers Party .
"" We live in a democracy and this reaction is a kind of nationalism taken to an extreme .
I fear this may be hidden fascism , "" said Talita Saito , a 21-year - old law student at the protest .
Such incidents have so far been on the fringes .
More positive is the sign of a new political debate that has been stirred up by formerly apathetic multitudes who are turning out in vast numbers to peacefully back the protests .
But those who initiated the protests in support of cheap public transport are uneasy that part of the movement has morphed towards a campaign for lower taxes .
A major reason for the success of last week 's marches was that the organisers rejected affiliation with political parties .
The amorphous movement embraced frustrations felt across the political spectrum , many of them brought into relief by the Confederations Cup .
About 50,000 people joined a demonstration on Wednesday outside a stadium in Belo Horizonte , where Brazil were playing Uruguay in a Confederations Cup semi - final .
Police fired tear gas and protesters threw stones .
In Brasilia , where the other semi - final was taking place , police shut down traffic in the city centre in expectation of unrest .
After last Thursday 's march , the huge range of motivations was evident in the hand - written placards pinned on to the walls â€ “ "" Schools not Stadiums "" , "" 70bn in Corruption "" , ""
End Police Violence "" , "" Stop PEC 37 "" ( a bill that would weaken the power of the public minister to investigate official wrongdoing ) and "" No to the Gay Cure "" ( a reference to evangelical politician Marco Feliciano 's call for Brazil 's medical establishment to treat homosexuality as a disease .
In recent days , Rousseff â€ “ a former student radical â€
“ has talked to organisers and responded to some of their concerns .
On Monday , she promised a referendum on political reform , tighter penalties for corruption , a 50bn real ( Â£15bn ) programme for public transport and more support for healthcare and education .
Another concession was won from legislators , who dropped the PEC 37 bill .
The groups behind the protests say Rousseff 's promises are too vague and fall short of demands they have regarding evictions of residents for mega - events , excessive police violence ( seen on Tuesday in a raid on the MarÃ © favela in Rio that left at least nine people dead ) and wider issues of inequality and environmental destruction .
A statement by the Passe Libre group said the government has to do more to rein in paramilitary police , who have shot protesters with rubber bullets and used teargas indiscriminately .
"" There is an urgent need to demilitarise the police and put in place a national policy to regulate less lethal weapons , which are banned in many countries and condemned by international bodies , "" the group said .
Alan Fragoso , one of the organisers of the FÃ³rum de Lutas group that initiated the protests , said the demonstrations would continue .
"" Even if the protesters do not have full political consciousness we must seize the moment to promote the inclusion of political debate in the daily life of Brazilians , "" he said .
In response to Rousseff 's promises and concerns about the vandalism that followed clashes with police , the organisers plan to set new guidelines for the protests .
One question will be how the movement can address inequality .
Halting bus price rises alone will not achieve this if it means spending cuts in other areas of social spending , as the SÃ£o Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad noted .
So far most of the marchers have been middle class students , protesting in the city centres or near football stadiums .
But on Tuesday came the first march in Rio from two favela communities â€ “ Rocinha and Vidigal â€ “ to the wealthy middle - class neighbourhood of Leblon , which is home to the state governor , SÃ © rgio Cabral .
"" This is not about left or right .
We 're fed up with our leaders .
We ca n't rely on public hospitals or schools , yet they spend billions on stadiums , "" said Anderson Castro , who turned up to the lively , peaceful , but relatively small march with his young son Arthur on his shoulders .
The coming days are likely to clarify where , how and whether the demonstrations will continue on a large scale , with the attention of many focused on Sunday 's Confederations Cup final in Rio .

2013-08-28,"Dilma Rousseff , the Brazilian president , has accused the nation 's doctors of "" immense prejudice "" towards their Cuban counterparts after the first medics to arrive from Havana were greeted with jeers .
The Cuban doctors have been invited to work in Brazil to support the fragile health system – one of the issues that prompted mass protests in June .
Under the government 's Mais Médicos ( More Doctors ) programme , 4,000 Cuban professionals will work in poor and remote areas of Brazil that are short of hospital staff .
After the first contingent of 400 arrived at the weekend they were booed by local doctors , who oppose what they describe as a stop - gap measure that fails to address the need for more investment in hospitals and better pay for doctors .
A video of the encounter in Ceará shows Brazilian doctors chanting "" slave "" at the Cubans .
This appeared to be a reference to a payment system under which the Cuban government will receive more than a quarter of the doctors ' £ 2,700 monthly salaries .
The Brazilian Medical Association has filed a lawsuit in the supreme court questioning the need for the programme .
One medical group in Minas Gerais says its members will refused to help the foreign doctors if they have problems .
The federal medical council , which licenses doctors , has stated that the recruitment of doctors with locally invalid diplomas and poor language skills is illegal and endangers the lives of Brazilians .
Government officials have depicted Brazilian doctors as a cossetted urban elite , reluctant to move away from high - paying private institutions in Rio de Janeiro , São Paulo and other big cities .
The health minister , Alexandre Padilha , expressed outrage at their treatment by their Brazilian counterparts : "" This is very brutal ; it incites prejudice and xenophobia , "" he said .
The president strongly defended the Cuban doctors in a radio interview on Wednesday in which she stressed that the newcomers would only work in the Amazon and in remote places where domestic doctors were unwilling to practise .
According to the president , there are 700 municipalities in Brazil without a single doctor .
Rousseff noted that fewer than 2 % of the doctors in Brazil were foreign , compared with rates of 25 % in the US and 36 % in Canada .
The Mais Médicos initiative aims to address the shortage by recruiting health professionals from Portugal , Argentina and elsewhere , but the president said that only the doctors from Havana had been criticised .
"" We have seen instances of immense prejudice against the Cuban doctors , "" she said .
"" I can assure you we will do all we can within the law to bring doctors to places where there are no doctors . ""
Medical expertise is one of Cuba 's main exports and has been used to cement ties between Havana and political allies overseas .
There are Cuban doctors in more than a dozen nations , including Venezuela – where they were paid for in oil under the late president Hugo Chavez – and Haiti , where they have been on the frontline of efforts to rein in its cholera epidemic .
In Brazil , the plan to recruit Cuban doctors has been controversial since it was proposed earlier this year .
In July , the government said it was postponing the programme in the face of demonstrations by Brazilian doctors , who insist the country can meet its needs with homegrown medics .
Last week , however , the health minister announced the overseas recruitment would go ahead to meet a shortfall in hospital staff in remote areas .
Brazil 's healthcare system is challenged by inequality and vast distances .
According to the World Bank , the country has 1.8 doctors for every 1,000 people – well below the 3.2 ratio in neighbouring Argentina , and significantly below those of Mexico , the US and UK .
In the first stage of the programme , Mais Médicos recruited 1,589 doctors , a third of whom were from other nations , including Spain and Russia .
But the government has said that almost 10 times this number are needed to fill the gaps in rural areas , particularly in the poor north and north - east of the country .
The shortfall will largely be filled by qualified foreigners , who will be given three - year contracts .
The government is also investing in medical colleges and hopes to see a sharp increase in the number of graduates over the next eight years .
The Cuban doctors have had three weeks to prepare for the very different medical system and language .
Juan Delgado , one of the Cuban doctors who was subjected to the "" slave "" chants , told reporters for the newspaper Folha that it would take time for attitudes to change .
"" This is not right , we are not slaves , "" he said , adding : "" The Brazilian doctors should do the same as we do : go to assist in the poorest places . """
2013-09-09,"The US National Security Agency has been accused of spying on Brazil 's biggest oil company , Petrobras , following the release of more files from US whistleblower Edward Snowden .
The latest disclosures , which aired on Brazil 's FantÃ¡stico news program , have led to accusations that the NSA is conducting intelligence - gathering operations that go beyond its core mission of national security â€ “ often cited as the key distinction between the agency and its counterparts in China and Russia .
The revelations are likely to further strain ties between the US and Brazil ahead of a planned state dinner for president Dilma Rousseff at the White House in October .
Bileteral relations have already been muddled by the earlier release of NSA files showing the US agency intercepted Brazilian communications and spied on Rousseff and her aides .
Petrobras is the largest company in Brazil and one of the 30 biggest businesses in the world .
Majority owned by the state , it is a major source of revenue for the government and is developing the biggest oil discoveries of this century , which are in a pre - salt region deep under the Atlantic .
FantÃ¡stico revealed a top secret NSA file â€ “ given by Snowden to Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald â€ “ which shows Petrobras is among several targets for the agency 's Blackpearl program , which extricates data from private networks .
Titled "" Private networks are important "" , the slide names Petrobras along with the Swift network for global bank transfers , the French foreign ministry and Google .
Several other targets on the list , which may have links to terrorist organisations and other operations that potentially threaten the US , were redacted .
In a similar vein , it presented a "" network exploitation "" document from Britain 's GCHQ , which works closely with the NSA , that affirms the importance of targetting companies in strategic industries .
One slide , headed "" Results â€ “ what do we find ?
"" , notes that private network traffic is collected from energy companies , financial organisations and airlines , as well as foreign governments .
But the TV report did not say when the alleged spying took place , what data might have been gathered or what exactly the agency may have been seeking .
Restating the surveillance and encryption - breaking techniques first reported in the Guardian and Washington Post , the program cast doubt on the NSA 's claims to be focussing solely on national security with its use of malware and covert implants Such techniques have also been used by Chinese hackers to acquire industrial and other secrets , but the NSA insists its goals are different . ""
The department does not engage in economic espionage in any domain , including cyber , "" the agency said in an emailed response to a Washington Post story on the subject last month .
In a statement issued on Sunday night after the latest revelations aired in Brazil , the US director of national intelligence , James Clapper , said : "" It is not a secret that the intelligence community collects information about economic and financial matters , and terrorist financing .
"" We collect this information for many important reasons : for one , it could provide the United States and our allies early warning of international financial crises which could negatively impact the global economy .
It also could provide insight into other countries ' economic policy or behavior which could affect global markets . ""
But he again denied this amounted to industrial espionage .
"" What we do not do , as we have said many times , is use our foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of â€ “ or give intelligence we collect to â€ “ US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line . ""
President Obama said last week that the US carefully limits its surveillance operations .
"" When it comes to intelligence gathering internationally , our focus is on counter terrorism , weapons of mass destruction , cybersecurity â€ “ core national interest of the United States , "" he said .
"" I can give assurances to the publics in Europe and around the world that we are not going around snooping at peoples emails or listening to phone calls .
We are targetting very specifically areas of concern . ""
However , several other documents released on Sunday suggest spying activities by the NSA potentially go beyond the scope of the agency 's stated goals .
In the overview of another surveillance operation called Blarney , one slide provides a list of requirements that includes "" economic "" information as well as military , diplomatic , political and counter proliferation and counter terrorism data .
These documents were released on Brazil 's Globo network following the broadcast by FantÃ¡stico â€ “ the country 's most influential current affairs program .
The program included speculation by experts and former Petrobras directors on the industrial secrets that the US might want to acquire , including deep - sea drilling technology .
The presenters said the espionage posed questions about whether the information would be used to benefit the competitiveness of companies in the US and its close allies .
The presenters noted that many top - secret US intelligence documents are categorised as FVEY ( five eyes ) relating to the national agencies entitled to see them : US , UK , Canada , Australia and New Zealand .
Petrobras has yet to respond to the report .
The report was made with the co - operation of Greenwald , who lives in Rio de Janeiro .
The previous week , he and FantÃ¡stico also released files showing the NSA monitored the phone calls and emails of Rousseff and her aides , as well as Mexico 's president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto .
In the wake of those revelations , Rousseff said her state visit to the US in October was in doubt .
"" My trip to Washington depends on the political conditions to be created by President Obama , "" she told reporters on Friday after talking to the US president during the G20 summit in St Petersburg .
She said the US president had reassured her that he would investigate the espionage and provide her with a full explanation by Wednesday . ""
As well as what has been published in the press , I want to know everything there is related to Brazil .
Everything , "" Rousseff said The former president of Brazil , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has also condemned the spying and insisted that the president of the United States should apologise to the world .
He called effort to control global telecommunications a violation of national sovereignty .
Fears that the US â€ “ and its British ally â€ “ have used "" national security "" to justify infringements on individual rights were strengthened last month when Greenwald 's partner , the Brazilian , David Miranda , was detained at London 's Heathrow Airport under UK anti - terrorism laws , after the British government had consulted with the US .
This disquiet is likely to spread to new sectors of society with evidence that the NSA is targetting the state - run Brazilian company that has access to many of the country 's most valuable natural assets ."
2013-09-17,"The Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , snubbed Barack Obama on Tuesday by postponing an official visit to Washington in protest at the spying activities of the US National Security Agency .
The row between the biggest economies in North and South America was the latest diplomatic fallout from the top - secret documents leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden .
In August , Obama announced he was pulling out of a bilateral meeting with the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , over Moscow 's decision to grant asylum to Snowden .
Despite a last - minute call from Obama , Rousseff 's office released a statement saying the political environment was not amenable for the planned trip on 23 October . ""
Given the proximity of the scheduled state visit to Washington and in the absence of a timely investigation â€ ¦ there are n't conditions for this trip to be made , "" the statement read .
"" The Brazilian government is confident that when the question is settled in an adequate manner , the state visit can quickly occur . ""
A statement from the White House said : "" The president has said that he understands and regrets the concerns disclosures of alleged US intelligence activities have generated in Brazil and made clear that he is committed to working together with President Rousseff and her government in diplomatic channels to move beyond this issue as a source of tension in our bilateral relationship . ""
As the president previously stated , he has directed a broad review of US intelligence posture , but the process will take several months to complete . ""
For this reason , the presidents have agreed to postpone President Rousseff 's state visit to Washington scheduled for October 23 . ""
The postponement followed reports that the NSA has monitored Rousseff 's telephone calls and emails , spied on communications by her aides and targeted Brazil 's biggest company , Petrobras .
Rousseff had earlier requested an explanation from Obama , but his reassurances failed to satisfy her concerns .
The announcement is at least a setback to bilateral relations , which appeared to have been improving since Rousseff came to power in 2011 .
She was the only foreign leader this year to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and business executives planned to use the visit to sign deals on oil exploration and fighter jet sales .
But details of US spying activities in Brazil enraged public opinion .
Based on leaked NSA files , Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald and Globo â€ “ Brazil 's biggest news group
â€ “ revealed earlier this month that the NSA ran surveillance programmes on Rousseff and her aides .
A week later , Greenwald ( who is based in Rio de Janeiro ) and Globo disclosed slides showing that the US spy agency targets Petrobras , the state - run energy company that controls some of the world 's biggest untapped oil supplies .
Earlier reports had shown that Brazil is among several countries that are subject to massive communications data monitoring by the US .
Unease about US activities has also been raised by the diversion of a plane carrying Bolivian president Evo Morales because it was suspected of carrying Snowden and the detention of Greenwald 's Brazilian partner David Miranda at Heathrow airport .
Former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva said Obama should apologise to the world .
Justice minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo said the reports , if confirmed , "" should be considered very serious and constitute a clear violation of Brazilian sovereignty "" .
In response , US officials have adopted a softer tone .
US national security adviser Susan Rice said the reports raised "" legitimate questions for our friends and allies "" .
But the White House has stopped short of the explanations and apologies requested by Brazil ."

Appearance :
Jack Black :
The Powerful Woman Years .
Who is she ?
The second - most powerful woman in the world .
Says who ?
And why ?
Says Forbes magazine .
Because she 's the president of Brazil .
And what has she done now ?
Snubbed the world 's most powerful man .
Rousseff has postponed an official visit to Washington to meet with Barack Obama .
On what grounds ?
On the grounds that there has yet to be "" a timely investigation "" into reports , based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden , that the US National Security Agency has been spying on her phone calls and emails , her aides and the state - controlled oil and gas firm Petrobras .
And this is a problem for her ?
Yes .
Quite a big problem .
Why ?
Apart from the fact that , as a rule , people do n't like being spied on ?
Because Rousseff is quite protective when it comes to Petrobras .
As are the people of Brazil .
The government - run firm is the country 's largest company and produces more than 90 % of Brazil 's oil and natural gas .
Plus Rousseff was chair of its board of directors for seven years .
Making it kind of her giant multibillion dollar baby .
So she 's an oil baron who went into politics ?
No , if anything she 's a radical politician who went into oil .
Rousseff 's political life began on the far left , in the underground resistance to the military dictatorship that seized power in Brazil in 1964 .
She was arrested in 1970 and tortured with electric shocks to her feet and ears , before spending the next three years in prison .
How did she get from there to president ?
With a steely determination for which she was dubbed Brazil 's "" Iron Lady "" .
She entered the government as energy minister , rose through the ranks , and ran for president after an extensive makeover – including heavy dental work and plastic surgery – to make her look softer and more electable .
But she 's still as hard as nails ?
Clearly .
And , after snubbing the US president , just a little bit more re - electable .
Do say : "" The lady 's not for alleged industrial espionage . ""
Do n't say : "" What , we ca n't spy on your state - run oil firm now ?
Come on ! """
2013-09-18,"Tuesday 's cancellation of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff 's state visit to the White House , scheduled for next month , came as little surprise .
Documents leaked by Edward Snowden , and reported by Glenn Greenwald and TV Globo , had caused an uproar in Brazil .
According to the documents and reports , the US government had spied on Dilma 's personal communications , and had targeted the computer systems of Brazil 's Petrobras , the big oil company that is majority - owned by the state .
TV Globo 's report indicated that there was information in the targeted Petrobas computer network that could be very valuable to foreign oil companies .
Former President Lula da Silva said that Obama should "" personally apologize to the world "" ; and Dilma also demanded a full public apology – which was not forthcoming .
The rift with Brazil comes at a time of worsening US relations with Latin America , and especially South America .
It is indicative of a much deeper problem .
The Obama administration 's refusal to recognize the results of the Venezuelan elections in April of this year , despite the lack of doubt about the results and in stark opposition to the rest of the region , displayed an aggressiveness that Washington had n't shown since it aided the 2002 coup .
It brought a sharp rebuke from South America , including Lula and Dilma .
Less than two months later , US Secretary of State John Kerry launched a new "" detente "" , meeting with his Venezuelan counterpart Elías Jaua in the first such high - level meeting in memory , and implicitly recognizing the election results .
But new hopes were quickly dashed when several European governments , clearly acting on behalf of the United States , forced down President Evo Morales ' plane in July .
"" They 've definitely gone crazy , "" President Cristina Kirchner tweeted , and UNASUR ( the Union of South American Nations ) issued a strong denunciation .
The gross violation of international law and diplomatic norms was another flamboyant display of Washington 's lack of respect for the region .
It seems that every month there is another indication of how little the Obama administration cares about improving relations .
On 24 July , the IMF , at the direction of the US Treasury Department , abandoned its plan to support the Argentine government in its legal battle with "" vulture funds "" .
The IMF had previously committed to filing a brief with the US supreme court supporting the Argentine government .
This was not out of love for Argentina , but because the lower court 's decision – which would try to prevent Argentina from paying 92 % of its creditors in order to satisfy the vulture funds – was seen as a threat to future debt restructuring and therefore to the world financial system .
But anti - Argentina lobbyists were allowed to prevail , even against the Treasury Department 's legitimate concern for international financial stability .
There are structural reasons for the Obama administration 's repeated failures to accept the new reality of independent governments in the region .
Although President Obama may want better relations , he is willing to spend about $ 2 in political capital to accomplish this .
And that is not enough .
When he tried to appoint an ambassador to Venezuela in 2010 , for example , Republicans ( including the office of then Senator Richard Lugar ) successfully scuttled it .
For President Obama , there are generally no electoral consequences from having bad relations with Latin America .
Unlike Afghanistan , Pakistan , Syria , or other areas of armed conflict or potential war , there is no imminent danger that something could blow up in his face , and cause political harm to his administration or party .
The main electoral pressure comes from those who want to oppose more aggressively the left governments : that is , rightwing Florida Cuban - Americans and their allies in Congress , who currently prevail in the House .
Most of the foreign policy establishment does n't care about the region at all , and the ones who do mainly share the view that the leftward shift is a temporary thing that can and should be reversed .
In the meantime , Washington is expanding its military presence where it has control ( for example , Honduras ) , and is ready to support the overthrow of left governments when the opportunity arises ( Honduras in 2009 , and Paraguay last year ) .
Back in 1972 , President Richard Nixon made a historic visit to China , which opened a new era of US - China relations .
He expressed a number of reasons for the shift in policy .
As he told his national security adviser Henry Kissinger : We 're doing the China thing to screw the Russians and help us in Vietnam and to keep the Japanese in line .
But he had also recognized something important , some 22 years after the Chinese revolution : that country 's independence was not going to be reversed .
Unfortunately , Washington has not yet reached the same conclusion about Latin America , and especially South America , whose "" second independence "" is perhaps one of the most important geopolitical changes in the world over the past 15 years .
There is virtually no recognition among the foreign policy establishment in DC – both inside and outside of government – that something important has changed , and that the US government must accept these changes and alter its policy accordingly .
Until that happens , do n't expect US - Latin American relations to get much warmer ."
2013-09-20,"When Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff postponed her official visit to the US in protest of National Security Agency spying activities on Tuesday , it seemed like a routine bit of diplomatic posturing .
But another one of her proposals could perhaps be more significant : a set of measures intended to extricate the internet in Brazil from under the influence of the US and its tech giants .
Some are claiming the country is embarking on a course that will cut itself off from the internet .
To international policy experts however , Rousseff 's proposals offer a more open and comprehensive discussion of issues that have been quietly brewing in the internet community . ""
The hope that Brazil has is that the measures would curb the control the US has in terms of infrastructure and that maybe it will be a pressure for the United States to change its practices that came to knowledge after the Snowden leak , "" said Marilia Maciel , a researcher who works on Internet security policy at Brazil 's Fundacao Getulio Vargas .
To do this , Rousseff proposed a set of ambitious , and controversial , measures that include : constructing submarine cables that do not route through the US , building internet exchange points in Brazil , creating an encrypted email service through the state postal service and having Facebook , Google and other companies store data by Brazilians on servers in Brazil .
"" I think that there is a feeling that the US has always had a prominent role in internet governance and they want to change that , "" Maciel said .
"" The conversation is under way , and it became prominent last year at Dubai .
"" It 's the conversation at the World Conference on International Telecommunications ( WCIT )
Dubai that has internet executives offering alarmist warnings about a balkanized internet that suppresses online freedom .
There , Russia and China explicitly stated their hopes to take control of the internet away from the US .
At a discussion in New York last week , Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt said he was more concerned about a balkanized internet than NSA surveillance and government spying .
The real danger [ from ] the publicity about all of this is that other countries will begin to put very serious encryption
â€ “
we use the term ' balkanization ' in general â€ “ to essentially split the internet and that the internet 's going to be much more country specific , "" Schmidt said .
"" That would be a very bad thing , it would really break the way the internet works , and I think that 's what I worry about . ""
Merlyna Lim , a visiting research scholar at Princeton University 's Center for Information and Technology Policy , said that balkanization is unlikely because of the significant technological , social , political and economic factors that would need to fall into place for it to become a reality .
"" I do n't think there are many countries that want to isolate themselves , from the US especially , at least for economic reasons , "" said Lim .
Lim said that the internet is also more localized than often portrayed because as the amount of people who use the internet increases , they turn to sites in their own language and within their own communities . ""
Internet is neither truly global nor truly nation - state , it is just in - between , it has always been like that
and it was an illusion that the internet was totally global , "" said Lim .
"" Having global communities ?
It never happened â€ “ in so many ways , internet has become more local . ""
Rousseff , however , is expected to bring the conversation about the role of the US government and US - based corporate multinationals to a global stage at the UN General Assembly at the end of this month .
And by discussing these measures now , Rousseff is taking the unusual step of having a diplomatic conversation about cyber espionage , said Camille FranÃ§ois , a researcher at Harvard University 's Berkman Center who has worked for Google and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) .
"" This is a conversation , in the open , about expectations : what countries expect from each other in that realm and how what they can leverage â€ “ domestic law , international law , technologies , etc
â€ “ to enable this state of peace , "" said FranÃ§ois .
She said that the internet is n't inherently US - centric , even though "" a significant part of Brazilians ' experience of the Internet is shaped by US companies , and they obey American law .
"" At a practical level , it would be "" very , very difficult "" for Brazil to cut its internet off from the rest of the world , said Andrew Blum , author of Tubes .
This is in part because in the last five years , the power of the internet has increasingly been put in the hands of companies like Google that have created super - networks that operate autonomously .
Blum said the power a tech giant like Google has is comparable to a person who owns an airplane , as opposed to a person with a ticket to ride â€ “ owning a network means less inspection into who visits their properties and what the company is doing with its network . ""
This Brazil proposal is a moment of correction against the incredible growth and power of the supernetworks , "" said Blum .
By offering these proposals , the Brazil government has led some to draw an equivalence with site - blocking in countries such as China , Iran and Bahrain . ""
With Brazil it 's a bit trickier , because I think they 've got the right intent , "" said Jillian York , director for international freedom at the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
"" But I do think it sets a really dangerous precedent , so in that sense it 's a bad idea â€ “ in the sense that if Brazil does it , you 're going to see all sorts of other countries going to do it . ""
She said other countries may use Brazil 's actions as a bargaining tool within their own countries , as China has done with the NSA surveillance revelations .
York said she thinks the chances of Brazil achieving internet sovereignty from the US are "" probably very slim , "" primarily because companies like Google and Facebook need to comply with requests to move their data servers in the country .
"" I think that it is a threat in and of itself to corral data off into any given country , because the Brazil government now is pretty progressive , but what if the next one 's not , "" York said .
"" If all your data is in your country , you 're sort of risking what 's happening in Iran right now , with Iran trying to cut off the Internet . """
2013-09-24,"Brazil 's president , Dilma Rousseff , has launched a blistering attack on US espionage at the UN general assembly , accusing the NSA of violating international law by its indiscriminate collection of personal information of Brazilian citizens and economic espionage targeted on the country 's strategic industries .
Rousseff 's angry speech was a direct challenge to President Barack Obama , who was waiting in the wings to deliver his own address to the UN general assembly , and represented the most serious diplomatic fallout to date from the revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden .
Rousseff had already put off a planned visit to Washington in protest at US spying , after NSA documents leaked by Snowden revealed that the US electronic eavesdropping agency had monitored the Brazilian president 's phone calls , as well as Brazilian embassies and spied on the state oil corporation , Petrobras . ""
Personal data of citizens was intercepted indiscriminately .
Corporate information â€ “ often of high economic and even strategic value â€ “ was at the centre of espionage activity . ""
Also , Brazilian diplomatic missions , among them the permanent mission to the UN and the office of the president of the republic itself , had their communications intercepted , "" Rousseff said , in a global rallying cry against what she portrayed as the overweening power of the US security apparatus .
"" Tampering in such a manner in the affairs of other countries is a breach of international law and is an affront of the principles that must guide the relations among them , especially among friendly nations .
A sovereign nation can never establish itself to the detriment of another sovereign nation .
The right to safety of citizens of one country can never be guaranteed by violating fundamental human rights of citizens of another country .
"" Washington 's efforts to smooth over Brazilian outrage over NSA espionage have so far been rebuffed by Rousseff , who has proposed that Brazil build its own internet infrastructure . ""
Friendly governments and societies that seek to build a true strategic partnership , as in our case , can not allow recurring illegal actions to take place as if they were normal .
They are unacceptable , "" she said .
"" The arguments that the illegal interception of information and data aims at protecting nations against terrorism can not be sustained .
Brazil , Mr President , knows how to protect itself .
We reject , fight and do not harbour terrorist groups , "" Rousseff said .
"" As many other Latin Americans , I fought against authoritarianism and censorship and I can not but defend , in an uncompromising fashion , the right to privacy of individuals and the sovereignty of my country , "" the Brazilian president said .
She was imprisoned and tortured for her role in a guerilla movement opposed to Brazil 's military dictatorship in the 1970s . ""
In the absence of the right to privacy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore no effective democracy .
In the absence of the respect for sovereignty , there is no basis for the relationship among nations . ""
Rousseff called on the UN oversee a new global legal system to govern the internet .
She said such multilateral mechanisms should guarantee the "" freedom of expression , privacy of the individual and respect for human rights "" and the "" neutrality of the network , guided only by technical and ethical criteria , rendering it inadmissible to restrict it for political , commercial , religious or any other purposes .
"" The time is ripe to create the conditions to prevent cyberspace from being used as a weapon of war , through espionage , sabotage and attacks against systems and infrastructure of other countries , "" the Brazilian president said .
As host to the UN headquarters , the US has been attacked from the general assembly many times in the past , but what made Rousseff 's denunciation all the more painful diplomatically was the fact that it was delivered on behalf of large , increasingly powerful and historically friendly state .
Obama , who followed Rousseff to the UN podium , acknowledged international alarm at the scale of NSA snooping revealed by Snowden .
He said : "" Just as we reviewed how we deploy our extraordinary military capabilities in a way that lives up to our ideals , we have begun to review the way that we gather intelligence , so as to properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies , with the privacy concerns that all people share . ""
Brazilian officials said that Washington had told them about this review but had noted that its results would not be known for months and that Rousseff believed it was urgent to raise the need for an international code of ethics for electronic espionage .
Rousseff will leave New York tomorrow without meeting Obama but Brazil 's new foreign minister , Luiz Alberto Figueiredo , will remain at the UN throughout the week and will meet his opposite number , John Kerry , Brazilian officials said , in an attempt to start mending the rift between the two countries ."
2013-10-15,"Dilma Rousseff , the Brazilian president , has reportedly developed a passion for hot bikes and heavy metal after going on an incognito jaunt around the capital , Brasilia , earlier this year , listening to AC / DC , Black Sabbath , U2 and Coldplay .
Despite the headaches for her security detail , that ride on the back of the social security minister 's bike on 4 August is reported to have been so thrilling that Rousseff , 65 , is now keen to get her own set of wheels .
The Folha do São Paulo newspaper reported on Monday that the president had asked social security minister Carlos Gabas to help her get a licence and suggest a model for her to buy .
According to the article , Gabas has photographed the machine he will recommend : a red , 833cc Harley - Davidson with a top speed of 107 mph and a weight of 260 kg .
Rousseff has no experience of riding a motorbike , but is confident of her ability to handle the machine .
"" I have ridden bicycles a lot .
I have good balance , "" she is quoted as saying .
The president 's office declined to confirm or deny the reports , which have caused a huge splash in Brazil .
But ahead of an election year , aides are said to be happy that the reception to the news has so far been positive and helped to add a more human side to the president 's otherwise technocratic image .
Rousseff would not be the first president on a motorbike .
The military dictator João Figueiredo is said to have worried his security personnel by riding off on his own while he was president in the early 1980s .
The Russian president , Vladimir Putin , has also donned leathers , jumped on a Harley - Davidson and ridden with a biker gang .
Rousseff 's security chief said his agents had followed the president on her ride in August from a discreet distance .
Mines and energy minister , Eidson Lobbão , was apparently shocked when Rousseff told him the news and he warned her that she had to take care for the sake of her daughter and 200 million Brazilians .
The president reportedly replied that she had never felt such a sense of freedom .
"" Life is full of dangers .
Everything in life entails risk , "" she said .
Apparently that did not include being found out . ""
With this helmet , no - one will recognise me , "" Rousseff was quoted as saying .
"" Even if they recognise me , they wo n't believe it . """

It is the first legislative step in a major diplomatic and technological push by Brazil to increase domestic cyber - security , reduce reliance on US servers and revise global governance of the internet in the wake of the NSA spying revelations .
The marco civil da internet â€ “ or civil rights framework for the internet â€ “ has been in the pipeline for more than a year , but it was fast - tracked by Rousseff in September after leaked documents from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed the US agency had been monitoring the president 's emails and phone calls , those of Brazil 's biggest oil company and the communications of millions of citizens .
Officials are haggling with legislators and telecom companies over last - minute amendments to the bill , which will only apply domestically but is likely to set several fundamental principles for the government 's international strategy
The marco civil was primarily intended to enshrine the rights of Brazil 's fast - growing community of internet users with provisions for net neutrality , privacy protection , open government , data storage guidelines and guarantees that platform providers should not be held liable for user content .
But , since the NSA scandal broke , the government has also pressed for an amendment that would oblige Facebook , Google and other foreign service providers to base servers inside Brazil .
This has proved controversial .
Critics say such a step would reduce efficiency and could lead to protectionism and a fragmentation of the internet .
Progress on the marco civil has also been held up by a dispute over net neutrality , under which internet providers are supposed to treat and set charges for all data equally .
Telecom companies are arguing for more scope on pricing but the government says the spying revelations make this too urgent to leave much longer .
"" We can not turn our backs because it is controversial .
This is particularly the case since the allegations of espionage , "" said the leader of the ruling party in the lower house , JosÃ © GuimarÃ£es .
"" This bill will not solve the problem , but it is a first step .
We must develop a new framework for a civil internet , with rights and duties .
"" The debate on the marco civil is scheduled to begin on Tuesday .
It is only a small part of the plans to make Brazil 's communications less vulnerable .
Rousseff , who is facing an election next year , has made internet security one of her priorities .
After the spying scandal broke in September , she called on the United Nations to revise internet governance and outlined her nation 's policy of "" cyber neutrality "" .
To further the debate , Rousseff announced an international conference on the subject which will be held in Rio de Janeiro early next year . ""
The current model of internet governance must evolve and requires institutional changes to ensure an internet that is stable , safe , transparent and democratic , "" Brazil 's communications ministry told the Guardian by email .
Along with the diplomacy , Brazil is developing its own software and beefing up its hardware .
Two weeks ago , Rousseff confirmed plans for a more secure email service via her twitter account , saying the move was necessary to "" prevent possible espionage "" .
The federal data processing service ( Serpro , by its Brazilian acronym ) is developing the system and will be the sole provider of email services for public officials .
"" This means that messages exchanged within the government network will be protected from external breaches since they do not fall into the open email network , "" the communications ministry said .
The proposed email service -â€ “ which was in the pipeline before the spying scandal , but has been accelerated as a result â€ “ will be available to the entire population , though it is unlikely to supplant the current market leader , gmail .
The government is also upgrading and expanding the country 's communications infrastructure to reduce its reliance on US data centres .
Currently , the bulk of internet and telephone data in Latin America passes through a single building in Miami , known as the network access point of the Americas .
Brazil is trying to divert more of its traffic elsewhere .
In recent years , it has laid fibre - optic submarine cables to Angola , which would strengthen direct links with African telecommunications hubs , and other cables are planned to Nigeria and other BRICS nations , which also include Russia , India , China and South Africa ) .
( the countries ' intials makign the acronym ) .
Brazil is also negotiating a 10,000 km "" optical ring "" that would directly link communications between 12 South American countries and Europe .
Some of the changes could affect the core infrastructure of the web .
"" I think what is at stake is to have more root servers in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America , "" said Ronaldo Lemos , director of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro .
"" There are currently root servers in the US , Europe and Sweden , with backups in Iceland , Spain and Australia .
But they are not that well distributed . ""
Speculation that the president may be lobbying to host root servers in Brazil increased last month when Rousseff met Fadi Chehade , the president of the internet 's governing body , Icann ( the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers ) .
The meeting with Icann â€ “ which is made up of representatives from private industry , national governments and civil society groups â€ “ appeared to be a departure from Brazil 's previously stated policy , which was for the United Nations to take greater control of internet .
Lemos said the president seemed to realise that it was better to diversify control than put an intergovernmental body in charge of the web . ""
Dilma seems to be moving more towards a multi - stakeholder approach .
I think that is a good change , "" he said .
The marco civil could send a different signal .
Although the bill has still not been finalised , Lemos , who drafted the original framework , is opposed to amendments that would force foreign companies to store data in Brazil .
Although these moves are designed to protect local users from having their data intercepted in the US , Lemos said such steps could lead to the internet becoming less efficient and more influenced by protectionist sentiment .
Other critics go further , warning that some of the proposed changes could lead to a partitioned internet .
Lemos , however , says Brazil 's policy is positive .
"" Brazil is not moving away from the internet , "" he said .
"" Putting in place new cables between BRICs and between Latin American countries , and buildings more internet exchange points reinforces the ideal of an open internet without a core . ""
Many of Brazil 's steps have been touted for years and were primarily driven by economic imperatives rather than security concerns .
But the scandals have created an ideal political climate for them to be accelerated .
"" Given the country 's fast - growing digital environment , Brazil 's proposal to build more internet exchange points and lay extra fibre - optic cable is long overdue , "" said Robert Muggah of the Rio de Janeiro - based IgarapÃ © Institute .
"" At the moment , there is both the political and technical capability to do so . ""
Jonatas Lucena , a SÃ£o Paulo - based lawyer who specialises in virtual crime , said Brazil was still a long way from ending its reliance on US technology and talent . ""
Today , we buy everything related to IT from the United States and we stand in the hands of its developers and , in turn , in the hands of the NSA . ""
The marco civil will not change that , but it will be a marker of the direction Brazil wants to take in its search for internet security and profits ."
2013-11-15,"Destruction of the Amazon rainforest has increased by almost one - third in the past year , reversing a decade - long trend of better protection for the world 's greatest rainforest .
Environmentalists blamed a controversial weakening of legal protections passed by President Dilma Rousseff for the increase in deforestation by loggers and farmers .
But the environment minister , Izabella Teixeira , rejected this , saying the overall trend was "" positive "" and that eliminating illegal deforestation remained the government 's goal .
The set - back in the Amazon came as the first global , high - resolution , satellite analysis of global deforestation revealed that since 2000 an area equal to 50 football pitches has been destroyed every minute .
The total loss is 10 times the area of the UK , with only a third being replaced by natural and planted reforestation , and the destruction is accelerating in the tropics .
The razing of forests is a major contributor to the emissions that drive climate change .
Trees provide a vital store of carbon , as well as providing livelihoods for a billion people .
But deforestation has more than doubled in Indonesia , Paraguay , Malaysia and Cambodia , largely due to illegal logging .
In the Amazon , the use of satellite data has helped the government slash deforestation by 80 % since 2003 - 4 by allowing police to pinpoint illegal activity in the vast forest , which is bigger than western Europe .
But the 5,800km2 in 2012 - 13 was a 28 % increase on the record - low in the previous year .
Paulo Adario , leader of Greenpeace 's Amazon campaign , said the spike was scandalous : "" The government ca n't be surprised by this increase in deforestation , given that their own action is what 's pushing it .
The change in the Forest Code and the resulting amnesty for those who illegally felled the forest sent the message that such crimes have no consequences . ""
The revised Forest Code was passed in 2012 after more than a decade of efforts by Brazil 's powerful agricultural lobby .
The changes eased restrictions for smaller landowners , allowing them to clear land closer to riverbanks , and allowed those who had illegally felled land to not face penalties if they signed an agreement to replant trees , which many environmentalists say is unlikely to be enforced .
Adario added that the push by Rousseff government 's for infrastructure projects in the Amazon region was also a cause , noting that much of the recent destruction was along a government - improved highway running through Para and Mato Grosso states , which eases the transport of illegal timber .
Another factor is high global food prices which drives forest clearance for cattle and soya farming .
"" There are various ways to spin this figure , but there 's no way it 's good news , "" said Dr Doug Boucher , an expert on tropical forests at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
"" Certainly the amendments to the Forest Code were one reason .
It 's a warning that although deforestation can be reduced rapidly and dramatically by strong policies , it can also increase again when those policies are weakened . ""
Brazil has demanded funding from rich nation 's to cut deforestation and has been sensitive to criticism of its effort to develop and improve the living standards of its 200 million people .
In 2009 , the then president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva said : "" I do n't want any gringo asking us to let an Amazon resident die of hunger under a tree .
We want to preserve , but they will have to pay the price for this preservation because we never destroyed our forest like they mowed theirs down a century ago .
"" About three - quarters of Brazil 's emissions come from rainforest clearing , as trees are burned or felled and rot , making the nation the world 's sixth - biggest emitter of the carbon dioxide .
The new global satellite study shows that Indonesia , despite being just a quarter of the size of Brazil , now destroys about the same area of forest . ""
Recent progress has been made with Indonesia 's forest moratorium , which prevents new licenses to clear primary forest , but it suffers enforcement challenges , "" said Prof Matt Hansen , at the University of Maryland , who led the global satellite study with Google and other researchers .
"" It 's too early to tell if the moratorium has actually reduced forest loss . ""
Hansen said "" timely "" annual updates of global deforestation will start in early 2014 : "" Prior to this , most information about forests is years out - of - date by the time it finds its way into policymakers ' hands . """
2014-01-22,"The Fifa secretary general , JÃ © rÃ´me Valcke , has given a four - week ultimatum to one of Brazil 's World Cup host cities to accelerate stadium construction or risk being excluded from the tournament .
With less than five months until kick - off , the Arena da Baixada in Curitiba is so far behind schedule that organisers admit it will not be ready for its first match on 16 June at the current speed of work .
It is one of six stadiums that missed Fifa 's deadline for completion , and the delay is likely to figure prominently in talks that the Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , will hold on Thursday in Zurich with Sepp Blatter .
After a site visit to Curitiba on Tuesday , Valcke said work at the Arena da Baixada stadium was "" delicate "" and far behind schedule .
He added : "" To be very honest , the situation as it stands is not ideal .
The stadium is very delayed and well outside the delivery schedule to ensure best use by Fifa and the Fifa World Cup . ""
In a new effort to push the work forward , he announced the creation of a steering and technical committee , comprising representatives from world football 's governing body , local officials and Clube AtlÃ © tico Paranaense that will issue daily progress reports .
More workers will be brought on site and a third shift will be introduced to speed up construction .
The Parana government has promised to put up an extra 39 m reals ( Â£10 m ) to pay for the increased workforce .
By 18 February , Valcke said all parties have to decide "" whether the stadium is in a position on that date to give us the confidence to hold World Cup matches there , without risking the organisation of the event "" .
Brazilian officials acknowledge completion is still some way off .
LuÃ­s Fernandes , the executive secretary of Brazil 's Ministry of Sport , said : "" What all sides have found is that , if the pace of work at the stadium in Curitiba were to be kept as it is , then it would not be ready with the quality and requirements necessary to host the Fifa World Cup . ""
Though it must still be considered a remote possibility , a change of stadium and schedule so close to the opening match of the tournament on 12 June would be a nightmare for organisers .
Arena da Baixada is due to stage four matches : Spain v Australia , Honduras v Ecuador , Iran v Nigeria and Algeria v Russia .
Tens of thousands of fans have already bought tickets and millions of dollars are likely to have been spent on flight and hotel reservations .
National teams will need time to organise training camps .
It is also far from certain that an alternative stadium could be prepared to meet Fifa standards at such short notice .
Curitiba is not the only problem .
Valcke has also visited SÃ£o Paulo 's ItaquerÃ£o stadium , which fell further behind schedule after a fatal accident in November .
Local organisers said the stadium would be inaugurated on 15 April , less than two months before it is due to stage the opening match of the World Cup .
Labour unions warned safety standards are being compromised as a result of a last - minute rush after two other workers were killed in December at a stadium in Manaus that is also still incomplete .
All World Cup stadiums were supposed to be finished by the end of December .
Earlier this month , Blatter said no host nation has been so far behind in his tenure .
He and Rousseff will be looking to put on a more united front after their meeting on Thursday .
Rousseff , who is in Switzerland for the Davos World Economic Forum , and the Minister of Sports , Aldo Rebelo , have been invited to the FIFA headquarters for a "" courtesy meeting "" .
They are expected to discuss preparations , including how they plan to address the delays and concerns about a repeat of the protests that marred last year 's Confederations Cup .
In better news for the organisers , the Arena das Dunas stadium in Natal will be declared officially open next week and ticket sales for the tournament as a whole are on course for a record ."

2014-02-09,""" The greatest change in Brazil since the right to vote was the election of a woman president , "" says the country 's culture minister , Marta Suplicy , referring to the appointment of Dilma Rousseff in 2010 , the first woman to hold the position .
"" As soon as she took power , the changes began .
She made me vice - president of the Senate – another first for Brazilian women – and appointed more women in her cabinet than ever before .
I could see that private enterprises also started to think around that time that it was a good idea to have more women on their boards of directors . ""
Dilma later appointed Maria das Graças Silva Foster as head of Petrobras , Brazil 's state oil firm , and increasingly geared government policies towards supporting women , particularly in poor and black communities where gender inequality is most pronounced .
This should start to make a long - term difference , says Suplicy , who sees encouraging signs of change among the young . ""
After Dilma was elected , girls started playing in ways they did n't before .
I took my granddaughter to the Senate ahead of the inauguration .
Someone asked her , ' What do you want to be when you grow up ? '
She replied , ' President of Brazil . '
I would never hear that when I was 10 .
Now I see more imagination and ambition in the play of young girls .
It all starts with the games they play – not the princess waiting for a guy on a white horse , but an accomplished person who is capable of succeeding . ""
Suplicy , a former mayor of São Paulo , has for many years been one of the country 's strongest advocates of equal representation .
A recent UN study ranked Brazil 116th out of 143 countries in terms of the proportion of women in the national legislature and efforts to remedy this with a quota system – such as those adopted by neighbouring Argentina and Bolivia – have made little headway , despite Suplicy 's heavy campaigning .
In local politics , the situation is a little better .
Quotas for women candidates on party lists have been established at a municipal level .
Suplicy , who was one of the authors of this policy , says this is a step forward .
"" It was important .
Mainly in poor areas , women work very hard in politics , but they did n't put themselves forward .
They were still serving coffee while the guy gets elected .
I think the law opened opportunities . ""
At a national level , women are also often reluctant to stand , Suplicy says , because it would require them to spend most of their time in Brasilia , far away from their homes .
This still runs against the grain of social expectations .
"" If a man runs as a federal deputy , his wife stays at home .
She is resigned to that .
But if the opposite is true , the guy gets very upset that his wife is not there to prepare lunch and take the kids to school , even if they have a maid .
That makes things very difficult .
Most of my colleagues are either divorced or married to politicians . ""
Suplicy , who is twice divorced , says her interest in gender issues started in childhood .
"" I was the eldest of three daughters and one son .
I could see my younger brother had privileges that I as a girl did not .
Also I could see my mother , who was very bright , did n't go to work .
I did n't want to be like her .
I wanted the world to change .
"" She has done more than most to make that happen .
A psychoanalyst by training , Suplicy rose to fame with a popular TV show offering sexual advice called TV Mulher ( Woman TV ) .
It helped to transform attitudes , which were extremely conservative . ""
In the 1980s , I gave a lecture in the north of Brazil to a psychology department .
One member of the audience asked an interesting question so I asked my host if she could join us for dinner afterwards . '
Better not , ' he replied .
When I asked why , the answer was , ' Because she is a divorced woman . ' ""
To drive change further forward , the culture minister believes the best vehicle for social transformation is the telenovela , Brazil 's immensely popular and influential form of TV soap opera .
"" Most writers for soaps in Brazil are gay .
They are excellent writers and they have pushed the gay rights movement forward by highlighting [ in their plots ] the provocations suffered by gay people in recent years , "" notes Suplicy , who has also been a champion of LGBT rights in parliament .
"" But I have n't seen any effort to understand contemporary women and push them forward [ in the telenovelas ] .
Most women 's roles are traditional .
I 'm sorry soap operas do n't pick this issue up , "" she adds .
"" That would do more than any speech I can make in the Senate . """
2014-02-16,"Another week , another storm of teargas and rubber bullets at a World Cup host city in Brazil .
This time , the clashes were in the capital , BrasÃ­lia , where 15,000 protesters from the Landless Workers Movement marched from the ManÃ © Garrincha football stadium to the PalÃ¡cio do Planalto state office of the president , Dilma Rousseff .
Riot police using batons and teargas fought off several attempts to invade the building .
The demonstrators threw stones and tore down railings which they used as weapons .
In the fierce fighting , 12 protesters and 30 police officers were injured .
Rousseff was not in her office at the time , but this latest explosion of unrest is yet another headache for the president in what is supposed to be one of the most triumphant , feelgood years in the nation 's history .
Hosting the World Cup was intended to show that Brazil â€ “ the land long condemned as the "" country of the future â€ “ and always will be "" â€ “ had finally arrived .
It seemed a shoo - in for success .
The five World Cup wins of the SeleÃ§Ã£o , the national football team , are arguably the greatest source of national pride among the 200 million population .
Sure , given the nation 's laidback lifestyle , there were always bound to be a few glitches along the way , but it was taken as a given that the land of carnival and samba would mark the tournament by throwing the best party ever .
Those glib assumptions have taken a battering in the last eight months , starting with the biggest street protest in a generation during last June 's Confederations Cup and rising in violent , nerve - jangling intensity to the point where â€ “ just four months from kick - off â€ “ people are still being killed in protests , workers are dying in the rush to complete unfinished stadiums and the mood of the nation is far closer to unease than alegrÃ­a â€ “ joy .
In the last month , the news has grown worse and the criticism sharper .
Five stadiums that were supposed to be ready at the end of December are still under construction , prompting panic among Fifa 's executives .
Last month , its president , Sepp Blatter , said Brazil was further behind schedule than any host since he joined Fifa in 1975 , even though it has had the most time to prepare .
One stadium â€ “ the Arena da Baixada in Curitiba â€
“ is now in the last - chance saloon .
Organisers in the city have two days left to prove they have accelerated the pace of building or the Fifa secretary general ,
JÃ © rÃ´me Valcke , has warned the venue could be kicked out of the cup .
That is almost unthinkable given the logistical nightmare of finding a new venue at this late stage , but the fact that the matter was even raised in public underscores the frustrations the delays have generated .
The dire progress is also at least partly to blame for several deaths .
Of the six workers who have been killed in stadium construction accidents , four have lost their lives since late November as the deadline pressure picked up .
The latest casualty , AntÃ´nio JosÃ © Pita Martins , was crushed last week in Arena da AmazÃ´nia in Manaus , where three people have died preparing the stadium where England will play their opening match against Italy .
With no major domestic league teams in the city , the venue is thought unlikely to be filled again for football after July .
The waste of lives and money on such white elephants has added fuel to the anger on the streets .
Initially public protests had nothing to do with football .
Until last June , most were small , relatively peaceful and focused on single issues such as bus fares , healthcare , evictions and corruption .
But Fifa 's mega - events have become a lightning rod for these and many other issues . ""
NÃ£o vai ter Copa ! ""
( No World Cup ) is now a popular chant at almost every rally .
Violence is a growing problem .
Although demonstrations are far smaller than last June , they are often bloodier .
The most recent victim was a TV cameraman , Santiago Andrade , who was killed when a protester 's flare exploded next to his head during a protest outside the Central do Brasil railway station in Rio de Janeiro .
Police brutality has only added to the problem , both on the streets and in the favelas , where a "" pacification "" programme aimed at driving out armed gangs has suffered a series of setbacks .
Residents ' support for the operation has weakened since the torture and murder of a local man , Amarildo de Souza , by police last year .
His home â€ “ the Rocinha favela , which sits above the England team 's hotel â€ “ is now racked by gunfire almost every night .
Elsewhere , Comando Vermelho gangsters have assassinated several police officers in what appears to be a resumption of tit - for - tat killings .
Football offers a far from safe refuge .
More people die in stadium violence and supporter clashes in Brazil than in any other country .
Players are no more immune and only slightly better protected .
This was evident in the attack this month on the Corinthians training camp in SÃ£o Paulo by about 100 angry fans who made a hole in the fence with wirecutters , then assaulted the team .
Peruvian striker Paolo Guerrero , who scored the winner against Chelsea in the 2012 Club World Cup final , was throttled .
Others had belongings stolen .
The players have threatened to go on strike over the lack of safety , which will also be a concern at the World Cup , when Iran will use the same training facility .
For some analysts , such problems highlight the fundamentally disruptive and unhealthy impact of global tournaments , despite the promises of improvements .
"" What we are seeing in Brazil is an aggravation of ordinary living conditions as cities prepare for the World Cup .
Traffic is worse , prices are higher and there has never been any kind of institutional reform to Brazilian football .
Violence is a part of daily life in Brazil and to assume that this will go away because people feel good about the World Cup is as irresponsible as it is naive , "" said Christopher Gaffney , a visiting geography professor at the Fluminense Federal University in Rio de Janeiro .
Others , however , dismiss such views as curmudgeonly .
Fifa 's ambassador , PelÃ © , insists the tournaments will bring rewards for Brazil â€ “ as long as people do n't ruin the party mood . ""
Now we have three fantastic events : the Confederations Cup , the World Cup and the Olympics .
The country can fill up with tourists and receive all the benefits from the tourists .
And Brazil 's own people are spoiling the party , "" he said in a recent interview .
"" I hope that people have good sense : let the World Cup pass on .
Then we 'll make up for the politicians who are robbing or diverting .
This is another thing .
Football only brings foreign money and only brings benefits to Brazil . ""
But King PelÃ © â€ “ as he was known on the pitch â€ “ has lost a great deal of respect among the public for an approach that comes across as a blind defence of anything that threatens his many corporate sponsors .
Similar appeals last year only brought disdain .
Rousseff has also stepped up the PR drive , according to local media who cite unnamed aides as saying that the president 's team plans an advertising campaign to remind people that infrastructure projects have been accelerated by the tournament and are partly funded by private money .
The president â€ “ who faces elections in October â€ “ has declared that the remaining obstacles to the World Cup are simple to overcome .
But with huge delays over airport and underground rail projects and suspicions of overly cosy ties between politicians and construction companies , there also appears to be a shift of emphasis away from the hardware and preparations and towards the soft side of the tournament as a great spectacle and a great party .
The new mantra â€ “ constantly repeated this year by the president and Fifa 's Valcke â€ “ is that 2014 will be the "" Copa das Copas "" ( Cup of Cups ) .
It is , of course , not too late for the tournament to be a success .
The country remains on an upward , if somewhat wobbly trajectory .
Jitters are normal before any big event and every hiccup is magnified by the unusually intense scrutiny of the global media .
Past mega - events have all been plagued by negative news â€ “ Tibetan protests before the Beijing Olympics in 2008 , crime fears before the South African World Cup in 2010 , security concerns before the London Games of 2012 .
Brazil , it is hoped , will also overcome its current hitches once the focus is on what it is good at : football rather than organisation .
But for the moment , there is still a gap between how the event is seen by the politicians in the futuristic but old buildings of BrasÃ­lia and how it is perceived on the streets .
A lot of work needs to be done to unify these two visions and time is not on Brazil 's side .
"" This is a moment of unrest and uncertainty â€ “ both in terms of the cup and also society , "" the 1970 World Cup winner and social commentator TostÃ£o told the Observer . ""
The cup will happen .
That 's certain .
There is no way they will let it not happen .
But what is success ?
For the Brazilian people , the cup meant lots of public spending , a lack of lasting infrastructure , a lack of social projects , but for the government a successful cup means something completely different .
We 're all in doubt right now because we just do n't know what 's going to happen during the cup . ""

In the editing process it was wrongly stated that the Brazilian president was male .
This has been corrected ."
2014-04-15,"Brazil 's most successful environmental campaigner , Marina Silva , has confirmed she will ally herself with a rival to the president , Dilma Rousseff , in the presidential election campaign later this year .
Silva announced on Monday that she would stand as the running mate of Eduardo Campos , the governor of Pernambuco , in an attempt to unseat a president who has been criticised for a sluggish economy , delayed World Cup preparations and a retreat on efforts to protect the Amazon .
The alliance of the two popular politicians under the banner of the Brazilian Socialist party threatens to erode the leftwing vote that has kept the ruling Workers ' party in power since 2003 .
Rousseff is still ahead in opinion polls , but her popularity is slipping .
A Datafolha poll last week showed support for the president had fallen six percentage points since February to 38 % .
The conservative candidate Aécio Neves was second with 16 % , while Campos was third with 10 % .
If no one secures an absolute majority in the first round of elections on 5 October , there will be a run - off between the two leading candidates three weeks later .
During the last presidential election in 2010 , Silva – a former environment minister who was then standing for the Green party – emerged as the strongest challenger to Rousseff with 19 million votes .
She remains popular today as a symbol of a clean , green politics sharply at odds with the corruption and waste that sparked huge street protests last year .
Silva was unable to establish her own party – the Sustainability Network – after a nationwide petition drive last year to secure the necessary signatures was controversially struck down by the electoral court .
To widespread surprise , she teamed up with Campos a few months later , but it was uncertain until recently which of them would run for president .
Although Silva polls higher than her new political partner , she has now agreed to stand in the junior position of vice - president .
They form a somewhat odd couple .
Campos is a political blue - blood whose grandfather was state governor of Pernambuco before him .
Silva , on the other hand , is one of 11 children from a poor rubber - tappers family who worked as a maid before entering university and becoming involved in trade unions .
Both though are former ministers who served in Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 's administration and who have grown disillusioned with the way the country has been managed , particularly since Rousseff replaced Lula in 2010 .
Launching their campaign ticket , Campos said : "" After three years , Brazil has come to a halt , the Brazilian people have lost hope , and the world has become disenchanted with us . ""
Silva said their partnership aimed to break the polarised politics of the past .
"" This is a historic re - alignment , burying once and for all the old republic , "" she told a gathering of supporters .
How much of a change this represents remains to be seen .
Despite its name , the Socialist party – which also includes the former footballer Romário among its members – is a centrist pro - business grouping that is expected to cut public spending and red tape , while keeping in place popular social welfare policies such as bolsa família .
Critics say the alliance is a more about political pragmatism with the two very different candidates hoping to draw voters that they would not normally appeal to .
For the moment , the election remains Rousseff 's to lose .
But with the campaign proper yet to start , the situation could change rapidly if inflation creeps higher , the economy slows or the World Cup is marred by protests and disruption .
In that eventuality , there is even speculation that Lula might make a return .
Though a distant prospect , that would be another game changer .
Silva and Campos both served under the former president and are careful not to criticise his policies even today .
Were Lula to stand , their alliance would be tested .

This article was amended on 17 April 2014 .
The earlier version said Marina Silva and Eduardo Campos were both former members of the Workers ' party ; both served as ministers in the Lula administration and Silva was in the Workers ' party at the time , but Campos was not ."
2014-05-08,"SELEÃ‡TING THE SELEÃ‡ÃƒO
Things are looking up in Brazil !
Later this week , the country 's president Dilma Rousseff is expected to open the new Itaquerao stadium in SÃ£o Paolo .
The party will continue in Curitiba a few days later when the Arena da Baixada will be opened by Ã€ Senhora Rousseff hoofing a ball off the centre spot .
The celebrations mean that there will be a pitch , with most of a building around it and perhaps even a bench and a dressing room .
Hurrah !
But despite the clear success of delivering turf , goalposts and white lines , Brazil 's preparations for the World Cup have been inducing palpitations among Fifa 's blazers who seem to feel that the hosts ' determination to work to their own timetable rather than that of a bunch of suits on a different continent is not quite on .
Forced to take their faces out of the buffet and give their South American cousins a hand , many Fifa gourmands have utterly freaked out at the prospect of having to do some work towards the four - yearly beano that swelled their coffers to the tune of $ 631 m in South Africa . ""
The fact is , we 've been through hell , "" wept Fifa deputy honcho Po ' JÃ
© rÃ´me Valcke , wiping traces of sausage meat sweats from his brow and attempting to locate his office , desk , computer and telephone in the hollowed - out volcano that serves as Fifa 's Zurich HQ .
But after the klaxon for brunch sounded , he decided that he may as well just accept whatever stadium the Brazilians have managed .
It was Wagyu Wednesday after all , and those burritos were n't going to eat themselves .
"" I 'm not saying everything will be finished .
But when it comes to the stadiums â€ ¦ having reduced our expectations and our needs , we 'll have what is necessary , "" he cheered over the din of the stampede heading towards the canteen .
Having successfully goaded Fifa , Brazil has now turned its attentions to trolling Liverpool , overlooking Lucas Leiva and Philippe Coutinho in their World Cup squad , perhaps deciding that the latter 's untimely role in the match against Crystal Palace ( 3 - 0 up with 12 minutes to go when he came on , 3 - 3 and out of the title race 10 minutes later ) was something they could do without .
Lucas Moura , Robinho and KakÃ ¡ will also have the opportunity to enjoy some Me Time this summer , while
Manchester City and Everton favourite JÃ ´ cavorts about in gold and blue .
The Brazil squad for the 2014 World Cup looks like this : JÃºlio CÃ © sar ( Toronto FC ) , JÃ © fferson ( Botafogo ) , Victor ( GrÃªmio ) , Dani Alves ( Barcelona ) , Maicon ( Internazionale ) , Marcelo ( Real Madrid ) , Maxwell ( PSG ) , David Luiz ( Chelsea ) , Thiago Silva ( PSG ) , Dante ( Bayern Munich ) , Henrique ( Napoli ) , Luiz Gustavo ( Wolfsburg ) , Paulinho ( Tottenham ) , Ramires ( Chelsea ) , Fernandinho ( Manchester City ) , O FiverÃ£o ( Fiver Towers ) , Oscar ( Chelsea ) , Willian ( Chelsea ) , Hernanes ( Internazionale ) , Bernard ( Shakhtar Donetsk ) , Fred ( Fluminense ) , Neymar ( Barcelona ) , Hulk ( Zenit St Petersburg ) , JÃ ´
( AtlÃ © tico Mineiro ) .
Bystanders have been quick to throw their hands into the air and cry hot , salty tears at a flair - free(ish ) squad including defenders , defensive midfielders and David Luiz , and have decried this as Boring Brazil
â€ “ without noticing that this is largely the same Boring Brazil that won the Confederations Cup last year with 17 of the 23 players they named on Wednesday .
The same boring , defensive Brazil who won the 1958 World Cup ( no goals conceded until the semi - final ) , the 1962 World Cup ( wingers like Mario Zagallo tucking into midfield ) , and the 1994 World Cup ( with defensive midfielders Dunga and Mauro Gomes at their heart ) , and the 2002 World Cup ( playing a 5 - 3 - 2 formation in the final with a midfield of Gilberto Silva and , erm , KlÃ © berson ) .
Boring old Brazil .
It was only the 1970 team that achieved World Cup glory with a cavalier , have at 'em style and even that one played with two deep - lying central ball - winners while PelÃ © and TostÃ£o dropped into midfield .
So when manager Big Phil Scolari sniffed , "" We know that not everybody will agree with all the names , it 's normal "" , it was clear he did so without giving a solitary , flying one .
Because he knows that it would be a fool who would bet against this side dancing about the MaracanÃ£ with a trophy above their heads come 13 July , even if elsewhere stadiums crumble and Wagyu beef burritos are choked on in disbelief .

THE JOURNEY SOUTH AND ROY CHUBBY BROWN ALTERNATIVE ENGLAND WORLD CUP SONG BANDWAGON .
LOOK AT THOSE CROWDS !"
2014-06-04,
2014-06-18,"The opening ceremony was almost a week ago but it continues to throw up controversy .
Reports are emerging of an on - field protest by a boy from the Guarani indigenous group , who unfurled a banner reading â€œDemarcation Now!â€ � in the centre circle as match officials and players were waiting to kick off .
JeguakÃ ¡
Mirim displayed his message for land rights after releasing white doves as part of the ceremony , which was attended by the Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff .
TV viewers , however , did not see the protest because editors cut away from it .
Mexican drug trafficker netted by Brazilâ€ ™ s police Brazilâ€
™ s police have bigger fish to fry than British touts .
On Monday night , they arrested a suspected Mexican drug trafficker at Rio de Janeiro airport as he waited to board a plane to Fortaleza for Tuesdayâ€ ™ s game against Brazil .
JosÃ © Diaz Barajas , who is on Interpolâ€ ™ s wanted list for smuggling methamphetamine to the US , was reportedly under surveillance since he crossed the border from Paraguay on 11 June .
Police said they held back to see if he planned drug deals in Brazil but swooped when it became clear he was only here for the football .
Japanese fans praised for â€˜non - profitâ€ ™ ticket resale Following admiration for their litter - collecting exploits , Japanese fans continue to be the darlings of the Brazilian media for selling unused match tickets at below face value .
The Folha de SÃ£o Paulo newspaper reports that Blue Samurai supporters are asking $ 130 for category - one seats that Fifa values at $ 350 .
This may simply be because it is difficult to find a buyer for Thursdayâ€ ™ s Japan versus Greece Group C game at the EstÃ¡dio das Dunas in Natal , but the report notes admiringly that the sellers from Tokyo are â€œnot trying to profitâ€ � .
British tout arrested after selling from hotel door
In contrast , UK touts appear to be trying to rake in as much as they can from this World Cup with understandably less sympathy from their hosts .
A British man has been detained by tourist police in Rio de Janeiro for trying to sell 59 tickets from the door of his hotel .
It is not known how much he was charging , but the Diary wonders whether the arrested man was one of the touts with a London accent who were asking double and triple face value for the Argentina versus Bosnia match on Sunday at the MaracanÃ£."
2014-07-06,"High in the hills of TeresÃ³polis , behind the police cordons and the backdrop of the RegiÃ£o Serrana , there was the sense of a team trying to show everything was OK , even if they might not actually believe itthemselves .
The president , Dilma Rousseff , had sent her condolences .
PelÃ © , Ronaldo and various football royalty had joined in the grieving process .
Now , in a windy marquee at Granja Comary , two players sat on white plastic chairs and tried to convince us that Brazil without Neymar did not have to be a car without petrol .
They had their work cut out when , back at Copacabana , the sand sculptors had already turned Neymarâ€ ™ s happy face into a sad one and Luiz Felipe Scolari was telling Marca that it was a â€œcatastropheâ€ � for Brazil to lose their No10 .
â€œNeymar is our benchmark .
He is our reference because he always makes the difference .
We have lost the one player we did not want to lose.â€ �
Yet Brazil are not going to get past Germany in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s semi - final by feeling sorry for themselves and that is why they brought out Willian and Bernard , the two players vying for Neymarâ€ ™ s place , to make their case that this team are still breathing .
But it was difficult .
One of the first Brazilian journalists to raise his hand asked how a team with â€œNeymar - dependenceâ€ � could possibly get by without him .
Bernard , the player Scolari has described as having â€œjoy in the legsâ€ � , was reminded of something he had said before the tournament , about the default setting of every player being to look for Neymar , every single time .
In half an hour of questions , Neymar was referenced , every single time .
â€œItâ€
™ s always going to be a weight , â€ �
Bernard said about the possibility of taking his place .
It culminated in a question to Willian about whether the team would be seeing a psychologist to help get over their loss .
Willian nodded .
He expected there would be a group conversation after dinner .
The Chelsea player is the more likely choice , to the point that he was also asked about being nicknamed the â€œnew Amarildoâ€ � , after the player who took over from the injured PelÃ © in 1962 .
Willian looked a little taken aback by that
but , if playing the role of not - Neymar requires competitive courage , he does not look short of it .
Willian missed one of the penalties in the shootout against Chile and , briefly , â€œlost itâ€ � on the pitch .
And now ? â€œIf there was another penalty shootout today , I would still raise my hand and go for it ,
definitely.â€ �
By his own admission , however , he would not be a like - for - like replacement .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no comparing us .
We have different styles .
Yes , some things are similar , such as our speed and dribbling , but Neymar is a striker whereas I am more a midfielder who sets up others .
Neymar scores a lot of goals , whereas I am more someone who serves my team - mates.â€
�
The thinking is that Willian could come in on the right side , with Oscar moving into the more central Neymar role , but the two interchanging positions in the way that is often seen at Stamford Bridge .
â€œWe played a lot together last season at Chelsea , â€ � Willian said .
â€œWe were free to move around and we are very familiar with each otherâ€ ™ s games .
If Scolari does choose me , it wonâ€
™ t be a problem for us because we have had a year of playing together.â€
�
All that really can be said for certain is that Brazil can not mope any longer .
â€œWe have to be prepared , â€ �
Bernard said .
â€œWe are all very sad but we have to overcome it .
This is a World Cup semi - final and the players have to be prepared , psychologically and emotionally .
â€œWe have lots of other good players and we can still beat Germany and be the champions.â€ �
On the steep , winding roads into TeresÃ³polis , past Dedo de Deus ( Godâ€ ™ s Finger ) , Agulha do Diabo ( Devilâ€ ™ s Needle ) and the other peaks that make this Brazilâ€ ™ s mountain - climbing capital , the entrance to their training ground is dominated by a model â€ “ for no apparent reason â€ “ of the Incredible Hulk breaking out of his shirt .
What Brazil need now is for the real - life Hulk to turn more of his chances into goals .
Or for Fred , their increasingly maligned striker , to do something that can change perceptions of him .
As it stands , Fred tends to be talked about in a mocking tone by Brazilâ€ ™ s media and public , and a sympathetic one whenever his team - mates are asked to explain his difficulties .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re looking for Fred on the pitch , trying to find him , â€ � Willian said .
â€œWe will keep on trying.â€ �
Where Brazil have made themselves look slightly desperate â€ “ or at least worried â€ “ is by lodging an official appeal with Fifa about the yellow card that Thiago Silva picked up in the quarter - final against Colombia , when he blocked David Ospina from taking a quick goal - kick .
That booking means Silva will be suspended against Germany and there is a separate , and legitimate , issue here about whether two yellow cards in five games justifies ruling someone out of a semi - final .
Brazilâ€ ™ s case , all the same , is as flimsy as cigarette paper .
Fifa do not entertain appeals for yellow cards unless there are outstanding circumstances , such as a case of mistaken identity , and that alone makes it fairly ludicrous if the fax from the ConfederaÃ§Ã£o Brasileira de Futebol is not directed to the nearest waste - paper basket .
Real Madrid tried , and failed , with a similar tactic after Xabi Alonso was ruled out of the Champions League final .
This one deserves the same outcome unless Fifa wants to look even more erratic than we already knew .
In Silvaâ€ ™ s absence , David Luiz will captain the team in Belo Horizonte .
As for Neymar â€ “ yes , it always comes back to him â€ “ Scolari reported how the Barcelona player had feared something even worse in the immediate moments after Juan ZÃºÃ±igaâ€ ™ s knee had rammed into his back .
â€œMarcelo ran up to Neymar and asked him how he was , â€ � the Brazil coach said .
â€œHe told him : â€˜I canâ€
™ t feel my legs.â€ ™
There was a lot of confusion .
It was a big shock , seeing Neymar being carried off on a stretcher , the pain he was in , the tears .
But he will be with us if he can [ against Germany ] , on the bench , or in the stands .
We have already asked him to do this .
If he can , I am certain he will be there.â€ �"
2014-07-13,"Reading like the lineup for the most bizarre dinner party in history or a random trawl through a celebrity website , Fifa ’s “ VVIP ” guest list for the World Cup final runs from the Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher to the Gabon president , Ali Bongo Ondimba .
Alongside those you might expect to be sitting with Fifa president Sepp Blatter , such as the Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , and Vladmir Putin , the president of the next World Cup hosts Russia , are some more esoteric choices .
Kutcher , best known as the former boyfriend of Demi Moore and star of Two and a Half Men , joins a random selection of former international players including Olivier Dacourt and Marco Materazzi and Fabio Cannavaro .
LeBron James , the most famous name in basketball , was also present , along with a motley collection of musical stars roped in for the closing ceremony –
Shakira ( now on her second World Cup theme tune ) , Wyclef Jean and Carlos Santana .
The only obvious reason for also inviting Daniel Craig was so that organisers could boast thatthey had secured both LeBron James and James Bond .
Carles Puyol and the supermodel Gisele made the cut by virtue of having been chosen to carry the World Cup on to the pitch in a specially made Louis Vuitton case , presumably as some sort of satire on Fifa opulence .
Other heads of state invited include the South African president , Jacob Zuma , Hungary ’s prime minister , Viktor Orban , and Gaston Brown , the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda .
Of course .
At least the presence of Placido Domingo is no surprise – a friend of Blatter ’s , to widespread incredulity he was once appointed to a short lived “ solutions committee ” to lead Fifa reform ."
2014-07-13,"As the sound of helicopters and the tang of teargas filled the air on the first day of a World Cup that had proved more divisive among its own people than any other , initial signs in Brazil were not promising .
Inside the security cordon at the barely finished Arena Corinthians , President Dilma Rousseff had promised a â€œCopa das
Copasâ€ �
â€ “ the Cup of Cups .
She left with obscene chants ringing in her ears as the national team needed the help of the referee to deliver an unconvincing victory .
But four weeks on , it is hard to argue Brazil has not delivered , even if Luiz Felipe Scolariâ€ ™ s emotional side ultimately came off the rails in spectacular fashion .
By the eve of the final the atmosphere was very different .
Tens of thousands of Argentinians mingled with Brazilians and international fans on Copacabana , drinking , dancing and singing .
Families in Brazil shirts waved Germany flags and makeshift bars sold endless beers and caipirinhas .
â€œWe showed that our people know how to have good interaction not only among ourselves but with the foreigners that we received , â€ � said Rousseff on the eve of the final .
â€œWe competently maintained peace and order , as well as having good airport administration , among other successes.â€
�
Rousseff , desperate for a successful tournament to boost her re - election chances in October , added :
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve eliminated the doubts of all who didnâ€ ™ t believe in us.â€
�
She was right : Brazil was an intoxicating and welcoming but not unquestioning host , providing the platform for a soul - stirring football feast .
Fears of transport chaos and operational dysfunction were unfounded .
But she was also wrong : the argument over whether $ 13.5bn of public money invested in the tournament was well spent in a country with many other pressing needs will continue long after the Fifa circus has left town .
That is particularly the case in places such as the Amazonian jungle destination of Manaus or the coastal city of Natal where new stadiums have no obvious sustainable use .
Across the vast country , road , rail and infrastructure projects that formed part of the rationale for holding the tournament in the first place lie unfinished .
How and why a tournament that was seven years in the planning was delivered with indecent haste is worthy of further debate , as are the evictions in host cities that displaced families in the name of progress .
The collapse of an overpass in Belo Horizonte , killing two people , was a reminder of the human cost of a last - minute construction dash that also cost the lives of eight workers battling to get the stadiums finished in time .
But judged on its own terms , Brazil delivered .
The stadiums were finished and full .
As is so often the case with increasingly overblown â€œmega eventsâ€ � , the unpaid volunteers recruited to deal with the public smoothed over many cracks .
Fans actually revelled in some of the rough edges .
The ongoing attempt to ensure a cookie - cutter experience for sponsors and hospitality guests has robbed the World Cup of its charm over decades .
But probably scared of a possible backlash , the branding from sponsors felt less overt here and the policing of Fifaâ€ ™ s â€œrightsâ€ � less draconian than at previous tournaments .
For many , the so - called â€œfan festsâ€ � remain airless experiences .
But the millions packing them under sunny skies in often stunning locations did not seem to care .
And at least they offered those unable to afford the often eye - watering ticket prices an opportunity to grab their slice of the ( heavily sponsored ) World Cup experience .
For the sponsors bounced into registering their concern over the corruption allegations washing over Fifa before the World Cup , it was largely business as usual .
And as is always the case with World Cups , particularly those blessed with a country with as many natural advantages as Brazil , it was the people who made the atmosphere and the football that dictated the mood .
Argentinian camper vans parked up along Copacabana , Chilean chants filled the night sky in SÃ£o Paulo , Mexicans flooded into Fortaleza and Costa Ricans set up camp in Salvador .
Rio was the melting pot for fans from around the world .
If Germany in 2006 felt like a good - natured , beer - drenched gathering of the European clans then Brazil was its equivalent for South and Central America .
The night that Colombia beat Uruguay and Brazil squeezed past Chile the streets of Rio became a huge impromptu party .
In the northern coastal cities of Fortaleza and Salvador , there was an abandon sometimes absent in the vast megalopolis of SÃ£o Paulo .
Huge tribes of American â€œOutlawsâ€ � , Colombians , Costa Ricans , Uruguayans , Mexicans and â€ “ most visibly â€ “ Argentinians slept on the beaches , on benches , in hostels and upmarket hotels .
They all went away with a better understanding of the country and it of them .
Whatever their underlying reservations about Fifa and their government , Brazilians welcomed them all with open arms .
While stadiums were full , the occupants of the seats excited much debate .
The Brazilians filling the seats were almost exclusively white and well off .
A poll taken at Brazilâ€ ™ s narrow victory over Chile by the Folha de S Paulo newspaper
found that 67 % of fans were white in a country where more than half the population describe themselves as black or mixed race .
Nine out of 10 came from Brazilâ€ ™ s top economic classes .
That is a pattern repeated at every major sporting event around the world .
But if Fifa is to make a virtue of taking its flagship event to new , fast - developing markets that have huge disparities between rich and poor , surely it is duty - bound to find better ways of allowing more people to experience the event they are ultimately paying for ?
Underpinning it all was an organising committee and a government desperate to pull off the first of two â€œmega eventsâ€ � in the space of two years and paddling furiously beneath the water .
Holding a World Cup and an Olympics back to back is unprecedented .
Attempting to do so in a country like Brazil , with its three layers of government and endemic corruption issues and social problems , is bound to create tension .
This vast , complex , engaging country is well capable of separating arguments about public - spending priorities from its attachment to the SeleÃ§Ã£o and the welcome it affords overseas visitors .
The Fifa president , Sepp Blatter , wisely kept his head down throughout and desperately hoped the dogged police investigation into a $ 100 m ticket - touting ring would not spiral into a major embarrassment .
It can sometimes feel like there are two Fifas .
One was on show the week before the tournament , when the discredited and dysfunctional executive committee sat onstage at Fifaâ€ ™ s Congress as corruption claims besieged the walls of a SÃ£o Paulo conference centre .
The other is the army of highly efficient staff who make sure the tournament runs smoothly .
The way they keep things running on the ground and package the World Cup for global consumption is impressive .
But it also creates its own problems .
Fifa has perfected the art of swooping in and creating a slick , temporary bubble in which the World Cup takes place .
But it then gathers up its $ 4bn in revenues from each World Cup cycle and moves on .
The host country is left counting up its white - elephant stadiums and counting the cost of the event .
The mass protests that occurred during the Confederations Cup were not repeated .
That was partly because the wider population put their concerns aside and resolved to enjoy the party .
But it was also because public areas were flooded with police and the military and because a range of worrying tactics were used to suppress protest .
Human rights groups registered concern that protest organisers and lawyers had been arrested and intimidated , while those who did manage to protest often found themselves facing heavy - handed policing involving the use of rubber bullets and teargas .
Public feelings towards the World Cup were bound up in underlying concerns about government corruption , the level of investment in public services and the quality of healthcare and education .
But they were also bound up in distaste , fermented over many years , not only for Fifa but for the men who run the sport in Brazil .
The hope is that defeat to Germany will act as a long - overdue catalyst for change .
It is not too melodramatic to say that the action on the pitch has rescued the World Cup as we know it , and perhaps even international football itself .
But Fifa and the Brazilian authorities should not be allowed to get away with using it to whitewash their deeper issues .
This World Cupâ€ ™
s
greatest legacy might be a wider movement behind the message scrawled on walls throughout Brazil : love football , hate Fifa .
And , by extension , much of the corporate machinery that surrounds modern football .
Paradoxically , given the big business around it and the political questions that framed it , this felt like a World Cup that brought home footballâ€ ™ s ability to unite and to provide moments of unexpected , unalloyed joy .
For that , Brazil deserves eternal thanks ."
2014-07-15,"Anyone daft enough to be looking at the MaracanÃ£â€ ™ s VVIP section â€ “ only Fifa could demand that extra V â€ “ rather than the pitch during the World Cup final would have seen Sepp Blatter deep in conversation with Vladimir Putin .
As the Fifa president turned away from Brazilâ€ ™ s Dilma Rousseff , with whom he had an uneasy relationship amid the troubled buildup to an ultimately successful tournament , the body language was pretty clear .
But it was also a reminder that eyes will soon turn to Russia and , beyond that , to the controversial destination of Qatar in 2022 .
Perhaps .
Whether and when that tournament takes place will be largely decided over the next few months based on the results of Michael Garciaâ€ ™ s investigation into the 2018/22 bidding process and â€ “ as ever â€ “ whatever works best for Blatter .
Collecting more than $ 4bn ( Â£2.3bn ) in revenues from this four - year cycle , which it argues is reinvested in football ( but also in Fifaâ€ ™ s sizeable salaries and operational budget ) , the World Cup is Fifaâ€ ™ s cash cow .
It is worth remembering that the 78-year - old Blatter began the tournament besieged by criticism from all sides over a new wave of corruption allegations surrounding the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments .
Cutting a swathe through gridlocked SÃ£o Paulo in his motorcade , he was angry with Uefa for saying that he should not stand for another term as president in 2015 having previously promised this would be his last .
He took out his frustration on the media , ranting against the â€œracismâ€ � of those he believed had an agenda against Fifa .
But by the time he was shrugging of the boos of the MaracanÃ£ crowd , Blatter was again looking younger than his years .
Fifaâ€ ™ s communications division followed a specific plan to keep Blatter out of the limelight in Brazil , not easy for a man who is drawn to a photo opportunity like a moth to a flame .
That meant keeping public utterances to a minimum and , where possible , avoiding appearing on camera in the stadiums in the knowledge that any fleeting glimpse would provoke a chorus of boos .
Blatterâ€ ™ s demeanour was that of a man both relieved the tournament had been a success and desperate to get away from a country that had become just one major headache among many over the past four years .
Brazilâ€ ™ s rambunctious media and public , not to mention a political class unafraid to challenge Fifa even while infected with its own corruption issues , made the marriage an uneasy one .
JÃ © rÃ´me Valcke , the Fifa secretary general charged with the task of delivering first a World Cup in South Africa and then one in Brazil , must now turn east for the third World Cup in a row targeted at a developing economy .
It might suit Blatterâ€ ™ s sense of destiny to conquer new lands , and it makes some commercial sense in terms of opening up new markets , but the logistics are challenging .
The endless cycle of new stadiums , new roads , new railways , new infrastructure might give the hosts a ( much - disputed ) Keynesian rationale for spending money on a World Cup .
Not to mention the opportunity for more people to make a cut .
But it also means more to potentially go wrong .
Dealings with Putinâ€ ™ s Russia are likely to be straightforward in comparison to Brazil â€ “ for obvious reasons there are unlikely to be mass street protests .
All that will suit Fifa just fine , even if handing the World Cup to regimes where free speech and a free press are not exactly welcomed raises its own issues .
â€œI will say something which is crazy , but less democracy is sometimes better for organising a World Cup , â€ � said Valcke in a revealing aside last year that says much about Fifaâ€ ™ s priorities .
It is fair to surmise that Fifa wonâ€ ™ t be losing too much sleep about how Russiaâ€ ™ s anti - gay laws and robust stance on suppressing protest will fit with its â€œhandshake for peaceâ€ � and anti - discrimination rhetoric .
But while there will be less civil unrest , and fewer concerns that the 2018 hosts wonâ€ ™ t build their stadiums on time , the bigger job might be selling the concept of a Russian World Cup to fans and sponsors .
Putin has already mandated a $ 20bn budget to build and renovate 10 stadiums that stretch from St Petersburg in the north to Sochi in the south and from Kaliningrad in the west to Ekaterinburg in the foothills of the Urals in the east .
There remain question marks over how Russia won the rights to the World Cup in the first place â€ “ though Vitaly Mutko , who led Russiaâ€ ™ s bid , and his chief executive Alexei Sorokin believe they have nothing to fear from Garciaâ€ ™ s investigation â€ “ and the usual logistical , transport and security considerations .
Yet while there were legitimate questions about corruption , human rights and the $ 51bn price tag before the most expensive Winter Olympics in history in Sochi , there was a feeding frenzy around the coverage that left Russian organisers furious and hurt .
With free train travel between cities , a promise to open up the country without a visa to anyone with a ticket and a commitment to showcase the diversity of the country there is every chance that the Russian World Cup will succeed .
Yet racism and violence in its domestic league are a serious concern , as is the underperformance of their own side .
Mutko suggested that their problems in domestic football should be considered separately from the World Cup .
â€œThe World Cup is something different
â€ “
we shouldnâ€ ™ t be confusing two things , mixing them up , â€ � he said .
â€œThe World Cup at large is a treasure to the whole world , we will open up Russia to 1 m fans who will come from all countries.â€ �
The Russian sports minister and Fifa executive committee member admitted it would be hard to replicate Brazilâ€ ™ s â€œfantasticâ€ � atmosphere .
But he said there was a genuine commitment to use the tournament to showcase another side of Russia â€ “ or at least the mostly European corner of the vast country where the tournament is being held .
â€œIt will be very difficult to replicate this fantastic atmosphere .
â€œWe would like to try and recreate something like this in Russia , â€ � said Mutko .
â€œOf
course we have infrastructural problems .
But we are a safe country .
All the cities are very interesting .
We have a vast cultural heritage .
And we recognise we will need to raise the benchmark in terms of general services.â€ �
As for Fifa , there are much more pressing concerns than Russia 2018 .
As Blatter plans his re - election campaign and the Uefa president , Michel Platini , tries to figure out a way to stop him , but remains unlikely to stand himself , everything is likely to be reflected through the prism of petty politicking .
Regardless of the problems piling up at the door of Fifaâ€ ™ s $ 100 m headquarters in Zurich , Blatter is likely to be a shoo - in for re - election given the scale of his support outside Europe .
As ever , the serious problems facing world football â€ “ racism , match fixing , third - party ownership of players imported into Europe in their thousands â€ “ will become mere pawns in a wider game .
So too will the open question of whether and when the Qatar World Cup will take place .
The 80-strong Qatar 2022 delegation in Brazil appeared paranoid and on edge but perhaps they are right to be , with Garciaâ€ ™ s verdict looming .
The Sunday Times allegations linking the Qatari former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam to payments made to football officials massively increased the pressure on their status as World Cup hosts .
Qatar has also promised to act to improve the conditions of migrant workers building the infrastructure that underpins its World Cup plans , following a series of reports in the Guardian and criticism from human rights organisations .
Like other issues facing Fifa pre - Brazil , Blatter shunted the question of when to announce the move to hosting the Qatar World Cup in winter by convening one of his much loved â€œtask forcesâ€ � .
He will now have to start providing some answers .
With work on the stadiums due to host the 2022 World Cup having begun , it is understood that organisers will resist any attempt to convene a re - vote through the courts .
Brazil offered a stark contrast between the often intoxicating fare on the pitch and in the host cities and the absurd Fifa protocol that preceded it .
At a reception in Manaus before the first match of Englandâ€ ™ s pitifully short campaign , FA chairman Greg Dyke offered a succinct appraisal of his first Fifa Congress .
â€œIt reminded me of certain things in Eastern Europe .
The idolisation of the leader .
I thought it was pathetic , personally .
I couldnâ€
™ t believe it , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œI think the cult of Blatter is pathetic .
I donâ€
™ t think itâ€ ™ s what it should be about.â€ � Until the man at the top changes , it is hard to see how Fifaâ€ ™ s culture will change .
And without a wholesale culture change , it will be hard to tackle some of those fundamental problems facing the game .
Meanwhile , the money - making World Cup bandwagon will roll on , leaving behind difficult questions over its legacy in Brazil and posing new ones for Fifa , Russia and , perhaps , Qatar ."
2014-09-17,"The brutalist headquarters of South America 's biggest company , Petrobras , offers a harsh riposte to those who try to romanticise Brazil as a land of golden beaches and endless forest .
This week , the concrete edifice in central Rio de Janeiro was the focus of a pro - oil rally by thousands of petrochemical workers amid a presidential election debate dominated by how to manage the nation 's vast fossil fuel reserves .
It is a question that has opened up the biggest gap between President Dilma Rousseff , an old industry champion of the Workers Party , and her main challenger Marina Silva , a former environment minister who has pledged to shift priorities towards alternatives energies like wind , solar and ethanol .
This is more than just a Brazilian rerun of George Bush and Big Oil versus Al Gore and climate concern , because state - run Petrobras is no ordinary company and – with the company also mired in a massive corruption scandal – this is no ordinary time .
On Wednesday , a former senior executive of the company , Roberto Costa , is due to testify that dozens of senior politicians received kickbacks from oil contracts as part of a scheme to buy votes .
According to local media , he has already told police that big contractors with Petrobras contributed a 3 % cut on contracts to campaign funds .
If his allegations are corroborated , the scale of the wrongdoing could dwarf the other major scandal of recent years – known as the Mensalão scandal – and further undermine the reputation of a company that has long been seen as a national treasure .
"" The scandal is really bad .
It 's bigger than anything else so far , bigger than Mensalão and will play to Silva 's advantage , "" said Heni Ozi Cukier , a professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas private university .
Petrobras is a pillar of the Brazilian economy , with production of 2.5 million barrels of oil per day , a near monopoly on petrol sales , 87,000 employees and control over the biggest oil deposits discovered in the world this century .
The company 's undersea drilling made Brazil self - sufficient in oil for the first time in 2006 .
In the following years , the company grew so fast that executives boasted they were on course to become the biggest firm in the world .
Its value has since fallen by half , but the company is as prominent as ever in the nation 's life .
As a state - controlled corporation , it is also a major source of funding for cultural events , hospitals and schools .
Nationalist pride and defensiveness often dwell on the company – as was evident last year in the widespread public outrage that followed allegations from the US
whistleblower Edward Snowden that Washington was spying on Petrobras .
"" Petrobras is a strong symbol for the Brazilian people , "" says Edmar Almeida of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro .
"" It is the largest company in the country , a success story of our engineering prowess , and a way to ensure that the nation keeps control of our oil and natural resources . ""
But the latest scandal has added to longstanding fears that the company is treated as a tool for politicians to reward loyalists and generate slush funds to buy off potential opponents .
With the government holding more than half of the shares , senior positions in the firm have long been allocated on party lines to supporters of the government ; and many of their decisions are questionable .
Petrobras lost billions of dollars on an oil refinery in Pernambuco and spent $ 1bn on a plant in Texas – signed off by Rousseff – that was sold on two years later at a markdown of 80 % .
Oil prices have been determined by political and social concerns .
Ordered by Rousseff to keep inflation down , Petrobras has been importing oil at about $ 100 per barrel and selling it at closer to $ 80 .
Shareholders are not happy .
The stock value of the company has almost halved since its offering in 2010 .
Back then , it was the fourth most highly valued company in the world .
Today it is 30th .
As a result , Petrobras has taken a central position in the election this year as all sides have tried to capitalise on the scandal .
"" I can not imagine that people can trust a party that – for 12 years – put in place a director to raid the coffers of Petrobras , "" Silva said at a speech in Rio last week that called for executives to be appointed by an independent search committee .
With a manifesto championing sustainable development , Silva has promised to resurrect ethanol – which has been damaged by oil subsidies – and put more emphasis on wind and solar .
Mindful of the popularity of plans to mine major "" sub - salt "" deposits buried deep under the floor of the ocean , she has promised to honour existing contracts and said oil will continue to play a key role in the economy .
But advisors say fuel taxes will rise .
After a spectacular surge in the polls , Silva looks almost certain to be in a runoff with Rousseff for the final vote on 25 October .
With the race still too close to call , the president 's camp have honed in on Petrobras policy as a potential vote - loser for Silva .
Rousseff has repeatedly alleged that her rival 's policies would hurt the nation 's biggest asset .
Her supporters claim the media attacks on Petrobras are part of an attempt to wrestle it back into private hands .
The pro - oil march this week , organised by the ruling Workers ' Party , resembled rallies in Venezuela , where employees of the nationalised petrol company are bussed in to support the government .
More than 1,000 people – many of them in workers ' overalls or red T - shirts – joined the demonstration , which was led by former Worker 's Party president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva .
Some chanted "" Viva Petrobras !
Viva Brasil ! "" .
Others carried banners declaring "" Defend Sub - Salt .
Defend Petrobras .
""
Many wore T - shirts bearing the image of Rousseff as a youthful guerrilla fighter .
Anti - Marina Silva badges were everywhere . ""
Sustainable development sounds nice , but alternative energy can supply only a fraction of our needs , "" lamented union activist and Workers Party supporter Francisco de Assis .
"" We must not delay investment in Petrobras .
Petroleum is essential for Brazil and the passport to the future for your youth .
It is a source of wealth and funding for health and education "" .
Dirty tricks are becoming more commonplace .
Some on the march claimed – without evidence – that Silva was being paid by the United States to undermine the competitiveness of Brazil 's biggest company .
Others said she wanted more private investment and less of a Petrobras monopoly , though this will play badly in Rio – the headquarters of the nation 's company , the stepping off point for pre - salt exploration and a key electoral battleground .
Ildo Sauer , who was gas and energy director at Petrobras under former president Lula but has since become critical of the way the company is run , believes the comparisons with the US election in 2000 are valid .
Rousseff , he says , is like Bush in her support for big companies , whereas Silva is like Gore trying to save the world .
But with Brazilian coalitions even harder to build than those in Washington and Petrobras playing such a central role in the national identity , he doubts that either candidate will achieve much of a change .
"" They both have almost a religious belief , a dogma about it .
But I do n't think they 'll be able to do what they want , "" he said ."
2014-10-02,"When challenger Marina Silva pulled ahead of incumbent Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff in the polls a few weeks ago there was a lot of excitement in the US business press , and Brazilian financial markets .
Rousseff ’s Workers’ party ( PT ) has been in power for 12 years , and a lot of rich and powerful people were ready for a change .
Fortune seemed to favour them : the Brazilian economy , having slowed considerably over the past few years , officially went into recession this year – something that would spell the end for many incumbent presidents .
Before that , there were street protests over the rising cost of public transport and government spending on the World Cup , and the event itself ended in disaster with a humiliating 7 - 1 defeat for the national team at the hands of Germany .
Yet Rousseff has bounced back from every blow , and now looks poised to come out on top in both the first and second rounds of the election .
How did this happen ?
If she is re - elected , it could be because the majority of Brazilians are looking at her party ’s 12-year record and , for those old or literate enough to remember , comparing this to the past .
For the vast majority , the changes are quite striking .
Despite the slowdown of the past few years , and the 2009 world recession , Brazil ’s GDP per person grew by an average of 2.5 % annually from 2003 to 2014 .
This was more than three times the growth rate during the preceding two terms of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso , who implemented “ Washington Consensus
” policies and remains a much - preferred statesman in the US capital .
Before Cardoso there was a decade - and - a - half of even worse economic failure , and income per person actually fell .
This return to growth , plus the government ’s use of increased revenues to boost social spending , has reduced Brazil ’s poverty rate by 55 % and extreme poverty by 65 % .
For those in extreme poverty , the government ’s internationally renowned conditional cash transfer programme –
Bolsa Familia – provided 60 % of their income in 2011 , up from 10 % in 2003 .
A hefty increase in the minimum wage – 84 % since 2003 after adjusting for inflation – also helped quite a bit .
Unemployment has fallen to a record low of 4.9 % ; it was 12.3 % when Lula da Silva took office in 2003 .
The quality of jobs has also increased : the percentage of workers stuck in the informal sector of the economy shrank from 22 % to 13 % .
Brazil ’s income distribution remains one of the more unequal in the world , but there was significant progress here too .
From 2003 to 2012 , the 40 % of the population just below the median nearly doubled their share of the country ’s income gains , as compared to the prior decade .
This came at the expense of the richest 10 % .
The poor have most obviously benefited from this transformation of the Brazilian economy , and this is reflected in the polls .
But it is not just the poor who improved their wellbeing : with a median household income of only about $ 800 , the vast majority of Brazilians were set to gain from the rising wages , shrinking unemployment and significantly increased pensions that the past decade had brought .
From the elites’ point of view , these gains that ordinary workers have made are not such good news .
A law requiring full - time domestic workers – of which there are a lot in Brazil , thanks to its crushing inequality – to be treated as formal employees , with maximum work hours , minimum wages and social security , was another recent annoyance for the “ haves
” .
A counter - narrative that the country under the PT is on the road to ruin has filled the media in Brazil , which is mostly against the government , and the international press .
In this view , the economy has slowed because the government is not sufficiently friendly to business .
Inflation , currently at the top of the target range at 6.5 % , is too high , fuelled by a labour market that is seen to be too tight , and the government , it is argued , needs to cut spending .
Another opposition theme in the last election , which has been recently resurrected , is that Brazil should be more friendly to the US and its highly unpopular foreign policy in the region .
The reality around Brazil ’s economic policy is that the government , since the end of 2010 , has listened to “ big finance ” a bit too much , raising interest rates and cutting spending when the economy was too weak .
Hopefully these mistakes will not be repeated .
If Rousseff wins , it will be because the majority of Brazilians got a lot of what they voted for .
They may want more , and they should –
but they are unlikely to opt for a return to the past ."
2014-10-03,"When Dilma Rousseff was inaugurated in January 2011 she became the first woman to hold the office of president in Brazil .
Following in the footsteps of her popular mentor , president Lula , expectations for Rousseff ’s presidency were very high .
Just a few weeks ago the president seemed in trouble , and a Marina Silva presidency a possibility , but the most recent polls show that Brazil ’s 135 m voters are likely to reelect Rousseff for a second term , although like in 2010 she will probably need a runoff vote .
Here you can find Mark Weisbrot commenting on why Dilma Rousseff could win Brazil ’s presidential election and Jonathan Watts on how the president has emerged as favourite to top Sunday ’s election .
While here is a look , in charts , at how Brazil has changed under Rousseff :"
2014-10-03,"A little over a year ago , Júlia da Luz Bueno was among the million or so protesters who waved placards and chanted for change in the biggest protests Brazil has seen in a generation .
This Sunday , however , she will go to the polling booth and vote for continuity : the re - election of Dilma Rousseff , the candidate for the ruling Workers’ party , as president .
The science student sees no contradiction .
Although many things could be better , Da Luz Bueno thinks the country is on the right track , particularly with regard to economic measures that aim to address one of the world ’s most unequal societies .
“
In general , things have greatly improved for everyone in Brazil , especially for the poor , ” she says .
“
I think Brazilians have confidence in the development of Brazil despite the large challenges we still face .
”
Her views are widely shared , according to opinion polls , which suggest the electorate will give a clear , but inconclusive victory to Rousseff in this weekend ’s elections for the presidency thanks largely to her income redistribution policies .
After a topsy - turvy year for the country and one of the most up - and - down political campaigns in recent memory , about 40 % of Brazilians look likely to vote for Workers’ party stability rather than experiment with the environmentally sustainable government promised by the president ’s main challenger , Marina Silva ( who is polling about 25 % ) , or return to the Social Democrat past represented by Aécio Neves ( third with 20 % ) .
If the surveys are accurate , that would set the stage on 26 October for a first - ever run - off between two women to decide who leads this traditionally macho nation and the world ’s seventh largest economy .
Both have extraordinary backgrounds .
Rousseff is a former Marxist activist who was imprisoned and tortured during the military dictatorship .
Silva is from a poor , mixed - race family of Amazonian rubber - tappers who campaigned alongside the late union activist and environmentalist Chico Mendes .
They served together as ministers in the first administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , though now offer divergent views about the country ’s future , particularly with regard to the economy .
This more than any other issue is crucial .
Although there have been many contentious issues – a huge corruption scandal at the country ’s biggest oil company Petrobras , the rising power of evangelical Christianity and widening social tensions over same - sex marriage and abortion , voters appear to be most influenced by the most traditional of factors : the money in their pockets .
Rousseff ’s strongest campaign message has been statistics showing steady progress in reducing inequality over the past 12 years of Workers’ party rule .
The rich - poor gap remains one of the highest in the world , but the Gini coefficient measure of inequality of 0.49 is down from 0.56 in 2001 .
The jobless rate is close to record lows at 5 % , the minimum wage is up more than 50 % in the past five years , tens of millions of people have risen out of poverty since the Workers’ party came to power in 2003 and the bolsa familia poverty relief payments have been extended to 13.8 million families .
The latter now cover almost a quarter of the population , making them a powerful political weapon .
Rousseff ’s support is unsurprisingly strongest among the lowest income groups and in the north - east , which has been Brazil ’s poorest region for much of the last century , but has enjoyed robust growth in the past decade .
Silva , by contrast , has tapped into middle - class frustrations with corruption and a sluggish economy that has crawled for the past two years and slipped into recession last month ( partly because there were so many public holidays during the World Cup ) .
She has promised to break with the left - right politics of the past by maintaining the social policies and poverty relief payments of the Workers’ party , while adopting pro - business economic measures usually associated with the centre - right Social Democrats .
She would give greater autonomy to the central bank and shift the focus of trade relations to the US , instead of regional blocks and other emerging Brics economies .
If she wins , she is widely expected to co - opt many members of the Neves camp into her team .
Prof Gaudêncio Torquato , professor of political communication at the University of São Paulo , says Silva appeals to the heart , while Rousseff appeals to the wallet – and for this reason the latter will win .
“
Marina is emotion .
Dilma is reason , ” he says .
“ Marina embodies the opposition to old - style politics .
Dilma represents the continuation of bolsa familia – wallet full , fridge full , tummy full , a grateful heart and head .
This is what determines how people vote : they choose the candidate who keeps their wallets full .
”
Carlos Pinkusfeld , a professor of economics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro concurs : “ Social indicators are good , poverty is down .
The Workers’ party has delivered at least reasonably good economic indicators .
I ’m sure that the government ’s economic performance will have a big impact .
”
But nothing can be taken for granted in a race that has been characterised by voter fickleness and so many unexpected twists and turns they could have been plotted by a scriptwriter .
Until June 2013 , Rousseff had looked a shoo - in with approval ratings of 73 % .
That number fell sharply after mass protests against corruption , police violence , forced relocations and wasteful public spending on football stadiums instead of transport , healthcare and education .
During the World Cup this year , Rousseff was heckled and booed , but was still clear favourite to win re - election .
Then in August , her prospects suddenly dimmed when Socialist party candidate Eduardo Campos died in a plane accident and was replaced by Silva , who tripled her coalition ’s share of the vote and briefly led the polls .
In past weeks , however , Rousseff has regained her lead .
All sides have engaged in fear - mongering , though the Workers’ party , with a powerful campaign machine , the advantages of incumbency and extra television time and campaign funds , has gone the furthest in its attacks .
Campaign ads have painted Silva as a candidate who would take food off the plates of the poor ( though Silva says she would continue bolsa familia because she knows better than most what it is like to go hungry ) , as a puppet of the banks ( though financial institutions have made record profits under the Rousseff administration ) and as a socially conservative evangelical in thrall to church leaders ( though Rousseff has also courted Pentecostal pastors and supported the appointment of homophobic religious leaders to key congressional committee chairs ) .
Workers’ party opponents , on the other hand , say a fourth consecutive presidential term ( after two by Lula and one by Rousseff ) would be bad for Brazil ’s democracy because it would strengthen its control over the courts and the media , as in Venezuela .
“ If the Workers’ party wins again , it will be 16 years in power .
That ’s a very long time .
It means we are progressively moving towards an undemocratic government , ” said Heni Ozi Cukier , an international relations professor at Fundação Getúlio Vargas University .
“
The Workers’ party is changing the national debate and changing everyone ’s perceptions and it ’s controlling the way people see reality .
It ’s terrible for a democracy .
If Dilma is re - elected , there will be an erosion of checks and balances and the division of power .
”
The Workers’ party also has a lot to lose .
Voters will be busy on Sunday , choosing not only a president , but 27 state governors , 513 congressmen , 1,069 regional lawmakers and a third of the senate .
Only when that is done and the second round completed on 26 October will it be clear how the political landscape has been shaped by last year ’s protests and this year ’s family budgets .

2014-10-05,"Brazil ’s president Dilma Rousseff was on course for victory in a first - round presidential election on Sunday night , but may well need a second round in three weeks’ time to secure a second term in office .
All indications in the runup to the poll were that Rousseff would secure more than 40 % of the vote .
The race for second place – and the right to challenge her in a runoff – was too close to call before the publication of official results .
As the nation ’s 143 million voters went to the polls , the front pages of almost every newspaper reported that the former environment minister Marina Silva , who was the frontrunner at one stage , had fallen into third place with 24 % behind the pro - business Social Democratic party candidate Aécio Neves , with 27 % .
While the gap between the two is within the margin of error , the surprisingly steep decline of Silva ’s vote in recent weeks underscores the volatility of public opinion during one of the most dramatic campaigns in recent memory .
Initial reports suggested voting was peaceful and orderly .
Television channels broadcast images of the candidates going to the ballot box with all of the three main contenders expressing confidence that they would be victorious .
Silva posted images of her in a campaign van on the way to a polling station in her home state of Acre , in the Amazon .
“
Bring on the second round .
Have the courage to change Brazil , ” she wrote .
Buoyed by a last - minute surge , the Neves team appeared to put more campaigners on the streets outside the polling stations .
Every car had at least Neves two pamphlets under their windscreen wipers and part - time staff handed out cards to every passerby willing to take one .
The Social Democratic candidate tweeted images of himself voting with his wife and a repeated call for votes to push him into a runoff .
“
This is how the dreams of Brazil can be realised , ” he wrote .
“
I have great faith and great respect , but I ’m ready to get to the second round and to govern Brazil ” .
The president ’s campaign team tried to mobilise voters through social network blitzes .
“ We have carried out a peaceful social revolution over the past 12 years to diminish longstanding social inequality in Brazil , ” tweeted Rousseff in a reference to the three consecutive terms of Workers’ party presidents .
“
We took the hunger map of Brazil made by the United Nations and we lifted billions of Brazilians to university .
To complete that , we are now preparing Brazil of a new cycle of even more profound change .
”
With more television time and campaign funds , Rousseff ’s centre - left Workers’ party and Neves’ centre - right Social Democratic party have focused their attacks on Silva , who has promised to break the decades - old stranglehold of the two main parties with a focus on sustainable development .
Early in the campaign , Silva benefited from outsider status and sympathy after the death of her running mate Eduardo Campos in a plane crash .
But , as the vote approached , the debate became less about emotions , change and personality and more about traditional left - right economic policies .
Dilma has solid backing from benefactors of the Bolsa Família poverty relief programme , which covers more than a fifth of voters , and Aécio is the first choice of business .
At the polling station in the Colégio Angelorum school in Gloria , Rio de Janeiro , several voters acknowledged that their opinions had shifted away from Silva in recent weeks .
“
I was going to vote for Marina , but she was terrible in the debates .
She looked very confused , ” said Aline Blajchman , a community care worker who said she was supporting the Green candidate Eduardo Jorge .
Of the dozen or so people approached by the Guardian , a majority said they would vote for Neves , who has benefited from a strong performance in the televised debates and the country ’s biggest campaign machine .
“
He is the most capable and knowledgeable of the three candidates – the safest pair of hands , ” said Silvana Cutrim , a shopkeeper .
“ Dilma is just an agitator and Marina is too unreliable .
”
Others expressed dissatisfaction with all three of the leading candidates , but – with voting obligatory under Brazilian law – said they would opt for continuity .
“
I will vote for Dilma .
She ’s bad , but the other candidates are worse , ” said Jaime Souza , a vegetable stall holder .
The election is one of the world ’s great exercises in democracy with 450,000 polling stations stretching from the Atlantic seaboard to deep inside the Amazon rainforest .
As well as choosing from the 11 presidential candidates , voters are selecting 27 state governors , 513 congressmen , 1,069 regional lawmakers and a third of the senate .
With voting carried out by machine , the results are expected within a few hours of the close of the polls .
The second round will take place on 26 October if the winning candidate does not secure 50 % of the vote ."
2014-10-06,"As expected Brazil ’s President , Dilma Rousseff , topped round one of the country ’s presidential election .
On 26 October , the president will face Aécio Neves of the centrist Brazilian Social Democracy party in a runoff .
Neves won 33.55 % of the vote , considerably more than pre - election polls were showing .
These had Neves on 24 - 27 % , while Rouseff ’s result ( 41.59 % ) was on the lower end of what the final pre - election polls were anticipating .
Rousseff was expected to face the runoff as favourite , but based on Sunday ’s result the vote is likely to be closer than expected just a couple of days ago .
Especially as a significant number of Socialist candidate Marina Silva ’s supporters are likely to back Neves .
Silva , who a month ago was leading in the polls , ended up on 21.32 % of the vote , pretty much the same as her 2010 run .
Rousseff ’s support was highest in the poorer states , the north east and north of the country where the Workers’ Party core base is strongest , but it will be where Silva ’s votes go in highly populated states like Rio de Janeiro , Pernambuco - Dilma won both in 2010 - and São Paulo that may end up being the decisive factor in three weeks time .
The map below shows how support for the incumbent president mapped out across the country ."
2014-10-12,"Dilma Rousseff ’s hopes of being re - elected as the Brazilian president suffered a blow on Sunday when her main rival was endorsed by the popular former environment minister Marina Silva .
Silva , who fell out of the race by coming third in the first round , threw her support behind pro - business candidate Aécio Neves of the Social Democratic party after securing his commitment to follow a policy of environmental sustainability .
Although it is far from certain that all of Silva ’s backers will follow her lead , the declaration puts more pressure on Rousseff , who is facing a tougher - than - expected fight in the runoff vote on 26 October .
The Workers party president won the first round with 41.5 % of the vote against Neves ’s 33.6 % , but a capricious electorate appears to be swinging towards the challenger , who is the favourite of the financial markets .
Even before Silva ’s announcement of support , the most recent Datafolha poll showed that Neves – who was a distant second just three weeks ago – was backed by 51 % of voters , compared with 49 % for Rousseff .
The gap is within the margin of error so the two are technically tied .
The incumbent has solid backing in the north - east and among lower - income groups , who have benefited from a rising minimum wage , high levels of employment and a widening poverty alleviation programme .
But middle - class voters in major urban centres in the south - east , such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , are concerned about the moribund economy and revelations of corruption surrounding the state - run oil company Petrobras .
Neves ’s party , which governed Brazil for decades , has also frequently been mired in corruption scandals , but it is campaigning on a promise of change after 12 years of Workers party government .
If elected , Neves says he will lower inflation , reform the tax system , intervene less in the market and slow the rise of the minimum wage .
Silva – who was once a member of the Workers party and served alongside Rousseff in the administration of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – has crossed the political spectrum .
She said her decision to back Neves came after he agreed to key elements of her programme , including sustainable development , more support for full - time education and the creation of a fund for reducing tensions between indigenous groups and farmers .
“
In view of the commitments made by Aécio Neves , I declare my vote and my support for his candidacy , ” she said ."
2014-10-24,"More than 130 million Brazilians will head to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president .
Incumbent Dilma Rousseff faces AÃ
© cio Neves of the centrist Brazilian Social Democracy party in a runoff vote .
In the first round Dilma won 41.4 % of the vote , with Neves taking 33.5 % .
The scale of the Neves result was particularly surprising , as it was noticeably higher than pre - election polls were showing .
Neves took his surge into the first few weeks of the II round campaign , but president Dilma has since edged ahead : Rousseff received a further boost in the closing days of the campaign , with unemployment dropping to 4.9 % .
Three weeks ago , Rousseffâ€ ™ s support was highest in the poorer states , the north east and north of the country where the Workersâ€ ™ Party core base is strongest , it will be where socialist candidate Marina Silvaâ€ ™ s first round votes go in highly populated states like Rio de Janeiro , Pernambuco - Dilma won both in 2010 - and SÃ£o Paulo that may end up being the decisive factor .
Marina Silva has endorsed Neves .
Nevertheless the president goes into Sundayâ€ ™ s vote as the favourite , but as the gap from Neves is still so close ( and Brazilian polls so volatile ) , the final debate between contenders may still provide surprises .
Before the final I round debate , Marina Silva was set for the runoff vote according to polls , and at one point she was even leading the race .
Then figures released on the Saturday - and indeed the result the following day - showed Neves overtaking Silva ."
2014-10-27,"President Dilma Rousseff has been re - elected president of Brazil , after securing more than 51 % of votes against rival Aécio Neves .
In her victory speech , Rousseff said she hoped the nation could rally together .
“
Instead of increasing differences and creating gaps , I strongly hope that we create the conditions to unite , ” she told supporters in Brasilia .
“
I want to be a much better president than I have been until now .
”
In Rio de Janeiro , more than a thousand Workers party supporters braved the rain to watch the results come in on a giant screen .
“
This is good for Brazil , ” said one campaigner , Vinicius Barchilon .
“ Dilma has done a lot for the poor and we have a government that is determined to tackle inequality .
”
Over the 12 years of Workers party rule , almost 40 million people – or a fifth of the population – have moved out of poverty .
The rich - poor gap remains one of the highest in the world , but the Gini coefficient measure of inequality of 0.49 is down from 0.56 in 2001 and unemployment is close to record lows .
What does Rousseff ’s re - election mean for you ?
Share your thoughts and experiences in the thread below or via GuardianWitness"
2014-10-30,"After an election campaign that was more unpredictable and nerve - racking than Brazil ’s popular soap operas , President Dilma Rousseff will lead the country for another four years .
Brazil ’s government has defined its foreign policy as “ active and prominent ” .
This is a legacy of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , who wanted to lead Brazil towards greater autonomy and relevance in the global order .
He wanted Brazil to contribute to a more democratic and multipolar world ; diversify its partnerships – with particular focus on countries in the global south and the Brics ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , South Africa ) ; and promote South American integration .
However , these initiatives were not without their tensions and contradictions .
Rousseff appeared to give less priority to foreign policy and some of the achievements of Lula ’s administration stagnated under her .
What should she focus on now
the election is out of the way ?
Regional integration The global economic crisis played a major role in slowing moves towards strengthening regional bodies such as the Union of South American Nations and the Common Market of the South .
Given its size and influence , Brazil should seize the opportunity to be both a political and economic engine to trigger a different and more collective answer to crisis and strengthen the region in the face of an increasingly globalised and volatile economy ( for example , Russia increased food imports from Brazil as a result of Europe ’s sanctions over its actions on Ukraine ) .
Moreover , its initiatives need to go beyond economic integration and promote people - centred integration .
Development financing
While Brazil should continue to pressure the US Congress to approve the changes negotiated over five years ago with the G20 on a larger voting quota at the IMF , it needs to move beyond traditional sources of finance available from the Bretton Woods institutions .
The Brics development bank , announced in July , is one obvious space in which to do this .
Brazil ’s record has been unimpressive in relation to similar initiatives such as the IBSA Fund and the Bank of the South .
If it truly aspires to alternative approaches to development , and hopes to challenge this northern - dominated sector , Rousseff ’s administration will need to make this a priority .
South - south cooperation
One area in which Brazil has been prominent politically is south - south cooperation , promoting collaboration on politics , economics , society , culture , the environment and technology .
However , there have been persistent challenges .
Brazil ’s budget for cooperation initiatives has decreased significantly since 2010 , while there have been concerning trends blurring the boundaries between cooperation , trade and investment .
The ProSavana project in Mozambique is a perfect example , where the Brazilian government has been accused of exporting domestic contradictions .
Brazil needs a strong agency to coordinate its efforts ; ways to ensure transparency ; and spaces for civil society to be involved .
Rousseff has to prove that south - south cooperation really is different from north - south cooperation , as both she and Lula have declared .
Democratising foreign policy Civil society has been calling for foreign policy to be more democratic by creating a participatory council linked to Brazil ’s foreign ministry .
This is in the context of a wider effort to incorporate social participation across government , and has even been agreed , in principle , by foreign minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo .
However , negotiations reached a standstill .
Brazil ’s foreign policy in the past 12 years has taken a new turn .
The country has gained a place at the global table .
It has played its cards as both a southern and a rising power .
It is Rousseff ’s responsibility to lead a public dialogue to define which identity better fits the wakening giant .

2014-12-10,"The Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , wept on Wednesday as she unveiled the findings of a Truth Commission investigation into the systematic murder , torture and other abuses carried out during the country ’s military dictatorship .
After a nearly three - year study , the commission confirmed that 191 people were killed and 243 “ disappeared ” under military rule , which lasted from 1964 to 1985 .
More than 200 have never been found .
The 2,000-page report named 377 officials who were blamed for serious human rights violations and recommended a revision to the 1979 Amnesty Law so that perpetrators can be prosecuted .
It also called on the military to recognise its responsibility for “ grave violations ” of the law and human rights , noting that even today the armed forces were uncooperative in providing materials and granting interviews about alleged abuses .
A share of the blame went to the United States and the UK , which were found to have trained Brazilian interrogators in torture techniques .
Among the victims of abuse was Rousseff , a former Marxist guerrilla who was beaten and jolted with electric shocks during her three - year detention at Tiradentes prison in the 1970s .
The president was visibly moved as she released the report of the seven - member commission , which she set up in 2012 .
“ Brazil deserves the truth , ” she said as tears welled up in her eyes .
“
The truth means above everything the opportunity to reconcile ourselves and our history .
”
As was the case elsewhere in Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s , the elite and middle class aligned themselves with the military to stave off what they saw as a communist threat .
Killings , torture and detention were commonly used against political enemies .
In Argentina and Chile , the toll of dead and missing were proportionally higher than in Brazil .
Many of the worst crimes in Brazil were already known , but the commission emphasised the political motives and organisation behind them , dismissing claims that the killings and other abuses were isolated acts of overzealous individuals .
“
Under the military dictatorship , repression and the elimination of political opposition was because of the policy of the state , conceived and implemented based on decisions by the president of the republic and military ministers , ” the commission concludes .
Several other countries have been implicated by commission members .
The Brazilians initially used French counter - insurgency techniques developed in Algeria , but in the 1960s US influence became stronger .
Many Brazilian officers went to Panama to train at the School of the Americas , alongside military and police officers from almost every other Latin American country , whether run by dictators or not .
Courses they were given included training in “ counter - insurgency techniques , command operations , intelligence and counterintelligence , psychological warfare operations , police - military operations and interrogation techniques , ” the report says .
Secret instruction manuals used at the school were declassified by the US department of defence in the mid-1990s , revealing training in torture and other serious violations of human rights .
In the 1970s , Brazilian officers were sent to London for training in torture techniques .
A former president , General Ernesto Geisel , who ruled from 1974 - 79 , is quoted as saying , “
The English , in their secret service , acted with discretion .
Our people , inexperienced and extroverted , did it openly .
I do n’t justify torture , but I recognise there are circumstances when the individual is impelled to practise torture , to obtain certain confessions and so avoid a greater evil .
”
The report also quotes former general Hugo de Andrade Abreu , who said “ at the end of 1970 we sent a group of army officers to England to learn the English system of interrogation .
This consists of putting the prisoner in a cell incommunicado , a method known as the ‘ refrigerator’ .
”
In 1971 , the “ English system
” , as it became known , was put into practice in Rio army HQ in Barão de Mesquita street , which had become a torture centre .
Four new cubicles were built .
One , lined with polystyrene and asbestos , was a “ cold room
” , another a “ sound room
” .
A third was all white and the fourth all black .
Each cubicle was monitored to enable interrogators to listen to the prisoners’ heartbeats .
“
They were variations on the techniques used by the British army against Irish terrorists , ” said Amílcar Lobo , an army psychiatrist who worked in a torture centre at Petrópolis known as the ‘ house of death’ .
“
They were destined to destructure the personality of the prisoners without touching them .
”
To uncover the truth about such abuses , the commission questioned victims and former officers , combed archives and re - examined medical records .
Many activists , however , said the truth was not enough .
After the report was unveiled , a group of 10 protesters waved banners and shouted demands for punishment of those responsible for executions and torture .
Members of the commission also called for punishment .
They said abuses continue today because the dictatorship era set an example of impunity .
“ Amnesty does not extend to the agents of the state who put in practice excesses of violence , ” said the former minister of justice José Carlos Dias , one of the six out of seven commission members to call for a lifting of the amnesty .
But there are many obstacles to doing so .
Supreme court justices have previously rejected requests to lift the amnesty and described the issue as a “ page that has been turned ” .
Rousseff has also previously indicated her reluctance to settle old political scores , saying national unity was a higher priority .
The report notes that even though the widespread torture and executions were not covered in the Brazilian media due to censorship , “ surprising ” details of how they worked were revealed in a recently declassified telegram by the US consul general , Clarence A Boonstra , in Rio de Janeiro in 1973 .
The commission notes that Boonstra told his superiors about a crackdown in which there was an increase in arrests , mostly of college students .
Their interrogations , he noted , were carried out under “ a system of intensive psychophysical abuse , developed to extract information without leaving visible and lasting marks on the body ” .
The detainees suspected of being “ hardline terrorists ” continued , according to the report , “ to be submitted to old methods of physical violence that sometimes cause death ” .
One of the few former military officers who agreed to talk to the Truth Commission was ex - colonel Paulo Malhães , who was among those sent to the UK for training .
Malhães told the commission “ psychological torture was best , and England was the best place to learn it
” .
“
It did n’t leave physical marks , and it was much more efficient than brute force , especially when you were trying to transform militants into infiltrated agents .
”
Malhães , by his own admission was also a sadistic physical torturer , who used snakes , crocodiles and rats to terrify prisoners .
Two weeks after giving evidence to the Truth Commission in Rio , he was found dead at his home in mysterious circumstances .
Former political prisoners believe he was eliminated to stop him talking more to the Truth Commission and providing the names of torturers .
Some of the information in the report came from diplomatic correspondence in the UK National Archives at Kew , but the commission notes that a request for access to still - classified British documents , sent to the British government , has not yet been answered ."
2014-12-24,"Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has stirred up the wrath of environmentalists by appointing a controversial advocate of agribusiness and weaker forest conservation as her new agriculture minister .
Kátia Abreu , who has been nicknamed the “ chainsaw queen ” by her enemies , is included in a new cabinet that rewards political allies who supported Rousseff in her recent narrow re - election victory .
Abreu is a leading figure in the “ ruralista ” lobby , which prompted the government to weaken Brazil ’s forest code .
In congressional debates and in her feisty newspaper column , she has called for more roads through the Amazon , congressional control over demarcation of indigenous reserves , more efficient monocultures , and the approval of genetically modified “ terminator seeds ” .
The cabinet post is a step towards bigger ambitions for Abreu , a formidable political operator .
In an interview with The Guardian this year , Abreu said she wanted to make Brazil the leading agricultural producer in the world .
She also expressed her desire to emulate former UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher , and said she was preparing to run for president one day .
Abreu says she is an advocate of sustainable development and insists that Brazilian agriculture can overtake the US without any further deforestation .
But her promotion has horrified many environmental campaigners .
In a statement headed “ Miss Deforestation is the new agricultural minister , ” Greenpeace warned that the Rousseff administration was now set on an alarming course .
“
By choosing Katiá Abreu , the president has confirmed that the path the government will take in the coming years will put agribusiness above the environment
” , it said , claiming the senator had was a leading figure in forest destruction and suppression of the rights of rural workers and indigenous people .
Reinforcing such concerns , the new science and technology minister will be Aldo Rebelo – a man with a reputation as a climate change sceptic .
In a tweet posted several years ago , Rebelo used a cold spell in São Paulo to mock claims of global warming and support the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam .
“
Hello , Sao Paulo , cold in here , huh ?
Where are the advocates of global warming now ?
In the shops , buying the last heater ...
Electric !
Long live Belo Monte !
” , he said .
Rebelo is reshuffled from a post as sports minister , where he was widely criticised for the delays and poor public relations that marred preparations for this year ’s World Cup ."
2015-02-04,"Brazil ’s biggest ever corruption scandal claimed its most prominent victim on Wednesday when the chief executive of state oil giant , Petrobras resigned along with five senior directors .
Maria das Graças Foster , who was hand - picked by President Dilma Rousseff to run the country ’s most powerful company , was forced to step down after a widening investigation discovered 23bn reais ( $ 8.9bn ) of suspect payments , bribes and kickbacks to politicians .
The fall of such a key ally adds to the growing pressure on Rousseff , who is already struggling with a moribund economy , the worst drought in living memory and allegations that her party and allies were effectively using Petrobras as an ATM for their campaigns .
Foster – an engineer who rose through the ranks to be the company ’s first female CEO – is not accused of wrongdoing , but she is accused of ignoring tip - offs about the money being creamed off of contracts for executives and politicians .
In recent months , she has faced repeated calls for her resignation as the scale of the corruption scandal has become apparent and the Petrobras share price has plunged 70 % since its September peak .
Rousseff – who regularly invited Foster to the presidential palace – is reported to have decided last week that she could no longer protect her friend after the company had to delay the release of audited financial results because of uncertainty about the amount of write - offs for graft - related costs .
The company ’s external auditor PwC has refused to sign the accounts because of the lack of clarity .
Analysts said the resignation was overdue .
“
Everyone knows the only reason she did n’t leave earlier was because of the stubbornness of Dilma and because last year was an election year , ” said Adriano Pires from the Brazilian Infrastructure Centre .
He said the government , which has long meddled in the management of Petrobras , now needed to let the company make a fresh start .
If the government lets the new board have more autonomy , Petrobras has everything it needs to recover …
But if the government does not acknowledge that everything has to change , then there really is no way out for Petrobras .
”
Petrobras confirmed Foster ’s departure in a terse one - line statement on Wednesday announcing a meeting of the board of directors on Friday “ due to the resignation of the president [ chief executive ] and the five directors ” .
They will have their work cut out trying to restore the reputation of a company that , until last year , Brazilians considered one of two national treasures along with the Seleção national football team .
But its business and image have been hit by falling oil prices , which has made it almost uneconomical to drill for their deepwater reserves , arrests , and a barrage of lawsuits from US investors over the scandal .
The corruption investigation , which police have named Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) , has revealed massive illicit payments from contractors to Petrobras directors .
Many millions of dollars were channeled to the ruling Workers Party and its allies in congress .
Two former executives were arrested last year including the former head of refining , Paulo Roberto Costa , who has since turned state witness .
With the scandal still widening , further high - profile arrests are expected in the political world and construction industry .
Rousseff , who was Petrobras chairman while much of the wrongdoing was taking place , is also under scrutiny .
She has denied knowledge of the kickback scheme .
The president is likely to miss the support of Foster , who has reportedly been a personal friend since the two worked together at the ministry of mines and energy in 2003 .
After appointing Foster as head of Petrobras in 2012 , Rousseff met with her frequently at the presidential palace in Brasilia .
Foster told reporters in December she offered to resign three times after the auditors first refused to sign off on the company ’s accounts , but she agreed to stay in the job as long as the president trusted her .
Independent investigators hired by the company took her laptop and phone for examination before Christmas .
“
This is good for the company , ” Foster said at the time .
“
We are n’t afraid of the truth . ”"
2015-03-15,"More than half a million Brazilians took to the streets on Sunday to protest against corruption , demand the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and , in some cases , to call for a military coup .
The rightwing demonstration comes amid growing frustration at the moribund economy , political constipation and a huge bribery scandal at the state - run oil company , Petrobras .
Singing the national anthem , waving flags and chanting “ Fora Dilma
”
( “ Dilma out ” ) , between 10 and 20 thousand predominantly white , middle class people marched along the seafront at Copacabana to insist on a change of government barely five months after Rousseff was re - elected .
Police estimated the crowd in Rio de Janeiro at 25,000 .
In the centre of São Paulo , ten times that number joined a rally on Avenida Paulista , according to the Datafolha polling agency .
In the capital , Brasilia , 40,000 rallied in front of Congress .
In both Belo Horizonte and Belem , about 20,000 people joined the anti - government demonstrations .
Another 40,000 were reported on the streets in Ribeirão Preto in São Paulo state and 100,000 in Porto Alegre .
Altogether demonstrations took place in more than 60 cities , also including Recife , Salvador , Manaus and Fortaleza with the overall turnout likely to exceed 500,000 .
Local media and police reported a total of more than a million people , though their figures were based on a four - times higher estimates of the crowd in São Paulo .
In Rio , many wore the canary yellow jerseys of the national football team or bore banners declaring outrage at a range of perceived national ills and policies that they say have more in common with less stable and more radical leftwing government in Latin America .
“ Brazil does not want and will not be a new Venezuela , ” read one .
“ Nation + Liberty = PT ( Workers Party )
Out !
” declared another .
There was a range of voices .
While one flag extolled “ Peace and Love ” , a sizeable contingent of the crowd expressed support for a return to the military dictatorship that ran the country between 1964 and 1985 “ Army , Navy and Air Force .
Please save us once again of [ sic ] communism ” read one banner in English .
Among those holding it was computer graphic designer Marlon Aymes who said military force was the only way to unseat the Workers Party .
“
They are in power for 16 years .
That is like a dictatorship , ” he said .
“
In 1964 the military of Brazil took a stand against a president who was close to the Kremlin .
Today , the PT is in a group that wants a Bolivarian socialist model across Latin America .
Common people are protesting and calling for impeachment , but congress is too corrupt to approve that
so we need military intervention .
”
More moderate views were expressed by another demonstrator , Henrique Figueirdeo , a 23-year - old student of administration .
“
I do n’t want a return to dictatorship .
We need progressive politics and we need democracy .
But we also need to tackle corruption and improve efficiency .
For that we need a change of government .
”
Rousseff said she supported the protesters’ rights to march and expressed hope that the rallies , which mark the 30th anniversary of the end of military rule , would demonstrate Brazil ’s “ democratic maturity ” .
Opposition leader Aécio Neves , who lost by a narrow margin in October , said the protesters “ went to the streets to reunite with their virtues , their values and also with their dreams
” .
Many expressed support for a more radical rightwing politician , Jair Bolsonaro , who is a military reservist and has defended the dictatorship era .
Although he has upset many with homophobic and sexist comments he won more votes in Rio than any other congressman last year .
“
We need another president , maybe Bolsonaro .
He is close to the armed forces and he is the only one who speaks out , ” said Anna Mario Aracejo , an art teacher who was carrying a sign urging the use of armed force to “ liberate Brazil from corrupt politicians , parties and traitors of the nation .
”
Bolsonaro ’s son Flávio , also a politician , was embraced by many in the crowd .
“
This is a country without options , with high taxes and poor government , ” he told the Guardian .
“
We do n’t want a coup , but the government must respect the constitution .
”
Some called for more internet freedom and lower taxes .
Others complained at the weak economy , which is forecast to sink into recession this year , and the decade - high inflation of 7.7 % .
Many said they were marching because of the Petrobras scandal , which has seen 57 politicians , including former president Fernando Collor de Mello , investigated for kick - backs worth at least $ 3bn ( £ 2.03bn ) .
Rousseff is not under investigation but as a former chair of Petrobras during the period when much of the corruption took place , she has struggled to avoid being tainted by a scandal that has implicated allies and opponents alike .
Although all the major parties have been dragged into the mire , most of those implicated are from the ruling coalition and the demonstrators were collecting signatures calling for the impeachment of Rousseff .
“
It ’s unbelievable .
They are n’t politicians .
They are criminals , ” said India Longras , who beat a frying pan painted with “ Fora Dilma
” .
“
I was born in the military dictatorship .
It was a lot better than now .
If I had to choose between then and now , I ’d choose dictatorship .
Education was better , crime was low and the poor lived with dignity .
”
Calls for a military coup were less evident at the bigger rallies in São Paulo and Brasilia .
Sunday ’s protests were the biggest in Brazil since 2013 , but the profile and politics of the participants were very different and they passed more peacefully .
The Confederations Cup demonstrations two years ago had their origins in a campaign to secure free public transport and spread rapidly particularly among the young , via social networks after police violence inflamed public opinion .
The latest wave of protests , however , is from an older , whiter , more affluent demographic , following widespread advance coverage by the mainstream media .
Anticipating this , the Workers Party organised a rally last Friday in support of the government and state control of Petrobras , but there were less than a thousand people at their main demonstration in central Rio . •
The headline on this article , and a picture caption , were amended on 16 March 2015 to correct misspellings of Rousseff ’s name ."
2015-03-17,"The bad news just keeps coming for Brazil ’s President Dilma Rousseff .
On Monday , the treasurer of the ruling Workers’ Party was formally charged with corruption .
The day before , enormous anti - government demonstrations filled the streets of more than 160 cities .
The economy is faltering , inflation is rising and poverty reduction is at risk of stalling .
Her cabinet are in crisis mode , but they are hamstrung by a fractious legislature and a debilitating scandal at the state - run oil firm Petrobras , which has led to investigations of 34 sitting politicians , including the speakers of both houses of Congress .
Just five months into her second term , this is posing difficult questions not just for the president , but for her party – and for Brazil ’s 30-year - old democracy .
The latest blow was the formal indictment of João Vaccari , the Workers’ Party treasurer , who is accused of soliciting hundred of millions of donations from Petrobras executives .
Prosecutors said they had ample proof that Vaccari knew the money was raised from bribes and kickbacks .
Twenty - six others were charged .
More will follow , many of them from the ruling coalition .
Rousseff , who was chairwoman of the Petrobras board when much of the wrongdoing took place , is also under pressure .
Although she is not under investigation and has denied knowledge of the corruption , members of the public are not convinced .
The Petrobras scandal was high among a long list of grievances that brought people to the streets on Sunday .
Estimates of the number of protesters range from hundreds of thousands to more than 1.5 million – huge by any standard .
Countless others also came to their balconies and windows to clang their pots and pans in disapproval at government policies .
The domestic media reported demonstrations in more than 160 cities .
Workers’ Party struggles It was a shock for the Workers’ Party , which rose to power through mass mobilisations , but now appears to have lost the streets .
Pro -
government rallies called by trade unions two days earlier attracted only a tiny fraction of this interest .
In São Paulo , the turnout was around 10,000 .
In central Rio , it was probably less than 1,000 .
This was a sad echo of the early years of this century , when the first Workers’ Party president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , drew vast crowds to his campaigns , including students , social activists , union members and anyone hopeful of change .
In the past four years under Rousseff , however , the party has increasingly struggled to mobilise even the rank - and - file .
The radical left has grown disillusioned by the compromises and failed promises of more than a decade in power , a burgeoning corruption scandal at Petrobras has paralysed the petrochemical and construction industries , choking job creation , and many former supporters who benefited from interventionist social programmes have started to fear they will slip back toward poverty as a result of the worsening economy .
Adding a regional context to these woes , there are signs that poverty reduction is flatlining both in Brazil and Latin America as a whole .
In response to the demonstration of public frustration , Rousseff and her aides are hastily drawing up a package of new measures to address public concerns about bribery , impunity and an economy in the doldrums .
But many on the left warn that unmet expectations are the real danger for Rousseff .
“
The biggest risk for the PT ( Workers’ Party ) may not be the throngs that occupied the streets , but the crowd that stayed at home , ” wrote columnist Eliane Brum , referring to former supporters who no longer feel motivated to march .
Despite Rousseff ’s electoral mandate , it will be hard to govern without popular support .
“
What we have today is an organized and popular right , which can bring thousands of people to the streets , and a fragmented and bankrupt left .
This has never happened in the history of Brazil , ” said Vladimir Safatle , a philosophy professor at the University of São Paulo .
“
This is a government that will try to survive , not rule …
What we will see now is a complete paralysis , not just of the government , but of the historical development of the New Republic .
”
A president ‘ virtually under siege’ Rousseff , who has the lowest approval rating of any president in 15 years , has asked for patience in dealing with what she describes as “ temporary problems ” , but the calls for her resignation or impeachment are growing stronger .
There is currently no legal basis for this .
Although her close aides have been implicated in the Petrobras scandal , prosecutors said last week that the president is not under investigation .
But she may be politically vulnerable because impeachment decisions are made in Congress , where last year ’s election weakened the Workers’ Party and left her with a more splintered coalition .
Many on the right sense an opportunity .
“
The president has become even more trapped .
She is virtually under siege , without congressional approval .
To see such a situation in only the third month of new mandate means we will have a lame - duck president for a long period , ” said Rodrigo Constantino , the president of the Liberal Institute .
“
The possibility of impeachment has also increased .
It is still unlikely , but if the probability was around 10 % before , then today it should be closer to 30 % and rising .
”
The ruling party warn darkly that the opposition is plotting a coup against the president , who won with a narrow but undisputed victory in October .
Some among the crowds in Rio on Sunday carried banners calling for military intervention , but such views were on the fringe of bigger rallies in São Paulo and elsewhere .
The protests passed peacefully and were described by the justice ministry as “ an expression of democracy ” .
It has been 30 years since the end of the military dictatorship .
Although the flaws in the current system of government , particularly Congress , are increasingly apparent , most institutions remain considerably stronger and less politicised than in Venezuela or Argentina .
The danger now is that stagnation and increasingly polarised public opinion could push either the government to crack down on its critics , or opponents to disregard the president ’s electoral mandate .
So far that has not been the case .
Rousseff and her ministers will hope to placate some of the popular fury with fresh anti - corruption measures , but they are unlikely to prove any more effective than a sticking plaster on a gaping wound .
The political paralysis looks set to worsen as the economy continues to flounder .
The remaining three and a half years of the president ’s mandate will test not only the patience of an increasingly unhappy electorate but also the robustness of a young democracy ."
2015-03-22,"The young Brazilian protester on the Copacabana seafront had to shout to make himself heard above the sound of trucks blasting out criticism of President Dilma Rousseff and her Workers party .
“
We have to get rid of them .
They are communists who are trying to link up with Venezuela , Argentina and Cuba so they can turn Latin America into one big Bolivarian socialist republic , ” yelled Eduardo Mendes , a computer science student .
“
It has gone too far .
Today we ’re bringing two million people on to the street to show in a peaceful demonstration that Brazil will never allow that .
”
His words were defiant and contentious , but there was no doubting the sincerity of the feeling behind them .
After more than 12 years of leftwing rule , Mendes was desperate for a turn in the political tide .
Until a few years ago , that might have been dismissed as wishful rightwing thinking .
Back then , Rousseff was riding high in the polls .
The economy appeared to have escaped the worst of the global financial crisis .
Social welfare programmes , such as the bolsa familia cash handouts , had sharply reduced extreme poverty .
Brazil was pre - eminent in a Latin America so dominated by leftwing governments – Hugo Chávez in Venezuela , Evo Morales in Bolivia , Rafael Correa in Ecuador , José Mujica in Uruguay , Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Raúl Castro in Cuba , among others – that people talked of a “ pink tide
” .
But tides ebb as well as flow , as Rousseff and several Latin American leaders are being forced to realise , amid growing public hostility , an increasingly unfavourable global economy and a series of spectacular scandals that have highlighted the ethically corrosive effects of more than a decade in power .
Mendes was far from alone in his outrage .
The protests last week were among the biggest ever witnessed in Brazil .
Estimates of the combined total of protesters at rallies in more than 150 cities range from hundreds of thousands to more than 1.5 million .
Even among those who stayed at home , Rousseff is immensely unpopular .
Her “ good or great ” approval rating fell last week to 13 % – the lowest of any president since Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached in 1992 .
She has been hit by the twin blows of a stagnating economy , which is expected to slip back into recession this year , and a jaw - dropping corruption scandal at the state - run oil company , Petrobras .
More than 100 executives and politicians of all ideological stripes have been implicated in at least $ 3bn of kickbacks , bribery and money - laundering dating back to the 1990s and ramping up enormously after the Workers party won power .
Prosecutors have cleared the president of responsibility , but few Brazilians believe she was unaware of what was happening because she was president of Petrobras during the period when the corruption was at its height .
In the latest blow , her party ’s treasurer , João Vaccari , was formally charged last week with soliciting donations from political slush funds illegally built up by Petrobras officials .
Corruption in Latin America long predates the emergence of leftist governments in the early 21st century .
But the venality and cynicism of Workers party officials caught up in the Petrobras scandal stand in contrast to the idealistic values of the São Paulo Forum , which since 1990 has brought together a wide range of left - leaning groups in the region , including Nicaraguan Sandinistas , Cuban communists , the Brazilian Workers party , the Socialist party of Chile , Chavismo supporters in Venezuela and the ideologically mercurial Peronists of Argentina .
If the “ Latin left ” exists – which is questionable , given the very different circumstances of each nation – then this is the organisation that binds them together with the shared objectives of fighting inequality and neoliberal economics , strengthening regional integration and working towards a world in which diplomacy and trade is rebalanced away from the US and towards China , Russia , Iran and emerging economies such as Turkey and Indonesia .
Several prominent members are now on the ropes .
In Argentina , President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has seen her approval ratings fall below 30 % as the economy has slipped close to recession .
Hundreds of thousands of protesters have rallied in Buenos Aires over the suspicious death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman , who was found with a bullet in his head just hours before he was to testify before congress that the president had allegedly conspired with Iran to cover up the deadly bombing of a Jewish community centre in 1996 .
She is also something of a lame duck , with her second term due to expire at the end of the year , when she will be barred by the constitution from standing again .
In Venezuela , just 22 % approve of the job done by President Nicolás Maduro – the lowest rating since he replaced Chávez two years ago .
Like Rousseff in Brazil after Lula , he lacks his predecessor ’s charisma and faces harsher economic challenges , including nosediving oil prices , sky - high inflation , a rampant black market and worsening shortages of basic goods .
Violent street protests left more than 40 dead last year .
This year , at least one student has been killed in continuing unrest .
There are common threads behind these recent declines , according to Armando Castelar , former head economist at the Brazilian Development Bank .
“
For the past decades we have enjoyed extremely favourable conditions , thanks to the China - driven commodities boom and the abundance of international liquidity , but now we are seeing a major change .
This is happening for the first time since the leftwing governments came to power .
Until now they have enjoyed exceptionally good international conditions .
Now they have to deal with setbacks .
”
This has left less money for social programmes that were already starting to feel the pinch of diminishing returns after big initial success .
Poverty reduction has almost stalled in Brazil and Argentina since 2013 and has slipped into reverse in Venezuela .
This contrasts painfully with the greater recent success of centre - left or centre - right governments – like Chile , Peru and Colombia – in dealing with poverty .
But the issue is not black and white .
Bolivia , which follows a radical political path under Morales , has one of the region ’s best performing economies .
Beatriz Bissio , a political scientist from Uruguay , said it was too early to say the left was on the way out .
“
If we are to look only at the demonstrations in several countries , or what is happening in Venezuela , then we will see a certain retreat , but I would not yet conclude the left is going backwards and the right moving forwards .
We are in a complex situation , ” she said .
“
We are entering a difficult time , but in the medium term perspective I am not pessimistic .
The process of progressive change will continue .
Latin America has gained political maturity .
”
This situation has been aggravated by disputes with the US , international capital markets and major media conglomerates .
Argentina can not access international credit because “ vulture funds ” refuse to accept a debt repayment plan .
Venezuela is facing sanctions by the US .
Big international investors such as George Soros have reduced their holdings in Brazil ’s companies and driven down the currency to its lowest level in 10 years .
Many see a conspiracy at work .
“
The Latin American left is coming up against an enemy that it has never prepared itself for , ” said Federico Neiburg , an economic anthropologist at the Museu Nacional .
“
It ’s an alliance between shifting geopolitical interests , economic and financial elites trying to impose politics that are beneficial to them , and political action on behalf of the media .
The media is one of the most important players in this game .
If we follow what they say , then the days of the progressive governments of Latin America are coming to an end .
But that is not a diagnosis of the situation , it ’s a bet .
”
The odds , however , are shortening with each drop in GDP growth and presidential approval ratings .
Castelar said the election in Argentina in October is likely to be the first big test of whether there has been a shift in the public mood .
“
But regardless of whether the left loses in the short term , they will have solidified their reputation for championing social issues and individual rights , and that will serve them well in the long run .
”
The “ pink tide
” may be looking a lot murkier than 10 years ago , but it is not over yet .

2015-04-17,"Among Brazil ’s weak and demoralised leftwing members of Congress , they are known as the “ Bancada BBB ” : Bullets , Beef and Bible Caucus .
These conservative hardliners – from Brazil ’s security forces , agricultural sector and evangelical churches – triumphed in last October ’s legislative elections , while President Dilma Rousseff , of the leftwing Workers’ Party ( PT ) , only narrowly won re - election .
Over the past few months , the president ’s authority has been undermined by a massive corruption scandal , major street protests and the open revolt of many of her former political allies .
With a survey this week showing that 63 % of Brazilians would support impeachment proceedings against her , an energised coalition of rightwing deputies are attempting to impose their agenda on Congress .
Their long - term aims include liberalising Brazil ’s gun laws and opening up its indigenous territories to industry .
But their first goal is to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 18 to 16 .
Under Brazil ’s Child and Adolescent Statute ( ECA ) , the maximum legal punishment for someone ages
12 - 18 is three years’ internment in a juvenile socio - educative detention centre .
In theory , such a sentence is only applicable in cases involving violence , though judges often interpret the law to include drug - trafficking .
One of the prime movers behind the attempt to change the age of criminal responsibility is Jair Bolsonaro , 60 , a six - time federal deputy , who won more votes than any other congressman in Rio de Janeiro in the 2014 elections .
Speaking to the Guardian at his house inside an immaculate gated community in Rio ’s upmarket suburb of Barra da Tijuca , Bolsonaro said : “ An adolescent can rape and kill 200 people and he is still not treated like a criminal in Brazil .
Most minors know that if they are going to commit a robbery , it is better to kill the victim as there is less chance of being caught , and if they are , the punishment will be the same .
”
According to Unicef , however , Brazilian adolescents are far more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators : of the 21 million aged 12 - 17 , just 0.013 % committed murder , robbery with murder , rape or bodily harm , while homicide was the cause of 36.5 % of all adolescents’ deaths by non - natural causes .
Thirty - three thousand Brazilian adolescents were murdered in Brazil from 2006 to 2012 .
Bolsonaro ’s response to such statistics is to argue that PT ’s social assistance programmes have encouraged “ irresponsible paternity ” .
This has created a generation of Brazilians “ who , sadly , have no future whatsoever ” and who are prone to violence because of the lack of a rigorous criminal justice system .
The former army captain , who hopes to run for the presidency in 2018 , is the indisputable poster child of the insurgent Brazilian right , and repeatedly courts controversy with gratuitously offensive speeches .
On Tuesday he was ordered by a federal judge to pay R$150,000 ( £ 33,000 ) in damages for homophobic comments he made on Brazilian TV in 2011 .
In an interview with Playboy that same year he said he would “ rather his child died in an accident than be gay ” .
He is also being sued by Maria do Rosário , a former human rights’ minister from the PT , after he described her , in Congress , as “ not worth raping ” .
Over 10 years earlier he had told her the same thing , at the end of a televised discussion on the age of criminal responsibility .
While claiming he exaggerated “ a little ” over his comments to Playboy , he was unrepentant over the comments to Do Rosário .
“
Who is tougher on rape ?
I have presented two projects to Congress on the issue : first , to strengthen the sentencing for rape ; second , to offer chemical castration to offenders .
But the PT has blocked them both .
”
With over 550,000 inmates , Brazil has the world ’s fourth - largest prison population .
More than 40 % of those incarcerated are still awaiting trial .
But Bolsonaro believes prison is the best way to reduce the country ’s extremely high level of violent crime .
“
I prefer a prison full of criminals than a graveyard full of innocent people , ” he said .
On 31 March , the bill to lower the age of criminal responsibility passed its first legislative hurdle .
A Datafolha opinion poll published on Wednesday showed that 87 % of Brazilians are in favour of the bill .
With such popular and congressional support , Bolsonaro is confident that finally , after almost two decades of trying , he will succeed .
“
As soon as the law is passed , I will put forward another constitutional amendment , to lower the age to 14 , ” he said .
However , even if Congress approves the bill , it would still require ratification by the senate .
It may also face obstacles in the supreme court .
Earlier this week President Rousseff used her Facebook feed to condemn the proposal .
“
Lowering the age of criminal responsibility will not solve the problem of juvenile delinquency , ” she wrote , though she added that she had instructed her justice minister to begin a debate over the ECA .
Even those opposed to a lowering of the age of criminal responsibility question whether the three - year maximum sentence is sufficient .
Julita Lemgruber , a former director of Rio de Janeiro ’s prison system , said there was a debate to be had over extending the period of custody for adolescents convicted of serious crimes .
But she added the real issue was the state ’s failure to implement existing legislation .
“
The law is very clear on the services that should be provided to adolescents when they are deprived of their liberty .
But they never get them .
On the contrary , instead they are put into these filthy and overcrowded places with nothing to do .
”
But Lemgruber is worried that Bolsonaro will get his way .
“
The reality is that the federal government is very vulnerable at the moment .
Everything is negotiable , ” she said ."
2015-06-30,"Barack Obama and Dilma Rousseff put climate change at the top of their agenda at their bilateral meeting on Tuesday , with the US and Brazil agreeing to obtain up to 20 % of their electricity from renewable power by 2030 .
Brazil also committed to restoring up to 12 m hectares of forest – an area about the size of England or Pennsylvania – in another attempt to reduce the carbon pollution that causes climate change .
The White House said the initiatives were part of a new US - Brazil climate partnership , loosely modelled on the historic US - China agreement reached during Obama ’s visit to Beijing last November , intended to build momentum for a global deal to fight climate change in Paris at the end of the year .
“
Following progress during my trips to China and India , this shows that the world ’s major economies can begin to transcend some of the old divides and work together to confront the common challenge that we face , ” said Obama at a joint press conference with his Brazilian counterpart .
Rousseff also heralded the agreement as a highlight of her trip , claiming it would help progress towards a global emissions reductions agreement at upcoming talks in Paris .
“ Climate change is one of the central challenges of the 21st century , ” she said .
“
And we have one important objective , which is , number one , to ensure that the energy mix in our two countries will have a substantial share of renewable sources of energy .
“
As countries that are as vast as continents , we have this very important greenhouse gas emissions target , ” added Rousseff .
“
We attach a great deal of importance to reducing [ deforestation ] .. and we also wish to turn the page and engage in a clear - cut reforestation - oriented policy .
”
The pledge will require the US to triple its production of wind and solar power and other renewable energies .
Brazil will need to double its production of clean energy .
The figures do not include hydro power .
“
This is a big deal , ”
Brian Deese , the White House climate adviser , told a call with reporters .
He said putting climate change at the centre of the US - Brazil relationship would help drive action on the issue .
“
We are shining a spotlight on the issues and elevating the conversation around them , ” he said .
Rich and poor countries alike have been putting forth their commitments , known as nationally determined contributions , to reduce emissions as part of the treaty , which world leaders hope to finalise later this year in Paris .
Brazil also plans to expand renewable energy sources other than hydropower to between 28 % and 33 % of its total energy mix by 2030 .
And in the electricity sector , the US and Brazil jointly announced intentions to increase their share of renewable , non - hydropower sources to 20 % by 2030 .
Deese said boosting renewables that high in the US would be dependent on controversial power plant emission limits that the Obama administration has proposed .
“
We believe that this is an ambitious target , but one that is actually achievable and will create new low - cost opportunities for the American economy , ” Deese said .
“
To achieve it , we ’re going to have to continue to hit our marks in implementing the regulations we ’ve identified to date .
”
The US has already announced its full commitment to the climate treaty : a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of up to 28 % by 2025 , compared with 2005 levels .
But a key sticking point in the climate treaty has been whether developing countries like Brazil will be willing to make substantial contributions .
Poorer nations have balked , arguing that industrialised nations that have polluted more historically bear more of the responsibility for curbing climate change .
The announcement comes on the second day of Rousseff ’s visit to Washington , where she met with Obama in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning .
In their visit , Obama and Rousseff have been working to show they have moved beyond tensions sparked by the revelation nearly two years ago that the US was spying on Rousseff .
She cancelled a planned state visit in response .
Officials in both countries say neither leader is interested in rehashing the spying issues this week and instead want to focus on ways to deepen cooperation .
The Associated Press contributed to this report"
2015-06-30,"Of the many diplomatic items on the agenda for Barack Obama ’s bilateral meeting with Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff on Tuesday , one is conspicuous by its absence : a formal American apology for spying on her .
It is the Brazilian president ’s first state visit to Washington since Rousseff dramatically cancelled an earlier trip two years ago in the wake of the revelations from National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden that her emails , phone calls and text messages were under US surveillance .
Obama has pulled out all the stops to try to put the incident behind America and Brazil , including a visit to the Martin Luther King Jr memorial on Monday night that sought to underline their shared experience as civil rights champions and a grand state dinner at the White House capped with coconut banana opera cake .
Obama paved by the way for the visit during an encounter with Rousseff at the summit of the Americas in Panama , when he reassured her that his review of NSA practices meant it would not put allied leaders under surveillance in the future unless there was an overwhelming US security need .
“
He has made clear that with someone like Dilma Rousseff , who I think over the years he ’s had a good relationship with , he can speak directly with her and learn her views , ” said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes in a preview briefing with reporters .
“
That has allowed us to clear that air and has opened the door to moving forward with not just this visit but a much more energised bilateral agenda , ” he added .
“
So this visit I think really does indicate the extent to which we ’ve turned the page and are moving forward .
”
Except that amid all the clearing the air , it does not look like Rousseff will actually get the simple apology she requested .
Asked if Obama would say sorry , Rhodes – one of his closest advisers – replied : “ We have not made it a practice to issue apologies related to our surveillance activities .
”
Addressing the issue during her joint press conference with Obama , Rousseff acknowledged that her previous anger had led to her cancelling her last trip , but said trust had now been restored .
“ President Obama and the US government have stated on several occasions that they would no longer engage in intrusive acts of spying on friendly countries .
I believe President Obama , ” she said .
“
And furthermore , he has told me that should he ever need non - public information about Brazil , he would just pick up the phone and call me .
So yes , I am certain that the conditions today have become very different .
”
But Obama did not mention the allegations at all during his public remarks , calling for the two countries to “ focus on the future ” .
It is possible , of course , that such an expression of regret may still come out behind closed doors .
But the emphatic denial by senior White House aides suggests this issue is more than simply a matter of not wishing to officially confirm the spying once took place .
A similar silence was evident last week when François Hollande also rang Obama to demand an explanation for revelations of US spying on French presidents .
Although the Guardian asked Obama personally whether he would be apologising , there was no mention of the S - word when the White House released a summary of their call .
Only German chancellor Angela Merkel , whose rage came closest to Rousseff ’s at the Snowden revelations , actually secured a rare public apology over the affair , but that was perhaps also related to the fact that the US has more to worry about in its relationship with Europe ’s dominant power .
Brazil did exact some revenge – pointedly awarding a major military contract to Swedish - owned Gripen rather than the American favourite , Boeing – but both governments are now keen to move on with their stalled trade and defence relationship .
Yet observers of the relationship between the two great powers suggest this week ’s summit will mainly be about re - establishing trust before anything more substantial can be achieved .
“
The Brazilians felt that the relationship was a friendship
and I think they took it to heart
and they felt insulted .
It meant a lot to them , ” says Carl Meacham , director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
In this respect , Meacham believes US stubbornness over making a Merkel - style apology may be mistaken .
“
I believe that in foreign affairs you need to be pragmatic and realistic , and it ’s important to acknowledge whatever grievances they have , ” he adds .
“
If that involves talking about regret , so be it . ”"
2015-07-16,"The Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , has been warned that she could face impeachment as powerful former allies sharpen their political daggers and public anger rises over corruption , inflation and unemployment .
The threat was made by the speaker of the lower house , Eduardo Cunha , whose Democratic Movement party ( better known by its Portuguese acronym PMDB ) is in open revolt against the Workers party government it has propped up since 2003 .
At a breakfast meeting with journalists ahead of a two - week parliamentary recess , Cunha said he would make a decision â€œwithin 30 daysâ€ � on whether to move forward on the removal of the president .
Cunha acknowledged that an impeachment , which would be the first since 1992 , would be a â€œbackwards step for democracyâ€ � but his willingness to consider the possibility was in marked contrast to his position in April when he was adamant that it would not go ahead .
Since then , however , Rousseff â€ “ who is just seven months into her second term
â€ “ has been weakened by a relentless tide of bad economic news , political setbacks and pressure from auditors , prosecutors and election monitors .
Unemployment is at a five - year high , inflation is nearly twice the governmentâ€ ™ s target , the value of wages has fallen about 5 % since May 2014 , and
the nationâ€ ™ s GDP is forecast to shrink this year by 1.3 %
â€ “ the worst fall in 25 years .
Meanwhile , the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into the siphoning of Â£1.3bn ( $ 1.4bn ) from the state - owned oil company Petrobras continues to ensnare senior figures in business and politics .
Fifty politicians from six parties have been implicated .
This month also saw the arrest of the Petrobras director Jorge Zelada , who was suggested for his post by the PMDB , and the seizure by police of luxury cars owned by senator â€ “ and former president â€ “ Fernando Collor de Mello .
Cunha is also under investigation .
Cunha was named on Thursday by one of the Lava Jato whistleblowers , Julius Camargo , who testified that the president of the chamber of deputies asked him for a $ 5 m bribe related to a Petrobras contract .
Cunha denies this claim .
But the scandal may also be moving closer to the doors of the presidential PalÃ¡cio do Planalto .
Ricardo Pessoa , who allegedly headed a group of construction company bosses that channeled money from Petrobras to political parties , has agreed a plea bargain .
According to Veja â€ “ a magazine that is fiercely critical of the government â€ “ Pessoa is prepared to reveal details of illicit donations to Rousseffâ€ ™ s campaign .
That is not the only threat to the president .
The court of audit is looking into allegations that the government illegally bumped social security payments on to state banks to dress up the fiscal balance sheet , which if proven could also lead to impeachment procedures .
Opposition leader AÃ
© cio Neves has warned darkly that the Rousseff administration is heading for an â€œinterruptionâ€ � .
An anti - government rally has been called for 16 August .
Rousseff has vowed to resist what she and her allies describe as an attempted coup .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to fall .
I wonâ€ ™ t .
I wonâ€ ™ t .
That would be too wimpy .
This is a political fight , â€ �
she said in an interview with the Folha de SÃ£o Paulo newspaper earlier this week .
Marta Arretche , a political science professor at the University of SÃ£o Paulo , said Cunhaâ€ ™ s threats might have more to do with his own fear of being arrested by prosecutors .
â€œWhat he is doing is attempting to affect the investigation by threatening impeachment , â€ � said Arretche .
â€œHe is trying to save his own skin , because of the situation that he is in.â€ � Even if impeachment proceedings are launched
, she said it is still far from certain that Rousseff will be removed , which would require a vote against the president by 342 lower house deputies and then 54 senators .
But support for Rousseff is ebbing away on the streets and inside her coalition .
According to an Ibope poll earlier this month , the presidentâ€ ™ s approval ratings have fallen to a dismal 9 % .
Cunha and other members of the PMDB have repeatedly humiliated Rousseff in congressional votes and statement .
The vice - president of the party , Michel Temer , said this week that the party â€ “ the biggest in Brazil
â€ “ are open to new alliances and a plan to put forward their own candidate at the next presidential election in 2018 .
More worrying still for the president are growing signs of dissent within her own party .
Her predecessor and former mentor Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has criticised the government for implementing austerity measures despite promising otherwise during last yearâ€ ™ s election and accused Workers party officials of being too focused on their careers .
On current trends , the ruling party will be massacred at next yearâ€ ™ s municipal elections , which also adds to the internal pressures on Rousseff .
Meanwhile Cunha , who is a possible challenger in 2018 if he survives the current scandal , appears to be revelling in his role of presidential - irritator - in - chief .
Ahead of the recess , he reminded journalists and politicians that public disgruntlement is only likely to grow .
â€œIf anyone thinks that congressmen will be relieved to have two weeks off , they are wrong .
The members will spend two week in their constituencies .
Deepening unemployment will increase the pressure on them , and they will come back even tougher on the government , â€ � he said .

2015-08-13,"After arguably the toughest week of her presidency , Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff faces a fresh outpouring of public frustration this weekend when opponents will stage mass anti - government demonstrations and call for her impeachment .
The protest on Sunday comes amid the biggest corruption scandal in the countryâ€ ™ s history , a growing catalogue of grim economic news and a recent poll indicating Rousseff is the most unpopular president since the return of democracy in 1985 .
Supporters believe she is the target of a coup .
Critics argue she is the victim of her own mismanagement .
Whatever the cause , it is evident that less than a year into her second term , the Workers party leader is still struggling to assert her authority .
Last week , Rousseffâ€ ™ s ruling coalition was weakened by the desertion of the Democratic Labor party and the Brazilian Labor party .
Erstwhile ally and lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha is now openly plotting against Rousseff .
With congress in revolt , the governmentâ€ ™ s austerity goals are being sabotaged by proposals to increase spending on police chiefs , prosecutors and lawyers .
This has eroded the confidence of financial markets , pushing the Brazilian real to a 12-year low against the dollar .
The economy was already in trouble .
GDP is forecast to shrink this year , while inflation and unemployment rise .
On Tuesday , Moodyâ€ ™ s downgraded Brazilâ€ ™ s credit rating to within a whisker of junk status .
Meanwhile , hanging over government and industry is the ongoing â€œLava Jatoâ€ � ( Car Wash ) investigation into the countryâ€ ™ s biggest ever corruption scandal , at oil firm Petrobras .
Jairo Nicolau , a political scientist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro , said the combination of the dire economy , governance problems and corruption scandal had created Brazilâ€ ™ s worst political turbulence in 30 years .
â€œI can not remember having seen a crisis like this .
Unlike others , there is no solution on the horizon .
No one knows how to get to the other side.â€ �
Public anger could be heard in many streets last Friday as residents opened their windows and clanged pots and pans in a traditional panelaÃ§o protest while Rousseff was speaking on television .
In the most recent poll by Dataolha last week , the presidentâ€ ™ s approval rating was a dismal 8 % compared to the 71 % who felt she was doing a bad or terrible job .
The only president to have fallen anywhere near as low was Fernando Collor de Mello , who resigned in 1992 during impeachment proceedings over a corruption scandal .
About two - thirds of voters support a similar ousting of Rousseff , according to Datafolha â€
“ even though there is no legal justification for impeachment .
The lead prosecutor in the Lava Jato investigation acknowledged last week that he had found no evidence that Rousseff was involved in the corruption scandal at Petrobras .
That makes impeachment unlikely , but dirty politics could still trump legal niceties .
The presidentâ€ ™ s enemies are considering several pretexts , including ongoing investigations into alleged budget irregularities and campaign finance violations .
A two - thirds majority in congress would be enough for them to launch impeachment hearings , during which the vice - president , Michel Temer , would hold power until a final decision is reached by the senate or supreme court .
This is the hope of the organisers of Sundayâ€ ™ s protest , which aims to add to the pressure on Rousseff to stand down .
Some have set up a scoreboard - style website , placarforadilma.com , to track the numbers of congressmen ready to support impeachment .
Fernando Guarnieri , a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University , says the presidentâ€ ™ s opponents are still some way from winning the numbers game in congress .
â€œThe question is arithmetic .
If there is no such majority there is no impeachment , â€ � Guarnieri said .
Whether there is the political will to go ahead with the move will be partly gauged by the scale and character of Sundayâ€ ™ s demonstration .
Unable to extinguish opposition on the streets or in congress , Rousseff has tried to create a fire - break in the senate .
On Monday night , she hosted a dinner at the Alvorado palace for her cabinet and 43 senators , who she asked to act a â€œforce of moderationâ€ � .
The president of the senate , Renan Calheiros , appeared to be on her side when he warned earlier that day
that the presidentâ€ ™ s
removal by congress would â€œset the country on fireâ€ � .
The Workers party plans to stage pro - Rousseff demonstrations of their own on Friday in conjunction with the Landless Workers Movement and the National Union of Students .
Former president Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has also gone on the counter - attack , blaming Brazilâ€ ™ s economic woes on international bankers .
â€œThe crisis was not born in BrasÃ­lia .
The crisis was born in the heartland of America , the crisis was born in the heart of Europe , â€ �
he said on Monday .
But the president is also losing support among traditional Workers party supporters .
Many are aggrieved by the governmentâ€ ™ s austerity programme , which has hurt core constituencies .
Last month , the government announced cuts of more than a billion reais ( Â£196 m ) from spending on both education and healthcare .
In contrast , the budget for agriculture and livestock was raised by 20 % , to maintain the backing of the farmers lobby , which Rousseff depends on for support ."
2015-08-16,"Tens of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets in cities across the country on Sunday , to protest against President Dilma Rousseff .
Angered by a massive , unfolding corruption scandal , an economy mired in recession and harsh austerity measures , many of the protesters called for the president ’s impeachment .
In São Paulo , an anti - government event drew around 135,000 , according to Datafolha , a polling institute .
Though significant , the numbers were down on a similar event in the city in March this year , which attracted 210,000 .
In Brasília , police numbered the crowd at around 25,000 .
Demonstrations took place in more than 200 cities , including Rio de Janeiro , Belo Horizonte and Salvador .
In Rio de Janeiro , thousands marched along Copacabana
’s
Avenida Atlântica , many dressed in the yellow and green of the Brazilian football team .
The crowd followed six mobile sound - systems , each commandeered by a different protest movement , loudly broadcasting a mixture of anti - government speeches and music .
According to the newspaper O Folha de São Paulo , which cited anonymous government sources , around 200,000 took part in the marches , excluding those in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo – fewer than the government had feared .
In the shade of one of the few trees along the route , Marcia Regina , 55 , a teacher from Rio ’s Northern Zone , took a break from hammering banners bearing anti - government messages on to wooden poles .
“ I ca n’t stand being in a country where I have to pay such high taxes to get nothing whatsoever in return , ” she said .
“
In our health system , we are treated like wild animals .
In terms of public safety , we are just treated as statistics .
Do n’t even talk to me about education .
They think we are all stupid .
”
With families and friends snapping selfies and socialising under a baking mid - winter sun , the demonstration was good - humoured .
But the participants were unmistakably angry .
Atop one of the sound systems , a man dressed as Captain America reminded the crowd that “ this is not Carnival ” .
João - Luiz Garcia , 31 , an engineer , gathered signatures for a petition to force congress to debate anti - corruption measures .
A voter for Rousseff ’s predecessor , Lula da Silva , Garcia said he had been sold a dream that Brazil could change .
“
What happened was the opposite .
Economic power became even more concentrated , ” he said .
“
The people close to the government benefited much more than the rest of the population .
”
A minority of the protesters demanded military intervention if the president refused to stand down .
Angela Tenorio , 62 , a doctor whose televised tirade against the inadequacies of the public health system went viral in 2012 , attended the march holding a banner with a picture of Rousseff as the Terminator , under the slogan “ Exterminator of the Future ” .
“
I do n’t just want her out of power , ” she said .
“
I want her out of the country .
I want the return of the armed forces , because we do n’t have politicians , we have thieves .
The political parties are criminal factions .
The military have to take care of the country .
”
The leftwing Partido dos Trabalhadores ( PT ) has been in power for more than 12 years .
Many of the demonstrators accused it of institutionalising corruption .
Earlier this month , one of the party ’s founders , José Dirceu , was arrested , suspected of orchestrating a multibillion dollar bribery scandal at the state oil company , Petrobras .
Over the past year , “ Operation Car Wash ” , a police investigation into corruption at the oil firm , has resulted in the arrests of dozens of leading industrialists .
More than 50 politicians , mainly from the ruling coalition , have been accused of involvement in the scheme .
A criminal investigation has also been opened into former president Lula , over allegations of illegal influence - peddling in the years since he left office .
With the economy expected to contract around 2 % this year , inflation nearing 10 % and unemployment rising ,
anger at the country ’s political elite is growing .
The president ’s approval rating is in single digits , and a recent survey found that two - thirds of Brazilians wish to see her impeached , despite the fact there is no clear - cut legal case for her removal .
The pro - impeachment lobby in congress is short of the votes it needs to initiate proceedings .
Over the past week , Rousseff has strengthened her relationship with the senate president , Renan Calheiros , in a move that could help her avoid impeachment .
Raul Gotlieb , 64 , an engineer attending the protest in Rio , said he believed demonstrating widespread popular outrage was key to persuading congress to impeach the president .
As to whether the protests received sufficient support , he said the turnout was better than he expected .
“
But it ’s far less than we should have , ” he said .
“
There should be 40 million people on the streets .
”"
2015-08-22,"If the sight of hundreds of thousands of Brazilians taking to the streets last Sunday demanding her impeachment perturbed President Dilma Rousseff , she showed no sign of it .
That evening , she consulted five of her closest ministers to discuss the governmentâ€ ™ s response .
They settled on a simple strategy : say nothing .
While arguably there was nothing to be said , the silence was also a hallmark of Rousseff , a former Marxist guerrilla who became her countryâ€ ™ s first woman president .
â€œShe trusts very few people ,
â€ � Mauricio Savarese , a Brazilian political reporter and blogger , said .
â€œShe runs her government like a communist cell.â€ �
This has proved both a strength and a weakness in a colourful career from student activist to technocrat to leader of the worldâ€ ™ s seventh largest economy .
In the 1970s , Rousseff was imprisoned and tortured during the military dictatorship without giving up the names of her comrades in the Marxist underground .
Today , however , her unwillingness to engage in debate and build alliances is widely seen as a key factor in a political crisis that has seen her become the most unpopular president since the return of democracy in 1985 .
Less than a year into her second term , the president is struggling with a fragmenting coalition , a faltering economy and the biggest corruption scandal in the countryâ€ ™ s history .
Hostility was only to be expected from the rich , white , middle - class families , but Rousseff has also disappointed many of those who put her into power .
Her predecessor , Luis InÃ¡cio Lula de Silva , built a broad coalition that embraced unions , student radicals , environmentalists and many in the middle class .
His government was idealistically proactive on climate change , deforestation and foreign policy and pragmatic in its approach to the economy .
Under Rousseff , however , the Workers party has lost its shine .
Diplomats privately admit the president has little interest in foreign policy .
Environmentalists condemn her approval of a weakened forest code , dam - building in the Amazon and fossil fuel development by Petrobras .
Before her first presidential election campaign , in 2010 , Rousseff had never run for elected office .
In stark contrast to Lula , she lacks personal warmth .
After she had plastic surgery in 2008 to soften her appearance , a widely circulated joke asked when she was going to get a personality makeover .
Famed for her aggressive micro - management , she has little time for her own ministers .
â€œShe doesnâ€ ™ t like politicians .
She is a technocrat , â€ �
Savarese said .
â€œ
The flipside of her abrasive character is a solid reputation for honesty .
Not even her enemies accuse her of corruption .
In a recent interview with the German magazine , Capital , former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso , of the opposition Brazilian Social Democratic party ( PSDB ) , described her as â€œhonourableâ€ � .
Under her presidency , prosecutors have unearthed more wrongdoing than ever before .
But her unwillingness to engage in the boysâ€ ™ club of Brazilian politics , where less than 9 % of congress is female and corruption is routine , explains in part her current problems .
As minister for mines and energy under Lula , she took an undisguised dislike to Eduardo Cunha , then an ambitious congressman with an interest in the energy sector .
During her first inauguration , she broke protocol by leaving Congress through the door she had entered , purely to avoid having to shake his hand as he waited by the exit .
Cunha , now speaker of the lower house , appears not to have forgiven or forgotten that slight .
Despite belonging to party nominally allied to Rousseffâ€ ™ s , he ran against her candidate for the speakership and won .
Since then , he has proved the sharpest thorn in Rousseffâ€ ™ s side .
Her attempts to rein in spending and raise taxes to sort out public finances have been thwarted by a hostile Congress , orchestrated by Cunha .
Moreover , the tabling of impeachment proceedings is his prerogative alone .
He has given indications he is willing to follow that route .
But on Thursday , the attorney generalâ€ ™ s office charged Cunha with corruption and money - laundering , relating to a $ 5 m bribe he allegedly took as part of the Petrobras scandal .
â€œThis has given her something of a respite , â€ �
David Fleischer , a professor of politics at the University of BrasÃ­lia , said .
â€œCunhaâ€ ™ s role has been weakened somewhat .
But of course , what could happen is that he just becomes so angryâ€ ¦ that he goes after the president .
We canâ€ ™ t be sure how he will react.â€
�
Throughout the crisis , she has confided in just a few close advisers , chief among them ex - husband , Carlos AraÃºjo .
Rousseff and AraÃºjo met while both were active in leftwing militant groups in the late 1960s .
Both were jailed and tortured .
After the return of democracy , they settled in the southern city of Porto Alegre where AraÃºjo , a labour lawyer , helped found the Democratic Workers party ( PDT ) .
The couple had a daughter , Paula , born in 1976 ; they separated in 2000 , but remain close .
According to Rosane de Oliveira , a columnist for Zero Hora ,
Porto Alegreâ€ ™ s main newspaper , who has known Rousseff since the mid-1980s , AraÃºjo is one of the few people she trusts and whose advice she heeds .
Rousseff returns to Porto Alegre regularly .
Family is one of the few ways she unwinds , principally by watching Peppa Pig with her grandson , Gabriel , though she has told interviewers that her favourite films include 2001 :
A Space Odyssey and The Seduction of Mimi .
In the week before the demonstrations , AraÃºjo travelled to BrasÃ­lia to spend time with her .
Back in Porto Alegre last week , he told Oliveira that there is no way Rousseff would even consider resigning .
â€œRemember that she was tortured and she never betrayed her colleagues , â€ � Oliveira said .
Rousseff has surprised her detractors before .
She was a controversial choice to follow Lula , but initially proved a hit with voters , easily winning in 2010 and then riding an economic boom and pushing a wealth redistribution policy to notch up approval ratings of 80 % .
The subsequent slowdown in growth eroded her standing , but she was still able to ride out street protests in 2013 and jeers from World Cup crowds the following year to secure re - election in 2014 .
In retrospect , that may have been a good campaign to lose .
Shorn of support in the legislature , Rousseff has compromised and compromised , accepting an austerity policy to placate the markets and inviting a motley crew of ideological opponents into her cabinet .
She had little choice , but the outcome has satisfied no one and dismayed many .
Frei Betto , a leftwing Dominican friar , grew up on the same street in Belo Horizonte as the president .
During the dictatorship , they worked together against the military government .
He is now alarmed that Rousseffâ€ ™ s ditching of her principles will have dire consequences : â€œMy biggest concern is that the fiscal tightening wonâ€ ™ t work and the people are being sacrificed .
This would cause a total loss of her credibility and the credibility of the Workerâ€ ™ s party.â€ �
Part of her problem was her leadership style , he said .
Although she listens to alternative views , she rarely engages in debate and often ignores advice .
â€œShe is the wrong person for a system that demands a different kind of president , â€ � says Ricardo Sennes , of the influential Gacint - USP thinktank .
He traces Brazilâ€ ™ s current crisis
â€ “ the downturn , Lava Jato corruption scandal and ungovernable congress â€ “ back to 2011 - 12 when the coalition that Lula put together began to unravel with the departure of the Brazilian Socialist party ( PSB ) .
Since then , allies have steadily abandoned the ruling camp .
Sennes believes the result is not polarisation , but fragmentation .
â€œNo one has a majority and everyone is blocking everyone else .
I think this will go on until 2018 , because there isnâ€ ™ t even a majority to remove Dilma.â€
�
If he is right , Rousseff and Brazil will have to muddle through .
The alternatives â€ “ resignation , impeachment or a coup â€ “ would probably be worse .
This dilemma appears to have been recognised by business leaders and the mainstream media , which have recently toned down their calls for the removal of the president for fear of the country losing its investor - grade credit rating .
The irony of this will not lost on Rousseff , who may be wishing she had never won a second term â€ “ as if she would ever share such a thought .
THE ROUSSEFF FILE Born Dilma Vana Rousseff on 14 December 1947 .
Her father , an ex - communist Bulgarian immigrant , was a lawyer and entrepreneur .
Her mother worked as a school teacher .
Growing up , she dreamed of becoming a ballerina , though this was quickly replaced by ambitions to join the leftwing movement against Brazilâ€ ™ s military dictatorship .

2015-09-21,"Israel has defended its choice of ambassador to Brazil , following reports that President Dilma Rousseff has rejected the nomination of Dani Dayan over his links with the settler movement .
Speaking on Monday , Tzipi Hotoveli , the deputy minister for foreign affairs , said that Dayan was “ the right person to represent Israel at this moment in Brazil ” .
Dayan , 59 , the former head of the Yesha Council , which represents the Jewish settlements in the West Bank , was approved by the administration of Benjamin Netanyahu on 6 September .
But more than 40 Brazilian social movements , including some of Rousseff ’s supporters , have signed a petition calling on the government to reject Dayan ’s appointment over his “ acts in clear violation of international laws and the basic rights of the Palestinian people ” .
A report published on Sunday by the Israeli newspaper , Yedioth Ahronoth , claimed that Rousseff has expressed her displeasure at Dayan ’s appointment via private channels .
Before sending an ambassador , diplomatic protocol dictates that foreign governments request permission from the host country , known as an “ agrément ” .
It is extremely rare for a government to refuse publicly to accept an ambassador , meaning that most rejections are conveyed privately .
Itamaraty , the Brazilian foreign office , declined a request for an interview , stating that it does not comment during the process of agrément .
Without mentioning Rousseff ’s reported misgivings , Hotoveli said that Dayan ’s “ public trajectory and ideology ought to be an advantage , and not a disadvantage in representing the position of the current government , which supports our right to settlements in Judea and Samaria ” .
Born in Buenos Aires in 1959 , Dayan ran the Yesha Council from 2007 to 2013 , defending the interests of the settlers in the West Bank , now estimated to number 550,000 .
In a New York Times editorial from July 2012 , Dayan described the two - state solution as a “ failed formula ” and insisted that the presence of settlers in “ all of Judea and Samaria – not just in the so - called settlement blocs – is an irreversible fact ” .
He currently lives in the settlement of Ma’ale Shomrom .
Despite deepening economic ties , diplomatic relations between Israel and Brazil have rarely been smooth during the 12 years of rule by the leftwing Workers party .
Last year , Brazil recalled its ambassador from Israel after a foreign ministry spokesman labelled the South American country a “ diplomatic dwarf ” over Brasília ’s criticism of the Israeli incursion in Gaza .
On announcing Dayan ’s nomination in August this year , Netanyahu expressed hope for a stronger relationship .
“
Israel is focused on developing its economic relations with South America , with an emphasis on Brazil , ” he said ."
2015-10-02,"Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has cut her own salary by 10 % , slashed eight ministries and reshuffled her cabinet in an attempt to ward off an escalating political and economic crisis .
The shakeup , which comes less than a year after she formed a second - term government , is designed to stave off an impeachment threat in Congress and a collapse of investor confidence .
Rousseff said the reshuffle would â€œguarantee the political stability of the nationâ€ � and â€œstrengthen relations between the parties and members of parliament who support the governmentâ€ � .
Mauro Rochlin , an economist at the GetÃºlio Vargas Foundation , said the savings were minuscule compared to the necessary cuts of 30bn Reais .
â€œThe government wants to show that they are willing to cut their own flesh , â€ � he said .
â€œBut this is a drop in the ocean .
The value of this is symbolic.â€ �
Many on the left recognise that Brazilâ€ ™ s bureaucracy , which saw the addition of thousand of commissions during the boom years , is bloated , though they oppose austerity .
â€œThe government has become big and foolish , and lost its management capacity .
So from that point of view , this change is very welcome , â€ � said Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo , an advisor to former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva .
â€œThis is the start of an improvement in the quality of the state.â€ �
But the new measures highlight the weakness of a president who is faced by a hostile Congress , an unhappy public and a punishing financial climate .
Despite the overall reduction of ministries from 39 to 31 , Rousseff has given an extra post to centre - right coalition partner PMDB ( the Portuguese acronym for Democratic Movement Party of Brazil ) , which is now more dominant than ever in both the Cabinet and Congress .
This is evidently an attempt to fend off an ouster vote , which has been repeatedly threatened by the Lower House speaker Eduardo Cunha and would require a two - thirds majority .
Even if this is averted , the president has a host of other headaches .
The administrative reforms and 10 % pay cut for all ministers are designed to show the government is sharing a little of the fiscal pain that has been imposed on voters in the form of cuts to healthcare and housing programs .
But they are unlikely to make much of a difference to a budget shortfall that led last month to Brazilâ€ ™ s sovereign debt rating being cut to junk status .
A sceptical public also need far more convincing that Rousseff has the answers to the nationâ€ ™ s growing problems .
Close to a million jobs have been lost in the past year as the economy has slipped into recession thanks to falling global commodity prices , weakening domestic demand and a massive corruption scandal that has hit the nationâ€ ™ s biggest company Petrobras and dozens of other major firms .
The presidentâ€ ™ s popularity is at rock bottom .
Last month , a poll by Ibope showed she has support from only 10 % of the public ."
2015-10-09,"Dilma Rousseff , Brazilâ€ ™ s president who no longer really governs the country , is becoming an increasingly tragic figure with each day that passes .
But the real tragedy is that of the Brazilian nation .
It is too early to say that the impeachment of the countryâ€ ™ s first female president is a certainty .
Although this outcome has become more likely after the rejection by the federal court of accounts of the financial reports relating to 2014 , the end of her first term in office , for many it is not enough of a reason to oust a democratically elected president .
The biggest drama , however , is one that will not draw to a close if Rousseff remains in power or if she stands down .
It is that of a country that for so many generations saw itself as having a future that never came to be , but finally believed it had got there with the election of Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva to the presidency in 2003 and the upward mobility of millions of Brazilians , and yet now finds itself mired in the past once again .
There are few virtues on display in Brazilâ€ ™ s current drama and even fewer virtuous players .
To try to remain in the presidency by keeping the coalition intact , Rousseff has to back - scratch the president of the senate , Renan Calheiros , a shady figure who some years ago had to resign to avoid being removed from office on corruption charges .
Her most conspicuous nemesis is Eduardo Cunha , the president of the chamber of deputies , who is currently being investigated by the federal police as part of the so - called Operation Carwash , and whose Swiss bank accounts have already been discovered .
This operation is investigating a large - scale money laundering scheme involving the state - run oil company , Petrobras , major contractors and Brazilian politicians .
The president who , at least to date , has never been suspected of using public money for personal gain , is being threatened by politicians who make a habit of collecting corruption allegations , without this appearing to cause the nation the sense of shock that it should .
Both her occasional ally Calheiros , who can of course change his position at any moment , and her enemy Cunha , who waves the impeachment flag when it suits him , belong to the same party , the PMDB ( the Democratic Movement party ) , as does her own vice - president , Michel Temer .
This â€œcoincidenceâ€ � could be easily dismissed as farcical , were the PMDBâ€ ™ s actions not a deliberate strategy to hold and share power throughout the entire process of re - democratisation in Brazil .
Cunha , who should already have been removed from the presidency of the chamber of deputies if ethics were a real concern of the parliament , still feels he has the backing of his peers to point the finger at the president .
And so Rousseff is being dragged back down again every time she thinks she has glimpsed a way out
â€ “ or at least a way to remain in office until 2018 , even with virtually no real power any more .
The real tragedy is that in this political drama those involved are almost all villains .
Within the PSDB ( Social Democratic party ) , which narrowly lost the elections to the PT ( Workersâ€ ™ party ) in 2014 , every political hopeful is in search of a strategy to guarantee a seat in government , putting their personal ambitions above the interests of the country .
There is no shortage of plans to obtain power among the PTâ€ ™ s opposition , but concrete plans for the country itself are flimsier than those giant inflatable Dilma or Lula dolls dressed as convicts that can frequently be seen in current street protests .
Not even those protesters who recently occupied public spaces to demand the presidentâ€ ™ s impeachment represent an effective force for change , as happened in the protests of June 2013 .
The 2015 protesters have made Cunha their major ally , which makes any anti - corruption discourse a joke .
Among them , there are also a few that advocate the return of a military dictatorship , raising their banners in praise of the regime that tortured and executed Brazilians just a few decades ago .
Taking selfies with a police force that kills the highest number of citizens in the world has also become a sad tradition in the recent street protests calling for impeachment .
These are the same protesters who want to â€œmoraliseâ€ � the country .
The countryâ€ ™ s drama is also about mediocrity , since the quality of the play depends on the quality of the players .
The level of political debate is as sophisticated as a casual conversation overheard on a bus .
In the absence of compelling alternatives , disenchantment gives way to cynicism , a much more dangerous noun .
To believe that the major issue facing Brazil today is the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff or her struggle to hold on to power would be naive .
What is at stake is also the inexhaustible capacity on the part of the countryâ€ ™ s elites to feign indignation in order to create more space to re - establish their interests and keep their privileges intact .
Brazilâ€ ™ s problem , then , is not this particular conflict , but rather the failure to address the real conflicts .
These include the incomplete process of abolishing slavery , abysmal economic inequality , and racial and social apartheid , which are non - existent debates .
Both Lula and Dilmaâ€ ™ s governments chose to accommodate these historical frameworks rather than tackling them head on .
The biggest drama currently facing Brazil is not the economic crisis or Dilma Rousseffâ€ ™ s incompetence , or even the corruption within the PT .
Brazilâ€ ™ s drama is obscenity ."
2015-10-15,"With its sleek modernist design and daring lines , the National Congress building in Brasília appeared to be the perfect symbol of the creativity and idealism of a young nation when it opened in the early 1960s .
Little more than 50 years on , however , it is the setting for a chaotic and demeaning political battle that has even long - term parliament watchers shaking their heads in disbelief .
Brazil desperately needs strong leadership to overcome the country ’s worst economic crisis in decades , but the most powerful figures in the country ’s government and legislature – president Dilma Rousseff and the speaker of the lower house Eduardo Cunha – are inching ever closer to an impeachment showdown .
It is a spectacularly unedifying spectacle that pits the most unpopular president in history against a politician who has been repeatedly tainted by corruption scandals .
Every new development seems only to make them – and the system they represent – look more flawed .
Last week , Rousseff ’s government was found guilty of fudging public accounts to cover up shortfalls , raising the possibility that she could face an ouster vote in a hostile congress .
Days later , Cunha was revealed to have several undeclared Swiss bank accounts .
The two combatants seem locked in a kind of death by 1,000 defamations .
In the underground walkways , office corridors and rooftop restaurants of the Oscar Niemeyer building , conspiracies swirl along with speculation about how long they can remain standing .
But this is not just about the two figures in the limelight .
Dozens of other congressmen implicated in scandals – including the vice - president , the head of the upper house and the two deputy speakers of the lower house – and parliamentary veterans say the situation is far more chaotic and unpredictable now than during the 1992 impeachment of the then president Fernando Collor de Mello .
“
There are crises now of politics , economics and ethics , ” said Arnaldo Jordy , deputy leader of the opposition Popular Socialist party , who has been in congress for 29 years .
“
I ’ve never known this multiplicity of overlapping crises .
”
Brasília is distracted by impeachment talks and paralysed by a shift in the economic winds .
Recession has eaten into the government ’s ability to secure votes with pork - barrel projects .
The massive Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into billions of dollars of bribes and kickbacks at the state - run oil company Petrobrashas choked the slush funds that previously oiled the wheels of government .
Generous travel perks have been trimmed in a fiscal readjustment .
Parliamentarians are unhappy .
But they are unlikely to get any public sympathy .
The legislature fails to reflect Brazil ’s population , with just 13 % of elected positions held by women and only 3 % held by black politicians ( although black and mixed - race people constitute more than half of the country ’s 200 million people ) .
Instead , the chambers are filled with white men , an alarming number of whom are alleged criminals .
As of last month , 141 deputies ( almost 30 % of the lower house ) and 31 senators ( almost 40 % of the upper house ) were being investigated for crimes , including corruption , money laundering , electoral fraud and incitement to rape , according to the watchdog group Congresso em Foco .
Previous congresses have included politicians accused of drug trafficking , kidnapping and murder .
Few are ever convicted because politicians enjoyed a high degree of impunity .
Their cases must be dealt with by the supreme court , which usually files them away until they expire .
According to Sylvio Costa , the editor of Congresso em Foco , almost 200 parliamentarians are currently facing criminal charges .
“
The worst rises to the top because of the way we do politics , exchanging money for power .
”
Cunha – the speaker of the house – is allegedly the master of this dark art .
In the Brazilian media , he is presented as a figure so sinister he is almost comical , resembling the Simpsons’ Mr Burns but acting like Frank Underwood in House of Cards .
His fellow deputies speak of him in awed – almost fearful – tones .
“
In all my time in politics , he ’s the most machiavellian figure ,
” says Ivan Valente , who has served seven terms as the president of leftwing opposition party PSOL .
“
Cunha is a politician who is opportunistic , intelligent , ambitious and corrupt .
People ca n’t claim to be against corruption and then support Cunha .
But that ’s what the rightwing opposition do .
They close their eyes .
”
It has become increasingly difficult to do that .
An informer in the Lava Jato investigation claims Cunha took $ 5 m in kickbacks .
Opponents this week lodged a motion in the lower house ethics committee demanding that he be removed from office .
This week , the supreme court limited Cunha ’s powers , and government supporters claim their nemesis is now a fatally weakened figure .
“
The speaker of the house has no moral credibility to launch impeachment proceedings .
What we are seeing now in congress is a shift towards his removal , ” said Silvio Costa , a deputy leader of the house from the government camp .
But he acknowledged that if the necessary majority of the 25 ethics committee members supported the motion – which currently looks unlikely – it would take at least 90 days to remove him from office .
Cunha is far from finished .
His signature is all that is needed to take any one of the 12 impeachment motions to the floor of the house .
He also knows many secrets .
Congressmen whisper that if he falls , he will bring others down with him .
He also maintains considerable support .
Cunha – an evangelical Christian – has built a power base among the main conservative blocks – the ruralistas ( agribusiness lobby ) , the fundamentalistas ( religious groups ) and the bancada da bala ( “ bullet lobby ” of congressmen close to the military and police ) by pushing bills on family values and weakening those on disarmament of the security forces and indigenous land demarcation .
He is also widely rumoured to have used his connections to bankroll dozens of deputies .
In normal circumstances , the opening of an impeachment vote would require a two - thirds majority in the 513-member lower house .
For now , Rousseff appears secure but the maths could change .
Cunha has vowed to launch a challenge at the supreme court on Friday that – if successful – could pave the way for an impeachment vote that would require only a simple majority to proceed .
Complicating matters further are rifts within the biggest party in congress , the Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) , a party which concentrates more on power than any defined ideology and which has dominated Brazilian politics for the past 30 years .
The presidential prospects of its two most prominent leaders – Vice - President Michel Temer and Cunha – vary according to what happens next .
If Dilma , as the president is popularly known , is ousted in the last two years of her mandate , Temer will see out the remainder of the term .
As a result , there are very different levels of urgency among supporters of these two PMDB leaders .
Wellington Moreira Franco , a PMDB strategist who is close to Temer , insists impeachment should not be rushed .
Currently , he said there was not enough support among institutions and industry to proceed with such a grave step .
But he predicted pressure will build as the gravity of Brazil ’s economic woes becomes more evident .
“
We ’re closer to impeachment than two or three months ago .
The momentum is not sufficient yet , but I think it will come , ” he said in his top - floor office .
Others , particularly those in the opposition camp , are reluctant to wait .
They say Dilma is using delaying tactics to wear down support for change .
“ Time is running against us .
The longer we leave it , the more likely it is that public attention will be diverted elsewhere , ” said Cristiane Brazil , a lower house deputy from the PTB who dined at Cunha ’s home this week .
With an election looming next year , she said the last chance was a rally on 15 November .
“
We will mobilise the public so deputies ca n’t resist the call for impeachment .
”
Others are also impatient for change .
“
I hope a year from now that both Dilma and Cunha will be out of their posts .
Then Brazil would have a chance to recover and to have a government with the political legitimacy it needs to deal with this crisis , ” said Jordy , who said he would vote tomorrow to remove them both if he had the chance .
It is doubtful that this would solve Brazil ’s governance problems , which go far deeper than a couple of conflicting personalities .
The most widely expressed hope in congress was that another branch of government – the judiciary – will prove the most positive force for change .
Amid corruption scandals and investigations , a new generation of idealistic judges , prosecutors and federal police is becoming far more popular than the nation ’s elected representatives .
Some predict that the outcome of the investigations – more than any impeachment debate – will shape the future of the country .
“
I think we ’re going to see the greatest jailing of congressmen in world history , ” said Silvio Costa .
“
And this will be a positive thing for Brazil .
”"
2015-12-02,"Brazilâ€ ™ s president Dilma Rousseff has begun the fight for her political life after the first impeachment proceedings for more than 20 years were launched against her in Congress .
After months of jockeying , the removal proceedings were pushed forward by her political nemesis â€ “ the lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha â€ “ as Brazil slipped deeper into a crisis that has hamstrung decision - making even while the economy suffers its worst downturn since the Great Depression .
On Wednesday night , Cunha finally gave the green light to an opposition motion for the countryâ€ ™ s first female president to be ejected from office on allegations that she broke fiscal laws by window dressing government accounts ahead of her re - election last year .
Rousseff came out fighting .
â€œI have received with indignation the decision by the head of the lower chamber to [ launch ] the impeachment process , â€ � she said .
â€œThere is no wrongful act committed by me , nor are there any suspicions that I have misused public money.â€ �
In a televised address to the nation , Rousseff expressed her â€œoutrageâ€ � at Cunhaâ€ ™ s decision and said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by her .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve committed no illicit act , there is no suspicion hanging over me of any misuse of public money , â€ � the president said .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t have any offshore bank accounts , I have no hidden assets.â€
�
Her comment was a direct jab at Cunha , who has been charged with taking millions in bribes in connection to a kickbacks scheme that has embroiled state - run oil company Petrobras .
Activists from the ruling Workers Party accuse Cunha and his supporters of plotting a coup .
Earlier this year , Cunha acknowledged that an impeachment , which would be the first since 1992 , would be a â€œbackwards step for democracyâ€ � .
For months , he has sat on more than half a dozen previous opposition proposals to remove an elected head of state who has served only one year of her four - year mandate .
However , he has changed his tone as his own position has come under threat .
Julius Camargo , one of the whistleblowers in the Lava Jato investigation into corruption at Petrobras , has testified that the Cunha asked him for a $ 5 m bribe â€ “ a claim that the speaker denies .
As pressure on Cunha mounted on Wednesday , he finally accepted a case lodged by opposition lawyers HÃ © lio Bicudo , Miguel Reale and JanaÃ­na Paschoal .
It appeared at least partly motivated by self - defence , coming just hours after lawmakers the Workers Party ethics committee announced plans to seek his dismissal on grounds of corruption .
Cunha dismissed the idea that his decision was motivated by personal or political reasons .
â€œThe basis of this [ impeachment proceeding ] is purely technical , â€ � he claimed .
On his Facebook page , he wrote that he was responding to the demands of anti - government protests earlier this year .
â€œThe demonstrations that took place throughout Brazil â€ “ on March 15 , April 12 and August 16
â€ “ were not in vain!â€ � he wrote .
â€œThe [ impeachment ] process will be followed by the entire population.â€ �
To proceed , the removal proposal needs the support of at least two - thirds of the deputies , or 342 of the 513 votes in the lower house .
If that is successful , Rousseff will have to hand over power to vice - president , Michel Temer â€ “ who is from the same Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) as Cunha â€ “ for several months while an inquiry is conducted by the senate .
A final decision would then have to be approved by a two - thirds majority in the upper house .
Rousseff , who won a narrow but uncontested mandate , may have the votes needed to remain in power , but the escalation of conflict between two of the countryâ€ ™ s most powerful figures looks set to worsen the already gloomy outlook for Brazil .
Luciano Dias , a political consultant at the Brasilia - based Analise Politica firm , said : â€œThe chances of President Rousseff being impeached arenâ€ ™ t as big as politicians say now , despite this bold move by Cunha.â€ � â€œThey are not insignificant , but they are not huge.â€ �
The impeachment debate adds to an already long list of problems for the president : the worst scandal in the countryâ€ ™ s history , popularity ratings that have slumped into single digits and a worsening recession .
The latest economic figures this week showed Brazil is now heading for its worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Unemployment is at a five - year high , inflation is nearly twice the governmentâ€ ™ s target , the value of wages has fallen about 5 % since May 2014 , and
the nationâ€ ™ s GDP is forecast to shrink this year by about 4 % ."
2015-12-03,"Allies of the Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , have rallied congressional supporters as the Workers party leader tried to head off the first impeachment vote against a president in more than 20 years .
Following approval by the lower house speaker the previous evening , the 2,000-word case against the president was read out on Thursday in the chamber of deputies .
The motion â€ “ which took more than an hour to read â€ “ claimed that Rousseff was guilty of fiscal wrongdoing because she manipulated government accounts to the tune of 2.5bn reais ( $ 668 m ) .
A special committee will now be set up in the lower house to decide whether to recommend a formal investigation , which would require approval by two - thirds of the deputies in the chamber .
It remains unclear if the opposition will have enough votes to pass the motion but the move to impeach is likely to dominate Brazilâ€ ™ s political agenda for months , and adds to the problems of a president who is already struggling with recession , a fractious congress and the worst corruption scandal in recent memory .
Loyalists began rallying support for Rousseff on Thursday morning , as communications minister , Ricardo Berzoini , called a meeting of party leaders from the ruling coalition to ensure that they have sufficient support to kill the impeachment move in the lower house .
Most analysts believe the government will succeed , and even if the issue progresses to the upper house , Rousseff should be safe as she is thought to have the backing of 54 of the 81 senators .
Government lawyers are also seeking an injunction in the supreme court to quash the process .
But Rousseffâ€ ™ s principal tormentor , speaker Eduardo Cunha , kept up his attack on Thursday , accusing the president of â€œlying to the nationâ€ � in a televised address on Thursday night .
Rousseff had claimed that she was not involved in any bargaining over the impeachment move , but the speaker said she had offered incentives to his allies .
If there were indeed any secret talks , they evidently failed to make headway :
Cunha â€ “ who is himself under investigation over claims that he illicitly received up to $ 40 m , some of which was kept in secret Swiss bank accounts â€
“ gave the green light to the impeachment case after Workers party lawmakers announced that they would try to have him removed from office at a vote in the ethics committee .
Clean - government campaigner Sylvio Costa of Congresso em Foco (
Congress in Focus ) said Cunhaâ€ ™ s motives could undermine his case .
â€œItâ€ ™ s clear that he accepted the impeachment motion because Workers party members pushed ahead with an investigation into his conduct .
To open this process as a form of retaliation complicates matters .
Itâ€ ™ s explicit blackmail.â€
�
This is not the only weakness in the case against the president .
Pablo Holmes , a lawyer and professor of political science at the University of BrasÃ­lia , said it was doubtful that opponents will be able to prove Rousseff has committed a crime .
â€œItâ€ ™ s very risky to start a process such as this without legal clarity , â€ � he said .
â€œImpeachment is not a means to depose an unpopular president .
The risks for democracy are too high.â€ �
But with so many variables , Holmes said it was hard to foresee the outcome .
â€œI used to believe impeachment would be too difficult , but from what Iâ€ ™ ve been hearing from congress , it now seems there is a possibility .
Itâ€ ™ s unpredictable.â€
�
In a worst - case scenario for the president , her opponents would cut a deal between two of the biggest parties â€ “ the PMDB and PSDB â€ “ to secure sufficient votes for the impeachment process to move ahead .
Much is likely to depend on the role played by Vice - President Michel Temer , a PMDB leader who is currently allied to the government but also stands to benefit if Rousseff is forced to step down temporarily while she is being investigated .
On the day the impeachment was announced , he was seen speaking to opposition politicians .
Others believe deeper forces are at play .
Following the election of centre - right politician Mauricio Macri as Argentinaâ€ ™ s president , they believe the impeachment move has been timed to increase the momentum away from the leftist governments that have dominated many countries in the region for the past decade .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a very complex game ,
â€ � observed LÃºcio FlÃ¡vio Rodrigues de Almeida , a political scientist at the Pontifical University of SÃ£o Paulo .
â€œBrazilâ€ ™ s case should be seen within a Latin American process , where the leftwing governments are being dismantled by a rightwing political plan .
Not all commentators were as pessimistic in their analysis .
Some have have argued that , after months of stagnation , an open fight and a clear decision might allow the return of effective government .
â€œIf there is anything positive in this news , it is the end of the paralysis in which Brazil was hostage to BrasÃ­lia , â€ � wrote Bernardo Mello Franco in Folha de SÃ£o Paulo .
â€œWhile the government was being blackmailed by Cunha , it could not rule .
Now the political system will have to return to choosing one side or the other.â€ �"
2015-12-08,"Ending a day of high political drama in Brazil , the supreme court bought President Dilma Rousseff a little time on Tuesday night to reverse a potentially devastating vote on the impeachment committee that will decide her fate .
In a secret ballot earlier in the day , the lower house of Brazilâ€ ™ s congress appointed a committee stacked with opponents of the embattled Workers party leader , who will be tasked with investigating whether to launch impeachment proceedings .
Scuffles broke out on the floor of the legislature as supporters of the president attempted to physically block the ballot , smashing an electronic voting unit and unplugging others .
The government lost the vote by 272 against 199 , but a few hours later Justice Luiz Edson Fachin of the supreme court suspended the creation of the committee until a judgement is issued on the legality of the secret vote .
Ruling on the challenge filed by the Communist party , the judge said committee members must be selected by party leaders and elected in an open vote .
The injunction will remain in place until next week .
The committee will have the task of reporting on whether Rousseff committed an impeachable offense .
Opponents who filed the impeachment motion that set the process in train accuse her of breaking budget rules to boost spending during her re - election campaign last year .
Rousseff has denied any wrongdoing .
If the committee finds an offence was committed , the process will go to a full vote on the house floor , in which the opposition needs two - thirds of the votes to begin a 180-day impeachment trial in the senate .
During that trial , the president would be suspended and replaced by her vice - president , Michel Temer .
Her supporters in congress plan to appeal to the supreme court against the secret voting procedure adopted by speaker Eduardo Cunha , who allowed the alternative list to be presented ."
2015-12-09,"For 25 years , Brazilâ€ ™ s biggest political party has made and broken governments , patiently profiting from patronage without ever taking an ideological stance or an overt leadership role .
But with the country now in the midst of a political and economic crisis they helped to precipitate , elements in the king - making Brazilian Democratic Movement party are finally pushing their own claim to the throne .
Although nominally part of the ruling coalition , senior members of the PMDB ( the Portuguese acronym by which it is best known ) are peeling away to support an impeachment bid against President Dilma Rousseff .
Rousseff is still favoured to survive , but the odds for impeachment have narrowed in the past week as PMDB support for the government has started to crumble .
On Monday , aviation minister Eliseu Padilha resigned .
Then on Tuesday , vice - president Michel Temer was revealed to have sent what reads like a petulant break - up letter to Rousseff in which he complained of being given only a â€œdecorativeâ€ � role .
â€œI have to get this off my chest , â€ � he wrote in the letter , which was leaked and published by Brazilian newspapers on Tuesday .
â€œI know that you do not trust me and the PMDB today , and I know you wonâ€ ™ t tomorrow .
I am sorry , but this is my conviction.â€ �
Strengthening suspicions that this signalled a shift into the anti - Rousseff camp , Temer â€ “ who would become president if Rousseff were removed â€
“ later told a journalist that he believed there were legal grounds for the impeachment motion .
There are no shortage of reasons why the PMDB might fail to inspire trust in its allies .
Although the party played a prominent role in Brazilâ€ ™ s transition from a military dictatorship in 1985 , it has spent most of the years since aligning itself with any party â€ “ centre - right or centre - left â€ “ capable of securing power .
With no overarching ideology , the party has often resembled a vipers nest of deeply divided factions , ranging from conservative rural landowners and urban social democrats to evangelical nationalists and former guerrillas whose only common ground is a desire to secure the patronage , prestige and â€ “ very often
â€ “ bribes that come with government posts .
Over the past three decades the PMDB has been involved in every major corruption scandal .
Many of its members â€ “ including house speaker Eduardo Cunha and senate president Renan Calheiros â€ “ have been implicated in the Lava Jato investigation into billions of dollars of kickbacks from Petrobras and other major corporations that were used to grease the wheels of politics .
There is particular indignation that Cunha is now pushing for the impeachment of the president in part because he is himself threatened with removal from office â€ “ and subsequent arrest â€ “ for allegedly taking bribes and stashing money into secret Swiss bank accounts .
He denies any wrongdoing .
By contrast the case against Rousseff seems less grave .
She is accused of window - dressing public finances ahead of last yearâ€ ™ s election by using money from state banks .
This was an act of fiscal wrongdoing , though it had a precedent with previous administrations and many legal experts say it is insufficient grounds to remove a presidents .
Rodrigo Motta , a history professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and author of a book on the party , said the PMDB was hoping to use the current crisis to secure the middle ground of Brazilian politics .
But he condemned the morality of Cunhaâ€ ™ s tactics and doubted how much difference a change of leadership would make .
â€œThe irony is that the PMDB is up to its neck in corruption , just like the others , â€ � he said .
â€œIn the midst of a political crisis , it makes no sense to condemn one side and absolve the other , as if this would trigger any change.â€ �
Many in the PMDB realise this , which has worsened splits in the party .
Although Cunha has been openly plotting against the president for months and Temer now appears to be drifting away , the partyâ€ ™ s leader of the house , Leonardo Picciani , and several state governors have lined up to support the government .
Party insiders estimate that Rousseff also has the backing of about 40 to 45 of the 67 PMDB deputies .
In the first big test of parliamentary loyalties on Tuesday , Rousseff lost 272 - 199 in a secret vote on the make - up of an impeachment committee that will decide whether to move forward with her case .
The ballot â€ “ which saw scuffles between lawmakers
â€ “ looked set to be a major setback that left hostile lawmakers from the PMDB and other parties dominating the 65-member committee .
But this was successfully challenged in the supreme court , which said the vote should have been open .
Other battles will follow in what could prove a drawn - out impeachment process .
But whether now or in a few years time , the PMDB and Workers party appear to be on course for a divorce .
After decades in the background , the PMDB decided earlier this year to field its own candidate at the next presidential election in 2018 .
Senior party grandees , including Temer , Cunha , Calheiros and Rio city mayor Eduardo Paes , are already jostling for position .
This has meant the impeachment fight is not just between Rousseff and the opposition , but between PMDB rivals trying to get ahead of one another .
It is a familiar , though unedifying sight for many politicians and observers .
â€œThe internal struggle of the PMDB is sinking Brazil , â€ �
Socialism and Liberty party lawmaker Jean Wylls lamented on his Facebook page ."
2016-02-03,"Brazilâ€ ™ s lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha has won a little breathing room after a parliamentary ethics committee was ordered to reconsider its decision to investigate him for perjury regarding secret Swiss bank accounts .
The ruling by the vice - president of the chamber of deputies , Waldir MaranhÃ£o â€ “ a Cunha ally
â€ “ suggests the shenanigans that paralysed congress last year are likely to continue after a recess for next weekâ€ ™ s Carnival .
Cunha has led the charge to impeach President Dilma Rousseff , an issue that has dominated Brazilian politics even as the country struggles with its worst recession in living memory and an outbreak of the Zika virus , which has been associated with brain damage in babies .
Rousseff is accused of fiscal wrongdoing because she window - dressed government accounts to the tune of 2.5bn reais ( $ 668 m ) .
But her chief accuser , Cunha , is also under investigation by prosecutors who suspect he took about $ 5 m in illegal payments from a kickback scheme at state - owned oil company Petrobras .
In addition , local media have reported that he has at least six bank accounts in Switzerland .
In mid - December , the ethics committee voted 11 - 9 to investigate whether Cunha lied about his Swiss holdings â€ “ a charge that could have resulted in his dismissal as speaker .
Barring any further twists and turns , they will now have to revisit that decision ."
2016-02-03,"Brazil ’s fight against the Zika virus has taken an unorthodox turn in the past week with an invasion of mosquitoes on the official government homepage .
Three insects , seemingly plump with blood , fly back and forth across the portal , which is otherwise filled with dry news about state visits , development statistics and ministerial speeches .
Scroll down and the parasites follow you to a set of pictures , where they appear to buzz around new housing estates and jab their probosces towards the heads of President Dilma Rousseff and her Bolivian counterpart , Evo Morales .
The first reaction of some visitors might be that this must be an attack by hackers outraged at an epidemic that is thought to have infected 1.5 million Brazilians in the past year and is also suspected as a factor in a recent surge of newborns with microcephaly .
But click on one of the insects and it becomes evident that the virtual invasion has been engineered by the governments as part of its public education campaign to halt the spread of the virus .
A red panel opens up , declaring : “ It ’s not enough to kill mosquitoes .
We must n’t let them be born .
This depends on all of us .
Know how to do your part .
# ZikaZero .
”
Follow the hyperlink and it takes you to a page outlining the government ’s efforts to eradicate Zika and two other mosquito - born diseases , dengue and Chikungunya .
It notes that authorities have mobilised 220,000 troops and 300,000 public officials , set up a coordination centre , and embarked on a social awareness campaign .
Other sections include advice for pregnant women and health workers .
There are also morale boosting slogans .
“
A mosquito is not as strong as an entire nation , ” proclaims one .
On Tuesday , Brazil ’s health ministry reported that the total number of confirmed or suspected cases of newborns with abnormally small heads linked to the Zika virus had increased to 4,074 as of 30 Jan , from 3,718 a week earlier ."
2016-02-04,"President Dilma Rousseff has called on all Brazilians to join a â€œmega - operationâ€ � against the Zika virus later this month that will attempt to destroy the breeding grounds of the mosquitos that carry it .
The mass mobilisation on 13 February will involve hundreds of thousands of personnel from the armed forces as well as public officials in a house - to - house campaign to identify and eradicate the stagnant waters where the parasites thrive .
â€œThis is a struggle to protect our families , a struggle that should unite all of us , â€ �
Rousseff told the nation on Wednesday in a televised address that was broadcast on all of the main TV and radio channels .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t admit defeat .
The victory depends on our determination to destroy the breeding grounds.â€ � Her message underscored growing domestic and international concern about a virus that was unknown in Brazil until last April , but is now believed to have infected 1.5 million people there and spread to more than 20 other nations in Latin America .
More worryingly , Rousseff noted that the virus is suspected to have caused a dramatic increases in reported cases of brain defects and microcephaly in newborns .
Alarmed by the trends , the World Health Organisation declared a global public health emergency earlier this week , putting Zika in the same category of urgency as Ebola .
Rousseff said US president Barack Obama had agreed that American scientists would collaborate in an international attempt to develop a vaccine , but until that was achieved , she said , the most effective course of action was to target the insects that transmit the virus .
â€œThe war against the breeding sites is complex because they can be found everywhere
so it needs the engagement of everybody , â€ �
she said , urging people to consider water tanks , flower vases , swimming pools , gutters , bottles , tyres or any container thrown away as rubbish .
â€œWe need continuous vigilance in our homes , our workplaces , our school , and public places , â€ � she said .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s prove once more that Brazil is strong , that we are a conscientious people and that we will not be beaten by mosquitos and the virus they carry.â€ �"
2016-03-13,"More than a million Brazilians have joined anti - government rallies across the country , ramping up the pressure on embattled president Dilma Rousseff .
Already struggling with an impeachment challenge , the worst recession in a century and the biggest corruption scandal in Brazilâ€ ™ s history , the Workers party leader was given another reason to doubt she will complete her four - year term .
The demonstrations on Sunday â€ “ which reached all 26 states and the federal district â€ “ were expected to be bigger than similar rallies last year .
The largest took place in SÃ£o Paulo , where the polling company Datafolha estimated the crowd at 450,000 , more than double the number it registered last year .
Organisers , police and local media calculated far greater numbers .
According to police sources cited by Globo , 3.5 million people took part nationwide in 326 cites , including 100,000 in Brasilia and 70,000 in Curitiba .
The exact figures are contested , but undeniably huge .
In Rio de Janeiro , dense crowds stretched along the beachfront from Copacabana to Leme , and organisers estimated there were as many as a million participants .
Police had yet to provide figures , but it looked likely to exceed 100,000 .
Many protesters wore the canary yellow shirts of the national football team , or draped themselves in the national flag .
Others carried banners expressing anger at bribery scandals and economic woes .
Parents brought children , and some families wore matching â€œimpeachment nowâ€ � T - shirts .
Neighbours travelled on public buses , chanting anti - Rousseff slogans .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s a horror , â€ � said Paulo Rodriguez , a 53-year - old businessman who came with his wife and daughter .
â€œThe Workers party is a horror .
Theyâ€ ™ re a criminal organisation that is robbing state resources .
They are destroying our country.â€ � Rodriguezâ€ ™ s primary frustration was with the economy .
Sales at his crepe business were down 30 % to 40 % compared to last year , he said .
Even though he believed opposition politicians were as crooked as those in government , he felt a change was needed .
â€œIf Dilma goes , the currency will get stronger and confidence will return and people will start spending again , â€ �
he said .
Worryingly for Rousseff , some of the major protests were in former Workers Party strongholds in the north - east .
In Rio , the crowd was predominantly white , middle class and predisposed to supporting the opposition .
Several of the more prominent figures who spoke from sound trucks had rightwing backgrounds .
Among them was Marcelo Itagiba , the cityâ€ ™ s former state security secretary and ex - federal police superintendent , who has been investigated for ties with militias and was one of the inspirations for the gritty film Elite Squad 2 .
Now a congressman with the opposition Brazilian Social Democratic party , he led chants of â€œFora Dilma!â€ � ( â€œDilma Out!â€ � ) from the top of a sound truck , and tried to shout down a critic by labeling him â€œPetistaâ€ � ( a Workers party supporter ) .
But compared to last year , the extreme right was less in evidence in Copacabana .
The crowd also appeared more diverse .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not just the rich .
Everyone is suffering , â€ � said house cleaner Claudia Brasilina , who had travelled almost an hour to get to the protest from her home in the poor suburb of SÃ£o CristovÃ£o .
â€œDilma is ruining the country .
She has to go.â€
�
Like many of the demonstrators , she put her hopes not in the opposition but in the judiciary , particularly judge Sergio Moro , who has presided over the Lava Jato investigation into the kickbacks and bribes associated with Petrobras , the state - run oil company .
That case has spread to involve dozens of other companies and senior politicians from almost all of the major parties .
A popular chant on Sunday was â€œViva
o SÃ
© rgio Moro !
Viva a Lava Jato!â€
�
Rousseff has not been implicated , but several close aides are either in prison or under investigation .
For the protesters , she is tainted by association .
â€œAt the very least , she is guilty of incompetence and arrogance , â€ � read one placard .
â€œDilma
: Institutionalising Corruption 2010 - 2016â€ � said another .
Many others called for her to be impeached .
Congress is debating whether the president should be removed on a separate allegation , of window - dressing government accounts ahead of the election in 2014 .
The legal basis for this challenge is weak , however , and the man leading the charge , speaker Eduardo Cunha , is himself under investigation for bribery .
But the political winds are blowing hard against the president .
The biggest party in her coalition has said it will decide within 30 days whether to quit the government coalition .
Later this week , Rousseff supporters will stage a rally against what they see as a judicial coup , but allies are becoming harder to find .
Several protesters on Sunday said they had previously voted for the Workers Party , which came to power in 2002 with a promise to clean up Brazilian politics .
The economic downturn and corruption scandals have turned many former supporters away .
â€œI voted for Lula , but now I think he is a thief , â€ � said systems analyst Barbara Santos , referring to an ongoing investigation into claims that the former president received illicit benefits from construction companies .
â€œPeople are angry .
Weâ€ ™ ve had it up to here .
Dilma needs to fall so we can have a new government .
Right now all we have is drift .
Itâ€ ™ s hopeless.â€ �"
2016-03-16,"Former Brazilian president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has been named chief of staff in the government of Dilma Rousseff , as the embattled leader reshuffles her cabinet in a desperate attempt to stay in office .
The decision means that the former president , currently under criminal investigation for corruption and money - laundering , will not have to face any eventual trial in an ordinary criminal court .
As a government minister , he will be entitled to the so - called â€œprivileged forumâ€
� of a hearing in Brazilâ€
™ s supreme court .
While the decision will help to shore up support for Rousseffâ€ ™ s flailing government among the trade union movement and others loyal to the former president , it will enrage yet further the anti - government movement that took to the streets on Sunday in the countryâ€ ™ s largest ever protests .
Speaking to the Rio - based O Globo newspaper before the announcement , Carla Zambeli , from AlianÃ§a Nacional , one of the groups behind Sundayâ€ ™ s demonstrations , said : â€œIf Lula takes office , we are going to bring Brazil to a halt.â€ � Lulaâ€ ™ s appointment was confirmed by the presidential palace on Wednesday .
Rumours of the decision had circulated for days , causing a drop in the value of the Brazilian currency , the real , and the stock market , as investors fear his appointment marks a move to the left in terms of economic policy .
The once popular former leader , who left office in 2010 with approval ratings of more than 80 % , has seen his reputation plummet in recent months , as allegations surfaced that he had received benefits - in - kind from construction companies implicated in Brazilâ€ ™ s worst corruption scandal .
He has denied all charges against him .
On 4 March , police briefly detained Lula for â€œcoercive questioningâ€ � over his use of a luxury beachside apartment and a farm in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo state , which prosecutors allege were refurbished and gifted to him , despite being officially registered to others .
The detention of the former president represented the 24th phase of Operation Lava jato ( car wash ) , a two - year inquiry into corruption at Petrobras , the state - run oil company , which has resulted in the convictions of dozens of Brazilâ€ ™ s top business executives .
Almost 50 serving politicians are under investigation .
Brazil is experiencing its worst recession for at least 25 years : its economy shrank 3.8 % last year , and the forecast for 2016 is similar .
Amid these economic woes , Rousseff has been struggling with approval ratings hovering around the single - figures mark for the past six months .
Her government is reliant on a complex coalition of competing political parties , many of which have been implicated in the scandal .
As such , she has found it difficult to pass legislation that would address Brazilâ€ ™ s economic crisis .
In December , the speaker of the lower chamber of congress , Eduardo Cunha , initiated impeachment proceedings against the president , who is accused of illegally using state banks to plug budget shortfalls .
Rousseff also faces being stripped of her mandate in the countryâ€ ™ s top electoral court , after allegations that her 2014 presidential campaign used funds from the Petrobras corruption scheme .
She denies all wrongdoing and has refused to step down .
As news of Lulaâ€ ™ s appointment came through on Wednesday , Valor , a respected economic newspaper , reported that Alexandre Tombini , the president of Brazilâ€ ™ s central bank , was to resign .
He was reportedly unhappy at what the appointment of Lula would mean for the governmentâ€ ™ s economic policies ."
2016-03-17,"Whatâ€ ™ s the story ?
Tens of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets on Wednesday to protest against the government , as a gathering corruption scandal threatened to engulf the president and her predecessor .
Earlier Dilma Rousseff appointed Luiz InÃ¡cio â€œLulaâ€ � da Silva as her chief of staff , in what was widely seen by her critics as an attempt to shield him from prosecution over alleged corruption and money - laundering .
Under Brazilian law , only the supreme court can authorise the investigation , imprisonment and trial of cabinet members .
Hours after Lulaâ€ ™ s appointment , a judge investigating a corruption scandal at the state - run oil company Petrobras released a number of secretly taped phone calls between Lula and Rousseff , which appeared to suggest that the job offer had indeed been made to protect the former president .
The demonstrations are only the latest in a swelling tide of unrest .
On Sunday an estimated 3 million people joined rallies across the country in protest at Rousseffâ€ ™ s beleaguered government , which is also grappling with Brazilâ€ ™ s worst recession in a century .
Who are the key players ?
Rousseff , an economist and former socialist activist who was imprisoned during Brazilâ€ ™ s military dictatorship , was elected as president in 2011 .
She had previously acted as chief of staff to Lula for part of his eight - year presidency , and the two have remained close political allies .
Rousseff has never attained the huge popularity that her predecessor commanded , and has been fighting off potential impeachment proceedings over alleged fiscal mismanagement in office .
The supreme electoral court has been looking into possible campaign funding irregularities that could end up annulling her 2014 re - election .
Lula , as he is universally known in Brazil , is a former union leader who was named the worldâ€ ™ s most popular politician when he left office in 2011 .
But the sprawling Petrobras scandal , in which dozens of prominent politicians have been caught up , threatened to engulf him , too , and this month his home was raided after allegations that he received political favours from companies now under investigation .
The former president accuses prosecutors of launching a politically motivated campaign against him .
What is the Petrobras scandal ?
In a two - year investigation known as Operation Carwash , prosecutors have uncovered what they say is a huge kickback and bribery scheme at the oil giant , which has become the biggest corruption scandal in Brazilâ€ ™ s history .
They allege that senior figures at Petrobras conspired with construction companies to inflate the value of contracts .
Much of the extra revenue was allegedly funnelled to political parties , including Lula and Rousseffâ€ ™ s leftwing Workersâ€ ™ party , to fund election campaigns .
Dozens of politicians and executives have been caught up in the scandal , including Marcelo Odebrecht , a former head of South Americaâ€ ™ s largest construction firm , who this month was jailed for 19 years for bribery and money - laundering in relation to a system of kickbacks that his company allegedly paid to senior Petrobras executives .
Why is it so important ?
Brazilâ€ ™ s economy shrank by 3.7 % last year , and forecasts for 2016 are similarly gloomy .
The uncertain state of its largest oil company and the construction companies caught up in the scandal will not help .
The scandal also offers a further threat to the presidency of Rousseff , who initially avoided being personally touched by the Petrobras allegations despite having been chair of Petrobras from 2003 - 10 , when much of the corruption is alleged to have taken place .
It threatens to shake much of Brazilâ€ ™ s political class ; as well as Rousseff and Lula , Brazilâ€ ™ s vice - president , the speaker of the house , the president of the senate and the main opposition leader have all been accused of involvement ."
2016-03-17,"In the latest of a series of explosive revelations that could bring down the Brazilian government , a secretly recorded phone call between former president Luiz InÃ¡cio â€œLulaâ€ � da Silva and his successor , Dilma Rousseff , suggests his appointment to a ministerial position on Wednesday was motivated by a desire to avoid prosecution in Brazilâ€ ™ s worst - ever corruption scandal .
Judge Sergio Moro , the lead prosecutor in Operation Lava - jato , a two - year investigation into corruption at the state - run oil company , Petrobras , released nearly 50 audio recordings to the media on Wednesday evening , prompting chaotic scenes in congress as opposition deputies demanded Rousseffâ€ ™ s resignation .
On Thursday morning Lula was sworn in as a cabinet minister amid chaotic scenes inside and outside the presidential palace in BrasÃ­lia .
Supporters inside the gallery where the ceremony took place started chanting his name as he walked in , while an opposition congressman who shouted â€œshameâ€ � was quickly bundled out .
In a surprising development , a low - level federal judge in BrasÃ­lia issued an injunction suspending Silvaâ€ ™ s nomination , though government officials expected it to be overturned swiftly by a higher court .
Thousands of protesters congregated outside the presidential palace where government supporters , dressed in the red colours of the ruling Partido dos Trabalhadores , squared off against protesters dressed mainly in the yellow and green strip of the Brazilian football team .
On Wednesday night tens of thousands of Brazilians had gathered in SÃ£o Paulo , BrasÃ­lia , Belo Horizonte and other major cities to demand the presidentâ€ ™ s resignation .
In BrasÃ­lia , riot police fired tear gas and stun grenades at more than 5,000 demonstrators outside the presidential palace and Congress building .
Many waved banners calling for Lulaâ€ ™ s arrest .
Thousands more demonstrators packed the main Avenue Paulista in SÃ£o Paulo .
Earlier in the day , Lula was appointed cabinet chief in a controversial move that Rousseff said would strengthen her government , but which critics argued was an attempt to shield the former president , who is under investigation for corruption and money - laundering , from prosecution .
Under Brazilian law , government ministers can be tried only in the â€œprivileged forumâ€
� of the supreme court .
Opposition activists believe any trial in Brazilâ€ ™ s highest court is likely to progress much more slowly than in the federal court .
They also believe that the supreme court justices â€ “ many of whom were appointed by Lula and Rousseff â€ “ may prove far more sympathetic than Moro .
The judge , from the southern city of Curitiba , has already handed down a number of severe sentences for some of Brazilâ€ ™ s top businessmen who have been found guilty of involvement in the Petrobras scandal .
In the most damaging conversation , recorded on Wednesday afternoon , Rousseff tells Lula that she is sending him over his ministerial papers â€œin case of necessityâ€ � .
The Brazilian media and opposition have interpreted the remarks to mean that she was giving him the papers quickly so that Lula could show them to police to avoid detention .
A note published on the presidential palace website late on Wednesday disputed the oppositionâ€ ™ s interpretation of the call .
It states that Rousseff sent Lula the terms of office for him to sign in case he was unable to attend the swearing - in ceremony , due to take place in BrasÃ­lia at 10 am on Thursday .
It also said that the presidency would be pursuing legal action against Moro .
The former president is accused of receiving benefits - in - kind from construction companies involved in the Petrobras scandal .
Prosecutors allege he is the real owner of two luxury properties registered in the names of others .
Lula denies the charges .
On 4 March , he was briefly detained by police in SÃ£o Paulo and taken in for â€œcoercive questioningâ€ � , along with his wife , Marisa LetÃ­cia , and his eldest son , FÃ¡bio Luiz .
On his release , a highly emotional Lula told supporters he had felt he had been â€œkidnappedâ€ � and questioned why Moro had used such an aggressive tactic when he had repeatedly offered to testify over the case .
That same day he also vented his frustrations to Rousseff , in another phone call that was secretly recorded by investigators and released by Moro to the press on Wednesday evening .
In that recording Lula lambasted Moroâ€ ™ s actions as â€œan unprecedented firework displayâ€ � , after Rousseff noted the coincidence of damaging revelations being leaked to the press the day before his detention .
Lula added that the prosecutors in charge of the case â€œthink that with the press leading the investigative process they are going to re - found the republic .
We have a totally cowardly supreme court , a totally cowardly high court , a totally cowardly parliament â€ ¦ a speaker of the house who is fucked , a president of the senate who is fucked , I donâ€
™ t know how many legislators under threat , and everyone thinking that some kind of miracle is going to happen.â€ �
Notably , however , in that same conversation Lula also said â€œhe would never enter government to protect myselfâ€ � .
Moroâ€ ™ s decision both to record the phone conversations between the former and current president and to release them to the press has come in for severe criticism , even by those appalled by Lulaâ€ ™ s decision to join the government .
The judge justified the decision by stating that the conversations were in the public interest .
â€œDemocracy in a free society requires that the governed know what their governors are doing , even when they try to act in the dark , â€ � he wrote .
Moro also said he believes Lula had advance warning of the raid on 4 March and may have known his phone was tapped .
The latest revelations will intensify yet further the political polarisation in the country .
By midnight on Wednesday there were reports of demonstrations against the government in at least 17 of Brazilâ€ ™ s 26 states ..
In Rio de Janeiro , Adriana Balthazar , from the Vem Pra Rua protest movement , told the newspaper Folha de SÃ£o Paulo that if Rousseff did not resign , there would be further protests .
Other opposition activists want to organise a general strike starting next week .
In tense scenes at Thursdayâ€ ™ s demonstrations a police cordon establishing a 50 metre gap between the two groups broke down , as anti - government activists broke through the police lines to taunt the other side .
â€œI came here for free , â€ � they chanted , referring to the widespread allegation that PT supporters are in the pay of the government .
â€œFascists , fascists , â€ � the government supporters shouted back .
Police on horseback moved in on several occasions to restore order as firecrackers exploded and threats were exchanged .
Photojournalist Karina Zambrana , 26 said she was attending todayâ€ ™ s pro - government protests in defence of democracy .
â€œThis is a very dangerous moment ,
â€ � she said .
â€œThe major media organizations in Brazil are whipping people into a frenzy
so they want war .
We donâ€
™ t want war .
We are here for democracy.â€ �
Civil servant Dimitri Silveira , 33 , said he was not looking for conflict but that protesters were seeking to provoke government supporters .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t want conflict .
We want to defend our democratically - elected president but it seems all of our countryâ€ ™ s institutions - the police , the judiciary - are against us , â€ �
he said .
Anti - government activists , however , have vowed to continue demonstrating until Rousseff leaves office .
â€œ[This government ] are robbing us and they have no shame , â€ �
Gustavo Bertosi , a 23-year old law student said .
Asked whether he thought there was the possibility of conflict between the two sides , he smiled and said yes .
Ernesto Junior , 42 , who described himself as a failed businessman , said â€œI just want what is best for the country .
Itâ€ ™ s not about right or left .
No one can accept what is going on.â€

Last Sunday , millions of Brazilians took part in the largest anti - government protests the country has ever seen .
A pro - government rally is planned for Friday .
On top of the corruption allegations , Brazil is suffering from its worst recession in at least 25 years , with the economy shrinking 3.8 % last year , and the forecast for 2016 similar .
Rousseff is also facing separate impeachment proceedings , accused of illegally using state banks to plug budget deficits .
Another case against her , in the supreme electoral court , claims her presidential campaign in 2014 was financed with cash from the Petrobras scandal .
Last week , Rousseff insisted to the press she had no intention of resigning .
Brazilâ€ ™ s entire political class is now in the firing line .
Opposition politicians who attempted to join Sundayâ€ ™ s anti - government protests were booed and forced to leave .
Alongside Lula and Rousseff , Brazilâ€ ™ s vice - president , speaker of the house , president of the senate and main opposition leader have all been accused of involvement in the Petrobras corruption scandal .

2016-03-17,"Brazil ’s wildly chaotic and increasingly tense political crisis has taken another twist after a judge suspended former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ’s appointment to cabinet moments after he was sworn in .
The decision on Wednesday by president Dilma Rousseff to appoint Lula as her new chief of staff prompted anti - government demonstrations across Brazil , as a secretly recorded phone call between the two suggested his appointment to a ministerial position was motivated by a desire to avoid prosecution in Brazil ’s worst corruption scandal .
Judge Sergio Moro , the lead prosecutor in Operation Lava - jato , a two - year investigation into corruption at Petrobras , a state - run oil company , released nearly 50 audio recordings of police wiretaps to the media on Wednesday evening , prompting chaotic scenes in Congress as opposition deputies demanded Rousseff ’s resignation .
Thousands of Brazilians gathered in São Paulo , Brasília , Belo Horizonte and other major cities on Wednesday night to demand the president ’s resignation .
In Brasília , riot police fired teargas and stun grenades at more than 5,000 demonstrators outside the presidential palace and congress building .
Many waved banners calling for Lula ’s arrest .
Thousands more demonstrators packed the main Avenue Paulista in São Paulo .
On Thursday morning Lula was sworn in as a cabinet minister despite protests both inside and outside the presidential palace .
Supporters in the gallery where the ceremony took place chanted Lula ’s name as he walked in , while an opposition congressman who shouted “ shame ” was quickly bundled out .
Moments later , Itagiba Catta Preta Neto , a judge from a federal court in Brasília granted an injunction against Lula ’s appointment , claiming the move could compromise a police investigation .
But government officials expressed confidence that the ruling would soon be overturned by a higher court , possibly even later the same day .
It subsequently emerged that the judge who authorised the injunction had posted numerous Facebook photos of himself attending anti - government protests .
On Wednesday , Rousseff had justified the decision to appoint Lula as cabinet chief by arguing that his political skills would strengthen her government , but critics say it is an attempt to shield the former president , who is under investigation for corruption and money - laundering , from prosecution .
Under Brazilian law , government ministers can be tried only in the “ privileged forum ” of the supreme court .
Opposition activists believe any trial in Brazil ’s highest court is likely to progress much more slowly than in the federal court .

In São Paulo , Brazil ’s economic capital , about 1,000 people gathered in the city ’s central avenue at lunchtime .
Vanessa Katagueyama , 43 , a tax analyst was taking advantage of her lunch break to protest .
“ Dilma knew everything , ” she said .
“
We want them to fall and then we want new elections .

2016-03-18,"At the end of a week of extraordinary political drama , constitutional chaos and massive anti - government protests , supporters of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and her predecessor , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , will rally in cities across the country on Friday .
The Frente Brasil Popular , a network of trade unions , social movements and other organisations sympathetic to the ruling Partido dos Trabalhadores ( PT ) said it would hold events in 45 cities in defence of democracy and the rights of the working class .
It will mark the first major show of strength by Brazilâ€ ™ s pro - government factions since an estimated 3 million people took to the streets on Sunday to demand the presidentâ€ ™ s resignation .
On Thursday Brazilâ€ ™ s congress elected the 65 members of a special commission that will examine the case to impeach Rousseff , who is accused of using illegal accounting manoeuvres to balance the governmentâ€ ™ s books .
In the evening , as legislators voted for the leaders of the committee , thousands of protesters gathered once more on the huge grassy lawn outside congress chanting â€œresign , resignâ€ � as a cordon of riot police prevented them from approaching the building .
Most political analysts believe the committee itself is fairly evenly split between pro- and anti - Rousseff members , though its president is a close ally of the house speaker , Eduardo Cunha , who initiated the impeachment proceedings .
â€œWhether the committee leans for or against Dilma will depend very much on what happens on the streets , â€ � said Lucas de AragÃ£o , a partner at the political risk and public affairs consultancy
Arko Advice .
â€œThe committeeâ€ ™ s backbone is made up of seven or eight parties which are extremely non - ideological .
These guys have no shame in changing sides.â€ �
One of the committee members who will sit in judgment on Rousseff is Paulo Maluf , recently sentenced in absentia to three yearsâ€ ™ jail for money - laundering by a court in France .
Around 26 % of congress face active criminal proceedings .
After Rousseff presents her defence , the committee will make a recommendation to the congress , but whatever it decides , the vote to impeach will go to the floor as a whole .
If two - thirds approve , it then moves on to the senate , where it requires only a simply majority to pass .
Should that happen , Rousseff will be suspended from the presidency while the supreme court decides her fate .
â€œThe government has lost control over the variables that keep a country running : the politics , the economy , the streets , â€ � AragÃ£o said .
What happens in the streets is likely to be determined by further revelations from Operation Lava - jato , the investigation into Brazilâ€ ™ s worst - ever corruption scandal , centred around the state - run oil company , Petrobras .
Both Lula and Rousseff have been implicated to varying degrees in the investigation or its offshoots , as have senior coalition allies and AÃ © cio Neves , the leader of the main opposition .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s decision to appoint Lula to her cabinet this week prompted widespread outrage among the opposition , which believes the move is designed to shield the former president from prosecution .
The controversial release by the investigative judge of secretly recorded phone calls between the two â€ “ interpreted by the opposition and the Brazilian media as confirmation of this ploy â€ “ only fuelled the fury of anti - government protesters .
In tense scenes outside the presidential palace on Thursday , government supporters and opposition activists were barely kept apart by police as they hurled insults and threats at each other .
Shortly after the ceremony , the anti - government faction rejoiced at news that a federal judge had suspended Lulaâ€ ™ s appointment .
But it subsequently transpired the judge is an opposition activist , and the government appears confident that the supreme court will overrule the injunction .
For Regina Silva , a car saleswoman who attended her first anti - government protest on Thursday night in BrasÃ­lia , the details of the latest developments were overshadowed by her anger at the idea of government ministers becoming rich while the economy nosedived .
â€œThis is the worst government I have ever known .
This is the toughest time I have ever seen .
I see people who used to be in a strong financial situation and now they are practically begging for bread.â€ �"
2016-03-18,"Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians have been demonstrating against the government over claims that the president , Dilma Rousseff , gave her predecessor , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , a cabinet appointment to shield him from prosecution .
As part of Operation Lava Jato ’s investigation into the worst corruption scandal Brazil has faced , Rousseff and Lula have found themselves implicated in an inquiry into the scandal involving the state - run oil company Petrobras , creating constitutional chaos .
Sixty - five members of Brazil ’s congress elected a special commission on Thursday to discuss the case to impeach Rousseff , with supporters of the ruling Workers’ party ( PT ) planning a rally on Friday .
With several social movements and trade unions coming out in support of Rousseff , we asked you how you feel about the corruption claims and what you think the government should do next .
Mariana , São Paulo : ‘ I am protesting because I am tired , and embarrassed by the hypocrisy of Brasilia’
I protest because I am tired .
I am tired of the political scandals .
I am tired of the lies told to the Brazilian people .
I am tired of the political and social class hate that has been ingrained in this country by the very same people who are supposed to unite us .
I am tired of watching Lula and Dilma pretend to be victims when they are the villains .
No , they are not the only villains , but they are villains .
I am tired of watching those in the lower bracket of the social class get their hopes up only to be let down by these politicians who are only interested in growing their power and riches .
I am tired of working hard only to watch these people , who are supposed to lead , destroy our hopes and dreams of a better future for our children .
Brazil has always been a country of the future , and will always remain a country of the future unless we stand up and say ‘ enough is enough’ .
The time has come to put an end to this madness and neither I nor the Brazilian people will stop unless we see change .
Corruption has always existed in Brazil , but over the years that the Partido dos Trabalhadores [ PT ] has been in power , it has grown to an unprecedented amount .
I am neither rightwing nor leftwing .
I want justice .
No one should be defending PT , no one should be defending Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira [ Brazilian Social Democracy party ] and no one should be defending Partido do Movimento Democrático Brasileiro [ Brazilian Democratic Movement party ] .
Leave your ideology to the side .
We should make it our agenda to penalise all the politicians for failing the Brazilian people .
They have robbed us and flashed their riches in our face , through their luxurious trips , nights out and everyday life .
I am protesting because I am tired , and embarrassed by the hypocrisy of Brasilia .
We deserve better .
Our children deserve a better future .
José Costa , Belo Horizonte city : ‘
I want a better country for my four - year - old son’ We are in a deep economic crisis , with high rates of unemployment and we are facing clear corruption from our federal government .
On the face of recent facts , President Dilma and ex - president Lula just made a fool of the population ( and of our justice system along with the federal police ) in an unprecedented manoeuvre .
The situation is unbearable and I want a better country for my four - year - old son .
There are no more resources or possible solutions for this corrupt government .
President Dilma , Vice - President Temer , and now ‘ Minister’ Lula have to step down or quickly be removed ( through impeachment or by responding to the crimes they are being accused of ) .
Robson , São Paulo : ‘ I want the government to obey the constitution and
laws’
I went to Paulista Avenue on Sunday with all my family wearing Brazilian flag coloured T - shirts .
I protested because I want the government to obey the constitution and laws .
The current government is trying to fit corruption into the law to justify this mess that Brazil has found itself in .
Brazilians are aware that there is corruption in parties other than PT .
Our real challenge as citizens is to have zero tolerance against it , and to confront and fight the petty corruption we support as citizens – to avoid it at every level .
We are not communists .
We want progress , development , equal opportunities , jobs , education , government programmes that of course take care of the poorest people but that also leads to self - development and local development to help people make a living on their own .
Maykon Oliveira , Vila Velha , Espírito Santo state :
‘ They are playing dirty with us , our supreme court , on the entire country’ I am protesting for the same reason as everyone else in Brazil : to put an end to this endless and deep corruption institutionalised within our government and political system .
Our representatives – more specifically , our former president and his successor ( and many others , actually ) – are doing anything to maintain their political power , dooming our people , Brazilian citizens that struggle every day to survive .
Foreign investors no longer trust in Brazil , our currency is getting weak over time and our representatives are only thinking of getting away from that .
I do n’t expect anything good from this government .
They do n’t really care .
They are playing dirty with us , our supreme court , with the entire country .
We only demand the resignation of our president and that the corruption within the government be cleaned out .
And starting from the top is the best way to accomplish this task .
Monise , Curitiba , Paraná state : ‘ They are not working for the country but for themselves’ I can not see a better way of fighting against the political , economic and social crisis that we are living through in Brazil other than by protesting .
Nominating someone who is being investigated for corruption even after the big demonstration we had on Saturday [ against Lula and calling for impeachment ] clearly shows us that they are not working for the country , but for themselves .
I am expecting a change in the country ’s leadership for politicians who are not being investigated as well as a better political system .
The country is broken ."
2016-03-20,"Brazilâ€ ™ s president , Dilma Rousseff , is fighting for her political life after a catastrophic seven days that have shaken the country to its core .
After a week that began with the countryâ€ ™ s largest anti - government protests ever seen and ended with its revered former leader , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , blocked from taking up a cabinet post as a result of his alleged involvement in the Petrobras corruption scandal , Rousseff now faces impeachment in Congress that could see her forced out of office next month .
In a move designed to accelerate the hearings against the president , federal deputies sacrificed their usual Friday day off to begin debating Rousseffâ€ ™ s fate .
From now on , extraordinary sessions will be held every Monday and Friday in an attempt to force a vote on impeachment by mid - April .
Lucas de AragÃ£o , a partner at Arko Advice , a political risk consultancy , said the deputiesâ€ ™ decision would be influenced by what was happening on the streets .
â€œMany of these parties are non - ideological , â€ �
he said .
â€œThese guys have no shame in changing sides ; they donâ€
™ t have an ideology to pursue.â€ �
Arko Advice puts the possibility of impeachment at 60 % .
â€œIt is the most likely scenario , but the game is still being played , â€ � he said .
Foreign investors are betting against her .
Brazilâ€ ™ s currency , the real , which fell almost 50 % against the dollar last year as the economy shrank by 3.8 % , started to surge last week as Rousseffâ€ ™
s demise appeared more probable .
On Thursday , the stock market posted its best performance since 2009 .
But after one of the most extraordinary seven days in Brazilian politics , predicting developments over the next few hours , let alone weeks or months , is a foolâ€ ™ s errand .
While Rousseffâ€ ™ s approval ratings are barely above 10 % , the protests against her government continue to be dominated by Brazilâ€ ™ s
white , upper middle - class elite , many of whom are equally as outraged by her leftwing governmentâ€ ™ s economic policies as by allegations of corruption .
Interestingly , however , few opposition politicians were welcomed at the protests , with many , including AÃ © cio Neves , the losing presidential candidate in 2014 , being booed and hounded out of the demonstrations .
If there was any hero for the protesters , it was SÃ
©
rgio Moro , the investigative judge leading Operation Car Wash , a two - year probe into corruption at Petrobras , the state - run oil firm that was once the largest company in Latin America .
Over the course of the investigation , prosecutors have discovered a massive web of corruption in which the executives of Brazilâ€ ™ s top engineering and construction companies colluded with politicians to overcharge on public works contracts at the oil giant .
Dozens of the countryâ€ ™ s top businessmen have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms and almost 50 serving politicians are under investigation .
But while many Brazilians initially welcomed Moroâ€ ™ s fearless work , there is increasing unease at both the methods and targets of his inquiry .
Much of the investigation has been driven by plea bargaining , in which executives and politicians facing serious jail time have implicated others in the hope of a reduced sentence .
Much of this testimony has then been leaked to Brazilâ€ ™ s press , which is overwhelmingly hostile to the ruling Workersâ€ ™ party .
In the latest phase of the operation , prosecutors targeted former president Lula , still a towering figure in Brazilian politics , who hopes to run for the nationâ€ ™ s top office again in 2018 .
Lula is accused of being the real owner of two upmarket properties that have been refurbished by some of the construction companies linked to the Petrobras scandal .
He denies the charges .
On 4 March , police raided his house and detained the former president for four hours of â€œcoercive questioningâ€ � .
News of the detention was leaked in advance to TV Globo , Brazilâ€ ™ s dominant television network , which broadcast rolling coverage of the event .
After his release , a clearly emotional Lula described his ordeal as a â€œkidnappingâ€ � and questioned why such aggressive tactics were considered necessary when he had freely presented himself to the police on previous occasions .
His supporters reacted with outrage , with the leader of the PT in congress , JosÃ © GuimarÃ£es , promising â€œwarâ€ � .
As Rousseffâ€ ™ s government continued to flail last week , with the economy set for another year of 3.5 % contraction and a hostile Congress refusing to pass legislation , rumours surfaced that Lula might be appointed to the cabinet , which would both strengthen Rousseffâ€ ™ s government and shield Lula from prosecution .
In Brazil , cabinet ministers can only be tried in the â€œprivileged forumâ€
� of the supreme court , which can take much longer to get around to hearing cases than lower - level criminal courts .
When news of Lulaâ€ ™ s appointment as Rousseffâ€ ™ s chief of staff was confirmed on Wednesday , opposition activists organised immediate protests and vowed to call a general strike .
At this point Moro decided to pour fuel on the fire by releasing some 50 tapes , secretly recorded by police investigators , of Lula talking unguardedly to a wide variety of political allies .
One , in particular , proved explosive .
The same day as his appointment was announced , Rousseff called Lula to tell him that she was sending him his ministerial papers â€œin case of necessityâ€ � .
The media and the opposition jumped on this ambiguous phrase as proof that the two were colluding to ensure Lula avoided prosecution , sparking further unrest on Wednesday evening and clashes outside the presidential palace where Lula was sworn in on Thursday .
No sooner had the ceremony finished than a court injunction blocked his appointment .
After two days of uncertainty , on Friday night a supreme court minister , Gilmar Mendes , upheld the injunction .
The government will appeal , but it will have to wait until 30 March .
Meanwhile , around 275,000 government supporters , including trade unions and leftwing movements , took to the streets on Friday night in a major show of force for Rousseff and Lula .
Though the numbers were considerably smaller than the anti - government protests the Sunday before , many of them vowed that they would not accept Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment .
Max Marcel , 32 , a teacher from CeilÃ¢ndia , a working - class district on the outskirts of BrasÃ­lia , echoed the sentiments of many .
â€œWe are not going to allow a coup , â€ � he said .
â€œThe people who want impeachment are those sections of the Brazilian elite who were not able to win at the urns and now want to carry out a judicial and media coup.â€ �

2016-03-24,"A defiant Dilma Rousseff has insisted that there is no legal justification for her impeachment and warned that any attempt to remove her from power illegally would leave lasting scars on Brazilian democracy .
In a 90-minute interview with six foreign media organizations in Planalto , the presidential palace , Rousseff stated that â€œpeace would reignâ€ � in Brazil by the start of this yearâ€ ™ s Olympic Games , due to take place in Rio de Janeiro in August .
Thousands of Brazilians later took to the streets in Sao Paulo in support of the embattled president .
They followed huge anti - government protests that have shaken the country in recent weeks as revelations over the countryâ€ ™ s worst - ever corruption scandal add momentum to an impeachment process that began in December .
The presidentâ€ ™ s attempt to appoint her predecessor , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , to cabinet last week
â€ “ in what critics argue is a move to shield him from prosecution â€
“ added to widespread public outrage at politiciansâ€ ™ impunity and prompted calls for Rousseffâ€ ™ s resignation .
â€œWhy do they want me to resign ?
Because I am a weak woman ?
Iâ€ ™ m not
, â€ � she said , arguing that her political rivals wanted her to stand down â€œto avoid the difficulty of removing â€ “ unduly , illegally and criminally â€ “ a legitimately elected president from powerâ€ � .
Pushed as to why it was necessary for Lula to become a minister , rather than serve as an adviser , Rousseff said he had repeatedly turned down her requests to join her government , but now that the crisis had deepened he was doing it as a service for Brazil .
â€œI became his cabinet chief in 2005 in the middle of the mensalÃ£o [ cash - for - votes scandal],â€ � she said .
â€œI know
I helped him then , and I know he can help me now.â€ �
The impeachment process currently in congress accuses Rousseff of using illegal accounting manoeuvres to balance her governmentâ€ ™ s books , but she insists that the legal basis for the accusation is extremely weak .
Rousseff has proved herself a fighter .
As a leftwing guerrilla during the dictatorship era , she was imprisoned and reportedly tortured .
Rousseff noted that every president since the time of GetÃºlio Vargas ( who ruled from 1930 to 1945 ) have had impeachment processes launched against them .
She also noted that the man who initiated the case against her , Eduardo Cunha , the speaker of the lower house of congress , has been charged with corruption .
In the presidentâ€ ™ s opinion , the opposition failed to accept their narrow defeat in the 2014 election and since then have pursued a strategy of â€œthe worse , the betterâ€ � , by sabotaging her legislative agenda and sinking the country .
As for the demonstrations , Rousseff stressed that she was in favour of street protests , because she came from â€œa generation in which if you opened your mouth you could go to jailâ€ � .
But she pointed out that those who have taken to the streets against her government represent less than 2 % of Brazilâ€ ™ s entire population , and criticised the â€œfascist methodsâ€ � used by some of her opponents .
â€œWe have never seen such intolerance in Brazil ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œWe are not an intolerant people.â€
�
The past month has been one of the worst in a spectacularly rough second term for the president , who was re - elected in 2014 in one of the closest campaigns in Brazilâ€ ™ s political history .
Despite a clear mandate , she has had to deal with a hostile congress , an unreliable coalition partner and a corruption investigation that has moved ever closer to the highest level of her Workers Party .
Rousseff believes that any attempt to remove her from power without legal justification would represent a â€œcoupâ€ � .
â€œI am not comparing the coup here to the military coups of the past , but it would be a breaking of the democratic order of Brazil.â€ �
Such a move , she said , â€œwill have consequences .
Maybe not immediately , but it will leave a deep scar on Braziliansâ€ ™ political life.â€ �
For more than a year , there has been a steady drip drip of grim news for Rousseff : the economy is in the midst of its biggest decline in a century , ratings agencies have downgraded Brazilâ€ ™ s sovereign debt to junk status and unemployment is rising .
Meanwhile , the presidentâ€ ™ s popularity has crashed , the finance minister resigned , and the corruption scandal has paralysed Petrobras â€ “ the biggest company in the country â€ “ and led to the jailing of the head of the leading construction firm , Odebrecht .
Personally and politically , however , the biggest crisis for Dilma has been that sparked by a prosecution investigation into alleged wrongdoing by her predecessor and mentor , Da Silva .
The former president â€ “ universally known as Lula â€ “ was detained for questioning and his home and other properties searched earlier this month .
Soon after , Rousseff invited him into her cabinet , thereby taking jurisdiction away from the lower court judges who had approved the warrants for the search and interrogation .
Asked by the Guardian about her decision to appoint Lula , a move that is currently suspended awaiting a final supreme court decision , Rousseff was unrepentant .
â€œLula is not just a talented negotiator , he also understands all of Brazilâ€ ™ s problems , â€ �
she said , insisting that the idea that he has been appointed to avoid scrutiny did not make sense .
â€œA cabinet minister is not immune from investigation , he faces investigation by the supreme court , â€ �
she said .
â€œIs the supreme court
not good enough to investigate Lula?â€
�
Last week , Sergio Moro , the lead judge in Operation Lava - jato , a two - year investigation into corruption at the state - run oil company , Petrobras , released secretly recorded phone calls made by Lula .
They included a conversation with Dilma in which she told him she has an instrument of investiture ready for him
â€œin case it is necessaryâ€
� .
Although ambiguous , this was interpreted by her opponents ( and some supporters ) as proof that the two were colluding to help the former president avoid prosecution .
Calm and seemingly upbeat throughout the interview , the only time Rousseff expressed irritation was when she recalled Moroâ€ ™ s leak of the phone tap .
â€œViolating privacy breaks democracy because it breaks the right of every citizen to a private life , â€ �
she said , banging the table .
Accepting that she had been recorded by accident , Rousseff argued that the correct action for the judge to have done would have been to pass the tape to the supreme court , not the media .
In a veiled criticism of Moro , the president said , â€œa judge must be impartial .
A judge can not rule with political passions.â€ �
Despite having been on the board of Petrobras and a minister of mines and energy , Rousseff has consistently denied knowing anything about the massive corruption scheme that took place at the company .
During the interview she insisted that there was a big difference between a companyâ€ ™ s board of directors and its executives , adding that none of her fellow directors had known about the corruption .
She also pointed out the anti - corruption measures that she had instigated during her government , including the law which allows suspects to offer plea - bargain testimony , a development which has significantly facilitated investigators .
As well as the impeachment process , Rousseff also faces investigation by Brazilâ€ ™ s supreme electoral court over allegations that her 2014 election campaign received financing from the Petrobras scandal .
But the president categorically denied that her campaign benefited from any illegal donations and said she was not worried about the contents of the plea - bargaining testimony of her election guru , JoÃ£o Santana .
The president said that she was sleeping well and insisted that Brazilâ€ ™ s current political crisis was not getting her down .
â€œI think you only get depressed when you feel guilty about something , â€ � she said .
â€œI have never used my powers to favour people whom I shouldnâ€ ™ t have favoured.â€ �"
2016-03-28,"Brazilâ€ ™ s former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has claimed he is the victim of a Big Brother - style investigation that is turning the judicial process into a reality game show .
The Workers Party figurehead â€ “ who earlier this month was briefly detained and questioned over corruption allegations
â€ “ said he and President Dilma Rousseff were fighting an attempted coup by opponents who are using trial by media to try to convict them in the court of public opinion .
The constant attacks , he argued , were an assault on democracy and had made governing Latin Americaâ€ ™ s biggest nation so difficult that the economy was sliding towards â€œparalysisâ€ � .
â€œâ€˜Coupâ€ ™ is the correct term to define what is going on this country , â€ � he said , comparing the current events in Brazil to past moves to unseat the leaders of Paraguay , Honduras and Venezuela .
â€œFor a leader to govern , they can not be preoccupied with day - to - day survival .
Itâ€ ™ s bloodshed every single day .
[ And this is supported by ] a part of the Brazilian media
[ that ] helps to worsen the environment of hatred on the streets of this country.â€ �
Following a similar event by Rousseff last week , Lula was speaking to a group of about 30 foreign media journalists in SÃ£o Paulo .
It appears to be an attempt to circumvent what the ruling party sees as a hostile domestic press at the start of what looks set to be another week of intense pressure on the Workers Party administration .
On Tuesday , the biggest party in Congress â€ “ the Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) â€ “ are expected to vote to leave the coalition , which will weaken Rousseffâ€ ™ s ability to fight off an impeachment push by her opponents .
Later in the week , a supreme court judge will rule on whether Da Silva is allowed to rejoin the cabinet .
Tourism minister Henrique Alves , a member of the Democratic Movement , submitted his resignation late on Monday .
Alves , an ally of vice - president Michel , wrote to Rousseff in a letter : â€œThe dialogue , Iâ€ ™ m afraid to admit , has exhausted.â€ �
The pressure is likely to grow .
The PMDB has reportedly already prepared alternative policies , including welfare cuts , that it would implement in the event of Rousseff being impeached .
Da Silva said it would be sad if the longtime ally left the ruling camp , but he hoped that the government could secure enough support from individual members to sustain a coalition .
Lula , as he is popularly known , was detained and questioned on 4 March in connection with the Lava Jato investigation into a bribery and kickback scandal involving the state - run oil company Petrobras , major construction companies and dozens of politicians .
Prosecutors said they were looking into allegations that the former president had received illegal benefits in the form of construction work done at two properties owned by friends or family .
The judge overseeing the case , Sergio Moro , then authorised the leak of tapped conversations between him and Rousseff that showed the president had prepared a cabinet post for him .
The motives for the appointment were not mentioned , but many interpreted this act as an attempt to give Lula extra legal protection and remove the jurisdiction from Moro because ministers can only be tried at the level of a higher court .
Pressed on why he accepted the chief of staff position so soon after being detained by police , Da Silva said he wanted to push the government away from budget cuts and austerity and towards greater infrastructure spending and measures to improve consumer and business confidence .
He said Rousseff had been trying to persuade him to join her cabinet since last year , but noted wryly that a court invalidated his appointment almost as soon as it was announced .
â€œIt was the shortest term of a chief of staff ever , â€ � he joked bitterly .
Questioned about the leak , the former president suggested judge Moro â€ “ who has become extremely popular for exposing the rampant corruption among the political and business elite â€ “ had become carried away with his celebrity status .
He also insinuated a â€œproduction chainâ€ � between elements of the police , prosecutors and the media .
â€œWe know there are selected leaks of information , but they are only against the PT , â€ �
he said , referring to the Portuguese initials for the Workers Party .
â€œYes , we must fight corruption and investigate who took the money , but is it really necessary to make it a spectacle , to make it a Big Brother show?â€ �
Taking the reality show reference a step further , he dared prosecutors to broadcast his next interrogation live because that would be better , he said , than having only selective parts leaked .
From now on , he promised to produce weekly reports of misinformation in the media .
The combative performance was part political self - defence , part counter - attack and part campaign speech for the next presidential election in 2018 , when Da Silva has indicated he will run .
Far better at communicating than Rousseff , his comments mixed anecdotes and humour .
Lamenting how the atmosphere in Brazil has become poisoned , he said : â€œSociety is very bitter .
Everyone is in a bad mood , irritated , unbearable.â€ �
Asked about the decline of leftwing governments in Latin America , he spoke with nostalgia of the time when he , Venezuelaâ€ ™ s
Hugo ChÃ¡vez and Argentinaâ€ ™ s
Nestor Kirchner were like â€œMessi , Neymar and Suarezâ€ � of FC Barcelona .
Part of the reason for their current malaise , he suggested , was that the United States had been unhappy when Latin American nations created regional organisations without the superpower .
For much of the press conference , he trumpeted the social gains of his time in office and warned passionately of the threat to Brazilâ€ ™ s democracy with a reference to Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy .
Less convincingly , he failed to explain how he and Rousseff had managed over 14 years at the helm without noticing the huge corruption schemes that were funding the election campaigns of all the major parties .
The Workers Party came to power in 2003 promising to clean up the endemic corruption associated with previous administrations .
But since then two huge scandals have shown many senior party figures were sucked into dirty politics .
Revelations of a massive vote - buying scheme in 2005 , known as MensalÃ£o , led to the arrest of several prominent politicians , including Da Silva chief of staff JosÃ © Dirceu .
More recently , the Lava Jato investigation into money laundering and price fixing at Petrobras has exposed how billions of dollars were illegally diverted into campaign slush funds .
Among those arrested or charged in a scandal that has inevitably been nicknamed PetrolÃ£o are former Workers Party treasurer JoÃ£o Vaccari Neto , and the PSDB leaders of the upper and lower houses of Congress .
Lula said the Workers Party deserved credit for paving the ground for the investigation to go ahead by boosting the resources of the federal police , allowing prosecutors to choose the attorney general and enacting anti - corruption and freedom of information laws .
One day , he said , historians would recognise that he , Rousseff and the Workers Party had â€œlifted up the carpet and shown what was underneathâ€ � .
He acknowledged the party had disappointed many of its supporters by breaking an election pledge not to impose austerity measures .
â€œPeople feel betrayed , â€ � he admitted .
If judges allowed him into the cabinet , he promised to work to repair this damage , rebuild trust and tackle the division that plague Brazil .
With Brazil in so much flux , it is unclear whether Da Silva will end the week in the cabinet or jail , as it is uncertain how far Congress will push the impeachment campaign against Rousseff .
â€œPeople should count to 10 because after a wrong decision things could get worse in this country , â€ � the former president said .
â€œThe last thing Brazil needs is more confusion.â€ �"
2016-03-29,"President Dilma Rousseffâ€ ™ s hopes of seeing out her term of office have received a potentially fatal blow after the biggest party in the Brazilian congress voted to abandon her ruling coalition .
The vote by the Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( or PMDB ) could trigger a defection from Rousseffâ€ ™ s coalition by other smaller parties , and greatly increase the prospect that she will lose an impeachment vote in the lower house next month and be suspended from office .
To cries of â€œWorkers party out!â€ � and â€œOnward Brazil!â€ � , PMDB leaders announced their decision to break up the coalition .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to try to change the country .
The economic and social crisis is very serious ,
â€ �
senator Romero Juca , the PMDBâ€ ™ s first vice - president , told a party meeting in the capital Brasilia .
Rousseff now leads a fragile minority government .
Senior officials in the governing Workers party insist the president can still be saved from what they say is a coup attempt against an elected leader who still has more than half of her four - year mandate to serve .
Their hopes depend on securing support from individual members of the PMDB , which is a far from united party .
Three PMDB ministers have indicated they may defy orders to quit the cabinet by 12 April .
But government efforts to shore up support look increasingly desperate after the PMDB â€ “ which has 68 of the 513 seats in the lower house â€ “ decided to leave an alliance that has propped up the government for more than 13 years .
David Fleischer , political science professor at the University of BrasÃ­lia , said the defection would create a domino effect that is likely to topple Rousseff .
â€œThis is her D - Day , â€ � he said .
â€œ[Now the PMDB has left ] the possibility of her impeachment increases to 90%.â€
�
The presidentâ€ ™ s opponents will now have an increased majority on the impeachment committee which could give the go - ahead for a full congressional vote , most likely on 17 April , Fleischer said .
The departure of the PMDB marks a new low in a protracted political crisis triggered by efforts to unseat Rousseff following the Operation Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) revelations of money laundering , price fixing and bribery at the state - run oil company , Petrobras .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s enemies are attempting to launch impeachment proceedings on several grounds , including ongoing investigations into alleged budget irregularities and campaign finance violations .
The president has insisted there is no legal basis for impeachment , telling reporters last week that any attempt to remove her from power without legal justification would represent a â€œcoupâ€ � .
The political trench warfare has paralysed decision making in BrasÃ­lia , worsening an economy that is deep in recession and heightening public anger .
More than a million protesters took to the streets earlier this month in a huge anti - government demonstration .
If 342 of the 513 deputies approve , the impeachment process would move to the senate and Rousseff would be suspended for 180 days while Brazilâ€ ™ s vice - president , Michel Temer â€ “ leader of the PMDB â€ “ would become interim head of state .
A final decision on whether to formally remove her from office would then be taken sometime around October .
Senator Aecio Neves , leader of the opposition Brazilian Social Democracy Party ( or PSDB ) , said he and the leaders of five other opposition parties were ready to back a transitional government led by Temer .
â€œRousseffâ€ ™ s government is finished .
The departure of the PMDB is the last nail in the coffin of a dying government , â€ � said Neves , who narrowly lost to Rousseff in the 2014 election .
Carlos Pereira , a political scientist at the Brazilian School of Administration , concurred that the chances of the presidentâ€ ™ s removal have increased considerably .
â€œThe exit of PMDB will fatally encourage other smaller parties to abandon the coalition , bringing the Dilma government to a state of political isolation , â€ � he said , predicting the vice - president would reap the benefits ahead of the next election in 2018 .
â€œThe potential Temer government would be a sort of government of national salvation in the sense that virtually all the political forces will most likely support him .
It will be a transitional government and so will have a narrow margin for error.â€
�
A party of influence brokers rather than ideologues
, the PMDB has steadily increased its presence in the government even as it has wavered in its support .
Until Monday , it held seven ministerial posts as well as the vice - presidency .
But it has long been divided about its loyalties to the administration .
Since last year , PMDB member and lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha has openly plotted against Rousseff .
In December , he gave the green light to impeachment proceedings based on accusations that the government window - dressed its accounts before the last election .
The party is now pushing to secure power for itself , though it is unlikely to be any less vulnerable to corruption allegations .
Cunha and other senior PMDB figures have been implicated , along with politicians of all stripes , in the Petrobras scandal .
PMDB defections from the ruling camp have increased steadily .
The most recent to go was the tourism minister , Henrique Eduardo Alves , who quit on Monday .
Even before Tuesdayâ€ ™ s vote , domestic newspapers carried leaks of the policy agenda , including welfare cuts , that the PMDB plans to carry out if it takes power .
The consequences and repercussions of such a move could be tumultuous .
Political tensions are already high .
None of the potential replacements for Rousseff have clean hands .
Senior Workers party officials say the impeachment charges are trumped up by opponents who were unable to accept election defeat .
Former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva said the attempt to unseat Rousseff was a coup , similar to those used in recent years against leaders in Paraguay and Honduras .
He warned on Monday that Brazilâ€ ™ s 31-year - old democracy was at risk .
â€œIt seems to me the opposition have tried to make it impossible for her to govern Brazil , â€ �
he said .
â€œThey should allow her to have her time to rule this country .
Let voters be the judges at the end of her term .
If she doesnâ€ ™ t do well , we will respect the decision of electorate.â€ �
If Rousseff is removed , she would not be the first elected Brazilian president to be forced from office .
Fernando Collor de Mello resigned in 1992 in the midst of an impeachment fight
he appeared certain to lose ."
2016-03-30,"After 13 years of Workers party rule in Brazil , there is now a very real prospect of a change of government .
For those hoping for cleaner as well as more stable politics , the question is whether there will also be a shift in the position of the increasingly influential judiciary .
Dilma Rousseffâ€ ™ s ruling coalition was on the verge of collapsing on Tuesday under the weight of the most severe recession in a century , a huge corruption investigation and an impeachment drive against the president .
Now the head of a dwindling minority government , Rousseff â€ “ a former Marxist guerrilla who was imprisoned during the dictatorship â€ “ will not give up without a fight .
But she will have to make a remarkable recovery from her political wounds to survive the coming impeachment battles .
For the vast majority of the Brazilian public , her exit would come as a relief .
A poll published on Wednesday showed Rousseffâ€ ™ s approval ratings continued to linger at the 10 % level .
Despite the early successes of the Workers party in reducing poverty , inequality and unemployment , the government â€ “ like many other leftwing administrations in Latin America â€ “ has struggled to maintain momentum after more than 10 years in power .
Former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva ( more widely known simply as Lula ) recognised the decline on Monday , when he compared the old troika of leftwing leaders â€ “ himself , former Venezuelan president Hugo ChÃ¡vez and Argentinaâ€
™ s NÃ © stor Kirchner â€ “ to the Barcelona football clubâ€
™ s
current frontline of Neymar , SuÃ¡rez and Messi .
As well as nostalgia and self - aggrandisement , his words were also a lament that there is no political parallel today .
The cause of this demise is now the subject of furious debate .
Lula and many in the Workers party feel they are the victims of a â€œcoupâ€ � orchestrated by opponents who were unable to accept defeat in the last election .
They blame congress , the media , the markets and the judiciary for undermining a democratically elected government .
There is some truth in these claims , but the Workers party must also blame themselves .
They have failed to meet rising expectations .
Their early idealism has been corroded by cynicism , openness has given way to defensiveness , and promises of clean politics have been belied by spectacular corruption scandals .
First there was the vote - buying scheme known as MensalÃ£o , which claimed the scalp of Lulaâ€ ™ s chief of staff in 2005 .
Now , there is the even vaster Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into contract - rigging and kickbacks at the state - run Petrobras oil company that was used to channel billions of dollars into political campaigns â€ “ mostly for the ruling parties .
Close to 50 politicians have been charged or jailed , including the former treasurer of the Workers party .
Lula too is under intense scrutiny .
His home and other properties have been raided and he was briefly detained and interrogated by federal police .
He and Rousseff ( who is not accused of any crime ) deny involvement in these bribery networks .
But as heads of party and state , they are , at the very least guilty of gross negligence in allowing them to flourish .
Corruption did not start with the Workers party .
It is how politics has long been done in Brazil .
With so many parties , so many elections and such a vast country , huge sums of money are needed to win elections â€ “ and effectively buy majorities .
A new administration might be more capable and more stable , but it is likely to be at least as tainted as the old .
The Brazilian Democratic Movement Party ( PMDB ) , which abandoned the coalition yesterday , is the biggest party in congress and the base of every government since the reintroduction of democracy in 1985 .
It is not rooted in ideology , only in influence broking .
Any wrongdoing committed by Rousseff has been signed off on by this party .
The turmoil for which the president is blamed was partly caused by elements within this party who made Brazil impossible to govern .
Its leaders â€ “ who are now manoeuvring to seize the presidency and â€œsaveâ€
�
the nation â€ “ are all culpable for the problems of the economy and implicated in corruption scandals .
The most likely successor is Vice - President Michel Temer , a PMDB veteran , who has been the target of at least two bribery investigations .
Another possibility is Eduardo Cunha , the PMDB leader of the lower house , who is accused of taking more than $ 5 m from the Petrobras slush fund .
Underlining the double standards in this ugly political battle , Cunha is now spearheading efforts to remove Rousseff from office for temporarily window - dressing government accounts ahead of the last election .
Passing judgment will be a lower house impeachment commission on which 37 of the 65 members also face corruption charges .
Identifying heroes and villains in this depressingly murky world is a foolâ€ ™ s game .
Nothing is entirely straightforward .
Though deeply enmeshed in scandal , the Workers party strengthened the independence and authority of the institutions that have exposed wrongdoing : judges , prosecutors and federal police .
With considerable regional autonomy , these judicial actors â€ “ particularly those in the unfashionable city of Curitiba who launched the Lava Jato probe â€ “ have taken on powerful politicians of all stripes .
They , more than anyone , have shaken the government .
For a public sick of corruption , they represented hopes that the old culture of impunity was finally over , that democratic institutions were growing stronger , that the division of powers was functioning and justice was being done .
The judges â€ “ particularly Judge SÃ
© rgio
Moro â€ “ have become the new darlings of the nation .
Or so it seemed until this month , when the non - partisan position of the Lava Jato investigation was called into question .
After Moro approved the detention of Lula and leaked federal police wiretaps of Lulaâ€ ™ s conversations with Rousseff , the Workers party felt they were being victimised .
For them , the political impeachment drive and the judicial Lava Jato investigation â€ “ which were supposed to be two different things â€ “ were two fronts in a plot to unseat the government .
The allegations of a conspiracy of judges and opposition are unproven .
But the twin challenges to the adminstration have certainly converged in the public mind and in their combined political impact .
Lava Jato has brought anti - government protesters on to the streets , while the impeachment process has come to serve as a political confidence vote .
It may be ethically and legally dubious , but it has left Rousseff teetering .
If she falls , she will probably be replaced by a PMDB - based administration that will improve Brazilâ€ ™ s economy but make its democracy look more fragile .
Of the four presidents the country has had since the end of the dictatorship era , two will have been removed from office before then end of their elected mandates .
And the role of the judges â€ “ who have played such an influential role over the past year â€ “ will come under scrutiny .
The test will be whether they continue their corruption investigations with as much alacrity into the new administration as they did into the old ."
2016-04-02,"The song of a bygone struggle against dictatorship echoed through Brazilâ€ ™ s cities last week as trade unionists , social activists and musicians rallied against what they see as a â€œcoupâ€ � against president Dilma Rousseff .
Geraldo VandrÃ
© â€ ™ s
1968 melody Pra nÃ£o dizer que nÃ£o falei das Flores ( â€œSo they canâ€
™ t say I didnâ€ ™ t sing about the flowersâ€ � ) harks back to an era of flower power and brutal military rule , but it has been revived in a very modern battle for the political soul of the country .
More than 100,000 demonstrators joined protests in dozens of cities on 31 March , a date chosen to mark the 52nd anniversary of the coup that deposed a democratically elected president and ushered in two decades of military rule .
In Rio de Janeiro , tens of thousands of people packed the Largo da Carioca square in a carnival - esque atmosphere that mixed music and caipirinhas with defiant political rhetoric .
On a stage , a variety of speakers returned again and again to the refrain â€œNÃ£o vai ter golpeâ€ � ( â€œThereâ€ ™ s not going to be a coupâ€ � ) , occasionally adding the line : â€œThereâ€ ™ s going to be fightâ€ � .
It was the most significant show of strength to date for the embattled Rousseff , and indicates that regardless of the momentum currently propelling the impeachment movement , neither her supporters nor their allies on the left will accept her removal quietly .
As well as a protest in its own right , the show of people power was also a rehearsal for what is expected to be bigger turnout on 17 April , when Brazilâ€ ™ s congress is due to began a plenary debate on whether to impeach .
It is not easy to defend an unpopular , impotent leader who has overseen the biggest economic decline in a century , political paralysis and a massive corruption scandal that has implicated many of her allies .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s approval rating was just 10 % in the latest poll .
Far larger anti - government rallies have called for her removal .
But many of those who took to the streets on Thursday said they were defending democracy rather than the president .
Regardless of Rousseffâ€ ™ s faults , they believe she was chosen by the electorate to serve a four - year term that is now threatened by a legally dubious impeachment threat .
Unlike many of the demonstrators , Kimie Shimabukuro , a 32-year - old biologist from SÃ£o Paulo , didnâ€ ™ t wear red â€ “ the colour of the Workersâ€ ™ party â€
“ partly because she was afraid of violence and partly because she is unconvinced that Rousseff and her party are worth supporting .
She turned out because of her principles .
â€œIâ€ ™ m against the coup .
I think the impeachment will worsen the corruption situation in Brazil , â€ �
she says .
Her friend , Ushi Arakaki , another Japanese - Brazilian , went further .
â€œI hoped for more from the Workersâ€ ™ party .
But even so , I am opposed to the opportunism of the opposition , which wants to get rid of a president who was elected by popular vote without a legal basis for impeachment .
Thatâ€ ™ s why I consider this a coup.â€ �
â€œThis is a critical moment , â€ � Marcela Abrantes , a 43-year - old teacher , said .
â€œThere is no proof that Dilma did anything to deserve impeachment .
These are just manoeuvres being carried out by congress and the judiciary.â€ �
Technically , Rousseff faces impeachment for breaking Brazilâ€ ™ s law of fiscal responsibility by using funds from state - backed banks to temporarily mask the governmentâ€ ™ s budget deficit ahead of the 2014 election .
Although this practice was used by previous administrations , the presidentâ€ ™ s critics , led by the House Speaker , Eduardo Cunha , say the window - dressing of government accounts is grounds for impeachment .
This has infuriated many voters , not least because Cunha is himself accused of the greater crime of taking $ 5 m from a kickback scheme at the state - run oil company Petrobras .
But in the absence of a no - confidence vote , many politicians see impeachment â€ “ which is within the scope of the constitution â€ “ as the only way to end a political logjam .
The battle over this issue in congress could easily form the plot of an episode of House of Cards .
In the latest twist last week , the possibility of Rousseff failing to complete her term moved much closer with the defection from her ruling coalition of the Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) .
But her fall is by no means a certainty .
Although the Workersâ€ ™ party has abandoned hope of killing impeachment in committee on 11 April , it is desperately trying to secure the 172 seats needed to stifle the process when it comes to a debate and vote in the 513-member lower chamber , which is expected to run from the 15th to the 17th or 18th of this month .
Before then , the pro- and anti - impeachment camps are said to be offering increasingly lucrative incentives to win over the 90-odd deputies of smaller parties who are likely to decide the outcome .
According to Ricardo Noblat , a political commentator for the Globo TV network , the government is currently offering 1 million reais ( Â£190,000 ) of public works contracts for each vote against impeachment , and 400,000 reais for each abstention .
Whatever the two sides are offering , it is likely to increase the closer the vote comes .
While the impeachment battle and corruption investigation suck up all the political oxygen , the economy continues to choke .
Brazilâ€ ™ s GDP â€ “ by far the biggest of any nation in Latin America â€
“ is suffering its biggest contraction in a century .
In the past six months , all three of the worldâ€ ™ s most influential financial ratings agencies have downgraded Brazilâ€ ™ s sovereign debt to junk status .
The latest piece of grim news was that industrial production fell 11.8 % in the first two months of the year .
Everybody agrees the current situation is untenable , but how to restore stability is the subject of furious debate .
While the opposition put their hopes in impeachment , others want elections , or for Rousseff to soldier on .
The Workersâ€ ™ party warns that removing the president would only make matters worse .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a mistake to think that the coup would happen without a reaction .
Many sectors of society will not accept this and it will bring the country into a process of conflicts , â€ � said Paulo Pimenta , a Workersâ€ ™ party deputy .
The peculiarity of the situation has created some unlikely bedfellows .
On the issue of impeachment , the Landless Workersâ€ ™ Movement is on the same side as its arch - enemy , agriculture minister KÃ¡tia Abreu â€ “ one of several PMDB cabinet members who have defied their partyâ€ ™ s orders to leave the ruling coalition .
â€œImpeachment exists in the constitution and by itself is not a coup , but it can become a coup .
It is a traumatic process that will scar the nation .
We have no right to be imprudent , â€ �
Abreu said in an interview .
Back among the red - clad protesters on Thursday , Andrea Oliveira , a 30-year old student whose T - shirt was covered in â€œDilmaâ€ � stickers , said : â€œI am here because I still believe in this government .
I am black and I am poor and I have had the opportunity to go to university thanks to the policies of this government.â€ �
But while many in the crowd were petistas , as government supporters are known , a significant number said that they had no love for the president .
Abrantes the teacher , who voted for the first Workersâ€ ™ party president , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , but never for Rousseff , said she believed the president would survive the impeachment process .
â€œIf
you look at her history , she has survived much worse than this , â€ �
she said , referring to the three years Rousseff , then the treasurer of a Marxist guerrilla organisation , spent imprisoned during the period of military rule .
Chants of â€œDilma , Dilma , Dilmaâ€ � failed to find much of an echo , while cries calling for the resignation of the vice - president , Michel Temer , who has been angling to succeed her , proved much more popular .
Maria Machedo , 55 , a university lecturer , said she had always supported the Workersâ€ ™ party , or â€œPTâ€ �
( Partido dos Trabalhadores ) as it is known , but was highly critical of the alliances it had made to stay in power .
There are over 30 political parties in Brazilâ€ ™ s congress and until the PTâ€ ™ s major ally , the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party ( PMDB ) , quit this week , there were ten in the governing coalition alone .
â€œPolitical reform is this countryâ€ ™ s most urgent priority , â€ � she said .
â€œAfter food , and peopleâ€ ™ s other most basic necessities , we need political reform.â€ �
Later in the evening , Chico Buarque , a writer and singer who is one of Brazilâ€
™ s most respected artists , took to the stage to a rapturous reception .
â€œPeople who voted for the PT , and people who donâ€ ™ t like the PT , â€ �
he said , â€œit is clear that we are here united in our appreciation of democracy and in our robust defence of democracy.â€ �"
2016-04-03,"As Brazilâ€ ™ s congress moves ever closer to impeaching President Dilma Rousseff , there is anger on the streets and hope in the markets that the countryâ€ ™ s kingmaker may soon seize the throne for himself .
For those desperate for change , Vice - President Michel Temer represents salvation .
Others , more concerned about the countryâ€ ™ s fragile democracy , believe he is the perpetrator of a coup .
Nobody , however , has any doubt that recent events have put him in a powerful position .
Since 2011 , the vice - president has been the fulcrum of an alliance between the Workers party - led government and a congress controlled by his centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement party .
Compared with the colourful firebrands that make the most noise in the Brazilian political world , the 75-year - old constitutional lawyer cuts a quiet and somewhat gothic figure with grey , slicked - back hair , a stately bearing and a young beauty queen of a wife who has her husbandâ€ ™ s name tattooed on her neck .
More than 40 years younger and considerably taller , Marcela Temer often appeared to put her husband in the shade , but the vice - president has moved to centre stage since Tuesday , when his party voted to quit a coalition it has propped up for 13 years .
The partyâ€ ™ s exit has left Rousseff teetering on the edge but instead of riding to the rescue , her deputy appears poised to give her the final push and replace her in the PalÃ¡cio do Planalto .
That , certainly , is the hope of his party .
When it announced plans to leave the coalition this week , members chanted â€œDilma out!â€ � and â€œTemer presidente!â€ � .
The vice - president was more oblique .
â€œI am much sought after , but I am not going to touch this topic .
I wonâ€
™ t discuss the subject of what may or may not happen , â€ � he said on his Twitter feed on Thursday .
But it would come as little surprise if he ditched the president : Temer is the figurehead of a party not known for its fidelity .
The youngest of eight children in a family of Lebanese Christians who migrated to SÃ£o Paulo in the 1920s , Temer studied law and entered congress in 1987 .
A calm and methodical organiser and moderator , he quickly rose to a senior position in a party known for dealmaking rather than ideology .
In the 1990s , the PMDB supported the conservative administration of Fernando Henrique Cardoso .
The following decade , it propped up the Workers party government of Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , then Rousseff .
Now , it has abandoned the left and seems ready to switch back to the right .
In the past year , Temerâ€ ™ s loyalty has been called into question by a series of ambiguous public statements and leaked private letters .
Last August , as Brazilâ€ ™ s economic and political crisis worsened , Temer told reporters :
â€œItâ€ ™ s necessary for someone to have the capacity to reunify everyoneâ€ �
â€ “ an evident criticism of
the presidentâ€ ™ s inability to pull the country together .
Then , in December , just after impeachment proceedings were launched against Rousseff , a critical letter to her from Temer was leaked to the press .
In it , the vice - president complained that he was given only a â€œdecorativeâ€ � role because the president did not trust him .
Last month â€ “ as his party was debating whether to quit the coalition
â€ “ he scripted a new manifesto , the â€œTemer Planâ€ � , that was sharply at odds with his bossâ€ ™ s vision of how to restore stability to Brazil .
Despite the ideological flip - flop , PMDB insiders say they are faithful to sound economic management , which is why they have turned against the Workers party .
Temerâ€ ™ s proposals for fiscal austerity and privatisation have delighted the business sector and the right .
Others simply want stability .
Carlos Pereira , a political scientist in the Brazilian School of Administration , predicts there will be widespread support for a transitional government under the vice - president .
â€œA potential Temer government would be a sort of government of national salvation in the sense that virtually all the political forces would most likely support him , â€ � he said .
Opposition politicians see Temer as a cautious figure who is being forced to act out of character due to the severity of the problem facing Brazil .
â€œHe isnâ€ ™ t a popular leader or a leader of a national dimension .
Heâ€ ™ s well respected , a lawyer , a calm person , experienced and a strong articulator .
But he needs to have a modern mindset and be bold .
He canâ€ ™ t keep doing more of the same thing â€ “ weâ€ ™ re not in this crisis by chance , â€ � said Marcos Pestana of the Brazilian Social Democratic party .
â€œA Temer government will have to rescue confidence levels .
He does not have the legitimacy from the ballots , so he must find legitimacy through his performance.â€
�
Others warn of a backlash if an elected president is unseated on dubious legal grounds before the end of her term .
On Thursday , hundreds of thousands of people took part in anti - impeachment demonstrations in dozens of cities .
Banners warned that a coup was under way .
For most of the past year , the most public plotter against Rousseff has been the house speaker , Eduardo Cunha , who â€ “ despite being a member of the PMDB â€ “ has spearheaded the impeachment drive .
But behind the scenes , many observers believe it is Temer who has orchestrated the demise of his partner in power .
Former minister of national integration Ciro Gomes described the vice - president as â€œthe Captain of the Coupâ€ �
â€ “ a label that Workers party congressmen are increasingly willing to accept .
â€œTemer is revealing what has so far been hidden â€ “ that he is the true architect of the coup .
Itâ€ ™ s a coup in his favour and itâ€ ™
s a coup from within , â€ � said Paulo Pimento , a member of the house of deputies .
â€œIn this historical moment , he saw an opportunity to seize a position that he would never otherwise have had access to because he doesnâ€ ™ t have the necessary charisma or leadership qualities.â€ � Pimento , who spent eight years alongside Temer in congress , said the vice - president was admired for his intellect and knowledge rather than his passion and ideals .
â€œNo one knows where he stands on any issue .
Heâ€ ™ s like a Kinder egg .
People will be surprised when they find out whatâ€ ™ s inside.â€
�
If Temer takes power , Pimento predicted he would do a deal to save Cunha from an ethics committee inquiry .
Although relatively untainted by Brazilian political standards , Temer can hardly claim to be a clean broom .
For two decades , he has sat near the top of a system that is characterised by institutionalised corruption .
He has been investigated for bribery and kickbacks at least twice and was recently described as the â€œgodfatherâ€ � who secured the appointments of key figures in the ongoing Petrobras scandal .
He has denied wrongdoing and never been charged , but as vice - president of the country since 2011 and a former leader of the the biggest party in Congress , he had as much a responsibility for oversight as Rousseff and Lula .
Like them , even if he did not gain personally from corruption , he benefited politically .
Also like them , he failed to prevent the public coffers from being robbed by corporate executives and campaign managers .
Whether a Temer administration would allow the continuation of the Lava Jato investigation into corruption at Petrobras would be a key to its acceptance by the public .
But first , he has to become president , and that is by no means certain .
The Workers party may yet be able to cobble together enough votes to stave off Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment .
Protests on the streets could force congress to reconsider the removal of the incumbent .
Temerâ€ ™ s own party could also splinter â€ “ three of its ministers are already refusing to quit the cabinet .
The vice - president also faces an impeachment threat of his own after a motion to that effect was presented to the supreme court on Friday .
Separately , an electoral court is considering whether to invalidate the last presidential election due to allegations of funding irregularities .
If it finds them valid , both Temer and Rousseff would be removed from office and the election would have to be recontested .
In short , there are numerous possible twists and turns ahead before Brazil finds out who will be its president .
Temer , though , is currently better placed than most .

2016-04-05,"Brazilâ€ ™ s vice - president , Michel Temer , must face impeachment proceedings , a supreme court judge ruled on Tuesday as senior lawmakers called for early elections to stem the countryâ€ ™ s intensifying political crisis .
A congressional committee is debating whether to remove Workers party president Dilma Rousseff from office for breaking fiscal rules before her re - election in 2014 .
The impeachment battle has led to government paralysis and massive street demonstrations for and against what Rousseff and her allies are calling a â€œcoupâ€ � .
Temer â€ “ a senior member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement party
â€ “ is poised to replace the president if she is removed .
But with the latest ruling , he is also at risk of being forced out .
Justice Marco AurÃ
©
lio Mello said the lower house must discuss the vice - presidentâ€ ™ s fate because he is accused of the same charges as Rousseff .
The judgment could yet be appealed , but it appears to be a boost for the beleaguered president ahead of the impeachment vote , which is expected around the middle of the month .
With both sides rallying hundreds of thousands of supporters on to the streets in recent weeks , there are concerns that tensions could lead to violence .
As a possible way out of the crisis , there are growing calls for early elections .
Defeated presidential candidate Marina Silva said the electoral court â€ “ which is discussing a separate allegation of campaign funding violations
â€ “ should nullify the 2014 result and allow the public to choose a new leader .
But this could take more than a year .
Senators have proposed legal amendments that would allow for early polls , though it is far from clear that this would get the approval of a congress that is deeply fragmented and widely tarnished by the ongoing Lava Jato investigation into corruption at the state - run oil company , Petrobras .
Rousseff told reporters on Tuesday that she would only consider an early presidential election if the lower and upper houses of congress were also dissolved .
â€œConvince the house and senate to give up their mandates .
Then , come talk to me , â€ � the president was reported as saying by the Folha newspaper , which recently ran a front - page editorial calling for the resignations of Rousseff and Temer and new elections .
The head of the senate , Renan Calheiros ( who is from the same party as Temer ) said he would â€œlook favourablyâ€ � on the idea of elections
this October â€ “ two years ahead of schedule .
But any new legislative debates would have to be scheduled by the house speaker , Eduardo Cunha , who is pushing hardest for impeachment and has a great deal to lose if he is voted out of office .
Cunha is accused of taking more than $ 5 m in the Petrobras scandal , but his seat in congress gives him immunity from prosecution by lower courts ."
2016-04-08,"Indigenous communities and the Amazon rain forest have joined the growing list of potential victims of Brazilâ€ ™ s huge corruption scandal , according to a senior construction executive who testified that the Belo Monte dam was used to generate 150 m reais ( $ 41.4 m ) in donations to the ruling coalition .
In a plea bargain that adds to the pressure on Brazilâ€ ™ s president , Dilma Rousseff , OtÃ¡vio Marques de Azevedo , the former president of the construction company Andrade Gutierrez , also told investigators that dozens of other projects were used to generate funds for political parties .
The greatest attention , however , is on the controversial hydropower plant that was pushed through by President Rousseff despite years of protests by environmentalists and human rights campaigners who say the dam on the Xingu river would destroy indigenous peoplesâ€ ™ livelihoods and harm one of the worldâ€ ™ s most biodiverse regions .
It is now claimed that as well as being Brazilâ€ ™ s biggest engineering project , the 26 m reais dam has also been one of the main sources of funding for government parties .
The ruling Workers party and its former coalition partner , the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party , were allegedly paid 75 m reais each by three construction companies that initially lost the bid to build Belo Monte but were later added to the consortium , the Folha de SÃ£o Paulo reported on Thursday .
This was 1 % of their share of the contract , according to the paper , which said the money was paid by the three firms â€ “ Andrade Gutierrez , Odebrecht and Camargo CorrÃªa â€ “ during the 2010 , 2012 and 2014 election campaigns .
The details of this scheme were revealed in a plea bargain by Marques de Azevedo .
He is one of dozens of executives and politicians who have been charged in the ongoing Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into corruption at state - run oil company Petrobras and major construction companies .
This is not the first claim that the government benefited illicitly from the Belo Monte project .
Workers party senator DelcÃ­dio do Amaral previously testified that the graft scheme was set up during the government of Rousseffâ€ ™ s predecessor , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva .
He claimed it had channelled 45 m reais from overcharged dam contracts to the two parties for the 2010 and 2014 election campaigns .
The government denies wrongdoing .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s office says donations were made lawfully .
But for conservationists and human rights activists , the allegations explain why Belo Monte went ahead regardless of concerns about its environmental impact and economic viability .
â€œIt further confirms what weâ€ ™ ve suspected since the project was rammed forward , in violation of Brazilâ€ ™ s legislation and constitution , â€ � said Christian Poirier , program director of Amazon Watch .
â€œTodayâ€ ™
s
news sheds further light on the rampant corruption that underpins the construction of Belo Monte .
Aside from its looming ethical implications this scandal also reignites the debate as to whether the mega - dam should ever have been built , while revealing what forces lie behind Brazilâ€ ™ s dam building boom.â€ � Peter Bosshard , interim executive director of International Rivers , said corruption was typical on such big hydro projects in other countries , including YacyretÃ ¡
in Argentina , the Three Gorges in China and the first incarnations of the Bakun and Bujagali dams in Malaysia and Uganda .
â€œThey are built not to address the needs of the poor but to line the pockets of decision - makers and benefit a small clique of politicians , bureaucrats and corporate leaders .
All parties in this scheme must be criminally prosecuted , and the companies that paid the bribes should be barred from receiving further government contracts , â€ � he said .
Greenpeace said the report highlighted the need to halt another planned cascade of dams on the TapajÃ³s river .
â€œAndrade Gutierrez has exposed one of the worst - kept secrets in Brazil , that our infrastructure projects are riddled with corruption , including the major dams in Amazonia , â€ � said Danicley Aguiar , Amazon campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil .
â€œThe first question which needs answering is why the Brazilian government insists on building mega - dams instead of investing in more efficient and less destructive options like solar and wind power , which are capable of answering the Brazilian demand for energy.â€ �"
2016-04-11,"We are extremely concerned about the sustained efforts by sections of Brazilâ€ ™
s rightwing opposition to destabilise â€ “ and ultimately overthrow â€ “ its constitutional and elected government , including through attempting to impeach President Dilma Rousseff .
This campaign has involved demonstrations for â€œregime changeâ€ � through the ousting of the president before the end of her term .
These have even included overt calls for the military to carry out a coup dâ€ ™ Ã © tat .
There is also a crude campaign aimed at discrediting former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , whom Dilma is seeking to appoint as a minister in her government .
The aim here seems to be not only to oust Dilma but also legally bar Lula as a potential presidential candidate in 2018 .
Meanwhile , trade unions and social movements have denounced examples of physical aggression against government supporters .

2016-04-12,"Brazilâ€ ™ s president Dilma Rousseff began a week that could make or break her administration with a bruising defeat in a Congressional impeachment committee .
After a bad - natured and at times chaotic debate , the members on the committee voted 38 to 27 to proceed with a motion to remove the Workersâ€ ™ party leader from office for puffing up government accounts before the 2014 election .
Their decision sets the stage for a full vote of the lower house - most likely this weekend - on whether to approve the countryâ€ ™ s first presidential impeachment .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s supporters â€ “ who claim the impeachment drive represents a coup â€ “ will take consolation from their share of votes on the committee .
If repeated in the plenary , their opponents will fail to secure the two - thirds majority needed for the motion to advance to the Senate .
But much can happen in the next six days in a political tussle that has more plot twists and political drama than than a series of House of Cards .
The latest surprise was a leaked speech by vice president , Michel Temer that appeared to show him preparing to move into the presidentâ€ ™ s palace and establish a government of national unity and salvation .
Temer told reporters the audio message was intended for a politician close to him who had asked if he was prepared to govern in the case that Rousseff were to be impeached .
He said the message was mistakenly sent to the wrong group on text messaging service WhatsApp .
Workersâ€ ™ s Party officials accused him of betraying his running mate .
This raised the already high political temperature in Brasilia , where demonstrators have already begun gathering outside Congress .
Public security officials expect pro- and anti - impeachment rallies to attract hundreds of thousands by the time of the plenary vote .
To prevent violent clashes , thousands of troops will be deployed alongside the police and barricades have been erected on the main esplanade to separate the two sides .
Apart from occasional scuffles , most of the tension has so far been released in Congress and public statements .
Rousseffâ€
™ s
supporters have put up a spirited fight .
Attorney general JosÃ © Eduardo Cardozo , condemned what he called a â€œflawedâ€ � process .
â€œIt is absurd to dismiss a president who has not committed crimes , nor stolen a penny , â€ � he said .
â€œSuch a process without crime or fraud would be a coup.â€ �
But he and other allies were overwhelmed in the televised committee meeting .
AntÃ´nio Imbassahy said his opposition Social Democratic party votes for impeachment â€œbecause it understands that Brazil does not deserve to be governed by a president who has committed crimes of responsibility in a conscious and continuous way , who lied to the Brazilian people , who defrauded the elections , who violated democracy , who destroyed the economyâ€ � , he said .
â€œThe final judgement is ahead .
The votes will be registered in history .
And history does not forgive.â€ �
The committee defeat was expected .
Since the biggest party in Congress â€ “ the Brazil Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) â€
“ declared it would abandon the ruling coalition last month , Rousseff has effectively been leading a minority government .
The president is also on the ropes as a result of economic recession , corruption scandals and plots by the PMDB and other parties to seize power .
But Rousseff , who has more than two years of her mandate left to run , is far from being knocked out .
Her opponents are not assured of the two - thirds of the 513 seats they need in the lower house .
Even if they get this level of support , impeachment will also have to be approved twice by the Senate â€ “ first by a simple majority , then by two - thirds â€
“ before it is finalised .
The government can also challenge the process in the supreme court .
Public opinion is another factor .
Despite her own dismal approval ratings , which hover around the 10 % mark , most of Rousseffâ€ ™
s
rivals are even more despised and are accused of equal or greater wrongdoing .
The impeachment process has been spearheaded by lower house Speaker Eduardo Cunha , a PMDB leader who is accused of taking more than $ 5 m ( Â£3.5 m ) in kickbacks from state - run oil company Petrobras and lying to Congress about secret bank accounts in Switzerland .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s most likely replacement is Temer , also of the PMDB , who also faces impeachment proceedings because he signed off on the same policies as the president .
More than half of the 65-member impeachment committee are also charged with bribery or other crimes .
Compared with these accusations , the penalty for the presidentâ€ ™ s alleged wrongdoing is of questionable proportionality .
Her administration was not the first to temporarily window - dress government finances , but none of her predecessor faced repercussions of this severity .
The Workersâ€ ™ party claims this represents a â€œcoupâ€ � .
This accusation was echoed by former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , musician Chico Buarques and other artists on Monday night at a rally of several thousand anti - impeachment supporters under the Lapa arches in Rio de Janeiro .
Many of those who dislike the ruling party do not use this term , but they are uncomfortable about the threat to democracy posed by the removal of an elected president on such flimsy grounds .
Overall , support for impeachment remains high , but appears to be ebbing .
A Datafolha poll at the weekend , showed 61 % of respondents favoured Rousseffâ€ ™ s removal , down from 68 % in March .
The last president to come so close to impeachment was Fernando Collor de Mello who resigned in 1992 on the eve of his conviction by the Senate ."
2016-04-12,"On the face of it , the long steel wall that has been erected outside the Brazilian congress in recent days appears a perfect symbol for the countryâ€ ™ s divided democracy .
The two - metre - high barrier , which cuts the heart of the capital in half , has been put in place in recent days to separate the massive pro- and anti - impeachment rallies that are expected when lower house lawmakers vote in the coming week on whether to remove President Dilma Rousseff from office .
Public security officials say the temporary structure is necessary to prevent violent conflict between the two sides at a time of rising political passions .
The â€œimpeachment wallâ€ � â€ “ as it has already been nicknamed â€ “ will be manned by police and reinforced by thousands of troops .
Images suggest its geometry is in keeping with the modernist design of BrasÃ­liaâ€ ™ s architects , Oscar Niemeyer and LÃºcio Costa .
At a right angle from the central tower of the congress building , the barrier runs in parallel to the two roads on either side of the Esplanada
dos MinistÃ
© rios , dividing Health and Transport , Energy and Agriculture , Defence and Science .
In the process , it cuts neatly through the centre of the grassy slope in the heart of the capital .
In happier times , this served as the scene of World Cup victory celebrations and new yearâ€ ™ s festivities .
In recent years , it has more prominently served as a venue for protest .
But tempting as it is to see the wall as a fitting monument for the current state of the nation , the divisions in Brazil are neither new , nor fixed , nor by any means perfectly symmetrical .
As the commentator Leonardo Sakamoto has noted , after centuries of colonisation , persecution of indigenous communities , slavery and capitalism , nothing in this country is divided equally .
Not income , not media ownership , not political representation and certainly not opinions about impeachment .
According to the latest polls , 61 % of voters favour the removal of the president .
This is roughly the same proportion of congressional committee members who voted for the impeachment motion by 38 to 27 on Monday night .
Though enough to move the motion forward , this majority is still short of the two - thirds the opposition needs in the full plenary vote , which could come on Sunday .
If the imbalance in support stays as it is , Rousseff will keep her job .
But much can change in the next five days .
Public opinion appears to be in a state of accelerated flux thanks to social networks , fast - moving corruption investigations , and the economic rollercoaster of the past 10 years .
It will be an important factor .
In the past month , both sides have brought hundreds of thousands of supporters on to the streets .
They are likely to do so again at the time of the vote .
Those in favour of impeachment blame Rousseff for fudging government accounts , ruining the economy and failing to halt a vast network of corruption that channelled billions of dollars into campaign coffers and the pockets of politicians and businessmen .
Those opposed to impeachment see the removal of an elected leader on legally dubious grounds as a threat to democracy .
Many call it a â€œcoupâ€ � .
With so much at stake , passions are likely to be high .
This will bring risks of violence â€ “ both by the protesters and the security forces .
There have been scuffles at recent demonstrations but serious trouble has been avoided largely by scheduling rival protests on different days or different places .
That wonâ€
™ t be possible at the time of the vote , which will bring the divided sides together and the conflicts possibly to a head .
The wall may help prevent things getting too messy , but the outcome is unlikely to be neat and tidy .
The best that can be hoped is that it proves cathartic .
But for the moment , it is hard to imagine that Brazil can move on so easily ."
2016-04-15,"Like crowds drawn to a lynching , thousands of Brasilians descended on the nationâ€ ™ s capital on Friday as the countryâ€ ™ s notoriously corrupt lawmakers began an impeachment debate that looks likely to drive President Dilma Rousseff from power .
With hundreds of thousands expected by the final vote on Sunday , some came to prevent what they saw as an injustice against an elected leader and an attack on democracy .
Others to cheer on the removal of an unpopular leader who is accused of manipulating government accounts ahead of the last election .
Almost all hoped to influence a congress in the midst of its most morbidly compelling drama in more than 20 years .
But time is running out .
With Rousseffâ€ ™ s chances shrinking by the day , power is already shifting from the modernist PalÃ¡cio do Planalto ,
the presidentâ€ ™ s
official place of work .
Desperately fighting for survival , the president has less time , energy and authority to hold court , dispense favours and appoint ministers .
Instead congressmen and lobbyists now drive past her office on the way to the two alternative centres of influence : the Jaburu , the office of Vice - President Michel Temer , who will take power if Rousseff is removed ( she accused him of treachery this week ) ; or the Royal Tulip hotel , where the former Workers party president Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva is trying to rally support for his successor .
Long - term observers say the double dealing â€ “ in political posts and public works projects â€ “ is staggering .
â€œThe mark of Brazilian politicians is pragmatism and opportunism , â€ � says Chico Alencar , a longtime lawmaker with the Socialism and Liberty party .
â€œSome go straight from Lula at the Royal Tulip to Temer in Jaburu.â€ � Afonso Florence , the leader of Roussefâ€ ™ s Workers party in the House of Deputies , noted wryly that the car park outside Temerâ€ ™ s office is always full these days , a sign , he says , of the vice - presidentâ€ ™ s duplicity .
â€œDilma believed in him .
[ But ] you never know beforehand that you will be betrayed , â€ � Florence said , juxtaposing this treachery with the fidelity of his party leader , during her youth as a Marxist guerrilla .
â€œDilma was imprisoned and tortured for three years during the dictatorship but she never betrayed her comrades.â€ �
Although defiantly repeating the Workers party line that what they call a â€œcoupâ€ � will be defeated , Florence cuts a somewhat forlorn figure , twiddling his fingers and sighing as he pondered questions about the governmentâ€ ™ s chances of survival .
â€œItâ€ ™ s extremely serious , â€ � he admits .
â€œItâ€ ™ s sad that they use these illegal means.â€
�
The legality of impeachment is debatable .
Rousseff is being impeached for window - dressing government accounts ahead of the last election with a temporary transfer of money from state banks .
Similar misdeeds â€ “ albeit on a smaller scale
â€ “ went unpunished during previous governments .
But in the absence of a no - confidence vote in the Brazilian constitution , impeachment is now being used as a pretext for the removal of a president whose approval ratings have plunged to 10 % amid the worst economic downturn for decades and revelations of systematic corruption .
The spectacle is certainly grotesque .
Of the 513 deputies who will pass judgment on Rousseffâ€ ™ s alleged wrongdoing on Sunday
, 53 have been charged with crimes and another 100 or so are under investigation .
The impeachment campaign is being led by the House speaker , Eduardo Cunha , who is accused of taking more than $ 5 m in kickbacks and lying to congress about secret bank accounts in Switzerland .
The likely beneficiary is Temer , who has brazenly plotted against his running mate to the point of â€œaccidentallyâ€ � leaking a recorded rehearsal of the speech he plans to make if he assumes power .
Lawmakers increasingly assume that this will be the case .
Over the past week , the chances of Rousseffâ€ ™ s survival have diminished rapidly with a daily drip of defections from the ruling camp of former allies , including the Progressive party which has 47 lower house seats .
â€œOnce these mid - sized parties moved towards impeachment ,
that was the final nail in Dilmaâ€ ™ s
coffin , â€ � said David Fleischer , professor emeritus at the University of Brasilia .
Such is the deluge , the president is in danger of being buried prematurely .
On Friday , she woke to two of the grimmest pieces of news so far .
The latest vote tallies in the Folha and Estado newspapers show â€ “ for the first time â€ “ that the opposition will secure the two - thirds majority in the lower house that it needs to push the impeachment process to the senate .
The supreme court also showed that it will not ride to her rescue .
It rejected motions to block or change Sundayâ€ ™ s vote .
If Rousseff loses on Sunday , the senate will have 10 sessions to decide whether they should proceed with the impeachment process .
If a simple majority of the 81 senators approves , the president is temporarily removed from office for up to 180 days until a final decision must be made with a two - thirds majority .
Some Workers party lawmakers say privately they are resigned to defeat and are already preparing for the rebuilding that must follow .
In the opposition camp , the mood is ebullient .
Pro -
impeachment lawmakers have started a sweepstake about the margin of victory .
Senator Romario JucÃ ¡ told the Guardian he expects the impeachment camp to win by a margin of almost 40 seats , which would boost the Brazilian currency and stock markets and usher in a period of public spending cuts and sound fiscal management .
â€œSundayâ€ ™ s vote will be remembered in history as the point when Brazil was redirected towards the right track , towards realising its potential growth , â€ � he said .
JucÃ ¡ , a close ally of Temerâ€ ™ s , is the senate leader of the Democratic Movement party , the biggest political force in Brazil .
A party of power - brokers rather than ideologues
, it has allied with left- and rightwing governments to maintain its influence .
Until last month it was part of the ruling coalition , but JucÃ ¡
â€ “ a longtime critic of the alliance â€ “ has been delighted at the speed at which loyalties have shifted .
â€œIt was a stampede of bulls , â€ � he said ,
â€œable to smash through any obstacle.â€ �
Likely to take a prominent position in the new administration , he is also among the lawmakers under investigation by the Lava Jato probe into a vast kickback scheme that channelled billions of dollars from the state oil company Petrobras into campaign coffers of the Workers party and its former allies .
Rousseff , by comparison , has never been accused by prosecutors of a crime .
Asked if it was hypocritical for accused politicians to judge Rousseff on relatively minor charges , JucÃ ¡ replied that unlike her , his case was unproven .
The president , he argued , had to be removed because of the damage she was doing to the countryâ€ ™ s economy , which is mired in recession .
â€œWe looked for a constitutional solution .
Apart from what we did , the only other way was to wait for elections in 2018 .
Brazil
canâ€
™ t wait that long , â€ � he said .
He denied Workers party claims that this was a coup , noting that impeachment followed strict procedures , is supported by a majority of the public ( polls have shown more than 60 % of voters are in favour of removing the president ) , and will lead to a replacement not by a dictator but by the elected second - in - line .
Alencar , the Socialism and Liberal party lawmaker who is opposed to impeachment , agrees this is not a coup , noting how different the current process is from the sudden , violent military takeovers of the past .
But he says it is dubious in many other ways .
He argues that the penalty is disproportionate to Rousseffâ€ ™ s alleged wrongdoing , the curtailment of her mandate diminishes the value of elections and the PMDB â€ “ as the primary coalition partner â€ “ was also responsible for the policies and practices that led to economic recession and systematic corruption .
â€œNothing will change as a result of this , â€ � he says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a lynching.â€ �"
2016-04-16,"Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff fought a last - ditch battle against impeachment on Saturday as her running mate and deputy Michel Temer stepped up his campaign to replace her .
On the eve of Sundayâ€ ™ s vote , newspaper tallies suggested the opposition already has the two thirds majority in the lower house needed to push the president from power on the grounds that she manipulated government accounts ahead of the last election .
But with the numbers still close , and many in the public uneasy about the process , both sides have stepped up a frantic and increasingly tetchy campaign to secure votes in the lower house and support on the streets .
Rousseff went on the offensive on Saturday by claiming Temer and his allies are trying to sabotage the Lava Jato investigation into kickbacks at the state - run Petrobras oil company .
â€œWould those leading the coup allow the fight against corruption to continue?â€ � Rousseff , the Workersâ€ ™ Party president , wrote in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo , noting that the leader of the impeachment drive â€ “ lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha â€ “ is among those accused by prosecutors , while she faces no criminal charges .
â€œThey want to convict an innocent woman and save the corrupt , â€ �
Rousseff noted in the column .
She also claimed the opposition would cut the popular bolsa familia welfare programme if it took power .
Temer took to Twitter to reject allegations that he was guilty of treachery and responsible for political turmoil .
â€œI am defending the unity and peace of Brazilians .
Not chaos .
I hate war , â€ � he wrote in a series of tweets on Saturday .
He also insisted that he would maintain social programmes .
Contrary to Workersâ€ ™ Party claims of a â€œcoupâ€
� , the opposition say impeachment is being carried out according to the constitution and wishes of the public .
Rousseff is extremely unpopular as a result of the deep recession and huge corruption scandal that have jointly dominated headlines since she began her second term at the start of 2014 .
But many people are unhappy about the flimsy grounds for impeachment , particularly compared to the corruption allegations against congressmen .
The presidentâ€ ™ s approval rating is 10 % .
Polls suggest 61 % of voters believe she should be removed .
That is likely , but not yet certain .
The vote will go down to the wire and even if Rousseff loses on Sunday , the impeachment process will progress to the senate .
The upper house most vote within 10 sessions ( most likely by mid - May ) on whether to investigate the president .
If a simple majority approves , the president must step aside for 180 days and Temer will take power until the senate makes a final judgment , which needs a two - thirds majority .
That leaves plenty of time to change public opinion , according to Lindbergh Farias , a Workersâ€ ™ Party senator from Rio de Janeiro .
â€œPeople say that if Dilma steps aside , it will bring stability to the nation , but it will bring instability .
Temer and Cunha are so unpopular that there will be people on the streets within two months of them taking power.â€ �
Other Workersâ€ ™ Party officials say they will push for an early general election if they lose Sundayâ€ ™ s vote .
Both sides plan to rally huge crowds on Sunday , but relatively few people have joined the protests scheduled until now .
On Saturday , former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva â€ “ better known simply as Lula , and who has led the campaign to save the Workersâ€ ™ Party government â€ “ visited a camp of several thousand anti - impeachment demonstrators near the ManÃ © Garrincha football stadium in Brasilia .
â€œThis is a battle for democracy , for respect of the constitution and for a nation of rights , â€ � he told supporters .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t accept in this country to live from coup to coup.â€ �
The temporary base of tents and hammocks is adorned with banners declaring â€œImpeachment without a crime is a coupâ€ �
and â€œThe hope continues : no coup!â€ �
Many of the activists had their transport paid for by unions or social organisations .
Some receive a small daily stipend and subsidised food .
Compared with the predominantly white , middle - class protesters in the pro - impeachment camp , the governmentâ€ ™ s supporters ranged across a far more colourful and diverse set of social and ethnic groups , including LGBT rights campaigners , student unions , landless workers and indigenous communities .
Devalci Costa , a leader of the XakriabÃ ¡
people from Minas Gerais state , was in traditional attire with a feather headdress and war paint .
â€œNothing good could come from this coup , â€ �
he said .
â€œThe Workersâ€ ™ Party has supported indigenous people on land demarcation and recognition of our rights .
The rightwing coup - mongers would take this away and return to the genocidal policies of the past.â€ � Marcio Angelo of the national studentsâ€ ™ union said the pro - government camp expected to rally more than half a million people on Sunday .
â€œPeople realise this is a criminal attack on Dilma .
Our rights are under threat.â€ � A short distance away , pro - impeachment activists have their base in the Parque de Cidade .
They expect millions to come out on to the streets in cities across the country on Sunday in favour of impeachment .
But for the past few days , the camp has been inhabited by only a few dozen people , many of them from the extreme right , some wearing military khaki , almost all bearing the yellow and green Brazilian flag .
Alan dos Santos , a high school philosophy teacher , said his group â€ “ Popular Resistance â€ “ has been trying to bring down the government for many years .
â€œThey have stolen money to spread socialism across Latin America , â€ � he said .
â€œWe arenâ€ ™ t saying : â€˜End corruption and clean up politics.â€ ™
We know corruption is a tool to maintain power.â€
�
For him , the removal of Rousseff would be only the start of a transition to the right , through figures such as Jair Bolsanro â€ “ a congressman who served in the military during the 1964 - 85 dictatorship â€ “ and conservative evangelist pastor Marcio Feliciano .
â€œWe plan to celebrate on Sunday , but that will only be the start of our fight ,
â€ �
Dos Santos said .
Others were more mainstream .
Adilton Brito , a security officer in the government , went with his wife and two sons to a small pro - impeachment rally outside congress on Friday night that was attended by a couple of hundred people .
â€œThis is an important moment .
We have to be here .
We have to change the country , â€ � he said .
â€œThis government has not kept its promises .
They have lost the faith of the people .
Schools donâ€ ™ t work .
Hospitals donâ€ ™ t work and public security has broken down .
â€œOur country is divided by ideology .
The Workersâ€ ™ Party flies the flag of socialism , not the flag of Brazil.â€
�
He admitted any alternative government was also likely to become tainted by corruption .
â€œCunha and Temer will also have to go eventually , but we have to think strategically .
We need a transition.â€ � Another pro - impeachment demonstrator said he had started a hunger strike the previous day and would continue until Rousseff was removed .
The protester , who gave his name as Andreas Lhouglrs , owns a publicity agency in the state of Minas Gerais that he said had been hurt by the policies of the Workersâ€ ™ Party government .
â€œI voted for Lula twice .
I believed in the Workersâ€ ™ Party .
But they have strangled business ,
â€ � he said .
â€œI hope Dilma falls on Sunday .
All the world hopes she falls.â€
�
Fears of violence have so far proved largely unfounded , though there were scuffles on Saturday morning between a small group of rightwing protesters and security guards as former president Da Silva drove up to a hotel .
One demonstrator , Kleber de Borba , showed the scratches and cuts he received in the fracas .
â€œThis is the most corrupt government in the history of the world .
They are a gang of criminals , â€ � he said .
But outside of the small groups of hardcore activists mobilised by both sides , the broader public has so far quietly been watching and waiting ."
2016-04-17,"The Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , faced a day of judgment on Sunday as a hostile and corruption - tainted congress began voting one by one on whether to impeach her and bring nearer an end to 13 years of Workers party rule .
Expected to last at least seven hours , the boisterous political spectacle was broadcast live to the nation , which has turned dramatically against the countryâ€ ™ s first female leader .
Once one of the most popular presidents in the world , Dilma now has approval ratings of just 10 % .
As well as tension about the vote â€ “ which is forecast to go against Rousseff â€ “ there is unease about the reaction on the streets .
Rival political rallies have assembled in a dozen cities to support or oppose impeachment .
Many of those in favour bedecked themselves in the green and yellow of the national flag and chanted â€œFora Dilmaâ€ � ( â€œDilma outâ€ � ) .
Those against were more likely to be dressed in red and yell â€œNÃ£o via ter golpeâ€ � ( â€œDonâ€ ™ t allow the coupâ€ � ) .
Inside a rowdy lower house chamber , deputies crowded to register their votes .
Many of the pro - impeachment camp draped themselves in the national flag and at one point burst into the national anthem .
With each declaration , the mob cheered and booed as if in a pantomime or a football match .
One member even released a confetti cannon , briefly filling the air above him in a glittering cloud of colour .
Presiding over the session was Rousseffâ€ ™ s chief accuser , speaker Eduardo Cunha , who has been the puppet master in this impeachment drama .
He is accused of receiving more than Â£3.5 m in kickbacks from the state - run oil company Petrobras and of lying to congress about Swiss bank accounts .
Last week police raided his home and seized hundreds of documents .
A rare muted moment was when Aliel Machado , of Marina Silvaâ€ ™ s Rede party , declared himself against both sides â€ “ â€œNot Dilma , not Cunhaâ€ � , he said â€ “ before voting against the motion .
Some came out in favour of the impeachment but called for early general elections to get the approval of the electorate .
Advance tallies suggest the opposition will secure the two - thirds majority needed to take the impeachment motion to the upper house .
If they accept , Rousseff will have to step aside and the Workers party government , which has ruled Brazil since 2002 , will be replaced by a centre - right administration led by the vice - president , Michel Temer .
The odds are stacked against the president , who is accused of window - dressing government accounts before the last election .
Rousseff says her opponents are using this minor and common infraction as a pretext for a coup .
Her supporters say her accusers face more serious crimes .
About a third of the lower house deputies are either under investigation or charged with crimes .
On the streets , the crowds were more civil than their elected representatives .
In most places the mood was peaceful , but passions could rise as the result becomes clearer towards nightfall .
Outdoor screens have been erected in several cities so that demonstrators can watch as each of the 513 lower house deputies registers their ballot and makes a short statement .
Outside the congress building in Brasilia , the two sides were divided by a steel barrier .
By mid - afternoon , police estimated the pro - impeachment rally at 18,000 , compared with 7,000 for those opposed .
The anti - government rally was jubilant .
Many expected to be celebrating by the end of the night .
â€œDilma has robbed the people with corruption and inflation .
We must get rid of her , â€ � said Raquel Rosas , a schoolteacher who sat on a Brazilian flag waiting for the result with her 17-month - old daughter .
â€œBut getting rid of her should only be the start .
Temer and Cunha must go too.â€
�
On the other side of the fence , the crowd was smaller and more muted .
Some bore banners saying â€œDefend democracyâ€ � and â€œRespect my voteâ€ � , in reference to tens of millions of ballots cast for Rousseff in the last election that any impeachment would negate .
Fabio Moura , a lawyer from SÃ£o Paulo , said he was disgusted by the opposition because many of them have been implicated in the Lava Jato investigation into alleged corruption at Petrobras .
â€œThey are just trying to impeach Dilma so they can stop the investigation , â€ � he said .
Looking forward , Moura said it would not be so bad for the Workers party .
â€œIt means the opposition will have to make unpopular spending cuts and that will help us in the next election , â€ �
he said .
â€œBut this looks like being a bad day for democracy.â€ �"
2016-04-18,"Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff suffered a crushing defeat on Sunday as a hostile and corruption - tainted congress voted to impeach her .
In a rowdy session of the lower house presided over by the presidentâ€ ™ s nemesis , house speaker Eduardo Cunha , voting ended late on Sunday evening with 367 of the 513 deputies backing impeachment â€ “ comfortably beyond the two - thirds majority of 342 needed to advance the case to the upper house .
As the outcome became clear , Jose GuimarÃ£es , the leader of the Workers party in the lower house , conceded defeat with more than 80 votes still to be counted .
â€œThe fight is now in the courts , the street and the senate , â€ � he said .
As the crucial 342nd vote was cast for impeachment , the chamber erupted into cheers and Eu sou Brasileiro , the football chant that has become the anthem of the anti - government protest .
Opposition cries of â€œcoup , coup , coupâ€ � were drowned out .
In the midst of the raucous scenes the most impassive figure in the chamber was the architect of the political demolition , Cunha .
Watched by tens of millions at home and in the streets , the vote â€ “ which was announced deputy by deputy â€ “ saw the conservative opposition comfortably secure its motion to remove the elected head of state less than halfway through her mandate .
There were seven abstentions and two absences , and 137 deputies voted against the move .
Once the senate agrees to consider the motion , which is likely within weeks , Rousseff will have to step aside for 180 days and the Workers party government , which has ruled Brazil since 2002 , will be at least temporarily replaced by a centre - right administration led by vice - president Michel Temer .
On a dark night , arguably the lowest point was when Jair Bolsonaro , the far - right deputy from Rio de Janeiro , dedicated his yes vote to Carlos Brilhante Ustra , the colonel who headed the Doi - Codi torture unit during the dictatorship era .
Rousseff , a former guerrilla , was among those tortured .
Bolsonaroâ€ ™ s move prompted left - wing deputy Jean Wyllys to spit towards him .
Eduardo Bolsonaro , his son and also a deputy , used his time at the microphone to honour the general responsible for the military coup in 1964 .
Deputies were called one by one to the microphone by the instigator of the impeachment process , Cunha â€ “ an evangelical conservative who is himself accused of perjury and corruption â€ “ and one by one they condemned the president .
Yes , voted Paulo Maluf , who is on Interpolâ€ ™ s red list for conspiracy .
Yes , voted Nilton Capixiba , who is accused of money laundering .
â€œFor the love of God , yes!â€ � declared Silas Camara , who is under investigation for forging documents and misappropriating public funds .
And yes , voted the vast majority of the more than 150 deputies who are implicated in crimes but protected by their status as parliamentarians .
At times the session exposed the farcical side of Brazilâ€ ™ s democracy , such as the Womenâ€ ™ s party that has only male deputies , or the Popular Socialist party that is one of the most right - wing groups in congress .
Brazilâ€ ™ s presidential chief of staff Jaques Wagner said the government was confident the senate would dismiss the impeachment , insisting the vote was a setback for democracy and was â€œorchestratedâ€ � by Rousseffâ€ ™ s opponents who never accepted her re - election victory in 2014 .
But Rousseffâ€ ™ s chances of survival look slim .
Brazil has turned dramatically against the countryâ€ ™ s first female president .
Once one of the most popular leaders in the world , with approval ratings of 92 % , Rousseff has since seen her support plunge as a result of economic recession , political turmoil and the Lava Jato investigation into corruption at Petrobras , which has implicated almost all of the major parties .
Several senior Workers party officials have been arrested in connection with the scandal and former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva is under investigation .
As a former energy minister and head of her party , critics say Rousseff should have known what was going on , but she has not been charged .
Recent polls suggest only 10 % of the public think the president is doing a good job and 60 % support her removal .
But many are uneasy about the dubious grounds for impeachment .
Rousseff is accused of window - dressing government accounts with a temporary transfer of money from state banks ahead of the last election .
Supporters says this minor and common infraction is being used as a pretext for a â€œcoupâ€ � to seize power by a political class that is notorious for far more serious crimes .
About a third of the lower house deputies are either under investigation or charged with crimes .
On Sunday night , Brazilian television channels showed streets full of pro - impeachment protesters dancing in celebration .
Many draped themselves in the national flag and at one point they burst into a chorus of the national anthem .
With each declaration from congress , the crowds cheered and booed as if in a pantomime or a football match .
One even released a confetti cannon , briefly filling the air above him in a glittering cloud of colour .
On the streets , the crowds that had rallied to show support for or against impeachment were more civil than their elected representatives .
Hundreds of thousands took to the streets across more than a dozen cities , the vast majority of them opposed to the government .
Outside the congress building in Brasilia , the two sides were divided by a steel barrier .
The anti - government side was jubilant at the prospect of change .
â€œDilma has robbed the people with corruption and inflation .
We must get rid of her , â€ � said Raquel Rosas , a school teacher who sat on a Brazilian flag waiting for the result with her 17-month old daughter and other families members .
â€œBut getting rid of her should only be the start .

2016-04-18,"Impeachment : step by step
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is fighting for political survival .
The lower house has voted to send the motion to remove her from power to the senate .
But several hurdles lie ahead .
Hereâ€ ™ s how the coming months will unfold .
By mid - May The upper house must decide whether to accept the impeachment motion within ten sessions .
If a simple majority ( 41 of the 81 Senators ) approves , which is likely , Rousseff must step aside for 180 days while the charges against her are investigated in committee .
During this time , she remains in the presidential residence , but her vice president Michel Temer assumes power on an interim basis .
Within 180 days A full plenary of the senate , presided over by the chief justice , will sit in judgment on Rousseff .
If two - thirds approve , which is uncertain , she will be ejected from office and Temer will be president until the next election in 2018 .
Wild Cards
The process can be challenged at any time in the Supreme Court , though so far they have shown little inclination to protect the president .
Temer could also be removed from office as he too faces an impeachment process .
This is unlikely to succeed given his strong support in the lower house , but if it does , Eduardo Cunha , the head of the lower house of congress , would become president .
Some politicians are also calling for early elections if Rousseff is impeached .
This would require new legislation and perhaps a revision of the Constitution , which is problematic .
The Electoral Court is investigating alleged campaign financing violations in the 2014 election .
If they find evidence of wrongdoing , they can invalidate the result , which would mean both Rousseff and Temer would be stripped of their posts and a new election would be called ."
2016-04-18,"Brazilâ€ ™ s embattled
president Dilma Rousseff has said that she will fight to maintain power despite a devastating impeachment defeat in the lower house .
While the opposition camp celebrated Sundayâ€ ™ s vote and prepared for a new administration under Vice - President Michel Temer , Rouseff said that she was the victim of a â€œnon - traditional coup dâ€ ™ etatâ€ � .
â€œI
believe in democracy , â€ � she told reporters .
â€œI will fight , like I have always done in my life.â€ �
She added : â€œThis is not the beginning of the end â€
“ itâ€ ™ s the beginning of the fight.â€ �
Rouseff singled out Temer for criticism , saying that he had â€œopenly conspiredâ€ � against her , and repeated her pledge not to stand down .
â€œMy mandate is not for me ,
itâ€ ™ s for 54 million who voted for me ...
this is a fight for Brazil , for democracy , â€ �
she said .
But despite Roussefâ€ ™ s defiance , the momentum is overwhelmingly with the opposition , who are poised to give Brazil its first centre - right government in more than 13 years .
The house speaker , Eduardo Cunha â€ “ a conservative evangelical who has proved Rousseffâ€ ™ s nemesis â€ “ oversaw the passage of the impeachment motion comfortably with 367 votes , 25 more than the necessary two - thirds majority , prompting opposition politicians , many of them draped in the national flag , to burst into the football chant â€œEu Sou Brasileiroâ€
�
( I am Brazilian ) .
The process now goes to the senate , where only a simple majority is needed to begin deliberations that would force the president to step aside for 180 days until a final verdict is reached .
The government side said supporters should to prepare for the next stage of the impeachment process in the senate .
â€œThe
Workersâ€ ™ party calls on all men and women committed to democracy to remain mobilised and occupy the streets against this fraudulent impeachment , â€ � said Rui FalcÃ£o , the partyâ€ ™ s national president .
Polls suggest more than 60 % of the public favour the removal of Rousseff , who was once one of the worldâ€ ™ s most popular leaders but now suffers approval ratings of just 10 % as a result of a dire economic recession , political tumult and the Lava Jato corruption investigation into kickbacks from the state - owned oil company , Petrobras .
Politicians from almost all of the major parties have been implicated , including several senior members of the Workersâ€ ™ party .
Temerâ€ ™ s supporters in his Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) are already anticipating the change ahead .
Moreira Franco , a senior party member , noted on Twitter that Brazil now had a good opportunity for political and economic reform , but he urged the opposition not to become complacent .
â€œWe need to maintain a national mobilisation so that the senate hears the noise on the streets , â€ � he tweeted .
Many challenges lie ahead .
The vice - president has promised a sound fiscal policy , but this would mean sharp austerity cuts in the midst of an already dire recession .
Many of his supporters â€ “ especially those up for re - election later this year â€ “ will be urging him to maintain public spending .
The bank system , which is staggering under a mountain of non - performing loans , is another major risk that he must handle carefully .
Many of these questions relate to how far to the right Temer is willing to move .
One indication will be whether he appoints Jair Bolsonaro â€ “ a supporter of the former military dictatorship â€
“ to his cabinet .
There is also the constant threat posed to politicians of almost all stripes by the Lava Jato investigation .
Until now , the opposition has used revelations of corruption to tarnish the government .
But many of them are also threatened by accusations of bribery and money laundering .
Many would clearly like Temer to weaken the independence of the prosecutors and federal police , which he could do by appointing a sympathetic justice minister .
But this would be extremely unpopular with the public , who have come to put more faith in the judiciary than their elected representatives .
A key question in this regard will be the fate of Cunha â€ “ who is at the centre of both the Lava Jato probe and the impeachment drive .
His supporters are demanding that Temer kill an ethics committee investigation of the house speaker as a reward for pushing through the impeachment vote .
Given the many problems that Brazil faces , Workers party politicians feel they can regain the initiative with a little time out of office .
Lindberg Farias , a Workersâ€ ™ party senator from Rio de Janeiro , said it will be difficult to block the first vote in the senate , but there is a chance with the second vote , which needs a two - thirds majority and will take place up to six months after the first .
He expects the senate leader , Renan Calheiros , to drag the process on for as long as possible because he is a rival of Temerâ€ ™ s within the PMDB .
The longer it goes on , the more chance he believes the left has of a recovery .
â€œThe public donâ€ ™ t like Temer and Cunha .
I think within two months of their administration , opinion will shift against them and people will move to protect Rousseff , â€ � Farias said .
After last nightâ€ ™ s crushing defeat , this sounds like wishful thinking .
But moods can change quickly .
As Rousseff has learned to her cost , public opinion and political loyalties in Brazil are as solid as quicksand ."
2016-04-18,"When Brazilâ€ ™ s congress voted yesterday to launch impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff , democracy took the form of a farce .
The attempt to remove the democratically elected president â€ “ who won 54 million votes and is not charged with any crimes â€ “ was led by a man accused of corruption and money laundering : Eduardo Cunha , the speaker of the lower house .
On this historic day , Brazilians learned a dangerous lesson about their young democracy : their votes arenâ€ ™ t worth much .
With 367 of the 513 deputies backing impeachment , Rousseff may now be removed from office for delaying fund transfers to state banks so that the governmentâ€ ™ s finances would appear healthier than they are , and for allegedly violating budget laws .
Brazilâ€ ™ s leaders have often resorted to this budgetary trick .
Unlike the president , a good share of those who voted to oust her are under investigation for crimes ranging from corruption to the use of slave labour .
If the senate â€ “ the upper house â€ “ now decides to carry out an impeachment trial , Rousseff will be suspended for a maximum of 180 days and the vice - president â€ “ Michel Temer , known in Brazil as the â€œvice conspiratorâ€
� â€ “ will take over .
If Rousseff is convicted , Temer ( like Cunha , a member of the conservative Democratic Movement party , or PMDB ) will stay .
Temerâ€ ™ s latest betrayal of his former running mate was an inventive wiretap â€ “ of himself .
Assuming Rousseff would be ousted , days before the vote he used WhatsApp to â€œaccidentallyâ€ � send a recording of his proposed victory speech to party cohorts , announcing what his plans would be as president .
To borrow the biblical images so popular in congress , compared to Temer , Judas is a rookie .
If the senate confirms impeachment , the future president will be a politician without votes .
If elections were held today , according to the latest survey by DataFolha , Temer would garner 1 % to 2 % of the votes .
This comedy of errors might seem to suggest that Rousseff and the Workersâ€ ™ party ( PT ) are merely victims .
But that is only a part of the truth .
Rousseff waged the dirtiest presidential campaign since redemocratisation , demonising her adversaries .
Shortly into her second mandate , she reneged on campaign promises , doing the reverse of what she had pledged and bringing losses to workers .
The economic crisis deepened , leaving nearly 10 million Brazilians jobless .
Even PT sympathisers think the president is incompetent .
Frightened by the rising tide of street protests , Rousseff and the PT began raffling off political posts and principles in exchange for support against impeachment .
Holed up in recent weeks in a hotel room in Brasilia , the federal capital , the former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva became the great negotiator .
At the vice - presidential palace , Temer made counter - offers .
Up until the last vote was cast , impeachment was a matter of horse - trading .
Those who were betrayed are also traitors , making the aftermath of the vote much more complicated .
This is why some of those out on the street demonstrating against Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment kept insisting that they were â€œdefending democracy , not the governmentâ€ � .
For some on the left , there has been no defending the government for a long time .
The red - garbed pro - democracy protesters were only in the streets out of respect for the ballot box and because they feel the PT is the â€œlesser of the evilsâ€ � .
On the other side , and in larger numbers , were those dressed in the Brazilian flagâ€ ™ s green and yellow , shouting for impeachment .
After yesterdayâ€ ™ s vote , some factions of the PT began discussing the possibility of calling new elections this year .
Two issues will weigh heavily in deciding Brazilâ€ ™ s immediate future .
One concerns the PTâ€ ™ s legacy and the reshaping of forces on the left .
The other is the fate of Operation Carwash , an investigation by the federal police , public attorney and judiciary into corruption schemes involving the government and major construction companies .
If the president is removed , a significant share of the electorate may embrace the storyline that casts the PT solely as a victim .
This would deepen the hole which the Brazilian left has dug for itself since the PT became corrupted by power , joined forces with longstanding political oligarchies , and betrayed its dearest causes .
If impeachment is framed only as a coup against democracy , the PT may again evade responsibility for its own mistakes , which have been numerous .
It may also put off rethinking its failed ideas about the country and development .
And this will further delay the leftâ€ ™ s construction of a new project for Brazil , incorporating the creative power of the June 2013 protests .
Although the PT is held up as the symbol of corruption in Brazil , it is just one in a crowd .
Over 60 years ago Brazilâ€ ™ s big construction firms built the modernist capital of Brasilia , and never again vacated the centre of political power .
Whistle - blowing by top executives has shown that all the major parties may be implicated in corruption schemes .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment
has been classified as an attempt to sacrifice the PT to save other parties .
In this scenario , Temer , as president , would strip the federal police of funding and autonomy , smothering Operation Carwash in the name of a right - leaning national pact supported by the business class .
This manoeuvre would be swallowed by an exhausted nation , eager for any kind of normality , even if a mirage .
Instead of cleaning up relations between the government and construction firms and bringing about profound political reform , everything would be renegotiated back to where it was .
If this unsettling possibility comes to fruition , instead of peace there will be oblivion .
Brazilâ€ ™ s crisis is not only political and economic , it is also one of identity .
Since the 2013 protests the cliched images that stare back at the country when it looks in the mirror no longer ring true .
When people with differing opinions must be separated by an actual wall to keep them from attacking each other , it spells the death of the stereotype of a cordial and hospitable people who had supposedly overcome racism and inequalities without any confrontations .
Perhaps Brazilians still need to figure out who they are , but they have already begun to understand who they are not .
The contradictions can no longer be stifled .

2016-04-19,"The old wounds and new divisions opened up by Brazilâ€ ™ s impeachment vote were evident on Tuesday when Dilma Rousseff said it was â€œlamentableâ€ � that one of her accusers had glorified the torture used against her and others during the dictatorship era .
The president was referring to Jair Bolsonaro , a rightwing lower house deputy , who dedicated his vote in favour of impeachment to Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ultra , the colonel who headed the feared Doi - Codi torture unit in the 1970s .
Rousseff , a former guerrilla , was imprisoned at the time and tortured .
She rarely goes into details , but once described how she was beaten , given electric shocks and left naked on the floor .
Other women political prisoners from that time have said they were raped .
Bolsonaro â€ “ who is planning to run for president in the next election
â€ “ used his brief statement at the microphone during Sundayâ€ ™ s vote to laud the military leaders who beat and tormented leftwing leaders after the 1964 coup .
â€œThey lost in 1964 , and now they have lost in 2016,â€ � he said .
He then dedicated his vote to â€œthe memory of Col Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra , the dread of Dilma Rousseffâ€ � .
Rousseff was asked to respond to that taunt at a press conference with foreign journalists on Tuesday .
She paused briefly for composure , then replied with dignity : â€œIt is regrettable that this moment in Brazil has opened a door to intolerance , hate and to this kind of statement ,
â€ � she said .
Avoiding any mention of names , she continued : â€œI was arrested in the 1970s and I did , in fact , meet this man he refers to .
He was one of the biggest torturers in Brazil and was accused of torture and killing.â€ �
After losing the vote by a crushing majority , the president is on the verge of losing power .
From next Tuesday , the upper house will decide whether to proceed with impeachment .
If a simple majority of the 81 senators approves in a vote on 17 May , Rousseff must stand aside for 180 days while they debate her fate .
Vice - President Michel Temer , who is set to replace her , has already begun discussions with other senior centre - right politicians who are likely to make up his new cabinet .
Bolsonaro , a former army captain , is the most prominent figure in the â€œbullets , beef and Bibleâ€ � caucus on the extreme right of Brazilian politics .
Revelling in his status as a bete noir of the left , he regularly courts controversy , particularly regarding women .
During a 2014 debate on a Truth Commission report on the murder , rape and torture carried out during the dictatorship , he lashed out a female deputy with the words , â€œI wouldnâ€ ™ t rape you .
Youâ€ ™ re not worth
it.â€
�
These comments prompted the attorney general to press criminal charges but only added to his popularity among conservatives .
In Rio de Janeiro , Bolsonaro won more votes than any other candidate during the last election .
On Facebook , he is the third most â€œlikedâ€ � politician in Brazil .
Part of the reason is Brazilâ€ ™ s culture of machismo , which according to Rousseff has also contributed to the desire for impeachment of the countryâ€ ™ s first female president .
â€œMixed up in all this is a degree of prejudice against women .
There are attitudes towards me that would not exist with a male president , â€ �
she said .
While Rousseff attempts to clear her name , her comments also represent the opening salvo for the 2018 election presidential campaign in which her predecessor Luis InÃ¡cio Lula de Silva is expected to run as the candidate for Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workers party .
The partyâ€ ™ s strategy appears to be to present Rousseff as a wronged woman who is the victim of an injustice , although the party has been deeply implicated in ongoing corruption investigations ."
2016-04-20,"It is worth standing back from the impeachment proceedings in Brazil , and impending regime change , to ask : â€œWhat does this mean for Brazilâ€ ™ s standing in the world?â€ �
Notoriously , Charles de Gaulle is said to have dismissed the country as not serious , but a place for samba , carnival and playboys .
And , until the military dictatorship died in the 1980s and Fernando Henrique Cardoso sorted out the currency and killed inflation in the 1990s , it lacked the conditions to become a world power .
All that has changed now and a great deal is thanks to the Workersâ€ ™ party ( PT ) governments of presidents Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva ( 2003 - 11 ) and the embattled Dilma Rousseff ( 2011 onwards ) .
It was mostly thanks to Lula , who won the presidency at the fourth attempt after ditching overt socialism .
He travelled tirelessly , especially around Africa , to build alliances of developing states and a distinctive independent line .
This was south - south , with strong hints of anti - Americanism .
This paid off .
Brazil was recognised as a key player in the G20 and saw its citizens elected to international posts â€ “
JosÃ © Graziano da Silva become secretary general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation in 2012 ; Roberto Azevedo became director general of the World Trade Organisation in 2013 .
When the New Development Bank was set up in Shanghai for the Brics â€ “ Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa
â€
“
it was designed to challenge the dominance of the World Bank in international development .
Capturing both the World Cup and the Olympics within two years was an achievement which rewarded Lulaâ€ ™ s skill in mobilising sporting bodies , civil society and the media .
The fact that some stadia are white elephants has haunted his successor .
In Latin America itself the PT governments worked to bring together the sub - regional groups which serve the southern cone , and the Andean states .
In 2008 in Brasilia it was agreed to set up the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) , loosely modelled on the EU ; based in Quito this would have 12 ministerial councils , a parliamentary assembly and its own bank .
Like the EU it has had teething troubles .
Outsiders saw a red tide flowing through South America â€ “ of the late Hugo ChÃ¡vez in Venezuela , Evo Morales in Bolivia , the Kirchners in Argentina , Rafael Correa in Ecuador and , of course , Lula in Brazil .
But although each shared a commitment to national sovereignty their politics were far from identical and there could be frictions , as when Morales nationalised oil and gas and put supplies to Brazil at risk .
Lula had warm relations with ChÃ¡vez ; Dilma , while supporting the election of his successor , NicolÃ¡s Maduro , has never had quite the same closeness .
So what will happen now ?
Brazilâ€ ™ s economy is in decline , threatening the PT success in bringing the poor into a â€œnew middle classâ€ � .
The publicity surrounding the Petrobras scandal and the way in which the impeachment has been pressed for by the right could lead cynics to aver that one set of crooks has conspired to throw out another .
Along the way Brazilâ€ ™ s international reputation and capacity for progressive diplomacy have been damaged .
It is not clear that the country will gain respect for a house - cleaning unless all the corrupt politicos are thrown out and , while there are problems about getting rid of an inadequate executive president ahead of term in the many states which have such presidencies , the current example in Brasilia looks partisan .
For the world needs Brazil .
For years the ability of its diplomats , centred in the beautiful Niemeyer building in Brasilia , which has now been witnessing anti - Rousseff demonstrations , has been admired .
Geographically and politically it is the hinge on which its predominantly Spanish - speaking neighbours must turn .
There are issues it can help resolve .
For example , in 2015 Venezuela suddenly claimed to annexe nearly all the maritime waters off Guyana , also threatening the exclusive economic zones of eight other states including Colombia .
It then backed down with Colombia , but ordered its navy to arrest vessels off Guyana , including an Exxon - Mobil survey ship which was looking for oil and gas in recognised Guyanese waters .
Venezuela has revived a claim to two - thirds of Guyana â€ “ territory which neither it nor its Spanish imperial predecessors have ever occupied .
Carl Greenidge , vice - president of Guyana , told a Ramphal Institute audience in London on Monday that this was straightforward bullying .
The original Guyana - Venezuela border was arbitrated at the turn of the 20th century with Brazil as a guarantor of the resulting line .
The last thing Brazil wants is a recurrence of boundary disputes around its periphery , fuelled by greed for oil and minerals , and an active foreign policy can help to calm this controversy .
But with the stasis in Brasilia will the inward - looking deputies and senators remember that Brazil is not an island , but rather part of Latin America ?
It is certainly true that , particularly thanks to Lulaâ€ ™ s energy and flair , Brazilians are now regarded as world citizens .
The fallout from Brasilia will be worldwide ."
2016-04-21,"The story of Brazilâ€ ™ s political crisis , and the rapidly changing global perception of it , begins with its national media .
The countryâ€ ™ s dominant broadcast and print outlets are owned by a tiny handful of Brazilâ€ ™ s richest families , and are steadfastly conservative .
For decades , those media outlets have been used to agitate for the Brazilian rich , ensuring that severe wealth inequality ( and the political inequality that results ) remains firmly in place .
Indeed , most of todayâ€ ™ s largest media outlets â€ “ that appear respectable to outsiders â€ “ supported the 1964 military coup that ushered in two decades of rightwing dictatorship and further enriched the nationâ€ ™ s oligarchs .
This key historical event still casts a shadow over the countryâ€ ™ s identity and politics .
Those corporations â€ “ led by the multiple media arms of the Globo organisation â€ “ heralded that coup as a noble blow against a corrupt , democratically elected liberal government .
Sound familiar ?
For more than a year , those same media outlets have peddled a self - serving narrative : an angry citizenry , driven by fury over government corruption , rising against and demanding the overthrow of Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president , Dilma Rousseff , and her Workersâ€ ™ party ( PT ) .
The world saw endless images of huge crowds of protesters in the streets , always an inspiring sight .
But what most outside Brazil did not see was that the countryâ€ ™ s plutocratic media had spent months inciting those protests ( while pretending merely to â€œcoverâ€ � them ) .
The protesters were not remotely representative of Brazilâ€ ™ s population .
They were , instead , disproportionately white and wealthy : the very same people who have opposed the PT and its anti - poverty programmes for two decades .
Slowly , the outside world has begun to see past the pleasing , two - dimensional caricature manufactured by its domestic press , and to recognise who will be empowered once Rousseff is removed .
It has now become clear that corruption is not the cause of the effort to oust Brazilâ€ ™ s twice - elected president ; rather , corruption is merely the pretext .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s
moderately leftwing party first gained the presidency in 2002 , when her predecessor , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , won a resounding victory .
Due largely to his popularity and charisma , and bolstered by Brazilâ€ ™ s booming economic growth under his presidency , the PT has won four straight presidential elections â€ “ including Rousseffâ€ ™ s 2010 election victory and then , just 18 months ago , her re - election with 54 million votes .
The countryâ€ ™ s elite class and their media organs have failed , over and over , in their efforts to defeat the party at the ballot box .
But plutocrats are not known for gently accepting defeat , nor for playing by the rules .
What they have been unable to achieve democratically , they are now attempting to achieve anti - democratically : by having a bizarre mix of politicians â€ “ evangelical extremists , far - right supporters of a return to military rule , non - ideological backroom operatives
â€ “ simply remove her from office .
Indeed , those leading the campaign for her impeachment and who are in line to take over â€ “ most notably the house speaker Eduardo Cunha â€ “ are far more implicated in scandals of personal corruption than she is .
Cunha was caught last year with millions of dollars in bribes in secret Swiss bank accounts , after having falsely denied to Congress that he had any foreign bank accounts .
Cunha also appears in the Panama Papers , working to stash his ill - gotten millions offshore to avoid detection and tax liability .
It is impossible to convincingly march behind a banner of â€œanti - corruptionâ€ � and â€œdemocracyâ€ � when simultaneously working to install the countryâ€ ™ s most corruption - tainted and widely disliked political figures .
Words can not describe the surreality of watching the vote to send Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment to the Senate , during which one glaringly corrupt member of Congress after the next stood to address Cunha , proclaiming with a straight face that they were voting to remove Rousseff due to their anger over corruption .
As the Guardian reported : â€œYes , voted Paulo Maluf , who is on Interpolâ€ ™ s red list for conspiracy .
Yes , voted Nilton Capixaba , who is accused of money laundering .
â€˜For the love of God , yes!â€ ™ declared Silas Camara , who is under investigation for forging documents and misappropriating public funds.â€ �
But these politicians have overplayed their hand .
Not even Brazilâ€ ™ s
Masters of the Universe can convince the world that Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment is really about combating corruption â€ “ their scheme would empower politicians whose own scandals would be career - ending in any healthy democracy .
A New York Times article last week reported that â€œ60 % of the 594 members of Brazilâ€ ™ s Congressâ€ �
â€ “ the ones voting to impeach Rousseff â€ “ â€œface serious charges like bribery , electoral fraud , illegal deforestation , kidnapping and homicideâ€ � .
By contrast , said the article , Rousseff â€œis something of a rarity among Brazilâ€ ™ s major political figures : she has not been accused of stealing for herselfâ€ � .
Last Sundayâ€ ™ s televised , raucous spectacle in the lower house received global attention because of some repellent ( though revealing ) remarks made by impeachment advocates .
One of them , prominent rightwing congressman Jair Bolsonaro â€ “ widely expected to run for president and who a recent poll shows is the leading candidate among Brazilâ€ ™ s richest â€ “ said he was casting his vote in honour of a human - rights - abusing colonel in Brazilâ€ ™ s military dictatorship who was personally responsible for Rousseffâ€ ™ s torture .
His son , Eduardo , proudly cast his vote in honour of â€œthe military men of â€ ™ 64â€ �
â€ “ the ones who led the coup .
Until now , Brazilians have had their attention exclusively directed towards Rousseff , who is deeply unpopular due to the countryâ€ ™ s severe recession .
Nobody knows how Brazilians , especially the poor and working classes , will react when they see their newly installed president : the pro - business , corruption - tainted nonentity of a vice - president who , polls show , most Brazilians want impeached .
Most volatile of all , many â€ “ including the prosecutors and investigators who have led the corruption probe â€ “ fear that the real plan behind Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment is to put an end to the ongoing investigation , thus protecting corruption , not punishing it .
There is a real risk that once she is impeached , Brazilâ€ ™ s media will no longer be so focused on corruption , public interest will dissipate , and the newly empowered faction in Brasilia will be able to exploit its congressional majorities to cripple that investigation and protect themselves .
Ultimately , Brazilâ€ ™ s elite political and media classes are toying with the mechanics of democracy .
Thatâ€ ™ s a dangerous , unpredictable game to play anywhere , but particularly so in a very young democracy with a recent history of political instability and tyranny , and where millions are furious over their economic deprivation ."
2016-04-21,"After the impeachment vote against Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff , attention is shifting to her accuser - in - chief , who is charged with greater crimes â€ “ but looks more likely to escape justice .
The lower house speaker , Eduardo Cunha , an evangelical conservative and conspiratorial mastermind , started and steered the drive to remove the countryâ€ ™ s first female leader from power as a means of reducing the risks to himself from investigations by a congressional ethics committee and prosecutors for alleged perjury , money laundering and receipt of at least $ 5 m in bribes .
After being condemned on Sunday for fiscal irregularities that had gone unpunished when used by the previous administration , Rousseff turned her fiercest fire on Cunha .
â€œThis process was initiated by a misuse of power , revenge , an explicit revenge ,
â€ �
she told a press conference of foreign journalists on Tuesday .
â€œI feel the victim of a process , a process in which my judges , especially the speaker of the chamber , has a background that does not behove him to be a judge of anything â€ “ it behoves him as a defendant.â€ �
The public appears to agree .
Brazil loathes its politicians , but none more so than Cunha .
A Datafolha survey this month found 77 % of the public wanted him to be stripped of his mandate , compared with 61 - 67 % for Dilma , who is blamed for a dire recession , political turmoil and failing to stop corruption even though she is not accused of any crime .
But the political tide appears to be moving in Cunhaâ€ ™ s favour .
Almost as soon as the vote was over , conservative allies â€ “ many of whom are likely to join a new government next month
â€ “ began lobbying for him to be protected .
The deputy speaker , Waldir MaranhÃ£o , called for the ethics committee investigation into Cunha to be limited .
Many observers say he is now far more likely to remain free and in office by the end of the year than Rousseff or the previous Workers party president , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva .
The situation looked very different in early December , when Cunha appeared to be on the ropes .
Investigators in the vast Lavo Jato ( Car Wash ) corruption inquiry had accused him of taking bribes of at least $ 5 m in relation to Petrobras contracts and laundering money through his church .
Swiss authorities revealed he had secret accounts , which he had denied .
His last hope , it seemed , was to secure a deal with the ruling Workers party to prevent the lower house ethics council stripping him of his mandate and his parliamentary protection from prosecution .
But Rousseffâ€ ™ s aides refused to play ball .
Immediately , Cunha gave the green light to an impeachment request .
It was both retaliation and a bid for survival by a master tactician .
Allies and enemies alike speak in awed terms of the 57-year - oldâ€ ™ s knowledge of congressional procedure and his bloody - mindedness in punishing those who cross him .
Some compare his machiavellian streak to the Mr Burns character in The Simpsons , to whom he bears some resemblance .
More common is a comparison with Frank Underwood in House of Cards , not least because Cunhaâ€ ™ s files on his fellow deputiesâ€ ™ secrets are legendary .
Trained as an economist , Cunha started his political life as a protege of Fernando Collor , the only previous president to have been impeached since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985 .
A convert to the Assembly of God â€ “ one of the countryâ€ ™
s biggest evangelical churches
â€ “ he rose to notoriety as the outspoken host of a radio show on an evangelical station .
With support from the Christian right , he won his first seat in the chamber of deputies in 2003 .
He is now one of three senior figures in the Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) , which has no ideology beyond securing power and brokering influence .
Until last month , it was allied with Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workers party and as deeply implicated in the vast corruption scandal exposed by Lava Jato prosecutors .
Unlike Rousseff , all three of the PMDBâ€ ™ s most powerful politicians have been named in plea bargains related to the investigation .
Vice - President Michel Temer â€ “ who is preparing to take power if the senate forces Rousseff to step aside next month â€ “ has been accused of appointing lobbyists to pay bribes and manipulating appointments at Petrobras so that his allies controlled the flow of campaign donations .
Renan Calheiros , the head of the senate , is being investigated by the supreme court for seven alleged crimes relating to the $ 17bn Petrobras scandal , including bribery and obstruction of justice .
Both deny any wrongdoing .
As does Cunha , who is next in line to the presidency .
But he has become the greatest focus of public anger â€ “ not least due to the profligate lifestyle revealed by the investigation into bribery allegations .
On a nine - day family holiday in Miami at the end of 2013 , the speaker and his family are said to have spent more than $ 40,000 .
This included his wife Claudia Cruzâ€ ™ s shopping splurges on designer goods â€ “ $ 1,595 on Giorgio Armani , $ 3,803 on Salvatore Ferragamo and $ 3,531 on Ermenegildo Zegna â€
“ and restaurant bills that often ran to more than $ 1,000 .
In the two months that followed , there were similar blowouts in Paris , New York and Zurich .
Prosecutors claimed this was completely incompatible with his declared annual income of about $ 120,000 .
They also allege that Cunha and his wife owned a fleet of eight luxury cars , including a Porsche , all of which were registered under the name of Jesus.com and C3 Productions .
But the chances of a conviction are slim .
Last month , Brazilâ€ ™ s supreme court â€ “ the only judicial body that can prosecute sitting politicians â€ “ agreed to accept the charges against Cunha , but it has yet to set a date for a trial .
Precedent suggests it may never do so , though there have been exceptions in recent months .
The ethics council has the authority to strip away the immunity of office , but it appears to have run into a quagmire .
Contrary to the quickfire process of Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment , Cunha has dragged out the process of the ethics council investigation for a record of more than 170 days .
â€œThis started in October of last year and now we are in April , but nothing has happened , â€ � said Osmar Serraglio , a deputy from ParanÃ ¡ from the same PMDB party as Cunha .
â€œItâ€ ™ s shameful for the house.â€ �
During this time the composition of the members has changed in his favour .
In early April , out went one of his chief critics , Fausto Pinato â€ “ who told police he was threatened last November â€ “ and in came an evangelical ally , Tia Eron .
Now the speaker is believed to have a majority in the council .
Allies in the conservative evangelical bloc are calling for an amnesty .
Serraglio rejects the word amnesty â€ “ which has no legal basis in the Brazilian constitution
â€ “
but he said Cunha was unlikely to be punished for lying because the perjury occurred during a previous mandate and
legal precedent suggests people are not obliged to incriminate themselves even if it means lying under oath .
As a result , he said deputies had to find a solution .
â€œNobody is saying there arenâ€ ™ t corruption problems , â€ �
he said .
â€œBut for the lower house of congress not to be humiliated , we need to find a way out.â€ � Any suggestion that Temer might help Cunha evade punishment infuriates their critics .
â€œIf this news is confirmed , it would highlight the absurdity of this entire process , â€ � said Jean Wyllys , a PSOL deputy , who called Cunha a â€œgangsterâ€ � during the impeachment vote .
â€œIt would be a tenebrous deal between two politicians who are rejected by the overwhelming majority of the population .
One , who is accused of corruption , money laundering and other crimes , would have arranged for the other to become a president without a free direct election , and in return he would get an amnesty.â€ �
Analysts expect the domestic media â€ “ which is predominantly supportive of the centre - right â€ “ to gradually dial down their coverage of corruption .
Ana Claudia Farranha , a law professor at the University of BrasÃ­lia , does not expect him to be convicted .
She said : â€œAfter impeachment , attention will shift to Temer , and Cunhaâ€ ™ s actions ... will disappear from the headlines .
He will be forgotten.â€ � Lava Jato prosecutors have vowed to continue their investigation with the same intensity regardless of the government , but their powers could be muted by a new justice minister .
And even if they find more evidence of wrongdoing , Cunha and other politicians will remain at liberty as long as the supreme court and the ethics committee leave cases pending .
That could yet change , but for the moment , it looks as if the millions who took to the streets to unseat Rousseff in the name of anti - corruption may soon find themselves wondering whether they helped a politician who was even more despised off the hook .

2016-04-23,"The Brazilian president , Dilma Rousseff , has told journalists in New York there is â€œno legal foundationâ€ � for her impeachment as she took her fight for political survival into the international ring .
After losing a lower house vote that puts her just weeks away from being ejected from office , on Friday Rousseff repeated claims that she was the innocent victim of a â€œcoupâ€ � and said she would only give up the fight if the electorate voted against her .
Rousseffâ€
™ s appeal to the Guardian and a handful of other foreign news organisations appears to be a last - ditch attempt to win away after losing catastrophically at home .
As a result of recession , political upheaval and a huge corruption scandal , her government is deeply unpopular with the Brazilian media , the countryâ€ ™ s Congress and in public opinion .
But Rousseff has not been charged with any crime and many are uneasy that she is being impeached on a technicality by opposition politicians who stand accused of far more serious wrongdoing .
Rousseff warned that removing her from office would have serious consequences for the Brazilian political process .
â€œI am willing to fight to ensure that Brazil will not be a country where the democratic rule is broken , â€ �
she said , speaking from Brazilâ€ ™ s official residence in Manhattan .
â€œI am a victim of a plot.â€ � â€œIn the past , coups were carried out with machine guns , tanks and weapons .
Today all you need are hands that are willing to tear up the constitution ,
â€ � she said .
Outside , dozens of supporters waved signs that read â€œDefend democracyâ€ � and â€œStop
the coupâ€ � .
Close by , another group of protesters supporting impeachment gathered , carrying signs that read â€œItâ€ ™ s not a coup , itâ€ ™ s
justiceâ€ � .
Rousseff is accused of using dubious accounting tricks to fund welfare and other government programs ahead of the last election .
She rebutted these charges in painstaking detail , saying that such tactics were common not just in Brazil but other countries .
She said if impeachment was approved by the Senate she would report to the international community â€œthat this is a coupâ€ � .
She said it would be up to the international community what they did with that information but added : â€œThere is no possibility that my voice may be constrained.â€ �
The president said that the leadership of some nations had privately expressed sympathy and she was prepared to demand the suspension of Brazil from the Mercosur bloc of South American nations if there was a breakdown in the democratic process .
In Brazil the opposition has criticised Rousseff for taking her lobbying efforts overseas .
They fear she is trying to discredit and delegitimise any administration that replaces her .
The opinion battle has moved into the US media .
The Brazilian vice - president Michel Temer â€ “ who is poised to replace Rousseff â€ “ told the Wall Street Journal the president was damaging Brazilâ€ ™ s reputation and undermining its chances of securing foreign capital .
In an interview with the New York Times , he said : â€œIâ€ ™ m very worried about the presidentâ€ ™ s intention to say Brazil is some minor republic where coups are carried out.â€ � Three of the countryâ€ ™ s 11 supreme court judges have also rebuked the president for using the word â€œcoupâ€ � to describe a process that they say is permissible under the constitution .
Rousseff said she had only come to New York to sign the Paris climate change accord at the United Nations on Friday .
During her speech at the UN general assembly , Rousseff hardly mentioned the turmoil at home and mostly discussed her nationâ€ ™
s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Toward the end of her remarks , however , she observed that Brazil was facing a â€œgrave momentâ€ � .
Regardless of what happened in the political realm , she said in the interview with a handful of foreign media organisations , she would support the coming Olympic Games in Rio .
â€œNeither
I personally nor any member of my administration would ever propose a boycott of the Olympics ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œYou can rest assured that the upcoming Olympics will be a success.â€ �
But how she will reconcile this with her own battle for survival remains unclear .
If senators decide to investigate her impeachment , which is likely in mid - May , Rousseff will have to step aside for 180 days until they make a final judgment .
This means that by the time the Olympics begin in August , she will probably be deprived of power and awaiting her fate .
Rousseff said she was undaunted : â€œI will fight until free , [ and ] direct elections are held if I am removed from office ,
â€ �
she said , calling that scenario â€œa hypothetical situationâ€ � that she did not believe would occur ."
2016-04-23,"1 ) Political turmoil Brazil ’s congress voted last Sunday to impeach the president , Dilma Rousseff , on allegations that she manipulated government accounts before her re - election in 2014 .
Rousseff – who lost the vote against her by 367 to 137 – could be forced to step aside for 180 days , although she has denounced the impeachment to the United Nations and many Brazilian politicians have also been implicated in a corruption scandal involving the part - state - owned oil company Petrobras .
It is against this turbulent backdrop that the 2016 Olympics will take place , two years after Brazil hosted a World Cup marred by protests in numerous cities against stadium costs , corruption and the eviction of people from their favela homes .
Brazil ’s economy is in a torrid state and in the grip of a serious recession , with GDP having shrunk significantly and millions of people taking to the street in recent weeks to protest against the government .
2 )
Infrastructure race Against this troubled backdrop Olympic preparations are still progressing as Brazil desperately attempts to ensure that all venues and transport links are completed before the opening ceremony at the Maracanã stadium , on 5 August .
Of major concern has been the metro extension intended to connect the Olympic Park in Barra de Tijuca with the rest of the city .
It has not been finished , although officials claim it will be ready for the completion deadline on 1 July and will transport more than 300,000 people each day and significantly alleviate traffic problems in Rio .
On Thursday an elevated cycle path over the sea , built for the Games at a cost of £ 8 m , collapsed and killed at least two people , with the cause unknown .
However , the president of the organising committee , Carlos Nuzman , has previously maintained that the country will deliver a “ spectacular Games ” and that the political and economic woe will not affect the event .
According to the city ’s website , the velodrome is only 83 % completed because of problems in laying the track , while the tennis centre is 90 % ready .
The overwhelming majority of venues , though , are on course .
3 )
Zika concerns The mosquito - borne virus that has spread across many countries in South and Central America
has caused serious concern in Brazil .
British athletes preparing to compete at the Games have been issued with guidance on dangers and prevention .
There is no vaccination for Zika , which can lead to babies being born with underdeveloped brains , and the World Health Organisation has declared the outbreak a global public health emergency with an estimated 1.5 million people infected .
However , the International Olympic Committee is confident that the Games will not be affected by the virus and organisers are hopeful that the dryer , cooler climate in August –
Brazil ’s winter – will help ease the problem .
Officials say stagnant water at venues is being drained and that possible mosquito breeding grounds will be eliminated by medical experts .
It remains to be seen if any athletes deem the situation so serious in the coming months that they decide not to compete .
4 ) Pollution at sailing venue
Arguably of more concern for some competitors will be the water pollution at Guanabara Bay , where the sailing events will be held .
The bay is overlooked by Rio ’s Sugarloaf Mountain and Christ the Redeemer statue which will undoubtedly provide an impressive backdrop for the cameras and spectators , but for a number of years the bay is where much of the city ’s sewage and rubbish has been dumped .
The former chief executive of World Sailing , Peter Sowrey , claims he was fired after trying to move Olympic sailing to Búzios , a coastal resort about 100 miles from Rio , because of the pollution , saying he was “ told to gag myself on the subject ” .
When Rio won the right to stage the Games , it pledged to clean up its waterways but independent testing of locations where sailing , rowing , canoeing and open - water swimming will be held show the presence of disease - causing viruses at levels thousands of times above what would be acceptable in European or United States waters .
5 )
Ticket sales and local apathy Around half of the 7.5 m Olympic tickets remain unsold , with the Paralympic Games sales having barely got off the ground .
The Zika virus could be a factor in the low level of foreign purchases but a major issue has been domestic apathy .
At the beginning of April the new Brazilian sports minister , Ricardo Leyser , was quoted as saying “ there is a perception that the Brazilian population has not yet woken up for the Games ” , amid suggestions that tickets could be given to school children in an effort to ensure venues are full .
Olympic ticket prices range from 40 Brazilian reais ( £ 8 ) to 4,600 reais ( £ 907 ) , while officials say that Brazilians usually purchase tickets at the last minute and that there will be a late uptake in sales .
There has not been the same level of protests as witnessed before the 2014 World Cup but it is fair to say that the Games do not have total support from Brazilians .
Evicted residents from the Vila Autódromo favela – making way for the Olympic Park – protested in the streets , while the decision to build the golf course on an Area of Environmental Protection angered local campaigners .
6 ) Russia ’s athletics ban Away from the domestic troubles , the most intriguing element of the Olympic build - up centres on Russia ’s disgraced athletes .
An independent report commissioned by the World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) last year found the country guilty of running a state - sponsored doping programme , resulting in Russian athletes being banned from all international competition by the IAAF in November .
It sent a seismic shock wave through the sport that is the Olympic ’s blue riband event .
Last week Russia announced planned reforms to restore the credibility of its anti - doping system but continues to send out mixed messages .
Yesterday its sports minister Vitaly Mutko told Germany ’s Der Spiegel that Russia has “ done everything ” to be reinstated , adding : “ Our athletes have the moral right to be in Rio .
”
A decision on whether to reinstate Russian athletes before the Olympics will be made in Vienna on 17 June by an IAAF taskforce led by the former Wada director Rune Andersen .
It will be a huge moment for the IAAF president , Sebastian Coe , and for the sport as a whole .
Allowing Russia back in could see the credibility of the Games suffer , yet upholding the ban would cause major political ructions ."
2016-04-27,"The Olympic torch is lit , the stadiums are mostly complete and the athletes are in the final stages of their training , but instead of celebrating Wednesdayâ€ ™ s 100-day countdown to the Games , many people in Rio de Janeiro are wondering : â€œWhat more could possibly go wrong?â€ �
Initially seen as a blessing that prompted jubilation on Copacabana beach when it was first announced in 2009 , South Americaâ€ ™ s first Olympics is threatening to become a curse for the shell - shocked host city .
From political turmoil to economic recession , Rio has been hit by a series of national and local calamities that have overshadowed preparations , undermined confidence and prompted questions about who stands to benefit from the mega - event .
Among the litany of problems were : an impeachment vote against Dilma Rousseff that has divided the nation ; the biggest corruption scandal in the countryâ€ ™ s history ; the deepest GDP decline in decades ; the regionâ€ ™ s worst health crisis â€ “ Zika virus
â€ “ in memory ; and water pollution so bad
that Guanabara Bay , which will stage the sailing contests , stinks of excrement .
Recent headlines only add to the sense of dismay .
On Monday , an ombudsman reported that 11 workers have died so far working on Olympic projects , compared with eight for the 2014 World Cup and zero for the London Games in 2012 .
Last week , at least two people were killed when a new cycle path collapsed into the Atlantic Ocean just four months after it was opened .
Earlier in the month , tourists and shoppers in upmarket Leblon were shocked by grenade explosions and machine gun fire during the latest outbreak of gang violence .
Meanwhile , there are growing concerns about public spending cuts , which have prompted strikes that have paralysed hundreds of schools , sparked warnings from medical unions that the health system is ill - prepared for Zika , and forced Olympics organisers to find alternative funding for the air conditioning in the International Broadcasting Centre .
More worryingly , it also prompted the state police budget to be reduced by 2bn reals ( Â£380 m ) , despite intelligence warnings that Islamic State radicals could see the Olympics as their next target .
Add to this appalling traffic congestion ( ranked third worst in the world ) , poor ticket sales ( barely half of Olympic seats and one - fifth of Paralympic seats have been sold ) , rising unemployment , worsening inflation , persistent challenges with inequality , police killings of black youths and statements in favour of torture , misogyny and military dictatorship by the cityâ€ ™ s most - voted - for politician , Jair Bolsonaro .
It all means Rio enters the Olympic home straight looking more like an old school Latin American republic than the modern emerging economy that is about to take its place at the global top table .
But there is far more to Rio , and perceptions can change quickly .
With about the same amount of time to go before the 2014 World Cup , the focus was on possible protests and delays in stadium construction .
Neither proved to be major problems and the event was widely considered a success , despite the pain of the hostâ€ ™ s 7 - 1 semi - final defeat and the legacy of expensive white elephants .
Compared with that , the Olympics appear to be in a healthy position with no major protests and most infrastructure on time and on budget â€ “ though there are lingering concerns about the velodrome and a subway line extension .
Organisers of Rio 2016 say there is much to be proud of .
Although they admit the public is distracted and somewhat demoralised , they see the Olympics as part of the solution for Brazil rather than the problem .
â€œI think the Games are one of the few good things that will happen this year , â€ � the sports minister , Ricardo Leyser , told the Guardian .
â€œIt can reanimate the country and generate jobs .
In this hard moment , the games help us to reactivate the economy and bring in tourists.â€ � Mario Andrada , a Rio 2016 organising committee spokesman , expects the mood to pick up after the torch relay , which started last week in Athens , reaches Brazil , with the public then getting excited once Brazil wins its first gold .
But for the moment , he admits the situation is tough .
â€œI am not glossing .
You saw the cycle path .
But I am confident , â€ � he says .
â€œWe are now in the most difficult time , the last 100 metres .
Everything that can go wrong does go wrong .
But as soon as we get the torch going and the athletes in Rio , then the energy changes.â€
�
Many participants are equally optimistic .
Some hope for more economic and political stability by August .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think the crisis will get in the way and if everything goes well things will have gotten better by then , â€ � predicted the yachtsman Fernanda Decnop .
Uncertainties persist , particularly about national leadership .
In this period of intense political tumult , Brazil has gone through three sports ministers in little more than a year and could soon see a fourth if the vice - president , Michel Temer , forms a new government while Rousseff undergoes impeachment by the senate .
It also raises the question of which of the two presidents will represent the nation at the opening ceremony .
SÃ © rgio
PraÃ§a , an academic at the GetÃºlio Vargas Foundation , is scathing about the political climate .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think there is any mood for the Olympics in Brazil , and much less so in Rio de Janeiro , â€ � he says .
â€œEverything weâ€ ™ ve seen up to now is really bad , very negative .
There hasnâ€ ™ t been any good news about the Olympics .
Itâ€ ™ s 100 % the fault of city hall , the federal government and the state government.â€
�
For him , this is part of a bigger problem of staging huge sporting events , which serve the interests of a small segment of society at the expense of the majority .
â€œFor the politicians , the Olympics can be great .
But for the population in general , these mega - events like the World Cup and the Olympics are bad .
It moves people from their homes , triggers a lot of public investments that arenâ€ ™ t necessary .
We have empty stadiums that arenâ€ ™ t being used from the World Cup ...
These arenâ€ ™ t events for the Brazilian population â€ “ the price is too high.â€ �
For others , it is a missed opportunity .
Luiz Martins de Melo , a specialist on the economics of sport at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro , was part of the team that drew up the cityâ€ ™
s bid for the Olympics in 2004 .
He is disappointed that more was not done to clean up Guanabara Bay , but he says the event can still be a short - term success .
He expects the political situation to stabilise and for Cariocas â€ “ as the cityâ€ ™ s residents are known â€ “ to ensure the Games are fun , because sociological studies have shown they are more predisposed to public displays of joy than people from other cities .
But with job losses expected after the Games , he is pessimistic about the longer - term impact .
With the exception of Barcelona and London , he says most hosts fail to benefit .
This is because the Olympics is designed for wealthy nations , he adds .
â€œIn its current mould , these are events for developed countries due to the logistics , infrastructure and the luxury of the installations , particularly for sports that only exist in rich countries , â€ � he says .
â€œWho is going to watch badminton in Brazil ?
Who is going to watch rugby sevens in Brazil ?
â€œThe party will be great .
The legacy for the city will be garbage.â€ �"
2016-04-28,"Dilma Rousseff , the embattled president Brazilian president , has acknowledged the possibility that she may not play any official role during the Olympic Games if the senate passes an impeachment motion against her .
The Brazilian parliamentâ€ ™ s lower house last week overwhelmingly approved a motion for her impeachment .
If the senate follows suit in the next few weeks , Rousseff may have to step down as early as May â€ “ three months before the Games start in Rio de Janeiro .
She will be at least temporarily replaced by a centre - right administration led by vice - president Michel Temer .
â€œIf that happens , I will be very sad . ...
I would very much like to take part in the Olympic process , because I helped build the effort from day one , â€ �
Rousseff told CNNâ€ ™ s
Christiane Amanpour in an interview to be aired on Thursday .
Rousseff is accused of using dubious accounting tricks to fund welfare and other government programmes ahead of the last election .
She has rebutted these charges in painstaking detail , saying that such tactics were common not just in Brazil but other countries .
Low approval ratings , she said , should not be what fuels a push to remove a democratically elected leader from office .
Since her election in 2010 , the Brazilian president has seen her ratings plummet amid an economic recession and bribery scandal involving the state - run oil company Petrobras .
But Rousseff has not been charged with any crime and many are uneasy that she is being impeached on a technicality by opposition politicians who stand accused of far more serious wrongdoing .
In her CNN interview , Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president said her gender had contributed to efforts to her problems .
â€œI think there is a very strong element that has to do with the fact that I am a woman , â€ �
she said .
â€œThey have often said that I was a very harsh woman.â€ �
â€œAnd I have always replied as follows :
â€˜Yes , I am a harsh woman , surrounded by cute , polite , gentle and kind men around me.â€ ™
Only women are described as being harsh in office when they take a position.â€ � Rousseff , repeating her argument that efforts to impeach her amount to a coup , vowed not to back down .
â€œI will fight to survive , not just for my term in office , but I will fight , because what I am advocating and defending is the democratic principle that governs political life in Brazil.â€

The Olympic flame was lit in Greece , at the start of a 15-week journey that will culminate with the 5 August opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro ."
2016-05-04,"In what are expected to be her last days as president of Brazil , Dilma Rousseff has reportedly been accused by the countryâ€ ™ s prosecutor general of obstructing justice .
The criminal allegation â€ “ which she denies â€ “ adds the risk of prison to the woes of the Workers party leader , who is likely to be forced to step aside next week while the senate debates a separate impeachment motion against her .
If the request for an investigation is accepted by the supreme court , it would also tarnish her reputation by placing her for the first time among the targets of the high - profile Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) inquiry into political kickbacks from the state - run oil company , Petrobras .
Among those already under investigation are the former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , the house speaker , Eduardo Cunha , the leader of the senate , Renan Calheiros , and about 50 other prominent lawmakers from across the political spectrum .
According to local media , the prosecutor general , Rodrigo Janot , has ramped up the ante this week by asking permission from the supreme court to investigate 30 cases .
As well as Lula â€ “ who is described as the ringleader of the Petrobras corruption scheme â€ “
they are said to include two of the most prominent figures in the opposition Brazilian Social Democracy party â€ “ AÃ
© cio Neves , the losing candidate in the 2014 presidential election , and lower house deputy Carlos Sampaio â€ “ as well as heavyweights in the powerful Brazilian Democratic Movement party , such as Senator Romero Juca and the Rio de Janeiro mayor , Eduardo Paes , the leading figure in the organisation of the upcoming Olympics .
Worst hit , though , has been the Workers party , which looks set to lose power next week for the first time in 13 years .
Among those whose cases were referred to the supreme court this week are Lula , the social communications minister , Edinho Silva , Jaques Wagner , who heads the presidentâ€ ™ s office , and the attorney general , JosÃ © Eduardo Cardozo .
The biggest news , however , was the reported inclusion of Rousseff , who is accused of trying to impede the Lava Jato investigation .
Until now , Rousseff has not been implicated in a crime , unlike many of her accusers in parliament .
Rousseff says she is innocent and blames a plea bargain by Senator DelcÃ­dio do Amaral .
â€œAny opening of an investigation I am sure will show that Senator DelcÃ­dio do Amaral was lying , â€ � Rousseff told domestic media .
In his testimony , Do Amaral also said a â€œgodfatherâ€ � role at Petrobras was played by Vice - President Michel Temer , who is expected to form a new government next week .
However , Temerâ€ ™ s case does not appear to have been referred to the supreme court .
Janot has yet to confirm the investigations or to explain his motive for acting now , in the dog days of the Workers party administration .
Some commentators speculate that he is helping the new administration by tarnishing the reputation of the old .
Others suggest he is pushing ahead as quickly as possible due to uncertainty about the future of the Lava Jato investigation under a new justice minister .
The supreme court must now decide whether to accept Janotâ€ ™ s requests , a process that could take months or years ."
2016-05-05,"Brazilâ€ ™ s supreme court have voted unanimously to suspend the speaker of the lower house , Eduardo Cunha , while he is investigated for alleged corruption , intimidation of lawmakers , obstruction of justice and abuse of power .
The decision adds to the political turmoil in Latin Americaâ€ ™ s biggest country , following last monthâ€ ™ s lower house impeachment vote against president Dilma Rousseff , who will probably be forced to step aside next week for up to 180 days while the senate examines the charges against her .
But it is likely to be cheered by the public as a positive response to a request filed last December by prosecutor general Rodrigo Janot , who accuses Cunha of being a â€œdelinquentâ€ � whose misdemeanours including threats to the head of the house ethics council .
Supreme court justice Teori Zavascki accepted the speaker should be suspended because he used his position to try to influence investigations into his alleged crimes .
Prosecutors in the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into a massive kickback scheme at state - oil company Petrobras say they have evidence that Cunha used secret Swiss bank accounts to stash more than 5 m reais ( $ 1.4 m ) in bribes .
The house speaker â€ “ who is an influential member of the powerful evangelical bloc and also the Brazilian Democratic Movement party â€ “ has denied the charges and said he will appeal , but among the public , he is even more reviled than Rousseff , who is blamed for a deep recession , political turmoil and widespread corruption .
A recent Datafolha survey found 77 % of the voters wanted Cunha to be stripped of his mandate , compared to 61 - 67 % for the president .
At times in the past year , these two unpopular leaders have resembled gladiators locked in a bloody combat that watching voters hope will result in both of their political deaths .
Last month , Cunha struck an apparently fatal blow by orchestrating the successful lower house vote to impeach Rousseff .
Now , however , he is struggling as the legal pressure against him mounts .
In his ruling on Thursday , Zavascki said Cunhaâ€ ™ s position as speaker â€œposed a risk to the criminal investigationâ€ � and represented â€œa harm that conspires against the dignity of the institution which he leads.â€ �
In a plenary session later that day , Supreme court judges voted 11 - 0 to uphold the suspension .
But the speaker â€ “ who is a notoriously shrewd political operator
â€ “ is far from defeated .
Even if the supreme court approves an investigation and later finds him guilty , however , he can not be ejected from congress unless a plenary of deputies approves his removal .
That would depend partly on his replacement as speaker , Waldir Maranhao , a Cunha ally who is also under investigation by Lava Jato prosecutors .
Police , however , say privately it is only a matter of time before Cunha is stripped of his parliamentary rights , which include a degree of immunity from the lower courts .
â€œIâ€ ™ m certain he will go to jail , â€ � a senior officer told the Guardian .
â€œThere is so much evidence against him.â€ � Roussefâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ party hope the judgeâ€ ™ s ruling will breathe life into their flagging campaign to halt impeachment .
The attorney general , Jose Eduardo Cardozo , said he plans to file an annulment request on the grounds that the vote was overseen by a speaker who now stands accused of abusing his power .
But after more twists and turns than would be credible in a series of House of Cards , nobody can predict the denouement of Brazilâ€ ™ s political drama with any certainty .
In the latest bizarre development , it has emerged that Vice - President Michel Temer - who is expect to form a new administration next week - is barred rom running for office for the next eight years because he violated campaign finance rules during the 2014 election ."
2016-05-05,"With less than a week until the Brazilian senate votes on the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff , the question facing the nation is no longer whether the Workersâ€ ™ party government will fall , but how far to the right the political pendulum will swing once it has fallen .
For Marco Feliciano â€ “ an ultra - conservative preacher - politician from the evangelical caucus â€
“
it can not go far enough in reversing what he sees as the malign policies introduced since the left came to power in 2003 .
â€œFor 13 years we have been anaesthetised .
Now we will see the renaissance of hope in Brazil , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œI donâ€
™ t just want the Workersâ€ ™ party to go , I want it to disappear from history , to fall into extinction.â€ � Speaking in his parliamentary office in BrasÃ­lia , the controversial Social Christian congressman said impeachment opens the door for a resurgent right â€ “ an alarming prospect for anyone on the left or in the centre who is worried about the polarisation of Brazilian politics .
His comments reflect the growing influence of the â€œbullets , beef and Bibleâ€ � ( BBB ) caucus , which aims to strengthen the military , expand agriculture and tighten restrictions on abortion , gay marriage and secular education .
There is still a long way to go before that happens .
In the short term , Vice - President Michel Temer is expected to form a centre - right administration for the 180 days of the senateâ€ ™ s deliberations on Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment .
But longer term , conservatives like Feliciano feel they are well placed to expand their influence .
They are already on the rise .
Three years ago , Feliciano was on the defensive after his appointment as head of the lower house human rights committee was challenged by civil rights groups .
They used old videos of sermons in which he called Aids a â€œgay plagueâ€ � and claimed John Lennon deserved to die because he had compared the Beatles to Jesus Christ .
Today , however , he is triumphantly on the offensive .
His most powerful political enemy , Rousseff , has been at least temporarily neutered .
And while he is reviled by the left , he is adored by the right , which now dominates social networks .
â€œIâ€ ™ m now
the second most â€˜likedâ€ ™ politician in Brazil
, â€ � Feliciano says as he opens up a laptop to display a social network ranking that puts him â€
“ with more than 3.5 m
likes â€ “ well ahead of the soon - to - be - removed president .
Close behind , he pointed out , was his controversial party colleague , Jair Bolsonaro , a former army captain and apologist for the 1964 - 1985 military dictatorship who caused a storm during the lower house impeachment debate by dedicating his vote to a notorious torturer of political prisoners from the 1970s , Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra .
Those comments caused outrage around the world , but added an extra half million â€œlikesâ€ � to Bolsonaroâ€ ™ s
Facebook page in just two weeks .
After joining forces in March , the two appear to have made a Blair - Brown type deal about who should run first for high office .
â€œBolsonaro will be our candidate for president in 2018,â€ � Feliciano said during the interview in his parliamentary office .
â€œI will run for the senate next time and the presidency later.â€ �
The BBB caucus â€ “ in some ways a radical Brazilian version of the Tea Party â€ “ has already expanded its presence in Congress , in the courts , in the streets and â€ “ with increasing importance â€ “ online .
The question is how far it can go .
The highest point so far was last monthâ€ ™ s lower house impeachment vote , which was instigated and overseen by the evangelical house speaker , Eduardo Cunha , who is accused of corruption , perjury and money laundering .
The supreme court suspended Cunha on Thursday for obstructing justice , but Feliciano has lauded his role .
In comments to the Brazilian media , Feliciano compared Cunha to the villain in the film Despicable Me , declaring : â€œIf he is evil , then he is my favourite type of evil because he got impeachment moving.â€
�
The strength of the conservative lobby was evident during the vote , when deputy after deputy dedicated their ballots to God , family or country .
Almost none actually mentioned Rousseffâ€ ™
s
alleged fiscal irregularities
â€ “ the issue they were supposed to be judging .
This highlighted a religious as well as political shift .
Many Catholic groups said they were alarmed that Godâ€ ™ s name was taken in vain .
The Brazilian Bishopsâ€ ™ Justice and Peace Commission told the Catholic News Service they felt â€œan overwhelming feeling of embarrassment and dissatisfactionâ€ � .
But the US - influenced evangelicals are now such a strong lobby that even Vice - President Temer â€ “ a Catholic who is expected to replace Rousseff within weeks
â€ “ had to pay homage .
In the midst of hectic negotiations about who should be in his new cabinet on Wednesday , Temer made time to pray with Silas Malafaia , the head of the Godâ€ ™ s Victory in Christ Assembly .
Asked if impeachment had created new opportunities for the evangelical bloc , Feliciano beamed : â€œVery much so , â€ � he said .
â€œIn 2010 , we had 60 seats .
Now 95 .
We elected Cunha as the speaker of the house .
Weâ€ ™ re growing.â€
�
In March , Felicianoâ€ ™ s Social Christian party was joined by Bolsonaro .
It was in many ways a political marriage between the most radical evangelical and the most controversial militarist , who together hope to conceive a new generation of ultra - right governments .
Bolsonaro brings backing from a wealthy Catholic elite to Felicianoâ€ ™ s grassroots campaign network of evangelical churches .
â€œBolsonaro Presidenteâ€ � T - shirts and placards were evident at recent pro - impeachment rallies .
According to the latest Ibope opinion survey , the former military man has the support of 11 % of voters , which means close to 15 million people endorse a supporter of dictatorship .
Thatâ€ ™ s a long way from the 54 million votes that Rousseff needed to clinch the last election , but enough to prompt debate about the consequences of a shrinking middle ground .
Jean Wyllys , a leftwing deputy with the Socialism and Liberty party , said he feared â€œfascism could re - emerge in the form of Bolsonaroâ€ � at the next election in 2018 .
Wyllys , a professor who was the first congressman to be elected on an LGBT rights platform , has arguably been the fiercest opponent of the extreme right and could one day be their challenger in a presidential race .
During the impeachment vote , he engaged in a spitting battle with Bolsonaro and his supporters .
Mainstream leaders say radicals are out of step with Brazil .
â€œThere is polarisation in politics , but not in society , â€ � former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso , told the Guardian .
â€œThe evangelicals are having a more consistent role in congress , and are acting in a prejudiced manner , â€ � he said .
â€œAfter this political crisis , there needs to be an effort towards political unification .
We need to end this idea of good and evil.â€ �
Carlos Pereira , a political scientist at the GetÃºlio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro , said the countryâ€ ™ s democracy was sufficiently stable to resist radicals .
â€œAs in many European countries , extremists , like Bolsonaro and Feliciano , have a niche in proportional representation systems .
Nevertheless , they are not viable candidates in any contest that requires them to secure a majority , such as a campaign for mayor , governor or president , â€ � he said .
â€œThey are not credible contenders for executive positions.â€
�
Others , however , say political instability and the ongoing Lava Jato corruption investigation could so badly erode mainstream politics that outsiders could rise to power .
Rafael Cortez , a political analyst at SÃ£o Paulo - based consulting firm TendÃªncias , said this created a risk that Brazil might see as figure emerge like Silvio Berlusconi in Italy after the â€œClean Handsâ€ � anti - corruption operation .
Overall , however , he was optimistic that moderate voices would prevail in the democratic system despite the polarisation of recent years .
More confident still was David Fleischer , a political scientist at the University of BrasÃ­lia , who said the result of impeachment was more likely to be a shift to the middle .
Rousseff , he said , had failed because she ignored centrist allies .
He pointed out that there was now a move to expel Bolsonaro from the house of deputies because he went too far in his praise of Ustra .
Certainly , there are limits to the rise of the right .
Even if the 22 % of the population who consider themselves evangelical all voted as a bloc â€ “ which is unlikely given the differences between churches â€ “ that would mean only 44 m votes , which is not enough to take power .
But Feliciano predicts his party will grow in influence and soon be represented in government â€ “ if not in the next cabinet , then the one after .
He is also reaching out to a wider audience by moderating his tone when needed .
He told the Guardian he had been demonised by his enemies and misunderstood by the public .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not homophobic .
I have friends who are gay .
There are people who frequent my house who are gay , â€ � he says .
But pressed on what this means in terms of policy , he says he is opposed to any moves to legalise gay marriage .
But there is atonement on the subject of John Lennon .
Feliciano admits he was wrong to call the three bullets that killed the singer â€œthe Father , Son and Holy Ghostâ€ � but says it was a mistake made more than 2o years ago that he has long since changed his views about .
â€œWhen
I was a child , I thought as a child , â€ �
he says , quoting scripture .
â€œNow I realise Lennon is a genius and a poet .
I can sing Lennon.â€ �
And with that he croons the opening of Imagine ."
2016-05-06,"Less than a week into May
and I am already certain that it will be one of the most fraught months of my four years in Brazil .
This is not so much because of the haywire political situation and the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff , the president , nor the upcoming Olympics in my home city of Rio de Janeiro .
It is not even the Zika epidemic , nor the economic recession .
Instead , my rising level of stress is primarily driven by the impending expiration of my journalism visa , which means that for the next few weeks , I will be mired in what must surely rank among the most Kafkaesque bureaucracies in the world .
This is a country where I once had to provide the names of my father and mother , as well as my address , phone number , tax registration code and passport details , simply to buy a T - shirt at a small town department store .
To proceed with an online newspaper subscription , I recently had to reveal whether I was married and give my parentsâ€ ™ names .
Woe betide anyone who can not provide details of their bloodline .
In Brazil , form filling appears to be something of a national pastime .
The more inquisitive and complex , the better .
That may come as a surprise particularly if you â€ “ like me , before I moved here
â€ “ have an image of Brazil as a modern , relaxed , informal , happy - go - lucky kind of country .
But the reality , at least in terms of paperwork , often turns out to be old fashioned , rigid , time consuming , expensive and mindnumbingly inefficient .
As well as being a headache for individuals , it is a major drag on the economy and a huge disincentive for investment .
This was one of the biggest shocks when I first arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 , mistakenly expecting the bureaucracy involved in moving to Brazil to be easier than for my previous posting in communist China .
To get a journalism visa in Beijing in 2003 required a letter from my employer , proof of identity , an application form , copies of wedding and birth certificates for my family , and a health check , including an Aids test .
That was fiddly , to be sure , but once these were complete , the process was surprisingly quick , efficient , inexpensive and good natured .
Easier still , with the help of a good local assistant , was opening a bank account , getting a phone line and renting an apartment .
I was up and running much more quickly than I dared hope .
China , I decided early on , was a country in a hurry .
Brazil , by comparison , seemed determined to drag things out for as long as possible .
For the 44 years of my life in which I was not based in Brazil , the only time I recall using a registry or a notary office was to get married .
But in my first few months in Rio , I must have been more than two dozen times .
My signature was registered in four cartÃ³rios ( registry offices ) so I could validate the documents that I needed to rent a home , own a car , open a bank account and import my belongings .
I counted more than 100 pages of contracts , inventories , powers of attorney and other papers â€ “ all of which needed signing , stamping ( with glued cartÃ³rio stamps ) and , of course , queueing up and paying for .
Naturally , I started to hate cartÃ³rios .
But they were necessary , I was told , because in Brazil , documents are assumed to be fake until proven genuine by an array of stamps , seals and signatures from the relevant authorities and offices .
Mistrust , it seems , is part of the institutional furniture .
Take my bank .
Almost every month , I had to provide the manager with a letter explaining that cash transferred from the UK was my salary , rather than money I was laundering .
It was almost the same amount every month , but I still needed a new letter each time .
Initially , I tried to view this red tape from a wider and more optimistic perspective .
Perhaps , I wondered , rigid regulations would mean fewer crimes , higher safety standards , better labour conditions and stricter environmental protection .
But it was quickly obvious that this was not the case .
Instead , the contrary is often true : excessive bureaucracy is a recipe for inefficiency and corruption .
It has certainly been doing the economy no favours .
According to the World Bankâ€ ™ s 2012 Doing Business report , Brazil ranked 126th out of 183 countries when it came to the ease of starting a company .
I am told that the situation is better than in the past .
Regulations have been changed , meaning that cartÃ³rios , once the inherited monopoly of a handful of wealthy families , can theoretically be run by anyone with the relevant qualifications .
There have also been modest efforts to simplify the processes for opening bank accounts , renting property and starting companies .
But there is a long way to go before Brazil has anything like the flexibility , dynamism and competitiveness of China .
Given Brazilâ€ ™ s long list of problems , cutting red tape is unlikely to be high on the agenda of the interim government that the vice - president , Michel Temer , is expected to form next week if the senate moves ahead with the impeachment of Rousseff .
But in the longer run , it will be essential if Latin Americaâ€ ™ s most populous nation is to recover from its current slump .
In the meantime , I have to crack on with my visa renewal .
My letter of appointment from the Guardian has been printed , legalised , notarised and officially translated .
But I still have copies to make , queues to join and forms to fill in with my details , plus , of course , the names of my mother and father .
Probably something , somewhere , will not be quite right , so I will have to return again the next day , and perhaps the one after that .
I would not be surprised if I have to make a trip to the cartÃ³rio .
May looks set to be a long month ."
2016-05-09,"History may well prove to be kinder to Dilma Rousseff than her political contemporaries , a majority of whom have dumped Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president from power less than halfway through her second mandate .
Betrayed by her running mate , condemned by a corruption - tainted congress and taunted over the abuse she suffered as a prisoner of the dictatorship , the Workersâ€ ™ party leader suffered a huge blow on Thursday , when the senate voted to impeach her .
This entails her the suspension for 180 days , while senators decide whether she should be permanently removed from office .
She is accused of window - dressing government accounts ahead of the last election with cash transfers from state banks .
During this period , her place will be taken by Vice - President Michel Temer , who was elected on her coat - tails in 2014 but has since conspired to bring his former partner down .
The president â€ “ a former Marxist guerrilla who was imprisoned and tortured in the 1970s
â€ “ has railed against treachery and misogyny , and vowed to fight to the bitter end .
But her battle increasingly resembles that of an injured animal surrounded by predators moving in for the kill .
An outsider might find it easy to sympathize with Rousseff - the - victim , who was more high - minded and less tainted than most of her accusers and whose aim in office seemed genuinely to be improving the lot of her countrymen , especially those from poorer communities .
But for those who have had to work with her , live with her mistakes or investigate her colleagues for corruption â€ “ or worry about whether Brazil will ever emerge from its cascade of crises
â€ “ there is also a sense of relief that months of political gridlock may be coming to an end .
â€œImpeachment will be looked back on as a bad moment for Brazil , â€ � former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso told the Guardian .
â€œI tried to postpone it in my party [ the opposition Social Democratic party ] , but the government can not remain paralyzed like it is now.â€ �
That is not entirely Rousseffâ€ ™ s fault .
Given the fragmentation and the rightward shift of congress after the 2014 election , it would have been difficult for any leader to build a coalition , but Rousseff was particularly bereft of the charm , luck and deviousness needed to secure support .
Her Workersâ€ ™ party predecessor , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , had all three in spades , but even he also needed a system of bribes â€ “ later revealed in the MensalÃ£o ( monthly payment ) scandal â€ “ to buy the votes of smaller parties .
And it was under his watch that kickbacks from the state - run oil company Petrobras were ramped up to epic proportions to fund the election campaigns ( and sometimes lavish lifestyles ) of politicians across the political spectrum .
Lula â€ “ as he is universally known â€ “ and dozens of other lawmakers are now being investigated by prosecutors and judges in the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) operation .
Rousseff has not been charged , but she has indirectly benefited and is guilty at the very least of a sin of omission .
â€œShe didnâ€ ™ t organise the corruption , but she didnâ€ ™ t have the political ability to stop it so it captured her , â€ � Cardoso said .
â€œLula was captured too .
Dilma was more reluctant .
She had stronger values , but she did not have the strength to do anything about it .
In that sense , she was both an actor and a victim.â€ �
But to Cardoso , Rousseffâ€ ™ s
problems started long before the corruption scandals , mainly because she was more of a technocrat than a politician .
Her first run for president in 2010 was the first election of her life .
She was not used to winning over the public or doing deals with opponents .
â€œThings went wrong from the very beginning , â€ �
he said .
â€œLula is responsible for appointing her without consulting anyone.â€ �
Opinion polls suggest the rot started somewhat later .
Up until the middle of 2013 , Rousseff was one of the worldâ€ ™ s more popular leaders .
But an economic slowdown and the huge protests of that year saw her ratings begin a downward plunge .
Insiders say that among her chief problems is a tendency to be stubborn and secretive , perhaps dating back to her student years in Belo Horizonte , where she joined the underground resistance to the military dictatorship .
â€œSheâ€
™ s a terrible communicator , â€ � said Apolo Lisboa , a comrade from Rousseffâ€ ™ s early days in the clandestine Marxist group PolÃ­tica OperÃ¡ria ( Workersâ€ ™ Politics , or Polop ) .
â€œBut she is very determined.â€ �
That formative period as a guerrilla also proved her courage and loyalty .
Rousseff was arrested with a gun in her handbag in 1970 and sent to Tiradentes prison , where she was tortured with electric shocks , sexual abuse and beatings .
Fellow inmates said she was a source of strength because she never gave away colleagues .
After she was released , Rousseff married a fellow revolutionary and moved to the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , where she built a career as an economist , administrator and then minister and chief of staff in the Workersâ€ ™ party government before she became its candidate in 2010 .
Lisboa predicted she would be remembered kindly as a former torture victim who became the first woman elected president of Brazil .
The corruption accusations , he said , would fade with time because â€ “ unlike so many other politicians â€ “ she never benefited financially from bribes .
But he recognised that Rousseffâ€ ™ s intractable nature â€ “ which made her a doughty soldier and a trusted ally
â€ “ was not suited to political leadership .
In negotiation , it made her awkward and inflexible .
In ideology , it left her stuck in the 1970s .
â€œDilmaâ€ ™ s thinking is built on the assumptions of Newtonian thought and Marxist classics .
She does not understand the new world that has rapidly emerged as a result of globalization and technological development ,
â€ �
Lisboa said .
This is evident in Rousseffâ€ ™ s policymaking , which has tended more towards the expansion of previously existing welfare programs ( notably the bolsa famÃ­lia cash handouts to poor families and the Minha Casa , Minha Vida housebuilding scheme ) , rather than new initiatives to make Brazil more competitive , technologically advanced or environmentally sustainable .
Despite a last - minute rush of decrees to strengthen indigenous territory , few conservationists will lament the departure of a president who rolled back the Amazon - protecting Forest Code , entered alliances with agribusiness groups and marked what may well be her last week in office with the inauguration of the controversial Belo Monte hydroelectric dam .
Workersâ€ ™ party colleagues , however , say Rousseff was forced to focus on the economy because , unlike her predecessor , she could not count on a commodity boom to balance the books .
As a result of falling oil prices , slowing demand from China , the dire impact of the Lava Jato investigation on the construction industry and political paralysis , Brazil has slipped into a deep recession and seen its credit rating cut to junk status .
Getting out of such a mess requires vision , persuasiveness and strong alliances .
Rousseff was the wrong person at the wrong time .
Humberto Costa , the Workersâ€ ™ party leader in the senate , said the presidentâ€ ™ s integrity and lack of political experience made it hard for her to work with the legislature .
â€œShe doesnâ€ ™ t accept certain things that exist in Brazilian politics .
I donâ€ ™ t even mean in terms of corruption
â€ “ I mean in dealing with private and party interests and political power
plays.â€ �
This is all the more difficult because she is a woman in a manâ€ ™ s world : less than 10 % of congress and 14 % of the senate is female .
â€œI have no doubt that her being a woman makes this worse ,
â€ � Costa said .
â€œBrazilian political culture is very patriarchal and disrespectful towards women .
This manifests itself more intensely with a female president.â€ �
He , too , acknowledged that Rousseff failed as a communicator not just in the basic political tasks of convincing the public and working with congress , but even in sharing ideas with colleagues .
â€œThere was a time when ministers felt uneasy to express their opinions , â€ � he admitted .
She has certainly been slow to reach out beyond an inner circle .
It was not until 2014 that she â€ “ even through her aides
â€ “ became active on social networks .
For most of the past six years , she has also largely ignored the foreign media .
In the past month , she may well have given more interviews to overseas journalists than in the previous six years .
Despite such shortcomings , Costa argued the president does not deserve the treatment she has suffered .
He believes she has been dragged down undemocratically by an old elite that wants a smaller state and less social spending .
â€œDilma will be remembered as someone very serious and honest with an enormous social sensibility , but who had difficulty in dealing with the ins and outs of Brazilian politics , â€ � Costa predicted .
A warrior to the end , Rousseff said last week that she would fight until her last breath because anything else would betray the 54 million people who voted for her .
Describing her vice - president as a â€œusurperâ€ � , she said that regardless of the senateâ€ ™ s decision , she would ultimately be vindicated in the consciousness of the Brazilian people .
â€œThatâ€
™ s where we know history will make clear who is who in this process , â€ �
she said , repeating again that she would never resign .
â€œFirst , because I am the elected president ; second , because I have committed no crime ; third , because if I resign , I leave and bury the living proof of a coup with absolutely no legal basis and which aims to hurt the interests and the achievements gained over the past 13 years .
I have the willingness to resist .
I will resist until the last day.â€ �
Additional reporting by Shanna Hanbury"
2016-05-09,"Brazilâ€ ™ s political tumult has descended into farce after a little - known and newly appointed lower house speaker proclaimed the annulment of last monthâ€ ™ s impeachment vote against Dilma Rousseff .
The surprise move â€ “ which was immediately challenged by senior figures in the senate
â€ “ provided an absurd twist in the countryâ€ ™ s ongoing political drama that would stretch the credibility of a House of Cards plot .
Just days before the senate was expected to adopt the motion and suspend the president , Waldir MaranhÃ£o â€ “ who took over as acting speaker last week
â€ “ appeared to have thrown Rousseff a lifeline by saying the vote needed to be rerun due to procedural flaws .
The Workersâ€ ™ party leader was crushed in a boisterous and sometimes bizarre lower house impeachment vote on 17 April when more than two - thirds of deputies agreed that she should be removed from office for whitewashing government accounts with money borrowed from state banks ahead of her 2014 re - election campaign .
But MaranhÃ£oâ€ ™ s calls for the senate to return the process to the lower house were met with derision .
â€œTo accept this joke would be to play with democracy , â€ � said Renan Calheiros , the head of Brazilâ€ ™ s senate , in vowing to push ahead with a debate on whether to investigate the head of state .
â€œThis has no legal or practical effect , â€ � said Senator Raimundo Lira , who â€ “ like the vice - president , Michel Temer â€
“ is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) that split from the ruling coalition earlier this year .
â€œThe lower house chamber lost complete control the moment that case was handed to the senate.â€ �
Unless there is an intervention by the supreme court , the senate vote is now likely to go ahead on Wednesday .
Few , even in the Workersâ€ ™ party , believe Rousseff will win .
Temer , who split with his former running mate , has already begun canvassing candidates for the interim government he expects to form later this week .
But MaranhÃ£o â€ “ a previously obscure politician from the Progressive party
â€ “ has thrown a spanner into the works .
In a news release on Monday , he said the vote needed to be rerun due to procedural flaws .
To do this , he called on the senate to return the impeachment process to the lower house .
MaranhÃ£o â€ “ who , like many Brazilian politicians , is under investigation for corruption â€
“ said the vote was flawed because the president was not given a final opportunity to defend herself and many deputies announced their votes ahead of time .
Rousseff gave a cautious response to the news .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not official .
I donâ€
™ t know the consequences .
We should be cautious , â€ �
she told local reporters , as she repeated her determination to keep fighting .
The political circus prompted confusion and embarrassment , even among experts and insiders .
â€œYou know what the whole world should be thinking about us , Brazilians ?
Laughingstock , â€ ™ â€ ™ observed the former chief justice Joaquim Barbosa .
Analysts said the annulment was likely to be overturned .
â€œThis decision by MaranhÃ£o wonâ€ ™ t prosper .
Even if the senate accepts his decision , which is unlikely , the supreme court will probably have the last word on the subject and they are unlikely to approve , â€ � said Sylvio Costa of Congress in Focus .
Temer , who was expected to form a new administration this week , has yet to comment publicly .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s
tormentorâ€“in - chief Eduardo Cunha â€ “ the former speaker of the house â€
“ called MaranhÃ£oâ€ ™ s decision , â€œabsurd , and irresponsibleâ€ � .
Cunha , was himself suspended last week by the supreme court on the grounds that he was interfering in the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) corruption investigation into alleged kickbacks from the state - run oil company , Petrobras .
MaranhÃ£oâ€ ™ s motives are the source of immense speculation .
Last month , he defied his party line to vote against impeachment .
Upon his appointment as interim speaker , he was reported as telling congressmen : â€œYou all will be surprised with me.â€ � Chico Alencar , a PSOL politician , said Cunha may be behind this move .
â€œIs this just to create confusion ?
Who cares about this chaos ?
Will some will say that Cunha must return?â€ � he tweeted .
If MaranhÃ£o has his way , the re - vote will take place within five sessions .
If not , the senate will go ahead with impeachment .
If a majority of the 81 senators concurs then Rousseff will be suspended from office for 180 days while the upper house sits in judgment against her and Temer takes the helm .
The president â€ “ a former Marxist guerrilla who was imprisoned and tortured in the 1970s
â€ “ has railed against treachery and misogyny , and vowed to fight to the bitter end .
Anything else , she said , would betray the 54 million people who voted for her .
Regardless of the outcome of the decision in the lower house or the senate , she said would ultimately be vindicated in the consciousness of the Brazilian people .
â€œThatâ€
™ s where we know history will make clear who is who in this process , â€ �
she said , repeating again that she would never resign .
â€œFirst , because I am the elected president ; second , because I have committed no crime ; third , because if I resign , I leave and bury the living proof of a coup with absolutely no legal basis and which aims to hurt the interests and the achievements gained over the past 13 years .
I have the willingness to resist .
I will resist until the last day.â€ �
Adding to the sense of chaos , the Lava Jato investigation continues to wreck havoc in the political and business worlds .
Dozens of senior executives , congressmen and senior figures in the government and opposition have been arrested , charged or referred to the supreme court .
Among them are former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , the heads of the upper and lower house and the runner - up in the 2014 presidential election , AÃ © cio Neves .
The latest to be targeted by police is the former finance minister Guido Mantega , who was taken in for questioning on Monday ."
2016-05-09,"For most Brazilians , this weekâ€ ™ s expected ejection of Dilma Rousseff from the Planalto palace is unlikely to be cause for much mourning .
But it may well prompt wailing and gnashing of the teeth at one of the countryâ€ ™ s favourite spoof social media accounts .
For much of the past six years , the fake Facebook and Twitter character â€ “ Dilma Bolada ( which very roughly translates to badass or sassy Dilma )
â€ “ has been more popular than the president it sympathetically lampoons .
Full of bravado , this virtual diva Dilma acts like a North Korean dictator with John Stewartâ€ ™ s sense of humour .
In many ways , she is everything the real president is not : brash , vain , mocking , ready to lap up the spoils of power â€ “ and brilliant at online communication and tapping into the zeitgeist .
â€œThe first , only and eternal president , â€ � reads the official description of the page , which carries a portrait of the young bespectacled Rousseff during her Marxist guerrilla days , and a garish background image of the normally dour leader with a bow and arrow that makes her look more like the heroine of the Hunger Games or the character in a role - playing fantasy .
It is the work of a twentysomething Jefferson Monteiro , who has described himself as an admirer of the president .
His gentle mockery has proved a hit with 1.6 m likes , several awards and sponsorship revenue .
In 2014 , it also appears to have inspired Rousseff and her aides to up their game by belatedly reactivating the official account of the president .
The latest post is a photoshopped image of a beaming Rousseff giving the finger to a caption reading â€œBela , Recatada
e Do Larâ€
�
( Beautiful , Demure and Domestic ) â€ “ a mocking reference to a recent Veja magazine cover that profiled the wife of the vice- president , Michel Temer , using these adjectives .
That article has been widely derided for its conservative image of the ideal woman , particularly at a time when the countryâ€ ™ s first female president is being forced from power .
Memes on this and other subjects abound on the vibrant and sometimes aggressively over - the - top online world of Brazil , which has roughly 80 million Facebook users , behind only the US and India .
But in the past year , the right has dominated the political debate on social networks as the fortunes of Rousseff and the Workersâ€ ™ party have faded .
Today , Facebookâ€ ™ s top three most â€œlikedâ€ � politicians in Brazil are the pro - market conservative AÃ © cio Neves , who narrowly lost to Rousseff in the last election , followed by the evangelical preacher - congressman Marco Feliciano , and then the ultra - right Jair Bolsonaro , who is an apologist for the 1964 - 1985 military dictatorship .
Rousseff is a distant fourth .
These controversial characters provide plenty of material for satirists , but given the increasingly venomous political atmosphere , it is as yet hard to imagine they will generate the same affectionate , tongue - in - cheek parody evident in Dilma Bolada ."
2016-05-11,"We are wrapping up our live coverage of a momentous couple of days in Brazilian politics now .
Thanks for reading .
Our latest report from Brasilia , as Michel Temer unveils his new ( 100 % white male ) cabinet , is here : Brazil has a new interim president , Michel Temer , who previously served as vice - president under Dilma Rousseff .
In Temerâ€ ™ s first speech as president , he said the country needed to â€œrestore respectâ€ � to the government and that he would focus on the economy .
Twenty - two cabinet ministers were sworn in , along with Temer , at the presidential palace on Thursday afternoon .
The ministers are all white men , the first time since 1970 that no women have been in cabinet .
Rousseff , the countryâ€ ™ s first female president , has been suspended for six months after the Senate voted to launch an impeachment trial against her .
She is allowed to in her presidential home while the impeachment trial goes on .
Rousseff gave a defiant speech before leaving the presidential palace , where she was greeted and hugged by former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva .
Rousseff vowed to fight the impeachment , which she calls a â€œcoup.â€ � Scenes on Brazilian TV showed the violent scuffle outside the Presidential Palace as a group of anti - Temer protesters attempted a lie - in on the ramp up to the building .
A guard sprays a female protester in the face and then beats her on the leg with a baton .
From a reporter leaving after the Temer speech : Temer lauded the importance of the slogan on national flag â€œOrder and Progress , â€ � during his first speech .
Brazilâ€ ™ s new president said he hadnâ€
™ t expected it to be such a raucous celebration during the swearing in ( thanks to the large crowds and constant cheering ) , noting that it was a time for seriousness .
In Rio di Janeiro , some residents of Jardim BotÃ¢nico - a middle class neighorbood just next to the fancy beach â€˜burbs of Copacabana and Leblon - are creating their own protest during Temerâ€ ™ s speech .
Inside , Temer is still giving his first talk as president , but is struggling with his voice .
Clearly the long night of the impeachment has caught up with him , his voice cracking constantly and at times unable to speak .
Temer referenced Lava Joto , the corruption investigation , and said it must be protected .
Female protesters attempting to enter the presidential palace were sprayed with tear gas by police , according to reporters outside .
The women were attempted to enter where president Michel Temer is currently speaking .
This video apparently shows when the team from Globo , a major broadcaster , were struck .
New president Temer is now speaking , with a lot of emphasis on building the economy .
But he notes that he knows Brazil is a poor country and that social protections will remain to protect the needy .
The new ministers - 22 of them , all male - are being sworn into their roles .
A livefeed from Globo shows a very crowded room of men cheering and occasionally signing pieces of paper to become a minister .
Just in case you werenâ€ ™ t sure , Temer was announced officially to reporters .
Michel Temer finally arrives at the presidential palace to speak to reporters for the first time as president of Brazil .
Hopefully Temerâ€ ™ s first presidential press conference goes better than a radio interview he did today , where he mistook an Argentinian radio presenter for the countryâ€ ™ s president , Mauricio Macri .
â€œHow are you President ? ...
I want to visit you soon ,
â€ �
Temer told a reporter from the El Mundo radio station , according to a Reuters report .
Temer was not informed of his confusion during the interview .
When questioned about how the impeachment proceedings and drama was unfolding , Temer said he felt â€œvery calm ... concerned about the situation , but weâ€ ™ re going to face it with a lot of enthusiasm.â€ � A small crowd of protesters have gathered outside the building in Brasilia where Michel Temer will soon host his first press conference as interim president .
Inside , journalists are filling up the room in anticipation of his first speech .
Barely one day as president , and already interim president Michel Temer is hit with a scandal .
It seems someone hacked the phone and internet accounts of Marcela Temer , the new first lady of Brazil , stole intimate photographs ( itâ€ ™ s unknown exactly what the pictures show ) , and then attempted to extort the Temers .
As Reuters reports : Brazilian police have arrested three people on charges of hacking the internet account of the wife of Brazilâ€ ™ s interim president and attempting to extort money after stealing intimate photographs , the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said on Thursday .
The newspaper said that police had arrested the hacker , his wife and his sister - in - law on Wednesday .
A police spokesman declined to comment , saying that the case was ongoing . ...
The alleged hacker , who worked as a roofer , gained access to Marcelaâ€ ™ s cell phone and internet accounts 30 days ago , the newspaper said .
He , his wife and sister - in - law had attempted to extort money from the Temers , Folha reported .
It did not name them .
Brazilâ€ ™ s interim president Michel Temer , who was vice - president under Dilma Rousseff , will soon address the public .
While we wait for that , letâ€ ™ s have a little look at some juicy tidbits on the new president .
From a Guardian profile published last month : Compared with the colorful firebrands that make the most noise in the Brazilian political world , the 75-year - old constitutional lawyer cuts a quiet and somewhat gothic figure with grey , slicked - back hair , a stately bearing and a young beauty queen of a wife who has her husbandâ€ ™ s name tattooed on her neck . ...
The youngest of eight children in a family of Lebanese Christians who migrated to SÃ£o Paulo in the 1920s , Temer studied law and entered congress in 1987 .
A calm and methodical organiser and moderator , he quickly rose to a senior position in a party known for dealmaking rather than ideology .
For reasons unknown , the internet does not have a clear photo of the Temer tattoo .
From a Washington Post profile published earlier today : He is the author of Anonymous Intimacy , a book of sensual verses inspired by his wife , Marcela , who was a 20 year - old aspiring beauty queen when she became Temerâ€ ™ s third wife in 2003 . ...
He is sometimes mocked as â€œThe Butlerâ€ � because he is said to resemble a character in a campy horror movie , and is the kind of restrained figure who seems to knows much but say little in public .
A report says Globo , a major TV network in Brazil , has asked its stars to â€œgo lightlyâ€ � in public on social media about the Senateâ€ ™ s vote on impeachment proceedings .
But Globo presenter and actress Monica Iozzi is tweeting and posting about the impeachment , including this retweet of a message written by actress ( formerly in Globo telenovelas ) Patricia Pillar .
Journalist Glenn Greenwald , who lives just outside of Rio de Janeiro , insinuates in this tweet that the impeachment of Rousseff was simply a move by opponents to oust her party from power .
PT refers to the Workers Party , the center - left party that has ruled the country since 2002 .
The Cato Institute , a libertiarian think tank created by the billionaire Koch brothers , says the impeachment proceedings against Rousseff offer a rare chance for politicians to be held accountable against corruption .
Ian Vasquez , director of the Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity , said in a statement : Nobody is surprised that corruption exists at high levels in Brazil .
The real story in Brazil is that institutional and policy changes in that country over the past several decades have led to a situation in which some of the most powerful memberâ€ ™ s of Brazilâ€ ™ s political establishment and business elite are now being legally tried and convicted for wrongdoing .
All of Latin America is watching in surprise at , and applauding , this level of accountability that judicial systems in the region rarely attain .
The coming impeachment of Rousseff will not solve Brazilâ€ ™ s problems , but the strengthening of the rule of law that it represents puts the country on a stronger path for stability and development .
Hereâ€ ™ s a rundown of President Temerâ€ ™ s new cabinet .

During Dilma Rousseffâ€ ™ s last hours in office , supporters of her impeachment trial and pro - Rousseff campaigners gathered outside the Brazilian congress to await the senate vote .
Reporter Ana
Terra Athayde was there .
Interim president Michel Temer released the names of his cabinet team .
But after the countryâ€ ™ s first female president , the new round of ministers is distinctly male .
In a just released video , Dilma Rousseff declares there is â€œno reasonâ€ � for her to be impeached as , she says , she committed no crime , received no bribes and wasnâ€ ™ t involved in corruption .
She called the Senateâ€ ™ s vote to begin an impeachment trial of her a â€œdecisive moment for Brazilian democracy and our future as a nation.â€ � â€œWhat is at play is the future of the country , â€ � said Rousseff , who said her impeachment was â€œfraudulentâ€ � and a â€œtrue blow to democracy.â€ �
She notes in the video that 54 million Brazilians voted to elect her president and that those votes should be respected .
Rousseff said her opponents have fought her presidency since the beginning and openly conspired to impeach her , and that their actions resulted in constant political instability that has affected the countryâ€ ™ s economy .
â€œMy government has been a target of intense and incessant sabotage , â€ � said Rousseff .
Brazilâ€ ™ s senate has voted by 55 to 22 to suspend the countryâ€ ™ s first women president , Dilma Rousseff , for six months .
She will have to step aside while she is tried in the upper house for allegedly manipulating government accounts ahead of the previous election .
Rousseff gave a defiant speech before leaving the presidential palace , accusing her opponents of political opportunism and of carrying out a â€œcoupâ€ � .
She vowed to fight the charges , saying : â€œI may have committed errors but I never committed crimes.â€ �
The vice - president Michel Temer , accused of similar transgressions , has taken over as interim president .
His support in parliament means he is unlikely to face any charges .
Temerâ€ ™ s cabinet , announced on Thursday , is 100 % male and 100 % white .
It is said to be the first time since 1970 that there have been no women in the cabinet .
This is the moment Rousseff received a consoling hug from her predecessor as president , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva outside the presidential palace .
She then addressed the crowd of her supporters .
Not sure if this is how Temer would have imagined his ascendancy to power .
Here are some more quotes from Rouseffâ€ ™ s press conference .
I may have made mistakes
but I did not commit any crime .
Rousseff called the impeachment â€œfraudulentâ€ � and â€œa coupâ€ � .
I never imagined that it would be necessary to fight once again against a coup in this country .
AP says she compared the pain of being impeached to the torture she suffered under the countryâ€ ™ s past military dictatorship .
Itâ€ ™ s the most brutal of things that can happen to a human being to be condemned for a crime you didnâ€ ™ t commit .
Never will I stop fighting .
The new interim president has announced his cabinet .
It is reportedly 100 % male ( for the first time since 1979 ) and 100 % white .
Meanwhile , Temer is officially the interim president .
Rousseff has been making another speech to supporters outside the presidential palace , with her predecessor standing beside her .
According to Reuters she told supporters she feels their energy and warmth but said it is a tragic time for Brazilâ€ ™ s young democracy .
She repeated that she is the victim of a great injustice .
Here are some more striking pictures of the suspended Brazilian president leaving the building : Rousseff has left the presidential palace : The outgoing president has referenced her battle against cancer , in stressing her determination to fight impeachment .
Rousseff says she has been subjected to a coup by her political opponents and will continue to fight impeachment .
The suspended Brazilian president says democracy is at stake .
https://twitter.com/lourdesgnavarro/status/730764108912562176 Rousseff begins .
Ministers who served in Rousseffâ€ ™ s government as well as congress members from her party . are lining up behind the podium where she will speak .
Meanwhile , supporters are gathered outside .
Rousseff is due to speak shortly .
You can watch it live on Periscope :
Protesters chant â€œTemer , traitorâ€ � in the video below .
And beneath the video is an unflattering cartoon of the man who has stepped into Rousseffâ€ ™ s shoes .
The president of the International Olympic Committee is upbeat about this Summerâ€ ™ s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , despite recent events in Brazil .
Thomas Bach said : there is strong support for the Olympic Games in Brazil and we look forward to working with the new government to deliver successful games in Rio this summer .
He said preparations for the 5 - 21 August event â€œhave now entered into a very operational phase and issues such as these have much less influence than at other stages of organising the Olympic Gamesâ€
� .
He added : We have seen the great progress being made in Rio de Janeiro and we remain confident about the success of the Olympic Games in August .
Dilma Rousseff is yet to talk - two posts on her Facebook page , however , give her reaction to the vote to suspend her .
â€œÃ‰ GOLPEâ€ � - Itâ€ ™ s a coup .
The most recent of the two links to attorney general JosÃ © Eduardo Cardozo speaking in her defence at the end of the impeachment debate .
Here are some Rousseff supporters Brazilâ€ ™ s shrinking economy is widely considered to be one of the reasons behind Rousseffâ€ ™ s downfall .
Reuters reports that Temer is making plans to address the problem .
Brazilâ€ ™ s interim President Michel Temer will announce on Thursday measures to rebalance depleted fiscal accounts and generate new jobs in a country mired in its worst recession in decades , one of his top advisers told Reuters .
Temer will take office on Thursday after the Senate voted to suspend President Dilma Rousseff for up to six months to face trial for allegedly breaking budgetary laws .
â€œThis is start of a new era in which we have the challenge to find a solution to the biggest economic crisis in our history , â€ � said the adviser , Wellington Moreira Franco , who helped draft Temerâ€ ™ s economic blueprint .
â€œThe measures that will be announced have two objectives : Rebalance the fiscal accounts and revive economic growth to generate new jobs.â€ �
He confirmed that Temer will name former central bank chief Henrique Meirelles to be finance minister .
He added that Mansueto Almeida , a public accountsâ€ ™ expert , will likely be the next Treasury chief .
Memes of Rousseff leaving office are emerging on social media .
Only two members of Rousseffâ€ ™ s cabinet will stay under Temer , says NPRâ€ ™ s south America correspondent :
Another newspaper front page shows a picture of Temer being hung on the wall to replace one of Rousseff .
Senate president Renan Calheiros says that Rousseff will remain in the presidential residence despite being impeached and suspended by the senate .
From AP : Now that lawmakers have voted to impeach Rousseff , the chamber has up to 180 days to conduct a trial and then vote whether to remove her permanently .
Calheiros says that in the meantime Rousseff will have security guards , health care , and the right to air and ground travel , as well as staff for her personal office .
He also says sheâ€ ™ ll receive a salary , though he didnâ€ ™ t specify what it would be .
â€œA chancer for Temerâ€ � ( described by AP as â€œone of the countryâ€ ™ s least popular politicians ) , reads the front page of the digital edition of one of Brazilâ€ ™ s newspapers .
This shows how each individual senator voted : Iâ€ ™ m now handing the blog over to my colleague Haroon Siddique , who will be keeping you up to date with any reaction to todayâ€ ™ s monumental vote .
Temerâ€ ™ s cabinet is also rumoured to include Blairo â€œsoybean kingâ€ � Maggi , who is tipped for Minister of Agriculture .
In recent weeks he has been â€œadvancing a constitutional amendment that would effectively extinguish the requirement for environmental approvals on public building work , â€ � the Globe and Mail reports .
According to the Globe and Mail , Temerâ€ ™ s rumoured cabinet is entirely male and and entirely white .
Stephanie Nolan writes : Temerâ€ ™ s choice for the key post of finance minister is Henrique Meirelles , an economist and politician who served as a popular central bank president from 2003 - 11 .
Like him , everyone else on the rumoured cabinet list is male , and white , in a country that is 53-per - cent black and mixed race .
Many come from the powerful agribusiness and rural landowner bloc in Congress , and are associated with a dramatically different legislative agenda than that of Ms. Rousseffâ€ ™ s party .
What does impeachment mean exactly in Brazil ?
The New York Times attempts to answer that question .
In Brazil , Ms. Rousseff has not yet been impeached , legal scholars say .
â€œIn Brazil , the term impeachment is used only after a conviction is made in the trial , â€ � said Daniel Vargas , a law professor at FundaÃ§Ã£o Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro .
Now that Brazilâ€ ™ s Senate has voted against her on Thursday , Ms. Rousseff will have to step aside during her impeachment trial , which could last for six months .
But if she is ultimately absolved , she will not have been impeached , Mr. Vargas said .
Senator Romero Juca , from the opposition Democratic Movement Party , has said the 55 - 22 vote to impeach Rousseff suggests it would be very difficult for her to win her mandate back during the impeachment trial .
He said : It was a painful process , a process that has changed Brazil but it is necessary to change Brazil .
People today are having difficulties .
Thousands of people are losing their jobs every day , companies are closing .
Life is getting worse .
Itâ€ ™ s not possible to continue the way things are .

These photographs of the marathon Senate session and voting are worth a look .
Senator Humberto Costa of the Workers Party talks about the vote and future opposition to the government of Michel Temer :
So what do we know about Vice President Michel Temer , the man poised to become Brazilâ€ ™ s new leader ?
Reuters have put together a brief biography of a man who has spent decades in politics and is known for his quiet yet calculating demeanour , fine suits , and a penchant for poetry .
While Rousseff is known for her â€˜in - your - faceâ€ ™ style , those who have worked with Temer say he is serene and possesses a rare trait in Brazilian politics - the patience to listen to allies and adversaries alike .
The challenge before him is daunting .
Brazil is mired in its worst recession since the 1930s and he will have to make rapid moves to restore confidence .
Rousseff and her ruling Workers Party ( PT ) have branded Temer a traitor and say that impeachment amounts to a coup .
Temer bitterly broke with Rousseff five months ago , accusing her of sidelining him .
He has already chosen several key ministers who are heavy hitters in Brazilâ€ ™ s political and business classes and will clearly take a more liberal economic approach than the leftist Rousseff .
He honed his craft over several years in Brazilâ€ ™ s bare - knuckle lower house of Congress , where he was an ally to both centrist President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and leftist leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
Temer , 75 , earned a reputation for remaining above the fray .
He rarely raises his voice , is said not to curse and refrains from the wild gesticulation and theatrics his peers employ during debates .
â€œTemer is assertive , but not aggressive .
He speaks , but not too much .
Heâ€ ™ s restrained .
Yet he has shown he can negotiate with anyone , on the right or left , â€ � said Eliane Cantanhede , a political commentator with the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper and Globo TV who has covered the vice president for decades .
Supporters enthused that this would enable him to get things done .
â€œHe builds political bridges and will be able to win the congressional support to carry out the reforms needed to revive our economy and political system , â€ � said Deputy Darcisio Perondi , a member of Temerâ€ ™ s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party ( PMDB ) who has known the vice president for two decades .
But there are some doubts even among those eager to see a change .
Though Brazilâ€ ™ s stock markets and currency rallied at the prospect of a business - friendly Temer government , some investors have voiced concern at his low - profile leadership style .
They worry he will not be assertive enough to control a politically chaotic moment , and that he will not be able to withstand the ferocious opposition the PT has vowed awaits what it considers to be an illegitimate government .
Fireworks are reportedly going off in Brazil .
Read Jonathan Wattsâ€ ™ full report on Dilma Rousseffâ€ ™ s suspension from office , what one politician called the â€œsaddest day for Brazilâ€ ™ s
young democracyâ€ � :
Less than halfway through her elected mandate , Dilma Rousseff has been stripped of her presidential duties for at least six months after senators voted 55 - 22 to impeach her and put her on trial .
After what one politician called the â€œsaddest day for Brazilâ€ ™ s young democracyâ€ � , a majority of the senators voted after a late - running impeachment debate that they would vote to suspend the Workersâ€ ™ party leader , putting economic problems , political paralysis and alleged fiscal irregularities ahead of the 54 million votes that put her in office .
Rousseff , Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president , will have to step aside for at least six months while she is tried in the upper house for allegedly manipulating government accounts ahead of the previous election .
Her judges will be senators , many of whom are accused of more serious crimes .
Here is the latest take from the Associated Press on the voting results , which is seen as a victory for the pro - impeachment camp .
Brazilâ€ ™ s Senate has voted 55 - 22 to impeach the South American giantâ€ ™ s first woman president .
President Dilma Rousseff is accused of using accounting tricks to hide large budget deficits .
Rousseff will be suspended and replaced for up to six months by Vice President Michel Temer pending a trial in the Senate .
The trial will determine whether Rousseff can serve out her second term , or whether her ally - turned - enemy , Temer , will remain in the top job through the December 2018 end of the term .
The result represents a victory for the pro - impeachment camp .
It was significantly higher than the simple majority of 41 votes needed to suspend her .
It sends a signal that Rousseff faces an uphill battle to return to power .
Thursdayâ€ ™ s vote capped a marathon session in the Senate that lasted more than 20 hours .
This is the moment the results of the vote were announced , a historic moment in Brazil that brings to end 13 years of rule by the leftist Workers Party .
The charges against Dilma Rousseff will now be investigated in committee for up to 180 days .
Vice President Michel Temer will assume power during this period .
The vote has concluded with 55 votes in favour of suspension and 22 against .
â€œYou can vote nowâ€ � , the president of the Senate says three times .
Cardozo warned Brazil will become the â€œbiggest banana republic on the planetâ€ � if impeachment passes .
A vote is imminent .
You can watch a livestream below : Speeches from senators are now over , and the Attorney General Jose Eduardo Cardozo is speaking in defence of Rousseff .
The vote is now nearing , with a majority expected to vote in favour of impeachment .
In a session of the Senate in Brasilia now around 20 hours long , senators have been making speeches ahead of a vote that will decide whether President Dilma Rousseff will be suspended from her role .
Brazilâ€ ™ s president looks poised to be suspended from office after most senators said they would back moves to impeach her .
Of the 66 senators who have so far made speeches , 45 say they will back impeachment , 20 will oppose it , and one â€ “ former president Fernando Collor , who himself faced impeachment proceedings in 1992 â€ “ did not reveal his intention .
Some 71 of the total 81 senators have indicated they intend to make a speech before voting can start .
Itâ€ ™ s estimated that the formal vote will be held around 7 am local time ( 6 am EDT/11am BST/8pm AEST ) .
If the formal vote follows what senators have indicated , it will be well above the simple majority of 41 required to suspend Rousseff from the presidency for 180 days while congress decides whether she should be permanently removed .
The vice - president , Michel Temer , who is expected to step into Rousseffâ€ ™ s role on Thursday , has begun to assemble his ministry , with the current presidentâ€ ™ s aides indicating she will dismiss her own ministers and tell them not to help the transition .
Rousseff is due to make a public speech at 10 am local time on Thursday .
Scuffles have taken place outside the government buildings in Brasilia , where police have used teargas against pro - Rousseff demonstrators .
Iâ€ ™ m now handing over the live blog to my colleague Nadia Khomami in London , whoâ€ ™ ll continue to bring you updates through the official vote and beyond .
Thanks for reading .
Less than halfway through her elected mandate , Dilma Rousseff appears set to be stripped of her presidential duties for at least six months after a majority of senators said they would vote to impeach her and put her on trial .
After what one politician called the â€œsaddest night for Brazilâ€ ™ s young democracyâ€ � , more than half of the 81 senators declared in a late - running impeachment debate that they would vote to suspend the Workersâ€ ™ party leader , putting economic problems , political paralysis and alleged fiscal irregularities ahead of the 54 million votes that put her in office .
A formal vote is expected in the next few hours .
If all the senators vote as they have indicated , Rousseff , Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president , will have to step aside for at least six months while she is tried in the upper house for allegedly manipulating government accounts ahead of the previous election .
Her judges will be senators , many of whom are accused of more serious crimes .

Senator CÃ¡ssio Cunha Lima tweets that he now expects the vote to take place at 7 am local time ( 11 am BST/8pm AEST/6am EDT )
â€ “ more than 20 hours after the senate session started :
Latest tally of how senators have declared they will vote : 43 senators say they will vote in favour of impeaching Dilma Rousseff 20 senators say they will vote against one â€ “ ex - president Collor â€ “ made a speech but did not declare his intention .
Senator Humberto Costa , of Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ party , speaks now .
He says the impeachment is a means for those defeated in the 2014 general election to get their hands on power , usurping the votes of regular Brazilians .
The president is not a criminal , he tells the senate , waving a photograph of a younger Rousseff .
Senator JosÃ © Serra is up now .
Heâ€ ™ s likely to become a minister if / when Temer steps up to the presidency .
Serra tells the senate that to continue with Rousseff as president would be a bigger tragedy than impeachment .
Impeachment isnâ€ ™ t an exceptional event , he says , but a constitutional solution : The 62nd senator to speak , Walter Pinheiro , is now at the lectern .
Some 71 senators are due to make speeches ahead of the vote .
At 15 minutes each â€ “ the limit â€ “
we would still be more than two hours away from a formal result .
For those joining our coverage 18 hours into the senate session ( this is not a joke ) , hereâ€ ™ s a helpful recap via Reuters :
President Dilma Rousseff , who has been in office since 2011 , has seen her popularity crushed by Brazilâ€ ™ s worst recession since the 1930s and a two - year probe into a vast kickback scheme at state - run oil company Petrobras .
Rousseff was chairwoman of Petrobras when much of the graft occurred , but she has not been accused of corruption .
She stands charged with manipulating government accounts to disguise the size of Brazilâ€ ™ s fiscal deficit to allow her to boost public spending during her 2014 re - election campaign , a practice also employed by previous presidents .
The political crisis has deepened Brazilâ€ ™ s recession and comes at a time when Brazil hoped to be shining on the world stage as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August .
Opposition senators blamed Rousseff for running into the ground an economy now considered the worst performing among major developing nations , pursuing what they called populist policies that led to high inflation , recession and unemployment .
Rousseff has denied committing any crime that warrants impeachment charges .
She has called her impeachment a coup and vowed to fight the process until the last minute .
Iâ€ ™ m resurfacing this eye - opening read from the Guardianâ€ ™ s Latin America correspondent , Jon Watts , which spells out the rocky road ahead :
If the suspension of Rousseff goes ahead â€ “ as it now looks set to â€
“
the presidential line of succession will have been decimated in the past week , with possibly more to come .
Normally , this is how it looks : President Vice - president Speaker of the lower house Leader of the upper house Chief justice of the supreme court But hereâ€ ™ s the situation today : Almost suspended : President Dilma Rousseff will have to step aside if , as now appears certain , the Senate votes to put her on trial for â€œcrimes of responsibilityâ€ � as a result of alleged window dressing of government accounts .
Accused and fined :
Vice - president Michel Temer will probably form a government , but he is facing impeachment on the same charges as Rousseff .
He has also been named in two plea bargains in the Lava Jato ( â€œCar Washâ€ � ) investigation , making him one of the major figures in the bribery scandal at the state - run oil company Petrobras .
Suspended :
House speaker Eduardo Cunha was stripped of his position last week by the supreme court because he used his powers to obstruct the Lava Jato investigation .
He also faces charges of bribery and perjury .
His replacement , interim speaker Waldir MaranhÃ£o , is also under investigation for receiving bribes , and announced on Wednesday that he would soon step aside .
Many constitutional experts argue an interim speaker can not be considered in the line of succession .
Accused :
The head of the Senate and the man overseeing todayâ€ ™ s impeachment , Renan Calheiros , is the subject of 11 criminal probes , nine of which are related to Lava Jato .
Viable but near termâ€ ™ s end :
The supreme court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski is not under investigation but his mandate finishes in September , when he is due to be replaced by Carmen Lucia .
In conclusion : two of the five are likely to be suspended by Thursday , another two are under investigation , and the final potential successor is an unelected judge who is about to be replaced .
Iâ€ ™
d guess the odds on Lucia , who is not even in the frame right now , becoming president by the end of the year might be shorter than those last August for Leicester winning the Premiership .
Senators must still vote formally on the move to impeach Rousseff .
Thursday A vote will take place in the senate in the next few hours .
If , as now looks inevitable , there is a simple majority in favour ( 41 of the 81 senators , although reports suggest only 78 are likely to attend the vote ) , Dilma Rousseff is suspended from office for 180 days .
Vice - president Michel Temer assumes power on an interim basis .
Within 180 days The charges against her will be investigated in committee .
A full plenary of the senate , presided over by the chief justice , will then sit in judgment on Rousseff .
If two - thirds approve , she will be permanently removed from office and Temer will be president until the next election in 2018 .
Senator Blairo Maggi is the 58th senator to speak and the 41st to declare he will vote in favour of impeachment .
Assuming senators vote later as they have said they will , Dilma Rousseff will be suspended from office for 180 days while congress decides if she will be permanently ousted .
Brazilian TV network Globo reports that three senators are not expected to vote today .
Two â€ “ Eduardo Braga and Jader Barbalho â€ “ are on sick leave , it says , and another , Pedro Chaves dos Santos , has not yet taken office .
This would leave 78 senators available to vote on the impeachment process â€ “ in which case , the 40 senators who have so far said they will vote in favour would be enough to secure Rousseffâ€ ™ s suspension .
Forty senators have now declared that they intend to vote for the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff .
In a full senate of 81 , just one more vote would be needed to secure her suspension .
Not all senators have attended the session so far .
Paulo Paim , speaking now , says he will vote against the move to impeach , the 16th senator to do so .
Latest tally : 39 senators have said they will vote in favour of impeachment .
16 have said they will vote against .
When formal voting begins , a simple majority of 41 would see Dilma Rousseff suspended from office for 180 days .
In a lengthy session of the Senate in Brasilia , senators have been speaking ahead of a vote that will decide whether President Dilma Rousseff will be suspended from her role .
In the 16 hours since the session began , 55 senators have made speeches ( the 56th , Paulo Paim , is speaking now ) .
Some 71 of the total 81 senators have indicated they intend to make a speech before voting can start .
The Senate leader , Renan Calheiros , has predicted the vote will be held around 6 am local time ( 5 am EDT/10am BST/7pm AEST ) .
Most senators who have made speeches have declared how they intend to vote , with 39 saying they will back impeachment , 15 pledging to oppose it , and one â€ “ former president Fernando Collor , who himself faced impeachment proceedings in 1992 â€ “ not revealing his intention .
A simple majority of 41 will be enough to suspend Rousseff from the presidency for 180 days while congress decides whether she should be permanently removed .
The vice - president , Michel Temer , who is expected to step into Rousseffâ€ ™ s role on Thursday , has begun to assemble his ministry , with the current presidentâ€ ™ s aides indicating she will dismiss her own ministers and tell them not to help the transition .
Rousseff is due to make a public speech at 10 am local time on Thursday .
Scuffles have taken place outside the government buildings in Brasilia , where police have used teargas against pro - Rousseff demonstrators .
Associated Press files this dispatch from the late - night sitting : Brazilian senators have a long way to go to finish their debate on whether to impeach President Dilma Rousseff .
The chamber is still crowded , although there are more aides than senators themselves .
Older senators have gone off for naps and are having their aides call when their time to speak is about to come .
The Senate leader , Renan Calheiros , had hoped the body could vote on impeachment by late Wednesday .
He is now predicting that the vote can be held around 6 am local time ( 5 am EDT/10am BST/7pm AEST ) .
If a simple majority of the 81 senators vote in favour , Rousseff will be suspended from office and vice - president Michel Temer will take over for up to six months pending a decision on whether to remove her from office permanently .
Pro- and anti - Rousseff demonstrators have been waiting outside the government buildings for the conclusion of the Senate session â€ “ which could still be some hours away .
Polls have found a majority of Brazilians in favour of impeaching Rousseff , though many remain concerned about those likely to succeed her .
Latest tally of the 50 senators who have spoken so far : 35 say they will vote for impeachment 14 say they will vote against 1 ( Collor ) has not said how he will vote And another reminder : a simple majority is required to see Rousseff suspended .
On a full complement of 81 senators , with all members present , thatâ€ ™ s 41 votes needed for the impeachment process to go ahead .
So far , we have not seen all senators in the chamber .
However , that could of course change when voting officially begins .
We reach a milestone of sorts with the 50th senator to come forward to make a speech : Paulo Rocha .
Seventy - one senators are slated to have their 15 minutes at the podium before voting officially starts .
Lindbergh Farias , a senator for Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ party , is up now and despite the late hour
â€ “
itâ€ ™ s currently 1.30am in Brasilia â€ “ is making an impassioned speech , saying the prospective Temer government is â€œborn bankruptâ€ � and â€œpaving the way towards fascismâ€ � .
â€œWe will not recognise this government ,
â€ � he says .
â€œWe know the result today , â€ � he says , before exhorting colleagues to mount a strong opposition .
The senate is looking fairly sparsely occupied at this point , however .
Someone at the Associated Press is suffering from lack of sleep , if the headline on its latest report is anything to go by : Debate on future of Brazilâ€ ™ s president drones into 2nd day Fernando Bezerra Coelho , a former minister in Rousseffâ€ ™ s administration , has said he will vote to impeach her .
The removal of the president â€œwill not resolve the serious political and economic crisis experienced by the countryâ€ � , LÃ­dice da Mata adds .
She says Temer will struggle with a lack of legitimacy should he become president .
She will vote against impeachment .
Socialist party senator LÃ­dice da Mata has been speaking .
She says â€œall presidents and dozens of governorsâ€ � have committed the acts for which Rousseff is now condemned .
She adds that Temerâ€ ™ s move to assemble his new government before the impeachment process was even completed was a move that would make even House of Cards protagonist Frank Underwood blush .
We have now reached 34 senators announcing their intention to vote for impeachment , 10 against , and one â€ “ Collor â€ “ who made a speech but didnâ€ ™ t show his hand .
Fernando Henrique Cardoso , who was president of Brazil from 1995 to 2003 , has been speaking on CNN .
He thinks the senate vote will go against Rousseff : Probably the decision will be to continue to proceed with the impeachment process .
Having previously opposed the move , Cardoso says he recently decided to back impeachment : I was reluctant at the beginning because i know how hard is the process of impeachment â€
¦
Now is different .
Brazil is a sound democracy [ and ] the constitution is very clear .
Quizzed on why Rousseff is being pursued for flouting financial rules broken by former leaders , including Cardoso himself , he adds : Itâ€ ™ s quite different to what I did and President Lula â€ ¦ itâ€
™ s quite a clear case of impeachment â€ ¦
Itâ€ ™
s obvious that this is against the constitution .
On what happens next for Brazil , Cardoso says : There is an enormous amount of corruption , not only within government but sustained by people within government â€
¦ People donâ€ ™
t trust any more the political system , political life .
Since President Rousseff was not able to regain confidence â€ ¦ why was she proceeding the way she was ?
She was increasing the lack of confidence .
To me this is a more profound crisis than just the case of President Rousseff .
Senate leader enjoys a joke Ex - president Collor makes his speech Outside the Senate
So far , 41 of the 71 senators who have indicated they will speak in the debate ( of the 81 senators in total ) have said their piece .
Of these 41 : 31 said they would vote for impeachment 9 said they would vote against 1 did not declare his voting intention
The vote itself is not due to take place until around 4 am local time .
Dilma Rousseff has been preparing for defeat by planning her exit from the presidential palace , Reuters reports : Aides said she will dismiss her ministers on Thursday morning and tell them not to help a transition to a Temer government because she considers her impeachment illegal .
With a change of government imminent , Michel Temer plans to swear in new ministers on Thursday afternoon , Senator Romero JucÃ ¡ , head of his Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) , told reporters .
The presidentâ€ ™ s plan to dismiss all her cabinet
if and when the Senate suspends her will force Temer to hit the ground running , since he was counting on a gradual transition to a new cabinet .
Two Rousseff aides said , however , that the dismissal of her cabinet would exclude central bank governor Alexandre Tombini , and the current sports minister , who is scrambling to prepare for the Rio 2016 games .
Leaning toward a liberal economic policy , Temer has picked former central bank chief Henrique Meirelles to be finance minister and Itau Unibancoâ€ ™ s chief economist Ilan Goldfajn as head of the central bank .
An updated tally : so far 29 senators have said they will vote in favour of impeachment .
Nine have said they will vote against .
With your customary reminder : a simple majority is enough to see Rousseff suspended .
On a full complement of 81 senators , with all members present , thatâ€ ™ s 41 votes needed to impeach .
The vote itself will start after the 71 senators slated to speak have all had their turn .
We are currently on number 40 , Valdir Raupp .
Former president Fernando Collor de Mello , who himself faced impeachment by the senate in 1992 , speaks of a â€œcountry in ruinsâ€ � at the â€œapex of a crisisâ€ � .
Talking of the impeachment process he faced , Collor says he was falsely accused .
He appears to be talking about himself rather a lot .
â€œThere was no crimeâ€ � in his case , he insists .
Nonetheless he lost the presidency .
People did not listen to his advice about the current crisis , he says .
Amid coups , the presidency has enjoyed only â€œspasms of democracyâ€ � .
Collar is certainly opposed to his own impeachment vote of 24 years ago .
He did not say explicitly how he would vote today .
At the moment , though , we are watching Senator Armando Monteiro make his speech .
He was a minister in Rousseffâ€ ™ s government and opposes impeachment , which he says would â€œcause a serious institutional ruptureâ€ � in Brazil .
Fernando Collor de Mello , the first democratically elected president of post - military Brazil , is due to speak next .
He himself faced impeachment in 1992 â€ “ though he resigned before being disqualified by a vote in the senate â€ “ and as a senator is one of those facing investigation as part of the Petrobras scandal for allegedly taking kickbacks .
Sousa says there is a â€œsexist , misogynist aspectâ€ � to the action against Rousseff : Next up is Senator Regina Sousa , of Rousseffâ€ ™ s own Workersâ€ ™ party , who unsurprisingly says she will oppose what she describes as a â€œcoupâ€
�
: Brazil has had worse crises without deposing its leaders , she says , adding that in this instance the opposition had decided it did not want Rousseff to govern : Because those 15-minute speeches just arenâ€ ™ t long enough , some senators carry on even after the microphone is cut off : And with the 35th senator to speak â€ “ CÃ¡ssio Cunha Lima â€ “ weâ€ ™ ve now reached the halfway point of the 70 whose names were on the list to make a speech today .
Only 11 hours in .
Senator HÃ © lio JosÃ
© is speaking now .
He is the 34th senator to make a speech .
JosÃ © is a member of Temerâ€ ™ s PMDB and says the debate in the senate today has been â€œhigh levelâ€ � and â€œbrilliantâ€ � .
Associated Press sends this dispatch on unrest outside the senate tonight : Protesters supporting Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff have clashed with police on the lawn outside the Senate as senators debated whether to impeach the leader .
It wasnâ€ ™ t clear what sparked the short but intense confrontations .
Police used pepper spray to drive back protesters .
Demonstrators largely from feminist groups threw firecrackers at police lines .
Emergency service workers took several people out of the area after they fell ill with the effects of the clouds of pepper spray .
On the Senate floor , Communist party senator Vanessa Grazziontin expressed worry about what she called spiralling levels of â€œunnecessary violenceâ€ � directed at pro - Rousseff demonstrators .
A wall erected down the center of the lawn separated several thousand Rousseff supporters from a similar - sized group of pro - impeachment protesters .
On the pro - impeachment side , a Carnival - esque spirit reigned , with demonstrators sipping beers while decked out in the yellow and green jersey of Brazilâ€ ™ s beloved national soccer team .
Both groups were much smaller than the crowds that turned out for the 17 April impeachment vote in the lower house of Congress .
Get your snacks in : senate leader Renan Calheiros is saying the proceedings could continue until 5 am local time ( 4 am ET/9am BST/6pm AEST ) .
Senator Vanessa Grazziotin is speaking now .
She has previously called for the impeachment process to be suspended .
Tonight she tells senators that voting for Rousseffâ€ ™ s removal would be a fraud against the laws of democracy : â€œWhat hypocrisy , what lies!â€ � she tweets , with a reference to Lava Jato , or Operation Carwash , the investigation into the Petrobras scandal that has embroiled many of Brazilâ€ ™ s politicians â€ “ including a number of those calling for Rousseff to go : Grazziotin is greeted with hugs as she returns to her seat .
Senate speeches latest : we now have 25 senators who have declared themselves in favour of impeachment , and five against .
A reminder : a simple majority is enough to see Rousseff suspended .
On a full complement of 81 senators , with all members present , thatâ€ ™ s 41 votes needed to impeach .
But so far during this 10-hour+ session , the chamber has not had full attendance at any point .
Rousseff and Jaques Wagner , former defence minister , watch the crowds from inside the Planalto palace : Brazilian newspaper O Globo reports that current vice - president ( and presumptive president in the event of Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment )
Michel Temer is pressing ahead with the assembling of his new government , with the appointment of a new attorney general , FÃ¡bio Medina OsÃ³rio .
The current attorney general , JosÃ © Eduardo Cardozo , is expected to leave with Rousseff .
Chinaâ€ ™ s
censors arenâ€ ™ t keen to share the news of the impeachment vote : Hello , this is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog reins to take you through to the Senate vote in â€
“
I hope â€ “ a few hoursâ€ ™ time .
In the first 10 ( 10 ! ) hours of this session , 30 senators had their say , fewer than half of those scheduled to speak .
Senate leader Renan Calheiros has now pledged not to take a recess and push the proceeding through to a vote .
But it looks as if it will be the early hours of Thursday morning , Brazil time , before the result is official .
Ten hours into Brazilâ€ ™ s Senate debate about ousting President Dilma Rousseff from office , the pro - impeachment forces look certain to win tonightâ€ ™ s vote .
Rousseff stands accused of illegally using government funds to mask the true state of the Brazilian economy .
My colleague Claire Phipps in Sydney is going to take over our live coverage for the second half of this marathon debate and vote .
Hereâ€ ™ s where things stand at the moemnt Nineteen senators have declared they will vote to impeach the president .
Only four have said they will vote against the ouster .
The Senate needs a simple majority to impeach : 41 of 81 senators with all members present , though the chamber has not had full attendance at any point today .
Brief clashes broke out between protesters and police outside the Senate in Brasilia , with police firing teargas into the crowd and protesters throwing rocks in return â€ “ itâ€ ™ s not clear how the altercation began .
At least one person sought treatment from the gas .
Senate leader Renan Calheiros has declared he will not vote , although he is already referring to Rousseff in the past tense and to vice - president Michel Temer , a member of his party , as the next president .
Brazilâ€ ™ s supreme court rejected a last - minute appeal by Rousseff to halt the vote .
She has scheduled a speech for 10 am local time Thursday .
Senators defending Rousseff have denounced the impeachment fight as an attempted â€œcoupâ€ � , a movement â€œborn of hatred and revengeâ€ � , and an attempt to rewrite the election results that brought her to office .
Senators who want to put the president on trial have raised a variety of reasons for their votes .
One compared her to gangrene , another blamed her for Brazilâ€ ™ s economic crisis , a third blamed her for turning a blind eye to corruption , and a fourth said said he believed a court which found evidence of a â€œcrime of responsibilityâ€ � during her first term .
Should the Senate vote to impeach , Rousseff will be suspended for six months .
The Senate could also remove her from office permanently , but would need a two - thirds majority to do so .
Vice - president Michel Temer stands ready to assume office , but he and several other leaders in the line of succession â€ “ including Rousseffâ€ ™ s accusers
â€ “ could face criminal charges themselves for graft and corruption offenses .
And a historical note : only three of Brazilâ€ ™ s eight elected leaders since 1950 have managed to serve out their term .
If suspended , Rousseff will join the list of presidents removed from office .
The Senate debate has little of the chaos of Houseâ€ ™ vote last month , during which lawmakers pledged their decisions to family members , freemasons and the chief torturer of Brazilâ€ ™ s military dictatorship â€ “ under which Dilma Rousseff was herself tortured .
Instead the senators seem intent on turning the impeachment debate into something between a classroom and one very , very long advertisement for re - election .
After each of the senators gets a turn ( weâ€ ™ re about a third of the way through ) there are speeches to sum up the pro- and anti - impeachment arguments .
Then the Senate finally votes .
Three Brazils : red in support of the president against impeachment , yellow and green in support of her ouster , and a Congress whose senators , many of whom are accused of corruption , are debating criminal charges against the president .
The senators are still debating , and Senate leader Renan Calheiros maintains that everyone should have 15 minutes to speak , rather than five minutes as some senators suggest .
Yet he is also one of the few lawmakers in the room who is urging his peers to stay on some semblance of a schedule â€ “
he just threatened to suspend several lawmakers who wouldnâ€ ™ t stop talking or whose phones kept going off .
Jon Watts is still out with the crowd on the streets , where heâ€ ™ s met some of the people who were exposed to the teargas fired by police .
Neves expounds at length about how â€œthe Workersâ€ ™ Party is going back to ancient waysâ€ � , raising many of the arguments he made while campaigning against Rousseff in 2014 .
His vote should not be in doubt .
The presidentâ€ ™ s office has meanwhile said that Rousseff will speak to the press at 10 am local time Thursday morning , not immediately after the vote as originally planned .
And speaking of the old â€ ¦ The AP has been talking to some of the senators whoâ€ ™
ve declared their vote â€ “
none are mincing words about their feelings .
â€œTo improve the life of the nation we need to remove them[(Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ Party ] at this time ,
â€ �
Senator Magno Malta told a scrum of journalists outside the Senate floor .
â€œWe will start to breathe again and the doctor will say the nation has given signs of life and will be stable soon.â€ � â€œThe great day has comeâ€ � to â€œextract the nation from the claws of the Workersâ€ ™ Party ,
â€ � said Senator Ataides Oliveira , the fifth of 63 Senators slated to speak during the debate Rousseff â€œis
the one who is having to pay for everything
, â€ � said Senator Telmario Mota de Oliveira , who argued the countryâ€ ™ s problems shouldnâ€ ™ t be all pinned on the president .
AÃ © cio Neves , the man who Dilma Rousseff defeated in the 2014 presidential race and a leader of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party , now has the podium .
Heâ€ ™ s tipped to take a position of power such as foreign minister in the hypothetical presidency of Michel Temer , the vice - president .
Back inside the Senate , the anti - Rousseff coalition inches toward the halfway mark of declared votes needed for impeachment .
Brazilian police have set up barricades and a line of officers outside the Senate in Brasilia , where Jon Watts saw brief clashes between officers and protesters .
Inside Congress the senators have again come to order for debates .
Jon reports from the streets :
Police just fired a few volleys of teargas at anti impeachment protesters outside the Senate .
The protesters threw rocks and fireworks .
Hard to say which side started .
But seems to have calmed for the moment .
Couple of thousand people on this side of the â€œimpeachment wallâ€
� as they call the metal barrier that separates the pro and anti gatherings .
My colleague Jon Watts is with the crowds outside Congress in Brasilia , where police have fired teargas canisters after supporters of the president threw a few fireworks , he reports .
The parliamentary watchdog newspaper Congresso em Foco has published a list of Senators who are under investigation or have had their cases archived by the Supreme Court .
Alleged corruption does not discriminate by beliefs : according to the watchdog there are 24 active investigations for 81 senators , 14 of which involve the â€œCar
Washâ€ � bribery scandal of oil giant Petrobras .

Senate leader Renan Calheiros calls for a break in the floor speeches .
The pro - impeachment forces have nearly half the votes
â€ “ declared , at least â€ “ they would need to oust Dilma Rousseff from the presidency in a full Senate vote .
With all the senators present they would need 41 votes to impeach Rousseff and put her on trial for using government finances to mask woes in the economy .
Calheiros tells everyone to be back in less than an hour , in contrast to the + 100-minute break they took for lunch .
Outside the Congress , protesters continue to gather near my colleague Ana Terra Athayde , who films a bit of anti - corruption dancing .
As twilight turns to night in Brasilia , protesters line up in yellow and green to show a â€œWall of Shameâ€ � with their leadersâ€ ™ faces on it to Ana
Terra Athaydeâ€ ™ s camera .
Rousseff has found another ally on the floor .
Workersâ€ ™ Party senator Jorge Viana Acre tells the chamber : â€œThis impeachment throws the votes of millions of Brazilians in the trash!â€ � â€œWeâ€ ™ re living in institutional anarchy in our country , â€ � he adds â€ “ Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ Party seems grateful to have someoneâ€ ™ s defense to tweet out .
The tally declared on the floor is 17 for impeachment , three against .
Senate president Renan Calheiros took a break to say that the impeachment is trending on Twitter .
Senator Agripino Maia is making a long and convoluted speech about state banks and his experiences with them , related to the impeachment vote in only a very roundabout way .
He is not helping anybody who wants to actually impeach or defend the president .
But he has given NPRâ€ ™ s Lulu Garcia -
Navarro an excuse to unearth these stats about Brazilâ€ ™ s Senate , which has not only just cut Maiaâ€ ™ s microphone to get him to stop talking but is also composed of some very specific demographics .
Her source is a BBC Brasil analysis of the Brazilian Congress .
Brazil is more than 50 % black or mixed race , to give you a sense of how representative the Senate is of its constituents .
Ã‚ngela Portela , of the presidentâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ Party , says sheâ€ ™ ll vote against impeaching Dilma Rousseff .
Sheâ€ ™ s only the second to declare herself with the president in the Senate today , making the declared tally , so far , 15 for impeachment and two against .
The Senate needs a simple majority of the senators present , meaning 41 votes if all 81 senators are present .
Senate leader Renan Calheiros has said he will not vote to stay neutral .
If not all the senators are present the tally necessary for impeachment is lower : there are 73 senators in the chamber at the moment , for instance , then only 38 senators need vote for impeachment .
The Senateâ€ ™ s official Twitter account has itself admitted itâ€ ™ s going to be a long night before the senators finish having their say .
â€œCalheiros just tried and dismally failed to get the schedule back on track by cutting down the length of the speeches , â€ � my colleague Jon Watts reports from the chamber floor .
â€œHe was quickly put in his place and now says he will give Senatorsâ€ ™ their say in this historic session .
Great news if you are one of the few dozen politician who are yet to speak .
Awful for everyone else as we now face the prospect of a debate that could go on until breakfast time
tomorrow.â€ �
Senate leader Renan Calheiros has said he will not vote whether to impeach Dilma Rousseff , saying that he wants to stay neutral as the president of the chamber .
But he was already using the past tense when he spoke of the sitting president of the country , and started speaking in the future tense of vice - president Michel Temer , who is of the senatorâ€ ™ s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party ( PMDB ) .
â€œTemer needs the backing of Congress to carry out deep reforms , above all reform of the political system , if he becomes president , â€ � he told reporters between Senate sessions .
Reuters notes that Brazilâ€ ™ s glum economy appreciates the possibility that Temer could take power , â€œon hopes his team could cut a massive fiscal deficit and return the battered economy to growthâ€ � .
Two more say theyâ€ ™ ll vote for impeachment .
Senator Sergio PetecÃ£o admits :
â€œI wonâ€ ™ t say we should expect it to solve all the problems.â€ � PetecÃ£o is of the Social Democratic Party , which has taken many lawmakers whoâ€ ™ ve left Brazilâ€ ™ s rightwing Democrats , and he was formerly of a center - nationalist party .
On the other side of the ideological spectrum , Popular Socialist CristovÃ£o Buarque also says heâ€ ™ s voting for impeachment .
His decision has not made him popular among the leftists who continue to defend Rousseff , especially since Buarque was once of her party himself .
In between it all is Renan Calheiros , who variously chuckles at his peers , scolds them , and simply watches over it all in amusement .
The LA Timesâ€ ™ Vincent Bevins has the simile to beat .
If youâ€ ™ re catching up â€ ¦ weâ€ ™ re now at 13 senators whoâ€ ™ ve declared for impeachment , one in defense of Dilma Rousseff .
The Senate needs a simple majority of present senators to impeach the president , which would be 41 with all 81 senators present .
The senators of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party ( PMDB ) have agreed to give up their speaking time , my colleague Jon Watts reports from the Senate floor .
There are six of them so that saves 90 minutes
â€ “ but barring more sacrifices from dozens of other senators , weâ€ ™ re still on schedule to finish hours from now .
Meanwhile the leader of Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ Party , Humberto Costa , is paraphrasing Senator Motas defense of the president .
â€œThey want to change the results of the last election , â€ � he says of her enemies in Congress .
But based on the senators whoâ€ ™ ve spoken so far Rousseff appears to be in trouble .
Rousseff has found at least one friend in the Senate and a few outside it .
Senator TelmÃ¡rio
Mota took the podium to ask : â€œWhat country is this?â€ � â€œWe want a country that respects the law and the constitution and democracy , â€ � he said .
â€œThis impeachment was born of revenge , hatred and revenge.â€ �
The newspaper Correio Braziliense points out via tweet that Motaâ€ ™
s question happens to invoke the Brazilian rock band LegiÃ£o Urbana , whose third album was titled â€œWhat country is
this?â€ � And outside
, pro - Rousseff protesters are setting up for a show once the Senate finally gets round to voting .
Inside Congress , a football ( soccer ) star turned senator , RomÃ¡rio de Souza Faria , has taken the podium .
â€œItâ€ ™ s undeniable that the country is going through a very serious crisis , â€ � he says .
â€œThe crisis has a political element , but itâ€ ™ s not limited to this.â€ �
He says that senators have to take charge of the government and enact emergency measures .
As for Dilma Rousseff , he says â€œFrom everything Iâ€ ™ ve read , heard and understand , I have concluded that
thereâ€ ™ s
evidence of a crime of responsibility by the president.â€ � Heâ€ ™ s going to vote for impeachment .
Outside Congress , a small group of protesters circles for drums and a little half - hearted shuffle dance .
Senator Magno Malta is at the podium , the ninth senator of 68 who were slated to speak â€ “ Brazilian press are reporting that the Senate may skip some speeches to get to the actual vote .
Malta is not wasting his opportunity .
He too is in favor of impeachment .
Heâ€ ™ s waving an accusatory finger at the Senate and shouting at his colleagues about the dire state of Brazil , comparing corruption to diseases : â€œlike diabetics , we have to amputate the limbâ€ � .
He starts yelling about how Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ Party is â€œagainst the familyâ€ � and wants to legalize abortion .
â€œMy children educate me , not these people.â€ �
He receives polite applause once the bell rings out his time on the floor .
Many Brazilians have blamed Rousseff for dragging the economy into the worst recession in decades , and her impeachment hinges on related charges : using government funds to hide signs of trouble .
Senators LÃºcia VÃ¢nia and Zexe Perella have also brought up the economy : theyâ€ ™ re the sixth and seventh senators to speak in favor of impeachment today .
But does the future really look brighter with any of Rousseffâ€ ™ s successors ?
Brian Winter , vice - president of the American Society / Council of the Americas , writes for Vox that whoever replaces Rousseff has more to do than rectify her mistakes .
Her disastrous handling of the government budget ( and ensuing fudging of the numbers , for which she is facing impeachment ) , her refusal to engage in a new wave of economic reform , and her mismanagement of the corruption scandalat state - run oil company Petrobras have destroyed much of the goodwill and stability that previous governments in Brazil had painstakingly built over the past 20 years .
Vice - president Michel Termer would be â€œa clear upgradeâ€ � on economics , Winter continues .
Based on his probable picks for finance minister and other key cabinet positions , Temer will be much less likely than Rousseff to meddle in areas of the economy such as interest rates , or the rate of return for investors on infrastructure projects , that are best left to independent regulators or the private sector .
Temer may even take on longstanding obstacles to growth such as Brazilâ€ ™ s tax code ( which the World Bank has called the worldâ€ ™ s most complex ) and the gaping hole in its pension system .
But Temerâ€ ™ s going to have to make unpopular decisions if he wants to improve the economy , Winter argues â€ “ and thatâ€ ™ s assuming his own legal troubles do not torpedo his administration from the start .
Six senators have taken turns so far at the Senate podium ( of a planned 68 ) to argue for and against impeachment .
Most have spoken about the economic crisis â€ “ unemployment and inflation are hovering near 10 % â€ “ and Rousseffâ€ ™ s handling of it .
Two senators asked to delay the proceedings in Rousseffâ€ ™ s favor before the formal turns at debate began , but they were overruled , and the supreme court later rejected Rousseffâ€ ™ s appeal to halt the vote .
All six senators at the podium have argued for impeachment .
The most recent brought a chart .
The Senate is back at long last from its extended lunch break , with leader Renan Calheiro chatting idly before starting off the session to impeach the president .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t really rush history ,
â€ � he says , per Folhaâ€ ™ s Leandro Colon .
Humberto Costa , the leader of the Workers Party in the Senate , has all but admitted defeat for Dilma Rousseff , whose second term seems on the verge of an abrupt early end to the partyâ€ ™ s hold of the presidency .
â€œThere are no other paths for us but opposition , â€ � he just said in a televised interview .
On his Twitter account , however , he continues to rail against what he sees as a flawed process .
â€œIt is a scandal , this process of impeachment , â€ � he wrote in one tweet .
â€œFull of irremediable vices .
It is a typical constitutional coup , a civil military uprising.â€ �
In another he wrote : â€œthis impeachment process is clear : one side wants democracy , the other a coup.â€ � Rousseff will address Brazil after the Senate votes on her impeachment , perhaps reading the signs so far as a near certainty that Congress will put her on trial .
â€œWith the confirmed exist of Dilma , the balance will be in 52 years only four presidents will have been directly elected , â€ �
Folha reporter Fabiano Misonnave tweets .
â€œOf
those half suffered impeachment.â€
�
The senators take their time .
With few senators standing up for Rousseff so far â€ “ though we are only five speakers into a supposed 68 planned â€ “ impeachment and suspension are looking more and more likely .
At the Senate in Brasilia my colleague Jon Watts runs through the possibilities of what would happen next .
If the suspension of Rousseff goes ahead , the presidential line of succession will have been decimated in the past week , with possibly more to come .
Normally , this is how it looks : President Vice President Speaker of the Lower House Leader of the Upper House Chief Justice of the Supreme Court But hereâ€ ™ s the situation today : Almost suspended : President Dilma Rousseff will have to step aside if , as is almost certain , the Senate votes to put her on trial for â€œcrimes of responsibilityâ€ � as a result of alleged window dressing of government accounts .
Accused and fined : Vice President Michel Temer will probably form a government tomorrow , but he is facing impeachment on the same charges as Rousseff .
He has also been named in two plea bargains in the Lava Jato ( â€œCar Washâ€ � ) investigation , making him one of the major figures in the bribery scandal at the state - run oil company Petrobras .
Suspended :
House Speaker Eduardo Cunha was stripped of his position last week by the supreme court because he used his powers to obstruct the Lava Jato investigation .
He also faces charges of bribery and perjury .
His replacement , interim speaker Waldir MaranhÃ£o is also under investigation for receiving bribes , and announced on Wednesday that he would soon step aside .
Many constitutional experts argue an interim speaker can not be considered in the line of succession .
Cunha and Temer have become two of Rousseffâ€ ™ s greatest opponents in the government .
Accused :
The head of the Senate and the man overseeing todayâ€ ™ s impeachment , Renan Calheiros , is the subject of 11 criminal probes , nine of which are related to Lava Jato .
Viable but near termâ€ ™ s end :
The supreme court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski is not under investigation but his mandate finishes in September , when he is due to be replaced by Carmen Lucia .
In conclusion : two of the five are likely to be suspended by tomorrow , another two are under investigation , and the final potential successor is an unelected judge who is about to be replaced .
Iâ€ ™
d guess the odds on Lucia , who is not even in the frame right now , becoming president by the end of the year might be shorter than those last August for Leicester winning the Premiership .
Brazilâ€ ™ s supreme court has rejected her last minute appeal to stop the impeachment vote .
The presidentâ€ ™ s senatorial allies had argued this morning that the Senate should at least wait until the supreme court had ruled on the appeal , which was likely Rousseffâ€ ™ s last opportunity to prevent an ouster .
Senator Ataides Oliveira , the last speaker before the Senate ended its first session , harkened back to the antics of the House of Deputies when it was his turn at the podium .
He called for impeachment with arms waving , fists clenched and exhortations shouted to oust Rousseff from office .
Compared to the rambunctious , overwhelming vote to impeach Dilma Rousseff in the House last month , the mood is considerably more sombre in the Senate , my colleague Jon Watts reports from the floor of the chamber .
â€œAll the people here are broken hearted .
We donâ€ ™ t want this , but it is unavaoidable .
Brazil has come to a stop since last year , â€ � claimed Senator Marcelo Crivella , who , outside of standing for the Brazilian Republican Party is also a gospel singer and bishop of the evangelical Universal Church of the Kingdom of God .
â€œWe all recognise that [ Rousseff ] has done a good job during her life for the democracy of Brazil.â€ �
Despite these respectful words , Crivella , who was once allied with her Workers Party government , said that he would vote for impeaching the president because the country is mired in crisis and needs a change of economic policy .
On the opposite side of the debate is Venessa Grazziotin , a senator from the Communist Party who is opposed to the suspension of the president .
â€œThis is the saddest day in the history of our young democracy , â€ � she told the Guardian .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t a valid constitutional process , it is a coup that goes against the opinion of the majority in the 2014 election.â€ �
She had no hope that Rousseff might escape suspension , but the senator said the battle was not over .
She hopes that in the coming months , Brazilians will realise they have been robbed of their rights by removing the president .
â€œIf they suspend her today ,
Iâ€ ™ ll go to the streets to demand new elections ,
â€ �
Grazziotin said .
The views of just two senators are obviously not representative of the entire chamber , but there does seem to be an effort to treat the moment with gravitas .
That is partly what you would expect from the upper house â€ “
but it may also be because the boisterous and bizarre scenes of last monthâ€ ™ s House vote , which saw deputies behaving in a way that shamed many Brazilians and led to deeply critical coverage overseas .
Watchdog group Aos Fatos notes that 14 lawmakers are under investigation for corruption and graft in the Petrobras scandal , in which the state - run oil giant , businesses and lawmakers are accused of passing around $ 2bn worth of bribes for contracts .
Journalist Rachel Glickhouse translates the linked tweet .
Senator Ana AmÃ
© lia Lemos has invoked Pope Francis in her time on the floor , quoting him :
â€œI hope that Brazil will follow the path of harmony and peace.â€
�
Then she pulls out a copy of the Brazilian constitution as a prop .
Lemos supports impeachment , and has fought back adamantly against critics and Rousseff supporters who say impeachment is a â€œcoupâ€ � .
While Brazilian newspapers have found that around 50 senators plan to vote for a trial , itâ€ ™ s not clear that Dilma Rousseffâ€ ™ s
enemies have enough votes to bar her from office , the AP reports .
A survey by Folha of Sao Paulo suggests there are only 41 senators willing to remove her permanently , 13 fewer than needed .
The House voted 367 - 137 last month in favor of impeachment .
â€œDilma will be impeached for a variety of reasons , â€ � said Marcos Troyjo , a professor at Columbia Universityâ€
™ s School of International and Public Affairs .
â€œAnd the possibility of her coming back is zero.â€ �
Rousseff herself hasnâ€ ™ t been implicated in the graft and corruption scandals that have swept up many members of her party â€ “ and of former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula
da Silvaâ€ ™ s administration .
Rousseff was Lulaâ€ ™ s chief of staff and minister of energy â€ “ someone who should have known about the bribes and corruption that had taken hold of Brazilâ€
™ s state - run oil giant , Petrobras .
â€œThe people involved abused and took advantage of the opportunity to steal money in an absurd way , â€ � said Tiago Gomes da Silva , a 33-year - old standing in line at an unemployment office in Rio de Janeiro .
â€œThis had to come to an end .
And the actual government is directly linked to this.â€ �
Brazilâ€ ™ s economy has also staggered into its worst recession in decades , in large part due to the plummeting prices of commodities and petroleum over the last few years .
Inflation and unemployment are hovering around 10 % , and in her second term Rousseff has enjoyed none of the oil and mining boom that so profited Lula at the polls .
From the AP : â€œThe problem in Brazil was the inflation , â€ �
Carlos Antonio Porto Goncalves , economics professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation , said of Rousseffâ€ ™ s first years as president .
â€œAnd the government , to fight inflation , raised interest rates to extremely high levels so demand decreased , and the recession came.â€ �
With all of this is a growing perception that Rousseff doesnâ€ ™ t have the casual charisma of many senators , which has divided many Brazilians into camps that see her as more honest than her peers or too unwilling to make deals .
â€œShe is a woman with a knife in her boot , â€ � said Alexandre Barros , a political consultant in Brasilia , using a popular phrase in Portuguese to describe tough women .
â€œBut she is not a politician.â€ �
A protester has shown up at Congress wearing a word that needs no translation .
He points out that vice - president Michel Temer has also been found to have broken the law .
Impeach the lot of them , he says .
Temer could very well have an abbreviated term â€ “ as could other lawmakers accused of corruption , taking bribes and other crimes .
Rousseff has her supporters too , though .
My colleague Ana Terra Athayde meets one outside Congress .
Senate president Renan Calheiro has denied requests by Gleisi Hoffmann and Vanessa Grazziotin to delay the impeachment until the supreme court decides the presidentâ€ ™ s appeal over it .
On what could be the last morning of her presidency , Dilma Rousseff went for a stroll â€ ¦ with what appear to be rheas .
Jota notes that there are 56 senators currently holding the quorum , though there are 81 senators in all .
To impeach Rousseff her enemies need a simple majority of the senators present , not necessarily 41 needed with a full session .
Votingâ€ ™ s expected to begin this evening .
Vice - president Michel Temer , of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party , is waiting in the wings today to take over from Dilma Rousseff should she be impeached .
Rousseff has declared her running - mate and former ally a â€œusurperâ€ � , but his party is feeling good .
Theyâ€ ™ re calling today the â€œday of hopeâ€ � .
A year ago Temer was singing ( or at least tweeting ) a different tune :
â€œImpeachment is unthinkable , would create an institutional crisis .
There is no judicial or political basis for it.â€ �
Temer is not free of the scandals entangling his new and old allies .
He was fined last week for violating campaign finance limits , and although he can assume the presidency if Rousseff is ousted , he may be barred from running for office for years .
Senator Gleisi Hoffmann has asked the Senate president to postpone the vote on impeachment until the supreme court has decided on Rousseffâ€ ™ s appeal against the legality of the procedure .
Hoffmann was Rousseffâ€ ™ s chief of staff during her first term , from 2011 - 2014 .
The Senate session is finally underway , with the chamberâ€ ™ s president Renan Calheiro leading off with a long speech .
Thereâ€ ™ s a steady din of senators chattering behind him .
Portuguese speakers can follow along on Senate TV live here .
My colleague Jon Watts is in the room , with God himself , according to Calheiro .
The men and women of Brazilâ€ ™ s congress are a motley lot :
several of their leaders are themselves accused of corruption , including Senate president Renan Calheiro .
The Economist has compiled many of the strange reasons that federal deputies have given for their votes for and against impeachment so far , with translations .
For the foundations of Christianity For the Masons of Brazil For rural producers , because if they donâ€ ™ t plant there will be neither lunch nor dinner Because of the proposal that children can have sex - change procedures [ while still ] in school For my mother Lucimar
For charismatic renewal For the love of this country
For an end to the Petrobras scandal and those who profited from it For Campo Grande [ the state capital of Mato Grosso do Sul ] , the loveliest brunette of Brazil
For all the insurance brokers For peace in Jerusalem
For the sector that generates wealth : agribusiness For my son Breno and my beloved military police of SÃ£o Paulo
So that we donâ€ ™ t become Reds like in Venezuela and North Korea For my wife and my daughter , who are my principal electorate
In order that no government stands against the nation of Israel For my wife Mariana and daughter little Mariana For the truckers For free men and morality I forgot to mention my son .
For you , Paulo Henrique ! Kiss !
You can read the full list ( itself only a selection ) here .
Senate president Renana Calheiro is talking to the press in Brasilia , and said that the first session has already been delayed 45 minutes .
Live looks at the Senate show around half of the senators havenâ€ ™ t arrived on time for one of the most consequential votes in modern Brazilian history .
My colleagues Jon Watts and Ana Athayde are in Brasilia helping cover the vote , and have sent along a quick guide of what we can expect from the Senate today .
The Senate had been scheduled to begin at 9 am local time , but is already running late .
( Brasilia is an hour ahead of New York , and four behind London ) .
The first session was set to last until about noon local time .
The second session is scheduled for 1pm-6pm local , and a third session from 7pm - until the end of proceedings .
Each of the 81 senators will have 15 minutes to speak , meaning the session could , in theory , last over 20 hours .
The latest survey by Grupo Folha , one of Brazilâ€
™ s largest media companies , found that 50 senators are in favor of impeachment , 20 against it , and 11 undecided .
And Dilma Rousseff has cleared out her office , Reuters reports , though she has kept up public appearances and meetings as scheduled .
Recently asked about her plans , she said : â€œWhat else would I do ?
Stop governing ?
Iâ€ ™ m still president.â€

Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the impeachment of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff , who faces being forced out of office by an unruly Congress that has accused her of illegally manipulating government accounts .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s nemesis in the affair is Eduardo Cunha , the machiavellian speaker of the House who is himself accused of corruption and has been suspended from his post .
Similarly tangled up in the scandal are the former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva and his chief of staff ( allies of Rousseff ) , vice - president Michel Temer , who was last week fined for violating campaign law , and two more enemies of the president .
Senate president Renan Calheiros is being investigated in a bribery investigation involving Brazilâ€ ™ s state - run oil company , Petrobras , and opposition leader AÃ
© cio Neves has been criticzed for his familyâ€ ™ s secret bank account in Lichtenstein .
Itâ€ ™ s been chaotic .
Protesters have taken to the streets for and against Rousseff , and even the lawmakers whoâ€ ™ ve threatened her for months canâ€ ™ t seem to organize .
On Monday the acting speaker of the House annulled the impeachment vote , claiming irregularities in the process , and was promptly challenged by senior senators .
On Tuesday he changed his mind , clearing the way for an impeachment vote all over again .
At the center of the struggle is Rousseff herself , a former Marxist guerrilla who was jailed and tortured in the 1970s and who , only a year and a half ago , won re - election in one of the nationâ€ ™ s largest democracies .
Though she had managed to escape the corruption scandals that have plagued other lawmakers and her allies for years , a federal court last year said one of her economic measures in 2014 â€ “ taking loans from public banks to mask the economyâ€ ™ s troubles
â€ “ was illegal .
If a simple majority of the 81 senators vote to impeach â€ “ 41 is the magic number â€ “ Rousseff will be suspended for 180 days while Congress weighs whether to remove her from office for good .
If they do so , Temer will likely take over in her stead .
Rousseff has vowed to fight until the end , and dubbed him a â€œusurperâ€ � .
In the background of the political drama are very real woes .
Brazilâ€ ™ s economy is in its worst recession in a quarter of a century , low oil prices have deflated one of its most important exports , and there are huge inequalities of wealth .
The nation is also the epicenter of the Zika virus crisis , and set to host the hugely expensive Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro , a city as famous for its crime and favelas as its culture and beauty ."
2016-05-12,"There were no tears â€ “ at least not from Dilma Rousseff â€ “ as she left the Planalto presidential palace after an impeachment defeat that curtails 13 years of Workersâ€ ™ party rule in Brazil and may well end the political career of the countryâ€ ™ s first female president .
Surrounded by cabinet ministers and supporters , the former Marxist guerrilla came close to choking at one point as she made a final statement before being suspended from the highest office in Latin Americaâ€ ™ s biggest country .
â€œI may have committed mistakes , but I never committed crimes , â€ �
she said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the most brutal thing that can happen to a human being
â€ “ being condemned for a crime you didnâ€ ™ t commit .
No injustice is more devastating.â€
�
Although many of her allies were red - eyed , Rousseff struck a defiant tone , condemning the â€œtreacheryâ€ � of those who sabotaged her government , accusing her replacement vice - president Michel Temer of setting up an administration without a direct electoral mandate , and vowing to fight on against what she called a â€œcoupâ€ � .
Her chances of survival , however , have diminished enormously as a result of two crushing defeats in parliament .
After a marathon 20-hour overnight session on Wednesday and Thursday , the senate voted 55 - 22 to begin her impeachment trial .
This followed a similarly huge loss in congress last month .
Rousseff will now go on trial in the upper house for up to six months on charges of doctoring government accounts to make them look more healthy ahead of her re - election in 2014 .
The final vote â€ “ which requires a two - thirds majority of senators â€ “ could come as early as September .
The interim government will be led by Temer , who played a major role in nudging his running mate aside .
A constitutional lawyer from the Brazilian Democratic Movement party , the 75-year - old has spent the past few weeks putting together a new cabinet , which will represent a rightward tack of the government .
Although the new head of state has promised to maintain welfare programs such as the cash handout scheme known as bolsa familia , his priority will be to regain investor confidence by balancing the budget and getting inflation back under 10 % .
Underscoring the conservative timbre of the new cabinet , all the ministers are male and white .
Some of them are controversial appointments .
Conservationists are alarmed that the top agriculture post has been given to â€œsoya bean kingâ€ � Blairo Maggi , who has recently been promoting a constitutional amendment to remove environmental licensing on public projects .
Despite the ongoing Zika epidemic , Temer has appointed a politician with no medical background as the new health minister .
The portfolio will be taken by Ricardo Barros , a civil engineer by training from the Progressive party , which is notorious for corruption .
The health post is much in demand as it has the biggest budget of any ministry .
It is frequently used as a political bargaining card .
Barros is the fourth health minister in little more than half a year .
In a sign of his commitment to austerity , Temer has slashed the number of cabinet posts from 31 to 22 .
But he may find it hard to cut other costs ahead of municipal elections and with unemployment already in double digits .
Whether this tough task can be achieved will depend largely on new finance minister Henrique Meirelles , who was widely praised as central bank president under the first two Workersâ€ ™ party governments .
This time , however , he is likely to be charged with reining in expenses and encouraging other ministers to push ahead with privatisations , outsourcing and weakening labour laws .
AndrÃ © CÃ
© sar , a political consultant , said Temer would take a new approach to government , but the new president will not be able to enjoy a honeymoon because he will have have to cut costs while keeping a range of coalitions partners happy .
He is also likely to face protests on the streets from social movements .
â€œIn the very short term , turbulence will increaseâ€ � , he said .
â€œBut If he can manage to advance his agenda in the first couple of months , then he can take a breath .
The problem is coalition politics .
There are several parties and politicians with different world views.â€ �
And while the markets are likely to be happy , the public will need a lot of convincing .
Temerâ€ ™ s ratings are almost as low as those of the suspended president .
He has a disapproval rating of 62 % and support from fewer than one in seven voters , according to the most recent poll .
He and his cabinet are also tainted by corruption allegations .
Temer faces an impeachment challenge of his own , has been barred from standing for office for eight years due to election violations , and has been named in two plea bargains in the ongoing Lava Jato investigation into the kick - back and bribery scandal at the state - run oil firm Petrobras .
Several members of his proposed cabinet , including Romero JucÃ ¡
â€ “ the new planning secretary â€ “ also face charges by Lava Jato prosecutors .
By contrast , Rousseff faces no corruption allegations , though she is being forced to step aside while she is judged .
Polls suggest she will be missed by only a small minority , but several hundred came to give her a warm send - off .
As she walked from the palace to a waiting car , they chanted her name and cursed her enemies .
â€œFora Temerâ€ � ( Temer Out ) , they yelled .
â€œFascists and Coup Mongers will not prevail.â€ �
Many were clothed in the red of the Workersâ€ ™ party .
A few wore the feathered headdresses and body point of indigenous groups , who fear the new government will accelerate the erosion of their territory .
â€œDilma wasnâ€ ™ t perfect , but at least she gave us a voice , â€ � said Edinaldo ArÃ¡gun , a chief of the Tabajara people from Paraiba state .
â€œThe new government will be much worse .
They are criminals and thieves who will take our land , as people have been doing for hundreds of years.â€ �
The majority appeared to be women from social movements .
Edenilce Silva , a teacher from BrasÃ­lia , said she felt anger at those who voted for impeachment and appreciation for the outgoing president and Workers party .
â€œIâ€ ™ m indignant that my vote has not been respected , â€ � she said .
â€œDilma was my choice .
She fought against dictatorship and when she was president she put more priority on the rights of black people and women like me .
More importantly , she improved society as a whole .
Living standards are better .
There are more schools .
More opportunities to enter university.â€
�
â€œThis is not the end , â€ � said Silva , hopefully .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a pause.â€ �"
2016-05-12,"Less than halfway through her elected mandate , Dilma Rousseff was stripped of her presidential duties for up to six months on Thursday after the Senate voted to begin an impeachment trial .
After a marathon 20-hour debate that one politician described as the â€œsaddest day for Brazilâ€ ™ s young democracyâ€ � , senators voted 55 to 22 to suspend the Workersâ€ ™ party leader , putting economic problems , political paralysis and alleged fiscal irregularities ahead of the 54 m votes that put her in office .
Rousseff , Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president , will have to step aside while she is tried in the upper house for allegedly manipulating government accounts ahead of the previous election .
Her judges will be senators , many of whom are accused of more serious wrongdoing .
A final decision , which is likely in September or October , will require a two - thirds majority .
Ominously for the president , this margin was exceeded in Thursdayâ€ ™ s vote .
Speaking after the vote , Rousseff remained defiant , denying that she had committed any crime , and accusing her opponents of mounting a â€œcoupâ€ � .
â€œI may have committed errors but I never committed crimes , â€ � Rousseff said during a 14-minute address , at one point choking up .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the most brutal of things that can happen to a human being to be condemned for a crime you didnâ€ ™ t commit .
There is no more devastating injustice.â€
�
The impeachment is more political than legal .
Similar fiscal irregularities went unpunished in previous administrations , but they are a pretext to remove a leader who has struggled to assert her authority .
After Rousseff came to power in 2010 , she initially enjoyed some of the highest ratings of any leader in the world .
But her popularity has slumped along with the economy , now in its deepest recession for decades .
Adding to her woes have been a fractious parliament and a massive corruption scandal at the state - run oil firm , Petrobras , that has implicated politicians across the spectrum , including many close aides and the former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva .
With the Olympic spotlight now about to shine on Brazil â€
“ and the Zika virus health crisis
far from over â€ “
the country is fraught with problems .
Many blame the Workersâ€ ™ party , which has been in power for 13 years .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s
approval ratings are now around 10 % ; close to 60 % of voters support impeachment .
But many are uncomfortable about how she is being pushed aside .
Even many opponents acknowledge the president is one of the least corrupt politicians in Brazil .
On their way to the impeachment debate , senators walked through the long concrete corridors of the parliament building , which are decorated with timelines of epic moments in the history of the chamber : the abolition of slavery in 1888 ( the last major country in the world to do so ) , the creation of the First and Second Republics of 1889 - 1930 and 1946 - 1964 ( both of which ended in military coups ) , the return of democracy in 1988 and subsequent steps to improve the rights of workers , women and minorities .
Few taking part would claim the impeachment of the countryâ€ ™ s first woman president will be remembered with pride .
Unlike the triumphantly ugly scenes during the lower house vote which invited scorn around the world , most of the senators struck a sombre tone .
There was no repeat â€ “ at least in the early sessions â€ “ of the cheering and singing .
Instead , many claimed to be sad and said they were only reluctantly approving the suspension of the elected head of state because the economy was in crisis and politics were in turmoil .
â€œAll the people here are broken - hearted .
We donâ€ ™ t want this , but it is unavoidable .
Brazil has come to a stop since last year , â€ � claimed Marcelo Crivella , who , as well as being a senator for the Brazilian Republican party , is a gospel singer and a bishop of the evangelical Universal Church of the Kingdom of God .
â€œWe all recognise that [ Dilma ] has done a good job during her life for the democracy of Brazil.â€ �
Despite these respectful words , Crivella â€ “ who was once allied with the Workersâ€ ™ party government â€ “ said that he would vote for the impeachment of the president because the country is mired in crisis and needs a change of economic policy .
Others cited problems of corruption , which have led to the arrests of dozens of politicians across the political spectrum .
RomÃ¡rio , the former striker for the national football team , looked somewhat ill at ease as he declared his vote for impeachment .
â€œI know some will disagree , â€ � he said .
â€œBut I have concluded there is sufficient evidence to admit the process.â€ �
He warned , however , that removing the president would not work like a magic wand to lift Brazil out of the mire .
For the Workersâ€ ™ party and its supporters , however , this was a day of shame for Brazilâ€ ™ s political class .
While many acknowledge the shortcomings of a president who never appeared comfortable dealing with congress or communicating with the nation , they claim Rousseff is the victim of a â€œcoupâ€ � by the old elite who were unable to accept the result of the last election and deliberately caused instability to grab power .
â€œThis is the saddest day in the history of our young democracy , â€ � said Vanessa Grazziotin , a senator from the Communist Party of Brazil .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t a valid constitutional process , it is a coup that goes against the opinion of the majority in the 2014 election.â€ �
However , the senator said the battle was not over because there was still time over the coming months for the population to realise they were robbed of their rights by the removal of the president .
â€œIf they suspend her today ,
Iâ€ ™ ll go to the streets to demand new elections ,
â€ � Grazziotin said .
Seventy percent of Brazilians support holding new elections â€ “ an even bigger majority than those who favoured impeachment â€
“
but that has been ruled out by Vice - President Michel Temer , who has now maneuvered to replace his running mate .
He has spent the past few weeks canvassing candidates for the centre - right administration he is now expected to form .
Advance lists of ministerial posts in the domestic media suggest his first cabinet will be entirely male and overwhelmingly white .
It is unlikely to be more popular â€ “ nor any less tainted by corruption .
Temerâ€ ™ s ratings are almost as low as those of the outgoing president .
According to the most recent opinion survey by Ipsos , he has a disapproval rating of 62 % .
Fewer than one in seven support him .
He too faces an impeachment process , though his support in parliament makes it unlikely he will succumb .
And he too has been implicated in two plea bargains in the ongoing Lava Jato investigation into the kick - back and bribery scandal at the state - run oil firm Petrobras .
Several members of his proposed cabinet also face charges by prosecutors .
Senator after senator repeated the phrase that â€œnobody is above the lawâ€ � , yet many are living proof that this has long been untrue in Brazilian politics .
As in the lower house many of the politicians who voted for Rousseff to be stripped of her post for fiscal irregularities are themselves accused of far greater crimes .
Thirty - three of the 81 senators have either been charged or are under investigation by prosecutors .
Some have been found guilty by the supreme court , such as Ivo Cassol , a senator from RondÃ´nia , who is fighting a five - year prison sentence for fraud and has been fined for illegal deforestation of the Amazon .
Among those who spoke was Fernando Collor , who was the last president to be impeached in 1992 , and is now implicated in the Lava Jato case .
He did not say how he would vote , but spent much of his time at the microphone claiming he was wrongly accused .
The implications for Brazilâ€ ™ s democracy are , at best , mixed .
Of the four directly elected presidents since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985 , two have now been impeached .
The upper echelons of the political class are also deeply tainted by scandal and scheming .
Four of the five top figures in the nation are now either suspended or under investigation by prosecutors .
The third in line to the presidency â€ “ house speaker Eduardo Cunha , who orchestrated Rousseffâ€ ™
s
downfall
â€ “ was suspended from his post by the supreme court for obstructing justice .
Prosecutors in the Lava Jato investigation have also accused Cunha of receiving at least $ 5 m in bribes and hiding the money in secret Swiss bank accounts .
The fourth in line , Renan Calheiros , the leader of the senate who oversaw todayâ€ ™ s impeachment vote , is the subject of 11 criminal investigations , nine of which are related to Lava Jato .
Rousseff spent her last day in power largely out of the public eye .
Instead of her usual morning bicycle ride , she went for a walk .
Later , she fired all but two members of her cabinet â€ “ the head of the central bank and the sports minister , who has played a central role in organising the Olympics .
Now suspended , the president is unlikely to attend the opening ceremony of the Games as she had previously been expected to do .
She could yet come back , but the chances are slim now that Temer controls the budget and more than 10,000 government appointments .
There is little ceremony for the handover of power .
The senate will send an emissary with an intimaÃ§Ã£o or official notification of the result and its consequences to President Rousseff , who will keep her title and residence , but lose her authority and be obliged to leave the Planalto presidential office .
The same emissary will then deliver a notificaÃ§Ã£o to Michel Temer that he must assume the duties of the head of state .
Vicentinho Alves , the senator who will serve the role of emissary , said he will carry out his duties respectfully .
â€œI see Dilma as an upright and honest person who lacked the ability to govern in this situation , â€ � he said .
â€œIn democracy , as I see it , a leader needs to have the support of the streets , which the president currently lacks .
If that is gone , then you need the support of the national congress .
But that is also gone .
When you lose both those elements , you lose the capacity to govern.â€ �
Whether Temer will find it any easier remains to be seen .
Given the circumstances under which he took power his administration starts under a cloud .
Workersâ€ ™ party supporters have vowed to mobilise against him .
During the senate vote , thousands took to the streets of major cities to protest .
Outside the congress building in BrasÃ­lia there were minor confrontations as police fired teargas and pepper spray at demonstrators who threw rocks and fireworks .
â€œThe police are very violent .
The majority of them are against Dilma and democracy , â€ � said Clair Helena Santos , a housing activist from SÃ£o Paulo , spluttering as she struggled to catch her breath .
â€œWith her out of power , things are going to get worse for social movements .
But we will reorganise , continue our struggle and build a strong new left .
It might not be called the Workersâ€ ™ party .
But we will have Lula as our candidate in 2018.â€ �
On the other side of the esplanade , several hundred pro - impeachment supporters were celebrating with music , dancing and drinking .
Many were draped in the yellow and green national flag .
â€œIâ€ ™ m totally delighted .
The Workersâ€ ™ party is finally gone , â€ � said Rafael Curvo , a lawyer from SÃ£o Paulo .
â€œFor us
this is like the start of a new year.â€

The distance between the party and the street scuffles was little more than a hundred metres , but the two sides were separated by police and a metal barrier that has been dubbed the â€œimpeachment wallâ€ � .
It will come down soon .
Temer may find it harder to reunify the nation ."
2016-05-12,"Brazilâ€ ™ s Rousseff impeached Brazilâ€ ™ s senate has voted to impeach Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president , Dilma Rousseff , stripping her of her duties halfway through her second term in the countryâ€ ™ s first impeachment in 24 years .
Rousseff will be suspended for at least six months and will face trial for allegedly manipulating government accounts .
Her jurors will be senators , many of whom are accused of more serious crimes .

Zimmerman said he has already received offers for â€œthe firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martinâ€ � but â€œthe offers were to use the gun in a fashion I did not feel comfortable withâ€
� .
The former neighborhood watch volunteer was acquitted two years ago in the death of the young African American , but the case sparked protests and a national debate about race relations .

Trumpâ€ ™ s rise puts moderate Republicans in a tough spot Saudi â€˜supportâ€ ™ for 9/11 in missing pages
A former Republican member of the 9/11 commission has broken with the commissionâ€ ™ s leaders , saying he believes there was clear evidence that Saudi government employees were part of a support network for the 9/11 hijackers .
The comments by John H Lehman , a New York investment banker who was navy secretary in the Reagan administration , is the first clear split among the 10 commissioners who approved the 2004 final report .
The 28 â€œmissing pagesâ€ � from the report should now be declassified , Lehman says .

The Nevada test , in which a sled accelerated to 116 mph ( 187kph ) in 1.1 seconds , represents a very early proof of concept ; there are a vast number of hurdles that the developers of Hyperloop still have to clear if the technology is to become a reality .
If and when completed , the Hyperloop would work by propelling pods at high speeds through a tube , which in theory would be able to make the journey from San Francisco to Los Angeles in just 30 minutes .

On the eve of a major anti - corruption summit , columnist Jeffrey Sachs argues that if the US and UK are serious about clamping down on tax havens and corruption they need to start the process at home .
â€œThe fight against corruption entails no small amount of absurdity , since so much of the corruption these days occurs in broad daylight .
The corruption is so blatant , so indefensible , that attempts at justification are necessarily surreal.â€ � Jeffrey Sachs :
To end corruption , start with the US and UK .
They allow it in broad daylight Understanding
Facebookâ€ ™ s news bias
Silicon Valley tech giants may be trying to make their newsfeeds free of bias , but that is a difficult undertaking , writes Danny Yadron .
Journalists are more complicated than algorithms , and companies like Facebook , Twitter , Snapchat and Google have moved outside their comfort zone by trying to curate â€œunbiasedâ€ � news .
â€œThe issue for technology companies , which seek to get just as many millions of conservatives as liberals to use their products , is that curating the news carries political judgments that selling smartphones and promoting apps donâ€ ™ t.â€ �

The headline of this article was amended on 12 May 2016 to clarify that Dilma Rousseff has been suspended ; she has not yet been impeached ."
2016-05-13,"The impeachment of Dilma Rousseff is a sad day for democracy and can be seen as a tragedy for Brazilâ€ ™ s struggling path towards further democratisation .
But it also signals a new beginning , a possibility for the renewal of hope .
Brazil , like other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Chile , still has a long way to go before it can become an advanced stable democracy , where pluralism and diversity in the media and in the political public sphere is encouraged and celebrated , and not undermined .
A place where the intellectual zeitgeist is one of equal opportunities , social inclusion and fair play .
Rousseff has been a victim of her own mistakes in the economy , currently engulfed in a deep recession , and her inability to deal politically with allies and with a hostile , aggressive and conservative opposition .
But she has also fallen foul of a process that is being seen as extremely controversial and hypocritical â€ “ for many a form of â€œsoft coupâ€ � â€ “ led by politicians who themselves have been accused of corruption .
The exaggerated claims of the demise of Latin Americaâ€ ™ s leftwing parties have been an easy , and lazy , attempt to dismiss the political forces that struggle for more justice and more democracy .
There have , of course , been setbacks across the continent , from Argentina to Guatemala and Venezuela .
The history of Latin American populism is a long one , but the fact of the matter is that leftwing parties on the continent have had a mixed bag of success and failure , and are all very different from each other .
Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva and Michelle Bachelet , from Brazil and Chile respectively , chose to adopt a New Labour - style form of social democracy in contrast to other more populist parties of the region .
The setbacks have occurred because of their failure to conduct political reform or to respond to the corrupt practices of some of their own members , while simultaneously creating the means to grant more autonomy to federal policy and the justice system in their fight against corruption .
Latin America is considered one of most unequal regions in the world , and grew more so during the 1990s .
It was only with Lulaâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ party ( PT ) that a truer vision for a more just and equal country â€ “ which offered opportunities and inclusion for the poor from the north - east , the indigenous populations , African - Brazilians and less privileged women â€ “ was actually articulated .
This crisis can only be understood by looking at Brazilâ€ ™ s history of authoritarianism , social inequality and exclusion of the poor by elites who , with exceptions , have traditionally been hostile to any form of social change .
Brazil needs deep structural reforms , from agriculture to politics and taxation .
Currently 70 % of taxes are charged on consumption , and only 30 % on property .
Privatisation of a few state companies and deeper cuts in public spending will not solve the countryâ€ ™ s serious problems .
At the moment the country is deeply divided , with many having jumped on the impeachment bandwagon due to frustrations with the corruption scandal , the recession and growing unemployment , not to mention the strong influence of the mainstream media and other conservative sectors in shaping public opinion against the PT and Rousseff .
Growing disillusionment towards Brazilâ€ ™ s institutions and their commitment to democracy has also expanded significantly , spreading even to how people view the supreme court , until recently seen as a bastion for upholding the values and articles of the 1988 Brazilian constitution .
It is not just a simple matter of the left adapting and learning from its mistakes â€ “ although it should , of course .
The left still has a big role to play across Latin America by focusing on combining market dynamics with the pillars of social democracy .
After ignoring the importance of dealing with inequality for many years , the rightwing opposition has started to take these concerns on board , with interim president Michel Temer even stating that his new government would not cancel programmes such as the Bolsa Familia , which has lifted millions out of poverty and was praised by the World Bank .
The right has as much to learn from its mistakes as the left .
It must stop assuming the moral high ground and work harder to adapt to social change and the new demands of the Brazilian population .
This means the right must rid itself of its nasty authoritarian practices and mindset , follow in the footsteps of modern conservative parties , and leave behind its fusty , old - fashioned views ."
2016-05-13,"Brazilâ€ ™ s interim president , Michel Temer , has unveiled an all - male , conspicuously white cabinet to run one of the worldâ€ ™ s most ethnically diverse nations as he promised to restore confidence in Latin Americaâ€ ™ s biggest economy .
Following the suspension of Dilma Rousseff , the countryâ€ ™ s first female president , the new head of state called for unity and said his primary task was to form a government of â€œnational salvationâ€ � that could restore Brazilâ€ ™ s credibility so it could attract investment .
â€œTrust me
, â€ � he said in his inaugural speech at the Planalto presidential palace .
â€œTrust the values of our people and our ability to recuperate the economy.â€ �
His message came a few hours after he was accused of treachery by his former running mate Rousseff , who claimed she was forced out of office by â€œsabotageâ€ � , â€œopen conspiracyâ€ � and a â€œcoupâ€
� .
The sharply contrasting statements highlight the rancorousness of an impeachment battle that has curtailed 13 years of Workersâ€ ™ party rule and divided the nation .
Rousseff was stripped of her powers on Thursday after losing a preliminary impeachment vote in the Senate .
This followed a similar crushing defeat in the Congress in April .
She now faces trial by the Senate on charges of doctoring government accounts to give an unrealistically healthy impression ahead of the 2014 election .
Temer â€ “ a senior figure in the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement party
â€ “ was elected on Rousseffâ€ ™ s coat - tails in 2014 , but recently abandoned his former government partner on the grounds that the country needed new leadership to get out of its deepest recession in decades .
The economy was the focus of his first speech .
â€œIt is essential to rebuild the credibility of the country abroad to attract new investments and get the economy growing again , â€ � he said .
Adding fuelling to claims of betrayal , the 75-year - old constitutional lawyer had spent the past few weeks putting together the centre - right administration that he unveiled on Thursday .
Although he promised to maintain welfare programmes such as bolsa familia poverty relief , he has touted balancing the budget and getting inflation back under 10 % as his priority .
In a sign of his commitment to austerity , Temer has slashed the number of cabinet posts from 31 to 22 .
But he may find it hard to cut other costs ahead of municipal elections and with unemployment already in double digits .
Whether this tough task can be achieved will depend largely on new finance minister Henrique Meirelles , who gained considerable kudos as central bank president under the first two Workersâ€ ™ party governments .
He will be charged with reining in expenses and encouraging other ministers to push ahead with privatisation , outsourcing and weakening stringent labour and pension laws .
Several appointments were controversial .
Conservationists are alarmed that the top agriculture post has been given to â€œsoyabean kingâ€ � Blairo Maggi , who has recently been promoting a constitutional amendment to remove environmental licensing on public projects .
Despite the Zika epidemic , the new health minister , Ricardo Barros from the Progressive party , has no background in medicine .
He becomes the fourth in little over six months to hold a portfolio which is much coveted because it has the biggest budget of any ministry .
While the markets are likely to be happy , the public will need a lot of convincing .
Temerâ€ ™ s ratings are almost as low as those of the suspended president .
He has a disapproval rating of 62 % and support from fewer than one in seven voters , according to the most recent poll .
Temer and his cabinet are also tainted by corruption allegations .
The interim president himself faces an impeachment challenge and has been barred from standing for office for eight years due to election violations .
He has also been named in two plea bargains in the ongoing Lava Jato investigation into the kickback and bribery scandal at the state - run oil firm Petrobras .
Half a dozen other members of his proposed cabinet , including new planning secretary Romero JucÃ ¡ , also face charges by Lava Jato prosecutors .
Despite these problems Temer said he had â€œabsolute confidenceâ€ � in his ability to turn things around with the help of the population .
â€œIt is urgent to restore peace and unite Brazil .
We must form a government that will save the nation , â€ �
he said .
As he spoke there were minor scuffles outside the building , where several dozen anti - Temer protesters staged a lie - in .
They were ejected by security guards with beatings and pepper spray .
Unity also appeared far from the mind of his predecessor , who has vowed to fight against her removal from office .
â€œI may have committed mistakes but I never committed crimes , â€ � Rousseff said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the most brutal thing that can happen to a human being
â€ ” being condemned for a crime you didnâ€ ™ t commit .
No injustice is more devastating.â€
�
Rousseff has only a slim chance of avoiding permanent removal from office .
The final Senate vote â€ “ which requires a two - thirds majority â€ “ could come by September .
AndrÃ © CÃ
© sar , a political consultant , said the new president will not be able to enjoy a honeymoon because he has to cut costs while keeping a range of political partners happy , in addition to the likely protest on the streets from social movements .
â€œIn the very short term , turbulence will increase , â€ �
he said .
â€œBut if he can manage to advance his agenda in the first couple of months , then he can take a breath .
The problem is coalition politics .
There are several parties and politicians with different world views.â€ � Mauro Rochlin , an economist at the right - leaning GetÃºlio Vargas Foundation , praised Temerâ€ ™ s economic team but said he would need support from Congress to push ahead with the necessary policies .
â€œAll the things that he needs to cut are in very sensitive , essential areas .
There is no other way around it .
It will be up to Congress to make important changes in spending policies .
They will have to allow changes in public salaries and retirement , but the public sector is very sensitive and very mobilised.â€ �
Leda Maria Paulani , a leftwing economist at the University of SÃ£o Paulo who considers the new government to be illegitimate , acknowledged there may be an initial boost to GDP because the business community had got what it wanted .
But she warned that the long - term impact would be a rolling back of hard - won benefits for poor sectors of society , particularly if the government pushed austerity .
â€œThis will have terrible results in terms of the rates of growth , unemployment and everything that goes along with a recession , â€ �
she said ."
2016-05-13,"Brazilâ€ ™ s image as a socially liberal , multi - ethnic democracy may always have been more myth than reality , but any lingering illusions of this type have been swept away by interim president Michel Temerâ€ ™ s appointment of the countryâ€ ™ s first all - male cabinet since the end of dictatorship in1985 .
After conspiring to suspend Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president , his former running mate Dilma Rousseff , the 75-year - old patrician quickly showed his conservative instincts with a mostly white lineup of ministers that also included a soy baron in charge of agriculture , and a finance minister who immediately declared the need for sweeping cuts .
As was evident by the scrum of white men in suits who surrounded the grinning leader during his inauguration speech , Brazilâ€ ™ s old elite are once again at the helm â€ “ and they feel little obligation to represent the 52 % of the population who are women or the 53 % who are of mixed race .
It was a stunning contrast to Rousseffâ€ ™ s departing cabinet and government team , which was far more diverse in gender and race .
Temer made no apologies for harking back to traditional values .
Just as many impeachment protesters have wrapped themselves in the national colours , he declared the motto of his new government would be â€œorder and progressâ€ �
â€ “
the Positivist slogan that spans the countryâ€ ™ s flag .
Progress , however , does not appear to include improvements in the rights of women , who were long treated as second - class citizens in this macho culture .
A recent cover story , Veja magazine â€ “ the mouthpiece of the conservative right â€ “ paid tribute to such ideals , describing Temerâ€ ™ s wife , Marcela â€ “ a beauty pageant contestant who is 43 his junior â€ “ as â€œBela , recatada e do
larâ€ � ( Beautiful , demure and homely ) .
In the interview inside , the first lady â€ “ who has her husbandâ€ ™ s name tattooed on the back of her neck
â€ “ said she felt lucky that he still found time to take her out for dinner every couple of weeks .
Rousseff â€ “ a former Marxist guerrilla who was once arrested with a gun in her handbag and withstood torture during the military dictatorship , yet went on to lead Latin Americaâ€ ™ s
most powerful country â€ “ was the antithesis of the rightâ€ ™ s vision of femininity .
In her parting address , Rousseff said she was the victim of treachery and misogyny .
During the rowdy lower house impeachment vote , many conservative congressmen and their wives and girlfriends posed with patronising placards reading â€œTchau queridaâ€ �
( Bye bye darling ) .
Ultra - conservative lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro went a step further by dedicating his vote to the dictatorship - era torturer - in - chief Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra , who he described sadistically as â€œthe dread of Dilmaâ€ � .
Despite condemnation from the left for this comment , Bolsonaro has not been punished .
Among the right , he has surged in popularity , adding more than half a million Facebook â€œlikesâ€ � in the two weeks that followed .
Rousseff was stripped of her powers on Thursday after losing a preliminary impeachment vote in the Senate .
This followed a similar crushing defeat in the congress in April .
She now faces trial by the senate on charges of doctoring government accounts to give an unrealistically healthy impression ahead of the 2014 election .
She now has only a slim chance of avoiding permanent removal from office .
The final senate vote â€ “ which requires a two - thirds majority â€ “ could come by September .
Many of her accusers , however , are under investigation for far more serious crimes .
Temer faces an impeachment challenge and has been barred from standing for office for eight years due to election violations .
He has also been named in two plea bargains in the ongoing Lava Jato investigation into the kickback and bribery scandal at the state - run oil firm , Petrobras .
Half a dozen other members of his proposed cabinet , including new planning secretary Romero JucÃ ¡ , also face charges by Lava Jato prosecutors .
Despite these problems , Temer said he had â€œabsolute confidenceâ€ � in his ability to turn things around with the help of the population .
â€œIt is urgent to restore peace and unite Brazil .
We must form a government that will save the nation , â€ �
he said .
As he spoke there were minor scuffles outside the building , where several dozen anti - Temer protesters staged a lie - in .
They were ejected by security guards with beatings and pepper spray .
Many doubt an all - male , predominantly white government can unite one of the worldâ€ ™ s most ethnically diverse nations , particularly given its primary focus will be to cut government spending so attract foreign investment .
Ana Claudia Farranha , the only black female professor in her department at the University of Brasilia , said Temerâ€ ™ s cabinet showed how far removed he was from the population , which will be a course of weakness .
â€œThis feels like we are taking a step backwards , â€ �
she said .
â€œThey say they want to build a â€˜bridge to the futureâ€ ™ , but itâ€ ™ s not a coalition with society .
Itâ€ ™ s a hegemonic faction inside a political bloc .
This arrangement gives his government a lot of fragility.â€ �
It has certainly resulted in a great deal of mockery .
Beyond the conservative right , the other Brazil â€ “ which aims to be more inclusive and egalitarian â€ “ has responded with indignation and bitter humour .
Among the many scathing online memes and comments was one by â€ � @andretrig who noted in Portuguese : â€œOrder and Progress without women or blacks as the first step .
The Temer government begins with a lot of testosterone and little pigment.â€ � Indigenous groups , who have suffered under every government for more than 500 years , say the difference is one of degree .
â€œDilma wasnâ€ ™ t perfect , but at least she gave us a voice , â€ � said Edinaldo ArÃ¡gun , a chief of the Tabajara people from Paraiba state , who joined the farewell rally for Rousseff .
â€œThe new government will be much worse .
They are criminals and thieves who will take our land , as people have been doing for hundreds of years.â€ �"

2016-05-13,"The suspension of Dilma Rousseff , Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president , and the new , all - male , conspicuously white cabinet that will run one of the worldâ€ ™ s most ethnically diverse nations under interim president , Michel Temer , is an unwelcome reminder of the fact that getting more diversity into government continues to be an uphill struggle .
Itâ€ ™ s why we still need organisations such as Women in Parliaments , the Brussels - based network that campaigns for more women in politics around the world .
In contrast to the look of the new Brazilian cabinet , there was a great moment last week when 260 female MPs took their seats under the dome of Jordanâ€ ™ s parliament building for the WIP global summit â€ “ a conference for female and some male parliamentarians to get together and discuss how to increase the number and the influence of women in parliaments all around the world .
These are the women , from New Zealand , Mexico , Jordan , the UK , Germany , Romania , Rwanda and more than 50 other countries , who make a difference in politics in their own countries , despite the fact that 80 % of public policy - makers and 90 % of world political leaders are men .
And they know it : this is the 5th WIP summit since the organisation was set up in 2013 and there is always an astonishing moment when the women take their seats and everyone looks round and realises , yes , this parliament is now full of women .
Itâ€ ™ s almost an audible intake of breath â€ “ and a rush to take photos .
Women are still woefully under - represented in parliamentary seats , holding only 22 % of seats in the worldâ€ ™ s governments .
Meetings like the one in Jordan serve a pragmatic purpose , identifying practical measures to dismantle barriers holding up further progress and gathering evidence on the influence of women in powerful positions .
It was also a significant move to hold the meeting in a Middle - Eastern country , not without controversy : a vote by the Jordan parliament to deny Israeli female parliamentarians access to the chamber , while in no way a decision by WIP itself , highlighted the problems of holding a non - political meeting for politicians in a region riven by dispute .
Nonetheless , holding the meeting in Jordan sent a powerful message about the progress of female parliamentarians and about womenâ€ ™ s rights more widely in the Middle East and North Africa .
A keynote speech came from the speaker of the UAE parliament , Amal Al Qubaisi , who was elected as the first female speaker of the Federal National Council in November 2015 .
WIP chair Hanna Birna KristjÃ¡nsdÃ³ttir , an Icelandic MP and former mayor of Reykjavik , told the UKâ€ ™ s
Womanâ€ ™ s
Hour on 9 May
that although Arab women have one of the lowest representations in parliaments worldwide , there has been a steady increase in womenâ€ ™ s participation to 18 % of seats .
â€œIt is not enough , not fast enough , but there are positive trends out there , â€ �
she said .
Organisation such as WIP , said Birna KristjÃ¡nsdÃ³ttir , work not only getting more women into power , but also work to increase their influence on legislation .
â€œThere is a critical mass for womenâ€ ™ s voices to be heard and get the issues women care about onto the table , â€ � she said .
Birna KristjÃ¡nsdÃ³ttir also noted that Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign to get the Democrat nomination and her bid to become the first female US president is based on policies , both worldwide and domestically , aligned with women in power and womenâ€ ™ s wellbeing .
Pauline Latham , a British MP attending a WIP summit for the first time , summed up her feelings , when she said , at the closing session of the conference , how impressed she had been by the speakers and participants .
â€œIf only there were more parliamentarians like the ones in this room we really could rule the world ,
â€ � she said .

2016-05-17,"The cast and crew of Aquarius , an acclaimed Brazilian drama in competition at Cannes have used the filmâ€ ™ s official premiere to mount a protest as what they see as a coup in their country .
Writer - director Kleber Mendonca Filho , along with his cast and crew , climbed the steps to the Palais in Cannes before revealing a selection of banners apparently objecting to the recent impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff .
The protest was met by ecstatic applause inside the cinema .
Audience members then joined in by holding aloft similar banners .
Aquarius is about an ageing music critic , played by Sonia Braga , eager to remain in her apartment despite developer pressure .
Yet it is not an overtly political film , instead meditating on shifting familial allegiances and the way space intersects with identity .
The film was made before the current political crisis in Brazil , which has seen the countryâ€ ™ s first female president forced from office , protesting her innocence about the crimes of which she has been accused .
In an interview with the New York Times last week , Mendonca Filho â€ “ whose own feelings about the countryâ€ ™ s democracy are said to be â€œferventâ€ �
â€ “ was asked if his film was intended to reflect the countryâ€ ™
s push for capitalist progress .
â€œGood films or books pick up on things in society , or in a country , but it is too early to say if this film does that before the film actually screens and people react to it , â€ � he said .
â€œOnly then
will I know .
I am curious myself.â€ �"
2016-05-18,"â€œBrazil is divided , â€ � declared writer - director Kleber MendonÃ§a Filho at the Cannes film festival on Wednesday , where his new film , Aquarius , is competing for the Palme dâ€ ™
Or .
His comments , made to the Guardian at a press conference for the drama on Wednesday , come a day after the filmâ€ ™ s premiere , where the cast and crew used the opportunity to mount a protest against what they describe as a coup .
Filho and his team are angered about the the recent impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff , the countryâ€ ™ s first female president , who was forced from office , as well as interim president Michel Temerâ€ ™ s controversial decision to abolish Brazilâ€ ™ s culture ministry .
Temer has since sought to tamp down the criticism by appointing a culture secretary , but four potential candidates have reported refusing the job .
â€œThey picked the wrong month to extinguish the ministry of culture , because a movie made with very public funds is currently competing in Cannes , â€ � Filho said .
The film - maker added that the â€œdramatic divideâ€ � Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment has brought to Brazil is
â€œterribleâ€ � .
â€œItâ€

â€œPeople in congress saying women shouldnâ€ ™ t work because they get pregnant - shocking ideas like that.â€ �
â€œAll this transition is going to be very hurtful for our democracy â€ “
that was hard to get in the first place , â€ � added Sonia Braga , Aquariusâ€ ™ lead actor .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not easy to lose.â€ �
The film features Braga as a fiercely resilient aging music critic eager to remain in her apartment despite developersâ€ ™ pressure .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Peter Bradshaw called it a â€œa densely observed and superbly acted portrait of a woman of a certain age.â€ � â€œIt was very important to take this international platform here to expose whatâ€ ™ s happening in Brazil , â€ �
Braga said of the red - carpet protest , echoing what Filho said .
â€œBecause of the biased media [ in Brazil ] , and because of what people are feeling , Brazil is divided.â€ �
Filho said the demonstration came together following discussions with fellow Brazilian film - makers and producers at the festival .
â€œWe liked the idea of doing something , â€ � he said .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t want to do something noisy , or something that would be in some way inadequate .
So the idea that we decided to go for was : A4 pieces of paper with really short sentences , which expressed what is happening in Brazil .
Cannes has many cameras and powerful long lenses , and it worked very beautifully.â€ � Banners , held by cast and crew on the steps of the Palais , and inside the theater by audience members , bore messages such as â€œBrazil is not a democracyâ€ � and â€œThe world can not accept this illegitimate governmentâ€ � .
The overtly political act was met with loud applause inside the venue .
Asked if the seaside town Recife in north - east Brazil , where Aquarius takes place , was meant to come across as a crumbling location , Filho said heâ€ ™ s â€œnot into apocalyptic portraits.â€ �
Said the film - maker :
â€œI think when youâ€ ™ re critical of something , you also have to show its normality and beauty in some way .
The city is where I live .
Itâ€ ™ s far from perfect , but so is Paris.â€ �"
2016-05-23,"The credibility of Brazilâ€ ™ s interim government was rocked on Monday when a senior minister was forced to step aside amid further revelations about the machiavellian plot to impeach president Dilma Rousseff .
Just 10 days after taking office , the planning minister , Romero JucÃ ¡ , announced that he would â€œgo on leaveâ€ � following the release of a secretly taped telephone conversation in which he said Rousseff needed to be removed to quash a vast corruption investigation that implicated him and other members of the countryâ€ ™ s political elite .
It is unlikely to be the last blow for the interim president , Michel Temer , whose centre - right cabinet includes seven ministers implicated by the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into kickbacks and money laundering at the state - run oil company Petrobras .
Temer took power earlier this month after the senate initiated an impeachment trial of Rousseff , who is suspended for up to six months pending the upper houseâ€ ™ s verdict on allegations that she manipulated government accounts before the last election .
Supporters of the Workersâ€ ™ party leader say the charges are a pretext for a â€œcoupâ€ � .
Temerâ€ ™ s allies counter that the impeachment was constitutional and necessary to address political paralysis and the worst recession in decades .
But the dubious motives and machiavellian nature of the plot to remove Rousseff are apparent in the transcript of a phone conversation between JucÃ ¡
â€ “ a powerful ally of Temerâ€ ™
s in the Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) â€
“ and SÃ
© rgio Machado , a former senator who until recently was the president of another state oil company , Transpetro .
After discussing how they are both targeted by Lava Jato prosecutors , JucÃ ¡ says the way out is political : â€œWe have to stop this shit ,
â€ �
he says of the investigation .
â€œWe have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding.â€ �
Machado concurs : â€œThe easiest solution would be to put in Michel
[ Temer].â€
�
The conversation took place just weeks before the lower house voted to impeach Rousseff , according to the Folha de SÃ£o Paulo newspaper , which published the transcript .
At one point , JucÃ ¡ appears to mock the Lava Jato investigators for their high - mindedness and determination to tackle all corrupt senators and congressmen .
â€œ[They want to ] put an end to this political class
so [ a new one ] can rise , to build a new breed
[ that will be ]
pure.â€ �
He then says the â€œpenny has droppedâ€ � on this threat not just for him , but for the leaders of the Social Democratic party , such as former presidential candidate AÃ © cio Neves , Senator Aloysio Neves , JosÃ © Serra and Tasso Jereissati â€ “ all of whom are now either in the cabinet of the interim government or key supporters of the coalition .
Later in the conversation , Juca says he talked about his plans to supreme court justices , who told him the â€œshitâ€ � ( referring to the corruption investigation and its media coverage ) would never stop as long as Rousseff remained in power .
He also said he received â€œguaranteesâ€ � from military commanders that they could prevent disturbances from radical leftwing groups such as the Landless Workers Movement .
JucÃ ¡
â€ “ who took the influential post of planning minister in the interim government
â€ “ admitted on Monday that the conversation had taken place , but he said his words were taken out of context .
He argued that he was referring to economic losses when he talked about â€œthe bleedingâ€ � .
His lawyer , Almeida Castro , reiterated this : â€œAt no time was JucÃ ¡ speaking against Lava Jato or seeking to interfere with the operation.â€ � But Machado , who was the source of the recording , is already reportedly negotiating a plea bargain with prosecutors .
According to reports in local media , JucÃ ¡ has said he will stay on leave until prosecutors decide whether he has committed any crime .
During the Lava Jato investigation , JucÃ ¡ was named in a plea bargain by former senator DelcÃ­dio Amaral as a beneficiary in a 30 m reais ( Â£5.7 m ) kickback scheme from inflated contracts for the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon .
He has denied the charges , which are being considered by the supreme court .
The Workersâ€ ™ party has also been deeply implicated in this and other wrongdoing , though Rousseff â€ “ who has not been charged with any crimes â€ “ allowed the Lava Jato investigation to continue while she was in charge .
Temer has insisted that he too would not interfere .
But many fear his new justice minister , Alexandre de Moraes , will reduce the scope of federal police activities .
Moraes has previously been a defence lawyer for Eduardo Cunha , the suspended lower house speaker who is a chief target of Lava Jato investigators .
In an interview with the Guardian last month , JucÃ ¡ denied that he , Cunha , Temer and other members of the PMDB were planning to rein back the Lava Jato investigation for the sake of stability .
â€œOn
the contrary , I think itâ€ ™ s necessary to accelerate Lava Jato , â€ � he said .
â€œYou need to separate the wheat from the chaff , separate the guilty from the innocent .
Political stability will be created by the innocent and by the credibility of politics for society .
Today , credibility is low and the level of representability of politicians and parties is very low .
We have to recover politics , which is an instrument to diminish conflicts and set a direction for the country.â€ �
But the interim administration he helped to create has shown little sign of reducing tension or restoring credibility .
The all - male , all - white cabinet has been heavily criticised as unrepresentative of the country , its austerity policies are unpopular and its leader has already backed down on removing the ministerial status of the culture ministry in the face of protests by leading artists , musicians and film - makers ."
2016-05-26,"We condemn the suspension of President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil .
It is thoroughly wrong that a few parliamentarians trample upon the political will expressed at the ballot box by 54 million Brazilians .
The new government has shown its true colours by appointing a non - representative , all - male , cabinet and launching neoliberal policies that will hurt millions of working and poorer people .
The interim government has no mandate to implement policies that reverse the social programmes that took 40 million people out of poverty .
We join Brazilâ€ ™ s progressive political and social movements , and groups from across global civil society including the trade union movement , in condemning this attempt to overthrow democracy in Brazil .

2016-05-27,"With regard to the recent suspension of President Dilma Rousseff ( Letters , 27 May ) , it needs to be pointed out that the impeachment process strictly complies with the requirements of the Brazilian constitution and the rule of law , under the scrutiny of the supreme court .
It is incorrect to depict the ongoing process as political manoeuvres taking place against the will of the electorate .
Under a democratic presidential regime , the votes received by a president do not prevent the commencement of an impeachment process to assess whether crimes of responsibility have been committed by the head of state .
The deputies and senators also received millions of votes and are expected to fulfil their constitutional duties , which include investigating and judging the president if he or she is charged with crimes of responsibility .
After the president was suspended , in accordance with the terms of the constitution , Vice - president Michel Temer took over as acting president on 12 May.
He has since assumed all the responsibilities related to his position as head of the executive .
As in 1992 , when the then Brazilian president was suspended , all cabinet ministers were replaced by the acting president .
The Brazilian embassy rejects any allegation that there has been an attempt to overthrow democracy in Brazil , or that the social programmes of recent years could be reversed .
Indeed , the acting president has clearly stated his commitment to continuing and improving existing social policies .

2016-05-31,"The reputation of Brazilâ€ ™ s new interim government has slipped from fragile to farcical after a minister tasked with fighting corruption was forced to resign over a secretly recorded conversation implicating him in a cover - up .
Just 18 days after being installed as part of the new cabinet , Fabiano Silveira became the second minister to lose his post as a result of leaked tapes suggesting there is a coordinated , high - level campaign to quash the Lava Jato ( car wash ) investigation into a kickback scandal involving the state - run oil company Petrobras and dozens of politicians .
The resignation of Silveira â€ “ who held the portfolio of â€œtransparency , monitoring and controlâ€ � â€ “ increases the pressure on the administration of Michel Temer , which is struggling to shake off allegations that it seized control from suspended president Dilma Rousseff in order to stifle the biggest corruption probe in the countryâ€ ™ s history .
Silveiraâ€ ™ s
portfolio put him in a key position in the anti - graft drive but his suitability for the job was called into question by the recording of his conversation in February with the head of the Senate , Renan Calheiros , whom prosecutors accuse of receiving massive kickbacks .
In the audio Silveira criticises the Lava Jato operation and offers advice on a defence strategy against it .
The broadcast of the audio by TV Globoâ€ ™ s flagship investigations program Fantastico on Sunday made the ministerâ€ ™ s position untenable .
Dozens of civil servants occupied his office on Monday morning .
Hundreds of others held a rally outside the presidential place .
The Berlin - based watchdog Transparency International said it would halt dialogue with Temerâ€ ™ s administration â€œuntil a full investigation is conducted and a new minister with adequate experience in the fight against corruption is appointedâ€
� .
Brazilâ€ ™ s most popular newspaper , O Globo , also printed an editorial calling for Temer to sack the minister and protect the Lava Jato probe .
â€œIt is the only way that his public commitment to support the operation and to fight against corruption will be taken seriously , â€ � it noted .
Questions about the interim president himself remain .
Temer has not been charged , but has been named by Lava Jato plea bargain witnesses as a â€œgodfatherâ€ � figure in the appointment of senior executives at the tainted oil company .
His all - male , all - white interim cabinet included seven ministers accused of accepting bribes in the scandal .
Last week one of the interim presidentâ€ ™ s key allies , Romero Juca , was forced to take indefinite leave from his influential post as planning minister after a recorded conversation revealed him plotting to impeach Rousseff to stem the â€œbleedingâ€ � from the Lava Jato investigation .
Barely two weeks into office , Temer is struggling to restore his credibility .
Hopes that his ascension to power would provide at least a short - term boost to the economy have been belied by a decline in the main Bovispa stock market index and a weakening of the currency against the US dollar .
The stand - in president was also forced into a U - turn on his downgrade of the culture ministry after protests by grammy - winning musician Caetano Veloso and other artists .
This article was amended 31 May 2016 to correct the circumstances of the revelation of Romero Jucaâ€ ™ s comments ."
2016-06-07,"Brazilâ€ ™ s embattled interim president , Michel Temer , has suffered a fresh blow after the prosecutor general requested the arrest of four of the most powerful members of his party for trying to obstruct the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into corruption at the state oil company Petrobras .
Following two ministerial resignations , Temerâ€ ™ s centre - right administration â€ “ which took power less than a month ago â€ “ now looks more vulnerable to the graft investigation than that of his predecessor , Dilma Rousseff , who is in the midst of an impeachment trial in the senate on unrelated charges .
Arguably the most influential of those targeted is Eduardo Cunha , who has already been suspended as speaker of congress for interfering with the investigation .
He is accused of receiving millions of dollars worth of kickbacks from overinflated contracts and stashing the cash in secret Swiss bank accounts .
Cunha â€ “ a leading member of the evangelical caucus in the lower house
â€ “ was the architect of Rousseffâ€
™ s impeachment , which he initiated after her Workersâ€ ™ party refused to protect him from related charges in the ethics committee of the lower house .
He is a member of Temerâ€ ™ s Brazil Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) , as are the other three figures whose arrest has been sought : senate chief Renan Calheiros , former president
JosÃ © Sarney and the partyâ€ ™ s leader in the upper house , Romero JucÃ¡.
In recent weeks , all three have been implicated by recordings suggesting they were trying to block the Lava Jato operation .
All deny the charges against them by the countryâ€ ™ s top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot .
In a statement , Calheiros said that the reported arrest request was â€œunreasonable , disproportionate and abusiveâ€ � .
The supreme court must now decide whether the politicians can be arrested .
The threat to these dominant figures in the upper and lower houses adds to the headaches of the president , who is trying to push a package of spending cuts through parliament and other measures to lift Brazil out of its worst recession in decades .
Inflation is in double digits and unemployment has hit a record high of 11.4 million workers .
Risks remain for other politicians in the government and opposition because the Lava Jato investigation has yet to run its course .
Among those threatened are half a dozen cabinet ministers , as well as former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva and defeated presidential candidate Aecio Neves .
Temer has not been charged , but he has been been named as an influential figure in Petrobras affairs in the plea testimonies of at least two of those involved in the scandal ."
2016-07-04,"On the night Brazilâ€ ™ s lower house voted to impeach the countryâ€ ™ s president Dilma Rousseff , she watched the proceedings on television with her predecessor in office , Luiz IgnÃ¡cio Lula da Silva .
Rousseff appeared calm throughout and even ordered popcorn .
But Lula â€ “ an unapologetically emotional man â€ “ broke into tears at least three times .
â€œIt was very sad .
I suffered a lot , â€ � the Workersâ€ ™ party founder recalled in an interview with the Guardian .
â€œI saw the project to transform this country falling apart.â€
�
Once a beacon of hope for a fairer global society , the Workersâ€ ™ party that Lula founded is being decapitated , and its achievements over 13 years of government in alleviating poverty , increasing access to education and boosting healthcare spending are unravelling as a result of recession and budget cuts .
When he left office in 2010 , Lula â€ “ as he is universally known â€
“ was the worldâ€ ™ s most popular president , a charismatic figurehead of a newly confident developing world and the architect of a democratic , centre - left project to reduce inequality in Brazil .
Since then , however , the economy has deteriorated , the global political winds have changed direction from cooperation to competition , and a vast anti - corruption investigation in Brazil has claimed swathes of senior politicians , including several of Lulaâ€ ™ s allies .
Today , he knows he could be put on trial any day .
The former president is the target of at least four criminal investigations ; his private phone calls have been secretly recorded and leaked to the media ; police have briefly detained him for questioning .
His successor , Roussef , f has been suspended , impeached and so undermined by the interim centre - right government that even though she is still officially president of Brazil , friends have started a crowdfunding campaign to pay for her travel expenses .
The downfall of the Workersâ€ ™ party government has been of Shakespearean proportions , though whether Lula is the victim or the villain remains a subject of fierce debate .
The question of who is to blame splits the country largely on political fault lines .
The right claims Lula is a King Lear - like figure who authored his own demise through economic mismanagement , political mistakes and by fostering a culture of corruption throughout the state sector .
The left portray him more as an Othello , a great leader undermined by treachery .
Mass protests earlier this year suggest many voters were tired of a politician and a party that failed to meet rising expectations and became enmeshed in a system they had promised to change .
Lula sees things differently .
He believes the Workersâ€ ™ partyâ€ ™ s emphasis on the poor , redistribution policies and increased spending on public education and health were resented by a political class that had grown used to having thing their way .
â€œI sincerely believe this bothered a lot of people .
There are now more ( newly middle class people ) in the streets , in theatres , in airports .
Part of the elite donâ€ ™ t want to share , â€ � he says .
The leaks and investigations , as he sees them , are part of a plot to remove the Workersâ€ ™ party and to prevent him from running again for president in two yearsâ€ ™ time .
â€œI believe there is an arrangement between some parts of the media , the prosecutorsâ€ ™ office and the police to destroy my image , â€ � he says .
â€œIt is all with one objective : to convict Lula .
[ There are people who believe ] â€˜we can not allow this man to run in 2018â€ ™
.â€ �
Given the broader regional context of recent election defeats for leftwing governments in Argentina , Venezuela and Bolivia , some on the left go further .
They see darker forces at work , including plots by the CIA .
But Lula dismisses suggestions the United States is involved in conspiracies to undermine leftwing leaders in the region .
â€œI donâ€
™ t believe it , â€ � he says .
â€œVenezuelans have reason to suspect the US because of the coup [ that briefly removed Hugo ChÃ¡vez ] in 2002 â€
¦
But I think the brothers in Venezuela are making a mistake .
They need dialogue with all sectors of society.â€ � Lula was a close ally of ChÃ¡vez and of Nestor Kirchner in Argentina .
Earlier this year , he reached for a football metaphor to describe the three of them in their heyday as the â€œMessi , Neymar and SuÃ¡rezâ€ � of the Latin American left .
Unlike his Venezuelan counterpart , however , Lula preferred negotiation to confrontation and refused to amend the constitution so he could run endlessly for office .
Instead , he stood down at the end of his second term and let Rousseff take his place .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve said many times that the most important thing in a democracy is a change in power .
I didnâ€
™ t run for a third ( consecutive ) term .
I donâ€
™ t believe in people who canâ€ ™ t be replaced .
Thatâ€ ™ s how dictatorship is born.â€
�
This makes him all the more frustrated at the way the Workersâ€ ™ party has been pushed from power although it has not been beaten in a national election since 1998 .
In 2014 , it won another four - year presidential mandate .
Yet less than half way through that term , it has been forced out .
â€œI lost three elections , but I respected the peopleâ€ ™ s choice of the winner , â€ � he said .
â€œBut the right wonâ€ ™ t wait.â€ �
He has not yet given up hope that Rousseff can make a comeback .
To survive in the final vote on 17 August , she needs to persuade six senators to change their minds .
It sounds like a small number , but Lula acknowledges they will require a huge amount of convincing .
Although he doesnâ€ ™ t say it directly , he seems exasperated that Rousseff does not put up more of a fight .
â€œDilma needs to say what will happen in Brazil if she returns to the presidency .
She has to say what she will do that will be new , how she will build new political relationships .
She must say that .
I canâ€ ™ t .
She must make people believe.â€ �
There has been constant speculation of a rift between Lula and Rousseff , particularly on the right .
One former president , Fernando Henrique Cordoso , told the Guardian Lulaâ€ ™ s biggest mistake was his choice of successor .
Another former president , JosÃ © Sarney , was secretly recorded saying Lula had told him much the same thing .
The plea - bargainer DelcÃ­dio do Amaral suggested the relationship between the two Workersâ€ ™ party leaders is competitive .
Adding fuel to this talk was Lulaâ€ ™ s decision not to join other senior party members at a farewell press conference for Rousseff at the Planalto presidential palace .
Lula , however , insists he has no regrets .
â€œIâ€ ™ m proud of nominating Dilma and getting her elected , â€ � he says .
It is Lula , however , who has generated the greatest passions .
Polls suggest he is still the most popular politician in Brazil , with a 21 % support rate , narrowly ahead of the former environment minister Marina Silva , on 19 % , and the former pro - business presidential candidate AÃ © cio Neves , on 17 % .
Rousseff barely scrapes 10 % , and the interim president , Michel Temer , according to the most recent survey , has an approval rating of 13 % .
Lula - a deeply divisive figure - also has the highest rejection rate of any politician , but he remains the focus of Workersâ€ ™ party hopes .
Many hope he will run and win again .
He says the decision will be up to the party .
â€œIâ€ ™ d like someone else to run .
I left with an 87 % approval rating .
I was the best president in the history of Brazil .
It is almost mission impossible to try to repeat that performance .
Iâ€ ™ d have to compete against myself.â€
�
The decision will also be up to the judges .
Lula is the prime target of the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into corruption at the state - run oil company Petrobras .
Prosecutors have uncovered a mountain of evidence that directors at Petrobras and other state - owned companies paid over the odds to contractors in return for kickbacks and campaign donations to politicians and parties in the ruling coalition .
Lulaâ€ ™ s supporters argue this common practice was ethically ugly but not illegal , adding that it predated the Workersâ€ ™ party and applied to all the other parties and also private sector deals .
Critics say that under Lula , corruption was systematised and elevated to new levels .
There is a reason for that .
Unlike the right , the Workersâ€ ™ party could not call on the private sector to provide the huge campaign funds needed to win elections and buy support in congress .
The best that can be said of this is that it was corruption for ideological rather than personal goals .
The worst is that it ran utterly contrary to the partyâ€ ™ s promise to clean up politics .
Instead , the Workersâ€ ™ party was sucked into the mire .
Lula claims the issue is simply one of campaign funding and could best be cleared up by reform .
â€œWhy
donâ€
™ t they investigate how all political parties raise funds?â€
� the former president says .
â€œThe way it has been done , you get the impression that all the money for the PT [ Workersâ€ ™ party ] is dirty , and all the money to the PSDB [ the rightwing Brazilian Social Democratic party ] is clean.â€ �
But regardless of the claim of double standards , shouldnâ€ ™ t Lula â€ “ as the former leader of the country and the party who benefited politically from this system â€ “ be held responsible for endemic corruption that cheated the public out of billions of reais ?
That is the charge that has been made by prosecutors , who allege Lula was the mastermind of the illegal Petrobras scheme .
The former president insists this is based on a mistaken assumption .
â€œThere is the theory that â€˜the boss must knowâ€ ™ or that we are guilty of incompetence [ for not knowing ] .
But there is no crime , â€ � he claims .
This is not the only threat from investigators .
The most advanced case against him is that he obstructed justice and set in motion an attempt to buy off a potential witness against him .
The plea - bargainer Amaral told the Guardian he had testified that Lula asked him to â€œhelp outâ€ � a former Petrobras director , Nestor Cervero , who was arrested last year .
This led first to payments to the detained manâ€ ™ s family and then to discussions about how to get him out of the country by plane or boat .
Lula says Amaral is lying .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s built a fantasy narrative to help himself , â€ � he says , arguing that the judgeâ€ ™ s use of preventive detentions to secure plea - bargains is bound to produce distorted testimonies .
Several of these cases are now in the hands of Sergio Moro , a Curitiba - based judge who has become a nationwide celebrity thanks to his willingness to imprison rich and powerful people who were previously able to enjoy impunity .
Moro has a reputation for working quickly and ignoring reputations .
Many of Lulaâ€ ™ s family members and friends fear Moro will soon put the former president on trial .
Lula claims he faces the prospect with equanimity because he believes in the Brazilian justice system .
â€œThere is nobody in Brazil who is as tranquil as me , â€ � he says .
â€œIf I face trial , weâ€ ™ ll know whether [ the allegations against me ] are true or not.â€
�
At 70 years of age , the Brazilian Workersâ€ ™ party founder may feel he has earned the right to be sanguine .
He has experienced far worse .
He was brought up in such abject poverty that he sometimes lacked enough to eat as a child .
His brother was jailed and tortured during the dictatorship era .
He fought alongside British miners in their failed challenge to Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s .
He lost three presidential elections before a historic win in 2002 .
More recently , he underwent chemotherapy for throat cancer .
Despite the legal Sword of Damocles hanging over him , Lula feels his place in history is secure .
â€œThe major achievements of the past 13 years will not be lost whether Iâ€ ™ m on trial or not , â€ � he says .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t plan to change what I am .
I was the best [ president ] ever.â€ �"
2016-07-05,"When she was president , Dilma Rousseffâ€ ™ s administration did not always generate solidarity between feminists .
There was often a marked line between those who tried to work with her government on developing better public policies and those who rejected her administration , citing the lack of advances in reproductive rights , in the political sphere and in education during her term .
However , almost all feminists agree that her impeachment was sexist and discriminatory .
Not only have many male politicians been found to have practised pedaladas fiscais â€ “ using public bank funds to finance federal or state social programmes , apparently without any consequences , but those who voted for her impeachment are being investigated for corruption for personal gain .
Although independent auditors have found Rousseff had no involvement in pedaladas fiscais , few believe she will be exonerated in the impeachment trial .
Since Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment , thousands of women across Brazil have come together to express solidarity with her .
New movements , such as Mulheres Pela Democracia ( Women for Democracy ) , have sprung up in support as women have marched in protest and even sent Rousseff letters and pictures empathising with the injustice of her ousting , and warning of its future implications .
The most conservative congress since the end of Brazilâ€ ™ s military dictatorship is now responsible for both the political coup and the growing attacks on womenâ€ ™ s rights .
Prior to the impeachment , politicians on all sides had passed a raft of bills chipping away at womenâ€ ™ s rights , including a bill to define personhood from the moment of conception , and another to define â€œfamilyâ€ � in the constitution as the union of a man and woman and their child .
Other bills were introduced to prohibit the discussion of gender in the National Education Plan , and to further criminalise legal abortion for victims of rape .
There were moves to make it difficult to access emergency contraception , and to increase the penalty for abortion in the wake of the Zika virus .
At the same time , none of the old problems went away : violence against women is still endemic , and there is widespread acceptance of sexual violence in society .
More than 1 million women undergo illegal abortions every year .
Over the past year , however , women have been fighting back in much greater numbers and with renewed vigour .
In October , during what has been dubbed Brazilâ€ ™ s â€œfeminist springâ€ �
( Primavera das Mulheres ) , hundreds of thousands of women protested on the streets and through social media against sexual violence , paedophilia , and the sexist bills aiming to limit their reproductive rights .
Younger women and girls are using social media and technology to become informed , debate and mobilise on womenâ€ ™ s issues .
They have declared their support for feminism through internet - based campaigns such as # MeuPrimeiroAssedio ( My First Assault ) and # ForaCunha ( Get Out Cunha â€ “ aimed at removing the politician Eduardo Cunha , seen as Rousseffâ€ ™ s accuser - in - chief ) , which garnered hundreds of thousands of likes and tweets on Facebook and Twitter .
Last month , hundreds of thousands of women united across Brazil and Argentina under the banner : Por Todas Elas ( For All Women ) , protesting against rape culture , after 33 men allegedly gang - raped a 16-year - old girl in Rio de Janeiro in May.
Between October 2015 and January 2016 alone , the search for the word â€œfeminismâ€ � on Google in Brazil rose by 86 % .
More women have begun to identify themselves as feminist , and even begun introducing new vocabulary , such as the word â€œsororityâ€ � â€ “ which does not exist in Brazilian dictionaries and was virtually unheard of until 2015 â€ “ to describe solidarity with other women .
Agora Juntas , a group of feminist collectives and women in Rio de Janeiro , which I founded , is building a feminist hub to encourage greater collaboration and solidarity .
Many feminist groups are under - resourced , and compete for what little funding there is .
Unfortunately , despite the increased feminist mobilisation , the situation is still bleak .
Michel Temerâ€ ™ s new government has gone backwards in terms of the rights of women and minority and indigenous groups .
Under his all - white , all - male administration , politicians are attempting to undermine the Maria de Penha law , which was a landmark victory to increase domestic violence convictions and support victims .
They have submitted a bill to give police powers to approve protective measures for women ; at the moment the judiciary is the only body that has these powers .
Nevertheless , the final insult for women has been the Temer administrationâ€ ™ s appointment of the conservative FÃ¡tima Pelaes as the secretary of politics for women .
Pelaes has previously declared that she does not support abortion as a legal option for women who have been raped .
Perhaps it is no surprise to learn that since his interim government assumed power , the World Economic Forum has calculated that the country will fall from its 2015 ranking of 85th in the WEF gender equality index to number 107 .
In an essay , The Patriarchal Coup , Maria BetÃ¢nia Ã � vila , sociologist , researcher of SOS Corpo Instituto para a Democracia , and member of ArticulaÃ§Ã£o de Mulheres Brasileiras , writes : â€œThe feminist movement [ in Brazil ] is showing its capacity for resistance and mobilisation in defence of the first democratically elected female presidentâ€ ™ s mandate and democratic legality .

Amid the cries of â€œFora , Temer!â€ � ( Out with Temer ) , feminists are reminding Brazil of the need to re - instate Rousseff , and to ensure that future governments implement reforms and public policies that guarantee human rights and social dignity , and combat inequality .
Until then we will continue to shout : â€œWithout women , there is no democracy .
Without feminism , there is no democracy.â€ �

2016-07-07,"Brazilâ€ ™ s lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha has resigned in tears less than three months after he orchestrated the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff .
His departure is the latest twist in the countryâ€ ™ s ongoing political turmoil , but few are likely to lament the reviled head of a despised institution .
Cunha â€ “ an ultra - conservative evangelical â€ “ had already been suspended by the supreme court while he is investigated for alleged corruption , intimidation of lawmakers , obstruction of justice and abuse of power .
Although he has denied the charges and previously vowed to stay in his post , he has come under increasing pressure to step down .
This week , his former ally in the Brazilian Democratic Movement party , interim president Michel Temer , advised him it was time to go .
Cunhaâ€ ™ s resignation speech was typically abrasive : â€œIt is well known that the house is brainless , â€ �
he said of the institution he helped to shape .
He described his treatment as cruel and inhuman , wished success to Temer and his successor , and then called on god to bless Brazil , before departing the stage he has dominated since 2015 .
The question now is whether Cunha will also be stripped of his seat in the lower house , which would expose him to a possible trial in the lower courts .
Police involved in the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation say privately this is only a matter of time because there is so much evidence against him .
While many in Brazil would like to see him go to jail , the prospect is likely to alarm many of his former allies .
Like Frank Underwood in House of Cards , Cunha is thought to have built a political power base on his knowledge of other
politicianâ€ ™ s dirty secrets .
According to the domestic media , he has warned Temer that if he goes to prison , he will not go alone .
Cunha initiated the impeachment process against Rousseff last December as a form of retribution after her Workers party refused to back him in the ethics committee .
But if he hoped the battle against the president would also divert attention from his case , or win rewards from those he put in power , he has been proved wrong .
â€œCunha was very functional in destroying Dilma , now he is being destroyed , â€ � former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso told the Guardian shortly before the speaker was suspended .
Cunha is one of three senior figures in the ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) , alongside Temer and Upper house leader Renan Calheiros .
A trained economist , he was a protege of Fernando Collor , the only previous president to have been impeached since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985 .
He converted to the Assembly of God â€ “ one of the countryâ€ ™ s biggest evangelical churches â€ “ and rose to notoriety as the outspoken host of a radio show on an evangelical station .
With support from the Christian right , he won his first seat in the chamber of deputies in 2003 as a representative of Rio de Janeiro , and became speaker in 2015 .
In polls , he is consistently among the most unpopular politicians in the nation .
A Datafolha survey earlier this year found 77 % of the voters wanted Cunha to be stripped of his mandate , compared to 61 - 67 % for Rousseff .
Public anger has been stirred by reports that he hid $ 5 m in illegal kickbacks in a secret Swiss bank account , that he threatened opponents and enjoyed a profligate lifestyle that was far beyond the means of his declared annual income of $ 120,000 .
Prosecutors have leaked credit card statements showing that Cunha and his family splurged $ 40,000 on a nine - day family holiday in Miami at the end of 2013 , then followed this with similar shopping and restaurant sprees in Paris , New York and Zurich .
Cunha and his wife also allegedly own a fleet of eight luxury cars , including a Porsche , which were registered under the name of Jesus.com and C3 Productions ."
2016-07-19,"The run - up to every Olympics is marked by anxiety and controversy , but Rio de Janeiro has arguably outdone all of its predecessors on this score .
Against a backdrop of economic recession , the impeachment of Brazilâ€ ™ s president Dilma Rousseff , a Zika epidemic , resurgent crime and water pollution , the cityâ€ ™ s officials are not only having to fight off accusations of corruption , incompetence and unbalanced priorities , they are also battling to justify whether the Games were worth hosting in the first place .
In this polemical combat , the establishment - the Rio city government and the International Olympics Committee - argue the event boosts economic developments and raises the global profile of the host .
Challenging this is an array of social activists , critical academics , political opponents , displaced residents and environmental campaigners who argue that the Olympics are disruptive , destructive and skewed to benefit a wealthy elite .
But beyond all the angry headlines , is it possible to assess exactly how this city of more than 6 million people has really been impacted â€ “ for good and bad â€ “ by the awarding of the Olympics in 2009 ?
To assess this in the long term , it is necessary to go beyond the media furore and focus instead on the likely legacy for Rioâ€ ™ s residents .
One of the most controversial issues for years has , of course , been the question of displacement : just how many residents have been uprooted as a result of building projects around Rio for the Olympics , not to mention the 2014 football World Cup ?
Where have they been moved to , with what compensation â€ “ and who is benefitting from the property ( often very central ) that they left ?
The numbers are contested .
The city puts the numbers in the hundreds .
On the other extreme is an estimate that Rio moved 22,100 families ( average size of 3.5 people ) in 2015 , 20,200 families in 2014 , 19,200 families in 2013 and more than 10,000 before then .
This is the calculation of critics Lena Azevedo and Lucas Faulhaber in their book , RemoÃ§Ãµes no Rio OlÃ­mpico .
Based on these figures , they say the current Rio mayor Eduardo Paes has far exceeded the cityâ€ ™
s
previous two big people - moving city bosses Carlos Lacerda ( 1961 - 1965 ) with 30,000 relocations and Pereira Passos ( 1902 - 1906 ) , who dislodged 20,000 people .
Paes says these numbers are grossly exaggerated by political opponents .
Then there is the issue of where resources are allocated , which again stirs up disputes .
â€œWithout question , the main beneficiaries of the Olympic - related investments have been construction firms , real - estate companies , private security firms , and industries related to gentrification and car - dependent landscapes , â€ � notes Chris Gaffney , a researcher at the University of Zurich and a prominent critic of the Rio Games .
Nonsense , insists Paes , who says accusations that the Olympics favour the wealthy South Zone of the city are just plain wrong .
â€œThere has never been so much transformation for poor people , â€ � the mayor claims .
â€œSeventy - five percent of my investment is in the north and west of the city .
Thatâ€ ™ s where I get my votes.â€
�
Although he has cosied up to property developers and construction firms , Paes says this has been done transparently and that it has benefited taxpayers because entrepreneurs have financed 58 % of Games - related projects â€ “ which means there is less of a strain on the public purse than was the case during preparations for the World Cup .
But are poorer areas really sharing the Olympic benefits equally ?
The Guardian visited the five major venue clusters to find out .
Barra da Tijuca and the west
Despite the inflated , sprawling nature of the modern Olympics , the Rio Games have an evident geographic heart in the Barra da Tijuca / JacarepaguÃ ¡
district on the western side of the city .
Less clear is whether this location
â€ “ site of the athletesâ€ ™ village , Olympic Park and Olympic golf course
â€ “ has been chosen to pump economic benefits throughout the entire city , or mainly to a wealthy elite .
No area has undergone such a dramatic transformation .
Barra â€ “ which was mostly swampland and plantation 40 years ago
â€ “ has long been the fastest developing region of Rio as it races towards a Miami - style vision of broad highways , mega - shopping malls and gated communities .
The Olympics has supercharged that trend , thanks to an influx of public and private money to build stadiums , roads , water - treatment plants , electricity pylons and a metro extension .
Carlos Carvalho , one of the three biggest landowners in the area and a major investor in several Olympic projects , believes Barraâ€ ™ s growth has been accelerated by 30 years : â€œThe most difficult part of the development plan was the service infrastructure , and the Olympics has brought that .
Itâ€ ™ s a billion - dollar jump
, â€ � he told the Guardian last year .
More controversially , Carvalho claimed his ultimate goal was to shift Rioâ€ ™ s centre to Barra , even if it meant evicting poorer communities to the periphery so that a â€œnobleâ€ � elite had precedence .
He has subsequently been encouraged not to talk to the media â€ “ reportedly on the advice of Paes , who cut his political teeth in Barra and received donations from Carvalho and other donors for his re - election campaign .
Shortly after winning the race , the mayor approved a controversial Olympic golf development and changed building codes so developers could construct taller towers in this coastal region .
While the business community hopes economic opportunities will improve , social scientists and evicted residents are critical .
â€œOur community has been lost .
We are living in containers while new houses are being built , â€ � says Maria da Penha , a prominent member of the Vila AutÃ³dromo communityâ€ ™ s resistance against relocation until her home was demolished .
â€œThe Olympics is really bad - this is no legacy ,
â€ �
she continues .
â€œVila
AutÃ³dromo has become an entirely new community : if you come and visit again , you wonâ€ ™ t recognise anything .
The history of Vila AutÃ³dromo will remain in our memories and we are trying to preserve its history , but nothing is left .
Not one shop , nothing .
Everything is new.â€ �
For critics , this is one of many indicators that the cityâ€ ™ s priorities are skewed towards the wealthy .
â€œBarra has long been considered an â€˜off worldâ€ ™ for Rioâ€ ™ s emerging upper - middle classes , and there was even a secession attempt in the 1980s , â€ � says Gaffney .
â€œAs the rest of the city sees billions of public funds poured into the subsidisation of highways , shopping malls and spaces of elite privilege , there will inevitably be negative consequences as opportunity costs increase over time.â€ � Possible collusion between officials and developers is also being investigated .
Two of the biggest partners in the Olympic Park developments â€ “ construction firms Odebrecht and Andrade Gutierrez â€ “ are separately implicated in the biggest bribery and kickback scandal in Brazilâ€ ™ s history : the Lava Jato ( â€œCar washâ€ � ) investigation into accusations of wrongdoing at the oil company Petrobras .
Prosecutors are examining whether similar wrongdoing took place on Olympics contracts .
While lawyer Jean Carlos Novaes claims Lava Jato documents reveal foul play in the bidding for Olympic construction contracts , he acknowledges that corruption is nothing new â€ “ and says it has merely been accelerated as a result of this mega - event .
The mayor refutes these allegations .
The Olympics , he says , will prove that not all projects in Brazil involve corruption .
In the business community , people are positive .
Laudimiro Cavalcanti , director of the Rio Chamber of Commerce , believes it was natural for the city to use Barra as a dynamo for investment and development .
Until now , she says , the big problem for the region was urban mobility â€ “ and this is being solved by the road building and metro extension .
â€œThis will have a big impact on the neighbourhood .
It will boost property values , help shopping centres , and bring growth to the real - estate market , â€ �
Cavalcanti predicts .
â€œBarra is the region that will benefit most .
There will be a boost for tourism in the area .
And it will be good for Rio as a whole , because the city will be at the centre of the worldâ€ ™ s attention.â€ �
JW The port area and old city centre
Arguably no area of Rio de Janeiro has undergone a more radical transformation in the years since the city won the right to host the Olympics than the port area â€ “ though this development is less an integral part of the Games themselves than a shop window for potential investors .
Once dominated by the Perimetral , a monstrous elevated highway that was finally torn down in 2014 , this historic area has so far gained an expansive pedestrianised boulevard which serves as a disembarkation point for cruise ship passengers , a collection of striking museums , and the VLT light railway system â€ “ at a cost of R$1.15bn ( Â£230 m ) , its 17 miles of track will eventually connect the intercity bus station , the ferry terminal , the metro and the domestic airport .
The total cost of Meu Porto Maravilha ( or â€œMy Wonderful Portâ€ � , as this public - private partnership scheme is known ) was estimated at R$8bn in June 2011 by Alberto Silva , the head of the development company set up by City Hall to manage the project .
Already , around R$5bn has been spent , four years into this gargantuan 15-year plan .
In all , the project covers seven neighbourhoods .
Mercedes GuimarÃ£es , 60 , who has lived in the district of Gamboa on - and - off since the mid-1960s , says that a combination of official neglect and laws designed to preserve the facades of historic buildings had resulted in decades of disrepair .
â€œSometimes
I hear people who donâ€ ™ t live here complain about the changes
, â€ � she says .
â€œIt could be better but for those who never got anything in the past , I think it is excellent.â€
�
The Wonderful Port project covers a total area of five million square metres , and includes the cityâ€ ™ s docks , its old slave market , its first favela , its samba school warehouses and the PraÃ§a MauÃ ¡ , which now houses the Santiago Calatrava - designed Museum of Tomorrow
( a building described as a cross between a solar - powered dinosaur and a giant air - conditioning unit ) .
One of the most controversial projects was the construction of a cable car across the Morro da ProvidÃªncia favela , at a cost of R$75 m .
Originally , the plans envisaged the removal of around a third of the neighbourhoodâ€ ™ s 5,000 or so residents but , after locals fought back , that number was reduced â€ “ and around 140 homes were eventually destroyed , according to Amnesty International .
â€œBasic sanitation would have been more useful , â€ � says Cosme Felippsen , a resident and tour guide .
â€œBut there was no dialogue and the government just did what it pleased.â€
�
With no takers as yet for its operating concession , some fear the cable car could stop running soon after the Games end .
For Pedro Moreira , president of the Rio branch of the Brazilian Architectsâ€ ™ Association , the main concern about the port area is whether the city has done enough to attract new residents .
â€œWe are worried about the lack of housing .
At the moment , lots of companies and hotels are moving in , but it needs more residents for the neighbourhood to feel alive , â€ � he says .
Around 30,000 people live in the port area at present , but the development hopes to bring in another 70,000 over the next 10 years .
Isabel Dias , who recently bought a house in ProvidÃªncia with the aim of turning it into a social enterprise , says that so many big corporate investors â€ “ including a certain Donald Trump â€ “ were now involved in the project that she believes the area will attract new residents .
â€œMy concern is that local residents donâ€ ™ t lose out , â€ �
she says .
â€œThey are not really being included at the moment.â€ � BD Guanabara Bay A clean - up of Guanabara Bay , which hosts three of the five Olympic sailing courses , was the most ambitious of the pledges made by Rio when it bid for the Games in 2009 .
But in the years since , the greatest hope has proved the biggest disappointment .
This vast body of water gave the city its name ( the first Portuguese explorers to arrive here mistook it for the estuary of a mighty river , hence the misnomer Rio de Janeiro â€ “ January river ) , but the picture - postcard setting has never been quite what it seems .
More recently , the stunning beauty of the bay â€ “ backdrop for some of Rioâ€ ™ s most spectacular sights
â€ “ has been at odds with an often appalling stench of human waste and other forms of pollution .
This comes in part from the petrochemical industry that is a mainstay of the Rio economy .
But the primary cause , particularly near the yachting courses , is the waste that flows into the bay from surrounding communities , many of which emerged during periods of unregulated urban growth .
According to the state government ( the tier of administration responsible for the water quality of the bay ) , there have been improvements .
Since 2009 , the state - run water company CEDAE claims to have spent more than Â£500 m on tripling sewage treatment in the bay .
Among the most recent improvements is a clean - up of the Marina da GlÃ³ria , complete with a new sewerage system to deal with the foul sludge that used to gush into the harbour .
Despite this , only 49 % of the sewage that flows into Guanabara Bay is treated .
In its hosting document , the Olympic organisers promised above 80 % .
Specifically , they said they would build two major river treatment units : one on the Rio IrajÃ ¡
that would deal with 11 % of the waste , and another on the Rio Pavuna , which would handle 22 % .
There were tenders , and environmental licences were issued , but the state government failed to come up with the funds .
IrajÃ ¡ was built but has yet to begin operations ; Pavuna never even got started .
â€œGuanabara Bay is still a latrine , â€ � says the conservationist Mario Moscatelli , who makes helicopters monitoring trips of the region every month .
â€œItâ€ ™ s as if they had promised a Porsche V16 and are now giving us a Volkswagen 1200.â€ �
The consequences are an embarrassment to the city , and a worry for Olympic participants .
The stink of the bay , which is worst near major population centres , frequently assaults the nostrils of visitors on the journey from GaleÃ£o international airport to the city centre .
Of greater impact on the competition , sailors in test events have complained that along with the bad smell , they have to deal with debris â€ “ including furniture , plastic bags and dead fish â€ “ that could impede their vessels .
Nets , barriers and rubbish - fishing vessels are likely to provide a temporary fix .
Most alarming and harder to overcome , however , are the health risks , with several recent studies indicating harmful levels of viruses , fecal coliform bacteria and even super bacteria in the waters .
While the technology to resolve these problems exists , the budget and political will appear to be lacking .
David Zee , oceanography professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro , says the same pattern was evident at other sites that were supposed to have been improved in time for the Games .
â€œThe legacy that was most forgotten â€ “ even though it was the most commented on â€ “ was the environmental legacy ,
â€ �
Zee says .
â€œWhen it comes to waterways â€ “ Guanabara Bay , the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon , the Complexo Lagunar de JacarepaguÃ ¡
â€
“ the state government did nothing .
Itâ€ ™ s
their modus operandi : a lot of talking and no action.â€
�
This was the case even before the current economic downturn .
With Brazil now suffering its deepest recession in decades and Rio particularly badly hit , the prospects of a clean - up look more distant than ever .
But the TV images will probably still look stunning â€ “ as long as viewers do not look too closely and it doesnâ€ ™ t rain , which always increases waste flows .
JW The South Zone
On the surface , there has been little change to Rioâ€ ™ s wealthy South Zone , home not only of the world famous Copacabana and Ipanema beaches but also Rocinha , which is often described as the largest favela in Latin America .
With the area already highly developed and only a handful of Olympic events taking place here ( beach volleyball , rowing and marathon swimming ) , most of the changes have been taking place out of full view
â€ “ although these do include what the Rio state government is calling the â€œgreatest transport legacyâ€ � of the Olympic Games .
An extension to Rioâ€ ™ s current two - line metro system is due to open days before the Olympics , to carry Games ticket - holders from Ipanema to Barra da Tijuca .
The R$9.7bn extension will open to the public in September and is expected to carry more than 300,000 people a day .
Critics , however , argue that it will primarily benefit an already wealthy area of the city .
One of the major question marks over Rioâ€ ™ s Olympic bid was security .
By the time it secured the Games in 2009 , violent crime was down significantly on its mid-1990s levels
â€ “ but by any international comparison
, Rio was still a dangerous city .
Officials promised to set up â€œpolice pacification unitsâ€ � ( UPPs ) in 40 of Rioâ€
™ s 1,000 favelas by the time of the Games , installing a police presence for the very first time in previously gang - controlled communities .
Since the first UPP was established in Santa Marta , a favela in the South Zone , 38 communities have now been â€œpacifiedâ€ � .
Despite initial successes in community policing , many favela residents have become disillusioned after years of aggressive tactics by UPP officers .
â€œThe police is still a violent , military organisation , â€ � says Gabriel Siqueira , 27 , from the Federation of Rio de Janeiroâ€ ™ s Favela Associations .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t have the capacity to implement a policy like pacification.â€ �
Others criticise the failure of the local government to deliver promised services , such as running water , safe electricity and sewage collection , in the wake of the policing initiative .
The upper middle - class residents of the South Zone , supposedly beneficiaries of reduced crime in neighbouring favelas , claim to have noticed little difference over the years .
â€œNothing has changed , â€ � says Eduardo Barbosa , 29 , who has lived in Ipanema all his life .
â€œYou still hear the shout â€˜Catch the thief!â€ ™ on the streets here on a regular basis.â€
�
Statistically , however , there has been a significant drop in violent crime since the start of the UPP programme , though the last few months have seen some of those gains begin to reverse .
Many Cariocas , as Rioâ€ ™ s residents are known , question whether pacification will last after the Olympics , given the enormous cost , the stateâ€ ™ s dire finances and the haemorrhaging of public support .
For Robert Muggah , research director of the IgarapÃ © Institute , the 2013 disappearance of Amarildo de Souza , a bricklayer from the Rocinha favela who was tortured and murdered by officers from the local UPP , marked a turning point for the programme .
â€œSupport for the policy is failing , â€ � he says .
â€œPeople have lost faith.â€ �
Around the picturesque Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon security has never been better , according to Ildo de Souza , who earns a living renting out pedaloes there .
But he doesnâ€ ™ t expect it to last .
â€œAfter the Olympics everything will change , â€ � he said .
â€œThe bad guys will be back out in force.â€ � BD Deodoro and the North Zone Few Olympic projects have generated as much enthusiasm among locals as the Parque Madureira , the 92,000 sq m park that was opened in 2012 .
The huge metal Olympic rings that once adorned the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle now sit in the middle of this park , alongside other attractions such as a samba stage , an artificial beach and a skate park .
Previously , there were virtually no green spaces in Rioâ€ ™ s arid , sprawling and relatively impoverished North Zone .
â€œFor me
itâ€ ™ s the best thing , â€ � says Greice Lopes , 36 , a mother of two .
â€œBefore there was nowhere to walk with my kids .
If you want a moment to walk , think or pray , this is a wonderful place.â€ �
During the Games , the park will be one of three â€œlive sitesâ€ � where residents will be able to watch the action on huge screens .
Though the space now pleases many locals , City Hall acknowledges 771 families were forced out of the Vila das Torres favela to make way for this long - planned R$278 m park , which sits between the Olympic facilities in Deodoro and the two main North Zone stadiums : the JoÃ£o Havelange Olympic Stadium , which will host the athletics , and the MaracanÃ£ , which will host the final stages of the football and the opening and closing ceremonies .
â€œThere was a conflict , a lot of resistance , â€ � says Raphaella Santos , a graduate student at Rio de Janeiroâ€ ™ s Rural Federal University who studied the development .
â€œIt was very traumatic for a lot of the residents.â€ � â€œRent has gone up a lot round here , and so some people have had to leave , â€ � says Jorge de Souza , 65 , a seven - year resident of the Engenho de Dentro suburb , which has been upgraded for the Games at a cost of around R$52 m .
Further west , around R$825 m has been invested in Deodoro , site of an active military base .
Eleven Olympic and four Paralympic events , including equestrianism , wheelchair fencing and rugby , will be held in the area and , for the most part , the Olympic developments have been welcomed by residents of this sleepy corner of Rio .
â€œCommercially speaking , itâ€ ™ s been great , â€ � says Marco Aurelio , the 47-year - old president of the local residentsâ€ ™ association .
â€œItâ€ ™ s put Deodoro on the map ; the flow of business has increased , and the place is attracting investors.â€ �
But many here question whether the authorities have the will and money to maintain the facilities in the long - run .
Though the new X - Park â€ “ which will host the slalom canoe and BMX competitions â€ “ is due to be handed over to the public after the Games , locals remain sceptical : â€œWe
donâ€ ™ t know
whatâ€ ™ s going to happen afterwards , â€ � says Eloy do Nascimento , 58 .
â€œI think it could be privatised.â€ � BD Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion

2016-08-28,"Brazilâ€ ™ s impeachment battle is set to reach a dramatic climax this week as the countryâ€ ™ s first female president , Dilma Rousseff , makes a last stand before a hostile and corruption - plagued Senate .
The Workers party leader , who was suspended from the presidency in May , is scheduled to testify in her own defence on Monday morning , a day or two before the upper house is expected to vote for her permanent ejection from office for alleged fiscal irregularities .
The final face - to - face encounter between accusers and accused comes after a period of protracted political turmoil that cast a shadow over the Olympics , stirred up massive street protests and worsened the recession plaguing Latin Americaâ€ ™ s biggest economy .
Escalating what has already proved a rowdy political trial , Rousseff will be grilled by opponents from the centre - right coalition of the interim president , Michel Temer , a former running mate from the Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) who conspired to seize power less than half way through her mandate and now hopes to retain the presidency until at least the next election in 2018 .
The last president to be impeached â€ “ Fernando Collor de Mello in 1992 â€ “ resigned rather than face a final vote .
But Rousseff , a former Marxist guerrilla who was tortured during the military dictatorship , has vowed to fight to the end .
â€œThe only thing that kills anti - democratic parasites is the oxygen of debate , â€ �
she told supporters last week .
Impeachment supporters believe a final vote â€ “ which is expected to be passed by the necessary two - thirds majority of the 81 senators on Tuesday or Wednesday â€ “ will provide catharsis and allow Temerâ€ ™ s administration to plot a new course for the nation .
Opponents say it is the culmination of a constitutional coup to end 13 years of Workers party rule , runs roughshod over the democratic choice of the 54 million voters who re - elected Rousseff in 2014 , reverses progress towards gender and ethnic equality and is part of a plot to curtail the â€œLava Jatoâ€ � ( car wash ) corruption investigation that has implicated dozens of senior politicians .
The numbers are against the president .
At the start of the senate impeachment process in May , Rousseff was defeated by 55 votes to 22 , which was just one above the 54 that will be needed in the final vote .
Newspaper forecasts suggest there has been little progress since then in swaying senators to switch sides , but Rousseffâ€ ™ s supporters have not given up hope of a last - minute reprieve and promise to fight to the end .
â€œThere will be a very strong debate because all sides are tense , â€ �
one senator , Vanessa Grazziotin , told local media in a warning that Rousseffâ€ ™ s supporters in the upper house would not let the president go quietly â€œlike a lamb to the slaughterâ€ � .
In the early years of her presidency , she was one of the most popular leaders in the world , with approval ratings of 92 % .
But Rousseff , a poor communicator who presided over several years of decline and upheaval , has become deeply unpopular with the electorate and for much of the past year her approval ratings have hovered around 10 % .
Many of her allies , including the former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , have been implicated in the Lava Jato investigation into corruption at Petrobras , which has tainted almost all of the major parties .
As a former energy minister and head of her party , critics say , Rousseff should have known what was going on , but she has not been charged .
Instead , she is being impeached for window - dressing government accounts before the last election by issuing decrees on spending without congressional approval and waiting several months to reimburse a state - owned bank for a low - interest financing scheme for family farmers .
Senators must decide if this is a â€œcrime of responsibilityâ€ � that merits removal from office .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s
lawyers claim the argument against her is more political than legal .
Similar fiscal irregularities went unpunished in previous national and regional administrations , but they are a pretext to remove a leader who has struggled to assert her authority .
There are widespread concerns about the way she has been elbowed out of power by her former running mate , Temer , who conspired against her even though he , as former vice - president , bore a similar share of responsibility for failed economic policies and widespread corruption .
Opinion polls suggest the interim president is almost as despised as his predecessor .
â€œFora Temer!â€ � ( Temer out ) placards were prominently displayed during the Olympics .
He was loudly booed during the opening ceremony , which was attended by far fewer foreign leaders than London 2012 or Beijing 2008 â€ “ a sign of international unease about the political situation in Brazil .
This was highlighted on Thursday by an open letter signed by 22 prominent overseas figures , including Stephen Fry , Naomi Klein , Noam Chomsky , Oliver Stone , Arundhati Roy and Alan Cumming .
In a declaration of concern about the installation of an unelected government , the authors said : â€œThe legal basis for the ongoing impeachment is widely questionable and there is convincing evidence showing that the main drivers of the impeachment campaign are trying to remove the president in order to stop corruption investigations in which they themselves are involved.â€ �
When she makes an initial 30-minute address to the Senate from 9 am , Rousseff is expected to present evidence for this claim .
She has previously noted that the impeachment process was launched by the former house speaker Eduardo Cunha after the Workers party refused to protect him from corruption and perjury accusations in the congressional ethics committee .
Tapes of secretly recorded conversations have also revealed that Temerâ€ ™ s most powerful ally in the upper house
â€ “ the PMDB Senate leader Romero JucÃ ¡
â€ “ was plotting to oust Rousseff because he wanted to curtail the Lava Jato investigation , which implicated him and dozens of other politicians in the multibillion - dollar corruption scandal at the state oil company Petrobras .
Following the presidentâ€ ™ s statement , senators will begin their interrogation .
It is likely to be a noisily partisan affair .
Up to 20 supporters from each side will be invited into the chamber .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s allies will include Lula , the former president , senior ministers and the musician Chico Buarque , who has been prominent at many anti - impeachment rallies .
Their opponents will include leaders of the Vem Pra Rua ( take to the streets ) campaign and the libertarian Movimento Brasil Livre ( Free Brazil Movement ) .
Several questions â€ “ including the first of the session from KatiÃ ¡
Abreu â€ “ will come from allies , which will provide an opportunity for the president to highlight the positives of her time in office .
Since the Workers party gained power in 2003 , tens of millions of Brazilians have moved out of poverty thanks to â€œbolsa familiaâ€ � welfare payments , increased access to education and â€ “ until the last few years â€ “ a strong economy .
She will also declare once again her innocence of any crime .
Her supporters also emphasise that Rousseff has a far cleaner record than that of many of her accusers in both the lower and upper house .
Last week , the Workers party senator Gleisi Hoffmann told the upper house that â€œno one hereâ€ � had the moral ground to judge Rousseff .
She was rebuked by the Senate president , Renan Calheiros , who said the debate was proving only that â€œstupidity is infiniteâ€ � .
As tensions rose , the chief justice of the supreme court , Ricardo Lewandowski â€ “ who is presiding over the political trial â€ “ had to call for a recess .
He may well be forced to intervene again as tensions rise in the coming decisive days ."
2016-08-29,"Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president , Dilma Rousseff , put up a fight in keeping with her Marxist guerrilla background on Monday with a powerful denunciation of the politicians who are poised to eject her from power within days .
Testifying in her own defence before a predominantly opposition senate , the Workersâ€ ™ party leader said she had withstood torture in her fight for democracy and would not back down even though she is widely expected to lose a final impeachment vote likely to occur within the next two days .
â€œI fought against dictatorship .
I have the mark of torture on my body ,
â€ �
she reminded senators of the abuse she suffered during imprisonment by the military government .
â€œAt almost 70 years of age , itâ€ ™ s not going to be now , after becoming a mother and grandmother , that I will abandon the principles that have always guided me.â€
�
Her comparison with the military tribunals that condemned her to prison more than 40 years ago was in keeping with the suspended presidentâ€ ™ s consistent claim throughout the nearly 10-month impeachment debate that she is the victim of a coup .
Opponents , however , used the question - and - answer session to assert their claim that Rousseff is undergoing a constitutionally approved trial overseen by the supreme court to assess whether she committed a â€œcrime of responsibilityâ€ � by putty - filling government accounts ahead of the last election .
Now nearing its end , the protracted political trial has paralysed government , overshadowed the buildup to the Olympics , and undermined efforts to reverse the alarming decline of Latin Americaâ€ ™ s biggest economy .
Although many Brazilians are tired of the squabbles in BrasÃ­lia , historians are likely to look back on todayâ€ ™ s session in the senate as a key moment in the ousting of the Workersâ€ ™ party , which is about to be thrown out of power despite never losing a presidential election since 2002 .
As the presidentâ€ ™ s motorcade left the PalÃ¡cio da Alvorada in the morning , several hundred supporters lined the roads bearing banners condemning the illegality of impeachment .
As Rousseff entered the legislative building , allies chanted : â€œOlÃª , OlÃª , OlÃª , OlÃ ¡ , Dilma Dilma.â€
�
The floor had been packed for the arrival of Rousseff , but there were just as many eyes on her invited guests who showed their support by filling out the media gallery .
Among them was former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , who barely changed his steely forward - facing stare throughout the speech .
He sat beside musical legend Chico Buarque â€ “ a prominent critic of impeachment â€ “ who caused a commotion when he arrived as senators and staff flurried to take photos .
Rousseff followed soon after with little ceremony and , as the hearing began , a hush descended on the chamber that was broken only by the chatter of camera shutters as the president waved and smiled from the bench while she was introduced by the chief justice of the supreme court , Ricardo Lewandowski , who is presiding over the trial in the senate .
In her 40-minute statement , Rousseff serenely proclaimed her innocence and struck a tone which oscillated between that of a defiant warrior defending social rights and a victimised woman wronged by her usurpers .
She reminded senators that during the inauguration of her second term in January 2015 , she had promised to respect the constitution , observe the laws and carry out a mandate given to her by 54 million voters â€ “ a majority .
But she also acknowledged that she had her flaws and that her government had been hurt by economic crises and political instability worsened by her opponents .
Later , for perhaps the first time in this process , Rousseff appeared to choke up as she recounted Workersâ€ ™ party achievements â€ “ the expansion of welfare payments , increased access to higher education , a rise in the minimum wage , development of offshore oilfields and the hosting of the World Cup and the Olympics .
It was unclear whether this pause was from emotion or fatigue , but supporters cheered their encouragement as she paused to sip water .
â€œNo demonstrations please , â€ � came a reprimand from the public address system , in a tone more respectful than earlier episodes in the impeachment process .
The anti - Rousseff camp in the senate was keen to avoid the boisterously triumphant scenes witnessed when the lower house voted for impeachment in April , and to minimise the impression that the countryâ€ ™ s first female president is a victim .
But that will be hard to do , as Rousseff has lived in the shadow of an impeachment threat for more than a year .
Mondayâ€ ™ s debate also set the stage for the next presidential election in 2018 .
As the president spoke , her predecessor and mentor Lula â€ “ who faces a criminal trial for corruption and obstruction of justice
â€ “ looked pensive .
Like Rousseff , he denies the charges against him , which he believes have been trumped up by political enemies to prevent him from running again .
But the Workersâ€ ™ party will try to rally around the sense of injustice many feel about the forced demise of its leaders .
Rousseff may be wounded , perhaps beyond recovery , but she used her speech to maul some of those who brought her down .
â€œEverybody knows this impeachment process opened with explicit blackmail by the former head of the lower house , Eduardo Cunha , â€ �
she said , noting that her accusers are themselves accused of more serious crimes .
Although she did not mention the interim president , Michel Temer , by name , she implicitly condemned her former running mate as a â€œusurperâ€ � who stole her office in a â€œcoupâ€ � that bypassed direct elections .
â€œAs is typical of authoritarian elites , they do not see the will of the people as the source of legitimacy .
They want power at any price ,
â€ �
she said .
There were broadsides too for Temerâ€ ™ s appointment of an all - male , all white cabinet , despite the fact that the electorate had chosen a woman to lead them .
As the president concluded her speech with a call for senators to vote against impeachment and for democracy , supporters on the floor briefly erupted in applause and cheers of â€œDilma , guerreira do povo
brasileiroâ€ � , ( â€œDilma , the warrior of the Brazilian peopleâ€ � ) , while her opponents sat in silence .
A question - and - answer session followed .
The first to have five minutes at the microphone was the former agriculture minister KÃ¡tia Abreu â€ “ a loyal supporter â€ “ who expressed her conviction that Rousseff was innocent and wrongly accused .
Humberto Costa , the leader of the Workersâ€ ™ party in the upper house , said he hoped this would be remembered as a â€œday of redemptionâ€ � .
But the vast majority of those who posed questions or made statements were critical of Rousseffâ€ ™ s leadership and said she was being removed as a result of due constitutional process .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t a coup , itâ€ ™ s democracy in evolution , â€ � claimed Senator JosÃ © Medeiros , who blamed the current turmoil in Brazil on Rousseffâ€ ™ s government .
â€œYou call this process a coup ?
The supreme court presides over this session .
Is the chief justice a coup - monger?â€ � asked Ricardo FerraÃ§o of the Social Democratic party of Brazil .
Rousseff is being impeached for window - dressing government accounts ahead of the last election , by issuing decrees on spending without congressional approval and waiting several months to reimburse a state - owned bank for a low - interest financing scheme for family farmers .
Senators have to judge whether this is a â€œcrime of responsibilityâ€ � that merits removal from office .
But Rousseffâ€ ™ s lawyers argue the charge is more political than legal .
Similar fiscal irregularities went unpunished in previous national and regional administrations , but these were being used as a pretext to remove a leader who had struggled to assert her authority .
Prominent senators â€ “ close to Temer â€ “ have also been secretly recorded plotting to remove Rousseff in the hope that it will kill off a wide - ranging corruption investigation â€ “ known as Lava Jato ( Car Wash )
â€ “ that has implicated many of them in a kickback scheme involving the state - run oil company Petrobras .
Allies said there was little chance the president would survive the final impeachment vote .
At the start of the senate process in May , opponents had already secured more than the two - thirds of the 81 votes they will need to remove the president from office .
There has been no evident progress in changing minds since then .
Senator Otto Alencar , of the Social Democratic party ( PSD ) from the north - eastern state of Bahia , revealed he would vote against the presidentâ€ ™ s impeachment but said few would be swayed by Rousseffâ€ ™ s speech .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no crime of responsibility .
If sheâ€ ™ s ousted , sheâ€ ™ ll be ousted for political and administrative errors .
Sheâ€
™ s an honest woman.â€
� he said .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think anyone will change their minds â€ “ Iâ€ ™ ll vote with Dilma
but I think my vote will be a vote for a lost cause.â€ �"
2016-08-31,"Brazilâ€ ™ s first female president Dilma Rousseff has been thrown out of office by the countryâ€ ™ s corruption - tainted senate after a gruelling impeachment trial that ends 13 years of Workersâ€ ™ party rule .
Following a crushing 61 to 20 defeat in the upper house , she will be replaced for the remaining two years and four months of her term by Michel Temer , a centre - right patrician who was among the leaders of the campaign against his former running mate .
In a separate vote , the senate voted 42 to 36 not to bar Rousseff from public office for eight years .
In his first address to the nation after being sworn in by Congress last night , Temer said it was time to unite the country , vowing to work to rescue an economy mired in recession and guarantee political stability for foreign investors .
Rousseff was defiant after being ousted .
â€œThey think theyâ€ ™ ve defeated us , but theyâ€ ™ re wrong , â€ �
she said from her official residency , her voice cracking and eyes moist with emotion .
â€œI know we will all fight.â€ �
Despite never losing an election , Rousseff â€ “ who first won power in 2010
â€ “ had seen her support among the public and in congress diminish as a result of a sharp economic decline , government paralysis and a massive bribery scandal that has implicated almost all the major parties .
For more than 10 months , the leftist leader fought efforts to impeach her for frontloading funds for government social programmes and issuing spending budget decrees without congressional approval ahead of her reelection in 2014 .
The opposition claimed that these constituted a â€œcrime of responsibilityâ€ � .
Rousseff denies this and claims the charges â€ “ which were never levelled at previous administrations who did the same thing â€ “ have been trumped up by opponents who were unable to accept the Workersâ€ ™ partyâ€ ™ s victory .
Speaking to her supporters from the presidential palace after the vote , Rousseff pledged to appeal her impeachment , which she called a parliamentary coup .
The ousted president also called on her supporters to fight the conservative agenda now bolstered by her removal from office .
â€œRight now , I will not say goodbye to you .
I am certain I can say ,
â€˜See you soon ,
â€ ™ â€ �
she told supporters in Brasilia .
In keeping with her pledge to fight until the end for the 54 million voters who put her in office , Rousseff â€ “ a former Marxist guerrilla â€
“ ended her presidency this week with a gritty 14-hour defence of her governmentâ€ ™ s achievements and a sharply worded attack on the â€œusurpersâ€ � and â€œcoup - mongersâ€ � who ejected her from power without an election .
Her lawyer , JosÃ © Eduardo Cardozo , said the charges were trumped up to punish the presidentâ€ ™ s support for a huge corruption investigation that has snared many of Brazilâ€ ™ s elite .
This follows secret recordings of Romero JucÃ ¡ , the majority leader of the senate and a key Temer ally , plotting to remove the president to halt the Lava Jato ( car wash ) investigation into kickbacks at state oil company Petrobras .
While Rousseff was in the upper chamber , her critics heard her in respectful silence .
But in a final session in her absence on Tuesday , they lined up to condemn her .
As in an earlier lower house impeachment debate , the senators â€ “ many of whom are accused of far greater crimes â€ “ clearly revelled in the spotlight of their ten - minute declarations .
Reflecting the growing power of rightwing evangelism , many invoked the name of God .
One cited Winston Churchill .
Another sang .
Another appeared to be in tears .
â€œI apologise to the president , not for having done what did , because I could not have done anything else , but because I know her situation is not easy , â€ � claimed a sobbing JanaÃ­na Paschoal , one of the original co - authors of the impeachment petition .
â€œI think she understands I did all this in consideration of her grandchildren.â€
�
The result was never in doubt , though Workersâ€ ™ party figurehead and former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva â€ “ who also faces a trial of his own â€ “ had lobbied hard until the last moment to try to swing enough senators to avoid impeachment .
At the end of the marathon 16-hour session of speeches , the final nail was hammered in by the former Brazilian footballer RomÃ¡rio , who had been rumoured to be among the few senators who might change their minds and save the president .
Instead , he wound up the debate by confirming that he would once again vote for impeachment .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a sad moment when you decide to remove a president , â€ � he told the chamber .
However he said he was convinced that Rousseff had committed a crime of responsibility .
Ahead of the verdict , senator Vanessa Grazziotin , of the Communist Party of Brazil , arrived with a sense of resignation .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve worn a mixture of red [ for the Workersâ€ ™ party ] and black because today is a day of mourning ,
â€ � she said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to cry.â€ �
However , she and other Rousseff allies hoped they could minimise Rousseffâ€ ™ s punishment .
Workersâ€ ™ party senator Lindbergh Farias said the presidentâ€ ™ s accusers were cowards .
â€œItâ€ ™ s amazing how everyone who didnâ€ ™ t have the gall to look Dilma in the eyes , spoke so bravely today in her absence , â€ � he tweeted .
The final result was comfortably more than the two - thirds ( 54 seats ) needed to finalise the presidentâ€ ™ s removal from office .
Shortly after 1.30pm , suspense filled the floor as senators watched as the upper house reached a quorum .
Among the last to vote was the Workers Partyâ€ ™ s
Jorge Viana as a hush fell across the packed room .
There were cheers of â€œBrazil!â€ � from the pro - impeachment camp as the numbers flashed up on the screen before a group of senators burst into a rendition of the national anthem .
There were modest exchanges of â€œcongratulationsâ€ � and backslapping between impeachment supporters as JucÃ ¡
, who was drawn into the Lava Jato corruption scandal , said he was â€œrelievedâ€
� by the result .
Edison Lobao , of the PMDB , who voted for Rousseffâ€ ™ s ouster , said : â€œI couldnâ€ ™ t have voted differently regardless of who was the president .
I would have voted for the impeachment of any president who acted outside the law.â€ �
The musician and democracy activist Chico Buarque , who was among Rousseffâ€ ™ s supporters in the gallery , said the debate was rigged against her .
â€œIf the game were clean , she would have won , â€ �
he told local media .
Others noted that Rousseffâ€ ™ s removal from office less than halfway through her mandate reinforced the impression that the countryâ€ ™ s political class remains uncomfortable with democracy although more than 30 years have passed since the end of Brazilâ€ ™ s military dictatorship .
Only two of the last eight directly - elected presidents have completed their terms .
Two have been impeached , one removed in a military coup , one killed himself , one died before taking power and another resigned .
It also marks a dramatic downfall of a woman who was once one of the worldâ€ ™ s most popular politicians with approval ratings of 85 % .
But she had struggled with a hostile congress and a dire financial climate .
When Rousseff took office in January 2011 , the economy was growing at a quarterly clip of 4.9 % .
It has been downhill ever since and she leaves the presidency with output shrinking by 4.6 % though this is partly because the price of Brazilâ€ ™ s oil exports is now below half of its peak in 2011 .
Rousseffâ€ ™ s
achievements in office were mainly an expansion of equality policies put in place by her predecessors , particularly the bolsa familia poverty relief program , which now reaches almost 14 million households .
Thanks to affirmative action and wider access to higher education , university enrolments jumped 18 % during her first term .
Since 2009 , 2.6 million homes have been delivered by the government housing program â€ “
Minha Casa Minha Vida .
But her record in other key areas is mixed .
After falling in her first two years in power , deforestation of the Amazon has started to rise again .
Her replacement has a lot to do .
Temer â€ “ who was widely criticised for appointing an all - male , all - white cabinet when he took power on an interim basis in May â€ “ was sworn in again on Wednesday afternoon and is set to continue until the next presidential election in 2018 , when he has promised he will not stand .
After being sworn in , Temer promised a â€œnew eraâ€ � for Brazil during a televised cabinet meeting .
â€œFrom today on , the expectations are much higher for the government .
I hope that in these two years and four months , we do what we have declared â€ “ put Brazil back on track , â€ �
he said .
Regarding his upcoming trip to China , he said it was important to show that stability had returned .
â€œWe are traveling precisely to reveal to the world that we have political and legal stability , â€ � he said .
â€œWe have to show that there is hope in the country.â€ �
Temer received support from the United States , which implicitly rejected claims that Rousseff had been removed in a coup .
US State Department spokesman , John Kirby said , â€œWe are confident we will continue our strong bilateral relationship .
This was a decision made by the Brazilian people and obviously we respect that ...
Brazilian democratic institutions have acted within its constitutional framework.â€ �
Shortly after the ceremony , he is due to fly to China to attend the G20 summit in Hangzhou , where he will hope to restore some of the credibility of an administration that has been battered by accusations of treachery and three ministerial resignations due to corruption scandals .
He has promised to introduce austerity measures that will restore Brazilâ€ ™ s credit ratings , which under Rousseff fell to junk levels .
This is popular with investors , but not with the public .
His approval ratings are only a fraction above those of his predecessor and he was roundly booed during the Olympic opening ceremony .
During the final stages of the senate trial , there was no repeat of the mass rallies in Brasilia that marked earlier stages of the process .
However , a small group of Rousseff supporters staged a candlelit vigil in the main esplanade .
Bigger protests have been seen in other cities this week .
In SÃ£o Paulo anti - impeachment protesters and riot police clashed on Monday night .
Demonstrators claim the security forces made excessive use of tear gas and percussion grenades in what they fear will be a precursor of more clampdowns on opposition .
Police claimed the protesters â€ “ many from the Landless Workersâ€ ™
Movement â€ “ blocked roads and detonated a home - made bomb .

2016-08-31,"Brazilâ€ ™ s senate voted to oust Dilma Rousseff from the presidency on Wednesday , following an impeachment process that has seen her suspended from office since May.
Sixty - one senators , seven more than the two - thirds needed , backed her removal from office , confirming interim president Michel Temer as the countryâ€ ™ s leader .
How bad is the crisis ?
On a scale of one to 10 , it has felt to many Brazilians like an 11 .
Rousseff , the most recent president , was impeached , the previous president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva is about to stand trial , the economy is in the midst of its greatest slump for decades , and swaths of the political class have been implicated in the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) corruption investigation .
What is Lava Jato ?
Depending on your politics , it is either a clean broom sweeping out decades of rotten politicians or part of a conspiracy to end 13 years of Workers party rule without an election .
Starting in 2008 but ramping up in 2014 , federal police , prosecutors and judges have uncovered a multibillion - dollar kickback and bribery scandal at the state - run oil firm Petrobras , the biggest company in Latin America until the scandal hit .
Essentially , contracts were inflated so up to 3 % of funds could be channelled to the three parties that previously formed a ruling coalition : the Workers party , the Democratic Movement party of Brazil ( PMDB ) and the Progressive party .
The probe , however , has widened to include other parties and other projects , including the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam .
Some predict it will lead to the greatest jailing of lawmakers in world history .
What has been the impact on the country ?
The scandal has paralysed the government because bribes were essential for building coalitions .
It has also choked business because prosecutors ordered the suspension of contracts between Petrobras and its major suppliers , which included almost all of the countryâ€ ™ s biggest construction and shipping firms .
In more than two years , 61 % of Petrobrasâ€ ™ 276,000 employees have lost their jobs , according to local media .
Many smaller firms that depended on its business have been made bankrupt .
Many believe this pain will be worthwhile if the investigation leads to punishment of all corrupt politicians and sets the stage for a new era of clean government .
But that future is a long way off , if it comes at all .
Why do Brazilian parties need slush funds ?
Politicians all over the world need campaign finance , but it is particularly important in Brazil due to the countryâ€ ™ s vast size , plethora of parties , three levels of government ( with regular elections for municipal , state and national leaders and legislators ) and an open - list election system for lawmakers .
No single party has ever come close to a commanding majority in Congress , so support is bought with cabinet posts and/or cash .
Who is making the accusations ?
The investigation is nationwide , but the charge is being led by judicial figures in the southern city of Curitiba .
Most influential among them is Judge Sergio Moro , who has become something of a cult figure for his willingness to take on the countryâ€ ™ s most powerful politicians and business people .
Other prominent figures include Curitiba prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol and police chief Igor Romario de Paula .
Not everyone thinks they are heroes .
Some lawyers claim their extensive use of preventative detentions and plea bargains rides roughshod over fundamental civil rights , including the presumption of innocence .
Who is accused ?
Prosecutors claim former president da Silva ( better known as Lula ) was the ringleader of the scheme , though he denies breaking any law and says the charges against him are trumped up to prevent him running for office again in 2018 .
Others implicated include former house speaker Eduardo Cunha ( PMDB ) ; the head of the Senate , Renan Calheiros ( PMDB ) ; and senior politicians from almost every party .
In addition , many leading businessman have been jailed , including Marcelo Odebrecht , the head of the countryâ€ ™ s biggest construction company , and billionaire banker Andre Esteves .
Foreign firms , including the UK - based Rolls Royce , have also been accused of making pay - offs .
Is Dilma Rousseff implicated in the Lava Jato scandal ?
Not directly .
Prosecutors have found no evidence that she was involved and even her enemies acknowledge that she is one of the few politicians in Brazil not to accept bribes .
However , it is widely assumed that Rousseff must have known what was going on because she was a former energy minister and chief of staff at the height of the wrongdoing .
Many of her confidants have been arrested or are on trial .
Whether she was aware of what was going on or not , she benefited from the campaign funds and failed to halt the corruption .
Prosecutors allege she also tried to obstruct their investigation and protect her ally Lula by appointing him to the cabinet .
Is that why Rousseff was being impeached ?
Only partly , and for all the wrong reasons .
Rousseff has ostensibly been thrown out of office because she window - dressed government accounts ahead of the last presidential election .
The charge is that her government filled holes in its accounts by taking loans from state banks without congressional approval .
Opponents say this creative accounting â€ “ accounting sleights of hand known as â€œpedaladasâ€ �
( pedalling )
â€ “ allowed the administration to fund a program for family farmers using money that was not reimbursed until several months later , bypassing Congress , creating a misleading impression of state finances and adding to economic instability .
In her defence , Rousseff said the money was not a loan because it was simply being transferred through the state banks from public coffers .
Similar practices had also been used by previous administrations , though not at the same scale .
But this is a pretext .
The real reasons for impeachment are political .
Rousseff is enormously unpopular because she is blamed for the multiple crises facing the country and has proved an inept leader .
But Brazilâ€ ™ s constitution does not allow a no - confidence vote to eject her from office so her enemies are using impeachment to do the job .
Some are clearly motivated by a desire to kill the Lava Jato investigation , which Rousseff refused to do .
The impeachment process was initiated by Cunha after the Workers party refused to protect him from an ethics committee investigation .
Secretly recorded conversations have also revealed that the PMDB leader in the Senate , Romero JucÃ ¡ , wanted to remove the president so the Lava Jato investigation could be choked by her successor .
Where does that leave interim president Michel Temer ?
Rousseffâ€ ™ s
centre - right successor is almost as despised as his predecessor after helping lead the campaign to bring down his running mate , then naming an all - male , all - white cabinet and losing three ministers to the Lava Jato scandal in his first month in office .
At the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Rio , Temer was such an embarrassment that his speech was cut to 10 seconds but still drowned out by boos .
He is surrounded by politicians implicated in the corruption scandal and â€ “ as leader of Brazilâ€
™ s biggest party â€ “ he too has benefited from dubiously acquired campaign financing .
How has the public reacted ?
Polls and street demonstration suggest voters are sick not just of the government , but almost all politicians .
In March , an estimated 3 million people joined rallies against Rousseffâ€ ™ s government .
Since then hundreds of thousands have demonstrated for or against impeachment .
But none of the alternatives are popular .
Temerâ€ ™ s administration has ratings in the low teens .
Lulaâ€ ™ s popularity is higher , but he is also hated by more people .
The biggest beneficiary might eventually be former environment minister Marina Silva , a losing candidate in the last two presidential campaigns .
Where does Brazil go from here ?
In a best - case scenario , the economy will pick up next year and Lava Jato will purge the nationâ€ ™ s political canker , allowing Latin Americaâ€ ™ s biggest nation to concentrate more effectively on social equality , sustainable development and regional integration .
Alternatively , the old hierarchy will quietly shelve Lava Jato once Lula and Rousseff are out of the way and restore the conservative policies of the past ; or even open the way â€ “ as in Italy after the Clean Hands investigation â€ “ for a Silvio Berlusconi - like right - wing populist ."
2016-08-31,"The impeachment of Dilma Rousseff is not just the story of one woman , who in her youth bravely fought dictatorship , rose to become president and has now been ushered from power amid an unprecedented country - wide corruption scandal .
It is also the story of a nation : South Americaâ€ ™ s largest country , once applauded for its growing influence and its fight against poverty , now struggling with political tensions that have up - ended the 13-year rule of its Workersâ€ ™ party ( brought to prominence by Ms Rousseffâ€ ™ s charismatic predecessor and mentor , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva ) .
It is equally a tale of todayâ€ ™ s shifting global landscape , in which powers that just years ago were celebrated as â€œemergingâ€ � and likely to reshape the world find themselves confronted by difficulties rooted in economic downturns and flawed governance .
Brazilâ€ ™ s senate voted 61 to 20 for her removal today .
That her ousting had the hallmarks of a personal tragedy is hard to dispute .
There were tears and shows of anger , as Ms Rousseff put up an epic fight against what she and her supporters have consistently called a â€œcoupâ€ � , but her many critics described as the logical outcome of a long , constitutional process aimed at clearing the graft and unaccountability that have too long dominated Brazilian politics .
Emotions were high as Ms Rousseff drew parallels with the way she had endured torture under Brazilâ€ ™ s military dictatorship .
â€œI wonâ€ ™ t abandon the principles that have guided me , â€ �
she said .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t a coup , itâ€ ™ s democracy in evolution , â€ � one opposition senator answered back .
It is hard to overlook a degree of unfairness in this brutal downfall : Ms Rousseff never stood accused of personally benefiting from corruption ( she was on trial for window - dressing state budget figures ) , unlike dozens of Brazilian officials and politicians â€ “ many of whom voted for her removal .
That the crisis has come to this cathartic moment says perhaps as much about an â€œevolvingâ€ � democracy as about the cynicism of some of its elites , much exposed by the Petrobras and Lavo Jato corruption investigations .
This has been a downwards slide for Brazil .
In 2010 , when Ms Rousseff was first elected , Brazil was the seventh - largest economy in the world and widely recognised as a power on the rise .
It wanted to display its accomplishments as host of the 2014 World Cup and this summerâ€ ™ s Olympic Games .
Its successes in reducing inequalities made it a model for the global south .
But the collapse of commodity prices halted a decade - long export boom â€ “ and social tensions , mass street demonstrations ( triggered by bus fare rises in 2013 ) and popular discontent , including among the new middle classes , emerged .
That the opposition to her Workersâ€ ™ party capitalised on these frustrations is unsurprising .
But to say Brazilâ€ ™ s rightwing forces emerged looking â€œcleanerâ€ � than the government when financial dealings and vast political kickback schemes were uncovered would be a stretch of the imagination .
Brazilâ€ ™ s crisis in some ways resembles those of other â€œdevelopingâ€ � countries where governance issues and economic setbacks have led to political tensions : witness the difficulties of
South Africaâ€ ™ s ANC or the anti - corruption campaigns waged by Chinaâ€ ™ s autocratic leader .
None of this can be a consolation for Ms Rousseff , nor will it erase the mistakes she made as a leader .
But to ascribe all of Brazilâ€ ™ s ills to one woman , or think they will disappear with one vote , would be both simplistic and disingenuous .
Many of those happy to see her thrown from office are the very people who hope that , as a result , they will be spared the attention of anti - corruption judges .
Brazil is now a highly polarised nation and its citizens are deeply divided , but they want a political class that can restore the public confidence needed to address the countryâ€ ™ s many challenges .
Whether the new president Michel Temer â€ “ who had led the attacks against Ms Rousseff â€ “ can deliver on those expectations is the next daunting question ."
2016-09-01,"The vote that sealed Michel Temerâ€ ™ s installation into power in Brazil took place precisely one week after the end of the Rio Olympic Games and just days before the G20 summit .
Major disturbances were avoided during the Games and the new president was confirmed in his post just in time to take his flight and enjoy a convenient round of handshakes and photos with world leaders in China .
Everything was carefully planned to make the arbitrary removal of a democratically elected president look like business as usual .
Thatâ€ ™ s not to say the new leadership in Brazil isnâ€ ™ t worried about whether it appears legitimate .
Over the past few months , the alliance forged to oust Dilma Rousseff rejected calling the impeachment process that it was sponsoring a coup dâ€ ™ Ã © tat .
Some even threatened to take legal action against those making this claim in official debates .
Their narrative insisted that constitutional procedures were observed .
It is true that , unlike the sudden impeachment carried out after just a couple of days in Paraguay in 2012 , or the clear use of force in Honduras in 2009 , formalities were observed in the surreal trial of Rousseff .
For over five months alleged government accounting irregularities were treated as one of the most serious crimes in Brazilian political history and were carefully analysed by zealous legislators , including some accused of many crimes themselves , ranging from corruption to money laundering .
Suddenly the same country that was capable of silently coping with a routine of impunity in notorious cases of state violence , such as the mass murder of street children or landless workers , became fixated on the legality of administrative budgeting orders .
Irrespective of such bizarre and creative legal analysis , Rousseffâ€ ™ s fate was decided long before the last vote in the senate , by the collapse of the heterogeneous coalition that sustained her government and that made her the easy prey of an ultra - conservative legislature rattled by uncontrolled corruption investigations .
This transition sheds light on the structural weaknesses of Brazilâ€ ™ s democracy .
The conservative congressmen who led the process of impeachment had been , in fact , key supporters of Rousseff , and of all other presidents of Brazil since the end of the dictatorship in 1985 .
Without their support , government majority in parliament would be impossible .
With the arrival of Temer to the top post , this collection of ultra - conservative and corrupt forces has finally achieved hegemonic control over the executive and legislative branches .
Even with the careful re - arrangement of forces in the parliament and the enthusiastic support of the Brazilian mainstream media ( often controlled by politicians ) , it is hard to believe that Temer will enjoy the same calm mood he should now meet in China .
Judicial investigations of corruption are still ongoing and threaten Temer personally and his most direct allies , and political polarisation remains at an all - time high in Brazil .
The impeachment of Rousseff will leave deep scars in political and institutional life .
Not only will the country be headed by an artificial leadership arrangement ; the new coalition comes to power imposing a radical turn to the right which was defeated in four previous elections .
Law reforms are to be pushed through by the new leadership to undermine laws protecting workers and severely restricting mandatory expenditure in health and education over the next decades as the magical solution to restore global trust in the countryâ€ ™ s economy .
Parliament is also on the verge of concluding a stream of measures undermining rights in critical areas such as the defence of indigenous lands and the environment , as well as threatening sexual and reproductive rights .
The Brazilian crisis is not unique .
Perhaps as a late consequence of the global economic debacle of 2008 , mainstream political forces in all regions are now dealing with very high levels of dissatisfaction and battling strident voices and movements .
In some places , this new wave is resulting in violence and serious damage to the rule of law and democracy .
In Brazil it is clear that the combined economic and political crisis is offering a golden opportunity for an ultra - conservative alliance to regain control of power and demolish part of the legacy of the brief democratic experience .
Such a dramatic ending of what was once believed to be one of the very few positive experiences of pragmatic left leadership in the global south will certainly resonate beyond its borders , particularly in Latin America .
The tasks of promoting democracy and human rights in an extremely unequal society are far more complex than Brazil once made the world believe ."
2016-09-13,"Brazilâ€ ™ s political bloodletting claimed another high - profile victim on Monday when the lower house voted to expel its former speaker Eduardo Cunha for perjury , corruption and obstruction of justice .
The wily evangelical politician â€ “ often described as the Frank Underwood of Brazil â€ “ was the orchestrator of the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff , but less than two weeks after his enemy was expelled from office , he too has been cast aside by the chamber he once dominated .
Cunhaâ€ ™ s overwhelming defeat â€
“ by 450 votes to 10 with nine abstentions
â€ “ strips him of parliamentary immunity and may be followed by criminal charges for his involvement in the bribery and kickback scandal at state - oil company Petrobras .
He has also been banned from politics for eight years , a punishment more severe than that of Rousseff , who was ejected from office but maintains her political rights .
In his final speech to the house , Cunha insisted he had been sacrificed for political rather than legal reasons , and warned that others were likely to follow .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the price Iâ€ ™ m paying for the country to be free of the Workers party .
They are charging me the price for leading the impeachment process , â€ � he told lawmakers .
â€œTomorrow , it will be you.â€ �
It is not the first veiled threat Cunha has made in a career built on his knowledge of other politiciansâ€ ™ secrets and enhanced by his control over campaign pursestrings .
This made him a powerful politician , but he was also feared by his peers and reviled by the public .
When the result was announced just before midnight , some politicians made prison bars with their fingers and there were chants of â€œFora Cunha!â€ � ( â€œCunha out!â€ � ) in the chamber , which less than six months ago rang with praise from his supporters after he oversaw the first impeachment vote against Rousseff .
But since then the two adversaries have slugged each other to the floor .
Cunha was forced to resign the speakerâ€ ™ s chair in July while he came under investigation by the ethics committee for abuse of power and other charges .
At the time , former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso noted : â€œCunha was very functional in destroying Dilma ; now he is being destroyed.â€ �
Now Cunha has also been thrown out of his congressional seat , despite claims of innocence that will next have to be addressed to police .
In echoes of Rousseff , Cunha claimed he was the victim of a political conspiracy and laid part of the blame on the media , especially the powerful Globo media group .
Public anger has been stirred by reports that Cunha stashed around $ 1.3 m in illegal kickbacks in a secret Swiss bank account , that he intimidated opponents and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle that was far beyond the means of his declared annual income of $ 120,000 .
Ahead of the vote on Monday , the ethics committee rapporteur Marcos Rogerio said there was indisputable evidence that Cunha had accounts in Switzerland that were â€œinstruments to conceal tax evasion , launder money and receive kickbacksâ€ � .
The money , he said , had come from an inflated purchase by Petrobras of an oil field in Benin .
Prosecutors previously leaked credit card statements showing that Cunha and his family splashed out $ 40,000 on a nine - day family holiday in Miami at the end of 2013 , then followed this with similar shopping and restaurant sprees in Paris , New York and Zurich .
Cunha and his wife also allegedly own a fleet of eight luxury cars , including a Porsche , which were registered under the name of Jesus.com and C3 Productions .
Cunha could yet take down former allies .
In recent years , he has been one of three senior figures in the ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement party ( PMDB ) , alongside current Brazilian president Michel Temer and upper house leader Renan Calheiros
â€ “ all of whom benefited from the Petrobras corruption scheme .
The former speaker appears to have been the least cautious , apparently in the belief that he could not be touched .
A trained economist , he was a protÃ
© gÃ © of Fernando Collor , the only previous president to have been impeached since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985 .
He converted to the Assembly of God â€ “ one of the countryâ€ ™ s biggest evangelical churches â€ “ and rose to notoriety as the outspoken host of a radio show on an evangelical station .
With support from the Christian right , he won his first seat in the chamber of deputies in 2003 as a representative of Rio de Janeiro , and became speaker in 2015 .
In polls , he is consistently among the most unpopular politicians in the nation .
A Datafolha survey earlier this year found 77 % of the voters wanted Cunha to be stripped of his mandate , compared with 61%-67 % for Rousseff , who was blamed for the recession , political turmoil and failing to stop corruption .
The wrath of the public appears to have weighed more heavily on lawmakers than their fear of any secrets Cunha might reveal .
Reflecting on the resounding opposition , politician Jandira Feghali noted ironically that it was â€œsadâ€ � that only two deputies came up to the microphone to defend Cunha , â€œdespite the power
he
hadâ€ � .
Another deputy , Edson Moreira , drew parallels with the French Revolution .
â€œRobespierre sent Danton to the guillotine and he [ himself ] ended up on the guillotine , â€ � he noted .
After the result was announced , Cunha said he was a victim of â€œpolitical
vengeanceâ€ � ahead of mid - term elections in October , but told reporters he was planning to publish a book of his involvement in the impeachment process .
Asked if he had recorded conversations as other politicians have done , he claimed there was no need : â€œI have a good memory.â€ �
What he chooses to remember may yet have significant repercussions .
AntÃ´nio Imbassahy of the Social Democratic party of Brazil , urged Cunha to â€œtell all he knows so he can contribute to the countryâ€ � .
If rumours of Cunhaâ€ ™ s book of secrets are to be believed , the bloodletting may yet have some way to run ."
2016-10-19,"Eduardo Cunha , the Brazilian politician who orchestrated the impeachment of the countryâ€ ™ s first female president , Dilma Rousseff , has been arrested on corruption charges .
Federal police detained the former speaker of the lower house in Brasilia on Wednesday and executed a search warrant at his home in Rio de Janeiro .
Compared by some to Frank Underwood from House of Cards , Cunha also has been accused of taking up to 116.5 m reais ( $ 37 m ) in bribes as part of the Operation Car Wash investigation into mammoth corruption at state oil giant Petrobras .
The arrest was ordered by federal judge Sergio Moro , who has gained celebrity in Brazil by leading that probe , which has ensnared dozens of leading politicians .
Moro has been investigating Cunha for months but could only arrest him after he was expelled from the chamber of deputies last month , and lost his parliamentary immunity .
â€œ[His freedom ] posed a risk to the investigation of the case , to public order , as well as the concrete possibility of that he would flee due to the availability of hidden funds abroad , in addition to his dual nationality ( Cunha is Italian and Brazilian),â€ � federal prosecutors said in a statement .
The statement quoted Moro , who said : â€œUntil there is full traceability of money , there is a greater risk that he will flee , since the accused could use illegal funds to facilitate his escape and refuge abroad.â€ �
The court order , signed by Moro on Tuesday , allows for his indefinite detention while the investigation continues .
However , he can appeal to the supreme court to be freed .
The reviled evangelical politician , 58 , played a crucial role in the impeachment of Rousseff in August .
As the speaker of the chamber of deputies , he initiated proceedings against her .
Rousseff , who was not accused of personally enriching herself , has claimed that Cunha and his allies were motivated by her refusal to shutdown Operation Car Wash. Rousseffâ€ ™ s successor , and her former vice - president , Michel Temer is of the same Brazilian Democratic Movement ( PMDB ) party as Cunha but has distanced himself .
Cunha , who built his powerbase on knowing the secrets of others , is said to be writing a book .
After his removal from congress by 450 votes to 10 , he was banned from politics for eight years , a punishment more severe than that handed to Rousseff , who was ejected from office but â€ “ in an unprecedented move
â€ “ was allowed to keep her political rights .
Cunha is now being investigated for a wide range of allegations , including taking bribes relating to Petrobras and Caixa Economica Federal , a state bank .
He is said to have stashed $ 2.3 m in Swiss bank accounts but prosecutors believe that is a fraction of the total .
Credit card statements , leaked by prosecutors , showed Cunha and his family spent out $ 40,000 on a nine - day family holiday in Miami at the end of 2013 , then went on shopping and restaurant sprees in Paris , New York and Zurich .
Cunha and his wife are also said to own a fleet of eight luxury cars , including a Porsche , which were registered under the name of Jesus.com and C3 Productions .
He originally rose to notoriety as a radio host after converting to the Assembly of God , one of Brazilâ€ ™ s biggest evangelical churches .
He was elected to congress in 2003 and became speaker in 2015 .
He is consistently one of the most disliked politicians in Brazil and â€œCunha outâ€ � has become a popular slogan , summing up widespread disgust at the political class .
Opposition politicians predicted if Cunha made a plea bargain with prosecutors , the government could fall .
â€œEduardo Cunha has just been arrested , â€ �
Lindbergh Farias of
Rousseffâ€ ™ s
Workersâ€ ™ party told the senate .
â€œAnd I sincerely hope he makes a deal .
If he makes a deal , the government of Michel Temer will not last a day.â€ �"
2016-11-11,"Brazil has been plunged into a fresh bout of political uncertainty after lawyers for former president Dilma Rousseff presented evidence suggesting her successor , Michel Temer , accepted bribes from a construction company .
If accepted the documents filed with the supreme electoral court raise the possibility of the 2014 presidential election being declared invalid due to campaign funding violations , which could force Temer from office .
The two politicians were running mates in 2014 but have since become bitter enemies .
Rousseff , of the Workers party , was impeached and removed from the presidency in September on charges of window - dressing government accounts .
She has levelled accusations of treachery at her replacement , Temer , of the centre - right Brazilian Democratic Movement party .
On Thursday her lawyers submitted bank statements and a copy of a cheque from 10 July 2014 that showed construction company Andrade Gutierrez deposited 1 m reais ( Â£234,000 ) into the PMDB general campaign fund , which was then transferred the same day into the personal campaign fund of Temer .
They said this proved that Temer should be ejected from office for receiving illegal funds and that Rousseff â€ “ who had earlier been accused by construction company executive OctÃ¡vio Azevedo of accepting the same amount on the same day â€ “ was the victim of perjury .
The PMDB insists the donation was given legally and does not constitute a bribe .
The supreme electoral court has yet to rule on the case but has already spent several months investigating allegations of financing irregularities by the 2014 Rousseff - Temer campaign .
The Temer camp have argued that Rousseff â€ “ as the head of the ticket â€ “ should take responsibility for any rule breaking .
But it has yet to be decided whether they should be judged separately or together .
Both politicians are unpopular , having jointly presided over the worst economic recession in decades and a massive corruption scandal centred on the state oil company Petrobras .
Police and prosecutors in the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) probe have implicated more than 50 senior politicians from almost all of the main parties , as well as corporate executives .
Among those accused are Eduardo Cunha â€ “ the former house speaker , who led the impeachment campaign but now languishes in prison â€ “ and three of the ministers in Temerâ€ ™ s first interim cabinet , all of whom have had to resign .
The president has also been named in several plea bargains , though he has rejected claims that he was involved in wrongdoing .
The Workers party has also seen several of its leading figures jailed â€ “ including a former treasurer and government chief of staff â€ “ and its founder , the former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , called to face trial as the alleged head of the corruption scheme .
He denies the charges .
Amid fears of fresh turmoil Brazilâ€ ™ s currency fell on Thursday by more than 5 % to its lowest level since June ."
2016-11-25,"The Brazilian president , Michel Temer , faced a crisis on Friday after a former cabinet colleague placed him directly in the line of fire of corruption allegations .
The scandal , which immediately forced the resignation of a key aide , looks set to pose the greatest challenge yet to a six - month - old administration that is also struggling with a dire recession and political turmoil which led earlier this year to the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff .
The crisis exploded when the former culture minister Marcelo Calero alleged to federal investigators that Temer put pressure on him to sidestep a heritage preservation order that was holding up construction on a tower block in the north - eastern city of Salvador .
An apartment in the luxury residence had been bought by the presidentâ€ ™ s close ally Geddel Vieira Lima , who stepped down on Friday as minister in charge of relations with Brazilâ€ ™ s congress as a result of the revelations .
Temer has denied wrongdoing , but he is now in the sights of opposition politicians , who say they will use the case to open impeachment proceedings .
Although this is unlikely to pass a congress dominated by government supporters , it could antagonise the public and complicate Temerâ€ ™ s efforts to push through a package of austerity measures .
Much is likely to depend on secret recordings that Calero reportedly made of conversations with the president .
The content has yet to be made public , but any suggestion of influence peddling could prompt the public prosecutor and supreme court to open an investigation .
The latest upheaval comes at a sensitive moment for the administration , which is planning to propose a pension reform bill as a step towards rebalancing state finances .
The measure faces fierce opposition from unions .
Brazilâ€ ™ s political system is widely seen as discredited in the wake of the Lava Jato investigation , which has implicated more than 50 senators and deputies .
Public fury has been further fuelled by recent congressional attempts to pass an amnesty bill for campaign finance violations .
Carlos Alberto de Melo of the SÃ£o Paulo - based Institute of Research and Education said Temer is already hamstrung by unpopularity and the latest allegations are grave enough to make his situation worse .
â€œThere is an agenda of unpopular reforms , and a situation of moral crisis doesnâ€ ™ t help , â€ � he said ."
2016-12-02,"Poor Brazilians have long counted on a thin welfare state for basic human rights , such as healthcare , education and social security ; but this reality may soon drastically change .
Brazilâ€ ™ s unelected president , Michel Temer , is seeking to amend the constitution to impose unprecedented austerity measures for the next two decades , effectively disenfranchising ordinary Brazilians , and especially the countryâ€ ™ s most vulnerable citizens .
Temer , formerly Dilma Rousseffâ€ ™ s ally and vice president , came to power in August as Rousseff was ousted from office in a highly controversial impeachment procedure many have called a parliamentary coup .
The country he has taken charge of is facing a serious economic crisis similar to that confronting many of Brazilâ€ ™ s neighbours ; his answer for a stagnant economy is to freeze the federal budget for decades through a constitutional amendment .
PEC 55 , as the amendment is known in Brazil , establishes that for the next 20 years , growth in annual public spending will be limited to the previous yearâ€ ™ s inflation rate , thereby freezing , in real terms , federal expenditures until 2037 at 2016 levels .
While some countries , such as Germany and the UK , have in the past resorted to expenditure rules as a mechanism to curb fiscal deficit , none of them did so through a constitutional amendment or for such an extended duration .
In all other cases , fiscal rules were enshrined in law or in a coalition agreement , leaving enough flexibility for future changes that will be nearly impossible in the Brazilian case ; here , it will take a drastic modification of the constitutional framework for the amendment to be overturned .
PEC 55 not only means that public spending on education , healthcare and social assistance will remain constant for years as the population grows and ages , but also that various interest groups will be fighting over the meagre money left over .
Quite predictably , during this arm - wrestling match , the more powerful actors , such as the judiciary and military , will be able to secure funding at the expense of public universities and the health system .
What is more , this amendment is fundamentally antidemocratic .
The scandal - ridden Temer was not elected to office , and the austere economic agenda he seeks to implement never received a mandate from the people .
As it is structured , PEC 55 is an open attack on the voting rights of the poor : no matter who they elect in the next two decades , they will have to endure under an unalterable austerity policy .
Itâ€ ™ s a case of deja vu : the new regime is making the poor pay , again , for a bill they neither participated in creating , nor will benefit from .
Itâ€ ™ s an emblematic issue in one of the most unequal countries in the world , where 25 % of the countryâ€ ™ s total income goes to the top 1 % .
Moreover , even IMF economists agree that austerity policies do more harm than good .
According to the UN economic commission for Latin America and the Caribbean , reduction of external demand for primary products coupled with deceleration of the local economies that consequently received reduced investment and consumption , are the major factors underlying the South American crisis .
Temerâ€ ™ s economic team justifies the proposed new fiscal regime by claiming that the growth of primary public spending is at the heart of the countryâ€ ™ s current economic crisis .
This is a false argument .
The real root of our fiscal problems lies in a highly unequal tax system , one that does not tax the rich proportionally and gives exemptions to the business sector , particularly on dividends for shareholders .
As the amendment process moves ahead , the authoritarian political agenda behind the proposed rolling - back of public spending is ever more apparent .
PEC 55 has already made its way through the chamber of deputies without any opposition and was approved on Tuesday in the first round , by the senate .
At least 50,000 protesters â€ “ among them students , teachers , indigenous people , landless and homeless movements , retired people and union leaders , from all around the country â€ “ congregated at the ministry - lined central esplanade of BrasÃ­lia in an attempt to bar the voting .
They were met with teargas , pepper spray and rubber bullets , leaving at least 40 people injured and many more detained .
While the legislative process has thus far been alarmingly expedient and without much substantial deliberation , the warlike scene outside parliament last night provided a glimpse of the tremendous impact of this counter - reform on Brazilâ€ ™ s already weakened democracy .
With this move , Temer is fulfilling the promise he made after replacing Rousseff â€ “ namely , to implement severe cuts on social programmes and propel an extensive privatisation plan .
If there was no coup against Rousseff , as some still insist , it is now hard to deny the ongoing coup against the poor , and , indeed , against democracy itself ."
2016-12-09,"Brazil is poised to implement the most socially regressive austerity package in the world , a senior United Nations official has warned .
Despite violent street protests against budget cuts , President Michel Temer â€ “ who came to power after engineering the impeachment of his former running mate , Dilma Rousseff â€ “ is pushing through a 20-year social spending freeze that will be locked into the constitution .
Ahead of a final senate vote on the measures next Tuesday , the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights , Philip Alston , took the unusual step of decrying the plan as an attack on the poor â€ “ and a violation of Brazilâ€ ™ s obligations under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .
â€œThis is a radical measure , lacking in all nuance and compassion , â€ � he said in a statement on Friday .
â€œIt is completely inappropriate to freeze only social expenditure and to tie the hands of all future governments for another two decades .
If this amendment is adopted it will place Brazil in a socially retrogressive category all of its own.â€
�
The constitutional amendment , which is known as PEC55 , solidifies fears that Temerâ€ ™ s rightwing government will jerk Brazil back towards its historical position as one of the most unequal countries on the planet .
That reputation had somewhat softened after 13 years of Workersâ€ ™ party rule , which saw increased spending on healthcare and education , and modest income distribution measures .
But since Temer conspired to eject Rousseff from the presidency , he has switched priorities towards creditors in an effort to restore investor confidence and improve Brazilâ€ ™ s battered financial ratings .
As a result the state will shrink rapidly and a greater share of tax revenues will go to bond holders .
PEC55 goes far further than austerity policies in other nations , according to Pedro Paulo Zahluth Bastos , associate professor in economics at the University of Campinas .
Bastos notes that only Singapore and Georgia hard - wired cuts into their constitutions â€ “ and even then not so deeply or for such a duration .
Given how inflation is benchmarked , he estimates education spending per child will fall by almost a third , and health outlays per patient will decrease by almost 10 % .
While social spending declines as a share of GDP , he says the demands will increase because of an ageing society and the forecast addition of 20 million people to the population .
Yet interest payments will remain generous : all future gains in taxation will be destined to the payment of public debt .
And Brazil will remain one of the only countries in the world without a dividend tax or an income tax for company owners .
â€œNothing like this has been executed in any other place in the world ,
â€ �
Bastos said .
â€œThis is the most contractionist state and at the same time the most beneficial program for the holders of public debt in the history of humanity.â€ �
There has been little public debate considering the importance of a measure that will affect the country until 2037 .
Polls suggest less than half of the population have heard of PEC55 .
None of them voted for it because Temer was elected vice - president in 2014 on Rousseffâ€ ™ s coattails and a promise of no austerity .
Adding to frustrations , the government remains mired in a corruption scandal with dozens of senior politicians implicated in the ongoing Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigation into bribery and kickbacks at the state run oil company Petrobras .
Three ministers have resigned from the cabinet of Temer , who is also accused .
To public fury , the head of the upper house , Renan Calheiros , refused to comply with a supreme court judgeâ€ ™ s ruling that he step down to answer charges earlier this week , and has subsequently struck a deal with other justices that enables him to cling to power .
Social tensions are already evident .
Police used teargas and rubber bullets when more than 10,000 protesters rallied outside Congress during an earlier stage of voting on the bill .
Local government budget cuts and salary delays have also prompted violent demonstrations on other cities .
The latest erupted in central Rio de Janeiro on Monday , when office workers and shoppers got caught up in clashes between riot police and striking firemen , police and other state employees .
â€œWe are losing jobs and incomes so we have a right to protest , but the government responds with violence , â€ � said Pedro Oliveira , as teargas swirled through the city streets .
Jorge Darze , the president of the Doctorâ€ ™ s Union of Rio de Janeiro , said he was worried both by the cuts to an already underfunded health system and the breakdown of dialogue between social organisations and the authorities .
â€œThe situation is very serious , â€ � he warned .
â€œIt is very difficult to discuss , because the legislative militarises its entrance and the public prosecutors office has turned its back .
This austerity package is far from solving the economic crisis , and I think it will worsen the social crisis.â€ �"
2016-12-12,"Brazilâ€ ™ s president , Michel Temer , is facing allegations that he solicited Â£2.3 m ( $ 2.9 m ) in illegal campaign donations in 2014 , further weakening the position of a deeply unpopular leader .
In a poll published Sunday but carried out before the new accusations surfaced , 63 % of Brazilians said they wanted Temer to resign for new elections .
A judge on Brazilâ€ ™ s highest electoral court told the Guardian that the accusations â€ “ which Temer denies â€ “ could form part of an ongoing investigation into whether bribe money helped fund the 2014 campaign that saw Dilma Rousseff re - elected president with Temer as her running mate .
That could even lead to him losing his mandate .
Temer took over as president earlier this year after Rousseff was ousted in a controversial impeachment process she and her leftist Workersâ€ ™ Party denounced as an institutional â€œcoup dâ€ ™ etatâ€ � .
Corruption allegations have dogged his government ever since .
With Brazilâ€ ™ s economy mired in deep recession and stubbornly refusing to improve as Temer promised , some even questioned whether he will be able to survive until the end of his mandate in 2018 .
â€œImpeachment did not end the political crisis , â€ � said Mauricio Santoro , a political scientist and professor of international relations at the State University of Rio de Janeiro .
â€œThe current president probably wonâ€ ™ t finish his mandate.â€ �
Others said lawmakers may try to protect Temer because his removal would worsen Brazilâ€ ™ s deepening political chaos .
â€œA lot of the parties might come to the conclusion that itâ€ ™ s bad enough already , letâ€ ™ s not make it worse .
Letâ€ ™ s muddle through with him , â€ � said David Fleischer , emeritus professor of political science at the University of BrasÃ­lia .
The Guardian has seen a copy of the 82-page plea bargain from Claudio Melo Filho , former director of institutional relations at construction giant Odebrecht .
The company is deeply embroiled in a multi - billion dollar graft scandal at state - run oil company Petrobras in which dozens of politicians , executives and middle men have been jailed .
Its former CEO Marcelo Odebrecht has been in prison since June 2015 in connection with the investigation .
The scandal was a major driver in Rousseffâ€ ™ s impeachment , although she was ousted for breaking budget laws and has not been personally implicated .
Filho is reported to be just one of 77 Odebrecht executives to have signed collaboration deals .
Widely leaked to Brazilian media over the weekend , Filhoâ€ ™ s allegations have had an explosive impact in Brazil .
â€œWe are in front of a tsunami of unprecedented proportions , with the potential to sweep out the principal parties and pre - candidates for the presidency in 2018 ( when new elections are due),â€ � columnist Bernardo Mellho Franco wrote in the Folha de S Paulo newspaper on Sunday .
In the plea bargain , Filho alleged in colourful detail how leading lawmakers from Temerâ€ ™ s and other parties across the political spectrum were paid millions in bribes and both legal and illegal campaign donations to defend the companyâ€ ™ s interest in Congress .
Temer is mentioned 43 times .
Temer and the other politicians named have denied Filhoâ€ ™ s allegations .
In a statement , Temer said Odebrecht made voluntary donations without receiving anything in return .
â€œThe president repudiates the false information , â€ � the statement said .
Filho claimed he had attended a dinner with Marcelo Odebrecht at the vice - presidential palace months before the 2014 elections during which he said Temer solicited financial support for his partyâ€ ™ s campaigns .
A figure of Â£2.3 m was agreed , Filho claimed , some of which he said was later paid in cash to a SÃ£o Paulo lawyer , friend and special aide of Temerâ€ ™ s called JosÃ © Yunes , he said .
Yunes has denied the claim .
Filha also said that over a number of years , Â£5 m ( $ 6.35 m ) was paid Senator Romero JucÃ ¡ , who quit as Temerâ€ ™ s planning minister in May after wiretaps revealed him plotting to obstruct the Petrobras investigation .
Filha said that senate president Renan Calheiros is also received Â£118,000 ( $ 149,766 ) in two 2010 payments alone .
Calheiros was a target for anti - corruption protestors on 4 December after Brazilâ€ ™ s supreme court accepted charges of embezzlement against him in a separate case .
When a supreme court judge ordered Calheiros be suspended from his Senate role the following day , Calheiros simply ignored the order .
Two days later the court controversially overturned the decision but ruled Calheiros could no longer stand in for the president .
He is also being investigated in the Petrobras probe .
On Monday Brazilâ€ ™ s prosecutor - general , Rodrigo Janot , presented new charges of money laundering and passive corruption against Calheiros and lawmaker AnÃ­bal Gomes for allegedly receiving Â£188,000 in bribes from a supplier company involved in the Petrobras scandal .
Because Brazil has no vice president , Calheiros is third in line after Rodrigo Maia , speaker of the lower house .
But Maia is also cited in the plea bargain
â€ “
Melo Filho said he paid Maia nearly Â£24,000 ( $ 30,460 ) in 2013 .
This means that the three men in line of succession to rule Brazil have all been cited , heightening the sense of political insecurity .
But the accusation could be included in an ongoing investigation at Brazilâ€ ™ s highest electoral court into whether bribe money helped fund Rousseff and Temerâ€ ™
s winning 2014 re - election campaign .
Speaking on the condition of anonymity , a judge on Brazilâ€ ™ s supreme electoral tribunal said the accusations could and may well be included in a decision that could see both mandates revoked .
A ruling is likely in the first half of next year .
So many politicians from all parties have been accused of graft that it is unclear who might take over if Temer does fall .
If he were to fall after the end of this year , an indirect election is held in Congress .
â€œWhen we have a wave like this hitting all politicians and moderates , it opens space for the extremists , â€ � said Santoro .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a very serious moment.â€ �"
2016-12-13,"Brazilâ€ ™ s senate has passed a controversial spending cap that will limit public spending to inflation for the next 20 years , despite protests across the country against the measure .
The spending cap , known as PEC 55 , will now be signed off on 15 December .
Its approval was seen as vital for the beleaguered government of centrist President Michel Temer who took over from the leftist Dilma Rousseff , after a divisive , eight - month impeachment process was concluded in August .
Temer has staked his governmentâ€ ™ s credibility on measures to reduce public spending â€ “ which soared out of control under Rousseff as Brazil sunk into a debilitating recession â€ “ and his ability to control the bickering parties in an unruly congress .
â€œToday was a show of force that Temer still has a majority in congress to approve these reforms , â€ � said JoÃ£o Castro Neves , Latin America director at Washington DC - based consulting outfit Eurasia .
â€œFrom a more market perspective itâ€ ™ s also a victory because itâ€ ™ s a first step towards a more sound fiscal framework.â€ �
But the spending cap has been described by a senior UN official as the most socially regressive austerity package in the world , while Brazilian leftists argued that it will damage the countryâ€ ™ s already fragile health and education systems .
In a poll published on Tuesday by the Datafolha polling institute , 60 % of Brazilians said they opposed it .
â€œThe poor have woken up , â€ �
Leonardo Sakamoto , a popular commentator , wrote on his blog on Tuesday .
â€œThey have realized that they will have to pay someone elseâ€ ™ s bill for the economic crisis with the gradual reduction in quality of public services , which they are dependent on.â€ � Marcelo Freixo , a deputy in the Rio de Janeiro state assembly for the Socialism and Freedom party , said the rich should pay more of the bill for Brazilâ€ ™ s economic crisis .
â€œWe defend the taxing of great fortunes ; taxing of inheritance ; debt collection of big tax dodgers and the end of tax breaks for bankers , â€ � Freixo tweeted .
Despite huge gaps between rich and poor , Brazilâ€ ™ s highest rate of income tax is just 27.5 % .
There were protests in at least nine states and the Federal District of BrasÃ­lia , where local media reported that police used tear gas on around 2,000 demonstrators who torched barricades and threw rocks .
More protests can be expected , said Vitor GuimarÃ£es , a national coordinator for the Homeless Workers Movement , a leftist group that opposed the impeachment process by blocking roads and occupying public buildings .
â€œSocial movements will keep up the struggle , â€ �
he said .
Temer is already under fire over allegations that he sought illegal campaign donations from a huge construction company deeply involved in a multibillion - dollar corruption scandal at the state - run oil company Petrobras .
The senate president , Renan Calheiros , a member of the same centrist party , is clinging on to his job after being charged on 12 December by Brazilâ€ ™ s prosecutor - general for corruption and money laundering .
He was suspended by a supreme court judge on 5 December after being indicted in a separate corruption case , but the decision was reversed by the court two days later .
â€œYour excellence is only in this chair because of PEC 55,â€ � Lindbergh Farias , a senator for Rousseffâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ party , told him during Tuesdayâ€ ™ s session , in comments reported by the Congress in Focus site , a watchdog .
Temerâ€ ™ s government said minimum health and education spending would be preserved .
The budget increase for 2017 will be 7.2 % .
The government also said Temer had telephoned the US president - elect , Donald Trump , on Tuesday , who congratulated him â€œfor the reforms and measures to promote the growth of Brazilâ€ � .
Temer indicated he was determined to press on with the next of his austerity measures â€ “ a detailed reform of Brazilâ€ ™ s generous pensions system , in which some professions can retire as young as their late 40s .
â€œAre there conflicts and problems in the country ?
There are .
But we canâ€ ™ t let this paralyze Brazil , â€ �
Temer tweeted on Tuesday .
Castro Neves said that the spending cap was harsh but argued it would force a much - needed debate on Brazilâ€ ™ s bloated public spending , much of which is fixed in law .
And adjustments can be made down the line , he said .
â€œBrazilâ€ ™ s budget is too rigid .
You have a lot of mandatory spending , â€ �
Castro Neves said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to create that debate because trade - offs are becoming to become more evident .
Thereâ€ ™ s no free lunch.â€ �"
2016-12-24,"Reversals of fortune do not come much sharper or more symbolic than that suffered by Dilma Rousseff over the past year .
Last December , she was still in the early stages of her second term as Brazilâ€ ™ s first woman president .
Unbeaten in elections , she lived in a palace , commanded Latin Americaâ€ ™ s biggest bureaucracy , joined summit banquets alongside Barack Obama , Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel , and went on her morning bicycle ride in BrasÃ­lia with the full protection given to a head of state .
Today , however , after being levered from power by her running mate and impeached by Congress , Rousseff lives in her motherâ€ ™ s apartment , buys her own groceries at the local supermarket , has a one - man security detail and rides her bike along the seafront of Rio de Janeiro with the rest of the crowd .
There can be few more striking personifications of the demise of the political left in the past 12 months .
But even though it may seem that the world has moved backwards in terms of gender , race and income equality , Rousseff â€ “ who has arguably lost more than anyone â€ “ says that for her , this is by no means rock bottom .
â€œEvery day has been difficult ,
â€ �
she tells the Guardian during an interview near her residence in Rio de Janeiro .
â€œBut this is not the worst year I have experienced .
Not at all.â€ � That distinction belongs to the period 1970 - 1972 , when she was imprisoned and tortured for belonging to a clandestine Marxist guerrilla organisation that was committed to overthrowing the military dictatorship .
She suffered beatings , electric shocks and other forms of abuse without ever giving up the names of her collaborators .
In comparison , she said , even the bleakest moments of the past year have been bearable .
Among the worst was on 17 April , when her fate was effectively sealed by a rowdy lower house impeachment vote .
Her alleged wrongdoing â€ “ window dressing government accounts â€
“ was far less severe than the accusations faced by more than 100 of the deputies who rose in judgment against her , but she was damned nonetheless , putting her on a course that later led to her removal from the presidency and the negation of the 54 m votes that put her in power .
How did she feel that night ?
â€œItâ€ ™ s hard to say .
There is such a kaleidoscope of memories , â€ � she says ,
pausing at some length to find the right words , â€œI felt sadness , despair and indignation.â€ � Expressions of emotion do not come easily to Rousseff in sharp contrast to her Workersâ€ ™ party mentor and predecessor as president , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva .
The two of them watched the impeachment vote together on a TV in the presidential palace .
While he sobbed , she ordered popcorn .
â€œHe cried , and he hugged me , and he said to me â€˜cry Dilma , cry!â€ ™
But I donâ€ ™ t cry when Iâ€ ™ m moved .
Thatâ€ ™ s not how I am , â€ � Rousseff said .
Asked if she had always been like that or whether it was a mental hardening that occurred during her torture , the former prisoner pauses again .
â€œI think it goes back to that time .
You can break at any moment
so you have to keep fooling yourself .
You have to keep kidding yourself that itâ€ ™ s nearly over or else you fold .
You tell yourself , itâ€ ™ s just 10 more minutes .
Then , 10 minutes later , you persuade yourself itâ€ ™ s just another 10.â€ �
Those old scars were reopened during the impeachment debate by ultra - right deputy Jair Bolsonaro , who dedicated his pro - impeachment vote to the military dictatorship â€ “ specifically to the army colonel who tortured Rousseff .
â€œI was shocked he could say that in congress , â€ � she recalls .
Bolsonaro , who plans to stand for the presidency himself in 2018 , was never punished for his comments â€ “ a sign of both the impunity and the conservatism that characterise Brazilâ€
™ s congress .
Rousseff believes misogyny is partly to blame for her downfall , as well as the election defeat in the United States of Hillary Clinton â€ “ who the Brazilian describes as a â€œfriend despite our differencesâ€ � .
As she has noted on numerous occasions , there are double standards for women politicians , who tend to be called â€œhardâ€ � rather than â€œstrongâ€ � when they take tough decisions .
â€œThe fact that I was the first woman president was a factor in what happened to me .
It is hard to quantify .
It wasnâ€ ™ t 100 % because of that .
But it was a component ,
â€ � she says .
â€œI think it will be easier for the next woman president.â€ �
Her critics say she brought about her own downfall .
Enemies on the right say she ruined the economy ( now in its deepest recession for decades ) .
The disaffected on the left believe her budget cuts were a betrayal of her election promises .
Many across the political spectrum suspect that she knew about â€ “ and politically benefited from â€ “ a massive bribery and kickback scheme at the state - run oil giant Petrobras , even if she wasnâ€ ™ t directly involved or personally enriched .
Even allies who praise her for being unusually honest and well - intentioned admit she tends to be secretive and a dire communicator .
Freed from the responsibility of office , Rousseff is now more loquacious .
She appears to be on a mission to clear her name .
The senate acknowledged her relatively modest individual guilt by not stripping her of her political rights after ejecting her from office on 30 August .
But she wants her side of the story told and â€ “ like Lula â€ “ has probably granted more interviews in the past few months than in the previous five years .
She blames Brazilâ€ ™ s dire economy on a global storm of falling commodity prices , weakening Chinese demand , a debilitating drought and the after - effects of the 2008 financial crisis .
Behind the political turmoil , she sees a cabal of plotters â€ “ led by current president Michel Temer , her former deputy who she says engineered her downfall , and former lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha â€ “ who have dragged the traditionally centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement party to the right .
Allied to oligarchical interests in the financial sector , she said they turned against her with greater strength after she cut real interest rates for the first time in more than a decade and achieved almost full employment .
Complicating the whole situation , she says , is the increasing fragmentation of political parties , which has created a climate for corruption .
In the 1990s , thenpresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso needed the support of only three parties to secure a simple majority in congress .
In the following decade , Lula had needed eight .
By the time Rousseff left office , this had increased to 12 .
â€œItâ€ ™ s every day .
Everything is a negotiation .
Itâ€ ™ s the only way to get power , â€ � she said .
â€œPeople say I donâ€ ™ t like politics , but that is not true .
What I donâ€
™ t like is the buying and selling â€ ¦
Itâ€ ™ s always existed , but not to this degree.â€
�
This is somewhat disingenuous .
Rousseff was at the apex of this system for close to a decade , first as chief of staff for Lula and then as president .
Unlike many of her accusers , she may not have gained personally (
as she says , â€œI donâ€ ™ t have secret Swiss bank accounts , I didnâ€
™ t rob anythingâ€ � )
but she was unwilling or unable to push a meaningful clear - up on her party and coalition allies .
Instead , she left prosecutors and the courts to do the job , while focusing her government on its social and political goals .
Asked if she regretted winning in 2014 â€ “ just as this system started to come crashing down along with the economy â€ “
Rousseff shakes her head .
â€œNot for one moment .
If I hadnâ€ ™ t won , things would be much worse now .
We would already have an austerity and privatisation package like that of [ President Mauricio ]
Macri in Argentina.â€
�
Although she credits her short - lived second administration for delaying and reducing the impact of the neoliberal tide now sweeping Latin America , she is not optimistic about the near - term prospects for progressive politicians in Brazil or elsewhere .
Brexit and the election of Donald Trump are , she says , a cause for wider concerns .
â€œWith the increase once again of inequality , especially in developed countries , it creates the conditions for disbelief in democracy .
If the demands of the population can not be met by governments , then politics becomes irrelevant .
Then , it wonâ€ ™ t be projects or proposals , or even utopias , that will move people .
Instead , people will focus on symbols , slogans and scapegoats .
Thatâ€ ™ s when the right rises and intolerance grows.â€
�
For most of her life , Rousseff has been fighting these trends .
But for now , she plans to step back and study her enemy .
Her immediate plan is to research the concept of â€œstates of exceptionâ€
�
â€ “ the term coined by Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt to justify dictators who bypass national laws in the name of the public good .
With these justifications creeping back â€ “ for example with the Patriot Act in the US , the criminalisation of the poor and the treatment of refugees â€ “
Rousseff says the memoirs will have to wait ."
2016-12-27,"The challenges that confronted Dilma Rousseff in cleaning up Brazilian political life can not be underestimated ( From presidential palace to her motherâ€ ™ s flat , 24 December ) .
In 2012 , I was contracted by Unesco to advise the government on implementing the access to information decree the president had signed .
Among the first disclosure demands made by the press were for details of salaries and perks received by ministers , judges and public officials .
This prompted legal action by trade unions ( which had negotiated lucrative deals for their members ) to try to prevent disclosure , and fierce resistance within the coalition government .
When the matter was taken to Rousseff she instructed that full disclosure should be made , starting with her own pay package .
Subsequently , the published details revealed that a third of ministers and almost 4,000 federal employees breached the pay ceiling set by the constitution , and were earning more than the president .
Bloated rewards included up to an additional six monthsâ€ ™ salary per year , accounted for as cost - of - living allowances or in lieu of educational leave .
Even some congressional parking and lift attendants were earning up to 10 times more than the average salary of a teacher or police officer .
Those embarrassed were unlikely to forgive her for breaching the code of silence on these arrangements , far less support her in tackling other areas of political back - scratching .

2017-01-13,"After the undemocratic removal of Dilma Rousseff as president of Brazil ( Report , 24 December ) via an illegitimate process that saw 62 senators overturn the votes of 54 million , there has been an unprecedented defamation campaign against former president Lula .
This â€œtrial by mediaâ€ � is an attempt to keep Lula from participating in the political process .
As a highly popular figure as a result of reforms that lifted millions from poverty , Lula is considered a possible candidate in the 2018 elections .
Investigating Lula , prosecutors have been unable to find any illegal activity committed .
Despite this , they have submitted him to a number of arbitrary constraints and detainments , leading to a UN investigation taking place due to concern that his rights have been infringed .

2017-02-24,"Brazilâ€ ™ s notoriously bacchanalian carnival is more political than usual this year with organisers and revellers tackling sexism , homophobia , Donald Trump and the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff .
The mood was evident at Occupy Carnival and anti - government parades in SÃ£o Paulo , Belo Horizonte and Rio ahead of the worldâ€ ™ s biggest street party , which officially starts on Friday .
Some revellers in sombreros carried mock - ups of Trumpâ€ ™ s proposed Mexican border wall scrawled with his racist and sexist comments .
Others wore costumes highlighting the alarming wealth gap in Brazil .
Roseanna Martins was with a group of female friends dressed as the rich , pampered wives of corrupt politicians â€ “ complete with plastic champagne flutes and even a security guard â€ “ at a street party , or bloco , in Rioâ€ ™ s middle - class Laranjeiras neighbourhood last Saturday .
â€œMany people are showing discontent ,
â€ � the teacher said .
One party on Friday is called Temer Out , echoing the leftist rallying cry calling for Rousseffâ€ ™ s unpopular replacement , Michel Temer , to be ousted .
The slogan was also chanted by a huge crowd at the CordÃ£o de BoitatÃ ¡
bloco in central Rio last Sunday and â€œcoup - monger outâ€ � was written in gold on one of the paradeâ€ ™ s colourful standards .
â€œCarnival is a mirror of what we dream will happen one day with society , â€ � said TomÃ¡s Ramos , one of the organisers of Occupy Carnival , a group that helps a network of dozens of blocos articulate anti - government arguments .
Rioâ€ ™ s street parties have long touched on political themes .
After the 9/11 attacks , some people dressed as Osama bin Laden .
Last year , in the midst of Brazilâ€ ™ s vast Lava Jato â€ “ or car wash â€ “ corruption investigation , parades featured giant dolls of the prosecutors , police and judges involved in the case .
VÃ¡gner Fernandes , an author and the president of the Timoneiros da Viola bloco , said the political element may seem more prominent this year because the country was going through the worst crisis he could remember .
â€œCarnival is there to exorcise all the demons of day - to - day life , â€ �
he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an occasion for reflection through joy .
That may seem paradoxical , but in Brazil we express all the bitterness while laughing and jumping around.â€ �
Some carnival organisers said the political dimension reflected bigger issues being fiercely debated in Brazil .
â€œWe need to talk about prejudice , â€ � said Rodrigo Bento , an organiser of the SÃ£o Paulo bloco Pilantragi , whose theme at last Sundayâ€ ™ s parade was â€œlove
yes , homophobia noâ€
� .
â€œCarnival is an opportune moment to remind people who maybe never had any relationship with the cause , â€ � Bento said .
A campaign under the hashtag # CarnavalSemAssedio â€ “ meaning harassment - free carnival â€ “ has taken off among Brazilian women fed up with the aggressive approaches men traditionally adopt in the charged atmosphere of carnival .
The campaignâ€ ™ s samba anthem
â€ “ a duet by Bruna Caram and Chico CÃ
© sar called Se VocÃª Quiser ( If You Would Like )
that gently explains the difference between flirting and harassment â€ “ has been watched more than 500,000 times .
â€œPeople grab women by the arm , pull them by the hair , at times force a kiss , â€ � said LetÃ­cia Bahia , the institutional director of the feminist magazine Azmina , one of the campaignâ€ ™ s organisers .
â€œYou realise that the guy doing it does not see it as an aggression .
For him it is normal , an expression of carnival.â€ �
The campaign began at last yearâ€ ™ s carnival , when calls to a helpline for women to denounce violence increased 221 % .
This year it has exploded .
In Belo Horizonte , a group called As Minas do Carnaval de BelÃ ´ ( Belo Carnival Girls ) has produced its own video manifesto , complete with costumed dancers and music .
â€œI am a carnival lover , â€ � it explains .
â€œBut
donâ€ ™ t touch me without my permission.â€ �
Some blocos have changed the words to traditional songs seen as sexist or homophobic .
Bianca Behrends , a historian , said carnival had a long tradition of good - humoured social criticism .
Recently , this has been largely absent from the main samba school parades at the SambÃ³dromo due to the eventâ€ ™ s commercialisation .
But this year two of the big schools address politically sensitive themes : Imperatriz will highlight the plight of indigenous tribes in the Amazon and Beija - flor will focus on miscegenation .
But it is the street parties that more forcefully echo popular sentiment .
â€œIn Brazil as a whole , people are disillusioned , â€ � Behrends said .
â€œYou change gender , parties , the situation â€
“
but everything is still so bad , nothing works .
People are saturated , and now they are on the streets , criticising this in their own way.â€ �"
2017-06-06,"The scandal - plagued presidency of Michel Temer will come under scrutiny by Brazilâ€ ™ s top electoral court in the first of several encounters with the judiciary that could result in his removal from office .
Less than a year after he plotted the ousting of his former running mate , Dilma Rousseff , the centre - right leader faces charges that he abused his power by using illegal campaign donations to win the vice - presidency in the 2014 election .
The opening of hearings by the supreme electoral tribunal on Tuesday comes amid the intensifying Car Wash graft purge that has forced several ministerial resignations , resulted in numerous jailings and seen the prosecutor general formally accuse the president of corruption and obstruction of justice .
On the morning of the electoral tribunal trial , police arrested the former tourism minister Henrique Eduardo Alves , who is charged with bribery relating to the construction of a 2014 World Cup stadium in Natal .
At the weekend , a close Temer aide , Rodrigo Rocha Loures , was also taken into custody after being stripped of his congressional seat and caught with a suitcase containing 500,000 reais of alleged bribe money .
The prosecutor general , Rodrigo Janot , has launched an investigation of Temer , following the release of secretly recorded conversations that suggested the president discussed hush money payments to the jailed former house speaker Eduardo Cunha .
Amid rumours of more damning audio tapes , plea bargains and a possible supreme court trial of the president , some commentators have urged the electoral tribunal to nullify the 2014 elections , which could â€ “ after an appeal process â€ “ strip Temer of his post and force a new run .
However , this is thought unlikely , because the tribunal is presided over by the supreme court justice Gilmar Mendes , who is close to Temer â€ “ and is himself accused to conspiring to pervert the course of the Car Wash investigation .
Most analysts believe Temer can count on the support of a majority of the seven - judge tribunal .
A verdict could come as early as Thursday or be postponed for several weeks .
Even if found guilty by the tribunal , Temer could remain in office while he appeals .
Any verdict against him in the supreme court would also need to be endorsed by a two - thirds majority of Congress , where the ruling coalition currently have a comfortable majority .
This could change if a key ally â€ “ the conservative Brazilian Social Democratic party ( PSDB ) â€ “ abandons the government .
But many in the business and financial sector want Temer to stay in power so he can push through unpopular pension reforms .
However , many voters want Temer to quit .
His approval ratings have slipped into single digits , there have been violent clashes between protesters and police on the streets , and polls suggest the vast majority of the public would like fresh elections .
AntÃ´nio Augusto de Queiroz , political analyst at Intersyndical Parliamentary Assistance Department , said the tribunal was likely to postpone a decision , though Temer would remain under pressure .
â€œThe vulnerability of the government is at very high levels .
He could be condemned by the electoral court , he could lose PSDB ( a coalition party ) support for his government , and there is still the Rocha Louro plea bargain.â€ �
Among the possible scenarios he painted was Temer standing down and blaming his resignation on alleged campaign violations by his former running mate Rousseff .
Even if the tribunal judges in favour of Temer , the president will still struggle to complete his mandate until the end of 2018 , according to Sylvio Costa of the parliamentary watchdog group Congresso em Foco .
â€œTemer
doesnâ€ ™ t govern anymore .
All his time is dedicated to defending himself , â€ � said Costa .
â€œEverything is leaning against him remaining in his position .
We will continue in crisis for a while longer.â€ �

2017-07-12,"Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , once the most popular president in Brazilâ€ ™ s recent history , has been sentenced to nine years and six months in prison after being found guilty on corruption and money - laundering charges .
Although Lula , as he is universally known , will remain free pending an appeal â€ “ and his supporters denounced the sentence as political persecution â€ “ the ruling marks an extraordinary fall for a leader Barack Obama once called â€œthe most popular politician on earthâ€ � .
Lula won two mandates as Brazilâ€ ™ s first president from the leftist Workersâ€ ™ party and helped his hand - picked successor , Dilma Rousseff , win two subsequent elections before she was impeached last year for breaking budget rules amid a sprawling corruption scandal at state - run oil company Petrobras .
Passing sentence on the former president , Judge Sergio Moro said Lula took part in the corruption scheme , in which billions of dollars were paid to middlemen , executives and politicians for fat contracts .
Lula still faces four more trials , in a process defence lawyers say constitutes a judicial blitzkrieg designed to prevent him returning to politics .
â€œSymbolically [ the sentence ] has a very heavy weight , not just for him but for the country , that voted not just twice for him but twice for the candidate he indicated , â€ � said Carlos Melo , a professor of political science at Insper , a business school in SÃ£o Paulo .
Born into barefoot poverty in Brazilâ€ ™ s arid north - east , Lula ran the powerful metal workersâ€ ™ union before helping found the Workersâ€ ™ party with fellow leftists , unionists and intellectuals in 1980 .
He fought and lost three elections before winning the first of two mandates in 2002 .
Thanks to transformative social policies and a booming economy , tens of millions of Brazilians escaped poverty during his rule .
No other Brazilian politician in recent decades has been able to capture popular imagination with such verve .
Although his reputation has been tarnished in recent years , he currently leads polling for the 2018 election .
If his conviction is upheld by a higher court , however , he will be ineligible to stand .
â€œHe will dramatize this process , of course , he will say this is a process to stop him being a candidate .
The condemnation will enter the political game , â€ � Melo said .
â€œThe Workersâ€ ™ party will exploit this politically and say Lula is a victim.â€ � Wednesdayâ€ ™ s sentence was related to accusations that Lula benefited from about Â£590,000 in bribes from a construction company called OAS , which the prosecution alleged was paid in the shape of a seaside duplex apartment , renovated at Lulaâ€ ™ s request .
In his ruling , Moro said that Lula had bought a simpler apartment in the same building worth about Â£53,000 , and the company had upgraded him .
Prosecutors said the payment was part of around Â£21 m that OAS paid in bribes to Lulaâ€ ™ s Workersâ€ ™ party in return for lucrative contracts as part of two oil refineries that Petrobras was building , Moro wrote in his sentence .
â€œThe responsibility of a president of the republic is enormous , and , consequently , so is his guilt when he practises crimes , â€ � Moro wrote .
During his trial in May , Lula gave five hours of testimony in which he angrily proclaimed his innocence and denied ever owning the apartment .
His lawyers , Cristiano Martins and Valeska Martins , attacked the sentence in a statement .
â€œPresident Lula is innocent .
For over three years , Lula has been subject to a politically motivated investigation .
No credible evidence of guilt has been produced , and overwhelming proof of his innocence blatantly ignored , â€ � they said .
â€œWe will prove Lulaâ€ ™ s innocence in all unbiased courts including the United Nations.â€ �
Other leftist groups also condemned the ruling .
â€œThe conviction came without any truth , â€ � the Homeless Workersâ€ ™ Movement said in a statement .
â€œIt is evident that the sentence is a form of judicial shortcut to remove Lula from the political dispute.â€ �
But the sentence divided Brazilians .
Angel Inoue , 36 , a TV scriptwriter from SÃ£o Paulo , said she was pleased .
â€œI know the ( Workersâ€ ™ party ) started as a cool idea , but at a certain point , this idea was substituted for power and greed , â€ �
she said .
Mariluce de Souza , 35 , an artist and community leader from the Complexo do AlemÃ£o favela in Rio de Janeiro , said Lulaâ€ ™ s case was more closely linked to his party than him personally .
â€œAll politicians are guilty of some sort of corruption , â€ � she said .
Lulaâ€ ™ s government was first hit by a corruption scandal called the MensalÃ£o , in which lawmakers were allegedly paid to vote for government measures .
He was still re - elected in 2006 and left office with an 87 % approval rating .
When his successor Rousseff was impeached in August 2016 , she and Lula denounced the process as a â€œcoupâ€ � .
Rousseff was succeeded by her former running mate , Michel Temer , whose administration has also been dogged by graft scandals .
Temer himself is facing corruption charges that could see him tried by Brazilâ€
™ s supreme court if two - thirds of Brazilâ€ ™ s lower house agree in a vote expected in the coming days ."
2017-09-03,"In 2014 , Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer were elected together , respectively , as president and vice - president of Brazil .
As a result of the constitutional process that led to the impeachment of Rousseff , approved by the national congress with the scrutiny of the federal supreme court , Temer took over as president .
To say , therefore , that his government is illegitimate ( Letters , 31 August ) is not only untrue , but also reveals a misjudgment of the Brazilian political system .
Under the rule of law , our democratic and republican institutions have proved once again their resilience in the face of a very serious crisis .
It is also incorrect to argue that Temer is reversing social programmes .
On the contrary , his government is putting the country back on track after the tremendous fiscal , economic and social crises created in the previous years , which led to the worst recession and unemployment rate the country has ever endured .
Now economic growth is back on the rise , jobs are being recovered and new opportunities for trade and investment are being generated .
