2001-11-02,"Taliban troops claimed last night that they were closing in on a key opposition tribal leader who had entered the country on a secret pro - US mission .
A week after executing Abdul Haq , the senior Afghan opposition commander , the Taliban said they are now on the brink of capturing Hamid Karzai , a supporter of Afghanistan 's former king Zahir Shah .
They are pursuing him in the mountains of Oruzgan province , according to the news agency Afghan Islamic Press .
The Taliban 's ambassador to Pakistan , Abdul Salam Zaeef , last night claimed that four American helicopters had mounted a desperate but futile attempt to rescue Mr Karzai and others with him after Taliban soldiers attacked their hideout in Dehrawad district in the province . ""
The leader of the group is Hamid Karzai , "" the ambassador declared .
"" The group has gone into the mountains , and the Taliban are still following them . ""
Mr Karzai , the Quetta - based leader of the Popolzai tribe in southern Afghanistan , was rumoured to have entered the country two weeks ago .
His mission has not been revealed , but there seems little doubt that he was trying to encourage his followers to rise up against the Taliban and support a new government under the deposed king .
A tribal leader like Mr Karzai is essential to Washington 's increasingly frustrated bid to create a post - Taliban administration because he belongs to the dominant Pashtun ethnic majority , from which the Taliban are almost exclusively drawn .
The opposition Northern Alliance is made up of minority Tajiks and Uzbeks .
He slipped into Afghanistan before the Taliban captured Haq last Friday .
Taliban troops ambushed Haq , together with his nephew and several other followers near Jalalabad .
After an abortive attempt by the US to rescue him , he was convicted of treason and hanged .
Mr Karzai can expect similar treatment if captured .
The second execution of an anti - Taliban leader within a week would leave the White House 's floundering attempts to create a broad - based government in Afghanistan in disarray .
Haq and Mr Karzai are the only two significant Afghan tribal leaders to have publicly embraced the US 's anti - Taliban project .
In Quetta , Mr Karzai 's brother , Ahmed , last night confirmed that a gun battle with Taliban fighters had taken place , but he claimed that his brother was safe .
He refused to give more details .
The BBC reported last night that Mr Karzai had telephoned them to say he was safe and well .
He said he had been surrounded by Taliban forces , but had managed to fight them off .
He claimed to have recruited another Pashtun tribal leader , Mahalem Abdul Ghader , who also spoke to the BBC , saying he his men had fought Taliban troops earlier in the day .
A close aide of the exiled 87-year - old king , Zamai Rassoul , said last night in Rome that he had no information about an attack on Mr Karzai or a US helicopter attempt to rescue him .
But he added : "" We know that he is safe .
If he is stranded in Oruzgan province , his chances of escape appear slim .
The remote region is a Taliban stronghold , and is where the Taliban 's leader , Mullah Mohammad Omar , grew up .
Osama bin Laden is also known to have a small base in Oruzgan , where he has hidden in the past ."
2001-11-03,"The Taliban 's leader Mullah Mohammed Omar was last night facing the uncomfortable prospect of rebellion deep in his own heartland after his troops yesterday failed to capture an opposition commander who had slipped into Afghanistan on a clandestine pro - US mission .
The Pashtun tribal leader Hamid Karzai had managed to escape his Taliban pursuers who ambushed him two days ago in the remote central province of Oruzgan , his supporters said .
He was now organising a revolt against the Taliban and was being protected by disaffected villagers , they added .
Mr Karzai , a supporter and distant relative of Afghanistan 's deposed king , Zahir Shah , entered Taliban territory three weeks ago .
Before setting off on his mission he made little secret of his aims : to spark off an insurrection against the Taliban in the south , and rally support among his fellow tribesman for the exiled king .
On Thursday night the Taliban announced that they had ambushed Mr Karzai 's party in Deh Rawod , Oruzgan 's south - western tip and were pursuing him across the province 's dry jagged mountains and irrigated valleys .
If captured , Mr Karzai can expect the same bloody treatment as Abdul Haq , the opposition commander who was ambushed and then executed by the Taliban on a similar mission last week .
Yesterday one of Mr Karzai 's supporters insisted that he was alive and well .
He had been short of food but was now being provided for by local people .
"" Things are moving now .
Hamid told me the tribes were joining him and that he had a lot of support .
They are mobilising for a revolt within days , "" Zalmai Rassoul , an aide to the exiled king , said from Rome .
The Taliban had killed one of Mr Karzai 's men and wounded another in Thursday 's shoot - out , he added .
Speaking from Quetta , in Pakistan , Mr Karzai 's brother Ahmed also said the tribal leader had eluded Taliban troops .
He had spoken to him on his satellite phone early yesterday .
"" We managed to talk to him ... they are OK , "" he said .
"" There was some fighting , some heavy fighting yesterday .
One of the people in the group was slightly injured . ""
But the Taliban last night appeared confident they were closing in - and claimed to have arrested 25 of Mr Karzai 's supporters .
Several of the leaders would now be hanged , the Taliban information ministry official , Qari Fazil Rabi , said .
Acting on a tip - off , elite Taliban soldiers had walked for nine hours before attempting to storm Mr Karzai 's base . ""
Hamid Karzai and his companions fled to the mountains and two of their men were killed in the operation , "" he said .
"" We also seized 600 new guns , which were dropped in the area by American helicopters , which also pounded the area during our operation .
"" We are chasing them now .
We believe that American helicopters brought Karzai and his people to the area most probably , as it is difficult to get there , "" he added .
For the Pentagon , which has had little to celebrate over the past four weeks , the stakes could not be higher .
Mr Karzai , the leader of the Kandahar - based Popalzai tribe , belongs to the same ethnic group as the Taliban , the Pashtun .
If the Taliban capture and kill him the US 's attempts to create a broad - based post - Taliban administration will have ended in horrible failure .
But if Mr Karzai manages to stir up a Pashtun rebellion in the south , the Taliban could be in trouble for the first time , encircled by hostile tribesman from their own ethnic groups , and the US - assisted opposition in the north . ""
Oruzgan is where Mullah Omar and many key Taliban commanders came from .
A lot of people from there have been heavily involved in the Islamic Emirate project , "" one source said last night .
"" We always said that if the Taliban ever had a last stand they would have it there in south Oruzgan .
Instead they are having their first stand there . ""
The source added : "" Karzai is a brave man .
He is working in a difficult place .
And he is dicing with death . ""
With its isolated valleys and harsh terrain , Oruzgan is the kind of place where it is easy to disappear .
Osama bin Laden has a small base in Oruzgan , to which he has retreated in the past .
The Taliban could balk at sending Bin Laden 's Arab fighters to crush fellow Pashtuns , one observer said .
Winters in the area are comparatively mild .
Mr Karzai 's family yesterday said he was better armed than Abdul Haq .
The US , which failed to rescue Haq , might try harder this time to pluck Mr Karzai from danger .
A deputy foreign minister in Afghanistan 's 1992 - 94 mojahedin government , Mr Karzai , 46 , was an early supporter of the Taliban movement .
But his enthusiasm ebbed when he realised the Taliban were not merely interested in bringing peace , but also wanted to turn Afghanistan into a laboratory for their Islamist beliefs .
His antipathy deepened two years ago when suspected Taliban assassins had killed his father in Peshawar , Pakistan , possibly with the connivance of the country 's intelligence agency , the ISI .
Over the past few months , numerous groups of disaffected Afghans have sat on the mattresses and soft Persian carpets in Mr Karzai 's Quetta house , to discuss Afganistan 's future .
Mr Karzai , a formal emissary of 87-year - old Zahir Shah , wants to convene a loya jirga or great council , the traditional mechanism by which Afghanistan 's fissiparous ethnic groups would iron out their differences .
While a loya jirga might be acceptable to many Afghan tribal leaders it remains a quixotic goal with the Taliban still in power .
With Taliban troops in pursuit , Mr Karzai 's fate is in the balance .
Escape into Pakistan across the southern Afghan deserts will be tricky .
The reward for success could be a top ministerial role in Afghanistan 's next government , whenever it comes .
But the penalty for failure is summary trial and a bullet in the head ."
2001-12-03,"The Northern Alliance today put forward the names of four prominent Afghans to serve at the head of an interim administration in the country .
The former deputy foreign minister , Hamid Karzai , former transitional president , Sibgatullah Mojadiddi , and two supporters of the former king , Zahir Shah - Abdul Sattar Sirat and Sayed Ahmed Gailini - have received the backing of the alliance .
But its nominal leader , Burhanuddin Rabbani , who served as president from 1992 until he was ousted from Kabul by the Taliban in 1996 , has been sidelined by meeting of the four factions in Bonn , Germany .
The Northern Alliance 's foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , said last week that his side was seeking no role for professor Rabbani , signaling a rift between its younger and old members .
With a UN blueprint for Afghanistan 's political future agreed , the composition of an interim administration to rule the country was the only issue slowing progress to a workable conclusion to the talks .
Mr Karzai , one of the names suggested for the top post , has the advantage of representing the Pashtuns , Afghanistan 's biggest ethnic group .
A moderate Muslim , he came under attack by Taliban forces a few weeks ago when he tried to rally Afghans to support a new government .
He is currently commanding forces trying to take Kandahar , the last Taliban stronghold .
A phone call from Mr Karzai to delegates on the conference 's opening day appealed for unity and called the meeting "" the path toward salvation "" .
Mr Sirat , also tipped to lead the interim administration , has strong support in the ex - king 's delegation , which he heads .
An ethnic Uzbek and Islamic scholar who lives in the United States , he was justice minister during the king 's reign .
The UN plan envisions a 29-member interim executive council to govern Afghanistan and an independent council of elders to convene a tribal gathering , or loya jirga , to write a democratic constitution leading to elections in an estimated two years .
Left open in the plan is the role of the ex - king , who has lived in exile in Rome since 1973 .
Diplomats say the monarch remains popular in Afghanistan and could convene the first loya jirga .
The draft deal also provides for deployment of an international security force to maintain law and order in Kabul and to help with the "" voluntary disarmament "" of Afghan fighters .
Western nations hope to use the promise of billions in reconstruction aid to prod the Afghans toward a historic agreement on a broad - based government , a constitution with full civil rights for women and eventual elections ."
2001-12-03,"Hamid Karzai , named as leader of Afghanistan 's transitional government The new head of Afghanistan 's interim administration is a 44-year - old tribesman who is as comfortable in a suit and tie as a turban and tunic .
Hamid Karzai is a commander from the Taliban heartland of Kandahar , where he has been leading troops in his homeland against the Islamic militia .
He was aligned to the Rome group at the Bonn talks , which represented the former king Zahir Shah .
In a far from auspicious turn of events on the day his new position was announced , he was reported to have been ' slightly injured ' by an errant US bomb which had been meant for Taliban troops .
Mr Karzai initially supported the creation of the Taliban in 1994 as an alternative to the lawlessness of the warlords who ruled Kandahar but soon grew disillusioned by the religious movement because he said it had been hijacked by neighbouring Pakistan .
Mr Karzai had his headquarters in Pakistan 's south - west Baluchistan province , but there was regular tension and mutual mistrust .
After the airstrikes started , Mr Karzai and another prominent Pashtun , Abdul Haq , slipped separately and secretly into Afghanistan to organise Pashtun resistance against the Taliban .
Haq was captured and hanged .
Mr Karzai was nearly caught but was rescued by US helicopters and special forces .
As the Taliban fled the capital Kabul on November 13 , driven southward by Northern Alliance soldiers , Mr Karzai was cutting deals with Pashtuns in Uruzgan to abandon the Taliban .
He then began moving southward toward Kandahar with an armed force of several thousand tribesmen .
Mr Karzai was born December 24 1957 , into one of southern Afghanistan 's most powerful tribes , the Popolzai .
Mr Karzai 's father was chief of the Popolzai tribe .
He was assassinated in the Pakistani city of Quetta in 1999 , a killing believed linked to Afghanistan 's violent feuds .
During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s , Mr Karzai was in Pakistan .
But when Islamic insurgents took power from the pro - Moscow regime in 1992 , Mr Karzai became Afghanistan 's deputy foreign minister .
The rebel government , led by Burhanuddin Rabbani , the current de facto ruler of Afghanistan , fought bitterly among themselves , destroying large sections of the city and killing 50,000 civilians .
Mr Karzai left Mr Rabbani 's government in the first years , disillusioned by the bickering between the groups .
Former Afghan king Zahir Shah Zahir Shah , who now resides in a villa outside Rome , was thrust on to the Afghan throne as a teenager in 1933 after his father was assassinated .
Forty years later he was forced into exile , as a coup was plotted around him .
Now , in his 88th year , after almost three decades of comfortable and anonymous exile , he has said during Afghanistan 's recent turmoil that he will return "" very shortly , to serve my country "" .
He had been seen as one of the few unifying figures who could act as the figurehead of a multi - tribal , multiparty transitional government , but his moment will come in the summer of next year when the king is expected to convene the traditional tribal council or loya jirga .
The plan agreed at Bonn is for a new government to be formed at this time .
The Northern Alliance General Abdul Rashid Dostum General Abdul Rashid Dostum is a 6 ft ethnic Uzbek warlord who controlled the strategic northern town of Mazar - i - Sharif until being dislodged by the Taliban in 1998 .
Not long ago , Gen Dostum 's troops reportedly went barefoot , were short of food , even water , and had not been paid for three years .
Now he has 20 American military "" advisers "" with him , and they have secured him ammunition drops from US planes .
The drops include Kalashnikov rifles , machineguns and large quantities of ammunition .
Gen Dostum has been described as a serial turncoat , having served in the old Afghan army under the former communist regime .
His defection to the mojahedin was one of the main factors in the downfall of the last communist government in 1992 .
Gen Dostum 's ferocious Uzbek troops briefly occupied parts of Kabul , before retiring to the warlord 's heartland of Mazar .
There he established a personal fiefdom .
For much of the 1990s , the city was at peace , and while Gen Dostum has a reputation for treachery and ruthlessness on the battlefield , he offered the people of the city freedom from random violence and the opportunity to live a more liberal , secular way of life .
Mohammed Ustad Atta
The Tajik commander Mohamed Ustad Atta leads another group of opposition forces .
He and Gen Dostum are bitter rivals dating back to the Soviet occupation , when they fought on different sides .
Gen Dostum was one of the senior commanders most trusted by the Soviets , and Atta was a Mazarite who had taken up arms against them as a mojahed .
The US seems to favour Gen Dostum , judging by the fact its small team of military advisers is based with him .
According to some reports , it was this rivalry which led to the initial failure of the alliance offensive against Mazar in September , with Atta charging ahead almost to the centre of the city and his supposed allies failing to keep up with him , forcing him to withdraw .
Mohamed Mohaqeq Mohamed Mohaqeq leads a third group of opposition forces , made up of Hazaras , a Persian - speaking ethnic group of mostly Shia Muslims , who inhabit the Hindu Kush mountain range with the Tajiks .
There is a long history of bloody violence between the Hazaras and the Pashtun tribes of southern Afghanistan .
General Mohammad Qasim Fahim
He took over as the military chief of the Northern Alliance two days before the World Trade Centre attacks , after the death of his widely - respected leader Ahmad Shah Massoud .
Gen Fahim , aged 41 , was Commander Massoud 's military deputy , head of the northern sector and chief of intelligence .
Born in the Panjshir valley he went to school in Kabul and after the communist coup in 1978 became a refugee in Pakistan for a year .
He returned as a mojahedin fighter and during the 1980s war commanded troops in the central province of Parwan and Baghlan , working closely with Cdr Massoud .
Now he leads 10,000 troops , the largest force in the Northern Alliance .
Although he has earned respect among alliance commanders as a soldier he lacks Cdr Massoud 's charm and following .
Burhanuddin Rabbani
He was a leading Islamic cleric at Kabul University and was forced to flee a 1970s crackdown on Islamic radicals .
The 61-year - old ethnic Tajik led the Jamiat - e Islami party which is now at the centre of the Northern Alliance and was Afghanistan 's president for four years until 1996 .
During his time in power much of Kabul was destroyed as rival mojahedin factions fought between themselves .
His refusal to relinquish power in line with a previous agreement to rotate the presidency , was a key factor in the enfeeblement of the mojahedin government and the subsequent success of the Taliban .
Although he remains the nominal president and head of the alliance , there have been constant reports of rifts between the cleric and the military commanders .
General Ismail Khan
He was an officer in the Afghan army when the Communists took power .
He defected after the Soviet invasion and led a bloody revolt against the Red Army in the western city of Herat .
Much of the city was destroyed in Soviet reprisals for his massacre of some 300 Russian "" advisers "" and their families .
For years he commanded military forces across western Afghanistan until he was driven out of Herat by the Taliban in 1995 .
He fled to Iran and later returned to fight against the Taliban but was betrayed by a fellow commander and jailed .
Last year Gen Khan , aged 55 , escaped from his cell in Kandahar and raised a new army .
Yunus Qanuni Regarded by many as the coming man of the Northern Alliance .
As its interior minister , he will lead the alliance 's delegation to the talks on a future government , scheduled for Bonn on Monday .
He appears to be at odds with Gen Dostam , contradicting the Uzbek leader 's claim to have reached an agreement on the surrender of Kunduz .
Qanuni has also had the confidence to contradict his overall leader , Burhanuddin Rabbani .
He says the Bonn talks can make significant progress , whereas Rabbani had dismissed them as largely symbolic .
Qanuni commands much respect within the alliance .
So much so , that he was chosen to deliver the funeral oration for its revered military leader , Ahmad Shah Masood , in September .
The Taliban Mullah
Faizal
He is the Taliban 's portly assistant defence minister , who wears an enormous black turban and green army jacket .
Mullah Faizal has a ferocious reputation - when his forces captured Mazar - i - Sharif from General Dostam in 1998 , he reputedly presided over the massacre of at least 1000 anti - Taliban fighters .
Mullah Dadullah A top Taliban commander in the besieged northern city of Kunduz , who has allegedly played a leading role in the genocidal campaign against the Hazara people of central Afghanistan ."
2001-12-05,"Three American soldiers were killed and 20 wounded in Afghanistan in a "" friendly fire "" mistake today when a bomb launched from an Air Force B-52 warplane missed its target .
The men were special forces troops who had been assisting opposition forces including those of Hamid Karzai , who has just been named head of the provisional government in Afghanistan .
Mr Karzai was "" slightly injured "" by the bomb , according to reports .
Five Afghan opposition fighters died in the incident north of the last Taliban stronghold of Kandahar , the Pentagon said .
The munition was a 2,000-pound satellite - guided bomb called JDAM , or Joint Direct Attack Munition , and was meant to hit Taliban troops .
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the US president , George Bush , "" regrets the loss of life and wishes the injured a full and speedy recovery "" .
Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said one of the injured soldiers had died en route to a hospital .
She had no details on the seriousness of the other injuries .
Opposition forces - assisted by small numbers of US special operations troops - are trying to overthrow the besieged former rulers of the country north of Kandahar .
The accident produced the worst US casualty toll of the conflict .
The deaths bring to four the number of Americans killed inside Afghanistan in the two - month war .
CIA agent
Johnny "" Mike "" Spann was killed last week in a prisoner uprising while questioning forces captured in the fighting .
Four British SAS troops have also been injured .
The names of the Americans killed and wounded today were being withheld pending notification of their families .
The US defence department said an investigation was under way .
US troops and British special forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for weeks to help forces fighting the Taliban militia , giving them weapons , food and other supplies .
They also have been helping call in air strikes , pinpointing targets for US warplanes .
The news of the deaths broke as US warplanes pounded a suspected cave hideout of terror suspect Osama bin Laden , in mountains south of Jalalabad , in eastern Afghanistan .
Opposition troops battled there with al - Qaida guerrillas , capturing part of a valley below the fortified Tora Bora mountain complex .
As bombs fell from B-52s , dense smoke rose from the White Mountains .
Reporters at front line positions watched anti - Taliban tanks fire repeated volleys at the caves of Tora Bora , named after this village at the mountains ' base .
One tribal commander , Alim Shah , said his Afghan fighters were pursuing a mainly Arab al - Qaida force that was retreating with mortars , rocket launchers and assault rifles to positions above the caves .
"" We are trying our best to capture them alive .
They are surrounded by us , but they are not surrendering , "" Mr Shah said .
Mr Shah said his fighters were meeting heavy resistance .
Escape routes to Pakistan to the east have been snowed in , he added , and the Taliban and al - Qaida defenders had nowhere else to go .
It was not clear whether other al - Qaida fighters were inside the vast network of tunnels and caverns carved deep into the mountainside .
Moreover , there was no news about the whereabouts of Bin Laden , who is accused of masterminding the September 11 terrorist attacks in Washington and New York .
As the battle for Tora Bora raged , Afghan factions in Germany approved the appointment of respected tribal leader Hamid Karzai as an interim prime minister to head a 30-member broad - based post - Taliban cabinet that will take power on December 22 .
The accord was struck after nine days of talks and will secure billions in aid for the war - ravaged country .
As the announcement was made , Mr Karzai was reported to be with his fighters who are part of the push to oust the Taliban from Kandahar ."
2001-12-05,"Rival Afghan parties today made a deal on who will govern their country when the war is over .
The power - sharing agreement , hammered out in over a week of talks in a luxury hotel outside Bonn , Germany , will put two women in the cabinet and Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun leader , at the head of the interim administration .
The German chancellor , Gerhard Schröder , was this morning at the signing ceremony with his foreign minister , Joschka Fischer .
The deal will release western aid to rebuild the war - ravaged country . ""
After all the years of war , terror , suffering and humiliation , the people of Afghanistan now have concrete prospects for peace and for the future , "" Mr Schröder said .
Talks ended after a marathon 10-hour negotiating session led by the UN envoy , Lakhdar Brahimi , to bring the 150 candidates put forward for cabinet membership down to 29 names .
Finding an ethnic and political balance between representatives of the powerful Northern Alliance , the former King and two exile groups , and securing a role for women , was the goal .
The alliance remains in control of the powerful foreign affairs , defence and interior ministries , which it has held since capturing Kabul .
Sima Samar , one of two women , was named as a deputy premier and minister of women 's affairs .
Suhaila Seddiqi , the other , becomes health minister .
Women will also have the vote .
The final cabinet list will not being released , however , until 11 of its members can be contacted to formally accept the posts .
It is believed that agreement was made on Mr Karzai as leader after Abdul Sattar Sirat , his main rival and a close ally of the former king , pulled out of the running .
Mr Karzai , 46 , who was not at the talks , came to prominence fighting the Soviet invasion in the 1980s , and is at present leading a Northern Alliance force of 4,000 men against the Taliban in Kandahar .
He is trying to persuade Taliban commanders to switch sides , a role he has taken since returning from exile in mid - October .
He was also deputy foreign minister in a mojahedin - backed government that emerged after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 , and is head of the influential Popalzoi clan , which has been linked to the Afghan royal dynasty since the 18th century .
Under the UN plan , Mr Karzai 's interim administration will govern from December 22 until a loya jirga , Afghanistan 's traditional assembly , meets in the spring to appoint a government to rule for a further two years until elections are held .
An international security force will be put in place in Kabul and steps will be made to integrate Afghan fighters into a national army .
The final text says the Afghan people have the right "" to determine their own political future in accordance with the principles of Islam , democracy , pluralism and social justice .
"" It also expresses appreciation to Afghan fighters for defending the nation 's independence and to Burhanuddin Rabbani , recognised as president by the UN during the Taliban years , for "" his readiness to transfer power "" ."
2001-12-05,"The new head of Afghanistan 's interim administration is a 44-year - old tribesman who is as comfortable in a suit and tie as a turban and tunic .
Hamid Karzai is from the Taliban heartland of Kandahar , which is where he is today , leading troops in his homeland against the Islamic militia .
He speaks fluent English , and studied abroad .
His recent role in the crisis of Afghanistan Mr Karzai initially supported the creation of the Taliban in 1994 as an alternative to the lawlessness of the warlords who ruled Kandahar .
In 1995 the Taliban approached him to be their permanent representative at the United Nations .
But by then he was disillusioned by the religious movement because he said it had been hijacked by neighbouring Pakistan .
Mr Karzai had his headquarters in Pakistan 's south - west Baluchistan province , but there was regular tension and mutual mistrust .

Haq was captured and hanged .
Mr Karzai was nearly caught but was rescued by US helicopters and special forces .
The defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , said Mr Karzai was "" extracted "" but that he had stayed in the country .
As the Taliban fled the capital Kabul on November 13 , driven southward by Northern Alliance soldiers , Mr Karzai was making deals with Pashtuns in Uruzgan to abandon the Taliban .
He then began moving south towards Kandahar with an armed force of several thousand tribesmen .
In a satellite telephone interview with the Associated Press today , Mr Karzai said he wanted the Taliban 's defeat in Kandahar to be a negotiated one that avoided bloodshed .
A fierce nationalist , Mr Karzai often accused his fellow tribesmen of being pawns in a greater game being played out by Afghanistan 's neighbours , specifically Pakistan .
He accused Afghanistan 's neighbours of using his homeland for their own purposes - Pakistan to train militants to fight in Indian - ruled Kashmir ; Russia to maintain a grip on its Central Asian states .
Background Mr Karzai was born December 24 1957 , into one of southern Afghanistan 's most powerful tribes , the Popolzai .
The city of Kandahar , the spiritual headquarters of the Taliban , was built in 1761 on land given to King Ahmed Shah Durrani by the Popolzai .
Mr Karzai 's father was chief of the Popolzai tribe .
He was assassinated in the Pakistani city of Quetta in 1999 , a killing believed linked to Afghanistan 's violent feuds .
The killers were never caught .
During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s , Mr Karzai was in Pakistan .
But when Islamic insurgents took power from the pro - Moscow regime in 1992 , Mr Karzai became Afghanistan 's deputy foreign minister .
The rebel government , led by Burhanuddin Rabbani , the current de facto ruler of Afghanistan , fought bitterly among themselves , destroying large sections of the city and killing 50,000 civilians .
Mr Karzai left Mr Rabbani 's government in the first years , disillusioned by the bickering between the groups .
In the early years of the rebel government , Mr Karzai asked Mr Rabbani and his regime , which was largely run by minority Tajiks , to incorporate more ethnic Pashtuns , Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group .
The Taliban movement which began in southern Kandahar , originally to end the lawlessness brought by the warlords who ruled , were mostly ethnic Pashtuns .
According to the Northern Alliance foreign minister , Dr Abdullah , the members of the interim administration will be chosen according to the ethnic breakdown in Afghanistan , based on a 1974 United Nations survey .
That survey says 38 % of Afghans are ethnic Pashtuns , 27 % ethnic Tajiks , 17 % Hazaras and 6 % Uzbeks .
Associated Press"
2001-12-05,"What has happened ?
Four Afghan factions signed a pact today to create a new administration headed by an anti - Taliban battlefield commander , concluding a historic agreement aimed at restoring peace and stability to Afghanistan .
Hamid Karzai , a moderate Muslim whose fighters are part of the push to oust the Taliban from their last stronghold in Kandahar , was chosen to head the interim administration .
The agreement establishes a 30-member interim cabinet headed by Mr Karzai - whose title will be chairman - meant as the first step toward a broad - based government representing the range of Afghanistan 's ethnic groups and regions .
This will fill the power vacuum , which came after the Northern Alliance won control of most of the country last month , ending the Taliban 's rule .
Afghanistan has seen more than two decades of war and civil strife since the 1979 Soviet invasion .
Today 's UN - mediated accord was signed after nine days of talks at the luxury Petersberg hotel overlooking Bonn , Germany .
What are the four factions ?
The Northern Alliance , a group representing the former King Mohammad Zahir Shah , who is exiled in Rome , and two smaller exile groups .
The four factions negotiating Afghanistan 's political future sought to achieve a balance representing Afghanistan 's main Pashtun , Tajik , Uzbek and Hazara ethnic groups - and also women , who have been virtually excluded from public life under the Taliban .
Mr Karzai belongs to Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group , the Pashtuns , and is head of the influential Popalzai clan , which has been linked to the Afghan royal dynasty that existed from the mid-18th century until Mohammad Zahir Shah was deposed in 1973 .
The delegations preferred a Pashtun premier to reflect the ethnic group 's predominance in Afghan society .
What else is important to know about Mr Karzai ?
He is now leading a force of some 4,000 men toward Kandahar .
The 44-year - old commander was headquartered in neighbouring Pakistan during the Soviet occupation .
He later served under the then president and Northern Alliance leader , Burhanuddin Rabbani , as deputy foreign minister , but quit disillusioned by relentless bickering .
He returned to Afghanistan in mid - October to try and cause an insurgency among Pashtun tribes against the Taliban and was rescued by the US after being hunted down by Taliban fighters .
Mr Rabbani is still recognised as Afghan president by the United Nations and has been portrayed by Western diplomats as reluctant to step aside for a younger generation of leaders .
However , Dr Abdullah Abdullah , who retains his role as foreign minister in the new cabinet , said Mr Rabbani is now willing to turn over power .
What happens next ?
The consensus on the cabinet triggers a speedy transfer of power in Kabul , scheduled for December 22 , and secures billions in promised aid to reconstruct the country .
Are people happy with the deal ?
The mood appears to be one of happy compromise and relief and there were jubilant cheers at the small signing ceremony .
"" Maybe it 's not perfect , "" said the ex - king 's grandson , Mostapha Zahir , "" Under the circumstances it is something honourable , something good .
I think the future of Afghanistan looks very bright . ""
However , the UN envoy to Afghanistan , Lakhdar Brahimi , acknowledged that the delegations represented only part of Afghan society and urged the new interim leadership to integrate all of the country 's ethnic and religious groups - as well as women .
This reflects the anxiety that despite the excitement at the deal , Afghanistan 's political and ethnic fragmentation will hamper efforts of a cohesive response to the massive challenges ahead in turning it into a modern nation .
And any optimism is obviously tempered by the fact that an enemy force still occupies one of the country 's major cities , in Kandahar .
The Guardian 's diplomatic editor , Ewen MacAskill , said he believed the administration faced a "" rocky road ahead "" .
He said : "" There are likely to be problems with the various warlords - they are not necessarily going to give up their power .
The likes of General Ismail Khan , and General Abdul Rashid Dostum , will not want to give up their fiefdoms . ""
Mr MacAskill added that there had been concern in Bonn that the smaller ethnic groups , like the Hazara groups , had not been given enough power .
Where there any problems thrashing out a deal ?
Yes .
There was intensive haggling over posts which pushed the talks passed their deadline .
Pressure had to be put on Northern Alliance leaders in Kabul to remove this obstacle - and an aversion to having any kind of sizeable international peacekeeping force - all of which had threatened to derail the talks .
How does the administration divvy up ?
With ethnic balance as the primary criterion , Mr Brahimi shuttled among the four factions through the night to cull 30 names from 150 candidates .
The result was that the Northern Alliance controls more than half of the 30 ministries , including the powerful defence , foreign and interior portfolios .
The delegation of Rome - based exiles loyal to the former king received at least eight ministries , including the finance , education and reconstruction posts .
Two women were named to posts , Sima Samar , one of five deputy premiers as minister of women 's affairs , and Suhaila Seddiqi as health minister .
The final Cabinet list was not yet complete by the time the agreement was signed , Mr Brahimi said .
What happens after the administration is set up in December ?
The interim authority will govern Afghanistan for six months until the former king convenes a traditional tribal council , or loya jirga .
Under the framework of the deal , delegates have asked for the deployment of an international security force to Kabul and other parts of the country , and agreed to steps to integrate Afghan fighters into a future national army , and the creation of a supreme court .
It includes language saying the Afghan people have the right "" to determine their own political future in accordance with the principles of Islam , democracy , pluralism and social justice "" ."
2001-12-06,"Hamid Karzai , named yesterday as the head of a six - month caretaker government for Afghanistan , is a highly regarded southern Pashtun leader , enjoying a reputation as an independent - minded nationalist with a pro - western bent .
An unusual figure in Afghanistan , he served in , yet was highly critical of , an earlier Northern Alliance government , and was wooed by the Taliban but scorned them .
He has lived in America and was chosen by the US as the key figure to insert into Afghanistan in an attempt to rally a Pashtun rebellion against the Taliban in the south .
Last month , he returned to Afghanistan from the family home in Quetta , Pakistan , but was cornered by Taliban fighters .
He had to be "" extracted "" , in the dry words of Donald Rumsfeld , the US defence secretary , by American helicopters and special forces .
On Tuesday last week , on the first day of the crucial negotiations in Germany , Mr Karzai told the delegates by satellite telephone that the talks were Afghanistan 's "" path to salvation "" .
In such a traditionalist society as Afghanistan 's , his family enjoys enormous prestige as leaders of the Popolzai clan , which was intimately connected with the royal court for 300 years , until the Durrani dynasty was deposed in 1973 .
A strong patriot who resisted the Soviet occupiers , then Russian backing for the Northern Alliance and Pakistan as the main power behind the Taliban
, Mr Karzai is a dove , rather than a hawk .
Despite leading the anti - Taliban offensive around Kandahar , he has little martial experience , a factor seen as positive in the bid to restore civilian government and curb the power of the ubiquitous warlords ."
2001-12-06,"Afghanistan 's rival parties laid to rest the legacy of five years of Taliban rule yesterday when they finally agreed to set up a power sharing government in Kabul that will include at least two women ministers .
World leaders , led by George Bush and Tony Blair , hailed the agreement under which Afghans from four ethnic groups will share power on a 30-member executive council .
Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun leader fighting the Taliban in their final stronghold of Kandahar , will head the interim council .
This will rule for six months until a loya jirga , or traditional assembly , is convened .
The assembly , which will be opened by the former king , Zahir Shah , will select another interim government which will draw up a constitution ahead of elections in two years ' time .
A peacekeeping force under the auspices of the UN is expected to be sent to Afghanistan .
Before the ink had dried on the agreement , which was signed after nine days of talks in Bonn , there were grumblings from smaller parties that the executive council will be dominated by Uzbeks and Tajiks from the Northern Alliance .
Although the council 's new leader is a Pashtun , the plum posts have been taken by the alliance which seized control of Kabul last month .
These include the foreign , interior , defence and justice ministries .
Anwar Ahadi , of the small Peshawar group of Pashtun exiles , turned down a cabinet post in protest at the "" unfairness "" of the deal .
"" I am not happy with the cabinet , "" Mr Ahadi told the Today programme . ""
The Northern Alliance has been given way too much .
I am a social democrat - I can not justify this to my party . ""
His remarks fuelled fears that the Bonn deal could go the same way as five previous agreements in Afghanistan since 1989 which have all fallen apart .
However , the main groups , whose members applauded as the agreement was signed in the presence of the German chancellor , Gerhard Schröder , insisted that yesterday 's UN - sponsored agreement marked a breakthrough in which the rival ethnic groups were determined to share power .
Mr Karzai told CNN : "" I am grateful to my fellow Afghans for putting their trust in me , for having considered me worthy [ of ] this job . ""
Expressing the hope that the transfer of power would go smoothly on December 22 , the new Afghan leader said : "" I hope very much it will be in the interests of the Afghan people , one that will keep our country good forever . ""
Mr Karzai was selected to lead the interim government because he is a Pashtun , Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group .
Pashtuns have been awarded 11 posts , the highest number granted to any ethnic group .
However , the alliance has won 17 posts because its ministers come from three ethnic groups - the Tajiks , Uzbeks , Hazaras - plus one Pashtun . ""
Maybe it 's not perfect , "" said the ex - former king 's grandson , Mostapha Zahir , a Pashtun .
"" Under the circumstances it is something honourable , something good .
I think the future of Afghanistan looks very bright . ""
The Northern Alliance insisted that the allocation of ministerial jobs had reflected Afghanistan 's diverse ethnic composition .
But Dr Abdullah Abdullah , who holds onto his post as foreign minister , conceded that the Tajik - dominated alliance had emerged with some of the best portfolios .
"" I still have my job .
I expected it , "" he said .
"" There needs to be some sort of continuity as well . ""
The agreement will usher in radical changes on a series of fronts , not least because two women will sit on the new executive council .
They are Sima Samar , one of five deputy premiers who will hold the women 's affairs portfolio , and Suhaila Seddiqi , the health minister .
Burhanuddin Rabbani , Afghanistan 's president and Northern Alliance leader , is also effectively tossed aside .
An aide to Dr Abdullah said that Mr Rabbani , who had dismissed the talks , was "" an old man "" who should retire .
Tony Blair hailed the agreement in Bonn as a "" truly remarkable achievement "" .
He added : "" Afghanistan today has the opportunity of a new beginning , to build a future in which everyone will have a say , no matter what their tribal background or gender . ""
The Taliban dismissed the new government as the "" puppet "" of America .
Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef , the former Tal iban ambassador to Pakistan , told Reuters television : "" This is not acceptable to the people of Afghanistan .
This is only a puppet government chosen by America and other foreign countries for their [ own ] interests , not for the people of Afghanistan . ""
His remarks came as the EU pledged a "" significant contribution "" to the rebuilding of Afghanistan .
Donor nations from around the world also met in Berlin to agree emergency relief aid for Afghanistan .
One British official estimated that it would cost between $ 5bn and $ 10bn to rebuild the country .
· Mohammad Fahim , defence minister in the new government , said yesterday that he would no longer accept foreign troops in Afghanistan operating without a UN mandate .
"" We have refused all deployment of additional foreign troops .
We are capable of maintaining security in the zones under our control , "" he told the French daily Le Figaro ."
2001-12-07,"It is strange to think of a man you used to schmooze with as a national leader .
I first met Hamid Karzai in the summer of 1988 , when I was the Guardian correspondent in the Indian subcontinent .
It was hard for any western journalist sniffing round the edges of the Afghan war not to meet him .
He used to lurk in the lobby of Islamabad 's Holiday Inn hotel , where most visiting correspondents congregated .
He was ever willing to share gossip in the coffee shop , trading tidbits of information and rumours , and gently pressing the mojahedin cause .
Not that he was exactly representative of that cause .
Most mojahids we met bristled with guns and extravagant beards , or else were glittering - eyed Islamist zealots , angrily denouncing the western powers which armed and funded them .
Karzai , by contrast , carried nothing more lethal than a Mont Blanc fountain pen .
His beard was neatly trimmed , he was always immaculately dressed , and his manners were as impeccable as his American - tinged English .
Truth be told , most of us thought him a bit of an irrelevance , albeit a charming one .
He was what we flippantly called a Gucci guerrilla , as opposed to a real fighter , whom we called an HAB .
( The first initial stands for hairy , and the last for bandit .
The middle one is best left to the imagination . )
There were lots of Gucci guerrillas in Islamabad , and in the frontier cities of Peshawar and Quetta .
They generally lived in ostentatious villas , surrounded by armed guards , and their vehicles of choice were 4x4 Mitsubishi Pajeros .
Karzai , to give him credit , was not one of those .
Soft spoken and courteous , he listened as well as spoke .
He never tried to peddle the more absurd claims of the mojahedin - they once claimed to have shot down 66 Soviet aircraft in a single day - and he was infinitely patient with correspondents floundering in the complexities of Afghan politics .
His movement was the Afghan National Liberation Front , widely regarded as the most moderate of the seven Peshawar - based guerrilla groups .
It was , and remains , headed by Professor Sibghatulla Mojadidi , who became first prime minister of the disastrous 1992 - 96 mojahedin government .
Karzai was steadfastly loyal to his leader , but never concealed his true allegiance to ex - King Zahir Shah , exiled in Rome .
Like most Afghans I met , he was irritatingly vague about how the professor , or the king , would ever be installed in Kabul .
In February 1989 , the Peshawar leaders and their followers seemed poised to return to their country in triumph .
The Soviet Union was pulling back its troops , the communist government of Mohammed Najibulla was thought certain to collapse , and the mojahedin were in charge of large tracts of Afghanistan .
The mojahedin alliance summoned a shura , or council , to discuss the future government .
At the insistence of the Pakistan government , the meeting was held in Islamabad , instead of one of the "" liberated "" enclaves of Afghanistan itself .
It was a shambles .
The shura was supposed to last three days .
It dragged on for twelve .
It was fractious , ill - tempered and inconclusive .
It ended with Mojadidi elected - by one vote - to the leadership of a non - existent government .
Throughout the shura , Karzai tried hard to put the best gloss on events , though it was plain that he was exasperated and even embarrassed .
It was the same when , more than three long years later , we finally got to see him in Kabul .
The mojahedin had taken over the city - not by force of arms , but by doing a deal with the military bosses who had ousted Najibullah - and promptly started a new civil war among themselves .
Hamid Karzai arrived in the midst of chaos , still elegantly tailored and looking completely out of place among the throngs of HABs .
He showed us round the relatively modern foreign ministry , where he was to be deputy minister .
It seemed to have only two other visible employees , and there was a neat shell hole in the wall of Karzai 's own office .
That was the last time I saw him .
He was still saying all the right , rational things about reconstruction and modernising the country , even as the artillery boomed in the background .
No doubt he will be saying the right things now , urging the warlords and the international community to give peace a chance .
Karzai apparently tried to cooperate with the Taliban when they swept to power , because they offered some chance of order after the bloody chaos of the mojahedin years .
He quickly became disillusioned with their religious bigotry , and even more by their close ties to Pakistan and to Arab fundamentalist sects .
He and his family returned to exile in Quetta , whence they tried to organise resistance among their own people , the Popalzai tribe which is concentrated around Kandahar .
Karzai 's father , Abdul Ahad , was assassinated two years ago , almost certainly by Taliban agents .
Like most Afghans , Karzai hates the notion of foreign interference .
Unlike most Afghans , he values the notion of restoring diplomatic and economic links with the world .
He is also a passionate believer in national reconciliation , and would always describe himself as an Afghan first and a Pashtun second .
That is an ethos he desperately needs to spread as he tries to hold together the experimental and fragile new coalition in Kabul ."
2001-12-07,"Mullah Mohammed Omar , the Taliban 's elusive supreme leader , hopes to ensure his survival by surrendering to Pashtun elders in Kandahar rather than to the new Afghan leader , Hamad Karzai .
In a final show of defiance as the Taliban crumbled after five years , the militia insisted that it would only hand its weapons to the former mojahedin fighter , Mullah Naqibullah , who was described in respectful terms as a "" tribal elder "" .
"" We have agreed to surrender weapons not to Hamid Karzai but to tribal elders , "" said Abdul Salam Zaeef , the Taliban 's former ambassador to Pakistan .
His remarks fuelled fears that Mullah Omar will try to escape from Kandahar to operate as a guerrilla fighter in the hills of Afghanistan .
This is likely to prove a forlorn hope .
If Mullah Omar is not killed by US warplanes in the next few days he will find it difficult to outfox Mr Karzai , who holds most of the cards .
Half the population of Kandahar - the birthplace of the Taliban - are said to have deserted the city in recent weeks , indicating that the chances of a defiant Mullah Omar surviving are bleak .
Although he does not yet control Kandahar , Mr Karzai made clear that he would accept nothing less than the total surrender of Mullah Omar .
But he gave conflicting signals about whether the Taliban leader would be offered an amnesty .
At one point Mr Karzai said his amnesty would only apply to "" common Taliban fighters "" .
But asked on CNN what Mullah Omar would have to do to secure an amnesty , the new Afghan leader said he would have to denounce terrorism and reject the al - Qaida leader , Osama bin Laden . ""
Mullah Omar must completely distance himself from foreign terrorists , "" he said .
"" They are criminals against the Afghan people - they must leave the country and they must face international justice . ""
Asked what would happen if he refused to comply with his demands , Mr Karzai said : "" We will have to see .
We do not know where he is . ""
Despite Mr Karzai 's harsh tone , his remarks did not go far enough to satisfy the Americans who reject any idea of an amnesty for Mullah Omar , insisting that he should be seized dead or alive .
Donald Rumsfeld , the US defence secretary , said allowing Mullah Omar to live "" in dignity "" around Kandahar would not be acceptable to the US .
Speaking in Washington , Mr Rumsfeld said : "" We have expressed very forcefully to all the so - called opposition leaders who have been opposing the Taliban what our principal goals are and what our views are and at least at this moment , I have not seen or heard anything that would suggest anyone is negotiating anything that would be contrary to what our interests are . ""
In a conciliatory gesture , the defence secretary hinted that Washington might consider a deal in which captured leaders would not necessarily be tried in US courts .
"" We want either to bring justice to them or bring them to justice , and as I have said there are a variety of different ways that that can occur , "" he said , adding he wanted suspected captives to end up "" in the hands of people who would handle the conclusion in a manner similar to what we would do "" .
His remarks intensified the pressure on Mr Karzai , who is planning to enter Kandahar within the next few days after the Taliban have surrendered their weapons to the elders Mullah Naqibullah and Sher Agha .
If they comply with the surrender , they will be granted safe passage home ."
2001-12-09,"Residents of the Taliban 's former headquarters city of Kandahar were last night bracing themselves for a return to the inter - factional fighting that raged there until the Taliban took control in 1994 , as evidence grew that militias were preparing to fight for control of the city .
Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan 's new interim leader , called a shura , or council , to resolve the differences .
But former factional leaders seemed already busy accumulating men and weapons for a return to civil war .
According to Pashtun tribal sources in Quetta in neighbouring Pakistan , commanders loyal to Gul Agha Sherzai , the former governor of Kandahar , who is angry that the city has been handed over to his bitter rival , Mullah Naqib Ullah , has been recruiting men in Pakistan to join his forces .
Gul Agha has a house in Quetta , home to thousands of refugees who have fled Afghanistan 's two decades of conflict . '
I know his commanders were here last week , ' said one source in the city . '
They are actively recruiting and moving men across the border . '
There are conflicting reports over the whereabouts of the Taliban 's supreme spiritual leader , Mullah Omar , who escaped Kandahar , apparently with the connivance of the man who accepted the Taliban surrender , Mullah Naqib Ullah .
The threat of fighting over the spoils comes amid increasing international concern over deepening splits across Afghanistan 's tribal , nationalist and religious divide , despite the agreement to form a broad - based interim government , headed by Karzai , due to be inaugurated on 22 December .
Aid workers and diplomats in the region claim the tensions have hastened Afghanistan 's descent into lawlessness as the Taliban disintegrated .
Already Uzbeki General Rashid Dostum has protested against the way power was shared out by the Bonn talks , making veiled threats of a return to war .
Some sources claim Dostum has had satellite phone talks with Gul Agha to discuss a joint strategy .
Pashtun sources in Quetta allied to Hamid Karzai told The Observer the real problem was Gul Agha , who they claim has enjoyed the support of the Pakistani intelligence agencies .
Until Gul Agha is ' removed ' , they say , there can not be a solution .
At least four groups allied to former Mujahideen commanders appeared to be moving fighters into the city .
At the centre of the dispute is the issue of who controls Kandahar , the scene of two months of ferocious US bombing attacks .
Following his personal negotiation of the surrender of Kandahar , Karzai agreed that the Taliban should hand over control of the city to Mullah Naqib Ullah , who has enjoyed good relations with them for years .
Indeed , it was Naqib Ullah 's agreement to quit Kandahar with his fighters in 1994 that handed the keys of the city to the Taliban .
According to his detractors - including Gul Agha , who reoccupied his old headquarters on Friday - Mullah Naqib Ullah is Taliban in all but name . '
There is a shura in the city now to try to figure out how to control the situa tion , ' said Khalid Pashtun , spokesman for Gul Agha .
He said the council included Hamid Karzai , Gul Agha and Mullah Naqib Ullah . '
Mullah Naqib Uullah is also there , but that is the biggest obstacle , ' Pashtun declared by satellite telephone . '
Right now , we have to convince Mullah Naqib Uullah to stand aside . '
On Friday night , Pashtun all but accused Naqib Ullah of harbouring Mullah Omar and 1,000 followers . '
Our information is telling us that Omar and some other leaders , they are all with Mullah Naqib Ullah . '
As well as forces loyal to Naquib Ullah , Mullah Haji Bashar ( who is based in nearby Spin Boldak ) and Karzai , former commanders attached to the Hezbe - i - Islami leader , Engineer Hekmatyar , occupied Qishla - i - Jadeed garrison on the outskirts of the city .
Reports in the Pakistani media claimed some other unaffiliated commanders , including Kabibulah Khan , had taken control of Taliban tanks and armoury in the Bagh - i - Pul area and moved their fighters to Kandahar .
Ustad Abdul Halim , another former Mujahideen commander from Professor Sayyaf 's Itthead - i - Islami , was also reported en route to the battered city to revive his forces and seek a role in the new administration .
All these commanders had divided Kandahar into fiefdoms until their ejection in 1994 .
They were so hated that the Taliban captured the city and surrounding province almost without a fight .
Evidence has emerged of the devastation rained on Kandahar during the past two months , in particular on the Taliban positions .
One Taliban official said : ' Our defence lines were broken .
Seven times we tried to rebuild them and every time they bombed . '
Rows and rows of Taliban soldiers were killed and we could n't even find the bodies . '"
2001-12-09,"Hamid Karzai stood only a few miles outside the ancient walls of Kandahar and watched a steady trickle of Taliban vehicles fleeing the city .
It was Friday - the Islamic holy day - and Karzai 's prayers had just been answered .
Two days earlier the new leader - in - waiting of Afghanistan had negotiated the surrender of the last Taliban stronghold .
Now it looked as if finally the city would be his without a feared bloodbath .
The chilled air was silent .
The sound of US bombs exploding in the streets was absent for the first time in weeks .
Karzai , a well - educated man with a neatly trimmed beard , watched the Taliban leave his prize .
He later confessed to an aide that he was still confused by his enemy 's lack of will to fight for the city .
But it did not matter .
It was a historic moment .
The battle for Afghanistan had been won .
But if Karzai was confused , what was the rest of the world to think ?
The Taliban movement , whose religious fanaticism seemed to spring from the Dark Ages , had just been crushed by the most hi - tech military power in history .
With the fall of Kandahar the war in Afghanistan is practically over .
A few Taliban guerrillas will probably fight it out in the mountains , and foreign al - Qaeda fighters may be even more determined to make a stand .
After all , they have nowhere to run .
More Afghans - and perhaps more Americans - will die .
But Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef , the former Taliban envoy to Pakistan , summed it up perfectly last week .
After months of breathing defiance , he at last knew it was over . '
I think we should go home now , ' he said .
Yet the war is not finished .
From the start , President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair have talked of the long haul .
That talk has not diminished .
As the generals and politicians relish their victory and savour their first sweet taste of vengeance , the implications of the Afghan campaign are just beginning to become clear .
The victory at Kandahar , negotiated by Karzai and won by American bombs , has marked the beginning , not the end , of the ' war on terror ' .
And it will be a war like no other the world has seen .
Revolution was the last thing on Abdul Jabar 's mind .
Surviving was all that mattered .
Surviving the barrage of US bombs and rockets that had hammered down on his position in Mazar - e - Sharif 's Qila - e - Janghi fort for six days .
But Jabar , an Uzbek fighting with the Taliban , had witnessed first - hand something historic .
It is a revolution in waging war as far - reaching as the invention of the tank and perhaps as pivotal as the spread of gunpowder .
In terms of technology and changing the role of ground troops , Afghanistan has been something new .
It has heralded a way of hi - tech fighting that men like Jabar can not compete with .
He was lucky to escape with only a bullet in his foot .
Hundreds of his comrades were killed during the siege of the fort .
They managed to kill just one American in return .
This new war is combat waged from the air and directed from the ground .
It is not a war fought with battles , it does not have front lines , nor does it have marches or invasions .
It is a war where men - or women - seated thousands of miles away can track the enemy 's every move and then destroy them with a few strokes of a keyboard .
It is a war where a whole country can be put under intense surveillance without being occupied , where no enemy is safe to set foot outdoors for fear of the rocket - armed spies in the sky .
It is twenty - first - century war , served up American - style .
Key to this are the Predator drones .
They symbolise the sterile , hi - tech face of the new war .
Unmanned and armed with Hellfire missiles , they can be remotely piloted from thousands of miles away .
They can spot , identify and kill their targets with minimum risk to American life .
Alongside the drones are the cruise missiles and guided bombs , bigger and better than in previous campaigns .
Afghanistan has shown that - while mistakes will still happen - the technology that guides the explosives to their target has become accurate enough at last to justify the sobriquet ' smart bombs ' .
Just as the bullet changed the face of war and rendered hand - to - hand battle obsolete , so this new technology has altered things again .
With death coming from the sky , infantry , artillery and tanks - the symbols of twentieth - century war - are being made redundant .
Afghanistan saw no repeat of the troop build - up seen in the Gulf War .
There were no massed tank advances .
In the Gulf just 3.5 per cent of bombs were ' smart ' ; in Kosovo that figure had risen to 33 per cent .
In Afghanistan it was 60 per cent .
And it will rise higher still .
The role of troops on the ground has been minimised to a few elite forces positioned to guide the missiles in with lasers , heightening accuracy .
If there is any tough fighting to be done , it will be carried out by local proxies - in the case of Afghanistan the Northern Alliance - guided by special forces liaison officers .
There is now simply no need to ' send the boys in ' .
Early in the campaign a Predator was able to identify Taliban leader Mullah Omar 's jeep .
It took a photo of the licence plate .
Though the US missed the chance to kill him , it did win a propaganda victory by distributing copies of the photo in leaflets along with the words ' We are watching you ' .
Their impact can only be guessed at , but for the Taliban on the ground mass paranoia would seem to have been justified by the facts .
The result of this is that US casualties have been so reduced as to be almost incidental .
Certainly most of these are accidental .
So far just seven US soldiers have died and only one at enemy hands .
That compares with eight journalists killed covering the war .
On the Afghan side , hundreds of Taliban and al - Qaeda fighters have been killed , civilians have been blown to pieces , thousands of refugees created , fortresses levelled and a government overthrown .
Rarely has war looked so one - sided .
Four men have been key to the success of this war - Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , his deputy Paul Wolfowitz , military supremo General Richard Myers and field commander
General Tommy Franks - none of whom doubted that their technology would secure victory .
They have been the heralds of this new era of war - making .
Rumsfeld had decided what kind of long war this would be on 11 September .
Enigmatic , sometimes abrasive , quietly resolute , the Defence Secretary had spent the day helping rescue teams at the Pentagon , moving the length and breadth of his building like the captain of a wounded battleship .
Then he retreated into his lair , alone , taking urgent calls but refusing to emerge for hours . '
That , ' said an aide ' is when Rumsfeld began to prepare his war . '
He is a slightly possessed , haunted , eccentric man ; his enemies prefer to say ' insane ' .
He has been compared to Dr. Strangelove , and his solitary behaviour that day only enhanced the image .
But he is a man with a vision as clear and surgical as the laser beams of the ' Star Wars ' missile defence screen he was appointed to deploy .
This time there would be no ground invasion , no build - up of infantry .
Rumsfeld had decided that the Gulf War was the last that the world 's last superpower would have to fight with tanks and battalions .
At first there were doubts about the strategy .
Many in the Pentagon hierarchy were dismissive of hi - tech war and the theatre of Afghanistan - with its rough terrain and long history of fending off invaders - seemed too tough a test .
Now those critics are as silent as the Taliban . '
Not once , not even when his own generals were having doubts , did he waver .
It never occurred to him that the Taliban would not be crushed , and sooner rather than later , ' said the aide .
The first bombs in this new war landed at just before 9 pm local time in Kabul on 7 October .
They signalled a seven - hour assault launched by planes , submarines and ships .
The last bomb in the battle has yet to be dropped .
US planes yesterday were still pounding al - Qaeda positions around the hilltop stronghold of Tora Bora .
But in between the war for Afghanistan was fought and won .
It will be a campaign studied over the months to come as future operations are planned .
The lessons learned at Kabul , at Mazar - e - Sharif and Kandahar could soon be applied on any one of a number of new stages worldwide .
Afghanistan seems to have been a textbook battle for the new age .
More than a month of relentless , targeted bombing devastated the Taliban strongpoints , wiping out their limited air defence systems in a few days .
Then , step - by - step , the remit of the bombing was increased , moving from anti - aircraft guns , to artillery and tanks and finally to carpet bombing of trenches and troop formations .
Eventually , as the target list was exhausted operations switched to patrolling ' kill boxes ' - areas where planes would wait for the orders to attack as targets emerged .
Only once did US forces deviate from the battle plan .
On 19 October a helicopter - borne force of US Rangers took a compound near Kandahar used by Mullah Omar .
It was the only old - fashioned US ground assault attempted during the campaign and it ended badly .
The Rangers were forced to retreat under heavy Taliban fire .
The lesson was clear .
The old way is too risky .
The stunt was not tried again .
The bombing steadily eroded the Taliban as a fighting force .
It paved the way for the victory in Mazar - e - Sharif on 9 November , when the forces of General Rashid Dostum took the city , through a hole in the lines blasted by US planes .
That triggered the fall of Herat three days later and , on 13 November , the Northern Alliance drove into Kabul , a city that had been abandoned by its Taliban defenders a few hours earlier .
By now it was clear that the Taliban had simply wilted in the face of the new war .
The capture of Mazar - e - Sharif had triggered mass defections .
Overnight whole areas of Taliban territory changed sides at the whim of their commanders .
Black Taliban turbans were swapped for green Alliance military caps .
With their long and brutal history Afghans know many things about war and that includes backing the winning side .
Where they did stand and fight , the Taliban showed themselves to be brave soldiers .
When the US marines landed in the south , an armoured column immediately set out to meet them , eager at last to engage the enemy .
They were all destroyed by air before they got close enough to fire .
In a war won at the push of a button , bravery counts for nothing .
Certainly it seemed that way to the demoralised fighters on the ground .
Thousands of Pakistanis volunteered to defend the Taliban .
Hundreds have been killed , few will ever have seen an American soldier .
Bordar Bagh , 23 , was lucky .
He survived intense bombing of Kabul before fleeing back home to the Pakistani tribal area of Malakand.'I came to fight the Americans but they just killed us from the air , ' he said .
Afghanistan is now reverting back to its warlord past , provinces are being carved off and turned into private fiefdoms . '
It is amazing how quickly the country seems to be falling back to warlordism , ' said Rasul Baksh Rais , of Islamabad 's Quaid - i - Azam university .
Amazing indeed .
And bad news for Afghan civilians .
But for the US it matters little .
What counted was the removal of any sympathisers for al - Qaeda , and no new ruler of Afghanistan - having just witnessed what happened to the Taliban - is going to risk incurring the wrath of the US .
That Kandahar took so long to follow suit after Mazar - e - Sharif owes more to the ethnic tensions of Afghanistan - where the southern Pashtuns feel threat ened by Alliance Tajiks and Uzbeks - than fondness for the Taliban .
As it became clear the Taliban were collapsing the US hunt switched its attentions to al - Qaeda and the hunt for Osama bin Laden .
Three months ago al - Qaeda had a full terrorist infrastructure in Afghanistan - 55 installations in all ( according to a Russian intelligence document ) , training camps , chemical weapons laboratories , homes for wives and children .
There were also 3,000 fighters .
Now bin Laden 's international brigade has been reduced to 1,000 or so diehards .
Many of al - Qaeda 's top men are already dead .
Mohamed Atef , the hard and capable military commander , died in an airstrike three weeks ago .
Dr Ayman al Zawahri , the movement 's ideologue , has reportedly been wounded .
The endgame of this hunt has now homed in on Tora Bora , the impregnable old Mujahideen cave fortress that resisted years of Soviet assaults .
It has not been so successful in this war .
Backed by smart bombs , the rag - tag forces of the Alliance have already cleared out many of the tunnels and caves .
Al - Qaeda is on the run .
So far the victory has been total and swift .
It remains to be seen whether it can be repeated .
In US military circles they are already calling it ' the war of the spacemen ' .
In part because of the hi - tech backgrounds of the Pentagon elite , but also because of the use of satellites in selecting targets .
Certainly at times the al - Qaeda and Taliban fighters must have felt that they were being attacked by beings from some other planet - unseen creatures from way beyond the horizon and with a might way beyond the imagination .
Now the weapons that wrought the Afghan victory are looking for a new target . '
The future is now , ' said former Army chief General Gordon Sullivan .
The battle plan against Iraq is already laid .
Iraqi military installations and communication lines would be subject to the same relentless bombing .
Rebel Shia and Kurdish troops would be backed by Special Forces commandos and air cover .
The hunt for the prey would be similar , albeit in a more difficult urban terrain .
The only major difference , revealed by The Observer last week , would be the deployment of ground troops around oil fields near the Shia port of Basra .
The next stages of the war on al - Qaeda - with or without bin Laden - are also under way .
Surveillance flights are circling the skies above Somalia , looking for camps , training grounds or anything that could be deemed a base - at Somalia 's peril - with a clear possibility of strikes .
US warships are positioning off the African Horn .
In neighbouring Sudan , the Pentagon has dispatched officials to try to intensify intelligence - sharing .
The regime has expelled bin Laden , but still has links to al - Qaeda , with one of his wives being a niece to Islamic leader Hassan Turabi .
The US is reported to be ready to help end the protracted civil war in return for closer co - operation .
A refusal to co - operate would not be countenanced .
The ' You 're with us , or you 're against us ' mentality is still paramount .
Bush is said to be encouraged by his increasingly close relationship with Russian premier Vladimir Putin , and is taking a close interest in Chechen terrorism and even in the links between Colombia and the IRA exposed by the arrest of three Irish suspects earlier this year .
Military advisers have also been dispatched to the Philippines , to supplement a $ 100 million aid package , and pressure is mounting on Yemen to co - operate , especially after the revelation last week that the regime had imprisoned one of the bombers of the USS Cole , only to release him 17 months before the attack .
Other missions have been sent to Uzbekistan , Paraguay , Uruguay and a nominal but wary US ally in Europe , Bosnia .
However , some gaps are starting to show in the alliance between Britain and America in the direction this war will take .
Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and his aides returned from an audience with Bush a week ago struck by one thing : the US administration 's lack of interest in anything other than destroying terrorists .
The British interest in creating postwar political stability comes in a poor second .
Although the political coalition is important to Washington , it is not nearly as central as Blair would like it to be .
Downing Street denies that the US war aims are racing ahead of the tenuous international coalition that has sup ported it .
But Whitehall sources privately concede the war is rapidly moving on to its next stage - like it or not - though they are pressing for a closer look at non - military solutions .
There is much unfinished business .
Even as new countries are targeted and war plans drawn up , there is an unsettling question over the war 's direction so far .
The Taliban did not attack New York .
Al - Qaeda did .
And they are still at large .
Osama bin Laden has not been caught and the US does not seem to know where is .
In the arid mountains of the Afghan border with Pakistan he could still hide for months to come .
And would it matter if he were caught or killed ?
For all that the US war machine has changed beyond recognition , so too has the enemy that it faces .
Bin Laden is already a hero to millions of young and disaffected Muslims around the world .
His face has become an icon sold in markets and worn on T - shirts from Peshawar to Peckham .
If he is martyred - as seems inevitable - others will almost certainly rise to fill his shoes .
And behind them will stand yet more .
Al - Qaeda itself , while shattered and broken in Afghanistan , is designed to withstand the weapons that the US has thrown against it .
The US investigation is running into problems .
Despite more than 1,000 arrests the hunt for the network that planned the 11 September attacks is hitting a brick wall , FBI officials privately admit .
The focus is switching to western Europe where investigators believe many of the top suspects have already been arrested or are being sought .
This week US Attorney General John Ashcroft will visit Europe to bolster co - operation .
More globally , the FBI has moved for the first time to station agents in India and China .
Terrorism has gone global and so has the hunt for the terrorists .
The US has also cracked down on sources of cash for al - Qaeda , seizing assets and winding up businesses worldwide .
But despite the constraints put on its financial networks , there is probably no shortage of day - to - day funds available to its operatives .
Mullah Omar used to store chests of cash under his bed and such tactics are not hurt by freezing Swiss bank accounts .
Even if a cash crisis did hit al - Qaeda , operatives could still raise their own money through crime .
Or simply by getting a job .
When an enemy lives among you , he is harder to stop .
Each al - Qaeda cell can work by itself , it does not need instructions from a central point .
Each member knows what sort of targets they should be identifying .
This is leaderless resistance at its most refined .
It is an organisation that is almost impossible to infiltrate .
Last week the US issued its third terror warning of the war .
Fresh attacks could be on the way , warned Tom Ridge , the US 's Director of Homeland Security , as he put police forces on the highest state of alert .
His words spoke volumes for al - Qaeda 's global reach and the impossibility of predicting its actions . '
The quantity and level of threats are above the norm .
The threats we are picking up are very general .
The sources are all around the world , ' he said .
In attacking the Taliban the US has not come to close to dealing al - Qaeda a mortal blow .
US weapons are like none the world has seen , but neither is the enemy .
Al - Qaeda does not need tanks , camps or artillery , or planes or missiles .
It does not seek to capture territory or invade America .
As much as the Predator drones , the al - Qaeda fighter also has revolutionised the face of war .
This is a whole new world .
The terrorist hunters face huge difficulties .
In the slums of Asian cities , in the refugee camps of Palestine and the madrassas of the Arab world , al - Qaeda is fighting its battles in the minds of its converts .
That is not an enemy that can be defeated by bombs and rockets , no matter how well targeted .
As the suicidal pilots of 11 September showed , al - Qaeda 's main weapon is the will to attack .
And that will is not in short supply .
Bin Laden 's training camps were not full of conscripts but volunteers .
As letters obtained by The Observer from installations in the eastern city of Khost show , al - Qaeda 's fighters were men who were attracted by the Saudi - born dissident 's cause , not his charisma alone . '
We can destroy him with smart missiles and special forces toys for the boys , but destroying the things that brought him all the recruits is well beyond any military operation , ' one Western intelligence source said .
Just as the Taliban , sheltering in their caves , never saw their enemy before it was too late , so too for the victims of al - Qaeda and the other terrorist groups the US now seeks to defeat .
Just ask the family of Adam Winstein , a 14-year - old Israeli boy killed by a Hamas suicide bomber last week .
He had been chatting to four friends on a busy Jerusalem street when the bomber strolled up to them and detonated the explosives strapped to his chest .
None had time to realise what was happening .
All that was left was the bloody remains , the mourning relatives and a new cycle of violence .
The same can be said of the hundreds of civilians killed and injured by US bombs in Afghanistan .
In a Peshawar hospital bed truck driver Fazl Rehman recounted the night bombs destroyed the village of Kakrak , near Kabul . '
All I could see was that all the houses around had been levelled , ' he said .
This may be a new way of war , it may be against a new type of enemy , but the tragedy of the innocent victims - on all sides - remains unchanged ."
2001-12-10,"Hamid Karzai , the new Afghan leader , received a boost last night when rival groups reportedly reached agreement on the future of Kandahar , and a rebel Northern Alliance warlord endorsed Kabul 's power - sharing government .
The deals raised hopes of a reduction in factional fighting as the new power - sharing government asserts its authority throughout Afghanistan .
Mr Karzai , who is due to take over formally as leader on December 22 , was said to have been intimately involved in the negotiations which led to yesterday 's agreement on the future of Kandahar .
Under the deal , confirmed by the Associated Press but not independently by the Guardian , should defuse tensions after a weekend of fighting .
Kandahar will be run by Gul Agha , who was deposed as governor of the city when the Taliban seized control in 1994 .
His deputy will be Mullah Naqibullah , a former Taliban supporter who oversaw the surrender of Taliban forces on Friday .
The agreement should lead to a reduction in violence between forces loyal to the two men , who clashed in the city after the Taliban downfall . ""
God willing , I will run the administration of Kandahar with the advice of the local people , tribal elders and mojahedin commanders , "" Mr Agha said last night .
A spokesman for Mr Karzai confirmed to the Associated Press that a deal had been reached .
The talks are said to have taken place at the bombed - out residence of Mullah Mohammed Omar , the Taliban 's supreme leader , who disappeared after the fall of Kandahar .
Paul Wolfowitz , the deputy US defence secretary , said he believed that Mullah Omar was likely to be near Kandahar .
But he added : "" If you told me he turned up on a ship in the Indian ocean tomorrow , I could n't be totally surprised . ""
The agreement in Kandahar came after three days of violence as rival groups vied for control of the city .
Travellers who left the city yesterday said that as the Taliban collapsed , rival anti - Taliban forces moved in , grabbing any vehicles and weapons they could , looting shops and fighting between themselves as they carved up the city .
Bari Ali , a well - dressed young Afghan from Kandahar , described the surrender of the city as he passed through the Chaman border . ""
Mullah Naqib 's men came in first on Friday with many soldiers , then Gul Agha followed immediately behind him .
They began taking the Taliban 's fighters ' vehicles from them and all their weapons . ""
While Kandahar appeared to be relatively calm yesterday , the situation outside the city and on the rough road to Kabul appeared dangerous and chaotic .
Most of the Taliban 's leaders escaped from Kandahar to take up refuge in Zabul and other provinces in south - east Afghanistan .
At least five pick - up trucks containing Arab fighters were spotted yesterday on the same road .
Taliban fighters are said to be massing in the town of Qalat on the road to Kabul .
The town was said to be still under Taliban control .
The Taliban yesterday formally handed over control of Zabul province , indicating that they will now try to regroup as a guerrilla force . ""
The rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan has totally ended , "" the Pakistan - based Afghan Islamic Press said .
The statement , which marked the formal end of Taliban rule in Afghanistan , came as the rebel Northern Alliance warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostam reportedly agreed to cooperate with Afghanistan 's new government .
Gen Dostam , whose forces were responsible for killing hundreds of Taliban forces at a prison outside Mazar - i - Sharif , had threatened to cut off large parts of northern Afghanistan after his faction was offered a minor post in the new government .
But a senior US official said : "" Dostam said he is willing to cooperate with the interim administration . ""
The apparent change of heart by Gen Dostam , an ethnic Uzbek , will be a significant boost to Mr Karzai , who is a Pashtun ."
2001-12-14,"Afghanistan 's fragile new deal took a step forward yesterday when Hamid Karzai , head of the interim government , entered Kabul for the beginning of what may be the capital 's first peaceful transfer of power for decades .
Mr Karzai landed at Bagram airport shortly after midnight , went to the presidential palace , and by late afternoon was exchanging pleasantries with Northern Alliance leaders .
The capital was relaxed , and although alliance soldiers roamed the streets their leaders said they would hand over power on December 22 , as agreed in the UN - sponsored peace deal negotiated in Bonn .
The need to keep the peace is at the top of the international coalition 's agenda .
Today senior military officers from those countries , including Britain , which are prepared to contribute to a UN - sponsored security force will meet in London to consider its size and composition .
The one - day meeting brings together representatives of France , Germany , Spain , Jordan , Italy and Turkey in what has been called a "" coalition of the willing "" .
Britain , which will lead the force , is to offer 1,500 troops , including a small headquarters staff .
A few hundred British troops , probably marine commandos , are expected to be in Kabul before Christmas , the rest , including paratroopers , following later , military sources said yesterday .
But the decision on the size of the force and its mandate will not be made until after Major - General John McColl , its commander , has had talks in Kabul this weekend with Afghan leaders , including Muhammad Fahim , the defence minister in the interim government .
Mr Fahim has said that he wants only a force of 1,000 to guard government buildings .
Gen McColl - who will liaise with General Tommy Franks , the US head of military operations in southern Afghanistan - will try to persuade Mr Fahim that many more troops are needed .
British military sources said yesterday that the force should be between 3,000 and 6,000 and should be in Kabul for three months .
In the capital yesterday the first snowflakes of winter fell , hailed as a good omen by residents , who left plastic flowers at the palace entrance as a symbol of good will .
The new government is meant to represent all the country 's ethnic and political factions , but disgruntled groups which feel slighted have warned that they may not cooperate .
Civil war , which ravaged Kabul from 1992 to 1996 , could erupt if the governmentfalls apart .
Ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks of the Northern Alliance gained key posts in the interim gov ernment for allowing in Pashtun rivals from the south , including Mr Karzai .
A moderate Muslim and fluent English speaker , he returned from exile in October to rally opposition to the Taliban in his Kandahar homeland .
His job will be to keep the uneasy coalition of mojahedin veterans and westernised exiles together for six months , until a traditional assembly agrees a successor government .
On his first day in Kabul since the Taliban fled , he held private talks with the nominal president , Burhanuddin Rabbani , who has reluctantly agreed to step aside .
He also met Mr Fahim .
Mr Fahim and Mr Rabbani both want to retain influence , having seized most of Afghanistan from the Taliban .
Both have supported Mr Karzai , but they are suspected of regarding him as little more than an American puppet .
Western countries and the UN have acted swiftly to shore up the incoming prime minister 's authority .
The UN envoy , Francesc Vendrell , met Mr Karzai last night after flying from Islamabad .
Soldiers and civilians stopped and stared at the fleets of cars which ferried French and German cabinet ministers and an Italian deputy minister to Mr Karzai .
If the deal holds it will be Afghanistan 's most peaceful transfer of power since the 1973 bloodless coup which overthrew the king , Zahir Shah , a sponsor of Mr Karzai ."
2001-12-17,"The battle for the Tora Bora caves is over .
The Americans are back in their embassy in Kabul .
Hamid Karzai , whose powersharing government will be formally installed on Saturday , is in Rome briefing Afghanistan 's aged , but still revered , exiled king .
Suddenly , the news from Afghanistan has a faintly rosy tinge .
We know there are huge problems ahead , but at last there can be some hope for the future .
There is just one huge flaw in the picture .
Osama bin Laden is still at large .
He could be in the eastern mountains , or in the south .
He might have crossed into Pakistan , where he has numerous followers .
That is all speculation - much more important is the simple plain fact that he is still on the loose .
In a sense , that is more of a problem for the Americans than for the Afghans .
George Bush has sworn to get his man , and failure to do so could conceivably cost him the presidency .
For the new regime in Kabul , there are much more pressing problems : keeping the coalition together , pacifying the warlords , feeding and sheltering the mass of refugees , and maintaining order .
Capturing Bin Laden is a secondary issue .
Almost certainly , the Saudi - born maverick is a busted flush , militarily speaking .
His al - Qaida camps have been destroyed and his private army of mercenary zealots dispersed .
His main remaining asset is his reputation - not that it will do him much good in Afghanistan .
There may be a small minority of militant Islamists who will hide him and even die for him , but there can be little doubt that the vast majority of Afghans despise the man who has visited so much misery on the country that sheltered him .
Afghans do n't hate foreigners - that idea is a cruel calumny visited upon some of the most hospitable people on earth - but they do loathe foreigners who interfere in Afghanistan .
Therein lies the rub .
Bin Laden may be cordially detested , and there is the matter of the enormous American reward for his capture to be considered .
But Bin Laden is not the only armed foreigner around .
At some point in the next five days , the first contingents of an international peacekeeping force will fly into Kabul to keep order while the new regime builds its authority .
That is unqualified good news for 1 m long - suffering Kabulis , but it could spell future trouble for the shattered country .
The presence of a sizeable , part - western military force in the city will be a constant reminder to Afghans that they are no longer solely in charge of their own destiny .
That impression will be reinforced if American , British and other special forces continue the search for Bin Laden .
The US contingent in Kandahar and the smaller British base at Bagram airfield , north of Kabul , have , by all accounts , been received cordially by the local populations .
The Americans have taken to patrolling openly in Kandahar city , and buying supplies from local traders only too pleased to have their custom .
However , Afghanistan remains the most volatile place in the world .
There are simmering tensions between rival factions and ethnic groups , all of them bristling with weapons .
The soldiers of the international force may be splendidly trained and disciplined , but they are not superhuman .
A wrong command , a hasty response , or an unwitting insult could land them , and Afghanistan , in dreadful trouble ."
2001-12-19,"The Conservative leader , Iain Duncan Smith , today poured cold water on the government 's plans to send a peacekeeping force to Kabul , warning that British soldiers could become "" surrogate targets "" .
British troops are due to leave for Afghanistan this Friday to lead an international force to bolster the stability of the fledgling government headed by Hamid Karzai .
Around 1,500 British troops will lead a 4,000 strong force drawn from 13 of Nato 's 19 member countries .
But the Conservative leader again broke ranks this morning , saying UK troops should be pursuing al - Qaida terrorists across the globe , rather than helping the international peacekeeping effort in the Afghan capital .
He said : "" I want to work with the Americans in other countries rooting out terrorism , which is absolutely the right thing to do .
If the government goes down that route they will get our full support .
"" We are absolutely supportive of further prosecution of the war against al Qaida and other terrorism , and we think that is what British troops are best at doing , rather than being static in peacekeeping , "" he went on .
Mr Duncan Smith said he was concerned that British peacekeeping troops would be placed in a difficult position in Afghanistan , because of the presence of UK forces engaged in military action in the same country .
He echoed concerns voiced by four former chiefs of defence staff in the House of Lords , that a peacekeeping commitment might further overstretch the armed forces .
The Conservative leader said : "" I am concerned that there is a mix of roles here .
The Americans themselves are cautious about putting people on the ground for peacekeeping for the same reason .
"" The second point is the period and timescale they are going to be there , because of the high levels of overstretch that exists at the moment , "" he added .
"" I was much struck by the chief of defence staff 's comments when he said we must be careful about getting our hand caught in the mangle .
The military are also deeply concerned about it , "" he said .
Mr Duncan Smith stressed that he would be fully supportive of any British troops if they were deployed , and said that they must have "" the most robust rules of engagement "" ."
2001-12-23,"' Massoud 's way for ever ... and Afghanistan 's too , ' read the words on a painting that greeted guests at yesterday 's swearing - in of Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan 's new leader .
The image of Ahmed Shah Massoud , the Northern Alliance leader killed days before the 11 September attacks , has become the dominant image of Afghanistan 's new broad - based administration .
There are Massoud postcards in the shops of Chicken Street and Flower Street , posters on almost every roadside kiosk ( Massoud as an Afghan Che Guevara ) , a garish painting in the Intercontinental hotel ( Massoud as a young Bob Marley ) .
In all government offices there are Massoud calendars on the walls .
It is not only his image that has triumphed .
His words and thoughts also reverberate through the empty corridors of Kabul 's half - ruined seats of power .
Karzai may be Prime Minister , he may be among the living and hold the keys of office , but Kabul 's residents insist that Massoud is the country 's real leader .
It is not what Karzai will do that people talk of - that is almost too enormous to contemplate - but what Massoud would have wanted .
The Ministries ' new directors and officials answer us in as many words : ' Massoud would have wanted it this way , ' before giving a version of the Massoud prescription .
After decades of devastating wars , Afghanistan 's new government and its partners in the international community are facing the most difficult reconstruction and political stabilisation programme in half a century or more .
And even while proclaiming themselves optimistic about the progress so far , none of the visiting diplomats is staking his reputation on saying that this attempt at national governance will not end as disastrously as all previous ones .
On Friday night , even James Dobbins , George Bush 's special envoy to Afghanistan , made it clear that it was up to the Afghan leaders - not international security forces - to ensure there was the will to prevent a return to inter - factional violence .
In Kabul , locals speak highly of Karzai , who comes from the Pashtun - speaking south , but have put their faith in Massoud .
The quasi - religious imagery of the omni - present posters suggests that many Afghans believe only a miracle , or a kind of saint , might redeem them .
It is not surprising .
International officials say Afghanistan is a country beginning again at ' absolute zero ' .
Their optimism for the future is measured in decades and in progress made in baby - steps , the scale of the task so daunting that few know where to begin , or even how to frame the task ahead .
For ordinary Afghans too - whatever the agreements of the factions to work together at the Bonn peace talks - the present generation of ' political ' leaders is deeply implicated in their country 's troubles .
By being heroically dead , Massoud is exempted from the hazard of being a future disappointment . '
The one thing you can say is that things had got so bad that Afghanistan was at rock bottom , ' a western diplomat told The Observer last week . '
If we are being optimistic , the only place for it to go is up .
There is the promise from the international community of reconstruction aid of up to $ 10 billion , but that depends very much on a national government getting it together and coming up with the goods .
If they do n't , then the stick that goes with that carrot is that the goodies wo n't follow . '
And that is Afghanistan 's biggest ' if ' .
From Kandahar in the south , which has been seized by former factional warlord Gul Agha Sherzai , to the Mazar - e - Sharif , home base of warlord General Rashid Dostum , the new Afghanistan is beginning where pre - Taliban Afghanistan left off - as a patchwork of territories controlled by competing strong men .
Few , even among the most optimistic international officials , believe that the new government will have much sway at first in the lawless provinces outside Kabul .
The question is whether the interim government , slated to hold office for six months until the convening of a loya jirga - grand council - can extend its influence throughout the country .
While diplomats concede that the writ of the government in the first instance will be limited to Kabul and its surroundings , they hope that as it is given international funds for rebuilding , local leaders will have to bend to the central government to access funds , patronage and prestige .
It is an Afghan solution to an Afghan problem in a country where civic society , even in its basic form , does not exist and the political process has been driven by whoever has the biggest gun .
The exchequer was looted by the Taliban , leaving around $ 1 million to run a country of some 20 million .
Education , health and justice systems barely exist .
The majority of the civil servants who once ran them have fled abroad from the decades of war or were sacked or imprisoned by the Taliban and are only now returning .
And Afghanistan is a basket - case economy of the worst kind .
Food production , once the main economic activity , has been demolished , replaced by a principal export that is entirely criminal - heroin .
Lawlessness and violence permeate the country .
Almost every man is under arms .
Reverence for Massoud is reflected in conversations even with UN senior officials . '
I remember in the many discussions I had with him , ' says Fransesc Vendrell , deputy special representative for Afghanistan , ' that the root of all Afghanistan 's problems was lack of a legitimate government , which facilitated interference by the country 's neighbours . '
Vendrell is one of the ' optimists ' among the international officials .
But even he does not underestimate the huge challenges both for Afghanistan and the international community .
The first big hurdle has been crossed , he argues , with the Bonn talks and the composition of a government . '
There are going to be enormous challenges , ' he admits . '
The reconstruction of Afghanistan is going to be far more complicated than anything attempted in Cambodia , Bosnia , Kosovo or East Timor . '
It is going to be a very long process requiring patience and perseverance .
We need to build everything .
We need to build institutions .
We need to build a civil service , a legal system .
We need to build a new police and army . '
The United Nations has committed $ 25 million to finance the salaries of the government in education , justice and other key ministries , where civil servants have not been paid for six months or more .
We visit the new Minister of Education .
The massive bare building is a symbol of the problems Afghanistan faces , not only after years of the Taliban , but after 23 years of war .
Floor after floor is deserted of furniture and people , the doors to the rooms padlocked .
Mohamed Elios Zarra and his entourage are camped out in two large rooms . '
The problem with the education system is that it is destroyed , ' he tells us . '
The Taliban only educated half the population .
Not women and then only the men in Islamic studies .
They wanted to teach the entire country to be terrorists like bin Laden . '
Inevitably , the conversation comes round to Massoud , this time to the curriculum he ordered to be prepared for the schools in the area he controlled . '
Now we have a problem finding teachers - and teachers to teach teachers , doctors and lawyers that we need to rebuild Afghanistan .
No one wants to teach because the salary is so low . '
But if it is the spectral Massoud who provides direction and solace , officials in the new administration are more pragmatic about who will pay for it - the international community .
In every Ministry we are told that the solution lies with cash donations for everything from salaries to rebuilding paid for by the West .
In a country without legal exports or taxable revenues , or anything to borrow money against , it is the only source of revenue .
An example of the financial problems is in the currency itself .
Without an effective central bank , the value is set by the money - changing mafia that has fixed a staggering deflation of the afghani against the dollar from 80,000 to the dollar to 10,000 in a bare few weeks .
In the end , it is an Afghan who sums up his country 's challenges best .
We meet Abdul Kabir , an administration manager for the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan , praying in the waiting room of the UN Office for the Co - Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs . '
Every problem here is big , ' he says . '
Afghanistan has been like a sick man with its violence .
A decade ago everyone ignored our problems .
And if you do not cure that sickness , other illnesses will attack and make it weaker .
We are not post - war .
We are post - health . '"
2001-12-23,"The Afghan people , shattered by two decades of war , heralded yesterday what they hope will be the start of a new era of peace with the inauguration of the interim government of Hamid Karzai .
The inauguration ceremony in Kabul , conducted under tight security in the gloomy , ramshackle Interior Ministry Hall , was the first transfer of power since the fall of Afghanistan 's monarchy in 1973 not to be marked by violence .
The occasion was marred , however , by reports that US Spectre A-130 gunships and Navy jets had attacked a convoy of vehicles carrying tribal elders travelling from eastern Afghanistan to attend the inauguration , killing at least 65 people and destroying 10 houses and a mosque .
US officials claimed its planes had hit a convoy carrying al - Qaeda and Taliban leaders that had fired anti - aircraft missiles at US planes .
Facing a daunting task of rebuilding a country razed almost to the ground by 23 years of war , Karzai took the oath of office before Chief Justice Mohamed Qasim , before embracing outgoing President Burhanuddin Rabbani to loud applause from foreign diplomats and tribal leaders from every province .
Although shambolic , the Afghan officials had done their best to instil a proper sense of occasion .
Arriving dignitaries were greeted by a red carpet in two pieces , and an honour guard wearing rumpled dress uniforms last worn by the presidential guard of murdered President Mohamed Najibullah a decade ago .
Afghan officials had also managed to find 14 brass band instruments - the only ones left in the country , said their commander - and 14 mainly elderly musicians who had been given a day to practise a few halting bars .
Armed soldiers detailed to protect the ceremony , meanwhile , abandoned their positions to crowd around a BBC transmitter truck to catch a glimpse on the monitors of the historic proceedings going on inside the building .
Inside the packed hall , decorated with paintings of the Northern Alliance 's charismatic former leader , Ahmed Shah Massoud , who was murdered on the suspected orders of the Taliban two days before the 11 September attacks , Karzai said : ' I promise you that I will fulfil my mission to bring peace to Afghanistan . '
The 44-year - old Pashtun leader promised that among his priorities would be free speech , women 's rights and the education system , all of which were destroyed at the hands of the Taliban . '
Our country , as a result of the long war , has been distracted .
We need hard work from all Afghans .
Bearing in mind all these difficulties , our country is in need of support from the United Nations and all friendly countries .
We should put our hands together to be brothers and friends .
Forget the painful past , ' he added .
Significantly , the ceremony was attended by all the country 's leading warlords , including General Abdul Rashid Dostum , who had threatened to boycott the ceremony , and by Ismael Khan , the Herat - based Shia leader .
The 30-member interim government , agreed during talks between the four main anti - Taliban factions in Germany last month , will govern for six months until a Loya Jirga , or council , forms another government to run the country until elections two years later .
The World Bank and the United Nations said in a report unveiled in Brussels that Afghanistan will be needing $ 9 billion in aid over the next five years to rebuild .
Among the guests were General Tommy Franks , the US commander who has led the war against the Taliban and al - Qaeda , and Major - General John McColl , the senior British officer who will be commanding the multi - national peacekeeping force for the Kabul area .
For all the optimism expressed by Afghan leaders and international dignitaries , one problem facing the new government is the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden .
Arriving at the ceremony General Franks admitted that bin Laden has not been sighted for a week and could be dead in Afghanistan or may have escaped .
Commenting on the attack on the convoy , Franks said there would be an investigation into the bombing , but added : ' I will tell you , having been in touch with my headquarters , that at this point we believe it was a good target . '
Guests arrived amid tight security provided by Afghan troops backed by a detachment of 20 soldiers from the Royal Marines and Special Boat Service , and dozens of US Special Forces .
The Royal Marines are the advance party of an international peacekeeping force expected to swell to 1,500 in the coming days and weeks .
General McColl told The Observer that one of the first priorities would be to reopen the mined and bomb - cratered Kabul International Airport , close to the city , to act as an airbridge for peacekeeping forces .
He said discussions were under way on the deployment of peacekeeping forces to the major cities outside Kabul ."
2001-12-23,"German MPs approve troops for Kabul
The German Parliament yesterday overwhelmingly voted to send up to 1,200 troops to join the international force protecting the new Afghan administration in Kabul .
Opposition MPs supported Chancellor Gerhard Schröder 's coalition government in passing the measure , despite renewing charges that the Berlin government had failed to match its push for a bigger international role with a major boost in military spending .
Washington visit Afghanistan 's newly chosen interim leader , Hamid Karzai , said yesterday he had accepted an invitation from President George W. Bush to visit the United States .
He was speaking at his first news conference hours after his inauguration in Kabul .
Somali suspects Nine foreigners , including seven Iraqis , an Iraqi Kurd and a Palestinian , remained in detention in Somalia yesterday while investigators tried to determine whether they had any links to Osama bin Laden 's terror network .
Mogadishu police chief Abdi Hassan Awaleh Qeybdid said it was too early to say whether they were terrorists .
Funds for firefighters President George W. Bush plans to propose significant increases in spending on domestic American security in his next budget , but has yet to settle on specific amounts , US administration officials said yesterday .
Congress has approved $ 20 billion this year .
The Washington Post quoted officials as saying Bush wanted to more than double funds for local police and firefighters ."
2001-12-24,"Afghanistan 's interim government held its first cabinet meeting yesterday , a day after its inauguration , to plan the rebuilding of a lawless , devastated country .
Some ministers arrived with heavily armed bodyguards but Hamid Karzai , the local leader plucked from obscurity to head the government , said his team would work well together despite past rivalries . ""
Excellent , excellent .
Absolutely perfect , "" he said in a courtyard of the presidential palace after the meeting . ""
The main theme was security in Afghanistan .
"" Women in burkas gathered at the entrance to chant slogans of support .
Two trucks with a dozen British marines , the vanguard of a multinational peacekeeping force , joined traffic in the heart of Kabul to make a visible but low - key presence .
The interim government , a coalition of rival factions , is intended to last six months before giving way to a transitional government agreed by a traditional council .
It is dominated by the Northern Alliance , whose mostly Tajik troops took Kabul last month .
The west insisted that a ethnic Pashtun politician such as Mr Karzai should lead the administration to give it ethnic balance , despite lacking a power base of his own .
The alliance 's agreement to step aside for the authority is Afghanistan 's first peaceful transfer of power since before 1973 , when the king was overthrown .
The meeting tried to decide how the government could start to help millions of hungry , cold displaced people in a country with no functioning institutions . ""
The meeting went very well , "" said Abdullah Abdullah , the foreign minister .
"" The issues which were discussed were mainly the priorities of the new government , which is mainly security in the country , as well as the revival of the administration in the provinces as well as in the cities . """
2002-01-02,"Foreign governments and international broadcasters are to help the Afghan television industry get back on its feet five years after it was shut down by the Taliban .
Silvio Berlusconi , Italy 's prime minister and media baron , has offered to set up an entire TV station for the devastated country .
And other offers of assistance , mainly for programming , to the country 's interim leader , Hamid Karzai , have come from Iran , India , Turkey , Germany , Japan and China .
The United Nations 's educational scientific and cultural organistion , Unesco , has set aside £ 24,000 to train technical staff .
The head of Afghanistan 's TV station , Abdul Afiz , said he did not know what the Italian offer entailed , but added he would welcome modern broadcasting equipment .
"" I had talks with an official from Italy
but I 'm not sure what was promised , "" Mr Afiz said .
"" Once it gets here , we 'll know more , but we 're waiting for the transport to improve to be able to get it here . ""
Mr Afiz also needs to replace high - quality antennae on a mountain top near Kabul that were destroyed during the US bombing .
Two hundred - watt regional transmitters were moved from outlying areas and mounted on the roof of a hotel , which managed to reach most of Kabul .
Mr Afiz and his team hid some of their equipment when the Taliban swept to power in 1996 and banned all entertainment , including film and TV .
But within hours of the Taliban 's retreat from Kabul on the night of November 12 last year Afghan TV was back on air with a female announcer .
With a new interim administration now in place , television has again become the main source of entertainment in Kabul .
On air between 6 pm and 9 pm with a blend of news , music , sport and movies , the station is watched by 500,000 viewers a night , according to Mr Afiz .
In pre - Taliban times the Afghan TV broadcast six hours a day .
But the broadcaster is suffering from a lack of funds - the station has no advertising and its main source of funding is the ministry of defence .
In return the ministry gets a slice of military programming , broadcasting interviews with soldiers and highlights of the Northern Alliance 's five - year battle against the Taliban ."
2002-01-07,"The prime minister , Tony Blair , tonight became the first Western leader to visit Afghanistan since the Taliban regime fell , flying into Bagram airport for a midnight visit with the country 's prime minister , Hamid Karzai .
Mr Blair and his wife , Cherie , flew in from Pakistan aboard a British Royal Air Force C-130 Hercules with the windows blacked out to avoid possible anti - aircraft fire .
He was greeted by Mr Karzai and British troops at Bagram airport just north of the capital , Kabul .
The short visit to Afghanistan comes at the end of Mr Blair 's tour of the subcontinent , which was largely overshadowed by tensions between India and Pakistan .
The visit is meant to demonstrate a commitment to sticking with the reconstruction of a nation that is now clearing up the legacy of the war that he strongly supported .
A small contingent of 20 to 30 British marines was dispatched yesterday to join the 300 British soldiers already serving at Bagram airport , the ministry of defence said .
"" They are performing a range of tasks including patrols and repairing airfields , "" a spokesperson for the ministry of defence said ."
2002-01-07,"American warplanes resumed bombing Afghanistan yesterday in the wake of Mullah Mohammad Omar 's escape deeper into the mountains , an intelligence failure the US will try to rectify by interrogating its consolation prize : two senior officials , one each from the Taliban and al - Qaida .
At least six waves of bombers attacked targets in eastern Afghanistan 's Spinghar mountain range but there was no word of casualties , said the Afghan Islamic Press .
The interim prime minister , Hamid Karzai , vowed to find and arrest Mullah Omar but intelligence chiefs were divided over how and whether he had eluded Afghan troops at the weekend .
The Taliban leader reportedly broke through the siege of Baghran village on a motorbike , despite the presence of thousands of Afghan troops and American soldiers .
Intelligence officials on an American warship in the Arabian sea were preparing to question probably the highest - ranking member of the Taliban in US custody , Abdul Salam Zaeef .
The former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan was deported from Islamabad to Afghanistan on Saturday and handed over to the Americans .
The UN refugee agency rejected Mr Zaeef 's application for refugee status but his two wives and six children may be allowed to stay in Pakistan .
The public face of the Talib who condemned US bombing at news conferences last October and November could yield information about the networks sustaining Mullah Omar , as well as Osama bin Laden .
As a reflection of his importance Mr Zaeef was the first prisoner to be whisked directly to a ship rather than parked in the US prison camp at Kandahar , where there are 300 inmates .
Later he may be moved to a facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , which will eventually hold 2,000 al - Qaida and Taliban prisoners .
Military police from Fort Hood , Texas , and forces from other US bases will set up the jail in Cuba , the Pentagon said .
Mr Zaeef 's detention was a relief for intelligence officials under pressure from Washington to convert the Taliban 's collapse into high - profile prisoners .
Mr Zaeef is one of the very few top Taliban to be captured .
The Americans also took over custody from the Afghans of Ibn Al - Shayk al - Libi , a Libyan suspected of running al - Qaida 's training camps in Afghanistan and considered knowledgeable about potential hiding places for his former boss , Bin Laden . ""
The big question , of course , is : will they talk ? "" said Stan Beddington , a former CIA terrorism analyst .
"" If they are able to talk , I have no doubt whatsoever they will give a lot of information , particularly in the search for Bin Laden . ""
A US marines spokesman , Lieutenant James Jarvis , confirmed that prisoners at Kandhar were being interrogated .
"" We are looking for things we can act upon .
We remain active in our quest to [ uncover ] al - Qaida and Taliban . ""
The hunt for Mullah Omar veered into farce with reports that the one - eyed cleric eluded 2,000 soldiers surrounding his mountain redoubt at Baghran , 100 miles north of Kandahar .
If true , however , he is becoming ever more isolated , swapping a large force of loyalists and the protection of a local chief for three companions also said to be on motorbikes ."
2002-01-08,"Tony Blair flew with his wife Cherie into Afghanistan under cover of darkness last night in a dramatic midnight mission to show Britain 's solidarity with the country 's cross - party government and to rally British troops .
Amid chaotic scenes and unprecedented security , the prime minister became the first western leader to visit Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban when he arrived at the Bagram airbase in an RAF C-130 Hercules troop carrier .
As the Blairs stepped off the plane in freezing temperatures , to be greeted by Hamid Karzai , the leader of Afghanistan 's interim government , they were mobbed by television crews , who had to be beaten back by armed US and British troops .
The windows of their plane , which was bristling with anti - missile weaponry , had been blacked out during the flight from the Pakistani capital Islamabad to protect Mr Blair against an attack by rogue Taliban forces .
The tight security served as an uncomfortable reminder for the prime minister that the allies have failed to achieve two of their key war aims - the capture of Osama bin Laden and of the Taliban leader , Mullah Mohammed Omar .
Mr Blair , who briefed President Bush hours before his trip , admitted that the allies still faced a huge task when he said : "" It is true that until our objectives are met our mission is not complete .
But substantial progress has been made . ""
Mr Blair embarked on a frantic round of talks during his visit , which was to last only a few hours , assuring Mr Karzai that the west would not make the mistake of abandoning the country again .
"" Afghanistan has been a failed state for too long and the whole world has paid the price - in the export of terror , the export of drugs and finally in the explosion of death and destruction on the streets of the USA , "" he said .
"" It is all in our interests that Afghanistan becomes a stable country , part of the international community once more . ""
Denouncing the Taliban as the world 's "" most brutal regime "" , Mr Blair added that he regretted the west had waited until the events of September 11 to take action .
"" If there is any criticism of the international community it is not that we acted when we did , but perhaps that we should have acted sooner .
"" The prime minister was attempting to strike an upbeat note , insisting that a huge amount had been achieved .
"" If you go back to the appalling events of September 11 people were sceptical about action in Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" Some people said there would be a humanitarian , military and political disaster .
Now we are able to see that as a result of the strength of the international coalition we have managed to achieve more than people could have dreamt of . ""
In a reference to the Bin Laden video in which the al - Qaida leader gloated over the attacks on New York and Washington , Mr Blair said the guilt of the terror network had been established "" beyond doubt "" .
"" The coalition put together a carefully targeted military campaign aimed at destroying the terrorist training camp , then the Taliban 's military infrastructure and finally attacking their frontline troops , "" he said .
"" The result has been the destruction of the al - Qaida network inside Afghanistan and the fall of the Taliban . ""
After tasting at first hand the anger in the Muslim world at the allies ' campaign , when Islamists protested against his visit to Bangladesh , Mr Blair said the widespread support for the new Afghan government had shown that the west was not at war with Islam . ""
The joy that followed the fall of the Taliban nailed the lie that ours was a war against Islam , "" he said .
"" We were always on the side of the Afghan people against the Taliban and we remain on the side of the Afghan people today .
This country faces a huge task of reconstruction and we will play our role in that .
"" The prime minister also met Major - General John McColl , the British commander of the newly formed international peacekeeping force , and was shown Britain 's contribution when he met some of the troops who will join the 4,500-strong force .
In an address to British troops guarding Bagram airbase , Mr Blair was to offer his thanks for their "" brilliant work "" .
"" I want to say a special word of thanks to the British forces , "" he said .
"" We have some of the finest forces in the world and both in the offensive operation against the Taliban and al - Qaida and now in the [ international force ] they have acquitted themselves brilliantly . ""
The role of the troops from the 3rd ( United Kingdom )
Division in Wiltshire was only formalised last week when Major - General McColl signed an agreement with the Afghan interior minister , Yunis Qanuni .
Britain is to contribute 1,500 troops , including members of the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment and 16 Air Assault , who have been charged with patrolling Kabul and guarding Bagram .
The late - night visit to the airbase , in which Mr Blair became the first British prime minister to visit Afghanistan , was the result of weeks of planning by security chiefs .
But clearance was only given at the last minute when the British army in Kabul said it was confident the prime minister would be safe .
Downing Street dismissed suggestions that the visit was a publicity stunt to silence critics at home .
"" It is vitally important that the message gets through to the Afghan people that we are in this for the long term , "" one source said .
The Afghan stopover capped a hectic 24 hours in which the prime minister was to visit four countries .
He kicked off his day in New Delhi when he opened a joint British - Indian science festival , then left for the airport to fly to Islamabad in the Hercules .
After meeting Afghan women who had been brutalised by the Taliban he held talks with the Pakistani leader , General Pervez Musharraf .
After dinner Mr Blair boarded the Hercules again for the hour - long flight to Bagram .
At the end of the brief visit the Blairs were to fly out of Bagram in the early hours to Muscat , the capital of Oman , to rejoin the British Airways 777 which has ferried them around the subcontinent for the flight back to London .
In the Hercules , the prime minister 's 18-strong party and the travelling press had to make do with four rows of canvas seats lining the length of the aircraft .
During the flight into and out of Bagram , troops watched for any hostile movement .
A chaff dispenser threw foil out of the back of the plane as a precaution to force any missiles off course ."
2002-01-10,"Tony Blair , trying not to look triumphant as he was flanked by the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai and surrounded by British troops at Bagram airbase on Monday , roundly dismissed those who were sceptical about what military action could achieve .
As American bombers continue to bomb targets identified as remnants of Taliban and al - Qaida forces , and their ammunition dumps , risking more civilian casualties , he added that the war would not be over until Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar were caught .
This , after all , was the prime objective emphasised repeatedly by both Bush and Blair .
Yet with the mullah reported to have escaped on a motorbike and Bin Laden , at the time of writing , nowhere to be seen , the Pentagon now says it is winding down its search for them .
On Tuesday , a Pentagon spokesman said American forces were going to stop "" chasing the shadows "" of Bin Laden and Omar .
Rear Admiral John Stufflebeem declared that American - led forces were focusing more on finding and attacking remaining Taliban and al - Qaida members .
The bombing continues long after "" enemy forces "" , by Blair and Bush 's own admission , have been routed .
Bombing will not bring anyone to account , or to justice - the words used by Bush and Blair - nor will it provide them with more intelligence about any threat still posed by al - Qaida .
As Donald Anderson , chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee has said , now that the main battle is over , continuing air strikes seem very much like revenge tactics . ""
If we value Afghan life as much as American , "" he says pointedly , "" we will have to be extremely careful . ""
Now the bombing has become so routine that it is relegated to the inside pages of newspapers or not recorded at all , in much the same way as the continued bombing of Iraq by American and British pilots over the southern and northern "" no - fly "" zones .
But is the world a safer place ?
Is the outcome of the military campaign in Afghanistan a victory for civilization , as Bush - Blair rhetoric maintains ?
The American military have been given a huge boost , and the promise of a large budgetary increase to procure new and more powerful bombs , including bunker - busters whose performance in Afghanistan has disappointed the Pentagon .
Their tails up , they are threatening to strike at other easy targets .
But this new - found enthusiasm for military strikes ignores a broader point about western policy , made succinctly by Field Marshal Lord Inge , a former chief of defence staff , just before the Christmas recess .
The "" ongoing crisis between Israel and the Palestinians , "" he told the Lords , "" deserves as much direct attention from America and Europe as does the war against international terrorism .
While there is no sign of establishing a viable Palestinian state , the terrorists of the al - Qaida organisation will continue to believe that they have a cause .
"" Even complete military success in Afghanistan will not destroy the terrorist threat .
Steven Simon and Daniel Benjamin , senior staff at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , question whether advances in communications and encryption - coupled with increasingly good tradecraft - obviates the need for al - Qaida to have any territorial base .
In the latest issue of the IISS journal , Survival , they ask : "" Can al - Qaida , or its successor , make the transition from from quasi - virtual to completely virtual state ? ""
Meanwhile , actual Middle East states are growing economically at two - thirds the rate of other developing countries , even more slowly than sub - Saharan Africa .
In 1980 , Muslims accounted for 18 % of the world 's population .
If present trends continue , they will constitute 30 % by 2025 , say the authors .
A "" new youth bulge "" will hit countries throughout the Arab world and beyond .
"" There is little reason to believe that ruling elites will offer a route to political self - expression that does not go through the mosque and madrassa , "" they say .
"" An integral part of this religious orientation will be resentment , even hatred of western societies .
The globalisation juggernaut of cultural intrusion into these traditional societies will certainly fuel this hatred and make religious terrorism even more likely .
"" There is nothing inevitable about this .
Much will depend on the increasingly uncertain relationship between the west and autocratic Arab regimes , notably Saudi Arabia .
It will depend on their economic and social policies .
One thing is certain - as Britain 's top military figures appreciate even if their counterparts in the Pentagon do not - there is no military solution to the fight against terrorism , and no military deterrent to prevent it .
This is the context in which the military action in Afghanistan praised by Blair must be seen .

2002-01-20,"When Colin Powell went to Kabul last week to declare America 's undying commitment to Afghanistan , the new rulers radiated delight and the interim leader , Hamid Karzai , thanked Washington for freeing his land from an ' occupation of terror ' .
But one Cabinet Minister dared to be less than congenial , presenting the US Secretary of State with the uncomfortable fact that Washington bombed the country for more than 100 days . '
I called for the US to pay for 75 per cent of the reconstruction of Afghanistan , ' said Sima Samar , the Women 's Affairs Minister , who was part of the delegation meeting Powell on Thursday . '
I said at least the donations should be equal to the cost of the bombs dropped on Afghanistan . '
The time of reckoning for America and its allies comes tomorrow in Tokyo , when an international donors ' conference will elicit pledges of support for Afghanistan .
After 23 years of war , a four - year drought has worsened things further .
The United Nations estimates the cost of saving Afghanistan from the ravages of war , drought and poverty at $ 15 billion over the next 10 years .
International donors are expected to pledge as much as $ 3bn for the first few years of reconstruction , including $ 500 million from Japan , and $ 350 m from the European Union .
Though Powell said only that the US would make a ' significant contribution ' , reports in Japanese papers at the weekend spoke of $ 400 m .
Afghans are holding their breath - as are diplomats in Kabul where there have been mutterings that President George W. Bush may prove unwilling to pay for rebuilding Afghanistan now that the focus of the war against the Taliban and al - Qaeda is shifting to Guantánamo Bay .
The sums pledged are crucial to the credibility of Karzai 's administration .
Its immediate aims are modest .
It is still trying to collect on $ 20 m in pledges for a fund to pay back wages to civil servants and police .
At $ 30 a month , it was initially estimated that would keep more than 200,000 civil servants at the poverty line .
It was thought the money would arrive when the interim administration was installed in Kabul on 2 December .
They are still waiting .
As of Friday , they still had only $ 9 m .
Meanwhile , after redoing the head count of civil servants and studying the wild fluctuations in the exchange rate , UN officials realised that Karzai would need $ 100 m just to cover the payroll for the next six months .
The delay in the raising of the start - up fund , and the dawning realisation of the true scale of the devastation , has caused great unease in Kabul .
Several Ministers openly say that they fear the interim government - bankrupt and paralysed - will be unable to achieve even the tiniest improvement in the lives of ordinary Afghans . '
We are starting right from zero , ' said Rasul Amin , Afghanistan 's new Education Minister .
Staff at international organisations are concerned that the government 's cash crisis , and its resulting powerlessness , could provoke an outbreak of the factional fighting that beset Kabul 10 years ago and killed 50,000 Afghans in four years . '
It 's very important to press ahead to avoid a reversion to the bad old days , ' said one . '
We have to act quickly before the window of opportunity closes . '
If not , he added , regional leaders will find it difficult to resist the pressures exerted by Iran , Russia and Pakistan . '
This country is bankrupt .
In comes country X , saying I will send you this , and pay for this project .
It is a great temptation .
This lack of assistance enables neighbours to come in and offer bilateral assistance directly to their favourites . '"
2002-01-21,"Britain will pledge £ 200 m over the next five years for the reconstruction of Afghanistan as donor nations gather in Tokyo today to thrash out how much and for how long the international community is willing to pay for peace .
The UK is among more than 60 countries and global institutions at a two - day conference which will draw up plans for economic rehabilitation through discussions with aid workers and the fledgling Afghan administration of Hamid Karzai .
According to a preliminary estimate by the World Bank and the United Nations to be presented to delegates today , the war - ravaged country will need about $ 15bn ( £ 10bn ) over the next 10 years .
However , it is far from certain that this target will be achieved , with differences among donor nations about the size , duration and form of the international commitment , as well as uncertainties about the long - term viability of the Karzai government .
The full package of pledges will be announced tomorrow afternoon and is likely to reflect differences among the four co - chairs and main donors - Japan , the US , the European Union and Saudi Arabia .
According to sources , the EU expects to announce a five - year plan of support worth about € 10bn (
£ 6bn ) , most of which will go to a World Bank trust fund to finance the running of the Afghan administration .
Japan has indicated it will initially offer about £ 350 m , mostly in the form of bilateral aid , for the 30-month term of the interim government .
The US - which will be represented by the secretary of state , Colin Powell , and the treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill - has said only that it will make a "" substantial "" pledge , initially just for one year .
Saudi Arabia , where Mr Karzai stopped off on his way to Tokyo , has reportedly pledged £ 14 m as a first instal ment of emergency aid even though it was a former ally of the Taliban regime .
Like the US , it is expected to provide most of its contribution through bilateral channels .
The UK 's pledge , which is in addition to a fifth share of any EU donation and the £ 60 m already provided by the Department for International Development since September 11 , aims to set an example of long - term support .
Clare Short , minister for international development , said Afghanistan would not have the capacity to spend large sums of money until the administration was firmly established .
"" We are trying to get every one to commit multi - year , "" Ms Short said .
"" With no functioning ministries , we ca n't even talk about reconstruction .
At first , it will be a case of humanitarian aid .
The bigger spending will come later . ""
Afghan delegates , who will submit an alternative needs estimate , believe the Tokyo conference is their best chance of securing funds before the attention of the world moves elsewhere .
"" One thing I would like to say with certainty , with clarity , that is we need your help , "" Mr Karzai told delegates at a welcome reception .
"" We need your help to bring a new life for those millions of children and women and wounded and disabled victimised by years of trauma and terrorism , "" said the Pashtun tribal leader who took office last month after the US - led war toppled the Taliban .
"" Help us begin a new life , help us stand again on our feet to make a country that will pursue its own values and traditions and will also contribute to a world community in terms of providing a better peace and work against terrorism , "" Mr Karzai said .
Mr Karzai 's administration desperately needs cash to pay civil servants , provide services and win over a sceptical public .
The scale of the challenge is formidable : 23 years of war have devastated Afghanistan 's infrastructure , displaced 5 m people and left the country littered with mines and unexploded ordnance .
According to the World Bank , life expectancy is just 44 years and one in four children die before the age of five . ""
The needs are unlimited , "" said Philippe Dongier , who helped to draw up the preliminary needs assessment .
"" But we have tried to identify areas for immediate action as a basis for pledging . ""
The Afghan delegation believes the first step should be to bankroll a national army .
Omar Samad , spokesman for the Afghan foreign ministry , said : "" This is the top issue .
Without security , there can be no reconstruction . """
2002-01-22,"Extracts from the speech by Hamid Karzai , chairman of the interim administration of Afghanistan , to aid donors in Tokyo War and terrorism "" For the past 23 years , we have suffered the misery of war , repression , and gross abuses of human rights , and an interpretation of Islam that deviates from its true meaning of tolerance and justice ...
Due to many years of war and foreign interferences , Afghanistan was turned into a launching pad for terrorism against the Afghan people and the international community . ""
Fears ""
We have one fear - that without a full partnership with the international community , Afghanistan may falter again .
In an environment of inadequate security , fragmented governance , the non - integration of Afghan returnees , Afghanistan could remain a source of instability to the world and the region . ""
Financial crisis "" Afghanistan is facing a monetary crisis .
Trillions of Afghan currency has been printed ...
We request all nations to forgive any debts to them that may have been incurred by previous regimes .
We hope that multilateral financial institutions will find ways to restore Afghanistan to full membership quickly .
It is an almost unprecedented situation where an administration has no immediate source of revenue . ""
Corruption ""
We are fully committed to accountability , transparency and efficiency in the use of financial aid .
We will hire a reputable international firm to audit our expenditures . ""
Lost generation "" Twenty - three years of war means that there is a lost generation that has known only war and had been denied all forms of opportunity ...
We have a concrete target to get 1.5 to 2 m of our boys and girls back to school and to open the doors of Kabul University and other institutions of higher learning on March 21 . ""
Rebuilding "" Our country today is compared to a wasteland .
The establishment and rebuilding of the energy sector , transportation , communications and irrigation systems will be a huge task ...
We are looking to the local and international private sectors to take the lead in areas such as telecommunications , mining , energy and transportation . ""
Security "" Security and development are two sides of the same coin because over 1 m Afghan combatants can not be absorbed into the mainstream of society and economy without imaginative developmental efforts .
We are committed to establishing a small , effective , disciplined security apparatus that is subject to the rule of law , accountable to the citizens and committed to respect universal human rights . """
2002-01-22,"Hamid Karzai 's interim Afghan government is in a race against time that it could easily lose .
This week 's pledging conference in Tokyo has brought some welcome promises of swift international assistance that , if fulfilled , will exceed the initial $ 1.7bn needed this year .
The World Bank , the UN and the Asian Development Bank estimate that Afghanistan 's humanitarian and reconstruction requirements may total $ 20bn over a decade .
Whether that more ambitious target is met will depend on sustained political willpower long after the recent conflict fades from public consciousness .
That is why the development minister , Clare Short , is right to stress the importance of multi - year pledges .
Britain is to contribute $ 280 m over five years , on top of its 20 % share of the EU 's $ 1bn package and the $ 84 m it has donated bilaterally since September 11 .
This is generous by previous standards and an earnest , perhaps , of what Tony Blair in Bangalore meant about being a force for good in the world .
The US , in contrast , while stumping up $ 296 m , has declined to commit itself beyond the current fiscal year .
This approach will inevitably raise questions about America 's staying - power .
The Bush administration 's attitude is but one of several factors that will determine whether Mr Karzai survives long enough to make good use of the money flowing from Tokyo .
As previously noted , Afghanistan is primarily of interest to the US as a hunting ground for al - Qaida suspects .
The US refusal to join the British - led stabilisation force and its apparently escalating proxy war with Iran around Herat in the west bodes ill for future security .
So , too , does its policy of bolstering local chiefs and warlords in its quest for terrorists at the expense of central authority .
Factionalism , banditry and crime are reportedly on the rise in many parts of the country away from Kabul , especially in the Pashtun south .
Next week George Bush may seek to parade Mr Karzai before Congress at his annual state of the union address .
Blatant domestic political opportunism may be detected , too , in the degrading , vengeful circus sideshow at Guantanamo .
Oblivious perhaps to the big picture , Mr Bush should be told that Afghanistan 's much heralded democratic age has yet to dawn and money alone will not make it do so .
The attitude of Afghanistan 's neighbours , now their expedient consensus on Taliban - toppling no longer binds them , also threatens hopes of rehabilitation .
There are signs that not only Iran but Russia and Pakistan , too , may be reverting to their old influence - peddling ways .
Meanwhile , at the purely human level , a refugee crisis is building again on the eastern border even as Pakistan talks of an enforced , mass repatriation .
The World Bank estimates over 7 m Afghans remain at risk of starvation , despite all recent efforts .
Mr Karzai 's government , unable to offer redress , could soon forfeit popular respect .
If that happens , the Bonn process leading to a loya jirga and then elections may simply collapse .
The money will be too late - and , in a way which Mr Bush seems totally unable to understand , the war will have been lost .
Acting in concert to help Mr Karzai 's government to assert a genuine national authority ; eschewing wasteful , high prestige bilateral aid deals ; and empowering ordinary Afghans at all levels to start remaking their country by placing them , rather than the rich donor countries and their agencies , in charge of the process : these are the urgent priorities to which all who say they care must now apply their best , altruistic efforts .
Time is short .
After all , in only a couple of months , the Afghan fighting season reopens ."
2002-01-22,"Donor nations closed a Tokyo conference on Afghanistan 's future today by announcing $ 4.5bn ( £ 3.15bn ) in aid for a country still vulnerable after nearly three decades of war .
The leader of Afghanistan 's interim government , Hamid Karzai , had to take the bad with the good in Tokyo , suffering a minor car accident on the Japanese capital 's crowded roads , but was assured of the world 's long - term support for Afghanistan 's reconstruction .
He warned donor nations that money will need to start flowing immediately to pull Afghanistan back form the brink of chaos .
In recent days , thousands of refugees have fled their homes for camps on the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , fearing for their safety and lacking basic supplies .
Mr Karzai told delegates : "" We are happy with the results of the conference .
I also hope the pledges that were made by the international community are made true immediately in the coming days . ""
The aid payments pledged for the first year , $ 1.8bn , exceeded the UN 's estimated requirement of $ 1.7bn .
The picture became somewhat less clear for the future , as some nations made only short - term pledges but promised further aid in the years to come .
Mr Karzai cautioned donor nations that it will take time to restore the country to a "" normal way of life . ""
He said : "" We are almost beginning from scratch .
It 's an endless list of misery for Afghans . ""
Mr Karzai said his government 's priorities for assistance include paying the new administration 's bills , providing education , ensuring health services and rebuilding infrastructure .
He also promised to rein in crooked public servants , saying he would be a "" samurai against corruption "" .
The effect the money will have was immediately apparent in the government ministries of Afghanistan , where civil servants were rejoicing today after being paid for the first time in six months .
"" I am very , very happy , "" said finance ministry employee Abdel Jami , clutching his pay for the second half of December and the first half of January .
The pay packet was 1.4 m afghanis , or $ 28 , an average government salary .
The World Bank and the UN have estimated that $ 15bn would be needed over a decade to rebuild Afghanistan , with $ 5bn in the first 30 months and about $ 10bn in the first five years .
Afghanistan 's finance minister , Hedayat Amin Arsala , was optimistic that donor nations would come through with enough money to meet the country 's needs over the next decade .
"" This $ 4.5bn is only a very partial indication , in our view , of these five - year commitments or the 10-year commitments , "" he said .
Some of the major donations included a pledge from Iran for $ 500 m over the next five years , $ 500 m from Japan over two - and - half years , another $ 500 m from the EU for this year , and $ 220 m from Saudi Arabia over three years .
The United States total came in at only $ 296 m of aid in the first year , although the US secretary of state , Colin Powell , indicated that more money would be forthcoming for specific projects in the future .
In a concurrent meeting focussing on landmines , Afghanistan won pledges of $ 27.2 m in mine - clearing assistance .
An official from the US state department said that money was in addition to the $ 34 m already promised by several developed countries .
Mr Karzai will now travel to Beijing for a meeting with the Chinese premier , Zhu Rongji , both to discuss the reconstruction and to improve relations between the two countries .
China promised just $ 1 m in aid in Tokyo , but Afghanistan 's representative to China , Abdul Basir Hotak , said he expected Beijing to announce further money during Mr Karzai 's visit ."
2002-01-22,"Aid donors slapped themselves on the back and Afghan 's new leaders declared themselves thrilled yesterday as the international community pledged a bigger - than - expected $ 3bn ( £ 2.1bn ) downpayment on the bill to rebuild the war - ravaged nation .
But the mood of euphoria at the reconstruction conference in Tokyo was tempered by warnings that the short - term cash could prove the downfall of the fledgling administration of Hamid Karzai if it is not delivered quickly and followed up in the long term .
The day started with a moving plea by Mr Karzai:""For the past 23 years , we have suffered the misery of war , repression and gross abuses of human rights , and an interpretation of Islam that deviates from its true meaning of tolerance and justice . ""
He called on the international community not to forget Afghanistan again , saying donors had to move fast and stay the course to ensure that the country did not slip back into chaos .
The United Nations and World Bank estimate that Afghanistan will need $ 15bn ( £ 10.5bn ) over the next 10 years to rebuild a nation in which life expectancy is 44 years , only 3 % of girls go to school and about 5 m people are displaced from their homes .
As the pledges began to roll in from the 60 nations and international institutions , it quickly became clear that the conference would make a strong start to the long haul of reconstruction , while leaving big question marks about the willingness of most nations to continue their support after three years .
Britain was among the first to announce its pledge - £ 200 m over five years - but only the European Union and Iran made similar long - term promises of support .
Japan weighed in with $ 500 m for the two and a half years ; the European Union $ 1bn over five years , Saudi Arabia , $ 220 m for the next three years , Germany ' € 320 m over four years , while Canada , India , South Korea and Norway were also big donors .
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank each chipped in $ 500 m in grants or loans , conditional on the approval of shareholders .
Despite spending billions on the war , the United States promised only a $ 296 m , one - year contribution to the peace .
The Washington Post yesterday reported that only $ 100 m of that figure was new money , with the other $ 196 m having already been pledged to various projects .
The US secretary of state , Colin Powell , assured delegates that Washington was in it for the long haul . ""
Present Bush has made it clear that the United States will not abandon Afghanistan , "" he said The US treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , indicated that continued support would be threatened if there were any signs of corruption .
Representatives of Afghan 's month - old administration said they would hire an international auditing firm to ensure that the donations were fully accounted for .
"" This is a very good start for us .
We are starting from zero and the only way for us to gain credibility is to get money , "" said Torek Farhadi , economic adviser to Mr Karzai .
Deciding how the money will be spent is the next potential stumbling block for Afghanistan .
The administration wants a central budget to pay civil servants , who have not received wages for six months , and to fund a new army and police force to restore order .
But three of the biggest donors - the United States , Japan and Saudi Arabia - plan to earmark funds for specific projects rather than bolstering central government funds .
Clare Short , Britain 's minister for development , said this could pose a threat to the fledgling administration .
"" We must n't undermine Karzai by doing everything bilaterally .
The pledges are better than almost anyone expected , but they have to be used in a way that allows Karzai to be seen to be powerful . ""
Britain supports the World Bank 's plans to establish a trust fund to finance the running of the government until the country 's tax base is restored .
James Wolfensohn , president of the World Bank , expressed hope that the Tokyo conference showed that the world had learned a painful lesson from the terrorist attacks .
"" If people have n't learned from September 11 that overseas assistance is a domestic issue , then we are in deep trouble , "" he said ."
2002-01-23,"Countries promising aid to Afghanistan gave warning at their conference in Tokyo yesterday that their $ 4.5bn ( £ 3bn ) vote of confidence in Hamid Karzai 's interim government could be withdrawn as quickly as it was offered if the country did not make progress towards democracy .
Sadako Ogata , Japan 's special envoy on Afghanistan who chaired the two - day conference , said the cash was conditional on all the country 's warlords and ethnic groups contributing to the goals of the deal reached in Bonn to form a power - sharing government .
The EU , the biggest contributor , stressed that its offer of $ 1bn over five years was contingent on cost efficiency , a reference to the fear that cash could easily find its way into the wrong hands .
The caveats effectively confirmed Mr Karzai as Afghanistan 's billion - dollar man .
The message was that without him and the political process he is leading Afghanistan could lose the goodwill and money it has accumulated .
Mr Karzai pushed all the right buttons to win support from rich states and aid organisations at the conference : women 's rights , private sector enterprise , transparency , multi - ethnic democracies , and destruction of the drug trade .
At times his determination to say what his hosts wanted to hear was painfully apparent .
Talking to Japanese journalists yesterday , he promised to be a "" samurai against corruption "" and said his two dreams were to liberalise Afghanistan and climb Mount Fuji .
This charm has worked wonders in opening donors ' purses .
The final tally of pledges was $ 1.8bn for this year , with another $ 2.7bn over the next four years - better than expected before the conference began and roughly in line with an assessment of Afghanistan 's needs by the World Bank and UN .
The United States said the political and economic process of rebuilding that took the Afghan leader to Tokyo could become a model for future fronts in the war on terrorism .
Meanwhile , US aid officials said the international support would work as a weapon against Mr Karzai 's enemies .
But the dangers of staking too much on one individual were apparent when the vehicle taking Mr Karzai to the airport after the conference was involved in a accident on the motorway .
Although his car ended up wedged between two security vehicles in a minor five - car pile - up , Afghan 's new leader was unhurt - no doubt much to the relief of the world 's cheque - writers ."
2002-01-24,"At the end of this week 's Afghanistan reconstruction conference in Tokyo , Hamid Karzai , the head of the country 's interim administration , may have flown off with the cash , but it was the chairwoman , Sadako Ogata , who walked away with the plaudits .
And while Mr Karzai still has a lot to do to prove that he deserves the $ 4.5bn ( £ 3.15bn ) that was pledged , few would doubt that Ms Ogata is worthy of the praise that has been heaped upon her over the past few days .
At times , the adulation for the former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees appeared to move beyond the professional realm .
"" I 'm a devotee , "" said James Wolfensohn , the president of the World Bank .
"" I think she is the best international official I 've ever met . ""
While extreme , such compliments do not seem to be entirely undeserved .
Displaying leadership , charm and fluent English - qualities rarely associated with Japanese figures on the world stage -
Ms Ogata helped to push the conference to a result that exceeded most expectations .
That success was apparent both in the feelgood atmospherics of the event and in the pledges of 25 donor nations : $ 1.8bn in aid this year , and another $ 2.7bn over the following four years .
This is already in line with a needs assessment by the UN and World Bank - and the figure is expected to grow because the United States is only able to make a one - year commitment even though it has gone as far as possible within constitutional restraints to suggest that it will continue to pay $ 300 m annually towards Afghan 's reconstruction .
Important questions remain about how soon the money will arrive , how it will be spent and what will happen to the donors ' enthusiasm when the international spotlight has moved elsewhere - but this detracts little from the Tokyo conference , which achieved them with an impressive display of no - nonsense realism and unflagging commitment .
In closing comments , she asked that her approach be adopted by others with regard to Afghanistan . ""
With time and persistence , things move .
This is my philosophy .
Let 's be patient . ""
Much to the disappointment of the domestic media , Japan 's international star is reportedly planning to return to her home in New York .
The mass - circulation Yomiuri Shimbun has wasted no time in trying to persuade her to remain so that she can replace the fiery Makiko Tanaka - who was largely bypassed during the conference - as foreign minister .
But this seems to miss the point .
While it is true that Ms Tanaka - Japan 's first female foreign minister - seems ineffective by comparison with Ms Ogata , the same is even more true of the countless male holders of the post who have come and gone on the international stage without making any noticeable impact .
If Ms Ogata 's impressive performance last week - and before during her term as chief of the UNHCR - shows anything , it is that Japanese women , who tend to be far more cosmopolitan and linguistically skilled than Japanese men , are better suited to represent the country in this globalised age ."
2002-01-26,"The highly delicate project of instaling a broad - based and representative government in Afghanistan moved a step forward yesterday with the naming of a commission to select the country 's decision makers .
The 21 people announced by the interim leader , Hamid Karzai , are charged with summoning a loya jirga , or grand council of tribal elders , who in turn will decide on the transitional government to rule Afghanistan for 18 months from next June .
Their choices will be intensely scrutinised as the commission seeks to balance competing ethnic , clan and regional interests against an unfamiliar imperative for Afghanistan : representation for women .
However , only two of the commission 's representatives are women - a statistic that will cause dismay among activists and western observers , but is already more than some traditional Afghan leaders can stomach .
For weeks , United Nations officials had sifted the list , seeking to balance rival factions , and to ensure the appearance of independence for the commission .
They completed their monumental task of whittling down a list of nearly 400 potential candidates to 21 a week ago , but UN officials said the announcement was timed to coincide with the visit to Kabul yesterday of the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan .
"" I know not everybody will be entirely happy with the list , but it is a good list , "" Mr Annan said .
"" Let 's support them and work with them . ""
The work of the commission is crucial in ensuring that the loya jirga is seen by ordinary Afghans , as well as by warlords and tribal leaders , as legitimate .
Its announcement is also expected to sharpen the rivalries between various Afghan groups , who have so far held back from directly challenging Mr Karzai , as they see his six - month administration as a passing phase .
However , the 18-month transitional government offers far greater takings , and different Afghan factions have begun to compete for a place on the loya jirga .
Mr Karzai - who is expected to seek a seat in the new government - seemed acutely aware of this as he read out the list of 21 names .
He emphasised that the list was drawn up by the UN , and said he knew only four of the appointees .
"" This shows this is a really nice commission , a real impartial commission
and I hope that they , together with the UN , will be successful in their work and give Afghanistan a good , representative , fair loya jirga , "" he said .
The commission is headed by Ismael Qasimyar , an Afghan expert on law and the constitution .
One of his two deputies is a woman : Mahboba Hoqoqmal , a lecturer in political science .
Their mission is fraught as various Afghan factions vie for power .
A number of warlords have transformed themselves into politicians , and in Pakistan former Taliban leaders have formed a political party in the hope of taking part in the political process .
Afghanistan 's women 's rights activists have camped out in Kabul for weeks pressing their demand that the next government provide constitutional safeguards for equal rights .
UN officials admit that Mr Karzai 's government is heavily weighted in favour of ethnic Tajiks from the Panjshir valley , followers of the assassinated warrior , Ahmed Shah Massoud , who control the foreign , defence and interior ministries .
The transitional government , in sharp contrast , must give greater power to Pashtuns , who are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan ."
2002-01-28,"Afghan villagers last night claimed that American special forces had botched a raid north of Kandahar , killing at least 15 pro - government local leaders who were negotiating the surrender of local Taliban fighters .
US troops have now been accused of blundering in several ground assaults inside Afghanistan since the Taliban regime fell last month .
The new claims came as Hamid Karzai , the head of the interim government in Kabul , left for his first official visit to Washington .
The Pentagon said on Friday that the raid on Hazar Qadam , 60 miles north of Kandahar , destroyed a huge Taliban arms dump , killing about 15 people .
At least 27 "" relatively senior "" Taliban were captured and taken to an American military detention facility in Kandahar , it said .
Yet villagers yesterday insisted the US troops had been badly misled .
They said the victims of the attack at Hazar Qadam were headed by an ethnic - group leader called Haji Sana Gul , who had just disarmed a number of Taliban fighters still holding out in the area .
His brother Bari Gul said the men spent Wednesday night in the local madrassah , or religious seminary .
Before dawn the next day US troops swept in , killing several people in the madrassah , including Haji Sana Gul himself .
Two of the dead had their hands tied behind their backs , Bari Gul said .
Three more people were killed in a building a mile away .
Yusuf Pashtun , an aide to the Kandahar governor Gul Agha , said he too believed American commandos had struck the wrong targets .
"" It looks like it was raided by mistake , "" he said .
"" The people of the district centre are very much against the Taliban . ""
US military officials said an AC-130 flying gunship was used in the raid , strafing the compounds and destroying a large number of weapons on the ground .
Rear Admiral John Stufflebeem , the deputy director of operations for the US joint chiefs of staff , said on Friday that the village had been under surveillance before the attack.""We have been watching this facility for a while , "" he said .
Yesterday , a Kandahar - based US army spokesman said suggestions that pro - government forces had been wrongly attacked "" are not consistent with our intelligence "" .
American officials have acknowledged that they must frequently depend on information from members of rival ethnic groupings whose loyalties are frequently shifting .
On December 29 , American bombers killed at least 100 people in a village in eastern Afghanistan .
The Pentagon said Taliban and al - Qaida fighters were targeted .
Survivors said those killed had been civilians attending a wedding .
A week earlier , a convoy of 100 Afghans travelling near Khost , in the east , were bombed by US jets , and at least 60 died .
Again , the Pentagon said it believed the dead were Taliban and al - Qaida fighters , but survivors said they were elders going to Kabul to mark the new government 's inauguration ."
2002-01-28,"Afghanistan 's interim leader , Hamid Karzai , today used his visit to the United States to appeal to Afghan - Americans to return home and apply their skills to rebuilding the country .
Mr Karzai , the first Afghan leader to visit Washington in 39 years , was to meet with the US president , George Bush , at the White House to seek continued American help in restoring peace to Afghanistan .
Before his visit to the White House , he spoke to thousands of young Afghan - Americans jammed into a basketball arena at Washington 's Georgetown University .
"" You are the future of our country , "" Mr Karzai told them . ""
Study hard , work hard , make money and bring it to Afghanistan . ""
He indicated that Afghanistan must make good use of £ 3.2bn in aid pledged by donor nations last week in Tokyo .
"" Our responsibility is starting , "" he said .
Meanwhile , in a pre - dawn raid in Afghanistan , US special forces stormed a hospital in Kandahar holding al - Qaida gunmen who had threatened to kill anyone who tried to capture them .
The operation was reportedly over but there were no details yet of arrests or casualties .
Yesterday , a delegation of villagers trekked to Kandahar to complain to Afghan authorities that US army special forces killed innocent people in a night - time raid four days earlier .
The Pentagon said US troops attacked a Taliban arms depot north of Kandahar , killing about 15 people , capturing 27 others and destroying a large cache of weapons .
But the leaders from the remote town of Khas Uruzgan claimed US forces made a mistake , bombing their town hall and clinic , and killing and arresting men loyal to Mr Karzai .
Mr Karzai was expected to discuss military operations in his meetings with Mr Bush and congressional leaders , but it was not known whether he would raise the Special Forces attack .
Before leaving for the US , Mr Karzai said he would use the trip to push for the expansion of a multinational security force to the rest of Afghanistan .
Afghan officials believe troops are needed in the countryside to deal with regional warlords and armed gangs .
They have indicated they want American troops to participate .
The Bush administration has resisted US involvement in the 2,500-strong British - led security force protecting Mr Karzai 's interim administration in the Afghan capital , Kabul .
But Washington has said that US troops will probably remain in the country at least until the middle of the year , hunting al - Qaida and Taliban holdouts and helping stabilise the countryside .
The peacekeeping troops have begun distributing leaflets about their mission to Kabul residents to ease "" their fear and apprehension "" about foreign soldiers , said John Turner , a spokesman for the force .
The leaflets include pictures of the participating nations ' flags so Kabul residents can tell where troops are from .
In other developments , Marjan the lion , who was blinded by a grenade in the mid-1990s and came to symbolise Afghanistan 's suffering during 23 years of war , was to be buried today at Kabul 's zoo .
He was found dead of apparent old age in his cage on Saturday .
Mr Karzai 's government adopted Afghanistan 's royalist - era green - black - and - red flag as the country 's new flag .
The flag was used until King Mohammed Zaher Shah was deposed in 1973 .
The US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , ruled out any possibility of granting prisoner - of - war status to suspected al - Qaida and Taliban terrorists held in a makeshift prison at the US Navy base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Under the Geneva conventions , a POW has certain rights that would govern interrogations and require they be released when the Afghanistan hostilities end ."
2002-01-29,"George Bush welcomed the interim prime minister of Afghanistan to the White House yesterday and announced that the United States is to train the Afghan police and military .
Hamid Karzai responded by pledging to bring the remaining al - Qaida fighters "" out of their caves and their hide - outs "" .
The president used a joint press conference to announce an extension of $ 50 m ( £ 36 m ) in credit facilities to Afghanistan and to say that "" these efforts are only the beginning "" .
He added : "" The United States is committed to building a lasting partnership with the new Afghanistan . ""
Mr Karzai responded by thanking the US for its help against the Soviet Union and the Taliban , and to say that the hunt for Osama bin Laden continues : "" We are looking for him .
He is a fugitive . ""
In a symbolic ceremony in Washington earlier , Mr Karzai had unfurled the red , black and green Afghan flag outside his country 's embassy , which has been closed for five years .
"" Let 's hope that this flag will be there forever , and that the partnership between the American and Afghan people will be forever , "" he said .
Later , in a television interview , Mr Karzai stressed that he wanted UN peacekeeping forces to play a major role in all areas of Afghanistan . ""
The people I 've met over the past month ... almost all of them have asked me to ask the international security forces to go to the other parts of the country . ""
If the United States can be there as part of that multinational force , it 's welcome , "" he said .
But the White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said : "" The president 's philosophy is that the United States should not be overly deployed in peacekeeping around the world .
The purpose of the troops should be to fight wars . ""
President Bush has welcomed many world leaders to the White House since September 11 but none carries a greater significance than the man chosen as the leader of Afghanistan 's interim administration .
Mr Karzai was believed to have requested more financial and material help from the US to help restructure Afghanistan 's economy .
The US had already pledged $ 300 m in aid .
On Sunday , Mr Karzai addressed an audience of hundreds of mainly exile Afghan Americans at Georgetown university in Washington . ""
Come back to your country and we will welcome you , "" Mr Karzai said to loud applause .
"" It 's all right , whatever passport you have you can come back to Afghanistan .
You can come back here .
You can do both . ""
He said that dual citizenship would be offered to those prepared to contribute their skills , advice or money to rebuilding the country .
Speaking in both Pashtu and Dari , Mr Karzai said : "" Without your cooperation , we 're not going to make it . ""
He told younger members of the audience : "" You are the future of our country .
Study hard , work hard , make money and bring it to Afghanistan . ""
Asked during a question - and - answer session whether he favoured the punishment under Islamic law of cutting off the hands of thieves , Mr Karzai said that while the country was poverty - stricken he did not approve of the law ."
2002-01-29,"In what could be seen as a concession to international opinion , President Bush said yesterday that he is now discussing what legal provisions of the Geneva Convention may apply to the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay .
But Mr Bush reiterated that his administration has no intention of changing the status of the 158 detainees and treating them as prisoners of war . ""
These are killers , "" said Mr Bush during a joint press conference with the Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai .
"" We are not going to call them prisoners of war . ""
Mr Bush did refer to the men as "" prisoners "" but then corrected himself and called them "" detainees "" .
The president spelled out the administration 's reasons for the distinction by saying that "" the reason why is al - Qaida is not a known military "" .
"" These are killers , "" Mr Bush said .
"" These are terrorists .
They know no countries .
The only thing they know about country is when they find a country that 's been weakened and they want to occupy it like a parasite . ""
However , Mr Bush said he had been having discussions with his national security advisers as to what legal status the men will have .
When a decision had been made on this , he said , he would make a statement .
The president said he would listen to "" all the legalisms , and announce my decision when I make it "" .
The White House was at pains yesterday to try to defuse the suggestion of a row between the secretary of state , Colin Powell , and other members of the administration over the treatment of the men at Camp X - Ray .
The difference of opinion emerged over the weekend with reports that Mr Powell believed that the detainees should be regarded as prisoners of war , at least until they had appeared in front of a hearing .
The defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , has grown increasingly tetchy when questioned about the status of the men .
He has said that both al - Qaida and Taliban prisoners were "" unlawful combatants "" and therefore did not qualify as prisoners of war .
If they were accepted as prisoners of war , the men would only have to give their name , rank and number and could not be interrogated .
The US position is that it is vital to question the men as they may have knowledge of planned terrorist attacks on the US or elsewhere in the world .
Victoria Clarke , the chief spokeswoman for Mr Rumsfeld , said yesterday that the prisoners were being treated humanely .
"" We are in very unconventional times , "" she said .
"" We 're in a very unconventional war .
So every aspect of it , including the Geneva Convention and how it might be applied should be looked at with new eyes . ""
The White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said yesterday that , even if the men were Taliban fighters rather than al - Qaida , they would not qualify for PoW status because the Taliban were only recognised as a legitimate Afghan government by a few countries .
He said that the detainees were being treated well and humanely "" because that is what Americans do "" .
The administration 's position has been that the photograph released last week by the Pentagon showing the men in the camp kneeling and blindfolded gave a misleading impression and that the men were being moved at the time and were not kept blindfolded at all times or forced to kneel ."
2002-01-31,"The Conservative leader , Iain Duncan Smith , today launched a scathing attack on Tony Blair 's "" unrealistic and deluded designer diplomacy "" .
Warning against "" foreign entanglements "" which leave British forces overstretched and vulnerable , Mr Duncan Smith accused the prime minister of having a "" utopian "" willingness to commit UK troops abroad .
Mr Blair later condemned the opposition leader 's remarks as inappropriate on the day that Afghanistan interim leader Hamid Karzai was visiting London and accused him of "" wrong and misguided "" isolationism .
In his speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs , Mr Duncan Smith said : "" So much of today 's designer diplomacy demonstrates a worrying lack of realism .
What is at work is a delusion about the way the world actually works . ""
He added : "" Countries which seek to pursue ambitious foreign policies which neither advance their interests nor match their resources are putting their standing and possibly their security at risk . ""
And there is worse .
An unfocused approach to foreign policy leads to , and is often devised in pursuit of , media grandstanding . ""
The Tory leader said he supported the prime minister "" whenever the national interest demands "" and applauded him for strengthening the bond between Britain and the US . ""
At an emotional level the transatlantic relationship has rarely been closer , "" he said .
But Mr Duncan Smith described the premier as a "" utopian internationalist "" who only had to "" glance at an opportunity for multilateral intervention in order to jump at it "" . ""
The prime minister seems to believe that there are no limits to what Britain , acting as part of an all - embracing global coalition of the righteous , can and should do to make the world a better place .
"" Were it not now politically incorrect to do so , he would probably term foreign policy a crusade . ""
Mr Blair , who has been criticised for ignoring the domestic agenda by undertaking a series of foreign "" coalition - building "" post - September 11 trips , said he was "" astonished "" at Mr Duncan Smith 's remarks .
Speaking at a Downing Street news conference with Afghanistan interim leader Hamid Karzai , he said : "" I think since September 11 it has become absolutely obvious to everybody that events in one part of the world can dramatically affect events in another part of the world . ""
I think it 's not just right but essential that Britain plays its role on the international stage , not just for the purpose of bringing about a better and more stable international community but also because the fact that Afghanistan was a failed state living on terrorism and drugs affected Britain . ""
He added : "" This idea that somehow we isolate ourselves from the rest of the world , we draw in upon ourselves , that Britain becomes a sort of reclusive figure trying to shield ourselves from what happens on the international stage - that is so wrong and misguided . ""
Not merely do I have no hesitation , I have pride in saying Britain has been a force for good since the 11th of September .
"" I think on a day when Hamid Karzai is here telling us about what is happening in the reconstruction of Afghanistan , I ca n't think of a day that is less appropriate to make those types of remarks , frankly . """
2002-01-31,"The prime minister , Tony Blair , today said that Britain had a "" complete and continuing commitment "" to Afghanistan , but made no mention of expanding Britain 's role in the international peacekeeping force .
Hamid Karzai , the country 's interim leader , said an extension of the force was a "" demand of the Afghan people "" at a joint Downing Street press conference with the prime minister , adding that Britain could be proud of its contribution at the head of the troops .
"" The Afghan people are really asking for these forces as a symbol of the commitment of the international community , "" he said .
Mr Blair did not promise to extend Britain 's contribution in terms of troops - which now stands at 5,000 soldiers - but said he believed that the international community had a long - term commitment to the force .
His spokesman said that any decision to expand its role was a matter for the interim government and all countries with soldiers involved .
The two men - who met previously at Bagram airbase near Kabul - also discussed the drugs trade and tourism .
Mr Karzai thanked Britain for its role in the US - led war against Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaida network and the Taliban .
"" Afghanistan could not have been freed from the occupation of terrorism , from the presence of terrorism , without the help of the friends that we have , without the presence of your troops there , without the sacrifice they made , and without the contribution you made , "" he said .
Mr Blair said the last remaining members of the Taliban and Bin Laden must still be found , but spoke of the humanitarian work and reconstruction needed in the country .
Mr Karzai flew into London this morning and was met at Heathrow airport by the foreign secretary , Jack Straw .
The two men headed to Downing Street , where the Afghan leader joined ministers for the end of their weekly cabinet meeting - one of few foreign leaders to have done so .
He thanked ministers for their contributions to reconstructing his nation , still devastated after three decades of war .
Britain has pledged to spend £ 200 m over the next five years .
"" We will make sure that the money that your taxpayers have given to our government is spent respectfully and correctly , "" Mr Karzai said .
He again outlined his spending priorities - education , health , road building , communications and banking .
He said the Taliban had run away with whatever money they could get their hands on .
"" We literally had no currency notes .
Our own notes , which are printed in trillions , "" he laughed .
As well as financial aid , Britain may agree to provide support in the future in the form of a military training team to help build up a regular Afghan army .
Mr Karzai had caught an overnight flight from Washington , where he had been offered US military expertise in training Afghan troops by the US president , George Bush .
Mr Bush also extended $ 50 m ( £ 35 m ) in credit facilities to Afghanistan .
While in the US , Mr Karzai reopened his country 's Washington embassy , which has been closed for the last five years , and attended Mr Bush 's state of the union address on Tuesday night .
However , Mr Bush ruled out the possibility of US troops joining the small international peacekeeping mission in the country , despite repeated invitations from Mr Karzai .
The White House spokesman , Ari Fleischer , said : "" The president 's philosophy is that the United States should not be overly deployed in peacekeeping around the world .
The purpose of the troops should be to fight wars . ""
Mr Karzai also addressed the UN security council yesterday , asking for an expanded international presence to keep growing lawlessness in check and to provide the stability needed for reconstruction ."
2002-02-01,"Tony Blair yesterday welcomed Afghanistan 's interim leader , Hamid Karzai , to a meeting of his cabinet and offered him all possible help with the reconstruction of his war - torn country - short of providing extra British troops on the ground .
Though notably calm and self - assured throughout a hectic day of engagements , Mr Karzai made repeated appeals for the expansion of the international force now based in the capital , Kabul .
He made the plea when he spoke to the cabinet - a rare honour usually accorded only to US presidents - and in media interviews later in the day .
The urgency of his call was underlined by news that troops loyal to the new administration in Kabul were fighting forces loyal to the local council , or shura , for control of Gardez in the south - east .
In the worst factional fighting since the interim government took power five weeks ago , at least 43 people were killed and dozens wounded , members of the two sides and hospital officials said .
Mr Karzai told his hosts that international troops were needed in cities beyond the capital .
Tribal leaders were daily asking him to bring foreign forces into their regions .
At his side the prime minister was sympathetic but guarded .
"" There is a limit to what we can do , "" Mr Blair said .
Senior British military officials later made it clear that any decision was a long way off - and that a new force would not include British soldiers .
"" I think we will find that the long - term commitment for the international community is there , "" Mr Blair said .
Both men stressed the effects of the crisis on the rest of the world .
Mr Blair told reporters that a "" failed state "" was producing 70 % of the heroin sold on Britain 's streets .
Mr Karzai promisd to do his best to end poppy production .
The Afghan leader , now officially described as Chairman Karzai , was given the red - carpet treatment from the moment he arrived at Heathrow , speaking to Jack Straw before the foreign secretary flew to Washington to see the secretary of state , Colin Powell , lunching at Downing Street , meeting MPs and attending a dinner hosted by the defence secretary , Geoff Hoon .
The weekly meeting of the cabinet stood up to greet their guest and applauded him warmly when he finished his remarks .
He spoke in what was described as "" a very impressive way , without notes "" .
A few ministers gave a sharp intake of breath as the Afghan leader told them that the fleeing Taliban had taken all his country 's money with them - down to the last banknote .
Mr Karzai said his priorities were education , health and transport ( Mr Blair 's domestic agenda too ) , as well as the reconstruction of a banking and currency system and a proper police force and army , to be trained by the US .
Mr Karzai praised Mr Blair in particular for risking a symbolic night flight into Bagram airport at a time when there were still "" terrorists in the mountains "" .
He told Mr Blair : "" That showed your courage . ""
Soft - spoken and deploying fluent English learned at an English - style school in Simla , India , Mr Karzai was also generous in his praise of the US , British and Europeans for helping to rid Afghanistan of what he called "" a horrible force that knew nothing but to torture , kill and destroy lives "" .

2002-02-01,"The Australian government yesterday underlined its determination to stop migrants seeking asylum in the country , when it unveiled a plan to pay Afghan refugees to return to their homeland .
John Howard , the prime minister , announced the repatriation scheme after a meeting in New York with Afghanistan 's interim leader , Hamid Karzai , at which Mr Howard stressed he would not soften his policy of detaining all unauthorised arrivals .
Mr Howard agreed to allow a special delegation sent by Mr Karzai to inspect Australia 's controversial Woomera detention centre and talk to Afghan refugees who recently went on a two - week hunger strike and threatened to kill themselves .
The government said financial aid would be offered to some 1,100 Afghan refugees in Australia and on Nauru and Papua New Guinea , to where the government has forcibly redirected boatloads of refugees since last August .
These include more than 300 migrants on Nauru who were rescued by a Norwegian freighter , Tampa , which Mr Howard prevented from landing on the mainland five months ago .
The scheme would also be available to the 3,000 Afghan refugees who have been given three - year temporary visas . ""
Now that the Taliban is no longer there , the public reason that most of them have given for leaving Afghanistan is no longer there , "" Mr Howard said .
"" I do n't think it is unreasonable of us to expect them to go back to Afghanistan . ""
Refugees could receive their air fare back to Afghanistan and a cash payment , similar to the government 's repatriation scheme for Kosovans after the 1999 conflict , who were offered A$ 3,000 ( £ 1,080 ) per adult to help them to resettle .
Senator Bob Brown , of the Green party , said the government 's offer of money was an attempt "" to buy itself out of a very inhumane policy "" .
Refugees and migration experts predicted that few Afghans would accept the cash offer .
One former Woomera detainee said : "" Asylum seekers did n't come to Australia looking for money .
They came looking for freedom . ""
Many refugees are ethnic Hazaras , and still fear persecution in Afghanistan , according to one migration agent .
The detention system is under fire from both inside and outside the country 's six secure centres , despite the refugees in Woomera ending a two - week hunger strike on Wednesday .
More than 100 migrants are now on hunger strike at the Curtin detention centre , Western Australia , in protest at visa delays and an alleged sexual assault on a boy at the camp .
More than 1,000 lawyers and law students are placing an advert in tomorrow 's Australian newspaper , opposing the government 's mandatory detention of refugees ."
2002-02-08,"The hunt for Osama Bin Laden and his al - Qaida supporters in Afghanistan will continue until they have all been driven from the country , the Afghan interim leader , Hamid Karzai , said today .
"" The war against terrorism is not over , "" Mr Karzai told journalists at a joint press conference with Pakistan 's president , General Pervez Musharraf , in Islamabad .
"" We will have to go look for them in their hide - outs , in their caves , wherever they are ...
The fight against terrorism will go to the very end of it . ""
In a show of solidarity with Afghanistan 's new government , Gen Musharraf offered Afghanistan $ 10 m to help with reconstruction after decades of war .
He said that peace and stability in the neighbouring country were vital for the economic and strategic interests of south Asia . ""
Pakistan is extremely interested in a stable , peaceful , united and stable Afghanistan as a brotherly neighbour , "" Mr Musharraf said .
"" It not only serves the purpose of peace in the region but also the economic interest of the region . ""
Mr Karzai was in Pakistan for a two - day visit , designed to strengthen ties between the two countries .
Pakistan was the strongest supporter of the former Taliban regime until Mr Musharraf agreed to side with America in its war in Afghanistan .
However , thousands of Pakistanis joined Taliban fighters in their struggle against the northern alliance .
Pakistan 's religious parties strongly opposed Musharraf 's decision to ditch his support of the Taliban .
Both he and Mr Karzai sought to paper over past divisions .
"" Afghanistan and Pakistan are bound together by common geography , linked by rivers and mountains , bounds of faith , history and culture .
The two countries can not avoid close relations , "" the Pakistani leader said ."
2002-02-15,"During a meeting today in Kabul with the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , Afghanistan 's interim president , Hamid Karzai , repeated his call for more international troops to protect his country , following the violent death of his tourism minister at the city 's airport .
Mr Karzai said the killing of the minister , Abdul Rahman , took place in mysterious circumstances and could have been carried out by al - Qaida terrorists still operating in Afghanistan .
Mr Straw 's RAF Hercules landed at Kabul international airport just a few hours after Dr Rahman was killed en route to Hajj in Saudi Arabia .
Afghan foreign ministry officials said a mob of around 900 pilgrims , angry after a two - day delay and a long wait in a freezing cold terminal , had gathered at the airport .
The foreign secretary 's plane today remained on the military side of the airport , but the chartered aircraft from which Mr Rahman was dragged was within the civilian sector .
The incident raised serious questions about the effectiveness of the 4,000-member UK - led international security assistance force in Kabul .
Mr Karzai emerged from talks with Mr Straw at the presidential palace in Kabul and told reporters that Mr Rahman 's murder was a "" tragic , tragic event "" .
He called an emergency cabinet meeting last night and set up a commission of four ministers to investigate the incident .
Mr Karzai said he wanted London and Washington to commit to more ISAF troops to prevent incidents like that happening .
Mr Karzai said : "" We will find out who did this .
As we all know , we still have a prevalence of terrorism in Afghanistan , they can come in any form .
"" That is what I kept repeating , when I was in the UK and Washington , I kept asking that my people say we need more of the security assistance force .
The incident last night proves our point . ""
Mr Straw admitted that the Dr Rahman 's brutal murder did raise serious questions , but he did not promise more troops .
"" There is an issue of security in Afghanistan , everybody knows that - that is why we have been playing such an important central role , "" he said .
The international community wanted to see a fully national Afghan army and a national police service trained up as soon as possible , Mr Straw said .
There would be "" intensive discussions "" about what , where and how ISAF was expanded after Britain finishes its lead nation role in April . ""
I recognise the strong case chairman Karzai makes for that [ expansion ] but we have to make sure if we are going to put troops elsewhere
we do so in secure , safe conditions where everybody understands their role ,
"" Mr Straw said .
"" What we have to recognise is the huge relative progress that is being made in the country between the fall of Kabul in early November and the establishment in December of the interim authority .
"" There is a degree of security and safety unknown to people for many years before .
This shows that , yes , there is a huge way to go in this country but , by God , let us celebrate what has been achieved in three months , "" he said .
Earlier , the foreign secretary met with his Afghan counterpart , Abdullah Abdullah , to discuss ISAF .
They discussed the possibility of Turkey , the only Muslim member of Nato , taking over the lead of ISAF when Britain steps down ."
2002-02-18,"Britain has sent four Hercules aircraft to Kabul to help airlift hundreds of Afghans to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage .
The move is in response to a plea from Afghanistan 's interim leader , Hamid Karzai , after about 8,000 Muslim pilgrims were stranded in freezing temperatures at Kabul airport and the city 's main mosque for days waiting for flights to the holy city of Mecca .
An Afghan aviation authority official said that Saudi Arabia had also sent a Boeing 747 and Pakistan an Airbus A310 to help transport the frustrated pilgrims .
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said four C-130 Hercules aircraft were transporting about 500 pilgrims .
"" There is an immediate short - term need so we 've decided to do this quick fix to relieve some of the pressure , "" he said .
The Hajj pilgrims , from all over Afghanistan , paid $ 1,500 ( £ 1,050 ) each for tickets to fly to Mecca , a small fortune for ordinary Afghans .
But many of the promised flights failed to materialise , leading to scenes of chaos at the airport .
Yesterday , a crowd surged towards the heavily guarded departure terminal and shattered a huge window .
Mr Karzai said he was trying to ensure that all the pilgrims would be able to make the journey . ""
In the past two days I have done nothing but Hajj , the whole government has stopped to work on the Hajj , so everybody 's working on the Hajj to make sure the whole thing takes place , "" he said .
He added that Saudi Arabia had agreed to extend yesterday 's deadline to allow the pilgrims to reach Mecca ."
2002-02-19,"A spate of violent incidents has dramatised the intense security problems facing the interim Afghan administration .
Last week , a senior minister serving in Hamid Karzai 's coalition was murdered at Kabul airport , the apparent victim of factional rivalries .
Further north , around Mazar - i - Sharif , as well as in the Iranian border regions to the west , sporadic internecine clashes continue unchecked .
When not fighting among themselves , hostile Afghan elements turn on outsiders .
A US military base near Kandahar came under assault from infiltrators last week .
In the capital British paratroopers , believing themselves to be under attack , allegedly fired on a car carrying civilians , with tragic consequences .
Unicef meanwhile reported yesterday that "" the security of all UN workers and officials remains of utmost concern "" after the weekend killing of an aid worker , the wounding of another , and a suspected kidnapping .
Political violence and tribal feuding apart , anecdotal evidence points in any case to a rising incidence of banditry and common criminality .
Amid all this uncertainty and strife , on - off American bombing raids and ground operations persist in the forlorn hope of snaring , even now , the many senior al - Qaida and Taliban leaders who escaped the Pentagon 's dragnet .
Such officially sanctioned violence , while too frequently victimising civilian innocents , delays efforts to turn the page on two decades of warfare and start afresh .
The longer the Karzai administration fails to take charge and impose order , and the longer Afghanistan remains the US military 's biggest , best shooting range and hunting ground , the smaller the chances that the Bonn process can succeed .
Nobody could reasonably have expected an Afghan restoration to be either quick or problem - free .
But current trends point to two conclusions .
One is that Mr Karzai is right to ask the US to send its troops to join Britain in an expanded stabilisation force and that President George Bush is woefully wrong to refuse him .
The second is that if security continues to deteriorate , Mr Karzai will ineluctably lose credibility , then control .
His downfall will trigger the collapse of most if not all the grand international rehabilitation schemes .
With the returning , resurgent warlords , proxy forces and opium barons will come fanatics , ideologues and terrorists .
And then , for want of staying power and a bit of nous , it really could be back to square one ."
2002-02-20,"The US is widening the war in Afghanistan , bombing tribal groups opposed to the central government as well as remnants of al - Qaida and Taliban fighters .
American aircraft have attacked groups engaged in skirmishes with forces loyal to the Hamid Karzai 's government , near the southeastern city of Khost .
The weekend bombing was believed to be the first time that American air power had been used to defend the Karzai administration against opposition groups .
Until then US forces , in the air and on the ground , had concentrated on searching for and attacking what was left of al - Qaida and Taliban fighters .
Though no details of the attacks have emerged , they have been confirmed by the US central command and by Pakistani officials close to the border with Afghanistan .
According to the central command statement , "" pro - government forces "" requested the raids after "" enemy troops "" fired on them as they tried to pass a roadblock .
The statement gave no details of the identity of either force .
Abdul Wali Zadran , brother of Padsha Khan Zadran , a warlord in the region , said the clashes involved two tribal militias , one from the Kochi clan and the other from the Gorboz clan , about 20 miles east of Khost .
Both profess loyalty to Mr Karzai .
Faced with fighting between warlords and tribal leaders in northern as well as eastern Afghanistan over the past few weeks , Mr Karzai made it clear he would ask for US help in quashing his opponents .
He is also increasingly concerned about instability in the country outside Kabul , according to western officials .
The assassination last week of his aviation minister , Abdul Rahman , at Kabul airport suggests he can not rely on the loyalty of all the factions which make up his administration .
The Afghan government yesterday appointed two ministers to investigate Mr Rahman 's killing .
Suspects include senior members of a Northern Alliance faction with close links to the nascent Afghan police force .
Mr Karzai has demanded the extradition from Saudi Arabia of three senior officials in connection with Mr Rahman 's killing .
They are General Abdullah Jan Tawhidi , the deputy intelligence chief , General Kalandar Beg , a senior official in the defence ministry , and a justice ministry official identified only as Halim .
Mr Karzai said : "" I will ask for every measure to bring security to the Afghan people .
I will use international forces , Afghan forces , to make life good for these people .
There is no way we will let Afghanistan go the way of the past . ""
What appears to be a new phase in the America bombing campaign comes at time when Mr Karzai is pressing the Europeans to increase the size and extend the deployment of the British - led international security assistance force .
It also coincides with talks between US military officers and the Karzai administration on training an Afghan army .
American officials said the US would train about 600 Afghans , who would then train others .
Greek troops arrived in Afghanistan yesterday for the first time since the armies of Alexander the Great 2,300 years ago , their commander , Manolas Christos , said .
The 50 troops will join the Isaf force .
· Two British paratroopers last night flew to Britain from Kabul to be questioned about their firing on a vehicle carrying a pregnant Afghan woman to hospital , the Ministry of Defence said .
The soldiers , of the second battalion , the Parachute Regiment will be interviewed at their barracks in Colchester by the royal military police .
Afghan police are also looking into the incident ."

2002-03-28,"Afghans dug with their hands through the rubble of the flattened town of Nahrin yesterday in the hope of finding some survivors of the series of earthquakes that officials say killed well over 2,000 people .
More tremors shook the brown moonscape earth under the feet of interim leader Hamid Karzai , who told dozens of survivors who crowded near him in the devastated northern market town in the foothills of the Hindu Kush that everything possible was being done to help victims of the quake .
A weeping woman rushed up to kiss the hand of Afghanistan 's new leader as he said : "" Our hearts are with you .
Everything will be done . ""
During Mr Karzai 's visit , which lasted several hours , three significant tremors rocked the area , causing his party to cluster nervously round him .
Smaller tremors were felt every 10 to 15 minutes .
Homeless people sat on carpets - for some their only surviving possession - as clouds of dust were kicked up around them by each fresh tremor .
During one , a young girl stood transfixed with terror as the earth seemed to ripple around her feet .
A Pakistani seismic centre said one tremor yesterday had measured 5.2 on the Richter scale , powerful enough to cause heavy damage in a populated area and of a similar magnitude to those which struck Nahrin on Monday and Tuesday .
Villages around Nahrin , a district capital which had a population of 10,000 , were also hit , but there was little information on how many people had died there because blocked roads made it virtually impossible to reach them .
In Nahrin , a town of mud - brick buildings that not long ago was on the frontline of battles between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance , people clawed at the debris with their hands in the desperate hope of finding more survivors .
All they had found , as the first group of journalists reached the town , were corpses .
Mr Karzai has declared today a day of national mourning , as officials said the projected death toll had risen sharply from the 2,000 estimated on Tuesday , after fresh aftershocks . ""
Casualties have mounted dramatically after new aftershocks early this morning , "" a defence ministry spokesman , Gulbuddin , said .
"" We think the death toll is now far more than 2,000 and is going to go up dramatically as we dig through rubble in Nahrin and reach outlying villages . ""
However , the UN regional coordinator for northern Afghanistan said that fewer than 800 people were known to have died so far , and that 300 people were injured .
"" What we are aware of is that under 800 people have been buried while we have 300 wounded , "" Farhana Faruqi said .
Local people gulped bottled water to ease the thirst after 36 hours of breathing in dust since the first earthquake struck .
As journalists drove through the rubble - strewn streets they were applauded almost as liberators of a town that just several months earlier had seen bitter fighting between the Taliban and American - led forces .
Nahrin district , through which Alexander the Great passed in his conquest of the Hindu Kush region , had a population of about 80,000 .
The survivors said they had never experienced anything like this . ""
In all my life and in the memories of my father and his sisters there has never been an earthquake like this .
It was a killer , "" said 62-year - old Mauhaldin , who was born in Nahrin and has never travelled outside its immediate surroundings .
For victims like Mauhaldin , all they could recover when their mud houses collapsed were a carpet here , a pot there , a pair of sandals .
The houses in which they lived had mud walls up to half a metre thick , and roofs of the same material and thickness slapped on tree trunks as beams .
The weight tumbling down on occupants would have been more than that of a western suburban home .
Nahrin - famed for its wrestlers and some of the toughest players of buzkhasi , Afghanistan 's wild game played on horseback with a headless goat - was very close to the quake epicentres .
This is mainly farming land and there is a stark contrast between the hundreds of fallen brown buildings in the town and the signs of spring around it , where almond , peach and other fruit trees are starting to bloom .
A river just outside Nahrin is flowing quickly as snows melt in the Hindu Kush .
Its surface is flecked with dust now , the same dust that cloaks the town like a shroud .

2002-04-03,"Pakistan 's military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , finally drew a line under his country 's embarrassing support for the Taliban yesterday by flying to Kabul for the first time to give his personal backing to Afghanistan 's interim leader , Hamid Karzai .
Gen Musharraf said he "" made it absolutely clear "" during talks with Mr Karzai that Pakistan had only one aim - "" to assist Afghanistan "" .
"" Our plan is his plan , "" he said , describing Mr Karzai as "" my brother "" .
There was no reason why Pakistan and Afghanistan could not resolve their differences , he added , although he conceded that brothers sometimes disagreed .
Many members of Afghanistan 's new administration view Pakistan with a mistrust verging on hatred .
Gen Musharraf expediently dumped the Taliban last year in the wake of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington , but few Afghan officials have forgiven Pakistan for its longstanding military and diplomatic support for the ousted regime .
Gen Musharraf 's visit to Afghanistan goes some way towards normalising relations between the two neighbours .
Mr Karzai said yesterday he would consider releasing hundreds of Pakistani Taliban volunteers captured last year and now in Afghan jails .
The two sides also agreed to cooperate on counter - terrorism and wiping out opium production .
Pakistan and Afghanistan have several problems in common : a flourishing drugs trade ; a long mountainous border which is almost impossible to patrol ; and the continued threat of Islamist extremism .
Both countries have also come to rely on the United States for economic and political help .
Gen Musharraf arrived in Kabul yesterday from Islamabad amid tight security .
Kabul airport was cordoned off and traffic stopped a mile away .
US troops in Humvees mounted with machine guns drove in front of and behind Gen Musharraf 's motorcade as he headed for the presidential palace and his meeting with Mr Karzai .
Gen Musharraf later confirmed that Pakistan had handed over to the Americans a man believed to be Abu Zubaydah , one of Osama bin Laden 's key aides .
Although he was cautious , saying "" We are not 100 % certain [ it is him ] ""
, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said : "" We believe that one of the individuals captured by Pakistani authorities in recent days is Abu Zubaydah who , as you know , is a key terrorist recruiter and operational planner and member of Osama bin Laden 's inner circle . ""
Gen Musharraf also repeated his belief , first expressed in January , that Osama bin Laden was dead . ""
He may be dead or alive , I do n't know , "" he said .
"" But if you ask my view , maybe he is dead . ""
The Pakistani president 's trip to Kabul is also an attempt to prevent Afghanistan from falling under the influence of its arch - enemy , India .
Pakistani officials have watched with growing horror the stream of Indian diplomats pouring into Kabul since the Taliban 's fall .
Mr Karzai , who until recently lived in Pakistan , yesterday described the country as a "" good neighbour "" .
Neither leader alluded to the fact that most of the Taliban 's senior ministers are believed to be hiding out in Pakistan 's lawless tribal regions .
But Gen Musharraf expressed the hope that the two million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan would soon return home .
"" I would like to urge the international community to speed up the reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in Afghanistan because that is what will bring real normalcy here , "" Gen Musharraf said .
"" That is what will bring the refugees in Iran and Pakistan back to their homes . ""
Gen Musharraf 's visit to Afghanistan is the first by a Pakistani head of government since the prime minister he deposed in a coup , Nawaz Sharif , visited in the early 1990s .
Pakistan 's last military dictator , Zia ul - Haq , also visited in the late 1970s , before the Soviet invasion .
· Pakistani police have arrested at least 16 Arabs , Afghans and Pakistanis in Lahore in the latest in a series of raids on suspected al - Qaida hideouts , a senior official said yesterday .
The suspects gave up without serious resistance during the operation on Monday night , local police chief , Javed Noor , said ."
2002-04-04,"Afghan security officials said today they have arrested hundreds of people in connection with an alleged plot to bomb the capital and overthrow the government of the interim prime minister , Hamid Karzai .
Din Muhammad Jurat , the director general for security at the interior ministry , said most of those arrested were members of Hezb - e - Islami , a hardline Islamic group headed by former prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
"" They wanted to launch a coup d'etat against the government , "" said Mohammed Naseer , the security director at the Kabul governor 's office , adding that 350 people had been arrested .
The alleged plot included plans to set off bombs throughout Kabul , officials said .
Mr Naseer said the plotters also wanted to disrupt the loya jirga , a political gathering planned for June to select a new Afghan government .
The whereabouts of Mr Hekmatyar himself are not known .
He fled to Iran after the Taliban took the capital in 1996 , although the Iranian government recently closed his offices in Tehran .
Afghan officials did not describe what evidence led them to carry out the sweeps .
However , Lt Col Neal Peckham , a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force peacekeepers , said weapons had been found and that those arrested also included Pakistani members of another militant group , the Jamaat - e - Islami , the main supporter of Mr Hekmatyar in Pakistan .
He said the peacekeepers were not involved in the operations , but had been tipped off beforehand .
Some 600 people were rounded up in the raids , and 250 released , said another Western official in Kabul , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The official said ten were being held on suspicion of serious offences , including terrorism , .
The roundups could heighten tensions between Pashtuns , Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group , and the Northern Alliance , which is dominated by ethnic Tajiks and which controls the interior and other key ministries .
Mr Hekmatyar 's following is largely Pashtun .
Pashtun leaders may interpret the arrests as an attempt to stifle their moves toward Pashtun unity in advance of the loya jirga .
On Monday , Afghan police raided the home of Mr Hekmatyar 's one - time aide , Wahidullah Sabaoon , but there was some confusion today over his whereabouts .
General Jurat and Mr Naseer said Mr Sabaoon was among those arrested in the sweep , but Lt Col Peckham said he was still at large .
Mr Sabaoon was once the military chief of Hezb - e - Islami and served as Afghanistan 's defence minister in 1995 , when Mr Hekmatyar became prime minister under former president Burhanuddin Rabbani .
When the Taliban took over the country in 1996 , Mr Sabaoon allied himself with the northern resistance , becoming the finance minister for the government - in - exile .
Mr Hekmatyar has been a vocal opponent of Mr Karzai and of the US presence on Afghan soil , but last month his deputy , Jumma Khan Hamdard , said the party was ready to cooperate with the interim administration .
A senior leader of Hezb - e - Islami , Qutbuddin Hilal , said those arrested were no longer members of the group .
"" There is no truth in these reports that our men are being arrested , "" Mr Hilal said .
Mr Naseer said the men arrested "" were linked to both al - Qaida and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , "" but he refused to elaborate .
Gen Jurat said the interim administration had documents and strong evidence that linked Mr Hekmatyar to the plot , but made no mention of al - Qaida ."
2002-04-05,"Afghan security forces in Kabul have arrested hundreds of people from a hardline Islamic group after apparently uncovering a plot to overthrow Hamid Karzai , the head of the interim government .
At least 600 people have been detained in the past week , although only 350 are in custody .
A senior interior ministry official said the suspects were members of the hardline Hezb - i - Islami , run by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , the former prime minister and a feared warlord .
The men had planned a series of bombs across Kabul , said General Din Mohammad Jurat , director - general for security at the interior ministry .
Mohammad Naseer , the head of security at the Kabul governor 's office , said : "" They wanted to launch a coup d'etat against the government . ""
He said they intended to disrupt the loya jirga , the grand council being called in June to decide Afghanistan 's future .
No evidence has been released to explain the threat , although the former Afghan king , Zahir Shah , delayed his return to Kabul last month after 11th - hour security fears .
Mr Hekmatyar is known to be opposed to the king and the US presence in Afghanistan
A senior leader of Hezb - i - Islami , Qutbuddin Hilal , said those arrested were former members .
"" There is no truth in these reports that our men are being arrested , "" he said .
The arrests are likely to worsen ethnic tensions in Afghanistan 's fragile peace .
Most of those now in government are ethnic Tajiks from the Northern Alliance .
However , Mr Hekmatyar is a Pashtun from Kunduz , in the north , and his predominantly Pashtun party is an old rival of the alliance .
Mr Hekmatyar was responsible for destroying much of Kabul during the years of mojahedin factional fighting in the mid-1990s .
When the Taliban came to power he fled to Tehran until his office was closed late last year .
The warlord then disappeared , but was rumoured to have returned to Afghanistan , where he was thought to be moving through villages near the eastern city of Jalalabad .
On Monday , Afghan police raided the Kabul home of Wahidullah Sabaoon , a former Hekmatyar aide .
It was not clear whether Mr Sabaoon was still in custody .
An imposing figure with a long , silver beard , Mr Sabaoon was once Mr Hekmatyar 's military chief but left after the Taliban seized the capital .
For the past six years he worked alongside the alliance , even appearing on the frontline to meet Ahmad Shah Masood , the alliance military chief assassinated two days before September 11 .
Across the Pakistan border , police arrested another 23 militants suspected of links to al - Qaida .
In the North West Frontier Province police detained 21 members of Harkat - ul Mojahedin , a banned guerrilla group listed as a terrorist organisation by the US .
In a second raid in Lahore two Tunisians were arrested near a known al - Qaida safehouse .
At least 100 people have been arrested in the past week in a new operation closely co - ordinated with US intelligence .
The biggest catch so far has been Abu Zubaydah , one of Osama bin Laden 's senior lieutenants , who was caught in Faisalabad last week .
Pakistani police said another man arrested in Lahore on Monday , a Libyan named Abdul Hadi , was also close to bin Laden ."
2002-04-05,"An ambitious programme designed to destroy Afghanistan 's opium crop , the source of 90 % of the heroin reaching Britain 's streets , will be launched on Monday with the support of the European Union and the US .
Hamid Karzai 's interim administration agreed unanimously this week to a decree that offers Afghan farmers £ 175 for every jerib ( about 2sq km ) of opium poppies they destroy . ""
The holy religion of Islam is categorical about the evil impact of drugs , "" says the decree .
"" We are determined to eradicate the current poppy crop "" .
The European commission announced yesterday that it would give £ 17.5 m to help regions dependent on poppy production find alternative sources of income .
Chris Patten , the EU 's external affairs commissioner , said in Brussels : "" In recent years the overwhelming majority of the opium - related drugs on Europe 's streets has come from Afghanistan , where they devastate young lives and fund organised crime .
Beating drugs helps beat terrorism and will help Afghans have a brighter future . ""
Senior Foreign Office officials described the Afghan decree as a brave step , but one that would succeed only with the moral and financial help of the international community .
The Taliban regime banned poppy cultivation in 2000 .
The ban was reimposed by the Karzai administration in January , but it was too late for this year 's crop , which will be ready for picking in the next few weeks .
The UN development programme estimates that up to 600sq kms are under cultivation , producing up to 2,700 tonnes of opium , enough to make 270 tonnes of heroin .
Farmers who refuse to destroy their crop of opium poppies will have their land confiscated and be prosecuted , the decree says .
The Karzai administration has offered Afghan farmers and labourers who depend on the opium crop work on projects such as road - building and irrigation .
British officials admitted yesterday that the poppy eradication would inevitably lead to some "" extremely unhappy people "" .
Poppy growers rely on drug traffickers for loans which they pay back through their harvest . ""
Usury is strictly forbidden by our holy religion and should have no place in an Islamic society , "" the decree says .
It says that international experts are being consulted to set up a new system to enable farmers to obtain "" reliable credit "" ."
2002-04-10,"Violent protests flared across Afghanistan yesterday as poppy farmers resisted government efforts to eradicate crops which could supply tonnes of heroin to the west .
The farmers blocked roads on the border with Pakistan and hurled rocks at vehicles after gunbattles with security forces left dozens of people dead and injured .
Thousands of refugees trying to return home were stranded on the roads amid chaotic scenes which rattled the fragile interim administration of Hamid Karzai , already struggling to contain warlords and Islamist guerrillas .
Tribal poppy farmers in the south and east fired on officials tasked with eradicating the opium crops on the eve of harvesting , reportedly killing one official and injuring four in a test of resolve for an anti - drug campaign monitored by western aid donors .
The government offered compensation for destroyed crops , but the farmers complained that the cash would not cover their costs , let alone match the market value .
A convoy of 700 vehicles ferrying 14,000 refugees from the Pakistani border town of Torkham to the Afghan town of Jalalabad was stranded when Shenwari tribesmen blocked the highway and smashed windscreens .
Officials did not not rule out the possibility that Monday 's unsuccessful assassination attempt against the Afghan defence minister , Mohammed Fahim , during a visit to Jalalabad , was the work of angry farmers rather than Islamist guerrillas .
The bomb killed four bystanders and forced the closure yesterday of an aid centre for refugees , compounding unrest in the city .
In the southern province of Helmand on Sunday , security forces fired on a rally of 2,000 farmers that was allegedly turning into a riot .
Eight farmers were killed and 16 injured , said the provincial governor , Sher Mohammed .
Others said that at least 35 were wounded .
In fields all over the country , water pumps are clanking into action and labourers with scythes are clearing weeds in preparation for harvesting the green bulbs which are on the verge of flowering .
Afghanistan once supplied 75 % of the world 's opium , the raw material for heroin , but in 2000 the Taliban banned cultivation , eliminating an estimated 96 % of last year 's crop .
When the Islamist regime fell last December , farmers invested in seeds and materials for renewed cultivation , gambling that the new government would not have the will or ability to prevent a harvest which offers the only income for many communities .
The government is offering some $ 500 ( £ 350 ) for each destroyed acre , but farmers claim that fertiliser , seeds , tractor rental , water pumps , fuel and labourers cost them $ 800 an acre .
Warlords expecting a cut of the profits have warned the government not to interfere , an official in Kabul said .
Protests outside the governor 's office in Lashkar Gah , capital of Helmand province , turned into stone - throwing attacks against the security forces , and shops were burned , said a local commander , Amir Sultan Mohammed .
Officials rented hundreds of tractors for Monday 's launch of the eradication programme , but several opium - growing heartlands in the south have yet to see any attempted destruction .
"" Nobody has come from the police or the government , "" said Abdul Samad , a farmer near Kandahar .
"" I wo n't let them eradicate my field .
I 'll tell them I 'll turn to thievery .
So it 's better if they leave us alone . ""
According to the UN there are more than 100,000 acres of poppy in Afghanistan , a huge logistical task for an under - resourced anti - drug campaign .
The EU has pledged $ 25 m to help .
Russia yesterday protested at the lack of action against the flow of narcotics . ""
As far as we can tell , not a single factory has been destroyed , "" said Konstantin Totsky , director of the federal border service .
Border guards patrolling the frontier between Tajikistan and Afghanistan seized 350 kg ( 770 lb ) of narcotics during the first three months of this year , most of it heroin , he said ."
2002-04-15,"Brushing aside fears of assassination , the former king of Afghanistan , Zahir Shah , is expected to return this week from three decades of exile to oversee a potentially fraught period of transition to a new government .
Hundreds of police officers sealed off roads and set up checkpoints outside Kabul airport at the weekend to rehearse for the 87-year - old 's homecoming , while workmen raced to finish his new home .
The leader of the interim government , Hamid Karzai , will fly to Rome to collect the monarch and return with him to Kabul , possibly by tomorrow , a spokesman for the prime minister said .
Italian officials would not specify the day for security reasons but the US embassy was reported to be expecting him on Thursday .
The overthrow of Zahir Shah in 1973 ended a 40-year rule considered a golden era of peace and prosperity - particularly in comparison with the coups , mayhem and war which unfolded soon after , culminating in last autumn 's defeat of the Taliban .
The western - backed interim authority is due to end a six - month term in June , when a traditional assembly known as a loya jirga selects a new government , paving the way for elections 18 months later .
The former king will return as an ordinary citizen but he will convene the assembly and , in theory , act as a father of the nation in an effort to unite ethnic and tribal factions .
In reality his main role will be to reassure his fellow Pashtuns , the country 's largest ethnic group , that Tajiks from the north will not repeat their dominance of the interim authority in the assembly and transitional government .
Hardline Tajiks resent him but the Tajik foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , will accompany him from Rome as evidence that he will be safe in a capital that has witnessed attacks against peacekeepers and alleged terrorist plots .
Islamist groups and others hostile to the loya jirga know that assassinating the former king is a short cut to disrupting a process which could exclude them from power .
Zahir Shah said he was returning for good and was unafraid of threats .
"" I 'm fully aware of what has transpired since I left .
I 'm fully aware of the destruction .
Although all these things make me sad , I 'm confident we will rebuild Kabul . """
2002-04-18,"The former king of Afghanistan today returned to Kabul for the first time in nearly 30 years .
Stepping off an Italian air force plane to be greeted by the country 's interim leader , Hamid Karzai , and six of his cabinet members ,
Mohammed Zahir Shah was caught in a crowd of children , diplomats , tribal leaders and a few warlords .
About two dozen international peacekeepers kept a close watch from the control tower at Kabul airport .
Thousands of people lined the route from the airport to the former king 's villa , trying to catch a glimpse of him .
Dancers in white tunics and red sashes swirled to the beat of drums and a flute , and people from across the country held up photographs of the ex - king and Afghan flags .
"" This is a sacred day , "" said Jawaz Ismaelkhel , wearing the black turban and long white beard of his tribe in the eastern Khost province .
"" I think all Afghans hope he will bring peace to the country . ""
The last monarch of Afghanistan 's 200-year - old Durrani dynasty , Zahir Shah fled to Rome into 1973 and was overthrown by a cousin who declared a republic .
There are no plans to restore the monarchy but many believe the 87-year - old former king can serve as a unifying force as Afghanistan seeks to recover from 23 years of war .
Few observers expect him to be more than a benevolent father figure for a traumatised nation , but he will convene a loya jirga ( national grand council ) in June to select a new government to rule until elections in late 2003 . ""
His majesty said it was a great day for Afghanistan , and he 's very happy to be back , "" Mr Karzai 's chief spokesman Yusuf Nuristani said , emerging from the former king 's residence . ""
He 's a little bit tired , because it was a long trip , but otherwise he 's joyous . ""
Zalmay Rassoul , the ex - king 's former spokesman in Rome who is now Afghanistan 's tourism minister , said the king had become a "" new man "" since the US - led war against the Taliban made his homecoming possible .
But not everyone in Afghanistan is celebrating , and some resent Zahir Shah for spending Afghanistan 's years of turmoil in Rome ."
2002-04-19,"Afghanistan 's former king Zahir Shah , wearing a flat cap and a tailored Italian leather coat , ended his 29 years of exile yesterday when he stepped off an Italian military plane at Kabul airport .
Flanked by Hamid Karzai , the leader of the country 's interim government , the frail 87-year - old walked past the dozens of wrecked planes that line the runway before riding in a black Mercedes to the modest villa that will be his home for the foreseeable future .
Hundreds of people waved Afghan flags , banged drums and cheered as the motorcade drove through the sunny , tree - lined streets of the capital .
But in the centre of Kabul his arrival seemed to make little difference to the shopkeepers , their thronging clients , or the usual heavy traffic .
The former king had spent the night in Tashkent , Uzbekistan , after leaving his home in Rome on Wednesday .
His return , first mooted after the Taliban 's fall in November , was repeatedly delayed because of security fears .
Heavily armed soldiers from the international peacekeeping force and Afghan troops lined the road to the airport , while tanks and other armoured vehicles stood by .
Even those accredited to watch the king 's arrival had to pass through five checkpoints where clothes and bags were carefully inspected .
There were fears that a Stinger missile might be used in an assassination attempt .
Many Afghans did not want to see their former ruler return .
Zahir Shah , like Mr Karzai , is from the Pashtun ethnic group , and many from Afghanistan 's other ethnic minorities fear that his return may herald a new period of Pashtun domination .
The Tajik forces which captured Kabul six months ago have substantial power and see the king as a threat .
But Mr Zahir flew back to Kabul as an ordinary citizen , with just one official assigned to his staff .
In June , he will open a loya jirga , or grand council , which will choose a new interim government to rule for 18 months until a general election .
The council 's 1,500 delegates from around the country are now being selected .
Supporters hope that the respect traditionally afforded to such a senior elder will help to unite rival ethnic groups under a single national banner .
His mere return is a powerful symbol of progress towards some kind of lasting peace in Afghanistan , they say .
Zahir Shah 's reign from 1933 , when a deranged student shot his father , to 1973 , when he was deposed by a cousin while undergoing medical treatment for lumbago , is seen by older Afghans , particularly Pashtuns , as a golden era . ""
Since he left we have n't had any good times in our country , "" said Gholam Nabi , a 45-year - old army officer .
"" We consider this a new day . ""
For the moment Afghan politicians are doing their best to appear united .
Senior representatives of all the rival factions turned out to greet him , from General Abdul Rashid Dostam , the Uzbek warlord who is deputy defence minister , to Mirwais Khan , the son of Ismail Khan , the fractious governor of Herat .
Concern about the king 's health is being played down .
Zalmay Rassoul , his former spokesman in Rome who is now Afghanistan 's tourism minister , said the king had been reinvigorated since the US - led war against the Taliban made his homecoming possible : "" He 's a new man . ""
Last night all the lights were on in the two - storey house in the upmarket , if slightly battered , district of Wazir Akbar Khan where the king was to spend his first night .
Outside , a heavy security presence kept onlookers - and the first petitioners - away .
The king does not want to leave his homeland again .
"" I 'd like to dedicate the last few years of my life to the people of Afghanistan and to my country , "" he told reporters this week .
Mirwais , a bicycle seller in Kabul 's main market , said : "" I hope he brings peace .
But I 've learned not to hope too much . ""
Harder - nosed interests but similar sentiments boosted the currency from 34,000 to 25,000 afghanis to the dollar yesterday ."
2002-04-30,"Al - Qaida and Taliban fighters captured by British forces in Afghanistan will be handed over to Afghan authorities and not the Americans , British military sources said yesterday .
British officials say they have been told by Hamid Karzai , the interim Afghan administration 's leader , that any detainees will be well cared for .
The Afghans say that they will give captives prisoner of war status and follow conditions laid down in the Geneva convention .
In designating al - Qaida captives "" legal combatants "" , the British government will be differing significantly from Washington .
The Americans consider men who fought with Bin Laden 's group to be "" illegal combatants "" .
As such , they would not be entitled to the protection of PoW status . ""
As a matter of policy it 's been decided that every detainee we take will be treated as a prisoner of war under the Geneva convention , "" said one of the sources , who asked not to be identified .
The sources stressed they would not be formally conceding PoW status to detainees , merely treating them as such .
The fate of any British al - Qaida fighter would have to be decided by London , the sources added .
If Osama bin Laden or a key aide were captured , a tribunal might be set up to determine his status ."
2002-05-10,"The CIA fired a missile from a drone aircraft in an attempt to kill Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a former Afghan prime minister and faction leader who is suspected of plotting to attack western troops and overthrow the interim government of Hamid Karzai , American reports said yesterday .
There was no official comment on the reported attack , which if confirmed would mark the first time the US has used its firepower to try to resolve factional conflict in post - Taliban Afghanistan .
Mr Hekmatyar 's Hezb - i - Islami movement is a militant Islamic , mainly Pashtun group , but it has no ties to either the Taliban or al - Qaida .
The New York Times and NBC News said the attack was mounted outside Kabul from a Predator drone but failed to kill the warlord , who was armed and supported by the CIA in the 1980s during the war against Soviet occupation .
He returned from exile in Iran last month and soon afterwards the interim government arrested scores of his followers , accusing them of plotting a coup against Mr Karzai and the former king , Mohammed Zahir Shah .
According to the US reports , American officials claimed to have convincing intelligence that Mr Hekmatyar was still plotting to oust the interim government and attack allied forces in Afghanistan .
One official quoted by the New York Times said he had "" actively pursued terrorist acts against Americans , both in terms of offering rewards to people to kill Americans and in plotting terrorist attacks against Americans "" .
Reports of the attack were vague , with one official quoted as saying that Mr Hekmatyar had been in a convoy , and another saying he had been standing in a group of people .
NBC reported that several of his lieutenants were killed in the attack .
A Pentagon official contacted yesterday said it was defence department policy not to comment on CIA operations .
The CIA never confirms or denies any of its operations .
Mr Hekmatyar emerged as the prime minister of a makeshift coalition government in 1992 , following the fall of a Soviet - backed regime , but the government soon collapsed amid fierce fighting between his troops and rival factions which destroyed much of Kabul .
He fled to Iran when the Taliban captured the ruined city in 1996 .
Iran evicted him in April , possibly in response to US demands , and Mr Hekmatyar arrived back in Afghanistan determined to take on all foreign forces .
In an interview two months before his return , he accused Mr Karzai of being a foreign puppet . ""
While foreign troops are present , the interim government does not have any value or meaning , "" he said .
"" We prefer involvement in internal war rather than occupation by foreigners and foreign troops . ""
The CIA 's armed Predator drones were first used in battle in the first days of the Afghan war , in an unsuccessful attempt to kill the Taliban leader , Mullah Mohammed Omar .
Last November they were used more successfully in an attack on a house near Kabul in which al - Qaida 's operations chief , Mohammed Atef , was killed ."
2002-06-03,"Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan 's interim leader , last night appeared to have won the support of enough key allies to stay on as head of the government for the next two years .
For days the Afghan cabinet and warlords from across the country have been haggling over the make - up of the government which will emerge after next week 's loya jirga , the council which is to shape Afghanistan 's political future .
All have backed Mr Karzai to stay on.""This is a big achievement and development , "" the Afghan foreign ministry said .
"" Fortunately , there is this general understanding about the continuation of the current political system . ""
The backroom deals which produced Mr Karzai 's endorsement suggest that many of the most important decisions for the loya jirga are being made in private before the 1,500 delegates meet next week in Kabul .
The dominant Pashtun community hopes that the loya jirga will correct the imbalance of the current interim government , which is dominated by Tajik warlords from the Northern Alliance who swept into Kabul as the Taliban fled .
But many fear the Northern Alliance leaders are working hard to retain power , particularly in the key defence and interior ministries .
The loya jirga is supposed to debate the type of government which will rule Afghanistan for the next two years before the scheduled elections .
In an attempt to assuage Pashtun concerns , the former king , Zahir Shah , himself a Pashtun , is expected to be made head of state .
But Mr Shah , 87 , appears increasingly frail .
Yesterday he cancelled his first tour of the country since he returned in April after 30 years ' exile in Rome .
Mr Shah 's secretary said he was "" a little sick "" and had postponed a visit to Kandahar and Mazar - e - Sharif .
The trip was intended to promote ethnic unity at a time when warlords are once again carving up the provinces of Afghanistan .
His visit to Kandahar , an important religious city and the heartland of the Pashtuns , was intended to signal to the Pashtun community that they were being included in the coming negotiations .
Already there have been complaints about the way candidates for the loya jirga have been selected .
At least eight people have been murdered and several potential candidates in the north have been told by warlords not to stand .
Elections began in southern Afghanistan yesterday to choose delegates for next week 's meeting .
There have already been problems in the province of Zabul , where many Taliban leaders were thought to have fled .
While many Afghans believe the loya jirga will also accelerate the reconstruction of their country , even that hope now seems slim .
Nigel Fisher , the UN envoy for recovery , relief and reconstruction , said the Afghan government had so far received only $ 45 m out of an internationally - pledged annual budget of $ 400 m ."
2002-06-11,"Afghanistan 's former president , Burhaunddin Rabbani , today ruled himself out of the running to become the country 's next leader .
His decision - announced hours before the convening of a loya jirga ( grand council ) called to decide on a head of state - means that Afghanistan 's current leader , Hamid Karzai , is likely to be re - appointed by the 1,550 delegates in Kabul .
"" I am proposing Chairman Karzai as the sole candidate before the loya jirga , "" Mr Rabbani told reporters .
The president of a post - communist Afghanistan in 1992 and titular head of the Northern Alliance , Mr Rabbani was widely considered to be Mr Karzai 's main challenger .
Although Kabul was lost to the Taliban in 1996 Mr Rabbani remained Afghanistan 's internationally recognised president until the end of last year when talks in Bonn , Germany , appointed Mr Karzai the interim leader .
The ex - king , Mohammed Zahir Shah , also stood down yesterday , leaving the way clear for Mr Karzai .
An aide read out a statement , as the 87-year - old former monarch sat quietly , saying he did not want the monarchy restored or to be a candidate for president .
A day - long delay to the start of the loya jirga was blamed on ethnic Tajiks in the current interim administration objecting to the former king as a candidate for the top job .
But the series of bowings out has created tensions in the loya jirga , where the delegates may feel backroom deals are taking all the important decisions out of their control .
"" People feel their rights have been taken away from them , "" said one European diplomat , who refused to be quoted by name .
An Afghan delegate to the loya jirga , who uses only one name , Mirwais , said : "" It is for us to decide what role the king has .
If we want or do n't want the king , it is for us to decide and then the king can say whether he accepts or not . ""
The 1,550 delegates - representing a cross section of Afghan society - are to begin the historic meeting by selecting a head of state , one of their first orders of business .
The new government will write a new constitution and oversee preparations for nationwide elections .
Tensions were high at the loya jirga site amid worries about how delegates would act once the session starts , with lots of grumbling about intimidation and attempts to coerce delegates .
Some delegates assailed Mr Rabbani and the defence minister , Mohammad Fahim , last night , accusing them of cheating them of their rights to decide on the former king 's role - or lack of one .
Security was tight , with international peacekeepers inside and outside the massive air - conditioned tent .
Although the interim leader , Mr Karzai , is an ethnic Pashtun , the most important ministries in his administration are controlled by ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks , and many ethnic Pashtuns - who formed the majority of the Taliban - and Hazaras feel marginalised by the make - up of the Kabul government .
"" It 's not just Pashtuns , it is Tajiks , Uzbeks and Hazaras who want the king because all these other leaders are fighters , "" said one Kabul resident , Eid Mohammed .
"" They are the reason why our country has been destroyed . ""
The US envoy to Afghanistan , Zalmay Khalilzad , urged all ethnic groups to put aside past rivalries and use the loya jirga to form a broad - based government .
He said "" significant "" changes must occur for the transitional government to be accepted by most Afghans . ""
It is important that there is a significant change and not merely a symbolic one , "" he said .
"" Hopefully , they have learned their lessons . """
2002-06-12,"Hamid Karzai has apparently succeeded in winning a second term as Afghanistan 's leader yesterday after the loya jirga , the grand tribal council , finally opened a day late .
The former king , Zahir Shah , urged delegates to support Mr Karzai , whose only serious rival , former president Burhanuddin Rabbani , bowed out of the race .
Last night , the foreign minister , Abdukkah Abdullah , said : "" Today the people showed their support for his [ Karzai 's ] candidacy , but this was not the official ceremonial procedure of endorsing his candidacy . ""
Although many of the approximately 1,500 delegates angrily denounced a deal - achieved under American pressure - which led to Zahir Shah renouncing all political ambitions on Monday , they were unlikely to be able to reverse the decision .
Mr Karzai , a Pashtun nobleman , tried to mollify Zahir Shah 's supporters yesterday by announcing that the former monarch would have the title of "" father of the nation "" and be given the powers and status of an unofficial head of state .
The former king 's roles would include approving a new constitution , taking part in national celebrations and awarding medals and titles to Afghans for distinguished service .
The 87-year - old former monarch would also be able to move from the Kabul villa where he has lived since he re turned from exile in Italy in April and return to the royal palace .
The concessions were apparently enough to persuade Zahir Shah to abandon any thought of real power .
The concessions were also part of a deal to get the powerful Tajiks from the Panjshir valley to accept Mr Karzai as leader until elections in two years ' time .
The Tajiks include the defence minister , interior minister and foreign minister .
Mr Rabbani , another Tajik , had previously been sidelined in December when Mr Karzai was first appointed .
Despite still having presidential ambitions , he pulled out of the leadership race yesterday , though not without a reminder that he was political leader of the Northern Alliance , which took control of Kabul after the Taliban retreated under the weight of massive American bombing last November .
"" We came into Kabul as warriors and conquerors .
We had full control of the city .
But we made concessions then for the best interest of the country .
Now we do this again , "" he said .
In a further step in the evolving package of mutual concessions and compromise between the Pashtuns and the Tajiks - the country 's largest groups - Yunis Qanuni , the interior minister , told the loya jirga he was resigning so that Mr Karzai would have a free hand . ""
Everyone should make a sacrifice and follow the example of Ahmed Shah Massoud who gave his life last year , "" he said .
Mr Massoud , the former mojahedin commander , was assassinated by suspected Taliban or al - Qaida supporters in September .
After a day 's delay , expectations were high in the giant tent as the moment for the ceremonial opening of the loya jirga approached yesterday afternoon .
But , as speculation was mounting that Monday 's deal was unravelling or that Zahir Shah might be using ill - health to boycott the session , the former monarch appeared an hour late , with Mr Karzai at his side .
In a barely audible voice , he told delegates : "" By the will of God , after 29 years of exile , I 'm back in my country with my nation .
My only wish is to bring peace , unity and reconciliation and take the nation back to peace and integrity .
"" I am ready to help the people , and Hamid Karzai is my candidate , "" he said , urging delegates to recognise Mr Karzai 's "" ideals of national unity and democracy based on Islamic values "" .
In a contradictory speech to the assembly , Mr Karzai said : "" Private armies should be eliminated .
Warlordism should be removed "" , but went on to name and praise several warlords , including Ismail Khan , the governor of Herat ."
2002-06-13,"Afghanistan 's interim leader , Hamid Karzai , was overwhelmingly elected head of state today by a grand council meeting of Afghan leaders .
He won 1,295 votes in the loya jirga - a one - off Afghan grand council - and will take charge of an interim government until elections in 2004 .
His main rivals for the post had stood down before the meeting began .
Also nominated for the post were Masooda Jalal , a female employee of the World Food Programme , Glam Fareq Majidi and Mir Mohammed Mahfoz Nadai .
No details were immediately available about Mr Majidi and Mr Nadai .
Ismail Qasim Yar , head of the loya jirga commission , said that Ms Jalal received 171 votes and Mr Nadai received 89 .
Mr Karzai received a thunderous applause when the announcement was made .
Ms Jalal had addressed the delegates earlier today , calling herself a simple Afghan woman who was not involved in any armed group .
"" I thank God that after so many difficulties , the sun is rising over our country , "" she said .
After the election for head of state - delayed for a day after delegates argued over the presence of warlords - the council is due to start on the mechanics of how the transitional government will be set up , including the number of cabinet ministers .
Many delegates believe the US and other powerbrokers have cut deals - including the withdrawals by the former monarch Mohammed Zahir Shah and ex - president Burhanuddin Rabbani from contention for head of state - that were circumventing the loya jirga process .
"" Everything seems to have been decided .
But we do n't need anyone to decide for us , "" said delegate Asella Wardak .
"" We have had enough of foreign interference in our country . ""
Some delegates have also questioned the participation of warlords and former commanders , once hailed as heroes but now reviled for having plunged the country into more war after they drove out the Soviet Union in 1989 .
"" We were told that this loya jirga would not include all the people who had blood on their hands , "" said Safar Mohammed , drawing applause from fellow delegates .
"" But we see these people everywhere .
I do n't know whether this is a loya jirga or a commanders ' council . ""
Former guerrilla leaders rose to defend those who they said had waged a holy war against the Soviets .
"" We should distinguish between mujahedeen and a gunman , "" said Abdul Rasul Sayyaf , whose Ittehad - e - Islami party was notorious for attacking ethnic Hazaras after the Soviets withdrew .
"" These people who had guns defeated the Russians .
This loya jirga is a result of their actions .
"" The interim administration 's foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , denied speculation that the withdrawals of the former king and Mr Rabbini were the result of heavy - handed US interference to ensure balanced ethnic composition of the new government .
The ex - king 's decision to withdraw , announced by the US envoy to Afghanistan three hours before Zahir Shah 's own statement , "" should not be considered imposing pressure "" , Dr Abdullah said .
But sidelining the former monarch could backfire if other ethnic Pashtuns feel marginalised by the next administration .
Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan but Mr Karzai 's interim administration is dominated by ethnic Tajiks , whose Northern Alliance forces moved into Kabul after the Taliban fled US - led bombing .
"" We told them they are playing with war , "" said Michael Pohly , a German observer , emphasizing that 800 - 900 delegates had come out in support of a role for the ex - king on Monday night .

2002-06-14,"Hamid Karzai , the interim leader of Afghanistan , was voted into power for two more years yesterday by more than two - thirds of the 1,500 delegates at the loya jirga ( grand tribal council ) .
He won 1,295 votes , to 171 for Massouda Jalal , the first woman in Afghan history to seek the post of head of state , and 89 votes for a little known government official .
Barely six months after the fall of the fundamentalist Taliban regime , which prohibited women taking jobs , or even appearing in public with their faces visible , Ms Jalal 's insistence on standing was impressive .
She told reporters that she had been offered a cabinet post if she stood down , but had refused .
The use of a secret ballot to choose the next leader was a big step forward for the council .
When the chairman said the procedure could be a show of hands or a ballot , delegates rushed to the microphones to call for secrecy to avoid intimidation .
Even Mr Karzai said he agreed with secret voting , a change from his behaviour on the first day of the week - long assembly , when he was endorsed by the former king and made a speech which sounded as though he presumed he would not be challenged .
In fact Ms Jalal , an employee of the World Food Programme , and two men put their names forward .
One man 's candidacy was declared invalid because he had only 101 of the 150 signatures needed on his nomination papers .
Although many delegates have criticised the backroom deals made on the eve of this week 's meeting , and the prominence of warlords in the front rows , there was widespread satisfaction yesterday that the spirit of debate and the open contest for places had been more intense than expected .
In Kabul people have been watching the live transmissions on television , or listening to the radio , amazed at the unrestrained arguments .
It is easy to be critical , but the loya jirga has allowed the country to leapfrog ahead of its neighbours in the five states of the former Soviet Central Asia , which remain dictatorships .
Yesterday the mood was reminiscent of the first parliament elected in the Soviet Union in March 1989 , after Mikhail Gorbachev allowed contested elections .
Then too the country came to a virtual halt as people watched or listened to the unprecedentedly open debates .
"" I am a Muslim woman and I have rights "" , Ms Jalal told the delegates in the giant air - conditioned tent as she outlined her policies and principles . ""
Fifty per cent of our people are women , and although we do not have that proportion here [ only 200 of the delegates are women ] , at least we are represented , "" she said .
"" For over two centuries there has been a cruel betrayal of women .
This is a golden time for the people of Afghanistan .
Now is the time to forget the clashes and conflicts of the past .
We need national unity . ""
She called for social justice and equal rights , saying : "" We should disarm the warlords and have a truly national army and police force . ""
Mr Karzai said he was happy that "" after 25 years , all Afghans are gathering under one tent "" .
"" The refugees are coming back .
It is a proud moment for me "" .
Switching between Pashtu and Dari , the main languages , he said "" We need security , we need peace , we need stability , we need an administration in control of all of Afghanistan "" .
He appeared to hold out an olive branch to Afghans who became Taliban out of ignorance or under pressure .
"" I know many Taliban .
They were taken over , hijacked by foreigners "" , he said , without naming the main foreign backers , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia ."
2002-06-17,"Afghanistan 's loya jirga , charged with appointing a government for the country , suffered another wave of walkouts today ahead of an address by the newly - elected Afghan leader Hamid Karzai .
Some reports said that up to 90 % of the 1,650 delegates had walked out of the one - off Afghan grand council amid an apparent log - jam over ways of appointing the country 's new legislature .
The meeting degenerated into arguments and accusations yesterday over what kind of legislature should represent the fragmented population of Afghanistan .
Delegates recorded their frustration at the endless speeches and lack of action .
"" We are just repeating the same discussions and hearing the same things , "" said delegate Abdul Qader Khan of Kandahar .
"" There are issues that should be discussed .
Karzai should have come here earlier and announced a cabinet that is balanced .
"" Talks have stalled amid arguments over whether to endorse an assembly based on geographic or racial divisions .
Some ethnic groups , notably the dominant Pashtuns , fear a loss of power if the new assembly is based on geography .
There are 32 provinces in Afghanistan and roughly half are Pashtun - dominated .
Mr Karzai met with delegates last night to discuss their concerns and proposals .
Nevertheless , frustration spread among delegates that decisions were being made without their participation . ""
On a scale of zero to 100 , I would put the progress at zero , "" said Omar Zakhilwal , a delegate representing Jalalabad .
"" It 's been seven days and all we 've done is elect a president - with a result that was predetermined .
"" I think this loya jirga is not about changing the system .
This change has been resisted through intimidation , pressure , bribery and persuasion . ""
The traditional loya jirga was convened last Tuesday under a UN blueprint .
It drew more than 1,600 Afghan delegates from around the country and abroad in a two - step selection process that critics said was rife with intimidation and harassment .
It was supposed to end yesterday , but has so far accomplished only one of its main tasks - choosing a president , which it did on Thursday .
Still to be resolved are the composition of the cabinet and the form of the legislature .
In other developments , the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said two Americans were among several people detained after trying to enter the country from Afghanistan ."
2002-06-18,"Powerful Islamic fundamentalists have launched a fierce attack on Sima Samar , the minister of women 's affairs , accusing her of blasphemy , labelling her "" Afghanistan 's Salman Rushdie "" and demanding that she be given "" appropriate punishment "" which , under sharia law , means death .
The onslaught on Ms Samar , one of only two women ministers in President Hamid Karzai 's government , is the high point so far in a surge of confidence by fundamentalists who have been allowed to dominate the grand tribal council , or loya jirga , in Kabul in the past few days .
It appears in the form of a front - page headline and half - page letter from "" a reader in Kabul "" to the editor of Mujahed ( Soldier of God ) , a weekly newspaper published by Jamiat - e - Islami , the party run by the former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani .
The letter , titled "" Afghanistan 's Salman Rushdie ? "" , claims that Ms Samar told a Canadian newspaper in April : "" I do n't believe in sharia "" .
Although sharia 's relevance to the complexities of modern life is debated , every Muslim is expected to accept its principles . ""
In Afghanistan holy sharia still rules , "" the letter adds .
"" Our people know what punishment awaits anyone who insults Islam and the Prophet ...
We ask the judicial authorities to investigate Sima Samar for her insult and prepare the appropriate punishment "" .
Ms Samar reacted to the attack with outward calm yesterday .
"" They are threatening me .
I 'm here and it 's fine ,
so what ?
"" she said .
Mr Karzai last night cut short the arguments about creating a parliament out of the loya jirga , by suggesting that delegates go home and choose four or five people from each electoral zone to remain in touch with him in Kabul .
Underlying Mr Karzai 's thinking , Abdul Qadir , governor of Nangarhar province , pointed out that the agreement which produced the first post - Taliban government in December made no provision for a parliament .
The country first had to write a constitution and then hold elections ."
2002-06-18,"After days of squabbling and delays , the head of the Afghan grand council , the loya jirga , offered a blueprint today for the country 's new legislature .
However , the ethnically contentious issue of the executive cabinet remained unresolved after the newly elected president , Hamid Karzai , said he needed one more day to cobble it together .
Earlier , Ismail Qasim Yar , the chairman of the one - off Afghan grand council , said the new legislature would draw representatives from each province and also include others chosen from among the delegates of the assembly .
Mr Qasim Yar said it would consist of two delegates for each of Afghanistan 's 32 provinces , including 15 seats for women and other seats chosen from within the loya jirga - one for every 20 delegates .
The decision is an apparent compromise to ensure that all ethnic groups , especially the majority Pashtuns , feel represented in the legislative branch of Afghanistan 's transitional government .
Delegates immediately took to the microphones after this announcement to express their views , with some arguing passionately against the decision .
Within minutes , the uproar led Mr Qasim Yar to adjourn the morning session until the afternoon . ""
Brothers , let 's talk .
It should go to a vote .
That would be a democracy , "" said one delegate , Sibghatullah Mojaddidi , who briefly led Afghanistan during a rotating presidency in the 90s .
The six - month transitional administration , which is drawing to its end this week , has no legislative body .
Mr Karzai was expected to announce his choices for key cabinet posts this morning .
At first his address was delayed until this evening , the fourth delay of a Karzai speech .
Then , with the loya jirga already running two days overdue , Mr Karzai told the increasingly restive body of 1,650 delegates that he needed more time decide on ministers for the upcoming 18-month transitional government . ""
If you want a good cabinet , then give me one day more .
I will produce a cabinet acceptable to everyone , "" Mr Karzai said .
"" The work of naming the cabinet is almost done .
This is for the future of the nation .
We have to think about this carefully . . .
it should n't be rushed . ""
He suggested the loya jirga reconvene at 5 pm ( 1230 GMT ) tomorrow . ""
Get some rest , "" he advised the delegates .
Many Afghans have complained that the interim administration 's cabinet is dominated by ethnic Tajiks from the Panjshir Valley who are former members of the Northern Alliance of opposition groups .
Members of this group now control the country 's three most influential ministries - defence , foreign affairs and interior .
Choosing the legislature , which the loya jirga identified last week as one of its chief tasks , stalled during the weekend over disputes about what form it would take .
Though some remain outwardly enthusiastic , many have started expressing disgust at a process of government - shaping which they say is bypassing them entirely .
"" We came here to create a government , and we could n't even do that , "" said Rahima , a female delegate from northern Mazar - e - Sharif .
"" The loya jirga is here , but the decisions are being made somewhere else .
"" Delegates have started groaning and agitating in their seats at each delay , and the cacophony of grousing in the aisles has grown . ""
The people are united .
That is not the problem .
It is the leaders who are not united , "" complained Sheikh Zada , a Kabul delegate .
The loya jirga , based on Afghan tradition , began without a clear agenda .
Delegates widely assumed they would select a new president , approve his cabinet and decide on the form and make up of a new legislature to run the country for 18 months until new elections ."
2002-06-19,"The Afghan leader , Hamid Karzai , today named an executive cabinet for an 18-month transitional administration , dividing key ministries between ethnic Tajiks and Pashtuns , the two dominant ethnic groups in the country .
Delegates of the loya jirga , grand council , charged with endorsing the new government , had voiced concern that the top three cabinet posts would be dominated by ethnic Tajiks from the Panjshir valley , members of the northern alliance of opposition groups who fought the former Taliban regime .
While ethnic Tajiks were named at the head of the powerful defence and foreign ministries , Mr Karzai named an ethnic Pashtun as interior minister .
In all , he named 14 ministers in a long - awaited speech to the 1,650 delegates packed inside a tent in the Afghan capital .
He also appointed three deputy presidents and a chief justice to the country 's highest court , pending approval by the delegates .
Mr Karzai reappointed Mohammed Fahim as defence minister .
The prickly Panjshiri , who controls many of the northern alliance forces in Kabul since the alliance swept into the capital when the Taliban fled in November , has held the post during the interim administration .
Dr Abdullah , a fellow Tajik who had been the northern alliance 's main spokesman during the final weeks of its campaign to retake Kabul , was also reappointed as foreign minister .
However , the newly appointed interior minister , Taj Mohammed Wardak , is a Pashtun , the biggest ethnic group in Afghanistan .
Many delegates , particularly Pashtuns from eastern and southern Afghanistan , said it would be unacceptable to keep power in the top three ministries restricted to Panjshiris .
As such , a Panjshiri who had held the interior ministry post , Yunus Qanooni , was appointed as education minister .
He had offered to resign as interior minister last week when the loya jirga convened .
Mr Karzai also appointed his top adviser , Ashraf Ghani , a former official at the World Bank , as finance minister .
"" If Afghanistan does not have a strong central government , nothing will happen , "" Mr Karzai said .
The interim administration , which took office in late December , has faced problems exerting its authority outside Kabul .
The grand council immediately approved Mr Karzai 's appointments with a show of hands .
None of the country 's major warlords , who wield great influence and command private armies in their regions , were given cabinet posts .
The appointments came after repeated delays that annoyed some loya jirga delegates .
They complained of feeling excluded from the process .
The grand council , which convened a day late on June 11 , has also been plagued by charges that delegates who spoke out - or planned to - were subject to intimidation and harassment .
However , others praised the process as being the first in years that allowed them to speak publicly about issues important to them .
Mr Karzai himself was elected president by the loya jirga last week after six months of leading the interim administration .
He said that the continued fight against Taliban and al - Qaida fighters in eastern Afghanistan would play an important role in the stability of the new government .
"" Terrorists should not be allowed in Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" Terrorism should be finished throughout the world , and Afghanistan is committed to eliminating terrorism ...
We will relieve Afghanistan of this pain . ""
He said that former Taliban members who had "" not committed political crimes "" should be allowed to return home .
The transitional government , which must be in place by Saturday under the UN - brokered Bonn agreement , represents the midpoint of the immediate plan for Afghanistan .
The third phase is a constitutional convention and free elections ."
2002-06-20,"The Afghan leader , Hamid Karzai , ended days of tense negotiations with regional leaders yesterday by announcing a cabinet with power shared between the Tajik and Pashtun ethnic groups .
The top two Tajiks from the Northern Alliance , General Mohammed Fahim , the defence minister , and Dr Abdullah Abdullah , the foreign minister , remained in their posts , but the interior ministry , with its armed police , has gone to a Pashtun provincial governor , Taj Mohammed Wardak .
On the ninth day of the loya jirga weary delegates approved the new team by a show of hands .
The government , the second stage in the process of rebuilding Afghan unity , will operate for 18 months until a new constitution is drafted .
Mr Karzai made no mention of Sima Samar , the minister of women 's affairs , who was recently attacked as a blasphemer by Islamists and called Afghanistan 's "" Salman Rushdie "" .
He said other posts would be announced later .
Although none of the country 's warlords , who have great influence in their regions , has got a cabinet post , their power base will not be affected .
Rather , it highlights their independence from Kabul ."
2002-07-02,"The Afghan government today called for an overhaul of American military strikes in the country , in the wake of apparent US attacks which are believed to have killed dozens of civilians .
In an unprecedented statement , the president , Hamid Karzai , said that coalition forces must "" take all necessary measures to ensure that military activities to capture terrorist groups do not harm innocent Afghan civilians "" .
His intervention came as US and Afghan officials went to investigate the killing of civilians at a wedding party in the village of Kakarak , about 175 miles south - west of the capital of Kabul .
Reports of fatalities varied from up to 40 to more than 100 .
Locals in the village in the central Afghan province of Uruzgan claimed planes attacked the wedding , perhaps mistaking celebratory fire from the party for anti - aircraft fire .
However , US defence officials said tonight that it appeared that gunfire , rather than an errant bomb as first thought , was responsible for the fatalities .
General Peter Pace , vice chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff , revealed that American aircraft attacked six locations , rather than the one previously reported .
However , the US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , said in a Pentagon press conference with Gen Pace : "" It 's really a mistake for us to make judgments about what took place when we know we do n't know . ""
Gen Pace said a US AC-130 gunship in the vicinity fired on "" six individual locations that were spread over many kilometres . ""
Earlier , US officials claimed that a US ground patrol believed it was being targeted by automatic weapons .
The patrol commander allegedly called in air support and the aircraft then came under sustained fire . ""
Normally when you think of celebratory fire , which is something that is not necessarily uncommon , it 's random , it 's sprayed .
It 's not directed at a specific target , "" a US military spokesman , Colonel Roger King , said .
"" In this instance the people on board the aircraft felt that the weapons were tracking them and that they were making a sustained effort to engage them . ""
A B-52 bomber and AC-130 gunship arrived on the scene and are reported to have mounted a sustained attack on the wedding party for almost two hours .
Central command acknowledged in a statement that attacks by B-52 and AC-130 aircraft "" may have resulted in civilian casualties "" .
US military officials had said yesterday one possible cause of the fatalities was a malfunctioning bomb from a B-52 bomber that was striking cave and bunker complexes in the vicinity .
But Gen Pace said tonight that an American soldier on the ground saw the bomb fall in an area where there were no people .
The Afghan foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , told journalists that the "" whole procedure "" for launching attacks "" should be reviewed to avoid such incidents "" .
Dr Abdullah said that four villages were attacked yesterday , killing 40 civilians and injuring about 100 .
He said the victims included all 25 members of one family . ""
This situation has to come to an end .
Mistakes can take place , human errors are possible , but our people should be assured that every measure was taken to avoid such incidents . ""
Dr Abdullah said the "" enemies of peace and stability in Afghanistan "" could exploit such accidents to drum up opposition against coalition forces and the Karzai government ."
2002-07-03,"US military officials in Afghanistan have refused to apologise following the mistaken bombing of an Afghan wedding party on Monday which killed at least 30 people , insisting that aircraft had come under sustained and hostile fire .
The incident prompted the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , to summon US military chiefs to his office and demand "" all necessary measures "" be taken "" not to harm innocent Afghan civilians "" .
Afghans claim the wedding guests , who were celebrating near Deh Rawud village , in the mountainous province of Oruzgan , north of Kandahar , had been firing into the air - a Pashtun wedding tradition - when American planes struck .
But a US spokesman claimed yesterday that the shooting was "" not consistent "" with a wedding , saying that the planes had come under attack . ""
Normally when you think of celebratory fire ... it 's random , it 's sprayed , it 's not directed at a specific target , "" said Colonel Roger King at the US airbase at Bagram .
"" In this instance , the people on board the aircraft felt that the weapons were tracking them and were [ trying ] to engage them . ""
The US planes - including a B-52 bomber and an AC-130 helicopter gunship - dropped seven 2,000 lb bombs , he added .
His unapologetic tone , after one of the worst blunders of the US - led coalition 's nine - month war in Afghanistan will infuriate locals , who said most of the dead were women and children .
At least 40 others were injured .
Last night a US soldier was shot in the foot as an American military convoy returning from the hospital in Kandahar where wedding party victims were being treated came under fire .
Col King said the wounded soldier was taken to the US base at Kandahar airport .
Afghans travelling with the convoy returned fire but it was not known if they hit any targets .
In Washington , the defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , said of the bombing that any loss of innocent lives was a tragedy , but said he would not know what had happened until the Afghan and US investigators had reported .
"" I read in the paper there was a wedding , "" Mr Rumsfeld said .
"" I just do n't know the facts . ""
US troops appear to have been carrying out a major search for Mullah Omar , the Taliban 's fugitive leader .
The Afghan foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , said that 40 people , all civilians , had died , and that a further 100 were wounded . ""
In one village , there was a wedding party ... a whole family of 25 people .
No single person was left alive .
This is the extent of the damage , "" he said .
Raaz Mohammad , an official at the Oruzgan governor 's office in the provincial capital , Tarin Kowt , also put the death toll as high as 40 .
The Pentagon has admitted that one of its bombs was "" errant "" and missed the target , but has refused to confirm that a missile hit the wedding party .
American confusion is compounded by the fact that it is unclear which plane was involved .
The Pentagon confirmed that a B-52 bomber did drop seven "" precision guided weapons "" on a cave complex , one of which missed the target .
But the US claims this hit an empty hillside .
That still leaves questions about the AC-130 gunship that returned what was claimed to be anti - aircraft fire .
Mr Rumsfeld said he knew of no casualties , other than four "" young people "" brought by their father to a US base , who were then helicoptered to Kandahar for treatment .
He did hint that al - Qaida training manuals gave advice on how to discredit the US in situations like this but added : "" I have no reason to believe that is the case this time . ""
Col King said the incident occurred during an operation to track down wanted Taliban or al - Qaida personnel , arms and documents .
He said : "" The US government extends its deepest sympathies to those who may have lost loved ones or who may have suffered any injuries .
Coalition military forces take extraordinary measures to protect against civilian casualties . ""
US forces killed 15 people in the same province in January in a firefight which they later admitted was "" ill - advised "" ."
2002-07-08,"Ironically , Haji Abdul Qadir , who has been assassinated at the apparent age of 48 , was reluctant to accept one of Afghanistan 's five vice - presidential posts in the government that President Hamid Karzai formed last month .
Already a prominent Pashtun , he did not want to give up his powerful position .
He had been governor of his mountainous home province of Nangarhar from 1992 to 1996 , and , after the fall of the Taliban last November , sped back to the regional capital Jalalabad to resume the post .
Pivotal in the relationship between the vital eastern province and Kabul , he was already urban development minister , following the formation of Afghanistan 's preceding interim adminstration .
Karzai 's policy has been to strengthen his central authority , and supposedly generate security and stability , by gathering powerful regional leaders in Kabul .
Elevating Qadir was also part of that complex process of providing ethnic balance within the government , after complaints from Pashtuns that they were being sidelined .
Qadir fitted Karzai 's bill .
Energetic , dynamic and moderate , he had been vice - chairman of the Northern Alliance delegation at the Bonn talks , sponsored by the United Nations last December , which established Afghanistan 's post - Taliban interim administration .
Unhappy about what he saw as inadequate Pashtun representation , Qadir briefly stormed out of those discussions ; but he returned and , indeed , became a minister while still retaining his hold on power in Nengarhar .
His vice - presidential app- ointment helped Karzai to win Pashtun support in the June loya jirga ( or great gathering ) of leaders and elders .
In the wake of his death , Karzai has not only lost a key ally in the centre but faces a potential power vacuum in the east .
Qadir was a veteran mojahedeen commander , and a controversial military and political figure .
A Pashtun from the Ahmadzai tribe , he belonged to one of the most influential , affluent and prominent families in the east of Afghanistan .
His involvement in Afghan politics predated the 1979 Soviet invasion but , during the ensuing war , he was a key commander with the Hezb- I - Islami ( Islamic party ) led by conservative cleric Younis Khalis .
It was after the fall of Dr Najibullah 's government in 1992 - the final legacy of the pro - Soviet era - that he was appointed governor of Nengarhar province .
But he was driven out of that power base when the fundamental ist Islamic Taliban began its relentless ascent to power after 1994 .
Qadir took refuge in neighbouring Pakistan in 1996 , but soon ran into trouble with the authorities because of his anti - Taliban stand and left for Germany .
For three years he shuttled between Dubai , where he ran a successful trading business , and Germany until he returned to Afghanistan to join the Tajik and Uzbek - dominated Northern Alliance , fighting the mainly Pashtun Taliban .
His presence in the alliance ensured its influence in the Pashtun east .
At a time when the Taliban had taken control of most of the country , Qadir was a vital figure .
Active on different fronts with the Northern Alliance , he was close to its Tajik leader Ahmad Shah Masood ( obituary September 17 2001 ) , whose murder , attributed to Al Qaeda , came two days before September 11 2001 .
The death of Qadir 's younger brother , the legendary rebel Abdul Haq ( obituary , October 29 2001 ) , followed soon afterwards .
Haq had secretly re - entered Afghanistan from northwest Pakistan .
He was involved in the campaign to topple the Taliban , and had agreed to try and whip up a rebellion in late October during the start of the US bombing campaign against Taliban and Al Qaeda .
He was been attempting to rally anti - Taliban support among the Pashtuns when he was captured by Taliban intelligence in the eastern region and hurriedly executed as US forces made an unsuccessful attempt to rescue him .
This coincided with another rebellion in the south led by Karzai , who was more fortunate in evading Taliban attempts to capture him .
Qadir is survived by his three wives and children .
His other brothers are still involved in Afghan politics . ·
Haji Abdul Qadir , politician , born circa 1954 ; died July 6 2002"
2002-07-08,"Thousands of mourners crowded into a graveyard in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad yesterday for the funeral of Haji Abdul Qadir , the Afghan vice - president shot at the weekend .
Wrapped in the green , red and black Afghan flag , the body of the senior Pashtun warlord was drawn on a gun carriage from Jalalabad 's White Mosque to the lush green Amir Shaheed gardens , where he was buried amid heavy security .
The murder of Qadir , the most senior Pashtun in government after the president , Hamid Karzai , is a huge blow to Mr Karzai and to foreign hopes that Afghanistan will be more stable under new government chosen last month .
The assassination prompted several US senators yesterday to call for a stronger role in Afghanistan for the international peacekeeping force .
Despite repeated calls for it to be deployed throughout the country , the Bush administration has insisted on it operating only in Kabul .
Senator Evan Bayh , a Democrat member of the intelligence committee , said it was time for the United States to commit more troops to secure Afghanistan beyond the capital , Kabul .
"" We went to war to clean this country out , and I do n't see why we should take half measures to try and stabilise it , to make sure it does n't become a protectorate for terrorists once again , "" he said .
"" We are running a real risk that the gains we made during the war could be lost by an insufficient peace . ""
Senator Chuck Hagel , a Republican on the foreign relations committee , said : "" I fear that we may see this government and our efforts unwind here if we do n't make the appropriate investment of men and effort and resources . ""
"" If we lose there , if this goes backward , this will be a huge defeat for us symbolically in that region , in the world ...
We can not allow this to go down ..
Bob Graham , chairman of the intelligence committee , described the murder as "" definitely a throwback to the old Afghanistan and a setback to the establishment of the new Afghanistan "" .
He too suggested that troops from outside Afghanistan should play a bigger role .
As vice - president and minister of public works , Qadir was important to President Karzai in creating a stronger Pashtun element in the government to balance Tajik control of the defence and foreign ministries .
His appointment was also an effort to get warlords out of their regional fiefdoms .
Two other warlords , Ismail Khan in Herat , and Abdul Rashid Dostum in Mazar - i - Sharif , refused offers of ministries for fear of losing control of their bases .
Qadir 's killing is likely to reinforce their view that they are safer in their regions than in Kabul .
Many people may have had motives to assassinate Qadir , from Tajik leaders to Taliban holdouts who want to destabilise Mr Karzai .
His murder , the second of a Pashtun minister in five months , shows how fragile the peace is .
But the killing may have been part of a criminal feud .
After years spent establishing his leadership in the opium and smuggling den of Jalalabad , Qadir had earned more enemies than friends .
Of all Afghanistan 's warlords , he was perhaps the most elegant .
When he returned to Jalalabad in November , a day after the Taliban fled the city , he appeared a princely figure gathering hundreds of supplicants around him as he shared out the positions of power in the east .
But his apparent charm belied a darker past .
During the jihad of the 80s he fought as a commander with the Hezb - e - Islami , the most extreme and brutal of all the mojahedin factions .
In the early 90s he reaped the benefits of victory by encouraging poppy production and overseeing a flourishing smuggling trade along the Pakistani border .
It was Qadir who , in 1996 , welcomed Osama bin Laden into Afghanistan and allowed him to stay in the Farmhadda housing complex just outside Jalalabad .
Only when the Taliban emerged did Qadir flee Jalalabad and give his tentative support to the Tajik - dominated Northern Alliance .
Qadir 's younger brother , Abdul Haq , was killed last October after he crossed into Afghanistan to stir up a rebellion against the Taliban .
The Americans gave Haq strong support , seeing him as the best candidate to lead the country .
They turned to Mr Karzai after he died .
Although officials have not suggested any motive for Qadir 's murder or named any suspects , the police arrested all 10 security guards at the ministry for failing to prevent the attack or apprehend the gunmen , who sped off in a waiting car .
Mr Karzai has set appointed a team of five , headed by another vice - president , Karim Khalili , to investigate Qadir 's murder ."
2002-07-21,"Britain and the United States are secretly distributing huge sums of money to persuade Afghan warlords not to rebel against their country 's new government .
The Observer has learnt that ' bin bags ' full of US dollars have been flown into Afghanistan , sometimes on RAF planes , to be given to key regional power brokers who could cause trouble for Prime Minister Hamid Karzai 's administration .
Gul Agha Sherzai , the governor of the southern province of Kandahar , Hazrat Ali , a commander in the eastern province of Nangahar , and several others have been ' bought off ' with millions of dollars in deals brokered by US and British intelligence .
Many of the commanders benefiting from the operation have been involved in opium production , drug smuggling on a massive scale and widespread human - rights abuses .
Without the hand - outs , Western intelligence agencies fear Afghanistan could collapse into anarchy , allowing Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaeda terrorist group and former Taliban elements to regroup .
Foreign Office sources in London confirmed last week they were aware money was being ' circulated ' to key Afghan warlords to persuade them to support the government . '
It is certainly true that money has been distributed - it is the way things work in this part of the world - but no British money [ is being distributed ] , ' the source said . '
In any case , you do not buy warlords in Afghanistan : you "" rent "" them for a period .
The Russians discovered this to their cost .
They would buy off a warlord and after a while he would come back and tell them : "" My men wo n't wear this arrangement any more .
You will have to give me more money , or we will have to go back to attacking you "" . '
However , The Observer has been told by reliable sources in Afghanistan and Pakistan that some UK money is being distributed , although most of it is American .
Relief workers in Afghanistan have criticised the hand - outs because they come when funds for emergency help and reconstruction projects in the war - damaged country are running low .
Cash for roadbuilding , irrigation and power projects is unlikely even to reach Afghanistan before 2003 , and only £ 3 billion of the estimated £ 10bn needed to rebuild the nation has so far been pledged .
Previous attempts to buy the loyalty of warlords have met mixed results .
During the battle of Tora Bora in April , local commanders were paid huge sums to send their own troops into the mountainous cave complexes where bin Laden was thought to be hiding .
The warlords involved in this operation , including Hazrat Ali , accuse each other of taking bribes from bin Laden to allow him to escape .
In Paktia province , the Americans paid Pacha Khan Zardran , a local commander who seized control of the eastern city of Khost last November , an estimated $ 400,000 to train and equip fighters to patrol the border with Pakistan .
Since then , however , the government in Kabul has installed its own governor and forced Khan into the mountains , from where his troops have been shelling civilian areas in a bid to destabilise the new regime . '
You are playing with fire and pandering to the worst elements in Afghan culture and society , ' said one Pakistan - based Western diplomat . '
Afghanistan would be better served by expanding peacekeeping forces or more aid for ordinary people . '
Many Afghans in Khost blame the rising tension on the US .
Paying the warlords for their services has triggered clashes among groups eager to win patronage from the Americans .
In some areas commanders have been told they will receive a top - of - the - range $ 40,000 pick - up truck - a local status symbol - if they can prove they have killed Taliban or al - Qaeda elements .
There are believed to be about 300 hardcore al - Qaeda fighters still active , almost all in western Pakistan .
Bin Laden , whom most Afghan , Pakistani and Western intelligence sources believe is still alive , is thought to be hiding among the Pashtun tribes along the border ."
2002-08-13,"Mohammad Khatami , in the first visit by an Iranian head of state to Afghanistan in 40 years , today promised a new relationship and $ 500 m ( £ 327 m ) in reconstruction aid to a country whose stability he said was essential for Iran and the region .
The Iranian president was holding talks with Hamid Karzai , his Afghan counterpart , about mutual problems such as stemming the flow of opium from Afghanistan into Iran .
In a joint press conference with Mr Karzai , Mr Khatami said Iran has offered 2,000 university scholarships to Afghan students .
He also said efforts were under way to boost trade between the two countries and that Iran was rebuilding the highway between Herat and the Iranian border . ""
The international community should accept responsibility for helping the government to start rebuilding and to bring stability to this country , "" Mr Khatami said .
"" The presence of other countries in Afghanistan can only be acceptable if they help the country and the government to rebuild and to bring about peace here . ""
The high - level visit and the promise of aid underscore Iran 's interest in reaching out to neighbouring Afghanistan , which shares close ties of language , culture and the Islamic faith , at a time when Afghanistan 's government is heavily dependent on the US for its survival .
Iran , which had opposed the hardline Islamist rule of the Taliban and supported US efforts to remove them , has sheltered hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees .
Mr Khatami also lashed out at the US for its accusations that Iran was part of an "" axis of evil "" that harboured terrorists .
He confirmed today that his government has been handing over detainees to other countries on the slightest suspicion of al - Qaida terrorist involvement , and in particular has deported al - Qaida suspects to Saudi Arabia .
"" We have longer experience than the Americans in fighting terrorism , "" he told reporters .
All the world 's nations should come together under the United Nations to fight terror , he said , adding , in a reference to the US : "" Fighting terrorism should not mean imposing the will of one country unilaterally on other countries of the world . ""
Since the US war on the Taliban and their al - Qaida terrorist allies in Afghanistan last autumn , some US officials have accused Iran of allowing al - Qaida members to escape to safety through its territory .
But Saudi Arabian officials now say Iran has handed over 16 suspected al - Qaida fighters .
"" Even if we had just a little suspicion , we delivered them to their countries , and not just Saudi Arabia , "" Mr Khatami said .
Without making specific mention of US threats to force out the Iraqi president , Saddam Hussein , Mr Khatami said : "" No doubt attacking one state in the world affects other states .
Today , we know that aggression brings aggression and to believe that you can make people submit by force is wrong .
We know it actually brings anger and destruction . ""
"" Those with power have more responsibility to bring peace in the world , "" Mr Khatami added .
Mr Karzai , whose government depends heavily on the US for its very survival , was careful to avoid taking sides .
"" We are grateful to Iran for accepting our refugees and we thank America for its help in fighting the terrorists and for its help in establishing the transitional government , "" Mr Karzai said .
Mr Khatami was welcomed at Kabul airport by Mr Karzai , who rode with his Iranian guest to the presidential palace under heavy American and Iranian security .
The two leaders were accompanied by Herat warlord Ismail Khan , whose close ties to Iran have worried both Mr Karzai and his American backers .
"" We have no intention of interfering in this country , "" Mr Khatami said today .
"" No country should interfere in this country because the people of Afghanistan would never tolerate that . """
2002-08-14,"The Iranian president , Mohammad Khatami , visiting Afghanistan for the first time , said yesterday that his government had been handing people over to other countries on the slightest suspicion of their being involved in al - Qaida .
Confirming reports that Iran had deported al - Qaida suspects to Saudi Arabia , he rejected US criticism that it had not done enough in the war on terror .
"" We have longer experience than the Americans in fighting terrorism , "" he told a joint news conference with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , adding : "" Fighting terrorism should not mean imposing the will of one country unilaterally on other countries of the world . ""
His visit is the first by an Iranian head of state to Afghanistan for 40 years .
He is offering a $ 500 m aid package and seeking a greater Afghan effort to stop opium production and trafficking .
US officials have accused Iran of letting al - Qaida members escape to safety through its territory , but Saudi officials say Iran has handed over 16 suspected al - Qaida fighters to Saudi Arabia at its request . ""
Even if we had just a little suspicion , we delivered them to their countries , and not just Saudi Arabia , ""
Mr Khatami told reporters .
He added : "" The American administration has a misunderstanding about their own power and their own interests . ""
Since September 11 this administration has taken an angry approach to foreign policy . ""
He did not give specific examples . ""
No doubt attacking one state in the world affects other states , "" he said .
"" Today we know that aggression brings aggression , and to believe that you can make people submit by force is wrong .
We know it actually brings anger and destruction . ""
President Karzai was careful to avoid taking sides .
"" We are grateful to Iran for accepting our refugees and we thank America for their help in fighting the terrorists , for help in establishing the transitional government , "" he said .
Mr Khatami was welcomed at Kabul airport by Mr Karzai and accompanied to the presidential palace , under heavy security , by the Afghan Herat warlord Ismail Khan , whose close relations with Iran have worried Mr Karzai and his US backers .
He told the press conference that Iran had offered 2,000 university scholarships to Afghan students , that efforts were being made to increase trade , and that Iran was rebuilding the road between Herat and the Iranian border . ""
The international community should accept responsibility to help the government to start rebuilding and bring stability to this country , "" he said .
"" The presence of other countries in this country can only be acceptable if they help the country and the government to rebuild and bring about peace in Afghanistan . ""
Mr Khatami 's entourage included Iranian police officers who planned discussions on stemming opium production and trafficking .
The visit and aid underscore Iran 's interest in reaching out to Afghanistan , closely related in language , Islamic faith and culture , when its government is heavily dependent on the US .
Iran sheltered hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees during the Taliban years , publicly endorsed the US - led fight against the Taliban and al - Qaida , and cooperated with Washington in trying to stop the movement of narcotics from Afghanistan .
But it remains part of President George Bush 's "" axis of evil "" , and earlier this year the US accused Tehran of interfering in Afghan affairs and trying to undermine the Karzai government .
"" We have no intention of interfering in this country , "" Mr Khatami said .

2002-09-05,"A lone assassin today attempted to kill Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , in one of the most volatile days the country has seen since the Taliban was deposed at the end of last year .
The assassination attempt came on the same day that a car bomb killed at least 15 people in the Afghan capital , Kabul .
According to witnesses , one of the president 's own security guards fired at his car as it was leaving the governor 's mansion in Kandahar , where Mr Karzai was attending a wedding celebration for his youngest brother .
US special forces guarding Mr Karzai screamed for him to take cover and opened fire on his attacker as the convoy sped away .
The Kandahar governor , Gul Agha Sherzai , was injured and three people were killed in the gunfire .
"" I was just outside the gate when I heard the gunshots , "" Mr Sherzai 's security chief , Dur Mohammed , said .
"" The Americans opened fire on three people and they were killed . ""
A car bomb in Kabul this morning killed at least 15 people , and possibly many more , at a city market near the ministries of information and education .
It was the most serious in a string of bombings that have hit Kabul since August 15 when a small blast shattered windows at the ministry of telecommunications .
Previous bombings have been small , causing few casualties and relatively little damage .
Residents said the explosion was the worst in Kabul since the Mr Karzai came to power .
"" It was a very , very strong explosion .
We ca n't say exactly who was behind it
but we know the last bombs were al - Qaida and [ former prime minister ]
Gulbuddin [ Hekmatyar ] , "" a police spokesman , Dul Aqa , said .
Mr Hekmatyar issued a call for jihad , or holy war , this week to drive US and foreign troops including international peacekeepers from Afghanistan .
A smaller explosion appears to have drawn crowds to the area when the car bomb exploded in front of a building containing shops selling televisions and satellite dishes - all forbidden during Taliban rule .
The second floor of the building housed a small hotel .
One shopper , Haji Abdul Aroof , said he saw four bodies lying in the street .
"" We came to see what was happening when the second bomb went off , "" he said .
"" There was a powerful explosion and we all ran . ""
Police said more than 20 had been injured in addition to the dead .
Mr Karzai 's administration has been violently attacked on several occasions since it took power .
Abdul Rahman , the minister for air transport and tourism , was beaten to death at Kabul airport in February and one of three vice - presidents , Haji Abdul Qadir , was assassinated in Kabul in July ."
2002-09-06,"The Afghan authorities today questioned six men in connection with an assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai and a car bomb in Kabul that killed at least 22 people .
Yesterday 's attacks were the most serious challenge yet to Mr Karzai 's government , which is struggling to establish stability in a country divided among feuding warlords and left in financial ruins by decades of bloodshed .
The would - be assassin , dressed in a security force uniform , emerged from the crowd greeting Mr Karzai and fired on the president 's car .
Mr Karzai 's US bodyguards killed the gunman and two other men , both carrying weapons .
An official in Kandahar city in the south told the Reuters news agency that the suspects had been picked up outside the residence of Kandahar governor , Gul Agha Sherzai , shortly after the gunman had opened fire .
Police said that a further two suspects had been detained for questioning after they were linked to the taxi concealing the huge explosive device that detonated in a congested market area around the information ministry .
Afghan police and soldiers armed with assault rifles erected roadblocks all across Kabul .
They stopped cars and taxis , peering into back seats and car boots to look for explosives or anything deemed suspicious .
Many streets were blocked off altogether with troops waving back lines of traffic .
Kandahar residents expressed anger and dismay over the assassination attempt .
"" We condemn this action .
If we lose Karzai or the governor , this would be a terrible thing for Afghanistan .
We would go back to war , "" said Abdul Wali Wafa , 28 , who runs a fabric shop on the same street as the governor 's palace .
Others said they continued to fear attacks by anti - government forces .
"" If [ the president ] had died , our nation would face a huge loss , "" said 42-year - old teacher Ali Ahmed Fazali .
"" We have no one who unites this country except Karzai . """
2002-09-06,"Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , survived a serious assassination attempt last night thanks to his American bodyguards , hours after a car bomb exploded in a busy market in Kabul , killing at least 22 people and injuring dozens .
Mr Karzai 's American bodyguards stepped in to protect him when an Afghan security guard opened fire on his car during a visit to the southern city of Kandahar .
The US troops shot dead three men and one American special forces soldier was wounded .
Through a spokeswoman , President George Bush expressed relief that Mr Karzai had survived , but the attack and the bomb blast deepened nervousness in Washington over how much the US - led "" war on terror "" has achieved in the year since the September 11 attacks .
While Osama bin Laden and most of the al - Qaida leadership are still at large or unaccounted for , Mr Karzai 's government was its proudest achievement , but it looked less secure than ever yesterday .
The continuing violence , the most serious challenge to the Kabul government since it was installed in December , also seemed likely to add to the apprehension of US generals about starting a new war in Iraq while the old one is not over .
It is not clear if the two incidents yesterday were linked .
Mr Karzai was in the southern city of Kandahar , once the headquarters of the Taliban , on a rare visit outside Kabul to attend the wedding of his younger brother Ahmed Wali .
As the Afghan president left the mansion of the Kandahar governor , a security guard fired at least two rounds into his car .
Although Mr Karzai was unhurt , the governor , Gul Agha Sherzai , was injured and appeared to be bleeding from the neck .
However , Mr Sherzai was released from a US military hospital late last night .
The Afghan president 's heavily armed bodyguards shouted to Mr Karzai to take cover and opened fire on the attackers , killing three people .
BBC reporter Lyse Doucet was with the president at the time of the attack .
She said thousands of people were pressing forward toward Mr Karzai and one Afghan boy approached his vehicle .
As Mr Karzai leaned out to shake hands with the boy "" an Afghan in uniform also came forward and fired two rounds into the president 's vehicle "" .
Mr Karzai was rushed to the airport on the outskirts of the city and flown out .
Hours before the assassination attempt a powerful bomb blast struck a market near the ministry of informa tion in Kabul .
Witnesses said they first saw a small explosion on a bicycle .
As a crowd gathered it was followed minutes later by a much larger blast from a bomb which appeared to be planted in a taxi .
The scene was chaotic .
Pieces of flesh , sandals and clothing littered the road .
The deputy police chief , Mohammed Khalil , blamed al - Qaida , the Taliban and the former prime minister and exiled former guerrilla chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
"" This bomb was inside a taxi .
It was a very , very strong explosion , "" said Dul Aqa , a Kabul police spokesman .
"" We ca n't say exactly who was behind it
but we know the last bombs were al - Qaida and Gulbuddin . ""
Armoured personnel carriers and emergency vehicles with foreign troops from the International Security Assistance Force surrounded the site as ambulances ferried at least 65 injured to hospital .
A small contingent of US troops also inspected the site as Afghan police and soldiers cordoned off several roads and began checking passing cars .
Police believe the first bomb was intended to gather a large crowd before the second device exploded .
Haji Abdul Aroof , who was shopping in the market , said : "" We came to see what was happening when the second bomb went off .
There was a powerful explosion and we all ran .
"" Most of the injured were being treated at the Emergency Hospital and the government Wazir Akbar Khan hospital .
Since mid - August there have been seven small bombings in Kabul , the latest on Sunday when one Afghan was killed and three people , including a British soldier , were hurt .
· The Arabic television station al - Jazeera said yesterday that it had confessions from two alleged members of al - Qaida , claiming the group was responsible for the September 11 attacks .
An al - Jazeera official said the men , identified as Ramzi bin al - Shaibah and Khaled al - Sheikh Mohammad , had been former room - mates of Mohamed Atta , one of the 19 hijackers of the aircraft .

2002-09-06,"Nine months after the Taliban regime collapsed under the weight of US bombing , security across Afghanistan appears as fragile as ever .
Last night 's assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai and the devastating bomb blast in Kabul hours earlier reveal a country still struggling with the legacy of two decades of war .
The two attacks , the most serious challenge to Mr Karzai 's regime since it was installed in December , came despite the presence of the 4,000-strong International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) and after intensive efforts to pacify the country 's feuding warlords and hunt down the remains of al - Qaida and the Taliban .
Promises of peace in the new Afghanistan began to unravel in July when Haji Abdul Qadir , one of the new vice - presidents , was shot dead outside his Kabul office .
Most Afghans presumed the capital , with its contingent of 4,000 foreign troops , was the safest place in the country .
The city had filled with foreign diplomats and aid workers and dozens of restaurants and guest houses had opened .
But the apparent prosperity belied a continuing and elusive security threat .
Within days Mr Karzai had replaced his Afghan bodyguards with a team of 46 US special forces troops .
Many senior Afghans criticised him for the move , fearing it made him look like a puppet of Washington .
Yesterday , however , Mr Karzai appeared to have been proven wise .
His US bodyguards opened fire on a gunman attacking the president 's car .
In the past month there have been a number of small bomb attacks , mostly in Kabul .
An earlier bomb exploded outside the UN guesthouse , where most UN diplomats stay .
No one was injured in that attack .
With the limited scientific expertise available , it is not clear whether the bombings are the work of the Taliban or al - Qaida loyalists but both groups have been circulating leaflets threatening attacks , particularly against foreign troops .
Another threat comes from a former prime minister , the Islamist mojahedin warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
Earlier this week Mr Hekmatyar , who has been hunted by US troops for months , sent a taped message to a Pakistani newspaper calling on Afghans to force out western troops and to replace Mr Karzai .
"" How can we expect his regime to restore peace and offer security to the people ? "" he asked .
"" The US is sowing the seeds of another civil war that could even divide Afghanistan . ""
He insisted his group , Hezb - i - Islami , was not linked with the Taliban or al - Qaida , a charge being made by the government and by the new Turkish Isaf commander , General Hilmi Akin Zorlu .
Mr Hekmatyar has been in hiding since leaving his base in Tehran several months ago , where he lived while the Taliban were in power .
Mr Karzai 's government has used the bomb attacks to argue that US troops need to remain heavily engaged in Afghanistan and in the hunt for Bin Laden 's fighters .
"" What is this evidence of ?
What does that show ?
It is evidence of the fact that the campaign against terror should continue , "" the Afghan foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah said earlier this week .
Isaf officers have been preparing for an increase in attacks as the anniversary of September 11 approaches but had said it was unclear if these bombings were part of a coordinated plan .
On Tuesday Isaf troops and sniffer dogs searched the German embassy as a precaution against possible attacks .
Western governments have been largely reluctant to expand the role of Isaf to cover other cities .
Instead they have preferred to try and build a national army despite the fact that Afghanistan is a nation of feuding ethnic groups .
Less than 1,000 soldiers have so far completed their training .
Yesterday Paul Wolfowitz , the US deputy defence secretary , for the first time appeared to offer an alternative security formula when he raised the idea that Isaf 's role could be expanded .
"" We are also considering the possibility that Isaf could play a role outside the capital if it could be enlarged , "" he told a meeting at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Wash- ington .
But he made it clear the US would not take a lead role in expanding the force ."

AL - QAIDA BLAMED FOR AFGHANISTAN ATTACKS
An assassination attempt on the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , and a bomb attack in the capital , Kabul , that left 15 people dead has again focused attention on the country almost a year on from the September 11 attacks .
For the Mirror it is the "" day the war on terror blew up in its face "" .
It quotes a Kabul security officer , Haqela Hazizy , who says Osama bin Laden is responsible for the attacks ( as do other Afghan officials ) : "" This is al - Qaida .
They 're telling the world they 're back . ""
The would - be assassin - a security guard - opened fire on Mr Karzai 's car as it pulled out of the governor 's mansion in Kandahar , but missed the president by no more than a couple of inches .
The Kabul bomber achieved more success - widely reprinted photographs show the devastation in the city .
The FT says the incidents "" may demonstrate the resilience of the Islamists ' terrorism network in Afghanistan , "" adding that they have prompted speculation "" that a fresh campaign was beginning a week before the anniversary of the al - Qaida attacks on the US "" .
Ahmed Rashid writes in the Telegraph that "" Kabul 's bloodiest day since the defeat of the Taliban "" is more than just the build - up by extremists to September 11 but evidence that Afghanistan is on the verge of unravelling .
He says the west needs to send more international peacekeepers to stabilise the country and speed up funds for its promised reconstruction but warns the fact that it 's too late for a "" US policy shift that should have occurred months ago "" may only have hit home yesterday .

2002-09-07,"Afghan police yesterday began questioning two suspects in the wake of the assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai and a devastating car bomb in Kabul which left 26 people dead .
It is still unclear whether the two attacks were connected .
Afghan officials blamed both on Taliban and al - Qaida loyalists .
Investigators in Kandahar named the man who tried to shoot the Afghan president as Abdur Rehman , who they said came from the Kajaki area of Helmand province , a known Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan .
Police said Rehman had been hired four days earlier as a guard at the Kandahar governor 's mansion .
As Mr Karzai left the mansion on Thursday afternoon Rehman , who was dressed in a military uniform , stepped out of the crowd and fired four rounds into his car , narrowly missing the president .
US special forces troops , who have been guarding the president since July , leapt from their four - wheel drive vehicle and shot Rehman dead .
An Afghan bodyguard and an armed bystander were also killed in a brief gun battle .
It became clear yesterday how narrowly the Afghan president had survived the attack .
One bullet hit the back of Mr Karzai 's seat , another smashed the window by his side .
Gul Agha Sherzai , the Kandahar governor , was sitting next to Mr Karzai and was slightly wounded in the neck .
An Afghan bodyguard was also wounded .
"" It is premature to say anything about who was behind this attack but terrorist elements are still bent upon killing Afghan leaders , "" Mr Sherzai said yesterday .
Khalid Pashtoon , the Kandahar governor 's spokesman , said the gunman had started guarding the entrance to the mansion only four days earlier .
"" The people guarding this place were hired to protect the palace , not us .
Maybe it 's our big mistake , "" he said .
Mr Karzai himself appeared remarkably unruffled by the assassination attempt .
"" I am safe and sound .
I am fine , "" he told the BBC minutes after the attack .
"" I expect things like that to come across the way .
I 've been threatened before . ""
He flew back to Kabul early yesterday morning for a meeting with the Russian defence minister , Sergei Ivanov , to discuss support for the fledging Afghan army .
It was the first visit by a Russian defence minister since Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 after a 10-year war .
In Kabul police arrested a taxi driver who owned the car used in the bombing in a crowded market hours before the assassination attempt .
Taj Mohammad Wardak , the interior minister , said the driver , an Afghan , had provided little information . ""
He has not said anything yet to indicate that he had any link with the explosions , "" he said .
Witnesses said a crowd gathered at the market area after a small blast on a bicycle on Thursday afternoon .
Minutes later the car bomb exploded .
Commander Simon Ryan , a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) , a contingent of 4,000 foreign troops patrolling Kabul , said 26 people were believed to have died in the bombing .
Another 150 people were wounded .
An extra 800 Afghan soldiers were deployed across Kabul , stopping and searching cars at checkpoints .
The Afghan government said the two attacks reinforced the continued need for foreign troops in Afghanistan .
"" I think on one side it is destabilising the situation in Afghanistan , "" said Abdullah Abdullah , the foreign minister .
"" It is further evidence that the war against terror in Afghanistan is far from over . """
2002-09-07,"Hamid Karzai is a man with a lot of enemies .
They include adherents of the Taliban regime he helped depose last year , fellow Pashtuns who oppose his Tajik - dominated transitional government , anti - American renegades such as former prime minister and mojahedin leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , and a host of other malcontents .
Any one of them may have been behind the latest attempt to assassinate Mr Karzai in Kandahar and an almost simultaneous car bombing in Kabul .
But most likely , as suggested by the Afghan foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah , the culprits were members of al - Qaida or its local offshoots .
This is no great surprise .
Last autumn 's US - led military action dispersed al - Qaida but sadly failed to destroy it .
For whatever reason , Osama bin Laden has disappeared and al - Qaida has signally failed so far to mount the feared follow - up to September 11 .
But it has not been defanged , as shown by the actual or thwarted attacks in North Africa and Italy this year .
Its support base in the Muslim world may actually have expanded as anti - American sentiment , particularly over Palestine , has grown .
And its finances remain considerable .
According to a UN report , "" al - Qaida is by all accounts ' fit and well ' and poised to strike again at its leisure "" .
From Europe too comes evidence that al - Qaida 's comeback has commenced .
In Britain , MI5 keeps silent watch over sleepers .
In Germany , anti - terror chief Manfred Klink warns that "" the network is fundamentally ready for action "" .
But the focal point of this reviving activity is to be found , as prior to September 11 , along the Kabul - Karachi axis .
Here in recent months al - Qaida 's hand has been detected in a gradually accelerating series of direct or proxy attacks inside both Afghanistan and Pakistan .
An attempt to assassinate Pakistan 's leader , Pervez Musharraf , was foiled but western civilians and Christian churchgoers have not been as lucky as he and Mr Karzai .
Clearly , lest the same mistake be repeated , these stirrings along the faultlines of al - Qaida terror must be stifled before they again reach out to strike across the world .
To this end , the US should spend less time abusing Iraq and far more underwriting long - term Afghan and Pakistani security and democracy .
That in part means expanded multinational peacekeeping , much more aid , and an all - out attempt at nation - building in both these most unstable of states ."
2002-09-11,"I was travelling in Swat , northern Pakistan , on September 11 .
The moment I heard the news I rushed to the TV
and I just could n't believe it .
Immediately I called my friend Hamid Karzai [ now the Afghan president ] , but I did n't realise how much would change in Afghanistan .
From that moment we did n't stop working .
I left Afghanistan in 1979 and sought refuge in Pakistan and then in Australia .
I was involved in Afghan politics for many years and I took part in many of the peace process negotiations .
In 1992 I was a minister counsellor here in Islamabad for the Afghan government , but within one year , when it descended into fighting between mojahedin warlords , I left and I did n't see Kabul until last year .
After the Taliban left Kabul in November , I went back .
One side of me was crying and the other side was so very happy .
I felt like a man who had just been released from prison .
I was looking everywhere , trying to take everything in .
I went to the Darul Aman palace , but there was no palace there .
I went to the school where I studied as a child and I went back to my university .
It was a feeling of tragedy and happiness at the same time .
I could n't believe how much of the city had been destroyed .
One would imagine the military bases had been damaged , but it was more than that .
Private houses , roads , parks , schools , hospitals , and colleges were all destroyed .
I was astonished at the destruction I saw .
When I was living in Kabul as a young man it was a beautiful place .
At this time of year it would be crowded with tourists .
We now have a huge task ahead of us to build this country again .
Afghanistan can not be rebuilt in a day .
I am very optimistic .
But I know there are problems - you can not expect miracles .
This time I believe that Afghanistan has really changed .
The world has got to be patient and we must work very hard .
A huge number of Afghan refugees have gone home
and I hope more will follow , especially the businessmen .
They are a little worried about the security , but they know they can make big money if they return home now .
Lots of Afghans are realising they can contribute to the development of their country .
When we have elections in 18 months time I too would like to go back and take a seat in the parliament .
We have to end this ethnic division .
An Afghan is an Afghan and this is what we must learn .
We have got many languages , but we are a sovereign country .
We must work for the rehabilitation of our country .
Afghans are fed up with fighting - we are a peaceful people .
For the past 23 years there has been war and fighting imposed on Afghans .
We know now that war means nothing except destruction .

2002-10-01,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has used a tour of Gulf Arab states to reiterate his call for international aid to help the reconstruction of Afghanistan after 23 years of civil war and foreign military intervention .
At a news conference following talks in Qatar on Sunday , the Afghan foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , described foreign aid to his country as "" slow and insufficient "" . ""
The Afghan minister voiced disappointment because promises of generous aid by donor countries to his country and its reconstruction effort were not fulfilled and said his country did not receive about half of the pledged aid , "" the official Qatari News Agency said .
Mr Karzai is seeking the speedy delivery of more than $ 4bn ( £ 2.6bn ) in foreign donations pledged by several countries , including the Gulf Arab states , at a meeting in Tokyo in January .
So far Afghanistan has received only about $ 40 m , with a further $ 50 m in promises , according to the UN .
Many Afghans are facing severe poverty and poor health as a result of malnutrition and disease .
Mr Karzai 's Gulf tour included talks with the United Arab Emirates - which has pledged up to $ 36 m , but has yet to provide the funds , according to diplomats - and Saudi Arabia .

2002-11-08,"Even as the first bombs rained down on Afghanistan just over a year ago , George Bush and Tony Blair promised a double campaign in the country .
Military might would be matched by humanitarian and security assistance for the millions of Afghans left destitute by Taliban rule and US bombs .
As the TV and newspaper images show , the capital Kabul is enjoying new freedoms :
music plays in the streets , locals play football with peacekeepers , and the interim administration , led by Hamid Karzai , is enjoying local and international support .
But outside of the capital , as aid agencies and human rights observers have confirmed , the picture is very different .
Kabul may be engulfed in post - Taliban delight , but to the north and the west of Afghanistan , where international peacekeeping is not extended , Taliban rule has been quickly replaced by infighting between rival ethnic warlords .
Human rights abuses and political repression are rife .
During the summer , aid agency workers trying to provide food and medicine to the destitute , were regularly caught in the crossfire between warring factions .
They faced robbery , rape and even murder .
The refusal of the international community to expand the International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) peacekeeping mission to outside of Kabul , or to find an alternative , has created a desperate human rights and security vacuum .
A report published this week by the New York - based Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) catalogues the lawlessness that has engulfed the western province of Herat . ""
The international community says it wants to reduce the power of the warlords , "" said John Sifton , HRW researcher and author of the report .
"" But in Herat , it has done exactly the opposite . ""
The police , security and intelligence forces in Herat are all former mujahedin fighters , led by tribal warlord Ismail Khan , now governor of the province .
Using US weapons and support , Khan rules using his traditional methods of violence , intimidation , political repression and murder .
The report relates numerous cases of arbitrary arrest and torture , as well as the random repression of minority Pashtuns . ""
Then the man said , ' now I will make him do the death dance ' .
And they [ electric ] shocked him again .
And he said he was moving all about and shaking all about by his feet .
He was still hanging upside down from the ceiling , "" one prisoner relates .
A local humanitarian worker reveals several cases involving children , reportedly tortured by police , who shaved the youngster 's hair and paraded them on television .
"" Torture is a regular thing here - there in the prison , there are many cases , "" he was told .
According to the HRW report , a climate of fear now prevails in Herat , with people afraid to challenge the government .
Journalists are threatened and arrested , civil society groups are too scared to meet .
Women enjoy slightly more freedoms than under the Taliban , but are still banned from working , talking with men in public or moving freely in the province .
Ethnic Pashtuns have been especially targeted for military and police brutality , the report continues , suffering regular arrest and beatings .
In September , it says , police seized a human rights observer and the Pashtun he was interviewing .
Both were taken to Herat 's ministry of foreign affairs for interrogation .
In the north of Afghanistan , especially around Mazar - i - Sharif , aid workers reportedly found it impossible to provide much - needed assistance during the summer .
A document circulated among aid agencies working in the north revealed scores of attacks on aid workers and robberies of aid convoys .
In April , an Afghan worker for the Food and Agriculture Organisation was taken from his home and shot dead .
An international aid agency office was broken into in Mazar city in June .
Four armed men are reported to have bound and gagged workers there , before stealing thousands of dollars and a computer .
Later that month , according to HRW , a woman aid worker was brutally gang raped , and her driver severely beaten , while travelling in a clearly marked NGO vehicle between the northern cities of Khulm and Mazar .
NGOs have been forced to pay a "" tax "" to local warlords to get aid through , trucks have been stopped and tonnes of western donated food stolen .
Most aid agency staff were "" under constant threat and intimidation of local authorities and commanders "" , the report says .
At least 10 agencies have pulled out of the country completely , no longer able to guarantee the security of their staff .
Those that remained have , at times , imposed night time curfews and banned women workers from leaving protected compounds .
"" Attacks seemed to have laid off for the time being , but fighting between the tribes continues .
The security situation in the north is still very serious , "" said Peter Marsden , of the umbrella group British Agencies in Afghanistan .
Human Rights Watch has called for the extension of peacekeeping forces to the west of the country , to prevent human rights abuses .
More than 60 aid agencies , including Oxfam and Christian Aid , have written to the UN security council , as well as UK defence secretary , Geoff Hoon , urging the extension of Isaf .
Even the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , and his special advisor to Afghanistan , Lakhdar Brahimi , have called for an extension .
"" We continue to believe that the extension of Isaf would have an enormous impact on security , and could be achieved with relatively few troops , at relatively little cost , and with little danger , "" Mr Brahimi told the council .
Turkey , which has commanded Isaf for the last six months has been against expanding peacekeeping outside of the capital , mainly because the US wo n't commit any troops .
The UK 's personnel commitment amounts to just a few hundred .
Command will pass to Germany and the Netherlands in February , both more humanitarian - minded than Turkey , which is still banned from EU membership because of its own human rights situation .
Yet neither have pledged to support extend Isaf during their short six months in command .
The UK foreign office confirmed the UK does not support Isaf expansion .
A spokesperson said the main concern was to establish an Afghan army , security and police force which will bring long - term stability to the country .
But those measures are not expected to be fully in place until the 2004 elections .
Countries are already reluctant to take on command of Isaf , and expanding its remit would worsen that problem , a foreign office insider told me .
However , he did confirm that countries were aware of , and concerned about , the situation outside of Kabul .
They are currently engaged in "" international negotiations "" to find a solution .
International development secretary Clare Short went to exchange ideas with Afghan leaders last month .
One option being considered is to send international military and humanitarian teams into Afghan provinces .
Tony Blair has said the UK 's reputation rests on sticking with the people of Afghanistan .
"" We will stay there and make sure that the job is done properly because this is what we promised we would do , and we have got to keep that promise , "" he said after bombing started .
Unless the international community finishes what it started , and soon , any claim to have brought food and freedom to the people of Afghanistan will be revealed as a rewriting of history .

2002-11-21,"American forces in Afghanistan are embarking on a task that the Bush administration claimed its soldiers would never do - nation building - and moving resources from the hunt for al - Qaida to securing the countryside , Pentagon officials said yesterday .
The change is a tacit admission that the government of Hamid Karzai , installed with US support , remains incapable of imposing its will beyond the capital , Kabul .
It is the most significant policy shift towards a role the US had strenuously resisted .
"" There has not been an exact day of ' drop your guns and here is a shovel ' , but we are going through a new phase where it is less about combat , and more about stabilisation , "" a Pentagon spokesman said .
"" The efforts in this phase are 75 % reconstruction and humanitarian , and 25 % security and combat operations .
"" Three months ago , the proportions were roughly even , he said .
In part , the Pentagon 's public embrace of postwar reconstruction could be a reminder to Muslim countries that the US will not turn its back on Afghanistan in the event of an attack on Iraq .
But over time , US military officials have recognised that the survival of Mr Karzai 's government depends on bringing greater stability to the rest of the country .
"" This means that like it or not , the US is involved in state building in Afghanistan , "" said Barnett Rubin , an expert on Afghanistan at the Centre on International Cooperation at New York University .
"" The president said he was against it , but situations change . ""
US military officials have discovered that it is an exceedingly slow and painful process to weld a single Afghan army from the militias of competing warlords .
Meanwhile , there is also resistance from participating states to expanding the international security assistance force beyond Kabul .
Plans are under consideration for small clusters of US military officers to set up bases at Mazar - i - Sharif in northern Afghanistan and at Herat , in the west , for securing aid projects .
About 200 additional civilian affairs officers are to be involved .
US military personnel have also become involved in the small - scale provision of aid in medical clinics in rural areas of Afghanistan , as well as rebuilding culverts and bridges .
The largest reconstruction project - which is funded jointly with Japan and Saudi Arabia - got under way earlier this month when engineers arrived to rebuild the main route between Kabul and Kandahar .
However , some of these initiatives have antagonised the international aid community in Afghanistan , and there are also frictions with US Aid .
Some aid organisations are afraid they will be identified with the US military - and not viewed as independent actors - if soldiers become involved in providing medical care and other rehabilitation project .
Others in the aid community argue that direct US involvement in reconstruction will weaken Mr Karzai by making it more apparent that he is unable to deliver stability ."
2002-11-24,"He is the most vulnerable head of state in the world - Hamid Karzai , the President of Afghanistan .
Al - Qaeda would like to kill him .
Rival warlords want him dead .
In the internecine politics of Afghanistan , even some of his friends would probably like to see him out of the way .
Karzai survived an assassination attempt in the southern city of Kandahar in September when a gunman opened fire on his car .
That attack , one of a number on his life , was foiled by his United States military bodyguards .
But now the special forces men who saved Karzai 's life have been quietly replaced by security guards from one of America 's most controversial private military corporations , DynCorp .
On Friday the State Department confirmed the use of a private security detail managed by officers of its Diplomatic Security Service .
On the day it emerged that DynCorp had taken over most of the close protection duties for Karzai , the Vice - President and Defence Minister , Mohammad Qasim Fahim , survived an attempt on his life in Kabul by al - Qaeda .
According to Afghan security officers in Kabul yesterday , the original target of the assassination attempt had been Karzai .
Karzai 's absence until recently in the US scuppered that plan , and al - Qaeda had turned its attention to the Vice - President .
This revelation is certain to raise concern over security arrangements for key figures in Afghanistan 's fledgling government , including Karzai , whom President George Bush has vowed to support .
Officials at the State Department insisted to The Observer last week that Karzai would receive the same high level of protection from the Diplomatic Security Service - led detail - with its DynCorp security personnel .
DynCorp has been involved in a series of recent high - profile scandals .
A substantial financial backer of Bush 's election campaign , the company employs almost 25,000 staff , many of them former US military personnel , working in areas from security to aircraft maintenance .
While much of DynCorp 's work is of a non - controversial nature , it has become embroiled in a series of damaging allegations involving personnel in sensitive missions overseas .
DynCorp personnel contracted to the United Nations police service in Bosnia were implicated in buying and selling prostitutes , including a girl as young as 12 .
Several DynCorp employees were also accused of videotaping the rape of one of the women .
When a fellow DynCorp employee blew the whistle on the sex ring , she was dismissed by the company for drawing attention to their misbehaviour , according to the ruling of a British industrial tribunal earlier this year .
According to a recent article in New Republic magazine , DynCorp staff allegedly contracted to the CIA were involved in the accidental shooting down of a plane carrying US missionaries in Peru which had wrongly been identified as a drug smuggling aircraft .
In 2001 an employee of the company contracted to work on Plan Colombia , the drugs eradication plan instigated by President Bill Clinton , was accused of trying to smuggle a heroin derivative into the US , although the company insisted that it had carried out its own investigation and found no wrongdoing .
Critics of the increasingly widespread use by the Department of Defense and the State Department of private corporations such as DynCorp are most concerned about the lack of accountability of the privatised operations being conducted in support of US policy .
Defending the decision to remove Karzai 's special forces bodyguard , a spokesman for the Department of Defense said the decision to recall the US troops had been intended to take place around the time of the assassination attempt in September , but that the switchover had been put off because of the incident .
DynCorp refused to comment , telling The Observer it had been ' gagged ' over talking about the Afghan deal .
It was left to the State Department to offer a rationale . '
Responsibility for Mr Karzai 's security was handed over earlier this month to the Diplomatic Security Service , ' said an official , speaking anonymously . '
DynCorp personnel are involved in the detail that is being managed by the Diplomatic Security Service officials who have long experience in providing this kind of protection . '"
2002-11-30,"The British government is poised to expand its military involvement in Afghanistan by deploying troops in a town outside the capital , Kabul , for the first time , Whitehall sources revealed yesterday .
Mounting concern about the lack of government control over the countryside has prompted the US to ask allies to contribute troops to "" regional teams "" based in six large towns .
Washington has also been under growing pressure for help from the Afghan leader , Hamid Karzai , whose remit does not extend much beyond the capital .
According to one Whitehall source , Britain is actively considering the US request .
However another well - placed source said the decision has already been made and the deployment will begin in December .
The teams would be responsible for training local Afghan forces as well as undertaking security patrols .
They would also include staff from civil and humanitarian agencies .
"" We are looking at ways to help in parts of Afghanistan other than the capital , "" one Whitehall source said .
Defence sources are reluctant to comment on the issue , mainly because of serious concern among military chiefs of being overstretched , with troops covering for firefighters and preparing for deployment in the Gulf in the event of an attack onIraq .
But one of the Whitehall sources said the deployment had been approved at the highest levels as part of an effort to demonstrate that the west is serious about Afghanistan in the long - term : "" The Afghans have seen people come and go and are understandably wary . ""
On a visit to Bagram airbase north of Kabul yesterday , the US commander in charge of the overall ' war against terrorism ' , General Tommy Franks reinforced the message : "" While an awful lot has been done in Afghanistan , this is Afghanistan .
We 're just going to have to stay with it for as long as it takes ... to be sure that we do n't permit terrorism to retake Afghanistan . ""
Gen Franks refused to say whether the US mission was evolving into one of ' nation - building ' - a goal some US political and military leaders say is better left to the United Nations or other organisations .
He denied that the US - led war against Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaida network in Afghanistan was faltering .
It is believed that the US has asked Britain to command an international team based in Khost , south - eastern Afghanistan .
Britain has some 300 troops attached to the international security assistance force ( Isaf ) in Kabul .
Britain was the first leader of Isaf before handing over to Turkey .
A joint German - Dutch military command is due to take over from Turkey next month .
The expansion of the western military presence in Afghanistan will be discussed at a meeting near Bonn on Monday , celebrating the first year of Mr Karzai 's administration .
It will be attended by the foreign secretary , Jack Straw .
The meeting is primarily to mark this anniversary but announcements of fresh international donations are expected ."
2002-11-30,"The Lion 's Grave by Jon Lee Anderson
244pp , Atlantic , £ 7.99 The Sewing Circles of Herat by Christina Lamb 388pp , HarperCollins , £ 16.99 Jon Lee Anderson and Christina Lamb both set boot in Afghanistan in the 1980s before the Soviet withdrawal .
He had wars on the clock already but was not a dead - eyed veteran with a bottle of Jim Beam in the American Club in Peshawar ; she was young and fortune favoured her , since she was n't in the ambulance in her convoy that went up in a fireball , and was in a trench with the then unknown Hamid Karzai , hiding from Russian tanks and eating mudcrabs .
Which is to say that both these correspondents had long form between the rivers Oxus and Indus when they returned post - September 11 .
They had flattened places to go , people to see - sometimes the same people - even as bombs fell and factional misalliances coagulated into government .
Anderson went for the New Yorker , to file its style of dispatch , always so even - paced when set beside the hectic fragments on TV and front pages , and his book contains his collected essays .
He investigates the assassination of Ahmed Shah Massoud , lion of the Panjshir , moderate Islamist and defier of the Soviets and the Taliban , blown up by emissaries from al - Qaida .
He speaks with the witnesses and power - brokers suspected of betraying Massoud , he sleeps at the Massoud home , looking down on terraced apricot orchards , he watches in Kabul as Massoud 's image as national hero is paraded before a committee of warlords scheming over the loya jirga .
He is tenacious - many reporters would give up by the seventh account of double - dealing , the ninth interview with a liar , but Anderson includes them all , with their mendacity shrewdly interpreted .
His details are sparing of adjectives , in the tradition of US war - reporting back beyond Ernest Hemingway .
He delivers the requisite descriptions of faces , but notices hands and feet , too , especially in the best piece on Mullah Omar 's favourite songs - a succinct précis of hypocrisy in Kandahar , where warriors mince on sandals fashionably too small and high - heeled , and Taliban pose for snaps , so kohl - rimmed around the eyes they might be silent - movie stars .
But this mid - shot distance is sustainable only because he confines his real life - the logistics of filing - to exchanges of email with his office , which are here printed between essays .
In these his satellite communications crash , his money to hire safe escort runs out , his fellow hacks are ambushed by bandits , his hired - house toilets overflow .
He would probably consider it intrusive to print anything about his life up the sharp end in the finished work - as Tom Stoppard wrote , journos who 've been there know what it 's like and the readers do n't care - but his formal copy is therefore an uninflected narrative that implies more order , more politics in the debated - manifesto sense , than are present around Kandahar .
His perspective retains its focal point in mid - Manhattan .
Christina Lamb exited Afganistan more than a decade ago after not giving a wounded child help because she needed to get to the action , not at that time realising that young Lela , hit by a rocket among the wild crimson narcissi , was the action .
Lamb went back to report for the Telegraph this year , but she claims memoirist status in her book to keep the background where it should be , which is up close in the foreground .
She stresses her early turbanned time with the mojahedin to establish her hardness ( hacks ca n't risk foreign editors deriding them as soft ) , but overplays her regrets , her tenderness about her baby .
Then on page 79 she becomes the witness she would want to be , walking into all the right wrong places , beginning with the Haqqania seminary in the North - West Frontier province , thinktank of Taliban policy .
There she makes an important connection between the isolation of boys in such seminaries , and probable psycho - sexual abuse sanctioned by Pashtun custom , which left young Talibs silently angry , and converted them to priggish thugs who projected their frustration outwards as hatred of women .
Lamb has an access to both segregated sexes that is denied Anderson , and a curiosity that demands she listen to anyone - warlord , reluctant torturer , Pakistani intelligence officer acting as spokesman for fundamentalists , family of the last man hanged .
The context properly becomes her story , as when she visits the Afghan king 's court - in - exile in Rome - she describes him watching the bombs on CNN and waiting to pack his "" French novels , Hermès ties and old astrakhan hats in his new suitcases "" .
After unsuccessful searches of collapsed and compacted blocks of the Kabul suburb of Microrayon , she tracks down Marri , the English teacher who had smuggled out letters to her during the Taliban occupation , dangerous communications because Marri admitted to wearing red lipstick under the burkha and dreaming of dancing .
And beyond the door of the "" Golden Needle Ladies ' Sewing Classes "" in Herat , Lamb is awed by that cultured city 's resistance , which was appropriately literary : young women clandestinely studying Shakespeare , James Joyce , Nabokov and Persian poetry , with a child to watch in the lane outside for a Taliban raid .
Two girls confess to doing mathematical calculus in secret for fear their brains would die and risking their lives for a smuggled video of Titanic : they lament that their contemporaries recognise all the words and stars of illicit Hindi films and know nothing of the history of their own beautiful city .
All of which , as Lamb understands , matters more than pages of guns and rubble : I am so glad to discover from her that Sultan Hamidy , who blew blue glass opposite the Friday mosque in Herat , and whispered the name of the war dead into each vessel over the flame , is alive , and still talking poetry about pomegranates and souls .
I shall pile the Russian bowl he sold me with grapes not as sweet as those we ate , and hope he prospers to fire his kiln again ."
2002-12-02,"With timing that only underlined the fragile state of security in his country , Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , today outlined plans to boost the fledgling national army .
As renewed fighting broke out between warlords and a US B-52 made its first bombing raid since the summer , Mr Karzai addressed an international conference in Bonn .
The summit marked a year since the historic accord that installed Mr Karzai as Afghanistan 's post - Taliban leader .
He told delegates today that he had made a decision to have an army that is "" small , effective , well - paid and in service of the nation "" .
His plan provides for the disarmament of former Afghan fighters and bans military forces other than a proposed 70,000-strong national army .
It was hailed as a sign of progess in the attempt to bring security to the country .
Regional warlords still wield great power and Mr Karzai 's authority stretches little further than Kabul .
The US government 's Afghan policy coordinator , David Johnson , said its strength was that all members of the government had agreed on it .
"" It 's a big deal because it sets the structure in place , "" he said .
But the dangers of warlordism were meanwhile being demonstrated in western Afghanistan as two rival forces continued to pound each other with artillery shells .
A local Pashtun commander , Ammanullah Khan , accused Ismail Khan , the Tajik governor of Herat , of launching attacks on Saturday against several small villages at Zer - i - Koh , about 15 miles south of US forces at Shindand air base .
He said Ismail Khan had tried - and failed - to capture Zer - i - Koh on Sunday but his version of events was contested by one of the Herat governor 's officials in Kabul who blamed Ammanullah Khan for starting the fighting .
Violence flares repeatedly in Afghanistan .
Last week , rival warlords General Abdul Rashid Dostum , an ethnic Uzbek , and General Atta Mohammed , a Tajik , clashed in the northern province of Faryab .
In a separate incident US special forces in Herat came under fire from unidentified assailants , prompting them to call in the first reported air strike from a US B-52 bomber since the summer .
The B-52 dropped seven 2,000-pound satellite - guided smart bombs after the special forces were trapped by heavy weapons fire , including rockets and mortars fired from armored vehicles , said Colonel Roger King , a spokesman at US military headquarters in Afghanistan .
US forces have also come under repeated rocket attack in the troubled eastern city of Khost , and last week gunmen ambushed a US special forces convoy near the eastern town of Gardez , wounding one soldier in the leg .
Extending the central government 's authority over the whole country is considered critical for delivering billions in pledged aid and providing the backdrop for planned elections in 2004 .
In the same hilltop hotel outside Bonn where Afghan factions hammered out last year 's accord , Mr Karzai told delegates he would pursue administrative , judicial and financial reform but security remained the top priority .
Key details remained unresolved in Mr Karzai 's army plan , including where three regional commands outside Kabul will be located and who will head them .
The conference drew delegates from the US , Russia , China , Europe and countries neighbouring Afghanistan as well as the UN envoy , Lakhdar Brahimi .
German officials called the conference because of concern that international attention could drift away from Afghanistan in the event of war in Iraq , which could create the need for another costly rebuilding programme .
The German foreign minister , Joschka Fischer , told delegates that rebuilding Afghanistan was central to the success of the international coalition against terrorism . ""
At stake is nothing less than the fight of the civilised world against international terrorism , irrational fanaticism and inhuman crime , "" he said .
"" That is why our common efforts must succeed . """
2002-12-03,"President Hamid Karzai outlined plans for Afghanistan 's new national army at an international conference in Bonn yesterday , as fierce clashes between two rival warlords in the western part of the country highlighted his government 's scant control over law and order outside the capital , Kabul .
An American B-52 bomber dropped seven 2000-pound bombs near the frontline of the battle - the first time the fearsome eight - engined aircraft has been deployed in Afghanistan for several months .
A US military spokesman , said the bombing was carried out after US special forces in the area came under attack .
Nearby , forces loyal to the Pashtun commander Amanullah Khan and those of his Tajik rival Ismail Khan pounded each other 's positions yesterday near the Shindand airbase .
Scores of villagers were reported to be fleeing the area of Zer - e - Koh - about 15 miles south of Shindand amid heavy tank and artillery fire last night .
The fighting - now in its third day - is the most serious in Afghanistan since the demise of the Taliban a year ago . ""
Security is the top priority of our people , "" Mr Karzai told ministers from several governments in Bonn .
Although he announced that he had issued a decree creating the national army , this was a formality since US forces have been training volunteers for the new force for several months .
Progress remains slow and Mr Karzai , as well as most Afghans , have been pushing governments to allow the 5,000-strong international peace - keeping force , Isaf , to be deployed across the country and not just in Kabul .
Foreign governments continued to disappoint him yesterday .
The German government called the conference at the Petersberg castle above the Rhine exactly a year after a meeting of various Afghan groups under UN sponsorship in the same place set up an interim government and chose Mr Karzai as leader .
The new meeting was meant to ensure that foreign governments did not abandon the country now that the United States has forced the international spotlight on to Iraq .
Germany 's foreign minister , Joschka Fischer , told delegates that rebuilding Afghanistan was "" of central importance for the international coalition against terrorism and its success "" .
But with no new aid money on offer , nor a decision to extend Isaf , the conference had little to give but words .
Although security remains weak , Afghanistan has made some progress over the last year .
The latest cereal harvest is 82 % higher than last year , according to UN officials .
This is only four per cent lower than the amount of wheat harvested in 1998 , the last year before a three - year drought .
Some 1,800,000 refugees have returned from abroad , more than double the number expected ."
2002-12-23,"An Afghan soldier was killed and three others wounded yesterday when suspected pro - Taliban fighters fired a rocket at their car in the southern city of Kandahar .
The ambush - on the anniversary of the first year in power of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai - took place shortly after 8 am as the soldiers left the city , officials said .
Nobody claimed responsibility last night but the missile attack was almost certainly the work of disgruntled Islamist fundamentalists .
"" We were driving along the road and suddenly everything exploded , "" said Ahmed Ullah , who was driving the vehicle .
"" They must have been watching us , and saw the route we usually took to the training ground . ""
The incident demonstrates the continuing instability in Afghanistan , more than a year after the Taliban were dislodged from power .
Mr Karzai celebrated his first year in office yesterday and insisted that the country was enjoying relative peace after two decades of conflict .
He can take some pride from the fact that he is still in a job - and , to the surprise of many , still alive .
He narrowly survived an assassination attempt three months ago .
Mr Karzai has also managed to keep his feuding Tajik - dominated government together .
But enormous problems remain - not least the fact that his administration has virtually no control over vast swaths of Afghanistan .
The country 's warlords are firmly back in charge , and resentment towards Mr Karzai 's pro - American policies is growing .
Over the weekend an American soldier was shot dead in a gun battle with a group of suspected Taliban fighters in eastern Afghanistan .
The soldier , Sergeant Steven Checo , was with American special forces near the town of Shkhin .
The patrol had been watching a group of "" seven to nine individuals "" when they opened fire and ran towards the Pakistan border , US military officials said .
Checo was the 17th American serviceman to be killed in Afghanistan since the war on terrorism began late last year .
There are signs that Islamist fighters opposed to America 's continuing presence in Afghanistan are regrouping .
UN officials last week claimed that new al - Qaida camps had sprung up in eastern Afghanistan - although they failed to define whether "" al - Qaida "" meant Arab fighters or merely pro - Taliban Afghans .
Opposition to Mr Karzai 's regime is strongest in the south and east of the country , where the Pashtun Taliban came from .
The US airbase in Kandahar has often come under attack .
Letters regularly circulate here warning Afghans not to support American troops .
The warnings have been issued by Taliban supporters - and by its fugitive leader , Mullah Omar , who is believed to be hiding in the southern province of Oruzgan .
Mr Karzai has other enemies - among them the renegade Islamist warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
Mr Hekmatyar has returned from exile to try to destabilise Mr Karzai 's government and cause an uprising .
Mr Hekmatyar 's troops destroyed Kabul during three years of fighting for the capital between 1993 - 96 by rival mojahedin factions . · German military aviation experts arrived in Kabul yesterday to investigate the cause of a helicopter crash over the weekend that killed all seven German peacekeepers on board .
The Sikorsky CH-53 was on routine patrol over the mountainous city and was on its way back to Kabul airport when it crashed in an industrial neighborhood on Saturday afternoon .
The helicopter suffered from mechanical failure , officials said .
A spokesman for the 4,800-strong multinational peacekeeping force said that two Afghan children who had earlier been reported killed in the crash in eastern Kabul were confirmed alive ."
2003-05-20,"President Hamid Karzai has threatened to resign if Afghanistan regional governors go on hoarding customs revenues rather than handing them to the central government in Kabul .
His angry remark shows how much power still remains in the hands of rebellious warlords and religious fundamentalists 18 months after US forces toppled the Taliban regime and promised to create a properly functioning society .
In a speech broadcast on state television Mr Karzai said the provincial authorities had sent no money to Kabul since mid - March , the beginning of the Afghan fiscal year , and in consequence scores of security personnel and civil servants had not been paid . ""
A few weeks ago the finance ministry reported there was no money in the treasury , but we do have money , "" he said .
"" Hundreds of millions of dollars in customs revenues are being collected in the provinces .
"" Afghanistan 's border provinces straddle lucrative import routes and warlords such as Ismail Khan in Herat and Abdul Rashid Dostum in Mazar - i - Sharif prefer to keep the revenues in their own areas .
Mr Karzai promised that the central government would collect the revenues and redistribute in the provinces equitably .
If the governors failed to comply , he would convene a loya jirga ( grand council ) to pick a new government .
Donors have agreed to give $ 350 m ( £ 216 m ) to the budget this year , and the government is expected to raise $ 200 m .
Mr Karzai said customs revenues alone could bring in $ 600 m .
Security is also getting worse : seven Afghan mine clearers have been shot and one killed in ambushes in the past month ."
2003-05-21,"On the face of it , Hamid Karzai has done well since he was installed by the US in the presidential palace at the end of 2001 .
He has brought a measure of calm to the capital , which remains racked by crime but is at least free of bloody factional fighting .
He has presided over a measure of rebuilding in a civil administration that had all but ceased to exist under the Taliban .
He has helped provide an illusion at least of national unity .
There lies the rub of his present predicament .
The unity is indeed illusory .
That a president should have to threaten to resign in order to extract a promise from his highest lieutenants that they will hand over state revenues , is a measure of the desperate fragility of the enterprise .
The dire , sad fact is that for all intents and purposes Afghanistan is no longer a country at all .
It has no effective joined - up administration .
The physical infrastructure is in a pitiful state .
There is no army worth the name , and no national police organisation .
The economy is in utter ruins .
This lamentable state of affairs is not the result of the Americans blasting the Taliban out of power .
It has existed at least since 1992 , when the ragbag army of mojahedin streamed into Kabul after the collapse of the last ( notionally ) communist regime - and promptly started a new civil war .
Two years later it was the turn of the mojahedin alliance to flee the city as the Taliban swept in from Kandahar in the west .
For all their barbarous cruelty and intolerance , the Islamist thugs did at least provide another kind of illusory unity .
They took over some 90 % of the country and ruled it with brute force as they tried out their version of year - zero revolution .
They may have had some success reimposing a medieval kind of order , but they chose their guests badly .
Osama bin Laden was the greatest foreign admirer of Taliban statecraft , but he brought the whole edifice crashing down when he launched his fanatics at the World Trade Centre .
And now it 's Hamid Karzai 's turn to make sense of the empty space on the map marked Afghanistan .
That he has survived so long is a measure of his own success - and of the marksmanship of the gunman who tried to assassinate him last year .
But Karzai 's success is much more to do with his weakness than his strength .
He is the ruler of the Kabul Valley , not of Afghanistan .
Outside the capital , his writ is purely notional .
Afghanistan remains a patchwork of ethnic , tribal , linguistic and geographical fragments .
Real power rests with the 12 provincial governors , each of them near - absolute rulers of their own fiefdoms .
That is why the president of Afghanistan had to threaten to resign this week , unless the despotic dozen handed over what is due to the government in customs duties and other taxes .
By Afghan standards , the sums involved are huge .
Around $ 500 m ( £ 305 m ) was raised last year in "" national "" duties .
Just $ 80 m got through to Kabul .
The money is desperately needed to keep the tottering apparatus of state upright , and to pay for rudimentary services .
The international community , which promised a cornucopia of aid , has as usual delivered peanuts .
Poor President Karzai , who is a well - meaning man , as well as a proud Pashtun tribal leader , has had in effect to grovel for what is his , or his government 's .
But the force is not entirely against him .
He needs the governors on his side , and they need him too , partly at least because so long as he is in nominal power , nobody else can try to impose his will on the country .
But Karzai is more than a puppet ruler : he lends legitimacy to the current arrangement , and he also has the all - important backing of Washington .
The warlords and petty chieftains of Afghanistan may not have much time for US machinations , but they have a mighty respect for aid dollars and modern weapons .
Men like General Abdul Rashid Dostum in Mazar - i - Sharif and Ismail Khan in Herat , want above all to maintain their provincial power bases , possibly as potential launching pads for future ambitions .
In one sense what is happening now in Afghanistan has been happening for centuries : shifting tribal and ethnic alliances , changing patterns of allegiance , and - literally - marriages of convenience .
The arranged marriage is one of the great pillars of Afghan social organisation .
During the bitter years of Soviet occupation , more than one religious zealot hopped over to the pro - Russian camp because of a tactically important marriage .
There was plenty of movement in the opposite direction too .
The outside world has regularly fallen foul of the tendency to seek ideological motive in Afghanistan 's culture of opportunism and - let 's be honest - rank treachery .
Treaties have been signed , friendships sworn , and handsome bounties paid .
Few have had any meaning .
It 's the same within the ragged boundaries of the country itself .
The most florid pledges are made , accompanied by extravagant assurances of lifelong devotion .
They are worth about as much as the governors ' promises to their president this week ."
2003-05-25,"Afghanistan 's interim President , Hamid Karzai , will issue an extraordinary call this week for an extra $ 15 billion cash from the West for the reconstruction of his war - shattered country .
Karzai will warn that the $ 5bn so far committed is hopelessly inadequate to meet the pledges given by Tony Blair and George Bush to rebuild Afghanistan after the 2001 invasion .
His wake - up call comes as his government plunges into financial crisis , with the capital Kabul facing its first popular street demonstrations since the fall of the Taliban 18 months ago .
The rising discontent follows the failure of central government to pay police and civil servant salaries .
Last week Karzai threatened to resign unless regional warlords paid more revenue into central government coffers .
In a Channel 4 documentary on postwar Afghanistan next weekend Karzai acknowledges his gratitude for Western aid but declares that ' we need more than has been promised . '
He says that the country needs ' $ 15 - 20bn to reach the stage we were in 1979 ' .
He goes on to accuse international donors of undermining his authority by handing the cash to outside agencies rather than central government .
This policy , says Karzai , ' weakens the presence of the central government in the provinces of Afghanistan . '
In a further indication of the gravity of the country 's plight , Lakhdar Brahimi , the United Nations Special Representative to Afghanistan , charged Western nations with sabotaging Karzai 's attempts to bring security .
He disclosed that he had made repeated attempts to widen the international security force in Afghanistan beyond Kabul but that the attempts had been rebuffed .
He said that he asked ' repeatedly ' for the security force to be extended into Afghanistan 's lawless country areas , but that the ' international community tells us that they ca n't afford to respond to our request for the moment ' .
He added : ' If we had this kind of support the Afghans would have been able to look after themselves after one years or two years . '
Brahimi spoke out as the country was plunged into its worst security crisis since the end of the war .
Aid organisations have pulled out of large parts of southern Afghanistan after a series of attacks on international and Afghan humanitarian workers .
A recent study by the Aid agency Care illustrates the scale of the West 's neglect .
It showed that in Kosovo , Bosnia and Croatia , the international community provided one peacekeeper for approximately 60 people .
In Afghanistan the ratio is one to every 5,380 people .
Figures for sums donated , when considered on a per head basis , tell an equally eloquent story .
Bosnians received $ 326 per head during the aftermath of war .
The comparable figure in Afghanistan over the next few years is $ 42 per head ."
2003-06-05,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has held nearly two hours of talks with Tony Blair in Downing Street .
On the second day of his three - day official visit to Britain , Mr Karzai lunched with Mr Blair , the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , and other cabinet ministers .
He arrived with his entourage at No 10 just after 1 pm in a black Jaguar bearing the Afghan flag .
This is his second trip to Britain since becoming leader of the country after the collapse of the Taliban regime .
Wearing a long brown coat and broad smile , Mr Karzai posed for photographers with the prime minister .
The two leaders were expected to discuss the post - war reconstruction of Afghanistan , the new constitution and efforts to eradicate heroin production .
The country is the world 's leading exporter of opium .
Much of the focus was likely to be on the security situation in Afghanistan , where lawlessness is rife and the writ of Mr Karzai 's administration barely runs beyond the capital , Kabul .
Britain is contributing one of eight provisional reconstruction teams due to be set up around the country in an effort to help stabilise the situation .
The British team , based at Mazar - e - Sharif , will comprise around 50 troops as well as civilian officials and will be involved in patrolling and liaising with the local population .
Earlier , Mr Karzai met the defence secretary , Geoff Hoon , and the home secretary , David Blunkett .
Mr Blunkett said : "" I have had a useful and constructive meeting with Hamid Karzai this morning and I am pleased at the continued and helpful co - operation of the Afghan government on the issue of the return of failed Afghan asylum seekers and others who have no basis to stay in the UK .
"" Afghanistan has made significant progress since the fall of the Taliban and the UK is committed to the continued reconstruction of Afghanistan .
We want people to return - preferably voluntarily - so that they can contribute to the rebuilding of their country .
The assistance we provide to returnees is designed to ensure they are equipped to make such a contribution and to aid their re - integration .
"" I am also grateful to the Afghan government for their co - operation on the enforced return of those who have no legal right to be in the UK and do not have protection or humanitarian needs .
So far there have been two enforced returns flights to Afghanistan from the UK and we will continue to work closely with the Afghan government to make sure that those who are returned are properly received back into society . ""
Mr Blair and Mr Karzai emerged smiling from No 10 at 2.30pm .
They chatted briefly on the doorstep , before shaking hands .
Calling out to reporters from his car as he left , Mr Karzai said : "" We had a very nice meeting . ""
We discussed lots of things of political importance . ""
Christian Aid urged Mr Blair to heed Mr Karzai 's calls for a massive expansion of the international peacekeeping force .
Nato 's agreement to take control of the peacekeeping duties in August presented an ideal opportunity , the aid agency said .
Security across Afghanistan was deteriorating by the day , placing the reconstruction of one of the world 's poorest countries in jeopardy , according to the charity . ""
The reconstruction of Afghanistan can not take place until there is sustainable security , "" said Robin Greenwood , Christian Aid 's regional manager for Afghanistan . ""
And Afghans will not trust the international community and the pledges made after the defeat of the Taliban until serious reconstruction takes place -
it 's a catch 22 situation .
"" The Afghan army is weak and at current rates of recruitment it will take 23 years to reach the 70,000-man target . ""
In the short term , Afghanistan needs an expanded and credible international peacekeeping force to hold the line and to allow reconstruction to take place quickly and safely . """
2003-06-09,"Hamid Karzai is one of the more important leaders of the post - September 11 world .
The Afghan president is attempting to raise a democratic , prosperous state from the ruins bequeathed by al - Qaida and the Taliban , the 2001 US invasion and , before that , the Soviet occupation .
His is an enormously difficult task .
Poverty and infant mortality rates are high , much of the country remains beyond his effective control , opium production and trafficking is rising , and insecurity is rife .
Amid almost daily reports of clashes in the east and south , Islamists in western Pakistan are suspected of encouraging a Taliban resurgence whose aim is the expulsion of all foreigners and the transitional administration 's overthrow .
Mr Karzai 's symbolic and practical role in providing a bulwark against these forces of reaction and intolerance is vital .
The US needs Mr Karzai to succeed if its gains in the "" war on terror "" are not to be squandered .
Without his unifying influence , the whole Afghan project would be in serious trouble - which is doubtless why he has not infrequently been targeted by assassins .
All of which begs the question why the west is not doing more in practical terms to assist him .
Visiting Britain last week , Mr Karzai appealed for reconstruction assistance of up to $ 15bn on top of the $ 5bn previously pledged .
Finance minister Ashraf Ghani says that funds received so far have been inadequate , that bankruptcy looms , and that Afghanistan is stuck in a national poverty trap .
Such gloomy analysis does not sit well with planned constitutional reform and the elections due in June next year .
Britain is doing its share through security assistance , expert advisers and multilateral and direct aid .
In 2002 the government promised £ 200 m in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance over five years and is delivering , for example by helping expand education for girls .
Of course , more could be spent .
But other wealthy countries and especially the US should be doing much more , notwithstanding the competing claims of this autumn 's Iraq donors ' conference .
US troops should also join forces with international peacekeepers in expanding stabilisation operations across the country when Nato takes charge in August .
Donald Rumsfeld said last month that the Afghan combat phase was at an end and that the era of reconstruction has begun .
He and his colleagues should show Mr Karzai the colour of their money ."
2003-07-02,"In his first video message since returning to Afghanistan last year , the rebel leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar urges Afghans to "" cut off the hands of the foreign meddlers "" and drive all foreign troops from the country .
The video , on a compact disc received yesterday by the Associated Press , underlines the continuing resistance to President Hamid Karzai and US - led foreign peacekeepers .
Since returning from Iran , where he fled after the Taliban seized power in 1996 , Mr Hekmatyar has been suspected of being behind many attacks on foreign troops .
He and his guards were shown wearing heavy clothing .
He is believed to be in the mountains of Kunar province , along the border with Pakistan ."
2003-07-09,"Amnesty International yesterday warned that most Afghans still "" live in fear "" of arbitrary detention , more than 18 months after the defeat of the Taliban regime .
Irene Khan , Amnesty 's secretary general , met the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , in Kabul yesterday , to press for widespread prison reform and improved security .
The human rights group , in a new report , found that warlords are still operating private prisons across the country , with many civilians held in shackles and detained for months without facing trial .
"" The people of Afghanistan were promised security , development and human rights for all , "" said Ms Khan .
"" But with the international security assistance force confined to Kabul , the real power is back in the hands of feudal power holders and regional commanders . ""
Amnesty said that western donor governments needed to focus funding on the justice ministry , for training and reform .
It singled out the Italian government in particular , because Rome has taken the lead in rebuilding the prison system .
Ms Khan said establishing the rule of law in Afghanistan still presented "" massive challenges "" ."
2003-08-04,"The Economist Editorial , US , August 2 "" The announcement this week of a boost in annual American aid to Afghanistan , to a reported $ 1bn [ £ 620 m ] , should be good news ...
The intent is clear .

At the same time , the White House is calculating that a moderate , democratic Afghanistan will play well for George Bush at home , particularly set against the problems in Iraq ...
"" There has been a growing emphasis by the US on reconstruction .
But reconstruction is a hard message for the Americans to press home .
If it is a useful weapon against terrorism why has there been so little of it in the disaffected Pashtun south of the country ?

Mr Karzai is still alive and in office - no small feat , given his country 's history .
On the other hand , the central government 's writ does n't run far outside Kabul .

"" But money wo n't be enough to save Mr Karzai and the political process ; aggressive steps on security are also needed ...
If Afghanistan is really to have a democratic election and a genuine central government a year from now , the warlords must at last be declawed . """
2003-08-19,"Suspected Taliban fighters attacked a police station in a remote part of south - east Afghanistan early yesterday , killing at least three people .
It was the latest attempt to destabilise the pro - US government of Hamid Karzai .
The fighters attacked a compound in Tarway , a village in Paktika province , a few miles from the border with Pakistan .
They set fire to the building and took four policemen hostage before apparently escaping to Pakistan .
Daulat Khan , the provincial police chief , said : "" There were several hundred of them .
They set the police station on fire , took four of our men and fled . ""
The attack took place hours after insurgents attacked another police station at Barmal , further north in Paktika , killing 22 people .
It was not clear if the same group was re sponsible for both attacks , which are likely to further strain Kabul 's deteriorating relationship with Pakistan .
The violence has angered officials in Mr Karzai 's government who say Pakistan is not doing enough to police its side of the border .
Mr Karzai 's officials said they would raise the issue when the Pakistani foreign minister , Khursheed Kasuri , visits Kabul on Thursday .
Last night a local police chief , Nadir Khan Zadran , said three bodies had been recovered from the scene .
He estimated that about 200 people had been involved in the attack , and said that they were Taliban supporters .
At least 65 people were killed last Tuesday and Wednesday in a series of incidents , including a bomb on a passenger bus ."
2003-08-20,"Independence day celebrations in Afghanistan have been marred by attacks on aid workers and security forces and an explosion that damaged the home of President Hamid Karzai 's brother .
The president 's brother , Ahmed Wali , said the blast yesterday was an accident , caused by a servant at the house in Kandahar moving munitions confiscated in a raid .
Also yesterday , three rockets were fired at a coalition base in Asadabad without doing any damage , the US military said .
On Monday , 12 suspected Taliban insurgents ambushed and killed nine policemen near Kharwar , south of Kabul , a regional commander said .
In another incident on Monday night west of the capital , 20 armed men stormed a compound belonging to the mine dog centre , its director said .
The men beat five employees with rifle butts , fired a grenade at one of their vehicles and set an ambulance on fire .
Police said they had arrested eight suspects .
On the same day , a homemade bomb exploded near coalition troops on patrol on the border with Pakistan .
In the north , a gunman opened fire on Sunday on a vehicle belonging to Save the Children UK , and two of the charity 's Afghan employees were wounded by glass .
In a guarded sports stadium in Kabul , President Karzai led celebrations to mark independence from Britain in 1919 .
"" It is the duty of everybody to launch a holy war to reconstruct this nation , "" he told a crowd ."
2003-09-08,"The US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , arrived in Afghanistan yesterday to bolster Hamid Karzai 's government in the face of continuing battles with Taliban fighters .
Speaking hours after the Afghan government said it had foiled an attack near the Pakistani border , Mr Rumsfeld said there were still concern about infiltration into the country .
"" It is something that requires continuing attention , "" he said at a news conference with Mr Karzai in Kabul .
"" It 's happening all across the globe .
It proves the point that the global war on terror is not a problem in one country or for one country . ""
Mr Rumsfeld said he was hopeful Nato would expand its peacekeeping operations beyond Kabul , but added that security was primarily an Afghan responsibility .
"" I certainly agree that an expansion of Isaf [ the international security assistance force ] would be a good thing , "" Mr Rumsfeld said yesterday .
"" For whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand Isaf , but it strikes me that ... there is at least the possibility of somewhat of an expansion . ""
The Taliban have stepped up their attacks recently , and more than of them have been killed since August 30 , according to the US forces .
About 9,000 American soldiers are still in Afghanistan .
Another 5,000 under Nato command serve as peacekeepers in Kabul .
Scores of residents demonstrated in Kabul yesterday against the US military presence .
Some , unhappy with Mr Karzai 's failure to bring security to many parts of the country , called for the return of the Taliban .
Visiting Afghanistan in May , Mr Rumsfeld said the US had moved from major combat operations to stabilisation and reconstruction .
Each time he has visited the country he has insisted that security is improving .
Since his May visit , the Taliban have carried out almost daily attacks government posts , aid workers and the US - led forces .
Much of the south and the east of the country are off - limits to foreign aid workers .
Mr Rumsfeld did not mention the US plan , announced in July , for a $ 1bn ( £ 631 m ) aid package for Afghanistan .
It is currently spending $ 900 m a month on military operations and $ 900 m a year on economic assistance and training the Afghan army .
The thwarted Taliban attack before Mr Rumsfeld 's arrival was on a district headquarters in Paktika province . ·

He also expressed support for the coalition operation in Iraq , but said he hoped the country would soon have its own government .
The September 11 terrorist attacks had awoken the world to the gravity of the situation in Afghanistan , he told Labour delegates .
As a result , Afghanistan witnessed "" in a magnificent way the cooperation of civilisations , "" he said .
He added : "" A poor , deeply believing Muslim country , a traditional country , was receiving help from the rest of the world , from a different religion , different values . ""

Mr Karzai continued : "" The result of that cooperation today for Afghanistan is that we have now had a government for two years .
We are liberated .
We have political freedom .
We have freedom of the media .
We have , only in Kabul , 80 newspapers printing and all critical of us . ""
More than two million refugees had returned to the country and 4.2 million children were now going to school , he added .
Mr Karzai conceded that civil disorder and drugs were still major problems in Afghanistan , adding : "" Terrorism and extremism is still challenging our life . ""
But he said : "" The end result of the cooperation of civilisations for Afghanistan will be democracy , prosperity , peace and dignity for our people and by extension for the region and , by extension , peace for the rest of the world .

2003-10-11,"Dear Mike
It was hugely entertaining to see Hamid Karzai appear on the platform at the Labour party conference next to the Dear Leader .
Two of Washington 's favourite politicians doing their party turns for the faithful .
Pity Sharon and Chalabi could n't make it .
Next year , perhaps ?
The difference between Britain and Afghanistan , of course , is that in Afghanistan there is a strong opposition .
Karzai is so confident of his popularity in Kabul ( his writ does not extend beyond the capital ) that no Afghan is permitted to guard him .
Elsewhere the various factions of the Northern Alliance and remnants of the Taliban control the country .
The aim of the war and occupation was to capture and kill Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar and shackle al - Qaida .
The result has been a dismal failure .
The video earlier this year of Osama and his deputy wearing their Chitrali hats and strolling cheerfully in the Hindukush was a cheeky reminder that on this front the war has been a dismal failure .
Removing the Taliban from power was always a secondary aim .
The condition of the population is certainly not better today than before the war .
The reconstruction has turned out to be a joke .
The women 's liberation talked about so eagerly at the time by the first ladies of Bush and Blair has come to nought .
More money is being spent on feeding and housing Western troops than on the war - weary citizens of Afghanistan .
And it will end badly , just like the Soviet intervention did in the 80s .
I fear another civil war is waiting in the wings .
Yours , Tariq Dear Tariq , So scathing , so cynical , so wrong .
When I drove through the suburbs of western Kabul , every building I passed had been damaged by 20 years of civil war .
You impressively described those wars in your book , The Clash of Fundamentalisms : Crusades , Jihads and Modernity .
But I saw a lot of people in those derelict homes making bricks and rebuilding .
They were building because they had hope that the future could be better .
I talked to people who were so glad that the Taliban were gone that they had tears in their eyes ; women who no longer had to wear the burqa and who could send their daughters to school .
I went to a school for the blind to present the children with some braille machines because the Taliban had destroyed them all .
"" Failure , "" you say .
It 's not what they say .
Those who opposed intervention in Afghanistan would have denied hope to these people .
But you are right on one thing .
There are still mega - problems .
There are drug warlords and poverty and injustice .
There are terrorist incidents .
The government needs the ability to better enforce its writ outside Kabul .
Yes , it will take years to sort out the mess created over decades .
But there is today a hope that defies any hard - bitten cynicism .
Those people impressed me with their determination to rebuild .
Karzai is an ordinary man trying to do an extraordinary thing , to create a democracy from devastation .
There are no guarantees that he will succeed , but we should do all we can to help .
The UN and the world have not turned their back .
There is a lot of money going in there .
Rebuilding will be hard and will take time , but it is worth it .
Best wishes ,
Mike Dear Mike , You sound like a Pravda man I argued with in the early 1980s .
He too accused me of cynicism when I denounced the Soviet intervention as something that would end badly .
In reality the Russians did push through an effective modernisation in the towns that provided an educational system for all ( including women ) , and the number of women working in schools and hospitals multiplied rapidly .
That was the time when Reagan and Thatcher welcomed the bearded mujahideen and introduced them to the western media as "" the equivalent of our founding Fathers "" .
They certainly were the founding fathers of the Taliban .
I doubt whether the current bunch can do anything that remotely resembles the Soviet modernisation .
How can western regimes busy dismantling the welfare state and privatising everything at home create a social democratic paradise in Afghanistan ?
The burqa is back in business , I 'm afraid , enforced by the men who rule the country with Washington 's blessing .
Human Rights Watch has spoken to women who said they veiled themselves to avoid violence and harassment .
Add to that the fact that ministers are busy demolishing homes ( possibly not the ones you visited ) to grab land , and that senior Afghan military commanders and officials are involved in corruption and violence on a daily basis .
This is reality for the majority of Afghans .
There has been little reconstruction .
Very little of the $ 4.5bn ( £ 2.7bn ) pledged in Tokyo in 2002 - a pittance even then - has come through .
The World Bank estimates that a minimum of $ 13bn is needed to reconstruct the country .
It was no problem finding $ 11bn to fight the war and occupy the country , but it 's virtually impossible to raise funds to repair the infrastructure .
This is the pattern of all the recent wars .
In most cases foreign interventions create more problems than they can solve .
The western states act usually to defend their own interests .
As for poor Hamid Karzai , he is a longtime worker for the US intelligence agencies , like his friend Zalmay Khalilzad who put him there .
But he seems to represent nobody inside Afghanistan .
I fear he might be bumped off despite the all - American bodyguard .
There are two choices .
Either he could be put on a Paris catwalk to model shawls , or the Dear Leader could find him a safe New Labour constituency .
It would be mean - spirited , having used him as a filter , to let the brutes of the Northern Alliance flush him down .
Yours , Tariq Dear Tariq
I doubt that many Afghans would share your charitable view of Soviet occupation .
But let 's not let political prejudice get in the way of the facts , eh ?
$ 4.5bn was pledged at Tokyo but you missed out that it was pledged over 5 years , not all in one year .
Much of that money is now flowing and will continue over the next five years .
Schools have opened , hospitals operate and a road is to be built from Kabul to Jalalabad .
Some $ 1.8bn in foreign aid was spent last year
and the UK alone provided £ 45.5 m at the start of last year .
We are committed to spending £ 322 m over five years - £ 122 million more than we pledged at Tokyo .
Okay , so all this will not create a social democratic paradise .
I think Afghans , like the rest of us , are prepared to wait for paradise if they could get peace and a reasonable standard of living now .
And things are not as bleak as you portray .
Four million children are now back at school , 37 % of them are girls and the numbers are rising ; eight million children have been vaccinated against measles , preventing 30,000 deaths ; over six million children have been immunised against polio ; and more than two million refugees have voted with their feet and returned to Afghanistan because they now have hope .
In addition , more than 400,000 internally displaced persons have also been able to return home .
Not paradise , but Hamid Karzai will not have to go looking for a New Labour constituency .
He will have a few remarkable achievements to put before his own people in the presidential election due in 2004 .
Best wishes , Mike O'Brien
Dear Mike , My only point about the Soviet occupation was that , like Washington , they believed their modernising reforms would do the trick .
Now the arguments you deploy are virtually the same .
The difference is that the Russians did achieve much more .
Incidentally , the figures you supply are already being challenged by all sides .
Many refugees who went back have returned to Pakistan .
Law and order does not exist , not even in parts of Kabul .
The barons of the Northern Alliance control the country and are biding their time .
That 's why I would urge you again to get Karzai out while you can .
He would make a good politician in this country and surely Hartlepool beckons ...
The imposition of a puppet regime , propped up by Nato troops , thousands of miles away from base , is untenable .
It might have helped to build the image of the Dear Leader as a War Leader ( "" ... grave , not grandiloquent ... sincerely moved ...
this emotional fluency is wonderful gift in politics , especially at times of war , "" gushed Philip Stephens in the Financial Times ) .
But no amount of cluster - bombs and daisy - cutters can solve the problem .
Very few Afghans support this occupation .
Sooner or later you 'll have to pull out the Marines .
Then what ?
A Northern Alliance bid for power and a new forward thrust by the Pakistan army .
This time their boys will be clean - shaven and attired in modern dress .
It could go down well on the networks and Fox TV .
The modern soldiers of our closest ally sweeping the bearded men of the Northern Alliance out of the way and retaking Kabul .
It could happen .
I hope , Mike , that you will soon emerge as the leader of the anti - war faction in New Labour , but beware the Hoon example .
He , too , was once a junior minister at the Foreign Office and prone to wild exaggerations .
In reality , and I 'm quite serious , I think you should resign from the government and use your talents to win the party over for the future .
New Labour will probably win the next election , but it has already lost the argument .
Best , Tariq Dear Tariq
Thanks for your email and your solicitations for my future .
I will stick with this government and this government will stick by the Afghans in reconstructing their country .
You attack my figures with vague references to challenges from "" all sides "" .
Name them , I say !
You use the fact - which I readily agree with - that there are problems in security .
But to suggest what ?
That we should leave Afghans to another civil war ?
Perhaps we are the anti - war faction in Afghanistan now .
Like Private Fraser in Dad 's Army you seem to say : "" We 're all doomed !
"" I accept that we need to tackle the security problem .
Some 300 British troops are doing just that , alongside Germans , Canadians and others .
Provincial reconstruction teams have recently been established to address the problems of the warlords .
For the first time in 23 years there is an Afghan government and an army which is representative of all Afghans .
We must continue this work .
And it is not just idealism .
90 % of the heroin in Britain originates in Afghanistan .
The security problem means opium production will go up before it comes down , but if we stick with it and eliminate poppy growth by 2013 we will have helped both Afghanistan and Britain .
We are funding the Afghans to produce sustainable crops to eat and sell instead of poppies .
We can not create paradise there
but we can help reduce the suffering .
By the way , if the Afghans do n't want Karzai - the current choice of their traditional parliament , the Loya Jirga - then in 2004 they can vote him out .
Votes , not bullets , I say !
Best wishes , Mike O'Brien
Dear Mike , It will not work .
First , because there is no representative government ( even in the broadest sense of the term ) in the country .
And I would urge you not to treat the Loya Jirga as anything but a collection of tribal leaders who are bought in the open market .
The Foreign Office where you sit has all the documentation .
The British empire played the same tricks for over a century .
The fact that your chum Karzai is a puppet of Washington is hardly a secret .
The 2004 "" elections "" will be just like the ones the British empire pushed through in Iraq during the early colonial period .
What that produced according to a subsequent British intelligence assessment was "" an oligarchy of racketeers "" .
Idealism , my dear Mike , has nothing to do with any of this .
The Afghan adventure was a crude war of revenge .
The fact that Europeans are involved does n't make it any better .
If New Labour intends new colonisations then these should be openly discussed and argued .
They did n't work before .
Why should they now ?
As for the figures , just look at the Human Right Watch reports on refugees and women .
They are lying on my desk in London and I 'm sending this last one from New York .
Or follow the time - honoured Downing Street method : type out Google.com , write "" Afghan Refugees "" and then see what hits the fan .
On the crucial question of your own future and that of Karzai , let 's continue to talk .
I am concerned .
Best , Tariq Dear Tariq , You present no alternative policy , merely rhetorical fireworks , sparkling but fleeting .
As a minister I have to work out how Britain can help the Afghans to reconstruct their country .
The era of colonialism is dead and any western leader who does not realise this is a fool .
The west can not run Afghanistan but we must empower the Afghans to run it for themselves , then we must get our troops out .
Our best long - term guarantee is a genuine democracy in Afghanistan .
Yes , the Loya Jirga was n't perfect but it was the best we could do at the time .
Next year 's election will be better .
The measure is whether things are improving , not whether they are perfect .
At least we are looking to give the Afghans all the help they need .
Tony Blair promises it and we are delivering .
The figures I quoted are real British taxpayers ' money flowing to help the Afghans .
The difference remains that my responsibility as a minister is to deliver , while your responsibility as a writer is to criticise .
My record will be measured in the improvements in the lives of Afghans , yours in influencing public opinion about Labour .
I still believe government driven by idealism can do good things , you do n't .
So I will get on with helping the Afghans and you will keep on knocking our policy .
Even so , I enjoyed our exchange - a bit of healthy criticism can improve ministerial performance !

2003-10-19,"It lay hidden for 2,000 years in Afghanistan , eluded the Taliban and escaped dozens of adventurers and bounty hunters .
Now the Bactrian hoard , one of the world 's greatest archaeological collections , has been found .
President Hamid Karzai discovered the 20,000 gold coins and artefacts , worth tens of millions of pounds , in a sealed vault under the main palace in the capital , Kabul , after ordering it to be opened earlier this year .
No one expected it to contain the treasure , dating from Alexander the Great 's conquest of Afghanistan in 327BC .
The vault was thought to hold £ 60 million of bullion hidden by the state bank more than a decade ago . '
We opened one box and saw the gold , ' Karzai said .
' Everything is safe and in its place . '
Ashraf Ghani , the Finance Minister , said the treasure was probably the most important collection of antiquities in the world outside Egypt .
It lay in six tombs under the grassy wastes of northern Afghanistan until it was excavated in 1978 by a Soviet archaeologist on the eve of Moscow 's invasion of the country , and was hailed as one of the greatest , and most valuable , archaeological discoveries of all time .
It includes a collapsible gold crown , a solid gold pendant of Aphrodite and a dagger studded with scores of jewels .
Ghani said the vault had not been opened for decades despite efforts by the Taliban , who ruled Kabul from 1996 to 2001 , torturing staff to reveal the code to get at it . '
They were beaten almost senseless but did not reveal it , ' he said .
The surprise find is a boost for Afghanistan , where reconstruction has been progressing slowly and conditions for most people are still very bad ."
2003-12-07,"Donald Rumsfeld , the US Secretary of Defence , is getting around .
Last week it was Kabul to meet with Afghanistan 's President Hamid Karzai .
Yesterday he was in Kirkuk and Baghdad to meet US military and Iraqi civic leaders .
Rumsfeld 's ' appraisal ' visits follow a pattern .
He pops in for a day , then , based on what he sees and hears from inside his protective bubble , declares everything to be just hunky - dory .
Yesterday Rumsfeld remained true to form . '
I am convinced , ' he told reporters in Baghdad , ' that the direction that we set from the outset is the right one and that is being executed exceedingly well . '
He said security arrangements would ' be passed over time to Iraqi security forces of various types ' .
Last week it was Afghanistan where everything was proceeding ' exceedingly well ' towards planned presidential elections in June .
This despite the continuing violence and instability , which was dramatically underlined by yesterday 's bomb in the southern city of Kandahar , which injured 18 people .
The difference between Afghanistan and Iraq is that Afghan ministers and the UN have had a little longer to consider how the declarations of the Pentagon 's own Candide meet up with the reality on the ground .
Many insist that security must improve - with the aid of more foreign troops - to ensure the vote is fair and includes all the country 's bitterly divided groups . '
I do n't think incomplete elections will be acceptable to anyone , ' Karzai 's Interior Minister , Ali Ahmad Jalali , told reporters on Thursday . '
The Government is determined to hold the timetable .
But if something happens we will have to make a decision on whether to wait . '
If this rush into a bright new future sounds familiar it is because it is .
Iraq too , amid similarly growing violent instability , is being pushed down a path that has been only barely successful in Afghanistan : towards a transitional government selected by caucus , which then must try to write a constitution and hold national elections .
And the greatest problem in both countries is the one that George Bush 's great experiment to bring Western - style democracy tends to forget : the fact that self - interested local power structures continue to operate pretty much unchallenged in both countries .
I was reminded of this earlier this month by the report of a friend who lives in the Iraqi city of al - Kut , who told me of going to listen to a sermon by a follower of the firebrand Islamist leader Moqtada al - Sadr .
A dynamic and charismatic young man , he has been attracting thousands to his sermons .
His name is not one to elicit any kind of recognition so far - and that is rather the point .
For as the American - led Coalition Provisional Authority accelerates , apparently unstoppably , towards a handover of sovereignty in Iraq to a transitional government next summer , a critical question is emerging .
Does Ambassador Paul Bremer and the CPA have any idea who really speaks for Iraqis ?
Seen from a distance , it seems a facile question .
The hand - picked Iraqi governing council - in theory at least - is designed to represent the ethnic and nascent political diversity of Iraq .
But examine Iraq 's cities and governates close up and it no longer seems such a stupid question .
For who speaks for Iraqis at a local level - as in Afghanistan - is a constellation of competing interest groups and local elites which make the issue of a smooth transition to democratic governance fraught not only with difficulties but real danger .
At its centre is perhaps the biggest misunderstanding by the occupying powers of Iraqi society and culture in a troubled and error - strewn post - invasion period .
While Afghanistan 's warlordism is pretty much self - evident , what has been revealed in the aftermath of the collapse of Saddam Hussein 's regime is just how flawed was our simple model of his dictatorship .
Flawed because we imagined his secret state to be more encompassing than it was .
Instead , what has emerged in the months since the regime is how much Saddam sub - contracted large elements of authority to different elites - from tribal leaders to businessmen and religious leaders .
They were bound by money or threats to his Baathist project and are now released to command their own tiny realms .
It would be wrong to suggest that the CPA is not trying to introduce some notions of grassroots democracy in Iraq , but the time - frame for such a root and branch reform of an entire society and its social system , as in Afghanistan , is too short to make any kind of impact .
Indeed , the CPA will be rolled up next summer with the handover of sovereignty , with as yet no clear indication what will take its place .
As Pakistan , Afghanistan 's neighbour , has learnt in decades of lurching between corrupt civil and military governments , breaking up local and national elites is a challenge that spans decades , not just months .
What both Iraq and Afghanistan need is not just glib reassurances from the US that everything is going brilliantly , but a realistic , long - term international commitment ."
2004-01-02,"Afghanistan 's constitutional convention has been forced to adjourn for two days in the face of a boycott by opponents of the president , Hamid Karzai .
The delay is the most severe setback yet to the country 's attempt to put its vision of a better future on paper , and raises the possibility that the historic gathering could end in failure .
Yesterday scores of delegates refused to take part in a vote on several amendments to the draft charter .
Mr Karzai 's opponents are particularly angry about his insistence on a strong presidency , which they fear could shut minorities out of power .
Officials said that more than half of the 502 members of the loya jirga had voted , enough to make the results binding .
But after hours of argument behind the scenes the meeting was postponed to allow more time to seek a compromise .
Mr Karzai insists that a simple majority of those voting is enough to carry the charter , but most observers recognise that a constitution which does not have wide - ranging support will hamstring the country as it seeks to put 20 years of conflict behind it .
The loya jirga has spent well over two weeks arguing about the charter in a huge tent on a Kabul college campus .
Having failed to get fractious ethnic groups to agree , the council 's leaders read out a list of proposed amendments yesterday morning , and called for some decisions .
The chairman , Sibghatullah Mujaddedi , said : "" We have had enough speeches .
Let 's start voting . ""
Some delegates quickly queued to put their ballots in one of the 10 boxes , but 200 stayed in their seats .
Mahsa Toyie , a Tajik delegate from Herat , accused the government of trying to impose an unfair draft on small minorities .
"" This constitution is not for one tribe , it is for the whole country , "" she said .
A draft presented by the government in November foresaw a tolerant Islamic state under the firm control of a centralised presidency .
Mr Karzai appears to have persuaded a majority at the council that the country needs clear leadership .
But his support comes mainly from his Pashtun kinsmen , and he is opposed by the smaller groups from the north who helped the United States depose the mainly Pashtun Taliban two years ago .
Northerners such as the Tajik leader Burhanuddin Rabbani , who was president during the 1992 - 96 civil war , say that Mr Karzai 's plans could one day lead to a dictatorship and provoke new conflict .
Council leaders said that a hotly disputed proposal for the national anthem to be sung in Dari , the Farsi - related lingua franca of much of the country , as well as in Pashto , had not drawn attracted a sufficient number of signatures .
Several delegates expressed frustration at the ominous tone of the debate .
Ashmat Ghani , a prominent Pashtun delegate and the brother of Afghanistan 's finance minister , accused some leaders of manipulating the ethnic issue . ""
Do not call us Pashtun , Uzbek , Hazara .
There are family relations between all groups , "" he said .
"" I am happy for my son to go to school and learn several of the languages of my country , "" he added .
· Three US soldiers were wounded in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan in clashes that also left up to 14 fighters dead , the military said yesterday .
The gun battle was the latest in a succession of clashes in the south and east of the country , where suspected Taliban and al - Qaida militants have launched regular attacks on US forces and their Afghan allies ."
2004-03-29,"Afghanistan 's elections were postponed to September yesterday , owing to insecurity and the UN 's slow pace in registering voters .
The postponement comes despite Washington 's insistence to President Hamid Karzai that the vote be in June .
Commentators say George Bush wanted to present Afghanistan as a foreign policy success in good time for the US elections in November .
More than halfway through the six months allotted for voter registration , the UN has garnered barely 10 % of the 10.5 million estimated to be eligible .
Its efforts have been hit by violence that has left southern Afghanistan practically off - limits to its staff .
Last week more than 100 were killed in factional fighting in Herat - previously considered the safest place in the country .
"" The UN says the later the election is held , the safer it is likely to be , "" an Afghan government spokesman said to explain the postponement .
Mr Karzai said September would allow presidential and parliamentary elections to be held simultaneously .
With still no electoral law , to delimit constituencies , and still no registered parties , UN staff are sceptical that a parliamentary election can be held this year .
A senior UN official in Kabul said September was the cut - off point , because after that most of the country was cut off by snow , and September did not appear possible .
Taliban forces , resurgent in the south , have threatened to disrupt the elections .
A statement on Saturday said the postponement was an embarrassment for the US , and reiterated the Taliban view that elections were intended to distract Afghans from their responsibility to fight a holy war against Mr Karzai ."
2004-03-31,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , warned yesterday that there was virtually no prospect of his building a "" safer and better "" country unless the international community found £ 15bn for its reconstruction .
Speaking on the eve of a conference on Afghanistan in Berlin , the third since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , Mr Karzai offered a seven - year plan that would , he said , rebuild institutions , guarantee security , and stop his country being a "" burden "" on the world .
Mr Karzai also said the drug trade was a menace to Afghanistan .
"" We have a serious serious problem in that area , "" he admitted .
The president 's plea came ahead of today 's start of the two - day conference , which will be attended by the US secretary of state , Colin Powell , Britain 's foreign secretary , Jack Straw , and representatives of more than 50 countries and financial institutions .
The backdrop is unpropitious : continuing insecurity , rampant opium production , renewed factional fighting , and the decision last week to postpone elections until September .
Many believe this date to be optimistic .
So far only 1.6 million out of 10.5 million Afghan voters have been registered .
Speaking yesterday after meeting the conference host , the German chancellor , Gerhard Schröder , Mr Karzai said it was in the interest of all western countries that Afghanistan did not end up a failed state .
"" We will be asking them to increase their assistance to Afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing - on - its - own feet Afghanistan , thereby also helping international security , "" he said .
Asked what would happen if he did not get help , Mr Karzai declined to comment .
The plan , entitled Securing Afghanistan 's Future , asks for $ 27.6bn ( £ 15.1bn ) over the next seven years .
The amount would not be lavish , merely raising the average Afghan 's income from $ 200 to $ 500 a year , his officials said .
Britain has agreed to give £ 500 m over the next five years .
The Bush administration is today likely to offer $ 1bn on top of the $ 1.2bn already pledged .
Pledges this week are expected to cover only a fraction of the total requested by Mr Karzai .
Donors worldwide have pledged $ 4.2bn through this year .
And officials in Kabul repeatedly express frustration that much money promised by the international community never arrives .
Britain has also announced that is sending 100 more soldiers to Afghanistan as part of a Nato plan to pacify the entire country and clamp down on the warlords .
There are 400 British troops already there as part of a 6,500 Nato - led peacekeeping force , as well as 13,000 US troops involved in the flagging hunt for Mullah Mohammed Omar , the Taliban leader , and Osama bin Laden .
Last night British charities in Afghanistan warned there would be "" catastrophic consequences "" if the international community failed to honour its pledges .
"" There is a big gap between what has been promised and what has been delivered .
Everybody has delivered a bit .
But nobody has delivered as much as they originally promised , "" said Kate Bulbian of Care International .
So far the world had given $ 67 for every Afghan - far less than had been spent on other conflict areas including Kosovo , Rwanda and East Timor , she said .
As well as security and the UN 's struggling attempts to register voters , the conference is also likely to discuss drug production and trafficking .
British - led efforts to wipe out opium production in Afghanistan have so far been an embarrassing failure .
Since the Talibans ' fall in 2001 , opium output has soared - 1.7 million Afghans are harvesting or growing the crop .
"" The fight against drugs is actually the fight for Afghanistan , "" Mr Karzai said yesterday .
"" If we want to have Afghanistan , we must fight drugs .
"" Aid and rights organisations say the international community should focus its efforts as much on manpower as financial support , arguing that the Nato peacekeepers in the country should be dramatically augmented to enable forces to tackle hinterland problems such as drug cultivation ."
2004-03-31,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , will today make another high - profile plea for international aid at an aid conference in Berlin .
Afghanistan is seeking $ 27.5bn ( £ 15bn ) for the next seven years , but is likely to receive only a fraction of that amount .
The EU has pledged € 245 m ( £ 163.3 m ) , and the US is expected to offer $ 1bn on top of the $ 1.2bn it has pledged this year .
The Afghan government points out that the requested aid is not charity that will benefit only Afghanistan .
A government study earlier this month , entitled Securing Afghanistan 's Future , said that aid would "" enhance regional stability , reduce the global threats of drugs and terrorism , and lower the associated defence security - related costs of many nations "" .
However , unless something can be done to improve security , pledges of money will have little effect .
"" There is no point in throwing money at the country when near - anarchy reigns .
The UN ca n't even operate in half the country , "" said Dominic Nutt , an emergencies officer with Christian Aid , which has a base in Herat , western Afghanistan .
Mr Karzai 's writ is largely confined to Kabul .
Last week , more than 100 people were killed in factional fighting in Herat , which had previously been considered to be the safest place in the country .
Because of widespread insecurity , and the UN 's slow pace of registering voters , elections in Afghanistan have been postponed until September .
The delay has come despite Washington 's insistence that the vote should take place in June - something that would have enabled the White House to point to Afghanistan as a foreign policy success before George Bush faced the US presidential elections in November .
There is a large , powerful US military force in Afghanistan , but its prime ( if unspoken ) task is to hunt down Osama bin Laden rather than to prop up Mr Karzai .
The 10,000 US troops operate on either side of the border with Pakistan .
Nato forces are also overstretched .
The US - led military alliance took over command of the 6,500-strong International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) last August .
It was the first time that Nato , no longer faced with a Soviet threat , had moved out of its traditional European theatre of operations .
After repeated urgings from non - governmental groups and analysts , Nato countries last October agreed to expand their peacekeeping mission beyond Kabul and one or two other centres , but troops are only now being shifted .
Britain , which has 400 troops in Afghanistan , is about to send 100 more as part of an ambitious Nato plan to try and pacify the entire country and clamp down on warlords .
The British troops , which have been operating only in Kabul , will lead a multinational Northern Group .
The Nato plan , expected to be agreed in Brussels next week , will require thousands of extra troops from around the world .
The aim is to consolidate the north , then the west , south and east .
But so far , Nato is having trouble following up on its promises .
Belgium , the Netherlands and Turkey have not provided the helicopters they had pledged because of concern over costs .
The US finally stepped in to send off the helicopters , but has insisted that Luxembourg foot the bill .
"" We keep asking the alliance countries to deliver what they have promised .
We are not setting unrealistic expectations .
Everything we ask for is needed , "" General James Jones , Nato 's top military chief , told the Financial Times .
The expansion of Nato 's role is long overdue .
Local struggles for power , fuelled in some areas by the opium trade , have contributed to growing disorder and violence .
Southern Afghanistan is virtually a no - go area for government troops , and the drugs problem has also muddied the security picture .
Russia has gone so far as to accuse Nato of turning a blind eye to the opium trade to ensure the support of warlords in the struggle to maintain security .
Such a policy posed a serious threat to the national security of all the central Asian states and Russia , Sergei Ivanov , Russia 's defence minister , has said .
Another problem is the decision of the US - led coalition forces to combine security and reconstruction roles .
Non -
governmental organisations are wary about the move , which has come in response to insecurity outside Kabul .
Provincial reconstruction teams of between 50 and 100 troops have to maintain security and also identify - and sometimes implement - reconstruction projects .
"" It is an impossible list of duties , "" says Mr Nutt , who believes that security forces should stick to peacekeeping .
As US - led coalition forces are actively involved in hostilities , for them to be active in reconstruction activities as well puts the security of aid workers at risk , he argues .
Afghanistan has made some ground in creating a new national army , but its present strength is only around 6,500 , well short of the 70,000 target .
For the foreseeable future , Afghanistan 's security rests with Nato and its economic development depends on foreign aid .
Time is not on Mr Karzai 's side .
The Afghan government study says that the country 's prospects are bleak if foreign governments cut back their commitments .
"" If this is the case , the significant progress that has been made is likely to be rapidly unwound , with an increasing descent into lawlessness , characterised by local militias and increasing drug production . """
2004-04-01,"International donors pledged $ 4.4bn ( £ 2.4bn ) for Afghanistan yesterday , after Hamid Karzai , the president , urged international donors to help prevent his country from becoming a haven for drugs and terrorism .
"" This is 100 % of our target , "" Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai Afghan , the finance minister said in Berlin yesterday .
The pledge towards reconstruction and budget costs for 2004 - 2005 far outweighs the $ 4.5bn over five years pledged at a 2002 donors ' conference in Tokyo .
However , Mr Karzai 's government says it needs $ 27.6bn over seven years .
"" Nobody wants to be called a drug dealer , especially not a whole nation , "" Mr Karzai had said earlier , warning of the dangers of private militias and drug cultivation in the region . ·
A Glasgow - based charity , Spirit Aid , announced it was auctioning 20 drawings by celebrities on the internet to raise money for children in Afghanistan .
The drawings include work by Sir Paul McCartney , Brigitte Bardot and the actor Robert Carlyle ."
2004-04-08,"A new sort of jihad was called for this week by Afghanistan 's likeable but weak president , Hamid Karzai .
Speaking after the Berlin conference of international aid donors , Mr Karzai said that his country 's recovery will require a holy war against "" warlordism and poppy cultivation "" .
There could be no sustainable security "" unless the society is free of narcotics and irresponsible armed groups "" .
No one disputes that the problem of opium production has got vastly worse since the war which ousted the Taliban .
As has been well documented by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , opium production rose twentyfold in two years after being sharply reduced by the Taliban in its last year in power .
Yet this embarrassing truth is subtly shaded in Washington , which minimises the drug- trafficking role of the Afghan warlords - whom the war restored to power - while playing up the alleged involvement of Taliban remnants and associated "" terrorist groups "" .
Robert Charles , the state department 's top counter - narcotics official , spoke last week of "" the traffickers and the terrorists they feed "" , as if they were the real problem .
Mr Karzai should be congratulated on identifying the true culprits .
Just how much the international anti - drugs effort ( in which Britain is the lead nation ) can do about it is another matter .
In February Britain sponsored an anti - drugs conference in Kabul at which Afghan officials made a despairing appeal .
More technical aid , though badly needed , would not be enough , they said , without "" a powerful centre ( of government ) to exert control over the provinces and support action at the local level "" .
No amount of "" public awareness campaigns "" is going to solve the drug problem unless the warlords - whom ordinary Afghanis remember as killers before the Taliban took over - can be curbed .
The experienced journalist Kathy Gannon paints a devastating picture of their role in the current issue of Foreign Affairs :
"" All these men share responsibility for the ferocious killing of the mid-1990s [ before the Taliban took over ] , "" she writes .
"" They still maintain private armies and private jails , and are reaping vast amounts of money from Afghanistan 's illegal opium trade ... "" The Berlin conference has now pledged the sort of aid that Afghanistan needed two years ago .
There are also signs that the US may have begun to reduce its reliance on the warlords .
But Afghanistan has become the half - forgotten war before Iraq : the drugs disaster is only one of its disturbing lessons which have yet to be learned ."
2004-04-09,"Fighters loyal to one of Afghanistan 's most powerful warlords have seized a major northern city from pro - government forces , raising fears that the country is sliding into civil war .
The forces of General Abdul Rashid Dostum , a special adviser to President Hamid Karzai , who is known for crushing his prisoners under tanks , invaded the northern province of Faryab on Wednesday , according to officials .
The provincial capital , Maimana , fell yesterday after Gen Dostum 's forces attacked it , officials said .
According to Mr Karzai 's spokesman , Jawed Ludin , the city was yesterday in the hands of "" irresponsible armed individuals from neighbouring provinces and areas around Maimana "" . ""
General Dostum is an adviser to the president .
However , that does not give him the right to deploy forces or get involved in any military operational issues , "" Mr Ludin said .
Maimana 's governor and its pro - government commander , General Hashim Habibi , were reported to be 20 miles east of Maimana .
As skirmishes flared across Faryab yesterday , observers said Gen Dostum , who maintains a private army of fellow Uzbeks based in northern Mazar - e - Sharif , was intent on removing Gen Habibi because he had stopped obeying his orders .
More significantly , analysts said , it was the second occasion in less than a month that a powerful warlord had provoked an armed confrontation with the government .
Last month there were bloody battles in the western city of Herat - previously considered the safest city in Afghanistan - between pro - government fighters and militiamen loyal to the city 's warlord governor , Ismail Khan .
Mr Khan 's men triumphed , driving Mr Karzai 's troops from the city and leaving scores of men dead .
About 150 members of the new US - trained national army were dispatched to Faryab yesterday , though there were no reports of them arriving in Maimana .
A similar number of government soldiers were sent to Herat and confined to barracks .
With landmark elections due in September , analysts said the fighting showed that Mr Karzai had little control of most of the country . ""
First in Herat , and now in the north , we 're seeing war lords taking on the central government and succeeding , "" said Samina Ahmed of the International Crisis Group .
"" With the elections pending , this shows that Karzai is going to have a really big problem on his hands . ""
Attention on Afghanistan 's chronic insecurity has mostly focused on the south and east of the country , where attacks by Taliban guerrillas and other Islamist militants have claimed hundreds of lives in recent months .
"" This violence has far - reaching consequences , it 's very worrying , "" Ms Ahmed said .
"" In the south , the insurrection is being run by poor individuals who have not profited in the slightest from the war two years ago . ""
Now we 're seeing powerful commanders also confronting the government .
This is a far more dangerous development than anything we 've seen in the south . ""
During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , Gen Dostum emerged as the leader of a pro - Soviet militia .
He has since changed sides many times in three conflicts , turning first against the Soviet - backed administration , then against the mojahedin government that replaced it .
Gen Dostum 's forces were crushed by the Taliban , though he returned to Afghanistan from exile shortly before the clerics were bombed from power .
As a leader of the anti - Taliban Northern Alliance , Gen Dostum was a firm favourite with the US .
He was rewarded with the job of deputy defence minister in Mr Karzai 's first cabinet ."
2004-04-10,"An Afghan warlord whose seizure of a northern province has threatened the stability of the country refused yesterday to back down and said heads would have to roll in Kabul or the entire government of President Hamid Karzai would fail .
General Abdul Rashid Dostum 's forces advanced further into Faryab province in northern Afghanistan having taken the provincial capital Maimana on Thursday .
Hundreds of government troops have been dispatched to the region and it was unclear last night who had the upper hand .
Gen Dostum , who has maintained control over swaths of northern Afghanistan since helping US forces oust the Taliban in 2001 , insisted Mr Karzai sack officials including his defence minister , Mohammad Qasim Fahim .
"" If he does not , his government will fail , "" he told Reuters .
He said he would not fire on national army troops who had apparently restored order in Maimana , though not in other parts of the province .
Gen Dostum , who is nominally a special adviser to President Karzai , has changed sides repeatedly through two decades of conflict in Afghanistan .
The unrest has raised fears of backsliding towards anarchy months before elections .
The upheaval also comes at a sensitive time for President Bush at a time when US forces are on the back foot in Iraq ."
2004-05-03,"Three young girls in eastern Afghanistan were in critical condition in hospital last night after being poisoned , apparently by militants as punishment for attending school .
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , said those responsible for the poisonings , in the province of Khost , were less than human .
He said the attack had been carried out by terrorists and was the work of foreign elements .
"" I will not call anyone an Afghan or a Muslim who poisons an eight - year - old child because she is schoolgoing , "" Karzai said .
"" They are beasts . ""
Vikram Parekh , from the International Crisis Group , said there had been a series of attacks on girls ' schools , particularly in the south of the country , in recent months but this was the first time children had been attacked .
"" A girl 's school was recently burnt to the ground in Kandahar and others have been attacked , but this is a horrible development to see that the girls themselves would be targeted , "" he told the Guardian .
Few details of the incident were available last night , but militants are angry about the Karzai government 's reversal of a Taliban ban on female education .
Attacks on schools have also taken place in Pakistan 's neighbouring North West Frontier Province .
More than four million students are enrolled in schools this year - more than ever before - including one - third of the country 's girls .
But the transition has not been without problems and many conservative families still refuse to send their daughters to school .
The poisoning followed a weekend of violence in Afghanistan after US troops killed four people .
According to the US military , it launched the attack when one of its convoys was attacked south of Kabul .
A US spokesman , Lieutenant Colonel Michael DeWerth , said two American soldiers had been injured in the attack .
"" Four unidentified anti - coalition militia troops were killed , two [ militants ] were injured and were taken for medical care , and two [ militants ] were detained , "" Lt Col DeWerth said .
He said the US had used air support to attack the militants , but provided no other details .
But Afghan officials disputed this version of events and said those killed had been Afghan police .
The provincial police chief , General Haygul Salemankhel , told Associated Press the shooting had taken place because of a mix - up as the convoy approached a police checkpoint under cover of darkness .
He said three of his men had been killed and two injured , and that the wounded men were being treated at the nearby US base . ""
Because of a misunderstanding , they open - ed fire on each other , "" Gen Salemankhel said .
· An accidental explosion at a gas station has killed at least 25 people in western Afghan - istan , the government said .
At least another 40 were injured in the blast near Shindand , 360 miles west of Kabul ."
2004-06-12,"The elections in Afghanistan seem certain to be delayed for a second time , dealing a damaging blow to President George Bush 's own election campaign .
The delay comes amid growing concern about the security of the election process after the killing on Thursday of 11 Chinese construction workers .
It is now impossible for the election to be held legally in September , the date for which both the interim government of President Hamid Karzai and the United Nations were aiming , itself a delay from the intended June polling day .
It is understood that the new date is likely to be around October 5 .
It has also emerged that not a single dollar pledged to pay for the elections has been given by donor countries , including members of the EU and the US .
Even if the $ 70 m ( £ 38 m ) pledged is given , there is still a shortfall in paying for the $ 101 m costs of a proper election , an indication of how far the international community 's attention has shifted away from Afghanistan since the official end of the hostilities .
The lack of money is hampering registration .
Under Afghanistan 's electoral process , 120 days have to elapse between the certification of the constituencies and polling day .
That work was only completed last week , which rules out the September date still being promoted by the authorities .
According to Reg Austin , the chief technical adviser to the UN 's joint electoral management body , the earliest possible date is early October .
"" We are not in September any more , "" he said .
"" The law is quite clear and that takes us inexorably into October .
"" Even this date is by no means certain .
If the security situation worsens or the registration process stalls because of violence and intimidation in the southern and south - eastern areas , a decision could be made to post pone the vote until next spring , although President Karzai is strongly committed to a vote this year .
There are concerns within the international community that not enough time has been given for the electoral process . ""
Given Afghanistan 's history and the international community 's responsibility in that history , it should allow the Afghan people sufficient time to prepare themselves for the election , if it is to have any credibility , "" said Barbara Stapleton of the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghanistan Relief ( ACBAR ) .
"" If the elections are held before the country is prepared , it may well lock Afghanistan 's politics into a very dangerous course . ""
On some levels the registration drive has been going well , said a UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan spokesman .
An estimated 3.4 million people have now registered , around a third of the desired total of 9.5 million , and women have registered in far higher numbers than expected , with at least a million enrolled .
In some provinces , including ones such as Herat regarded as conservative , women are accounting for almost half the registered voters .
President Karzai is currently in the US , where he has been meeting President Bush .
Mr Bush is anxious that Afghanistan should go to the polls before his own date with the electorate in November so that , with the condition in Iraq deteriorating , he can point to at least one foreign democratisation process .
The role of the US government is regarded as a major factor .
While it would be damaging to Mr Bush if Afghanistan were not at the polls before his own date with the electorate , it might be even more harmful if the election took place and was a shambles with some provinces barely participating ."
2004-07-12,"The warlords and private militias who were once regarded as the west 's staunchest allies in Afghanistan are now a greater threat to the country 's security than the Taliban , according to the interim president , Hamid Karzai .
His claim comes in the wake of a decision to delay the presidential election for a second time and to postpone the parliamentary elections until next spring because of a sharp increase in violence . ""
The frustration that we have in this country is that progress has sometimes been stopped by private militias , life has been threatened by private militias , so it should not be tolerated , "" he told the New York Times . ""
Without disarmament , the Afghan state will have really serious difficulties .
"" There are now estimated to be around 50,000 armed militiamen attached to warlords , despite attempts to get them to hand in their weapons before the election .
So far , only an estimated 10,000 have agreed to leave the militias and only 7,000 weapons have been handed in .
While the Taliban have been blamed for much of the recent violence , which has been in protest at the elections , there is evidence that warlords are taking advantage of the unstable situation outside Kabul .
"" We tried to do it by persuasion , "" Mr Karzai said of attempts to disarm the militia .
"" The stick has to be used , definitely . ""
He dismissed the Taliban threat as "" exaggerated "" .
Mr Karzai is the clear favourite to win the presidential election , which is now scheduled for October 9 .
He faces no real threat from any of the militia leaders , which has led to claims he has done a deal , an allegation he denies .
He said he regretted that the parliamentary elections were being delayed until next year but accepted that people would like to see the militia substantially disarmed before going to the polls .
The president also accepted that corruption would have to be tackled to win the confidence of the electorate .
"" We will have many more messy years to come before we can claim that we have succeeded , "" he said ."
2004-07-23,"One of Afghanistan 's most notorious former warlords , General Abdul Rashid Dostum , has announced that he will challenge the US - supported Hamid Karzai in this October 's presidential election .
His decision to resign as military adviser to the government and exploit his northern powerbase - where he has the support of a significant Uzbek minority - has raised fears that the campaign will impose severe strains on the country 's splintered ethnic and tribal divisions . ""
Dostum has decided to stand because he is unhappy with Karzai 's policies , "" a senior aide , Akbar Bai , revealed .
One of the grievances , he maintained , was that the president persisted in describing non - Pashtun commanders as "" warlords "" .
The drive by the Kabul government to disarm factional forces had been "" imbalanced "" , Mr Bai added .
The groups targeted were chiefly those in the north and west of the country .
Under election regulations , Gen Dostum had to resign any military posts he held before he could declare his candidacy .
The announcement was made on Thursday at a hotel in the key northern city of Mazar - i - Sharif , at the heart of his native territory .
In his speech , he insisted his goal was national unity .
Gen Dostum , who was deputy defence minister in Afghanistan 's first post - Taliban administration , remains a major powerbroker in the nation 's affairs .
He has retained effective control over large portions of the north of the country since the defeat of the Taliban in 2001 .
In April , Gen Dostum was accused by Mr Karzai 's allies of driving a Kabul - appointed governor from a neighbouring north - eastern province .
A former communist , Gen Dostum - a burly , moustachioed figure - has been an adept switcher of sides in the numerous invasions and civil wars which have ravaged Afghanistan since the Russians arrived in 1979 .
In the past his forces have been renowned for their brutal suppression of opponents .
Prisoners have been crushed under the wheels of tanks .
Hundreds of Taliban captives are alleged to have suffocated to death while being transported in sealed shipping containers after the end of the fighting .
October 's elections will be Afghanistan 's first free and direct vote and observers hope that the country will not divide along ethnic lines .
Monday is the last day for candidates to register .
The country 's parliamentary elections , which still require more work to establish constituency boundaries , will not be held until next spring .
Pashtuns form the largest ethnic group and have traditionally ruled the country .
But Mr Bai insisted that Gen Dostum could beat Mr Karzai because fewer people had registered to vote in Pashtun heartlands of the south and east due to threats of violence and customs that discourage women from taking part .
There are about 20 candidates in the presidential race .
Gen Dostum has declined to hand over all of his heavy weapons to the central government under a nationwide disarmament plan , arguing that it should also cover east and south Afghanistan , the main areas where the Taliban and Islamist militant allies are active .
"" If we have really free elections , Karzai will not be able to win , because the registration process is very slow in the south and east where he comes from , and we have lots of registrations in the north , "" Mr Bai said .
Two weeks ago , President Karzai said "" warlords "" and their private militias posed a bigger threat to stability and security in Afghanistan than the ongoing Taliban - led insurgency , which is estimated to have claimed about 900 lives in the past year .
Some observers believe that the fact that a figure as powerful as Gen Dostum is willing to take part in elections is a positive sign , proving that it is accepted that democratic legitimacy is more effective route to power than resorting to weapons ."
2004-07-26,"The interim president of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai , today announced that he would stand as a candidate in the country 's first direct presidential election next month .
Mr Karzai surprised observers by dropping one of the country 's most powerful warlords , the defence minister , Mohammed Fahim , from his ticket .
It had been expected that Mr Fahim would be named as one of Mr Karzai 's two vice - presidential running mates .
Ahmad Zia Massood , the brother of the assassinated Afghan mujahideen hero Ahmad Shah Massood , replaces Mr Fahim as a running mate .
Ahmad Shah Massood was the leader of the Northern Alliance when he was killed in September 2001 , and the inclusion of his brother on the electoral ticket could appeal to voters in the north .
Mr Karzai is from the Pashtun ethnic group , the majority group in the east and south .
Ahmad Zia Massood is Afghanistan 's current ambassador to Russia .
Karim Khalili , Mr Karzai 's choice for second vice - president , is a Hazara leader .
"" I hope the Afghan people will recognise us as a good team , and I hope the people of Afghanistan will vote for us , "" Mr Karzai , who was flanked by his vice - presidential choices and dozens of aides and security guards , said at a press conference .
It was not clear whether Mr Fahim would stay on as defence minister , or whether he would seek to stand against Mr Karzai .
He had no immediate comment to make .
Today was the deadline for papers for the October 9 election to be submitted , with rules stating that ministers must resign from their posts if they wish to stand for the presidency or vice - presidency .
Thousands of militia soldiers , most of them loyal to Mr Fahim , remain in Kabul , including a division still untouched by a drive to round up and remove heavy weapons from the city .
NATO peacekeepers were today taking no chance over potential trouble .
Convoys of German and Canadian armoured vehicles picked their way through crowded roads , while US troops parked two Humvees at the top of the streets leading to the country 's electoral office .
The office was guarded by Afghan national army troops and intelligence officers .
Mr Fahim was absent from Mr Karzai 's press conference .
The president said he was "" sorry "" that the defence minister was not there , but went on to praise him as "" our brother "" and "" a great warrior "" .
Mr Karzai is widely expected to win the election .
Among 20 contenders , his closest rival is thought to be General Abdul Rashid Dostum , an ethnic Uzbek warlord and former Northern Alliance leader .
Last week , an aide to Gen Dostum said Mr Karzai could lose the election because fewer people had registered to vote in the Pashtun heartlands due to threats of violence , and customs discouraging women from taking part in elections .
Mr Karzai 's government remains dominated by militia commanders such as Gen Dostum and Mr Fahim , who was made defence minister after commanding the Northern Alliance forces which helped the US to topple the Taliban in late 2001 .
However , Mr Fahim has failed to deliver on pledges to disarm the factions that still control much of the country .
His allies hold powerful positions in each of the country 's four main provincial cities .
Gen Dostum has also refused to hand over some of his heavy weapons to the government in Kabul .
He says the government 's disarmament plan should cover the south and east of the country , where Islamist militants and Taliban hardliners remain active ."

2004-08-11,"Donald Rumsfeld , the US defence secretary , today arrived in Afghanistan for talks with the country 's president , Hamid Karzai , ahead of the presidential election on October 9 .
Hours before his arrival , Mr Rumsfeld told reporters in Oman that al - Qaida and the ousted Taliban would attempt to sabotage the polls , but said they would not succeed .
His first stop on the one - day visit was in the eastern city of Jalalabad , where he visited US and Afghan troops and saw a US - led reconstruction project . ""
This country 's doing well .
You folks are doing well , "" he told the soldiers .
Eighteen Afghans , including Mr Karzai , were yesterday announced as candidates for the presidential vote .
A UN - Afghan election body cut out five candidates considered to be unqualified , but the inclusion of three warlords on the list has attracted complaints from human rights groups .
Zakim Shah , the head of the joint commission , said that it had received 115 complaints against the candidates , including allegations of plunder , murder , rape , crimes against humanity and crimes against national unity .
More than nine million people out of 10 million eligible voters have registered to vote , and the candidates include : Hamid Karzai : Appointed Afghanistan 's first post - Taliban president at the loya jirga .
His closeness to the US can create unpopularity , especially among his own Pashtuns , but he is the most likely winner .
Massouda Jalal :
The only female candidate on the list .
She came a distant second to Mr Karzai at the loya jirga .
Abdul Rashid Dostum :
A ruthless Uzbek warlord , he has a reputation as a serial betrayer , having allied himself with almost every Afghan leader of the past two decades .
He fought both with and against the Soviets in the 80s , and with the Taliban until joining the Northern Alliance , which helped the US to oust them in late 2001 .
Karim Khalili : One of Mr Karzai 's running mates .
Yunus Qanuni : The current education minister , and Mr Karzai 's stongest challenger .
He has the backing of the foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , and the defence minister , Mohammed Fahim ( who was recently dropped by Mr Karzai as a vice - presidential candidate ) .
All three are Tajiks - the country 's second largest ethnic group - and were leaders in the Northern Alliance .
Mohammed Mohaqeq : Leader of the Persian - speaking Shia Hazaras of central Afghanistan .
The election has been delayed since June , partly because of the slow pace of the disarmament of factional forces and increasing violence .
Almost 1,000 people have been killed over the past year in the bloodiest violence since the Taliban 's fall .
Mr Rumsfeld said there had been a campaign of intimidation to dissuade people from registering to vote , but described the high registration levels as "" a very vivid demonstration of the Aghan people 's determination to make democracy work "" .
"" This upcoming election is an important one , "" he said .
"" When we talked a few months ago , the hope was three , four , maybe five million registered voters .
I 'm told by the joint election commission today , they claim something like nine million , of which a sizeable portion is women . ""
Mr Karzai is the US 's preferred candidate , but Mr Rumsfeld and other officials have avoided endorsing him , saying that Washington would work with whoever Afghan voters elect ."
2004-08-25,"There was only one message on the banners and posters dotted around Islamabad 's streets as the motorcade whizzed past amid tight security : "" Pakistan welcomes Hamid Karzai "" .
But the warm greeting belied the sensitivity of the moment for the interim Afghan leader and his host , President Pervez Musharraf .
Mr Karzai is worried about Taliban insurgents , who are threatening to upset next month 's presidential elections .
Many are thought to use Pakistan as a base .
General Musharraf offered his unqualified help .
"" Anybody trying to disrupt the election process ... will not be allowed from Pakistan .
We will act against them , "" he vowed .
These days Gen Musharraf 's promises carry extra weight , following a six - week drive against al - Qaida in Pakistan .
From the back - streets of Karachi to the tribal highlands , his security services have prosecuted an unrelenting campaign against Osama bin Laden 's network .
Hardly a day passes without the announcement of fresh arrests , foiled bomb plots , or military operations along the Afghan border .
So far the security services - invigorated by a wave of suicide attacks on government and army figures - have detained over 70 suspected militants .
They include Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani , a Tanzanian wanted in connection with the 1998 US embassy bombings in east Africa , and Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan , a Pakistani computer expert whose plans for new attacks sparked alerts in London , New York and New Jersey .
Britain and the US are delighted with the sweep , which has burnished Gen Musharraf 's standing as a central strategic ally .
But they also admit that beneath the successes of the Pakistani army lies an underbelly rooted in its long - standing links with Islamic extremism .
Many of the suspects being rounded up were originally recruited by the ISI , the army 's intelligence service , to fight in Kashmir or Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s .
Now cut adrift from Pakistan , many have found a calling in al - Qaida .
It is unclear whether some of their handlers have gone with them . ""
It 's great having a savage dog that attacks other people , "" said a diplomat , "" but not if it turns on you . ""
In the past week suspected hideouts have been bombed in the mountains and forests of South Waziristan , where militants are sheltering under the protection of tribesmen .
There is also frequent speculation that Bin Laden or his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahri , are hiding in the same area .
Last week Gen Musharraf 's government published a "" wanted "" poster for its six most wanted militants , offering rewards of up to $ 340,000 per head .
The highest price was offered for Abu Faraj Farj , a Libyan , who is suspected to have coordinated much al - Qaida activity in Pakistan .
The hunt for suspects appears to have encouraged police brutality .
Last week a radical cleric , Qari Noor Mohammed , died in custody after a raid on an Islamic school in Faisalabad .
Police said Mr Mohammed suffered a heart attack ; human rights activists said he had been tortured .
In response , al - Qaida has transformed its tactics .
Having long considered Pakistan as a rear base , it has now turned its sights on the violent overthrow of the Pakistani state .
In the past year suicide bombers have nearly succeeded in killing Gen Musharraf , an army commander , and Shaukat Aziz , due to be appointed prime minister this week .
Last weekend the security services claimed they had foiled a plot to blow up the national convention centre , Gen Musharraf 's house and the US embassy .
But although outsiders are thought to have coordinated the terror operations , Pakistani militants have provided the manpower .
Many are drawn from radical Islamic groups once nurtured by the ISI .
They include Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , a sectarian Sunni group that fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan , and Harkatul Mujahideen , which has supported the Pakistan army in its war with India .
Not only have the militants turned against the Pakistani state , but diplomats worry that some of their handlers - mid- to low - level intelligence operatives - have not shed all their ties .
"" There 's a lot of dirty laundry , "" said one .
"" If you have spent 15 years running Jihadis in Kashmir and Afghanistan , and then one day someone tells you to stop - it 's very difficult . ""
The army denies any such fissures persist .
"" This is a professional army where orders are followed .
Anyone who refuses to do so will get his ass kicked , "" said Major General Shaukat Sultan .
Analysts say the army is struggling with the product of its longstanding association with Islamists .
"" I think we are reaping what we sowed in the 1970s and 1980s , "" said Talat Masood , a retired general .
""
The process of the militarisation of society , strengthening the forces of radicalism - has come back to haunt us .
The militants are also being drawn from less traditional strands .
In contrast with the Islamists , who mainly come from poor backgrounds , computer expert Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan was a qualified engineer from a middle class Karachi family who had studied at City University , London ."
2004-09-13,"Riots erupted yesterday in the western Afghan capital , Herat , killing at least seven people , after the interim president , Hamid Karzai , moved to wrest the city from its warlord ruler .
Afghan soldiers opened fire on a stone - throwing mob that stormed UN offices in protest at Ismail Khan 's dismissal as the city 's governor , destroying vehicles and burning offices .
US helicopters hovered over the city , which was under curfew last night , as plumes of smoke rose from the burning UN buildings .
The announcement followed an appeal by Mr Khan for restraint .
A hospital doctor said seven people died , while the interior ministry confirmed that there were 12 injuries .
Some protesters said they were shot at by US troops supporting the newly trained Afghan national army .
The violence was ignited by a bold gambit by Mr Karzai , a month before the October 9 presidential election .
On Saturday he dismissed Mr Khan as governor of Herat by announcing his "" promotion "" to minister of mines - an offer the warlord spurned , saying that he preferred to remain a "" private citizen "" .
The atmosphere in the city heated rapidly .
Two American soldiers had to be rescued from a stone - throwing mob .
The manoeuvring is part of a long - running tussle between Mr Khan , a legendary mujahideen leader , and the central government in Kabul .
The warlord has frustrated several attempts to woo him from his personal fiefdom to a ministerial position in Kabul .
He prefers to remain in Herat , where he controls a considerable personal army as well as the multimillion - pound border trade with Iran .
However , a number of defeats this year appear to signal his growing military weakness .
His son , the civil aviation minister , Mirwais Sadi , died in a clash with government troops in April , and last month forces loyal to his bitter rival , Amanullah Khan , fought to within 20 miles of Herat .
The governor was embarrassed into accepting the intervention of Afghan army and US troops to save the city - a force now being used to enforce the political coup against him .
Yesterday US helicopters hovered over Herat , days after Mr Karzai vowed to rein in renegade warlords as part of his manifesto for the presidential election .
About 10 UN staff scrambled into a bunker on their compound and were later evacuated to a small US military base in the city .
The offices of a Danish aid agency were also ransacked by the rioters .
The US ambassador , Zalmay Khalilzad , said he had spoken to Mr Khan , urging him not to threaten security .
Meanwhile , Herat 's newly appointed governor , Sayed Muhammad Khairkhwa , formerly Afghan ambassador to Ukraine , flew into the city 's airport .
The UN special envoy , Jean Arnault , said Mr Khairkhwa 's appointment would ensure the "" peaceful preparation of the elections "" .
The city was under curfew last night .
State - run Herat TV broadcast an announcement from the army commander warning that "" any disorder will face military action "" and gatherings were forbidden , Reuters reported .
The announcement was preceded by a statement from Mr Khan calling for restraint by protesters and the army ."
2004-09-16,"Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , yesterday evaded an apparent assassination attempt , when a rocket attack missed his helicopter .
President Karzai was on an official trip to a school opening in Gardez , south of the capital , Kabul .
A US military spokesman , Major Mark McCann , said one rocket was fired as the helicopter was landing , hitting the ground 300 m away .
"" The president did not appear to be in any danger , "" he said .
The presidential security team , which includes an army of American private security consultants flanking the president everywhere he goes , quickly aborted the landing and rushed Mr Karzai back to Kabul .
Mr Karzai 's spokesman , Khaleeq Ahmed , said the president had felt that the move was an over - reaction and was "" very disappointed "" not to be able to visit the school as planned .
President Karzai has rarely been seen outside the presidential palace since an assassination attempt two years ago in Kandahar .
But during the current presidential campaign , he has been attending more official events , in an attempt to heighten his public profile before the October 9 election ."
2004-09-19,"Bono , the lead singer of U2 , is to appear as the star speaker at this year 's Labour conference .
The rock icon and global activist will be the latest in a string of celebrity guests to grace the annual event ; others to have spoken include Nelson Mandela in 2000 and Bill Clinton in 2002 and , last year , the president of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai .
Bono has already taken time off from recording U2 's new album to bring his campaign about Aids and the burden of debt in Africa to both the Democrat and Republican conventions in Boston and New York .
He will deliver his speech on the Wednesday of the conference .
As its name suggests , his organisation , Debt , Aids , Trade Africa ( DATA ) pursues campaigns on African issues : unpayable debts , Aids and inequitable trade rules .
DATA was set up in 2002 by Bono and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign .
Its aim is to use celebrity influence to persuade politicians from Europe , the US and the Far East to shift resources into Africa .
Bono , Bob Geldof and the comedian Chris Tucker , star of the Rush Hour movies , have already toured Africa on behalf of the campaign .
The actress Ashley Judd , the billionaire investor Warren Buffett and the champion cyclist Lance Armstrong have supported the campaign in the United States .
In July DATA welcomed the British Government 's decision , announced in Gordon Brown 's comprehensive spending review , to increase its contribution to the global fight against Aids .
The UK 's overall contribution to the war on HIV / Aids will increase from £ 300 m a year to £ 550 m annually by 2007/08 .
The Government also announced £ 150 m over three years to support Aids orphans .
Last week the US Senate Appropriations Committee approved $ 2.4bn ( £ 1.35bn ) of spending to combat Aids , malaria and tuberculosis , mostly in Africa .
Bono told the Fox TV chatshow host Bill O'Reilly earlier this month that he was visiting both US political conventions because he was a ' non - partisan guy ' .
It is understood that the rock star has not been invited to either the Liberal Democrat or Conservative conferences .
DATA has also called for action in the Darfur region of Sudan , where it is estimated that 30,000 people have been killed by government - backed militias and more than a million refugees displaced .
This week Bono will back a new campaign called Make Poverty History . '
2005 is our chance to go down in history for what we did do , rather than for what we did n't do , ' he said of the campaign .
U2 's new album , How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb , will be released in November ."
2004-10-06,"Hamid Karzai 's running mate in the Afghan presidential election narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by the Taliban yesterday in the latest bid to derail Saturday 's poll .
A roadside bomb exploded as a convoy carrying Ahmed Zia Massoud passed in the north - eastern city of Faizabad , not normally known for insurgent attacks .
Mr Massoud , the brother of Ahmed Shah Massoud , the Northern Alliance leader who was assasinated in September 2001 , escaped unhurt but one person was killed and five injured , including a former provincial governor .
A Taliban official told Reuters a remote - controlled bomb missed Mr Massoud 's car because "" it went off too late "" .
The Taliban have vowed to disrupt the election through violence and intimidation but have so far failed .
Mr Karzai , the interim leader and runaway favourite , has remained under tight security , rarely venturing into public after a Taliban rocket almost brought down his helicopter three weeks ago .
As campaigning ended yesterday he held only his second rally at a Kabul sports stadium .
Urging Afghans to vote , no matter for which candidate , he told a crowd of thousands that "" your vote will lay the first brick in the wall of democracy "" .
"" You have shown yourselves to be heroes versus the Soviet Union and terrorists , "" he said .
"" Now show yourselves to be heroes of the vote . ""
Mr Karzai 's bid for the presidency received a minor boost when one of the lesser known candidates , Abdul Haseeb Aryan , withdrew .
Higher - profile candidates such as the former education minister Yunus Qanooni have so far defied predictions they would drop out in exchange for promises of cabinet seats .
Mr Qanooni is linked to the defence minister , Muhammad Fahim , an ethnic Tajik whom Mr Karzai dropped as his deputy in favour of Mr Massoud .
Yesterday 's attack took place in Badakhshan province , a mountainous area of extensive poppy cultivation , but not normally a centre of Taliban activity ."
2004-10-08,"This is not going to be a simple , straightforward election , is it ?
It is not : the Taliban are threatening bombings , the warlords might try to rig some of the voting , much of the electorate is illiterate and has never voted before , and roads and communications are poor over the vast terrain .
The candidate expected to win is the current , unelected transitional president , Hamid Karzai , who has been more or less holed up in his secure compound in the capital , Kabul , after coming under fire on a helicopter trip last month .
Mr Karzai 's 17 rival candidates - an ethnically diverse group - include warlords with some very questionable backgrounds in terms of human rights , one woman , and a poet , Latif Pedram .
The UN estimates 90 % of the Afghan electorate may vote , with about 40 % of the voters being women .
But it has encountered an anomaly : the UN thinks 9.5 million people are eligible to vote , but eyebrows were arched after 10.5 million actually registered .
During polling , hands will be inked to try and stop multiple voting .
That is because in modern Afghanistan , some of the solutions still have to be low tech .
The UN organisers of the vote have hired 5,000 mobile phones , 1,150 Russian jeeps , four helicopters and a cargo plane but also some 300 donkeys .
And it will be by donkey that the ballot box from one polling station in the Hindu Kush mountains will be delivered - two weeks after the polls have closed .
Official electoral monitors are only several hundred strong , and the legwork manning and returning ballot boxes from the 22,000 polling stations will be done by the 114,000 local staff hired by the UN , which is spending £ 111 m on the election .
David Avery , who is in charge of the UN 's joint electoral management body , admitted that not every ballot box was going to make it .
He told the Guardian : "" In the end , you count what you get .
"" It is hoped that most Afghans will enjoy their taste of democracy .
Will the election be fair ?
There has been widespread violence against election officials , and a dozen election workers have so far been killed in shootings and bombings .
US and Nato troops are patrolling the capital and countryside , leaving it to thousands of newly trained Afghan national police and army troops to guard candidates and polling stations .
A UN report warned that local warlords could use guns to intimidate both voters and candidates .
It also suggested that a lack of information and understanding about how the elections work , especially in rural areas , where many people are illiterate , could hinder a fair outcome .
How bad is the security situation ?
More than 1,000 people have died in violence over the last year , making it the deadliest since the US - led invasion ousted the Taliban .
Mr Karzai postponed the presidential election - originally scheduled to take place in June - until October , and the parliamentary elections until next spring in order to avoid voters being frightened from the polls by bloodshed .
The Taliban has vowed to step up attacks ahead of the election , and on August 30 a car bomb ripped through the offices of a US security company in Kabul , killing 10 people .
The Pakistani president , Pervez Musharaff , has promised to stop the remnants of the Taliban launching raids into Afghanistan from bases inside Pakistan , but Afghan leaders say this is still happening .
In September 2002 , Mr Karzai survived an assassination attempt in the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar .
Several organisations , including Médecins sans Frontières , have withdrawn from Afghanistan following unprecedented attacks on aid workers .
On Wednesday October 6 , just three days before the polls open , a convoy carrying Mr Karzai 's vice - presidential running mate , Ahmed Zia Massood , was attacked by a roadside bomb .
Mr Massood was unharmed but one man died .
How does it work and who are the main candidates ?
Voters will choose between 18 candidates for a five - year term of office .
If none of those candidates wins a simple majority , a run - off election in November will determine a final winner .
The main candidates are : · Hamid Karzai .
The transitional president was appointed in 2002 by the loya jirga ( grand assembly ) .
He speaks several Afghan languages and comes from the country 's largest ethnic group , the Pashtun .
However , the country 's security situation is dire : opium production has exploded , and most Afghans live in abject poverty and have little access to healthcare .
However , voters may not have expected Mr Karzai to solve in only three years the problems caused by almost three decades of war .
Afghanistan also needs foreign funds , and his urbane dignity goes down well with international donors .
· Yunus Qanuni .
Mr Karzai 's education minister , is best placed to defeat him at the polls .
Mr Qanuni served as a the leader of the anti - Taliban Northern Alliance and is a member of the country 's second largest ethnic group , the Tajiks .
He has two powerful backers in Mr Karzai 's defence minister , Mohammed Fahim , and the former foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah . ·
Massouda Jalal .
The only female candidate on the list , Ms Jalal is a former UN worker and a qualified paediatrician .
She is independent of any faction , but that means she lacks a power base .
She came a distant second to Mr Karzai at the loya jirga in 2002 . · Mohammed Mohaqeq .
Formerly an anti - Taliban militia commander , Mr Mohaqeq is from the long - suffering Shia Muslim Hazara minority of central Afghanistan .
He served as planning minister in Mr Karzai 's government until March , when he insists he was ejected from the cabinet because of his candidacy .
He could overshadow Mr Karzai 's less popular Hazara vice - presidential nominee . ·
Abdul Rashid Dostum .
A ruthless Uzbek warlord , he has a reputation as a serial betrayer , having allied himself with almost every Afghan leader over the past two decades .
He fought both with and against the Soviets during the 1980s , and with the Taliban until joining the Northern Alliance , which helped the US oust its regime in late 2001 .
· Abdul Satar Serat .
An Uzbek and a former aide to Afghanistan 's last king , Mr Serat has spent most of the past 30 years in exile .
Many believed that the intellectual nationalist would head up the post - Taliban interim government , but Mr Karzai , backed by the US , took the post . ·
Abdul Hafiz Mansoor .
The traditionalist former head of Aghan state television , Mr Mansoor put on a rabble - rousing display at the loya jirga , which passed Afghanistan 's new constitution in January .
He has links with the Tajik faction in the anti - Taliban Northern Alliance and has accused Mr Karzai of attempting to install an elected dictatorship .
He stirred up anger by ordering a ban on women singing on air .
Will the winner actually control the country ?
Some of Mr Karzai 's opponents refer to him derisively as the "" mayor of Kabul "" .
He has not taken on the warlords , who have largely refused to disarm , but has instead negotiated alliances with them .
Any new president will have the backing of around 18,000 US - led troops and 8,000 Nato - led peacekeepers .
Disarming regional factions , however , remains the key to creating a single country under a central government .
An estimated 50,000 armed militia members are attached to warlords across the country .
By contrast , the fledgling Afghan national army , controlled by the president , has 14,000 troops .
The country 's infrastructure has also been reduced to rubble by decades of fighting that have cut off one area of the country from another ."
2004-10-10,"Chaos was enveloping Afghanistan 's fragile presidential election last night after all 15 candidates challenging Hamid Karzai declared they were boycotting the poll over alleged voter fraud .
UN and Afghan officials rejected the call , insisting that difficulties involving indelible ink did not warrant abandoning the historic vote .
The controversy surfaced within hours of polls opening yesterday morning , when voters in several areas complained that ink used by election officials to stain people 's fingers - to prevent multiple voting - easily rubbed off .
The possibility of fraud has dogged the Afghan election since thousands registered to vote several times , thinking their vote cards would bring them money or free food . '
This vote is a fraud , ' said Abdul Satar Sirat , the Uzbek candidate who rallied the complainants .
' It should be stopped .
We do n't recognise the results . '
But officials with the joint UN - Afghan body organising the poll rejected the call . '
Halting the vote at this stage is unjustified and would deny these people their right to vote , ' said vice - chairman Ray Kennedy .
The election cost $ 20 m to organise and at least 12 Afghan officials have been murdered by the Taliban .
The UN focused the blame on poorly - trained officials who , they said , had used an ink intended to mark ballot papers - instead of the indelible one - as the anti - fraud device .
But millions of Afghans still flooded to the polls , bringing with them hopes that the ballot box would mark the closing chapter of a 25-year saga of bloodshed , war and suffering .
At 7.55am , 70-year - old Mohammed Zaffar cast his vote in the battered village of Chuquri , which has seen a century 's worth of battles .
British colonists , Soviet soldiers and black - turbaned Taliban have marched , bombed or shot their way through this mud - walled , hilltop hamlet . '
I prayed , had breakfast and came here .
I thought about who to vote for on the way , ' explained Zaffar .
Behind him , a trickle of men braved the sharp morning chill to enter the barbed wire voting enclosure .
Some arrived by donkey , others drove herds of sheep .
Over 100,000 US , Nato - led and Afghan security forces had been placed on high alert across the country as voters streamed into bombed - out schools , health clinics and mosques to choose among 16 candidates , of whom the favourite was the charismatic interim president Karzai .
But celebration bells were muted by the eruption of the fraud row that could yet scupper the vote .
Despite repeated threats of violence Taliban insurgents failed to terrorise the vote , although there were several foiled attacks - on Friday a bomb - sniffing dog discovered a petrol tanker laden with 40,000 litres of fuel , rigged with anti - tank mines , and intended for detonation in Kandahar , a Defence Ministry spokesman said .
But while some stations were crowded , others were virtually empty .
Polling got off to a sluggish start at rural stations like Chuquri where , 90 minutes after voting started , only about 60 men and no women had voted . '
They will come later .
Some people have to walk for hours to arrive , and the weather is very cold , ' predicted returning officer Dr Muhammad Zahir .
But fear may have also been a factor .
Taliban had posted ' night letters ' in Chuquri the night before , threatening to fire rockets into the booths .
Inexperience and bias also affected the poll .
The Chuquri station opened late while officials struggled to position polling booths and set up registration tables .
Zahir , who openly announced his preference for Karzai , accompanied several older voters inside the curtained booth . '
They can not read or write so I am just showing them the photos , ' he explained .
In Kabul a dust storm on Friday blanketed the capital in a thick haze seen by some as an ill omen .
But the interim president Karzai maintained an upbeat tone . '
It is not important who wins , ' he said as he cast his vote under tight security in the prime minister 's office . '
The people are choosing their destiny and eventually if I win or any other one , the victory will be of the Afghan people . '
As polls started to close at around 4 pm yesterday , most of the political focus was on the controversy over ink and possible fraud .
Abdul Wahab , 45 , sat with other disabled voters outside the Maraston Hostel in Kabul for war - wounded or widowed families .
Wahab , who lost a leg stepping on a landmine five years ago , hobbled across a busy road on a pair of crutches to cast his vote .
Like many , he refused to disclose his preference , but stressed he was banking on the election to pull his country out of the chaos wrought by Soviet occupation , the Taliban and then the US invasion after 11 September . '
Now people realise we have to use a pen instead of a gun .
That 's the new fight , ' he said , pointing to his 12-year - old son Qais . '
Look at him .
He was born in war .
Now I want a bright future for him . '"
2004-10-11,"An opposition boycott of Afghanistan 's presidential election appeared to be cracking yesterday as local and international observers declared the vote prone to blunders but generally fair .
Mohammed Mohaqeq , a high profile challenger to the interim president , Hamid Karzai , said he no longer supported the boycott announced on Saturday by all 15 opposition candidates , who claimed there had been widespread voter fraud .
"" There is no question of a boycott , "" he told about 1,000 supporters at a mosque in western Kabul .
The US ambassador , Zalmay Khalilzad , shuttled between other candidates to persuade them to follow Mr Mohaqeq 's example as the counting of the votes started in eight tightly guarded centres .
Another candidate , Abdul Hadi Dabir , said some had already changed their minds .
Meanwhile , a joint UN - Afghan election body announced an independent inquiry into claims of fraud .
The controversy marred an otherwise peaceful election that saw millions of Afghans participate in what they hoped would end a quarter of a century of violent chaos .
In an initial assessment , the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan ( Fefa ) said that despite many errors and some deliberate rigging the poll was largely successful .
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation of Europe , which deployed 40 experts , gave a similar verdict .
The fraud allegations emerged after just a few hours of polling , when voters complained that what was supposed to be indelible ink , used to prevent multiple voting , could be easily rubbed off .
Naseem , a hotel waiter in Kabul , held out a spotlessly clean hand that he said had been inked at a polling station an hour earlier .
"" I just washed it away , "" he said .
The scale of the problem remained unclear yesterday .
UN officials blamed inexperienced election workers , who had used the wrong ink .
But observers said the organisers were also at fault because some of the correct ink had dried up or was not indelible .
Fefa called for an investigation into the irregularities , which also included allegations that some poll workers directed voters how to vote .
The election marked a setback for the Taliban , which managed just a few skirmishes and landmine attacks on polling days . ""
The Taliban made very limited attacks , "" the US commander , Lt Gen David Barno , told Associated Press . ""
Yesterday was a huge defeat for the Taliban . ""
The insurgent force had issued warnings of bombings , beatings and rocket attacks .
But millions of Afghans were undeterred , flooding into bullet - pocked schools , mosques and clinics to cast their ballot .
One official with the peacekeeping force said a line of voters had had to scatter after a rocket exploded in Jalalabad .
But after a few moments , they had returned to the queue and voted .
Some voters saw the opposition boycott as a ploy by poor losers .
"" This was like an exam for them , and they have failed , "" said Saleh Muhammad , 64 , a shopkeeper in western Kabul .
He said he kept a Mohaqeq poster in his window to avoid harassment , but had voted for Mr Karzai .
First figures were due late last night , but a spokesman said a result might take another week ."
2004-10-12,"Afghanistan 's election crisis seemed to be over yesterday when the main opposition challenger , Yunus Qanooni , withdrew his threat to boycott the result .
His decision cleared the way for the votes to be counted .
An American - conducted exit poll has predicted a handsome margin of victory for the interim president , Hamid Karzai .
Mr Qanooni plunged the election into chaos on Saturday when he led 14 other candidates in declaring the poll illegitimate because of allegations of possible fraud .
An indelible ink system designed to prevent multiple voting proved faulty - some voters washed the ink from their hands easily - provoking the suggestion that the election would have to be held again .
But yesterday Mr Qanooni withdrew and said he had agreed to make his complaints to an investigation by the electoral body run by the Afghan government and the UN .
The ethnic Hazara leader Mohammed Mohaqeq and the only woman candidate , Massouda Jalal , had already backed out .
Others are expected to follow suit .
"" I do n't want to be against the election and I appreciate the goodwill of the people of Afghanistan , "" Mr Qanooni said .
His chance of being elected was low , according to the preliminary findings of the election 's only exit poll , by the International Republican Institute , which predicted that Mr Karzai would win enough votes to avoid a run - off against Mr Qanooni .
The IRI , which is linked to the Republican party , said more than 10,000 voters in 26 of Afghanistan 's 38 provinces had been questioned .
The poll was paid for by the US government agency USAid .
President George Bush is keen to demonstrate that Afghanistan is a foreign policy success during next month 's US election , particularly against the backdrop of Iraq .
The defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , speaking in Macedonia , said the media had played up the negative aspects of the election.""The fact is they just had an election .
It 's breathtaking ! ""
he said .
Observers said the election , in which millions of Afghans ignored threats of Taliban violence to go to the polls , was imperfect because of official blunders , inexperience and some reported vote rigging .
But in general , they said , it was an inspiring experience .
"" It 's easy to be cynical
but I thought it was a really amazing day , "" a diplomat said .
The IRI exit poll was condemned by some European countries , which had earlier agreed not to conduct exit polls .
"" We were concerned that if you started asking Afghans who they voted for , they might lose confidence in the secrecy of the ballot , "" a diplomat said last night .
But it may be the only indication of the result for several days .
With ballot boxes being transported from remote mountainous areas by road , helicopter and mule , counting is not due to begin until tomorrow at the earliest .
Officials said it could take up to a week to produce the first significant results , and the final tally should not be expected before October 30 ."

2004-10-24,"The interim leader Hamid Karzai coasted towards victory in Afghanistan 's presidential election yesterday when his share of the vote passed the 50 % mark .
With 94 % of the vote counted he had 4.2 m of the estimated 8.2 m ballots cast : enough to avoid a run - off against his nearest rival Yunus Qanooni , who trailed a distant second with 1.2 m votes .
A spokesman for Mr Qanooni conceded defeat last night , according to Reuters , but official confirmation of Mr Karzai 's victory was frozen pending the outcome of an investigation into alleged polling irregularities .
The inquiry , now confined to 12 disputed ballot boxes , is unlikely to affect the final result . ""
The result looks mathematically certain , but we ca n't say anything official yet , "" Reginald Austin , chief technical adviser to the joint UN - Afghan election body , said .
Although marred by blunders and fraud allegations , the election , held on October 9 , was hailed as a watershed after a quarter of a century of violent chaos .
Millions of mostly illiterate Afghans braved threats of violence or harsh weather to cast their first vote .
But the mood of relief was dampened on Saturday by a Taliban suicide bombing on a busy Kabul street which killed two civilians and injured three peacekeepers .
The bomber , disguised as a beggar , struck on Chicken Street , which is lined with rug and antique shops , apparently aiming at a jeep of soldiers from the Nato - led Isaf peacekeeping mission .
A 23-year - old American translator and an 11-year - old Afghan girl were killed .
Three Icelandic soldiers , one seriously injured , were taken to hospital .
The attack dented the hope that the Taliban 's failure to disrupt the poll marked a decline in the insurgency .
Security analysts said the amateurish nature of the attack - the bomber managed to explode only three of the six grenades attached to him - showed that the fundamentalists remained a weakened force .
The vote count , which began 12 days ago , is expected to end today when the last ballots from Pakistan and a few remote provinces are tallied .
If confirmed as victor , Mr Karzai will have a five - year mandate to help him shake off the jibe that he is a mere puppet of his American supporters .
An ethnic Pashtun , he was appointed interim president after the US - led invasion deposed the Taliban regime in late 2001 .
The successful poll will also reverberate in the US , where President George Bush is portraying Afghanistan in his re- election campaign as a foreign policy success .
But Afghanistan 's transition to democracy remains fragile and incomplete .
The voting patterns suggest that it remains divided by the ethnic hostilities which have fed much of the recent conflict .
Mr Qanooni relied heavily on his fellow Tajik for votes .
Similarly , the third and fourth placed candidates , the warlords Abdul Rashid Dostum and Mohammed Mohaqeq , relied on their Uzbek and Hazara constituencies .
So far Mr Karzai has employed a policy of appeasement towards the warlords , who control much of the country outside Kabul .
Many voters now expect him to adopt a more forceful approach .
The other tasks facing him include disarming an estimated 40,000 gunmen , preparing for next April 's parliamentary elections , and combating the increasingly pervasive influence of drug money .
Afghanistan is expected to record a bumper opium harvest this year , and officials ranging from regional governors to police chiefs are expected to benefit .
Allegations against one of Mr Karzai 's relatives , rumoured to be a big heroin smuggler , are coursing through Kabul 's diplomatic circles .
If they are proved , Mr Karzai could be damaged ."
2004-10-24,"Hanging chads troubled George Bush in the 2000 election in Florida , while Hamid Karzai , the now nearly official winner of Afghanistan 's presidential poll , faced difficulties with imperfect indelible ink that was feared could mean multiple voting .
Happily for Mr Karzai - and for his enthusiastic backer in the White House - the problem has been resolved and the Afghan result seems all but certain .
Mr Karzai 's rival , the ethnic Tajik Yunus Qanuni , conceded defeat yesterday , guaranteeing the Pashtun favourite a simple majority large enough to avoid a destabilising second ballot .
The stage is thus set for a five - year term for a man whose dignity and self - assurance in tackling the horrendous problems of his war - ravaged land has won him plaudits across the world .
Overall , Afghanistan had a remarkably free election for a vast country with poor communications where much of the electorate is illiterate and hundreds of donkeys were needed to reach remote polling stations .
How fair it was remains an open question , with reports of official blunders and some ballot - stuffing and multiple voting .
Intimidation may have been far more widespread than has been reported by the few foreign observers on hand .
And when 15 presidential candidates withdrew in protest because of the row over the non - indelible ink - used to make thumbprints on ballot papers - they were quickly persuaded to change their minds by the US ambassador , who is known as "" the viceroy "" .
Afghanistan 's speedy transition to democracy matters very much to Mr Bush - especially because of the deepening mayhem in Iraq .
Many believe the US has pushed too far , too fast , for its own selfish reasons .
But that does not mean that significant progress , recognised by Afghans choosing their leader for the first time ever , should be underestimated .
Thankfully , the poll also took place without the widespread violence that had been feared - though a rare suicide bomb attack in central Kabul yesterday claimed the lives of an American woman and an Afghan girl .
Until now , security forces have been relatively successful in subduing the Taliban threat and have reduced militants to launching sporadic rocket attacks and roadside bombs in the outlying southern provinces where the insurgency is strongest .
Still , though , Mr Karzai had to spend much of the election campaign holed up in his secure compound in Kabul after a missile attack on his helicopter .
Such dangers will not disappear magically overnight .
Security , in fact , is by far the biggest single problem facing the country - just as it is in Iraq - largely because the US and its allies , and Mr Karzai 's interim government , have failed to disarm the powerful warlords .
Nato , whose members agreed on Afghanistan while splitting over Iraq , has also failed dismally to meet its own pledges and move its troops in significant numbers to the west and south and help extend the reach of central government .
The Americans , still fighting alone , will have to do more than hunt Taliban and al - Qaida remnants on the mountainous border with Pakistan .
Mr Karzai , who is widely seen as Washington 's man , has probably won a strong enough mandate to allow him to improve his credentials as leader to all of Afghanistan 's ethnic groups , which picked their candidates backed by regional militias , and in some cases drug money , for the top job in Kabul .
But he will need to achieve a huge amount and avoid too many compromises in choosing his cabinet and provincial governors - especially shunning men who control private armies - if the parliamentary elections scheduled for next spring are to succeed .
His victory should act as a spur to those foreign governments that have radiated goodwill towards this tragic country but have done too little to translate it into effective action ."
2004-10-25,"President Hamid Karzai has won the majority of votes in the Afghan election , securing over 55 % and paving for the way for him to become the country 's first popularly elected president .
Results posted on the website of the Joint Electoral Management Board ( JESB ) - an Afghan and United Nations election commission - showed Mr Karzai way ahead with 55.3 % of the vote while his nearest rival , former education minister Yonous Qanooni secured only 16.2 % With nearly 95 % of votes counted , the interim leader already has more than half the estimated 8.1 m votes cast .
Under election rules , a candidate must secure 50 % plus one vote to win .
A spokesman for Mr Qanooni conceded defeat last night , according to Reuters , but official confirmation of Karzai 's victory was frozen pending the outcome of an investigation into alleged polling irregularities .
The official result will be announced by the JESB later this week , after it has seen a report into the allegations by an independent .
The three - man panel , made up of a Canadian diplomat and election experts from Britain and Sweden , is due to meet most of the 18 candidates later today to discuss claims of fraud .
The biggest problem was the use of imperfect indelible ink on voters hands , which potentially allowed for multiple voting .
Among the other candidates , Hazara Shia leader Muhammad Mohaqeq received 11.8 % and Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostum had 10.3 % .
The only female presidential candidate , Masooda Jalal , was running sixth , with 80,922 votes , or 1.1 % .
Voting for the historic election began on October 9 , with approximately 22,000 polling stations operational in all districts of Afghanistan 's 34 provinces .
Millions of mostly illiterate Afghans braved threats of violence and harsh weather to cast their first vote .
A European envoy to Afghanistan said that while there has been some flaws , they were not serious enough to affect the actual outcome of the vote . ""
The vote pretty accurately reflects what the people feel , "" Francesc Vendrell , the EU 's special representative , told the BBC .
The JESB has reported that 60 % of votes were cast by women and in some provinces there was a 100 % voter turnout .
In the largest out - of - country voting operation ever , 2,800 polling stations served refugees in Iran and Pakistan .
Mr Karzai has served as interim leader of Afghanistan since the US forces toppled the ruling Taliban regime .
With a likely victory , he will be president for the next five years and his most immediate task will be to prepare for parliamentary elections ."
2004-10-26,"Victory is a formality for Hamid Karzai now .
With only a handful of votes still uncounted in Afghanistan 's historic election , the US - backed leader is streaking ahead of his nearest rival with 55 % of ballots .
The result surprises nobody .
Urbane , charismatic and competent , Mr Karzai wooed billions of dollars in international aid after the US bombed the Taliban from power in 2001 .
Now he has proved the charm sparkles at home too .
Although Mr Karzai 's core support came from fellow Pashtuns , many Afghans , particularly in the cities , voted across ethnic lines .
And despite howls of complaint about vote rigging from his opponents , they now look likely to accept the result .
The poll was also an indirect endorsement of US involvement in Afghanistan where , in contrast with Iraq , Americans are not viewed as an occupying force .
Thousands of miles away President George Bush , desperate for a counterpoint to the Baghdad quagmire , has been crowing on the campaign stump about the glories of Afghanistan .
Meanwhile his military commanders are boasting that the Taliban , who failed to deliver on fiery threats of scuppering the poll , are effectively finished .
Such talk is premature .
Despite the heart - warming tableau of millions of illiterate people queuing to vote , Afghanistan 's democratic transition is far from certain .
A host of rapacious forces - warlords , weapons , and drugs money - are looming large in advance of the real electoral test .
In reality this election , although inspiring , was little more than a Karzai popularity plebiscite against the backdrop of an opposition beauty pageant .
Most voters saw little choice between the modernising incumbent with the powerful US ambassador at his elbow ; and a motley array of warlords , Islamic fundamentalists and varied no - hopers with little hope of bridging divides .
Nevertheless the contest was not entirely theatre .
Though nobody expected to beat Mr Karzai , his nearest contender Yunus Qanooni hoped to push him to a runoff vote .
Warlords more accustomed to directing tank battles sought to stake out their political turf and , in the scramble , quietly efface their bloodstained histories of wartime atrocities .
The parliamentary elections , on the other hand , will present much higher stakes .
Hundreds of candidates , some backed up by warlords , will be running for office .
In a craggy country awash with weapons , that could make for a dangerous contest - unless Mr Karzai acts fast .
His first step will be the appointment of a cabinet .
Until now , Mr Karzai has appeased the warlords , hoping to lure them out of fatigues and into business suits with promises of government jobs .
For example it is widely expected that Ismail Khan , the ' Lion of Heart ' , will be offered a ministerial position .
But civil society , human rights and some government officials say this policy must stop .
They favour shunning the hardmen , arguing it is time for a clean break with the conflict - ridden past .
But the polling figures make the choice less easy for Mr Karzai .
Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum , an ethnic Uzbek , polled a respectable 10 % of votes while Mohammed Mohaqeq , a Hazara hardman , took 12 % .
Having , as they see it , legitimised their positions , the warlords are now expected to lobby hard for government jobs .
They have other bargaining chips too .
Although legally required to sever links with their private armies before the election , warlords like Dostum retain the informal loyalty of thousands of roaming militiamen .
An estimated 40,000 gunmen have skirted demobilisation , a process Mr Karzai is keen to accelerate before the April poll .
So in choosing a cabinet , he may have to balance sidelining the warlord leaders against demobilising their troops .
Karzai also faces a thorny technocratic issue .
In a country where no census has been carried out for decades , the demarcation of about 350 electoral districts remains in dispute .
The boundaries are controversial and are sure to provoke regional disputes .
But to dally in settling them , says UN election adviser Reginald Austin , could have a disastrous effect on preparing for the April poll .
The Taliban factor is more uncertain than ever .
Euphoria at the lack of election violence was dampened by a suicide bombing in Kabul last Saturday that killed one American and two Afghans , one an 11-year - old girl .
Much may depend on the attitude of neighbouring Pakistan , which has publicly allied itself with Karzai yet still tolerates the presence of thousands of Taliban in edgy northern cities such as Quetta and Peshawar .
The coming election may also call the international community 's bluff .
This month¹s poll could have been a disaster .
Only a year ago the UN - led preparations were marred by poor security , lack of funds and a frozen voter registration process .
In the end though , a combination of expert planning and Afghan determination saw it through .
But only a few hundred international observers were deployed to Afghanistan , in contrast with thousands deployed to landmark elections in Cambodia , South Africa and East Timor over the past 11 years .
Next time , it wo n't be so easy .
Observers are crucial .
They help ensure a fair contest , help prevent cheating and make sure gunmen do n't badger voters on their way into the booths .
And although lip service is paid to ' Afghanisation ' of the preparations ­ which is often a figleaf excuse for security concerns - lingering distrust between local politicians means international assistance is key to underwriting the process .
But to assign even one monitor for every two polling centres in Afghanistan would require about 2,500 people , and many more international peacekeepers .
And most of the 18,000 US - led troops are hunting the Taliban or al - Qaida , while about another 9,000 Nato - led soldiers are limited to Kabul and a handful of other cities .
Greater international deployment would be both expensive and dangerous .
But now that Afghanistan has taken its first tentative step to democracy there are few other choices .
Stopping is impossible .
But to perform the job half - heartedly could fatally damage Afghans ' newfound faith in voting .
Either way , it could risk the implosion of an impressive , but still worryingly fragile , achievement ."
2004-10-27,"Your leader ( October 25 ) commented that Hamid Karzai 's victory should act as a spur to foreign governments that have radiated goodwill but have done little to translate it into action .
We agree that more needs to be done to assist Afghanistan .
The UK government has provided assistance across a range of sectors .
We contributed more than £ 13 m to the recent elections , but elections alone do not build a country ; Afghanistan needs help to rebuild its infrastructure if it is to work successfully as a state .
The UK provides assistance to a number of ministries , including £ 2 m to the Ministry of Agriculture - the majority rely on the land for survival .
We are also working with the Afghan government to support rural people through the National Solidarity Programme , which has reached over 5,000 villages .
Through this they have been able to fund the provision of drinking water and irrigation .
In April the UK increased its development assistance to Afghanistan from £ 200 m to £ 500 m between 2002 - 07 .

2004-11-03,"Hamid Karzai was finally declared the winner of Afghanistan 's landmark presidential election today , at the same time as the militants threatening to kill three UN hostages who were in the country to oversee the election pushed back their deadline by 12 hours .
Mr Karzai , the Afghan interim leader , won over 55 % of the vote in the October 9 election and was 39 points ahead of his nearest challenger - enough to avoid a second round .
But an official declaration was put off until today , when investigators determined that a string of irregularities was too minor to overturn the result .
The country 's joint UN - Afghan electoral board therefore confirmed that the American - backed incumbent had clinched a five - year term . ""
His excellency Hamid Karzai is the winner of the election , "" board chairman Zakim Shah said at a ceremony in the capital , Kabul .
"" We are announcing the first elected president of Afghanistan . ""
Meanwhile , Jaish - al Muslimeen - the militant group which claims to have seized the three UN officials in Kabul last Thursday - postponed until midnight ( 1930GMT ) the deadline that it has set for British troops and the UN to leave Afghanistan .
It also demanded that the Afghan government acknowledge it is in talks with the kidnappers .
Akbar Agha , the group 's purported leader , told Associated Press that he had received a call from "" the authorities "" .
"" We will not contact them as it will look as if we are the ones who need talks , "" he said .
"" They will have to approach us . ""
We want the Afghan government and the UN to declare officially that they are in contact with us .
We have set 12 midnight as the deadline . ""
But the Taliban splinter group said it might spare the life of Angelito Nayan , a Filipino diplomat , because his country had no troops in Afghanistan .
"" There will be a death penalty for those who are aggressors , "" Agha said .
"" Britain and Kosovo have troops in Afghanistan , and they are aggressors .
But the Philippines does not have forces so it is not an aggressor country . ""
The group also claims to be holding Annetta Flanigan of Northern Ireland and Shqipe Hebibi of Kosovo .
However , Afghan officials suspect that warlords or criminal groups were also involved in the daylight kidnapping and have launched a search operation in the capital and surrounding countryside .
The Afghan interior ministry has also said its initiatives to secure the hostages ' freedom are progressing , but has denied it is in contact with the kidnappers ."
2004-11-04,"Hamid Karzai was confirmed as Afghanistan 's first elected president yesterday after an international inquiry concluded that a string of irregularities failed to swing the result of the last month 's poll .
Mr Karzai 's win , with 55 % of the vote , will intensify pressure for a crackdown on Afghanistan 's warlord - driven drugs boom .
Britain plays a central role in the war on Afghanistan 's drugs .
The Pashtun leader came to power after the 2001 US - led invasion ordered by George Bush .
But celebrations were soured by an ongoing hostage crisis , involving three UN workers , that underscored the immense challenges facing his still - fragile administration .
Militants holding Annetta Flanigan , from Northern Ireland , and two fellow election officials - a Filipino and a Kosovan - extended their deadline until 2 pm on Friday .
Jaish - e - Muslimeen
( Army of Muslims ) , a Taliban splinter group , is demanding the withdrawal of Britain and the US from Afghanistan , and the release of all Muslim prisoners from Guantánamo Bay , in Cuba .
The delay was granted to allow negotiations with the Afghan government , a militant spokesman said .
After a marathon count of votes , the head of the joint UN - Afghan electoral body announced Mr Karzai 's historic victory "" in the year 1383 "" , referring to the traditional Afghan calendar .
His rival , Yunus Qanooni , who trailed 39 points behind , refused to concede defeat , despite having earlier agreed to abide by the decision of the international monitors , who yesterday concluded that the scale of irregularities could not affect the final result .
Despite threats of Taliban violence , the election passed off largely peacefully .
Sending his congratulations , Tony Blair said it "" demonstrates the scale of the transformation that has taken place in Afghanistan "" .
US state department spokes- man Richard Boucher added : "" Everyone involved has much to be proud of in bringing Afghanistan to this point , just three years after the end of a quarter - century of war and repression . ""
Kofi Annan , the UN secretary general , also congratulated the leader on his mandate .
Now Mr Karzai , armed with a five - year term , must defuse the potentially explosive issues of warlords , weapons and drugs .
"" There is a problem with the rule of law , and so far people have been disappointed , "" said an analyst , Andrew Wilder .
"" Karzai has an opportunity for a reform agenda .
The question is whether he will take it . ""
Known drug smugglers and war criminals were tolerated under the last government - some even won cabinet posts - in the name of national stability .
Moves to curtail the narco - economy were also hindered by the US - led hunt for the Taliban and al - Qaida .
The US military has allied itself with friendly local warlords and turned a blind eye to their drug smuggling and extortion .
A UN report due to be released soon predicts a bumper opium harvest this year , close to the 1999 peak of 4,500 tonnes .
Afghan opium accounts for 95 % of the heroin sold in Europe , and 75 % of world supply .
Illegal drugs have earned Afghanistan $ 2.8bn this year , about half the gross domestic product and more than international aid .
Britain is leading the international anti - drugs drive , with special forces training armed squads to destroy heroin labs while aid programmes entice farmers to switch crops .
But the real challenge for Mr Karzai will be to tackle the politically - connected overlords - widely rumoured to include one of his own relatives .
Before the vote , Mr Karzai moved against some warlords , but others have attempted to legitimise themselves through the ballot box .
The Uzbek strongman General Rashid Dostum and his Hazara counterpart Mohammed Mohaqeq had a combined vote of 22 % ."
2004-11-11,"Taliban - linked militants holding three UN hostages said yesterday that the Afghan government had agreed to free some of their jailed comrades to prevent the killing of the foreign captives .
Afghan state television reported that President Hamid Karzai had decreed the release of prisoners for Eid , the end of Ramadan , on Sunday .
But there was no indication the release would cover any inmates identified by the hostage - takers .
Jaish - e - Muslimeen , or Army of Muslims , is demanding the release of 26 prisoners , 11 of them allegedly held at the US military base at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , if it is to spare the lives of the three foreigners : Shqipe Hebibi of Kosovo , British - Irish Annetta Flanigan , and Philippine diplomat Angelito Nayan .
"" We have been given signals that the prisoners whose release we demand will be freed , "" the group 's leader , Akbar Agha , told the Associated Press in a telephone call .
US military officials in Afghanistan have declined to say whether they will release any suspects .
The visiting US deputy secretary of state , Richard Armitage , said there was little room for manoeuvre and warned that such negotiations could encourage more copying of the kidnap tactics used in Iraq ."
2004-11-22,"Stability and freedom in Afghanistan are part of the prize to be unearthed from the rubble of the post-9/11 world .
Progress is being made under President Hamid Karzai , but US forces are still searching for the remnants of the Taliban and al - Qaida while Nato peacekeepers are thin on the ground .
Much hard nation - building remains to be done .
So it is alarming to see new UN figures showing that production of opium - the raw material for heroin - has hit a record high and is 64 % up on the previous year .
Drugs exports account for over 60 % of the Afghan economy .
No less than 10 % of the population , a staggering 2.3 million people , are involved in a business worth $ 2.8bn a year .
Most of it enriches warlords and corrupt politicians , but it also helps keep a lawless country from falling even further into poverty .
What the experts call an emerging "" narco - state "" provides 87 % of the world 's heroin and over 95 % of what enters Europe , smuggled into the Netherlands via Pakistan .
The counter - narcotics drive has been blighted by policy differences .
The British government , leading the effort , favours poppy eradication on the ground and wants farmers to adopt substitute crops .
But with opium producing $ 12,700 a hectare compared with$220 a hectare for wheat , this is more easily said than done .
The US prefers a more aggressive Colombia - style strategy of spraying poppy fields , which is unpopular with poor farmers .
The drug barons , meanwhile , are getting richer and more powerful .
Helping Afghanistan is a mammoth task - but it is also a case of self - interest : Afghan poppies end up as heroin on British streets , underlining the fateful inter - dependence of our unequal world .
The latest figures were long predicted , but that does not make them any less depressing .
It would be unforgivable if Afghans turned out to have been freed from tyranny to see their failing state strangled by drug - traffickers .
Mr Karzai says that fighting them is a top priority of his administration .
It is hard to disagree with his view that the problem is even more serious than the terrorism that fixates his western backers ."
2004-12-07,"Hamid Karzai was sworn in today as Afghanistan 's first popularly elected president , promising to help the impoverished country leave behind its brutal past , shore up its young democracy and confront the challenges of terrorism and the drugs trade .
Wearing a traditional green robe and a black lambskin hat , a smiling Mr Karzai received a standing ovation on his arrival for the ceremony , which took place in a restored hall of the war - damaged former royal palace .
The US vice - president , Dick Cheney , the highest - ranking US official to visit since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , was among the 600 guests , who included 150 foreign dignitaries .
Following the playing of the Afghan national anthem , Mr Karzai placed his hand on the Qur'an , repeated the oath of allegiance read to him by Afghanistan 's chief justice , Fazl Hadi Shinwari and then the new president swore in his two deputies , Ahmad Zia Massood and Karim Khalili - representatives of the country 's two largest ethnic minorities .
In his inaugural speech , Mr Karzai said the hopes of ordinary Afghans would drive him during what is likely to be a challenging five - year term .
He reiterated his main pledges - to crack down on the booming opium trade , disarm militias and raise living standards .
"" We have now left a dark and difficult past behind us , and today we are opening a new chapter in our history in a spirit of friendship with the international community , "" he said , speaking in Pashtu and Dari , Afghanistan 's two main languages .
But he also warned that fight against terrorism was "" not yet over "" , and called for sustained international aid and cooperation to defeat increasing links between extremists and drug trafficking .
"" The same cooperation has led to the rebuilding of the Afghan state and significant progress in restoring peace , stability and security to our country , "" he said .
Wary of attacks by Taliban or al - Qaida militants , Afghan and international forces launched their biggest security operation since the October 9 election in which Mr Karzai won a landslide victory .
Kabul was calm , but news of a large overnight assault by insurgents on Afghan troops near the Pakistani border was a reminder of the continuing instability outside the capital .
General Khial Baz , a senior Afghan commander , said about 250 militants armed with assault rifles and rockets attacked a military base in Khost province .
Part of the base was destroyed in an hour long battle that left four soldiers and at least six militants dead , he told Associated Press .
"" The Americans did n't come to help us .
They only came this morning to ask questions , "" he said .
Mr Cheney , however , congratulated some of the 18,000 US troops in Afghanistan for helping to give democracy a chance to take root . ""
For the first time the people of this country are looking confident about the future of freedom and peace , "" he said .
"" Freedom still has enemies here in Afghanistan , and you are here to make those enemies miserable . ""
Before the ceremony , Mr Karzai thanked the United States , his main sponsor , for its help . ""
Without that help , Afghanistan would be in the hands of terrorists , "" he said .
"" Terrorism as a force is gone .
As individuals they are all around and we will continue to look for them . ""
The US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , the Iranian foreign minister , Kamal Kharrazi and Pakistan 's interior minister , Aftab Khan Sherpao , were among the guests , while the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan sent his special adviser Lakhdar Brahimi .
Mr Annan also warned in a report to the UN security council that unless Mr Karzai tackles the surge in Afghanistan 's opium production and its arms proliferation , much of the recent progress could be seriously undermined and the economy "" subsumed by the illicit drugs industry "" .
The inauguration was the culmination of a three - year drive to transform Afghanistan from a training ground for al - Qaida extremists into a moderate Islamic republic .
Under Mr Karzai 's interim leadership , Afghans adopted a new constitution labelled by Washington as the most progressive in the region and held their first western - style election , despite attacks by militants that killed at least 15 election workers .
Some three million Afghan refugees displaced by more than two decades of warfare have returned home , and women and girls are back in jobs and schools from which they were barred under the Taliban regime .
The economy has also grown strongly .
But insurgents continue to harass US and Afghan forces across a broad swath of the south and east of the country .
US officials expect to keep their forces at the current level of about 18,000 troops at least until after parliamentary elections scheduled for the spring .
Mr Karzai has said that the drug economy , which now accounts for an estimated one - third of national income , is a bigger threat than the insurgents and will be the top priority for the coming years ."
2004-12-07,"Threatened by the Taliban , surrounded by security forces and watched by the second tier of the Bush administration , Hamid Karzai is due to be inaugurated as Afghanistan 's first democratically elected president this morning .
The ceremony is due to be attended by the US vice - president , Dick Cheney , the defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , and a host of other foreign dignitaries .
Mullah Dadullah , a member of the Taliban leadership council , has warned people to stay away from government buildings during the ceremony .
"" We do not want to harm innocent people , "" he said .
Taliban guerrillas had been told : "" If you get a chance , disrupt the ceremony . ""
Three years after driving the Taliban from power , the US promise of security in Afghanistan has yet to be fulfilled .
Nato peacekeepers and the national security forces threw a security cordon around Kabul last night .
Helicopters skimmed the mountains that ring the city and cars from outside provinces were refused entry .
The international airport is expected to be closed today .
The 150 foreign guests have been asked to provide their blood type .
"" We are very aware that this is yet another opportunity for insurgent activity to take place while the international community 's eyes are again focused on Afghanistan , "" a Nato spokesman , Lieutenant Commander Ken MacKillop , said .
Millions of Afghans are expected to watch the inauguration .
Musicians , dancers and tribal leaders have flocked to Kabul .
The celebrations include a game of the national sport , bushkazi , which involves two teams on horseback competing for a headless calf .
Mr Karzai is expected to announce his cabinet soon ."

2004-12-08,"For 30 years coups , assassinations and invasions were the usual means of power transfer in Kabul .
But yesterday Hamid Karzai broke with bloody tradition and assumed office with a simple formula of words .
Laying a hand on the Qur'an , Afghanistan 's first democratic president swore his allegiance inside the former royal palace that was once the scene of thunderous gunbattles but has since been renovated to welcome 600 guests .
"" We have left a hard and dark past behind us , and today we are opening a new chapter in our history , "" said the blue - blooded Pashtun leader , who has led his country since the US - led invasion in 2001 .
But the perils of power reverberated silently during the short , simple ceremony , which opened with a reading of Islamic verses and songs from a children 's choir .
Beside Mr Karzai sat Zahir Shah , the king who went into exile in 1973 after being deposed by his cousin .
Outside the palace , US , Afghan and European soldiers buckled a tight security perimeter designed to deter Taliban attacks .
Several streets were sealed off , surveillance helicopters droned overhead , and German peacekeepers patrolled on foot .
But yet again the fundamentalists failed to deliver on threats of violence and mayhem , lending credence to suspicions that their insurgency has lost its potency .
That triumph will have pleased the US vice - president , Dick Cheney , who flew in with the defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , to salute the Bush administration 's pet foreign policy success .
Earlier , Mr Cheney rallied American troops in a speech at Bagram airbase , north of Kabul . ""
Freedom still has enemies here in Afghanistan , and you are here to make those enemies miserable , "" he said .
Donald Rumsfeld told troops that in the years ahead they would look back on their service with a sense of pride .
"" You 've been part of something enormously important . ""
He cautioned , however , that the military 's mission would continue .
"" It 's not over , "" he said .
"" There are still groups , extremists , that would like to take this country back ...
It 's not going to happen .
"" The thorniest challenge to Mr Karzai 's administration lay inside the palace .
Fighting the opium trade would be a priority , he stressed , alongside improving security , disarming gunmen and reducing poverty .
But many of the men sitting before him - warlords , outgoing cabinet ministers and governors - are also suspected of involvement in the the record production of opium , the raw material for heroin .
Production rose 64 % this year .
Most Afghans are looking to Mr Karzai 's cabinet line - up , expected soon , for signs that his administration can deliver the promised break from the corrupt , blood - stained past .
Analysts are urging Mr Karzai to spurn the wheeler - dealer mujahideen leaders for educated and qualified ministers .
"" This is President Karzai 's big chance , "" said Brad Adam of Human Rights Watch .
"" He has a popular mandate from the Afghan people .
He should use it to end impunity and warlord rule , now and forever . ""
But the charismatic leader must also balance delicate tribal and regional considerations - a complexity that was echoed across Kabul , where hundreds of tribal leaders gathered to watch the inauguration on a big - screen TV .
Bearded elders wrapped in wool blankets and wearing turbans , skullcaps or sheepskin hats crowded into a chilly hall at the interior ministry .
Security , drugs and managing ethnic tensions were the common concerns .
Noorullah Noorzad , an ethnic Turkmen leader , said Mr Karzai 's rule had brought positive changes , but insecurity was still rampant .
For example , he whispered , some of his tribesmen had been killed by thugs supporting General Abdul Rashid Dostum , the Uzbek warlord who won 11 % of votes in the last election .
Malik Gholam Nabi , an ethnic Pashtun and former mujahid , refused to stand for the national anthem . ""
Karzai is not the right person to solve our problems , "" he said .
"" There are too many foreigners involved with him . ""
But Haji Mir Hussain , a Hazara tribal elder , said the former mujahideen only "" look to their own interest , never to the country ...

"" The biggest credit goes to the Afghan people , who braved long lines and threats of Taliban terror in October to have a say in their political future .
But their hopes wo n't be fulfilled until Afghanistan has an elected parliament as well .
Parliamentary elections , which were originally supposed to be held at the same time as the presidential vote , have repeatedly been postponed .
They have now been set for next April , but keeping to that timetable will require continued American efforts , increased military help from Nato and strong support from the United Nations .

Daily Telegraph Editorial , December 8 "" Drugs and violence often go together .
Afghanistan is no exception , with warlords and their militia funding their operations from opium production .
They are likely to play a bigger , and almost certainly more disruptive , role in the parliamentary elections than they did in the presidential ones ...

Nevertheless , the power of the warlords has diminished as that of the central government has grown .
Ismail Khan was dismissed as governor of the western province of Herat in September .

2004-12-13,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , said yesterday that Osama bin Laden is "" definitely "" in the region and will eventually be caught , even though American and Pakistani generals insist the trail is cold . ""
It 's very difficult to say where he is hiding .
He can not be away from this region .
He 's definitely in this region , "" Mr Karzai told CNN 's Late Edition .
"" We will get him sooner or later , trust me on that . ""
Speculation on Bin Laden 's whereabouts has long focused on the mountains along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan , where the al - Qaida leader slipped away from Afghan and US forces three years ago .
Pakistan 's army has mounted a series of bloody offensives against foreign fighters near the border this year , and American forces launched a winter - long operation last week against Taliban rebels on the Afghan side .
But there has been no indication that they are close to seizing the suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks , which prompted President Bush to launch Operation Enduring Freedom with an assault on Afghanistan .
Pressed in the CNN interview , Mr Karzai declined to say whether Bin Laden could be in Afghanistan or Pakistan .
He said he knew of no suggestion the al - Qaida leader could be in neighbouring Iran . ""
But we can definitely say he 's around this region and he ca n't run for ever , "" Mr Karzai said .
Even though Bin Laden remains at large , and Taliban militants continue to kill Afghan and US soldiers despite an offer of amnesty , Mr Karzai has said he is more alarmed about Afghanistan 's booming narcotics industry , which the United Nations says is turning it into a "" narco - state "" .
Afghan judges and prosecutors yesterday began training for special courts which officials hope will start jailing top heroin and opium traffickers early next year .
US and British counter - narcotics experts are training Afghan security forces who have begun destroying drug stockpiles , smashing refining laboratories and arresting traffickers .
Plans are also being laid to destroy opium poppy crops early next year while offering farmers hundreds of millions of dollars to switch to less lucrative but legal crops ."
2005-02-16,"President Hamid Karzai is preparing to appoint Afghanistan 's first female provincial governor , his spokesman said yesterday , in another step towards reviving women 's rights trampled by the former hardline Taliban government .
An all - female shortlist including the former women 's minister Habiba Sarobi has been drawn up for the governorship of central Bamiyan province , presidential spokesman Jawed Ludin said , though no decision has been taken . ""
One of those ladies will be the governor of Bamiyan , "" Mr Ludin said at a news conference .
"" If a woman is able to do the job , the law says we can appoint her . ""
Ms Sarobi said she had discussed the position with Mr Karzai after rejecting his suggestion that she become an Afghan ambassador abroad .
"" I want to be inside the country at the service of my people , "" she said .
Millions of women and girls have returned to work and school since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001 .
Equality before the law is embedded in a new constitution , and some women have abandoned the head - to - toe public veiling that was mandatory under the tough Islamist regime .
Seats are also reserved for women in the two - chamber parliament to be installed by elections this year .
However , conservative custom still confines most rural women to the home , and health services to alleviate high levels of maternal and infant mortality are being extended only slowly ."
2005-03-02,"One of Afghanistan 's most notorious warlords is to serve as chief of staff to President Hamid Karzai with responsibility for the country 's armed forces .
Despite calls for Mr Karzai to sideline regional strongmen in his administration , the decision to bring General Abdul Rashid Dostum into the national government suggests he still needs their support .
Gen Dostum 's fearsome reputation is built on allegations that he ordered the crushing of prisoners under tanks and suffocated Taliban fighters in sealed shipping containers .
He controls much of northern Afghanistan , from his Mazar - i - Sharif stronghold , and his Uzbek army recently seized a northern city from pro - government forces .
Announcing the appointment yesterday , Mr Karzai 's spokesman , Jawed Ludin , said the allegations of war crimes were not relevant to his new role . ""
Let 's not talk about that because that 's a completely different issue , "" he said .
Despite urgings by rights groups for him to use his electoral mandate to marginalise regional warlords , in naming his cabinet last year Mr Karzai found room for another strongman , Ismail Khan , who resisted attempts to extend central control in the west of Afghanistan last year .
Gen Dostum came fourth in October 's presidential elections .
Diplomats say he felt sidelined after being left out of Mr Karzai 's new cabinet , having served as a military adviser to his previous government .
A former communist , Gen Dostum - a burly , moustachioed figure - has been an adept switcher of sides in the numerous invasions and civil wars that have ravaged Afghanistan since the Soviets moved troops in , in 1979 .
His defection to the mojahedin was one of the main factors in the downfall of the last communist government , in 1992 .
He lost control of the north - eastern city of Mazar - i - Sharif to the Taliban in 1998 but regained it in 2001 when his forces joined the US - led invasion .
Relations between Mr Karzai and Gen Dostum have often been strained .
The warlord was almost killed in January when a suicide bomber blew himself up within metres of him at a religious celebration .
He had been praying in Sheberghan , his stronghold in northern Afghanistan where he still holds Taliban prisoners , when a man detonated explosives strapped to his body after failing to push past his target 's bodyguards .
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt , accusing Gen Dostum of war crimes stretching back to the Taliban 's fall in 2001 ."
2005-03-18,"Afghanistan 's much delayed parliamentary elections have been put off until the autumn , it emerged yesterday as the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , visited President Hamid Karzai .
During her visit five people were killed and at least 32 injured by a bomb in a busy commercial area of Kandahar , 280 miles south - west of Kabul .
It was the worst bombing since August .
The fragile security situation has raised fears for the elections , which were meant to take place last year , and had been put back to May.
Inadvertently , Ms Rice appeared to force Mr Karzai 's hand , referring at a joint press conference to a election "" later this year "" , even though no date had been announced .
When asked for clarification , she said : "" I hope I did n't break the story . ""
Mr Karzai then announced that voting for parliament and the provincial councils would take place in September .
Although the day has not been set , diplomats and electoral officials said that the middle of the month was most likely .
Ms Rice 's six - hour visit was sandwiched between meetings in neighbouring Pakistan .
"" This is not the Pakistan of September 11 .
It is not even the Pakistan of 2002 , "" she told reporters , praising the military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , for his resolve in the war on terror , while urging greater democratic progress .
"" We admire the courage of the Pakistani leadership and the courage of the Pakistani people and the armed forces in the fight against terrorism . ""
Gen Musharraf said earlier this week that Pakistan had come close to catching Osama bin Laden , who is believed to be hiding near the Pakistani - Afghan border .
The US still has about 17,000 personnel hunting al - Qaida and Taliban members in south and east Afghanistan .
Commanders say the threat from the Taliban has waned though officials blamed them for yesterday 's bomb .
A Taliban spokesman denied responsibility .
Ms Rice promised that the US would not abandon Afghanistan , as it had in the past , referring to the period after the 1989 Soviet withdrawal , which allowed the Taliban and , eventually , al - Qaida , to flourish .
"" We learned the hard way what it meant not to have a long - term commitment,""she said .
She would not be drawn on whether the US wanted long - term bases in Afghanistan , which has Iran and central Asian countries with oil resources among its neighbours .
Ms Rice asked to be briefed on drugs , underlining the seriousness with which the US regards the expansion of poppy cultivation .
The state department said recently that Afghanistan was liable to become a "" narco state "" if the trade , which supplies 90 % of world heroin , was not halted .
The September elections are seen as the next challenge for Afghanistan 's fledgling democracy .
They promise to be far more politically charged and potentially volatile than October 's presidential election , which Mr Karzai won easily .
The dangers threatening the election campaign include ethnic rivalries , intimidation and the influence of drug money .
The election has been held up for months by the sensitive issue of population statistics .
Each province 's share of the 249 parliamentary seats will be determined by its population , but no proper census data has been collected for decades .
Another thorny task facing the joint UN - Afghan election body is the vetting of candidates for past human rights abuses .
Officials must ensure that the parliament "" is not stuffed with warlords , drugs dealers and human rights abusers "" , a diplomat said .
The difficulty lies in establishing proof .
Despite numerous massacres and other atrocities
virtually no Afghan has been convicted of war or human rights crimes since the fighting erupted in 1978 .
One of the main war crimes suspects , the Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum , was recently appointed chief of staff to the commander of the armed forces .
Like other senior US visitors , Ms Rice did not spend the night in Kabul but returned to Pakistan before continuing to Japan , Korea and China ."
2005-04-04,"A simmering row between the Afghan government and western aid agencies exploded into the open yesterday with accusations that non - governmental organisations have squandered billions of pounds earmarked for reconstruction .
On the eve of a major donor conference , President Hamid Karzai said he had a responsibility "" to stop NGOs that are corrupt , wasteful and unaccountable "" .
The statement came on the heels of a law mooted last Monday that would effectively shut aid agencies out of some of the largest projects .
According to Mr Karzai , the law reflects "" serious concern "" that some NGOs are responsible for widespread corruption and misuse of public funds .
His criticism comes amid claims that much western aid is wasted on expensive vehicles , inflated salaries and excessive overheads .
"" This is why the Afghan people are discontented , "" he said .
However , large aid agencies say this is a false picture .
The Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief ( Acbar ) , which represents 88 aid agencies , said overheads averaged less than 15 % for its 23 largest members . ""
No NGO is here to make money , "" it said .
Last year western donors pledged $ 8.3bn ( £ 4.4bn ) over three years for Afghanistan .
The US Congress is expected approve another $ 2 - 3bn .
Aid workers say the government is confusing them with highly paid private contractors - many employed by the US government - who have flooded the country since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 .
These earn up to $ 1,000 a day , live in highly protected compounds and travel in luxury four - wheel drive vehicles .
Western agencies initially supported the new law as a measure to separate real aid agencies from bogus ones .
Many of the 2,400 registered NGOs in Afghanistan are profit - making ventures that exploit their status to bid for large government contracts .
But a last - minute amendment to the bill shuts genuine aid agencies out of funding for programmes such as digging wells , building schools and fostering civil society .
Analysts said the amendment may have been driven by wrangling over access to funds between ministers in the recently formed cabinet .
The controversy comes at the start of the Afghan Development Forum , a three - day conference to determine aid priorities for the coming year .
Mr Karzai has set up a committee to examine the new law .
It is due to report back within a month ."
2005-04-13,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , used his meeting today with the visiting US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , to lobby for a long - term security partnership with the US .
However , neither he nor Mr Rumsfeld committed to a permanent US military presence after holding talks to discuss the US military 's future in Afghanistan .
"" The Afghan people want a long - term relationship with the US , "" Mr Karzai told a joint press conference in Kabul .
"" They want this relationship to be a sustained economic and political relationship and , most importantly of all , a strategic security relationship to enable Afghanistan defend itself , to continue to prosper , and to stop the possibility of interferences in Afghanistan . ""
Mr Karzai said he would formally put the request to the US president , George Bush , but did not say when that would happen .
"" We do n't want to talk about permanent bases .
We are talking about a complete relationship to give us full confidence that Afghanistan wo n't be destroyed again , "" he added .
Mr Rumsfeld described the military to military relationship between Afghanistan and the US as good , saying that it had grown stronger .
However , he remained noncommittal about whether Washington hoped to establish permanent military bases there .
"" What we generally do when we work with another country ... we find ways we can be helpful - maybe training , equipment or other types of assistance .
We think more in terms of what we are doing rather than the question of military bases and that type of thing , "" he said .
There are 8,500 Nato troops in Afghanistan , who have been gradually fanning out from the capital in order to provide more security in the north and west while the 17,000-strong US force focuses on fighting insurgents in the south and east .
Mr Rumsfeld - who yesterday visited Iraq - made an unannounced visit to the war - torn country before travelling to Pakistan for talks with the president , Pervez Musharraf , and other leaders .
Earlier , he had met US troops in the south - eastern Afghan cities of Kandahar and Qalat , where US soldiers have been running what is described as a provincial reconstruction team , providing civic aid as well as security for rebuilding projects .
In a detailed briefing about their operations in Zabul province , along the border with Pakistan , US commanders told the defence secretary that Taliban fighters still had some sanctuaries and support among the local population .
However , they said US forces , operating with newly trained Afghan troops , had been making steady progress in eroding that support .
Qalat lies around 90 miles north of the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar , and is 30 miles from the Pakistan border , where the Afghan government has been struggling with a counter - narcotics campaign .
Mr Rumsfeld shook hands and posed for photographs with a group of soldiers in the city , thanking them for their work before flying to Kandahar , where he spoke to several hundred soldiers and answered questions .
One soldier asked when the US army would shorten tours from 12 to six months for those serving in Afghanistan or Iraq .
Mr Rumsfeld replied that the military was considering the idea , but had not yet made a decision .
The defence secretary told soldiers that both Afghans and Americans would look back on this period as a turning point in the spread of freedom .
"" You 're earning your place in history , "" he said .

2005-05-22,"Afghanistan 's President Hamid Karzai was last night on his way to the US , promising to confront George Bush over the growing scandal about American abuse of Afghan prisoners .
Karzai 's visit comes at a time of intense crisis in America 's relations with the Muslim world after the release of pictures of Saddam Hussein in US detention and widespread abuse allegations against US troops from Guantánamo Bay to Kabul .
Karzai , who is a staunch ally of America and owes his presidency to America 's defeat of the Taliban in 2001 , began his trip by speaking out strongly against US soldiers accused of abusing prisoners in Afghanistan .
The allegations , first revealed in a New York Times story on Friday , detail horrific abuses carried out by US soldiers against Afghan suspects .
They include harsh beatings and one incident where a prisoner was hung from the roof of his cell by his wrists .
That prisoner , a 22-year - old taxi driver known as Dilawar , later died .
Karzai said he was shocked at the news of the abuse and the portrayal of brutal and poorly trained US soldiers seemingly acting without restraint .
The newspaper 's article was partly based on a 2,000-page military report on the incidents . '
It has shocked me thoroughly and we condemn it .
We want the US government to take very , very strong action , ' Karzai said .
However , both Afghan and US officials were trying to stay upbeat about the relationship between their two countries .
Both sides insisted the recent scandals would not overshadow talks Karzai is scheduled to have with President Bush later this week .
Karzai is set to reaffirm his government 's closeness to the White House and press for closer security ties .
But at the same time he will ask America for the return of Afghan prisoners and ultimate control over US military operations .
Karzai is facing bitter criticism in Afghanistan for heavy - handed US military tactics . '
No operations inside Afghanistan should take place without the consultation of the Afghan government . '
They should not go to our people 's homes any more without the knowledge of the Afghan government , ' Karzai said .
That is unlikely .
The US sees Afghanistan and the search for Osama bin Laden , who is believed to be in the border areas of Pakistan , as central to its self - proclaimed war on terror .
In fact , America is keen to establish permanent military bases on Afghan soil , which could undermine Karzai 's authority and be hugely unpopular with many Afghans .
However , Bush yesterday heaped praise on Afghanistan 's post - Taliban government and said that America was working closely with Karzai to ensure that the country 's fledgling democracy is a success . '
We 're helping Afghanistan 's elected government solidify these democratic gains and deliver real change .
A nation that once knew only the terror of the Taliban is now seeing a rebirth of freedom , and we will help them succeed , ' Bush said in his weekly radio address .
Bush said he would discuss Afghanistan 's ' remarkable progress ' with Karzai and added that he believed Islamic militants had been dealt a series of ' devastating blows ' in recent encounters with American troops .
Bush did not mention the ongoing scandal of alleged abuse of the Koran by American soldiers in Guantánamo .
Reports of that abuse led to a series of riots in Afghanistan that led to at least 15 deaths and attacks on foreign aid workers ."
2005-05-23,"US officials embarrassed the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , yesterday on the eve of his meeting with George Bush by leaking the contents of a memo that said he was "" unwilling to assert strong leadership "" in the country 's war against heroin production .
A cable from the US embassy in Kabul to the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , seen by the New York Times , also said Britain was "" substantially responsible "" for the failure of a poppy eradication programme because it had sent teams to the wrong areas and refused to change targets .
Mr Karzai , who will also meet Ms Rice while he is in Washington , strongly denied the allegations yesterday , claiming that it was America and Britain who were responsible for the failure of the programme . ""
In parts of the country where the Afghan government took the lead poppies were destroyed considerably , "" he told CNN . ""
So we have done our job .
The Afghan people have done our job .
The failure is theirs , not ours . ""
He pointed out that in the areas where the plan had failed the US and Britain were in control . ""
Now the international community must come and provide alternative livelihood to the Afghan people , which they have not done so far .
Let us stop this blame . ""
Mr Karzai also called for tough punishments for those who allegedly abused detainees at Bagram , the main US base in Afghanistan .
"" We are angry about this and we want justice , we want the people responsible for this behaviour punished , "" he said .
However , Mr Karzai said the behaviour of the interrogators should not reflect on the US government or its people .
"" There are bad people everywhere , "" he said .
The three - page cable sent on May 13 said that provincial officials and village elders had impeded the destruction of poppies and that Afghan officials , including Mr Karzai , had done little to intervene .
It said : "" Although President Karzai has been well aware of the difficulty in trying to implement an effective ground eradication programme , he has been unwilling to assert strong leadership , even in his own province of Kandahar . ""
The New York Times said it was shown the cable - drafted by embassy personnel involved in the anti - drugs efforts - by an official alarmed at the slow pace of poppy eradication and the effect it could have on the American - led reconstruction effort .
A state department spokeswoman refused to comment yesterday .
Despite the claim about Britain 's failings , British officials in Kabul said yesterday they enjoyed an "" excellent "" relationship with their American counterparts .
A senior official said he believed Mr Karzai "" remained committed "" to the anti - drugs fight .
But Britain and American have repeatedly chafed against each other in the Afghan anti - drugs effort .
The problem springs partly from a disparity of influence and money - the UK officially leads the drugs war because most of the country 's heroin ends up in Europe but the US has by far the largest budget .
This year the US announced it was spending $ 780 m ( £ 430 m ) on the campaign - although Congress has approved just $ 260 m so far - while the UK budget is $ 100 m .
The US budget boost came after months of whispered criticism from American officials accusing British colleagues of taking a "" soft "" approach .
Afghanistan 's heroin trade has grown explosively since 2001 ; it now accounts for almost all world supply and 40 % of the Afghan economy .
In answer British officials said they were focusing on "" alternative livelihoods "" - rural support such as wells , roads and irrigation schemes - intended to wean farmers off opium , which pays at least 10 times more than other crops .
The US has advocated faster but more controversial solutions , with mixed results : spraying crops with pesticides has met strong resistance from Afghans , and the funding of training for a paramilitary force to bust the labs and arrest the traffickers has been only modestly successful .
The leaked memo refers to a failed operation in Maiwand , near Kandahar , which saw armed farmers open fire on American - led teams attempting to uproot their opium .
In contrast the most effective drugs busts have been achieved by the Afghan special narcotics force ( ASNF ) , a small and highly secretive military team trained by British special forces .
Since January 2004 it has seized more than 100 tonnes of opium and destroyed 100 heroin labs .
British officials are coy about discussing the SAS role in the ASNF but claim it has succeeded in denting the countrywide drugs trade . ""
As we speak there 's a fresh operation taking place in two districts in Kandahar , "" said the British official yesterday .
Cultivation levels have fallen by over 50 % in Nangarhar , last year 's largest opium growing province , he added ."

2005-05-29,"Hundreds of British soldiers are to be sent to fight the Taliban in their heartland of southern Afghanistan under plans drawn up by military chiefs to bolster the authority of President Hamid Karzai 's fledgling government .
At least 1,000 soldiers will be deployed to help restore order across five of Afghanistan 's most lawless provinces as part of an expansion of Nato operations .
At the same time , Britain 's commanding officer in Afghanistan admitted that it will be ' years ' , possibly ' a generation ' , before Britain will be able to leave the country .
The provinces include Uruzgan , home of Taliban leader Mullah Omar , and Kandahar , the former Taliban stronghold .
The area is where resistance to the West and the government in Kabul remains a threat and where only last weekend a US soldier was killed and three injured in a Taliban attack .
The deployment , which will take place next spring , will mark a significant extension of Britain 's role in Afghanistan and prompt concerns over the level of UK military commitments overseas , especially while the conflict in Iraq continues .
So far British troops have been deployed principally in the capital , Kabul , and in the largely peaceful northern cities of Mazar - e - Sharif and Meymaneh .
The south , by contrast , has remained largely beyond the control of Karzai 's government and has been patrolled only sporadically by US troops seeking Taliban and al - Qaeda remnants .
There have been a number of clashes , leading to American fatalities , as well as attacks on aid workers , who now regard much of the region as a ' no - go ' area .
Although an official announcement of the plan to send British troops to the south has yet to be made , Colonel James Denny , commander of British forces in Afghanistan , told The Observer that a decision would be announced next month .
He said the move would require British troops to engage in ' peace - enforcing rather than peace - keeping ' . '
We are looking at a series of options , ' Denny said at the British headquarters in Kabul . '
We are looking at moving into the southern region - Nimruz , Helmand , Kandahar and Zabul provinces .
The threat from the Taliban and al - Qaeda is higher there than in the north , so we may have to change our rules of engagement - to move to a more aggressive posture . '
Denny said the provinces posed numerous challenges .
There is only one metalled road , communications were difficult and the heat in the summer was more intense than in the north .
The area is populated largely by Pashtun tribes - the Taliban 's principal supporters - whose beliefs , codes of honour and general way of life differ significantly from those of the population in the areas where British troops operate now . '
It 's going to be challenging and an interesting environment , but it is certainly possible to achieve success , ' he added .
' We 've achieved success in the north and there 's no reason why we should n't be successful in the south . '
Denny also warned that there was no swift exit for Britain from Afghanistan , despite last year 's election of Karzai and the growing capabilities of the Afghan forces . '
Afghanistan has a history as being difficult to govern .
There has always been a degree of lawlessness , not just for the past 30 years but for 300 or 400 years .
What we have to do is to build the capability of the Afghan forces to deal with that and allow Nato and coalition forces to withdraw .
It could be a generation , ' he said .
Colonel Huw Lawford , a British officer working for Nato , said the coming mission would be vital : ' You will not be going out in Land Rovers , you will be going out in armed Warrior vehicles , and you will not be walking around in a beret , you will be going out in a tin hat , with a rifle and body armour .

2005-09-20,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , called yesterday for a major shift in the battle against Taliban insurgents , away from American military strikes and towards greater political pressure on neighbouring Pakistan .
"" I do n't think there is a big need for military activity in Afghanistan anymore , "" he told reporters as election officials started counting votes from Sunday 's parliamentary poll . ""
The nature of the war on terrorism has changed . ""
US air strikes on presumed Taliban hideouts , which have killed hundreds of militants this year and probably many civilians , were "" not very effective "" , he said .
"" Rather we should concentrate on where the terrorists are trained , on their bases , on the supply to them , on the money coming to them , "" he said .
Mr Karzai avoided direction mention of Pakistan , but it was the strongest articulation yet of a widely held feeling among Afghan officials that Pakistan is at best ignoring and at worst harbouring Taliban militants .
Pakistan denies the allegations , saying it deployed an extra 9,000 troops to guard the border in recent weeks .
Mr Karzai also demanded an immediate end to a controversial American practices in sensitive southern and eastern areas . ""
No coalition forces should go to Afghan homes without the authorisation of the Afghan government , "" he said .
And he rejected proposal by President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan to build a fence along the 900-mile border as "" neither practical nor advisable "" .
"" It 's separating people , it 's not preventing terrorism , "" he said .
The idea was mooted by General Musharraf at a UN meeting in New York and supported by the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice .
Mr Karzai , who was elected president in a landslide vote last October , said he felt "" relief and satisfaction "" that the weekend poll passed peacefully .
But he rejected suggestions that a lower than expected turnout was a sign of voter disillusionment and sidestepped criticism that only 32 candidates were disqualified for links to armed groups .
"" Sometimes better life is a luxury that people ca n't afford , "" he said .
"" I 'm very happy with what we have . ""
UN election officials have projected a turnout of just over 50 % - down from 70 % in the presidential vote .
Many voters said they were confused by the large choice of candidates , disheartened with the slow pace of reconstruction , and unhappy that some warlords had been allowed to stand .
Counting is expected to take about two weeks .
Corruption and drugs were now Afghanistan 's biggest problems , he said .

He is due to hold talks with the president , Hamid Karzai , and the Afghan defence minister , Rahim Wardak , on Saturday .
A ministry of defence spokesman said Mr Reid would also visit British soldiers stationed in Afghanistan during his trip .
Around 9,000 British soldiers are already stationed in the Persian Gulf , and up to 4,000 are likely to be deployed in Afghanistan next May.
Mr Reid has said UK troops will remain in Afghanistan until conditions are right for them to withdraw .
His arrival in Kabul came two days after a suicide bomber killed nine people and wounded 36 outside an Afghan army training centre in the capital .
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast , and warned that more attacks would follow .
Afghanistan held parliamentary elections 10 days ago - the first for more than three decades ."
2005-10-21,"Hamid Karzai , president of Afghanistan , said yesterday he was "" very unhappy "" to learn that US soldiers had burned the bodies of two dead Taliban fighters .
But he said mistakes happened in war and Afghans should not let the incident mar their impression of the US .
His comments came amid warnings by Islamic clerics of a possible violent anti - American backlash .
Cremating bodies is banned under Islam .
Mr Karzai has ordered an inquiry into the television footage that purportedly shows US soldiers burning the bodies .
The US military has also launched an investigation ."
2005-12-20,"After three decades of coups , chaos and bloodshed Afghanistan 's parliament reopened yesterday amid hopes that it will root the nation 's fledgling democracy .
A collection of MPs - including women , warlords and Taliban defectors - crammed into the renovated national assembly for a simple ceremony .
"" We should stand bravely before the world to say we have emerged from war , "" said President Hamid Karzai , tears welling up in his eyes .
"" This homeland will live forever ! ""
The US vice - president , Dick Cheney , and his wife , Lynne , listened silently in the front row .
Elections in Afghanistan and Iraq would be "" an inspiration to democratic reformers in other lands "" , he later told troops at Bagram airbase .
But optimism was tempered with disappointment that so many strongmen , some accused of war crimes , had been allowed to run for office .
Sharif Zurmati , a TV newsreader turned politician , said the inauguration stirred mixed emotions .
"" I was happy
but then I looked at the people I was sitting with - the same ones who committed crimes , shed much blood , made women into widows and children into orphans .
I am very worried they will start a second war . ""
Abdul Rasul Sayaaf , a once powerful mujahideen commander now running for speaker , denied accusations that his supporters had offered bribes for votes .
"" Our people have not interfered , "" he said .
Mr Sayaaf warily welcomed plans for a truth and justice commission to examine past abuses .
"" All of us want to see justice being implemented but after proper research , not the wishes of a small number of people , "" he said .
King Zahir Shah , 91 , who presided over the last parliament until being overthrown in 1973 , opened the inauguration .
Mr Karzai repeated pleas for an end to the booming drugs trade .
At least 20 parliamentarians are directly involved in drugs smuggling , according to diplomats .
Tellingly , MPs clapped when he said neighbouring countries "" should not interfere in our affairs "" .
Many Afghans blame Pakistan for a sharp resurgence in Taliban violence that has rocked southern provinces in recent months .
A Taliban suicide bomb exploded near the parliament last Friday , intensifying a citywide lockdown from dawn yesterday .
After Mr Cheney entered the parliament chaotic scenes erupted when Afghan security guards insisted on searching the Americans ' bags - including a briefcase containing America 's secret nuclear bomb codes .
An angry White House official ordered the guards to "" open the gate now "" , an AP reporter said .
"" These are the vice - president 's military aides . ""
The Afghans , who were trained by the US security contractor Dyncorps , allowed the aides through but insisted on a thorough body search of the rest of the party .
The new parliament starts work this morning .
One of its first tasks will be to approve Mr Karzai 's cabinet - a prospect likely to prompt a reshuffle ."
2006-01-18,"Afghanistan has always been a dangerous place , and it may be getting more dangerous both for ordinary Afghans and for the foreigners helping steer this long - suffering country towards stability and democracy .
The suicide bombers who have killed 25 people in three days are an alarming novelty for President Hamid Karzai and for the Nato countries in the 9,000-strong International Security Assistance Force .
That is especially so for the Dutch government , facing opposition to a new troop deployment and a transatlantic crisis if parliament in The Hague says no .
Now concerns are starting to be heard in Britain , where Tony Blair has pledged some 3,000 more men , most for Helmand province in the volatile south , where the Taliban and drug traffickers are active .
MPs on the Commons defence committee showed yesterday that there is a lot to be worried about .
The shadow of Iraq hangs over Afghanistan , but there are important differences between the two .
Nato is in Afghanistan under UN mandate and at the request of the Kabul government .
There is consensus across the 26-member alliance - including France , Germany and Belgium , which all opposed the war in Iraq - that there must be no return to the failed state left after the Soviet withdrawal , when the dreadful Taliban regime tolerated the activities of al - Qaida with devastating consequences for Afghanistan and , after 9/11 , the rest of the world .
Separately , these and other countries also take part in the US - led counter - insurgency campaign on the rugged border with Pakistan .
The existence of two distinct but closely related military missions in the same place is one reason why there are misgivings about the expanded Nato deployment .
Another is resentment - reflecting diminishing post - Cold War alliance solidarity - that Canadians , British and Dutch are being asked to replace US troops who are going home because of their larger and unpopular commitment in Iraq .
MPs are rightly worried about chains of command , rules of engagement , confusion between reconstruction and ( riskier ) combat duties , and the lack of guarantees that anyone captured by British forces will not end up being tortured or sent to Guantanamo Bay .
There is uncertainty too about the "" anti - narcotics "" element of the strategy and how that squares with the fact that ( US - tolerated ) and heroin - rich warlords remain so powerful .
Afghanistan deserves our help - more rather than less .
But the British public and armed forces deserve clearer explanations of what they are being asked to do and for how long they are likely to be doing it ."
2006-01-19,"The British government is to co - host an international summit in London at the end of the month to agree a five - year plan to speed up the reconstruction of Afghanistan and confront an upsurge in violence .
The conference is to be chaired jointly by Tony Blair , Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , and Kofi Annan , the United Nations secretary - general .
Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , is also scheduled to attend .
In the face of criticism that Afghanistan has been forgotten by the international community , Mr Annan told the Guardian : "" After all they have achieved in recent years , the Afghan people deserve to be reassured that [ Afghanistan 's ] special relationship with the international community will remain strong . ""
The London conference is an excellent opportunity to send a signal to [ the Afghans ] that the outside world continues to share their goals as they build a democracy that respects the rights of all . ""
The announcement of the conference came as a Taliban commander said hundreds of his guerrillas were ready to launch suicide attacks across Afghanistan to drive out foreign forces .
Violence is at its highest level since the US - led invasion in 2001 .
On Monday a suicide attack killed 23 at Spin Boldak .
The British government is planning to send in more than 3,000 extra troops this spring , a deployment that will pit them directly against the Taliban , drug - traffickers and elements of al - Qaida in the south , the most anarchic and dangerous part of the country .
The conference , dubbed Bonn Two , is a follow - up to a summit in the former German capital in December 2001 at which Afghans and the international community agreed a timetable for establishing democracy .
The opening of the Afghan national assembly in December after elections marked a formal end to the Bonn process , and Mr Annan and Mr Karzai want to embark on a new phase .
After briefing the security council on Tuesday , Jean Arnault , head of the UN 's Afghanistan programme , said recent violence had "" served as a sad reminder of the magnitude of the outstanding tasks in the consolidation of peace in Afghanistan "" .
The Afghan government and its international supporters have almost completed a "" compact for Afghanistan "" to be launched at the conference .
Mr Annan expressed hope that it would provide "" a comprehensive and strong blueprint for what will be , in the next five years , an intensive exercise in peacebuilding . ""
The conference will set out benchmarks and a timetable for security , good government , human rights , rule of law , development and combating drug - trafficking .
It is to be held at Lancaster House , site of many big international conferences , on January 31 and February 1 .
John Bolton , the US ambassador to the UN , said the US , along with others , would be making a "" major pledge in support of Afghan development "" at the conference .
The UN said there had been 19 suicide attacks in the past 12 months , 13 of them in the past 10 weeks .
The US , struggling with troop rotation in Iraq , is hoping to cut its troop strength in Afghanistan from 18,000 to 16,500 in the next few months .
Members of Nato , who have an peacekeeping force of almost 10,000 , are due to increase their numbers to 15,000 and take over responsibilities from US forces in the south .
Although the British have committed troops , promises from countries such as the Netherlands have run into domestic political problems .
The threat of more suicide bombers was delivered by Mullah Dadullah , a Taliban commander , speaking by satellite phone and reported by Reuters news agency .
He said : "" An increase in the number of foreign forces in Afghanistan will make it easier to attack and inflict losses on them . ""
He added : "" Hundreds of Afghan Taliban mujahideen are ready for suicide attacks .
They only await orders from the Taliban leadership .
""
The Afghan government said the insurgents appear to be trying to frighten Nato members dithering over whether to join the expanded force .
The Afghan suicide bombers seem to have been inspired by the success of Iraqi suicide bombers .
The fighting has been fiercest along the border with Pakistan , where US forces have been battling remnants of the Taliban and continuing their hunt for al - Qaida , whose leaders they believe are hiding in tribal areas along Pakistan 's border .
The US launched an airstrike on Friday aimed at the al - Qaida number two , Ayman al - Zawahri , an Egyptian , but killed 18 villagers .
Pakistani intelligence sources yesterday said three of four al - Qaida members believed to have been killed included Zawahri 's son - in - law , Abdul Rehman Al - Misri al - Maghribi .
Another was Midhat Murfi al - Sayid Omer , an explosives expert who carried a $ 5 m US reward on his head .
The third man named was Abu Obaidah al Misri , al - Qaida 's chief of operations in Afghanistan 's eastern Kunar province .
Backstory US - led air strikes on Afghanistan began in October 2001 in the wake of September 11 and a month later Kabul fell .
Afghan exiles and representatives from inside the country met UN officials and international diplomats in Bonn in December that year to agree a political process for the country .
This blueprint , which became known as the Bonn process , set out a timetable for a meeting of the Loya Jirga , a traditional Afghanistan decision - making body , to be followed by elections and the establishment of a national assembly .
The Loya Jirga met in June 2002 and elected Hamid Karzai as interim president .
Elections were held in the autumn of 2004 for a president , which Mr Karzai won , and elections to a national assembly in September last year .
The London conference , dubbed Bonn Two , is to set out a blueprint for the next five years ."
2006-01-31,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , said today that his country has made "" great strides towards peace , stability and democracy "" at the opening of a special donors conference in London .
"" We owe our success to the resilience and unfailing determination of the Afghan people as well as the generous support of the international community .
Together , we have achieved much , "" Mr Karzai told representatives from nearly 70 nations and international bodies . ""
Today , Afghanistan has a constitution , an elected president and an elected parliament .
We are proud that women make up more than a quarter of the seats , "" he said , though he also cautioned that major challenges still lay ahead . ""
The challenges of terrorism and narcotics present the gravest of threats ... terrorism no longer rules Afghanistan but it continues to be a threat to the peace and security of our people . ""
Tony Blair repeated his commitment to the people of Afghanistan , saying that the international community was determined to ensure the country had a "" stable and prosperous future "" .
Sitting next to Mr Karzai , and the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , Mr Blair said Britain would give £ 500 m over three years to help Afghanistan in the "" tremendous challenge that it faces "" . ""
But we must also remember that tremendous progress has been made not only in terms of its economy and that living standards have risen , but also the progress in terms of liberty and freedom , "" he said .
The prime minister also echoed Mr Karzai 's concerns for the future , admitting the country continued to face major problems including the opium trade and those "" who want to see Afghanistan return to extremism and fanaticism "" .
During recent months , suicide bombings have become prevalent in the divided country , which provides 87 % of the world 's heroin .
Mr Karzai said would work to reduce corruption and red tape and to foster a business community .
He said a modern state depended on having a skilled and modern work force and appealed for international help to achieve that aim .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said the US was pledging $ 1.1bn over the next year . ""
The transformation of Afghanistan is remarkable , but incomplete , "" Ms Rice said in opening remarks . ""
And it is essential that we all increase our support for the Afghan people . ""
The two - day conference will see the launch of the "" Afghan compact "" , a framework for international engagement with Afghanistan over the next five years .
The Afghan government will also present its strategy on development , security , the drugs trade and good governance .
The conference comes as Nato prepares to expand its role in Afghanistan with the deployment of an extra 6,000 troops , many of them from Britain .
The new contingent will move into the volatile south of the country where US troops have been operating , allowing Washington to reduce troop numbers in Afghanistan .
Aid experts warn that the country is "" still a failed state in many respects "" .
President Karzai 's election , a new constitution and the registration of 12.5 million people to vote have given "" some cause for hope "" , according to Christian Aid .
However , "" the rule of law is a pipe dream .
Afghans daily face violence and death at the hands of bandits and warlords "" , said spokesman Dominic Nutt .
"" More Afghans and aid workers were murdered last year than ever before .
It is vital , therefore , that peacekeepers are sent in adequate numbers and the police and judiciary are supported so that they can end the reign if impunity .
Afghans want to see universal justice . """
2006-02-16,"The flies on the wall must have been intrigued by the meeting between the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , and his Pakistani counterpart , General Pervez Musharraf , in Islamabad yesterday .
In public , both pay easy lip service to their "" brotherly "" relations with each another .
But in private , bitter tensions are bubbling over and one issue stands out - their mutual border .
Asked after the meeting whether he was sure of Pakistan 's cooperation in battling the Taliban , Mr Karzai cautiously replied that "" there are areas where we are seeking more cooperation "" .
That is a considerable understatement - he blames Pakistan for the bloody surge in Taliban attacks that has rocked southern Afghanistan .
A rash of suicide bombings - until recently a rarity - has killed around 70 people including foreign peacekeepers , local police , a Canadian diplomat and dozens of innocent civilians over the past three months .
Angry Afghan officials , from cabinet level to village police chiefs , say the militants are streaming across the Pakistani border , a 1,500-mile stretch of desert , mountain and sand .
At best , they say , Islamabad is turning a blind eye to the infiltration .
At worst , it is directly supporting it . ""
The terrorists who come here for suicide attacks are attending training bases in Pakistan and are getting all their equipment there , "" the Afghan interior ministry spokesman , Yousuf Stanezai , said .
As an example , officials pointed to a pair of would - be Pakistani suicide bombers arrested in Kandahar a few weeks ago .
Perhaps uncoincidentally , a transcript of their interrogation was leaked to the New York Times on the eve of Mr Karzai 's visit .
Gen Musharraf 's western allies are also becoming impatient over his failure to master the border area .
Last month , US hellfire missiles destroyed a house in the Bajaur district in which the al - Qaida number two , Ayman al - Zawahiri , was thought to be hiding .
The bombs missed Zawahiri , instead killing 13 villagers .
The Pakistani president and his officers angrily deny any complicity with the Taliban , which they effectively created in the early 90s but publicly shunned after 2001 .
To demonstrate their innocence , they have pointed to the deployment of 70,000 Pakistani troops along the Afghan border .
Last summer , I travelled to the controversial border with the Pakistani army .
In Angoor Adda , a remote outpost amid scrabbly desert and craggy peaks , the commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel GM Awan , scanned the border before passing me his binoculars .
"" Look , "" he said , indicating a line of Pakistani sentry posts .
"" We are guarding every hill and gully . ""
Then he pointed accusingly towards a lone hut on the far side of the border .
"" That is the only American and Afghan position around here , "" he said .
"" So if anybody can slip across , it is their fault and not ours . ""
The truth , however , is almost certainly much murkier .
The Pakistani forces are concentrated in just two tribal agencies - North and Waziristan - which are hotbeds of militant activity but cover only a small patch of the border .
By contrast , hundreds of Taliban are believed to be sheltering in Baluchistan , the sprawling province to the west .
Here , the border is effectively a swinging door for the militants .
The proof is not difficult to find - black - turbaned militants can be seen roaming freely in Quetta , the main city .
For Pakistan 's western allies , the great unknown is whether the Taliban are simply tolerated by the authorities in Quetta , or whether they enjoy covert support , possibly as part of a policy to retain good relations with an old ally .
One popular theory is that sympathetic elements of the ISI spy agency - either serving or retired - are helping to shelter them , but most diplomats admit they simply do n't know .
"" We have asked them to clean up Quetta , "" one senior western official , who has aired the Taliban issue directly with Gen Musharraf , said .
"" They tell us to provide names and addresses . ""
Gen Musharraf 's officers say it is impossible to tell one Pashtun - the Taliban 's tribe - from another , because they flit across the border along centuries - old trails .
A black turban , they add , is not necessarily a sign of militancy .
The issue is likely to become increasingly important to Britain as 3,300 UK troops are deployed to Helmand , a volatile Afghan province touching Baluchistan , over the coming months .
One British diplomat speculated that if the Taliban killed any British soldiers - a likely prospect , given the current levels of violence - then the quiet prodding of Gen Musharraf might become more forceful .
"" We will certainly want to see some changes , "" he said ."
2006-03-01,"George Bush today made his first visit to Afghanistan and said he was confident that Osama Bin Laden would be brought to justice .
The US president arrived this morning for a five - hour stop in Kabul ahead of his three - day visit to India , where thousands of protesters rallied before his arrival , shouting "" Death to Bush "" .
At a news conference with Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , an Afghan reporter pointed out to Mr Bush that it was more than five years since the September 11 2001 attacks and Bin Laden was still at large .
Mr Bush replied : "" I 'm confident he will be brought to justice .
What 's happening is we 've got US forces on the hunt not only for Bin Laden but everybody who plots and plans with [ him ] . ""
He added that "" steady progress "" had been made in "" dismantling al - Qaida "" .
Mr Bush praised the progress that Afghanistan had made in developing democracy and said this inspired others .
He said the American people wanted Afghanistan to "" flourish "" and were touched by "" stories of hope "" about young girls in the country going to school for the first time .
News that Afghanistan had growing numbers of entrepreneurs was also welcome , the president added .
Mr Bush , who will also make a short trip to Pakistan , said that he would raise concerns with Pakistani leaders about terrorists going back and forth across the Afghan - Pakistani border .
Speaking about security in the region , he also gave a clear warning to Tehran that the US would not allow it to have nuclear weapons .
"" You shall not have the means , the knowledge to develop a nuclear bomb , "" Mr Bush warned Iran , which said in recent days that it had advanced its uranium enrichment research .
The US president , his wife Laura and Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , arrived in Afghanistan at about 12.30pm ( 0800 GMT ) at the American military base at Bagram airport , north of Kabul .
Mr Bush 's visit to Afghanistan was not officially announced until Air Force One touched down , but the news leaked out shortly before .
The White House had wanted to conceal Mr Bush 's presence to reduce the risk of any attempt on his life and security was tight in Kabul .
Bin Laden
After a lunch with Mr Karzai and other Afghan leaders , Mr Bush told the news conference that the US supported the country 's fledgling government in the face of increasing violence from al - Qaida and Taliban militants .
The president ordered US forces to lead an invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks to topple the Taliban regime , which was sheltering Bin Laden .
The al - Qaida chief is thought to be hiding somewhere in the mountains on the Afghan - Pakistan border .
Some 3,500 British combat troops are taking over peacekeeping duties from US soldiers in the south of the country to allow more US forces to concentrate on finding members of al - Qaida and the Taliban .
At today 's news conference , Mr Karzai said Afghanistan owed Mr Bush and the American people "" a great , great deal "" and that the country was rebuilding peace and democracy and had great hope for the future .
Mr Bush will visit the new US embassy , which he said was a symbol of America 's commitment to the country , and will meet and thank US troops who are serving there .
Later today Mr Bush will fly on to India , where he will attempt to consolidate the improving relations between the US and the world 's largest democracy .
Ahead of his arrival , thousands of Indians demonstrated against the president 's visit at a rally in New Delhi .
Police said up to 100,000 people , most of them Muslim , gathered in a fairground that is often used for political rallies .
Communist groups - key allies of the Indian prime minister , Manmohan Singh - have planned a large protest march to India 's parliament in New Delhi tomorrow .
The parliament is a few miles from where Mr Bush will hold talks with Mr Singh and meet with other leaders .
Pushpender Grewal , secretary of the Communist party of India , said : "" We will protest against the US policies , especially the inhuman atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq , a likely invasion of Iran and its continuing support to Israel 's illegal occupation of Palestine . ""
Diplomats
In other developments , the Associated Press revealed that the US will send an extra 15 diplomats to China , 15 to Latin America and 12 to India after a major rethink of its foreign policy .
The plans are a reflection that the economic , political and religious frontlines have moved elsewhere and US embassies in Europe will lose 38 diplomats , including one in Britain .
The shift of Washington 's diplomatic weight comes after a Pentagon report last month that envisaged a "" long war "" against terrorism , in which a major propaganda effort would be needed to win hearts and minds in the Muslim world ."
2006-03-02,"Standing behind George Bush inside his Kabul palace yesterday , Hamid Karzai radiated the trappings of a powerful president : a confident smile , massed security guards and the legitimacy bestowed by the 2004 election in which he won 55 % of the vote .
He appeared proud as Mr Bush praised Afghanistan for its progress over the past five years .
But outside the palace walls , Mr Karzai 's hold on power vacillates sharply .
Kabul is a showcase for post - Taliban achievements - growing school attendance , women freely walking the streets and a billion - pound aid industry .
But for all its progress , the capital feels like an overcrowded garrison town .
Electricity is sporadic , crime is soaring and running water is scarce .
Taxis from other cities are turned away at the city limits for fear they might carry militants or suicide bombers .
At night the streets are largely deserted , save for twitchy policemen .
Beyond Kabul , Mr Karzai 's control ranges from minimal to non - existent .
"" You have a government but you do not have a state , with institutions and infrastructure , "" Ayesha Khan , an associate fellow at the foreign affairs thinktank Chatham House , based in London , said yesterday .
Afghanistan is important for Mr Bush and Tony Blair .
It is difficult for them to claim the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a success , given the daily horrors .
But Afghanistan is not so out of control .
There has been visible progress since the 2001 US - led occupation .
The biggest success has been the presidential election , in which voter turnout was 70 % , of which 42 % were women , and the parliamentary and provincial elections in October and November last year , which attracted a turnout of 53 % , of which 43 % were women .
Fears that the remnants of the Taliban and other fighters would disrupt the polling proved groundless .
Other successes include the return of millions of children to school , the rebuilding of 72 hospitals , clinics and women 's healthcare centres and health programmes and campaigns which have led to the near - eradication of polio .
About 3.5 million refugees , emboldened by news of relative peace , have returned home .
A Kabul to Kandahar highway is a testament to western aid , a smooth corridor of tarmac replacing a bone - jarring track .
But as the road heads south , Mr Karzai 's grip on power shifts from a sweaty handhold to virtual lawlessness .
North of Kabul security appears better , maintained by the US - trained Afghan National Army , which has more than 30,000 soldiers , backed up by Nato peacekeepers .
The British patrol Mazar - i - Sharif , the Germans are in Kunduz , where a bicycle bomb killed a German soldier and two Afghan civilians last week , and the Italians in Herat , where business with nearby Iran is prospering .
But the relative stability of the north is illusory .
Mr Karzai has yet to confront the warlords who control most of Afghanistan and have a track record of double - dealing .
His inner circle promised that if he won the election he would rid the government of these warlords .
But they remain in place .
The Uzbek leader , Abdul Rashid Dostum , has the ministry of defence , while the "" Lion of Herat "" , Ismail Khan , was handed the ministry of energy .
Mr Karzai has brought them into the political centre , but there has been no reciprocity : Kabul 's power does not extend to their fiefdoms .
The violence - ridden southern and eastern provinces are largely devoid of international aid and funded by drug money .
The ubiquitous poppy fields feed the heroin habits of Europe and Russia .
UN surveys - a new one is to be published today - show huge increases in production since the fall of the Taliban .
The last year has seen a surge in attacks that have killed almost 100 Americans .
Aid workers barely venture beyond the cities of Kandahar and Jalalabad .
Schools have been attacked and teachers killed .
Testifying in Washington on Tuesday , the director of the Defence Intelligence Agency , Lieutenant General Michael Maples , told Congress : "" We judge insurgents now represent a greater threat to the expansion of Afghan government authority than at any point since late 2001 , and will be active this spring . ""
The insurgency is part - Taliban and Pashtun resistance against Kabul and part inspired by al - Qaida , whose leadership , including Osama bin Laden , is thought to be hiding on the border with Pakistan .
One piece of good news for Mr Bush is that the US military presence will drop this spring from 19,000 to 16,000 , to be replaced in the south by Nato forces , mainly British .
General James Jones , Nato 's supreme commander , said on Tuesday he expected these troops to be attacked as their mission expands .
"" It 's logical to say that we will be tested .
I think we will pass that test , "" he said .
Unlike the US military in Iraq , he was optimistic about Afghanistan .
"" I do not believe there is the capacity for an insurgency of a cohesive nature in this country .
The will of the Afghan people is to do exactly what we are helping them do , "" he said .
The point was reinforced by Hikmet Cetin , the Turkish diplomat who is Nato 's senior civilian representative in Kabul , who noted the sudden appearance of suicide bombing as a tactic in Afghanistan in January . ""
Suicide bombing is not part of the culture of this country .
They are trying to train people to do it , but I do n't think it will be like Iraq , "" Mr Cetin said ."
2006-03-07,"Pakistan imposed a curfew on the battle - scarred tribal town of Miran Shah yesterday in an attempt to end three days of fighting between pro - Taliban militants and government troops .
Thousands of civilians continued to flee the tribal area as helicopter gunships attacked suspected rebel hideouts and militants attacked army checkposts in neighbouring towns .
Meanwhile tension in the border areas was heightened after Pakistan 's president , Pervez Musharraf , accused the Afghan leader , Hamid Karzai , of being "" totally oblivious "" to events in his own country .
General Musharraf 's outburst came on CNN on Sunday night in response to claims that Pakistan was harbouring the one - eyed Taliban leader , Mullah Muhammad Omar .
"" The location that they are talking of Mullah Omar is nonsense .
There 's nobody there , "" Gen Musharraf said .
"" President Karzai is totally oblivious of what is happening in his own country . ""
Gen Musharraf is struggling to impose his authority on the tribal areas , where conservative tribesmen have allied with fugitive al - Qaida militants and Taliban fighters .
A militant video from the area , seen yesterday by the Guardian , gives stark evidence of their growing influence .
The professionally edited DVD shows three men , one of them decapitated , hanging from an electricity pylon in central Miran Shah last December .
A commentary describes them as "" bandits "" guilty of theft , drinking alcohol and "" dishonouring women "" .
Another image shows militants triumphantly holding the decapitated head aloft .
The mutilated remains of another dead man are seen slumped on the ground , a whisky bottle in his lap and a toy dog balanced on his head .
An unmasked turbaned militant grins at the camera .
At the end of the 30-minute programme the militants drag the corpses behind a truck while shouting "" Allahu Akbar ! ""
( God is Greatest ) .
A message flashes up on screen exhorting others to join their movement . ""
Come wage jihad or else you will miss the caravan , "" it says .
The DVD was bought at a market in the tribal areas and is dated December 20 .
A Pakistani army spokesman , Major General Shaukat Sultan , described the killings featured in the video as a matter between rival criminal groups .
But for others it was a reminder of similar killings at the start of Taliban rule in the mid-1990s .
The same militants were probably involved in the battle for Miran Shah , the worst violence for years in north Waziristan tribal agency .
The army said it had regained control of the town telephone exchange and was restoring order .
An all - day curfew was lifted for three hours to allow residents to seek fresh food .
Mr Musharraf yesterday defended the army 's operations in the area , saying that hundreds of foreign militants were hiding in north and south Waziristan . ""
They include Uzbeks , Chechens , Middle Easterners and even some Chinese , "" he said ."
2006-03-24,"International pressure grew today on Afghanistan to free a man on trial for converting from Islam to Christianity , as clerics in Kabul condemned him as an apostate who deserved to die .
Australia 's prime minister , John Howard , today joined the chorus of western leaders expressing concern over the case of Abdul Rahman and said he would protest personally to the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai . ""
This is appalling .
When I saw the report about this I felt sick , literally , "" Mr Howard told an Australian radio network . ""
The idea that a person could be punished because of their religious belief and the idea they might be executed is just beyond belief . ""
Mr Rahman , a 41-year - old former medical aid worker , faces the death penalty under Afghanistan 's Islamic laws for becoming a Christian .
Senior clerics in the Afghan capital have voiced strong support for the prosecution and have warned they would incite people to execute Mr Rahman unless he reverted to Islam .
Mr Rahman had "" committed the greatest sin "" by converting to Christianity and deserved to be killed , cleric Abdul Raoulf said during Friday prayers at his sermon at Herati Mosque .
"" God 's way is the right way , and this man whose name is Abdul Rahman is an apostate , "" he told about 150 worshippers .
Mr Rahman 's trial , which started last week , has fired passions in this conservative Muslim nation and highlighted a conflict of values between Afghanistan and its western backers .
The US president , George Bush , expressed alarm about the case earlier this week , and yesterday the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , telephoned Mr Karzai , seeking a "" favourable resolution "" of the case .
She said Washington looked forward to that resolution "" in the very near future "" .
The presiding judge in the case and a spokesman for Mr Karzai - who took power after the hardline Taliban regime was toppled in a US - led war in late 2001 - declined to comment about the case today , the weekend in Afghanistan .
Ms Rice 's spokesman Sean McCormack said she told Mr Karzai that it was important for the Afghan people to know that freedom of religion is observed in the US .
Her direct appeal to a foreign leader in a judicial proceeding in another country is unusual .
But in deference to the country 's sovereignty , Ms Rice apparently did not demand specifically that the trial be halted and the defendant released .
"" This is clearly an Afghan decision , "" Mr McCormack said .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , told reporters she had received assurances from Mr Karzai in a telephone call that Mr Rahman would not be sentenced to death .
US diplomats , speaking anonymously , claimed that the Afghan government was searching for a way to drop the case .
On Wednesday , Afghan authorities said Mr Rahman is suspected of being mentally ill and would undergo psychological examinations to see whether he is fit to stand trial .
Austria , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , said it was unacceptable for a person to be taken to court and risk the death penalty over a basic right like religious freedom .
"" We will leave no stone unturned to protect the fundamental rights of Abdul Rahman and to save his life , "" Austria 's foreign minister , Ursula Plassnik , said ."
2006-03-26,"Pope seeks mercy for apostate Pope Benedict has appealed to Afghan President Hamid Karzai to drop charges against a man facing a possible death sentence after converting from Islam to Christianity , the Vatican said in a statement .
President George Bush and other Western leaders have also expressed concern about the fate of Abdur Rahman .
Bangkok protest flops Campaigners trying to oust Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra launched a last push to topple him with a rally demanding the king intervene .
But the Bangkok protest , which organisers hoped would draw a million , was attended by only 30,000 , police said , far fewer than in previous weeks .
Clemency plea for apostate Afghan President Hamid Karzai is trying to find a way to free a man from a death sentence for converting from Islam to Christianity .
Officials have said Abdul Rahman , 41 , will be freed soon but Muslim clerics have questioned Karzai 's authority to order his release and have warned of a revolt if he tries . '
The words of our prophet are very clear .
There can only be one outcome : death , ' said cleric Khoja Ahmad Sediqi , who is a member of the Supreme Court .
Pope Benedict has written to Karzai asking for clemency .
Iraqis snubbed by embassy The US embassy in Iraq , fortressed in Baghdad 's Green Zone , is hiring staff from Jordan , rather than Iraq .
The embassy said it was to protect Iraqis , who face ' security and safety risks ' if US - employed , but refused to say if Americans were having difficulty hiring Iraqi staff , or if there were security concerns over using Iraqis who may be insurgency sympathisers ."
2006-05-23,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has ordered an investigation into a US - led air strike on a southern village that killed at least 16 civilians early on Monday .
In a statement , Mr Karzai expressed "" concern at the coalition forces ' decision to bomb civilian areas "" during the attack on Azizi , where Taliban insurgents were sheltering inside a religious school .
But he also condemned Taliban "" cowardice "" in using civilians as human shields during the battle , which was one of the deadliest shows of US firepower since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 .
The US confirmed 20 Taliban deaths in Azizi and estimated 60 more died in air strikes .
But death tolls are notoriously unreliable in Afghanistan - local officials are known to exaggerate enemy deaths and underplay civilian casualties .
Mr Karzai , who is currently visiting the United Arab Emirates , said he would summon the US commander for a full explanation of the civilian casualties on his return to Kabul .
His forceful comments reflect disquiet at heavy - handed coalition tactics against a wave of Taliban attacks .
Afghan officials fear reports of mass civilian casualties will loosen Kabul 's already tenuous grip on the volatile southern provinces , where a 7,000-strong Nato mission dominated by Britain , Canada and the Netherlands will be based .
British officers believe that winning over "" swing voters "" - tribesmen wavering between supporting the insurgents and the government - is vital to success .
Meanwhile fresh violence erupted in the southern Helmand province , where 3,300 British soldiers are being deployed .
A Taliban ambush on a convoy left three police officers dead .
The police claimed they killed 11 Taliban in the firefight ."
2006-05-30,"An early morning traffic accident in Kabul involving a US military vehicle rapidly degenerated yesterday into the worst upheaval in the Afghan capital since the fall of the Taliban , as angry protesters burned vehicles and buildings , ransacked shops and aid agencies and hurled rocks and invective at American soldiers .
By the time the authorities imposed a rare night - time curfew in the normally peaceable capital , eight people had been killed and more than 100 injured .
The upheaval was a shock to a city long considered an oasis of security , and a serious blow to the authority of the president , Hamid Karzai , who is struggling to contain an escalating insurgency in the south .
It was also an alarming day for an American military , already battling large - scale violence in Iraq and squaring up to an emboldened and nuclear - minded Iran .
Now the future of Afghanistan , often trumpeted as a triumph for US foreign policy , is coming under increasing scrutiny .
Yesterday the US - led coalition said it killed up to 50 Taliban fighters in a bombing raid on a village in Helmand province , where 3,300 British troops are deploying .
The air strikes took the death toll from the past two weeks to more than 350 , according to the highest estimates .
The trouble in Kabul was triggered by an accident involving a US military convoy that careered through a busy Kabul intersection yesterday morning , crashing into a dozen vehicles and killing one person , according to a military statement .
But accounts differed about whether American troops fired into a large crowd that gathered .
A spokeswoman , Lieutenant Tamara Lawrence , said US soldiers only fired shots in the air .
But a senior Kabul police office , Sher Shah Usafi , said they fired into the crowd , killing one person .
British Royal Marines , stationed in Afghanistan , rescued EU diplomats after the riots broke out .
They escorted 21 people including a baby and a four - year - old child to the headquarters of the Nato - led Isaf peacekeeping force as mobs swept through the city .
The marines acted after members of the European Commission to Afghanistan requested evacuation from their compound in central Kabul .
Afghan police and soldiers rapidly deployed as rioters smashed police posts , flung rocks at US Humvee troop carriers and marched on the presidential palace , some chanting "" death to America ! ""
Vehicles were set ablaze , businesses ransacked and aid agencies looted .
Residents cowered inside their homes until a measure of calm returned in the late afternoon .
In a televised address last night Mr Karzai appealed to Afghans ' painful memories of the country 's destructive civil war in the 1990s in a call for people to "" stand up "" to the rioters . ""
These people are the enemies of Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" You should stand up against these agitators and not let them destroy our country again . ""
Yet the rioting reflected the simmering anger that many Afghans harbour at everything from the slow pace of reconstruction to the conspicuous wealth of foreigners in Kabul and the aggressive driving tactics of US soldiers and private security contractors in the capital .
The US says the tactics are necessary for security , but one protester , Gulam Ghaus , told the Associated Press : "" Americans killed innocent people .
We will not stop until foreigners leave this city .
We are looking for foreigners to kill . ""
The disturbances spread quickly to central districts frequented by foreigners and close to American and Nato military bases .
Protesters tore down a billboard poster of Mr Karzai , burned a US flag and torched the offices of the aid agency Care International .
"" I 'm pretty shaken , "" said Care 's director , Paul Barker , speaking to the Guardian by telephone from inside the US embassy .
"" About half our office has been burned and everything inside destroyed . ""
He said anger at the road accident may have sparked the initial trouble , but "" simmering anger against foreign influence "" caused the wider violence .
"" There 's a lot of resentment against the perceived wealth of foreigners , "" he said .
Despite $ 12bn ( £ 6.5bn ) in western aid since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , many Afghans are disillusioned with the government for failing to reduce poverty and restore security .
The Nato - led peacekeeping force is responsible for security in Kabul , but a spokesman said Afghan troops insisted on taking the lead in quelling yesterday 's violence .
""
The police did n't want further Isaf or coalition troops inflaming the situation , "" said Major Toby Jackman .
An Afghan parliamentarian , Shukria Barakzai , said some rioters appeared to be well organised .
"" Some had guns and handbombs , "" she said .
"" These people are taking advantage of the situation for political ends , to destroy our country again . ""
Anger at civilian casualties from US bomb strikes may also have fuelled the rioting .
Last week the US military admitted that it killed 16 villagers during an air strike on a Taliban hideout in Kandahar province .
Local human rights activists estimated the death toll as high as 34 .
When American troops arrived in 2001 , they aroused hopes among Afghans for an end to gnawing poverty and incessant violence .
Today , many say they are bitterly disappointed After four years and $ 12bn ,
£ 6.5bn , in foreign aid , the majority of Afghans still scrape through life without electricity or clean water .
More than seven million people are chronically hungry , according to the UN , and 53 % live on less than a dollar , or 54p , a day .
The sight of foreigners earning large salaries and driving large vehicles protected by private security companies has focused frustrations .
More recently , a spate of civilian deaths in US anti - Taliban bombing has aroused public anger in a country with a history of violently ejecting foreign occupiers .
The government and its western backers argue that , since reconstruction started from an impossibly low base , much progress has been made .
The west and north are peaceful , smooth roads stretch through the countryside , and the economy is projected to grow by 10 % this year .
A record number of children attend school .
But faith in the Karzai government , dogged by violence in the south and allegations of corruption in Kabul , is faltering .
Many Afghans believe their $ 12bn in aid has been squandered or stolen ."
2006-06-12,"Western diplomats and disarmament experts reacted with alarm yesterday to Afghan government plans to arm hundreds of southern villagers against resurgent Taliban fighters .
"" There is considerable disquiet , "" said Peter Babbington , director of a national disarmament programme , about the initiative announced by President Hamid Karzai on Sunday .
"" There are serious implications in creating militias . ""
Diplomats worry that the strategy could further destabilise the violent south , at best stalling the disarmament of the estimated 120,000 unofficial gunmen and at worst creating a lawless militia .
Mr Karzai counters that the village force is needed to bolster the beleaguered Afghan police force , which has lost hundreds of officers during heavy fighting this year .
Yesterday , the security forces raided a southern Afghan village and killed 15 suspected militants , including a relative of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar , while fighting elsewhere left 25 dead .
The past three weeks have seen the fiercest battles since the Taliban 's fall in 2001 .
Mr Karzai 's spokesman , Karim Rahimi , termed the new force "" community policemen "" .
But one analyst said : "" You can call it what you wish , but this looks like a rearming of selected warlords . ""
Sher Muhammad Akhunzada , who was sacked as Helmand governor in December for his links to drugs smuggling , claims to have already enlisted 500 men for the force at a monthly salary of $ 200 ( £ 110 ) .
Another former governor , Jan Muhammad of Uruzgan , made a similar offer .
They claim they are doing their duty to repel Taliban and al - Qaida fighters .
Others fear they are using the initiative to re - establish their power bases .
"" How does a governor control an ex - governor who controls a militia ? "" said Mr Babbington .
The government initiative comes amid a sharp rise in violence in the four southern provinces , where 7,000 British , Canadian and Dutch troops are deploying .
On Sunday the British military suffered its first combat fatality when one soldier was killed and two were seriously injured during a battle in Helmand province ."
2006-06-18,"The Thai prime minister has offered to take the remains of the Buddhas of Bamiyan , which were destroyed by Afghanistan 's former Taliban regime , and rebuild them in Thailand .
Thaksin Shinawatra made the proposal to reconstruct the two 1,600-year - old statues to the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
Mr Karzai said that it was a "" good idea "" and that he would discuss it with his government , Mr Thaksin said after returning from a summit in Kazakhstan .
The Taliban used dynamite and artillery to blast the fifth - century statues in 2001 , disregarding worldwide protests ."
2006-06-28,"The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , today insisted that the United States would not pull out of Afghanistan despite a resurgence of violence by Taliban fighters in recent weeks .
On a visit to Kabul , Ms Rice acknowledged that the rise in violence in Afghanistan was a concern for the United States and the US - backed government of Hamid Karzai , but said democratic gains in the country would not be erased . ""
That Afghanistan has enemies is not a surprise to anyone , "" Ms Rice said after meetings behind heavy fortifications with President Karzai and military commanders .
"" We are not going to tire , we are not going to leave , "" she declared .
Mr Karzai said optimism about his country 's gains did not mean he was blind to its problems .
"" When we speak of success , it does n't mean that we forget the problems . ""
Neither Mr Karzai nor Ms Rice directly addressed remarks he made last week in which he said he deplored the deaths of hundreds of Afghans , including militants , in an ongoing US - led offensive across southern Afghanistan .
The deadliest fighting in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 has killed more than 500 people , mostly militants , since mid - May and raised fears of a Taliban resurgence .
Two British special forces soldiers were among the latest casualties when their Land Rover was ambushed early yesterday .
Afghan officials have said the Taliban is making an all - out push to scare Britain , Canada , the Netherlands and Romania from deploying some 6,000 troops to the region .
Nato is scheduled to expand its peacekeeping mission from 9,000 to 16,000 by the end of next month when it takes over responsibility for the dangerous southern region .
Later this year , it hopes to complete its expansion by moving into the eastern sector , which will likely take its total number to 21,000 .
Meanwhile , the US is hoping to reduce its troop numbers this year from 19,000 to 16,000 .
Many of the remaining US troops will be incorporated into the Nato force , notably in the eastern region , where Americans will be the lead nation under the Nato command .
Britain is taking command in the south , Germany commands the north , and Italy the west .
The US will also maintain a smaller combat force independent of Nato with the aim of hunting down Taliban and al - Qaida fighters .
Last week , a clearly frustrated Mr Karzai criticised the coalition 's anti - terror campaign and appealed for more help for his government .
He did not repeat that criticism with Ms Rice by his side , and the US secretary of state gave little sign that she was worried about the direction of the fight against terror , even while acknowledging the scope of the challenge . ""
This is an international force that is determined to try to undermine the aspirations of free people and they are not going to win , "" Ms Rice said .
"" We have to realise that we have a common enemy .
We can all do more .
We can all work harder we all need to constantly assess our strategy , look at our tactics , make certain that we are responding to their change in tactics , because this is a thinking enemy . ""
Outside Kabul , there is little evidence of improvements in infrastructure or services since the Taliban regime was ousted .
This has allowed forces loyal to the hardline Islamic regime to regain strength and sympathy in their former strongholds in the poorer southern provinces of Uruzgan , Helmand , Zabul and Kandahar ."
2006-07-11,"The US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , touched down in Afghanistan today , just hours after a US - led raid against a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country killed 30 insurgents .
Mr Rumsfeld is in Afghanistan to discuss with the president , Hamid Karzai , the resurgence of anti - government violence , in which more than 600 people , most of them suspected rebels , have died in the past two months .
US - led forces and Afghan troops killed 30 militants in a notoriously volatile district of Helmand province .
"" Early this morning , a joint Afghan - coalition raid resulted in the death of an estimated 30 extremist fighters , "" Lieutenant Tamara Lawrence told Reuters .
However , the US bombing raids are not without controversy .
This week , villagers said civilians had been killed and injured during an offensive in the southern province of Uruzgan .
The talks will also focus on plans for Nato to take over the command of the international security forces in the south from US forces in the coming weeks .
British , Dutch and Canadian troops are already deployed .
The defence secretary , Des Browne , announced yesterday the British force in southern Afghanistan will be increased to about 4,500 soldiers to challenge "" the impunity of the Taliban "" .
On his last visit to Kabul in December 2005 , Mr Rumsfeld said US troop levels would fall from 19,000 to 16,000 by this summer .
There are now 23,000 US soldiers in Afghanistan .
Since leaving the US for the region , Mr Rumsfeld has made it clear that Washington is concerned that large - scale drug trafficking in Afghanistan is helping fuel the resurgence of the Taliban .
Not only is the violence destabilising the south , it is also chipping away at the authority of President Karzai .
Most attacks have taken place in the south of the country , where the rugged terrain provides cover for Taliban guerrillas seeking refuge across the border in Pakistan .
Many analysts in the region say the Taliban problem in Afghanistan is an external one .
Some point the finger at Pakistan , others at Iran .
Perhaps most significant is the increasingly frosty relationship between the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan after Mr Karzai accused Islamabad of doing little to stop the insurgents .
General Pervez Musharraf said this was "" humbug "" .
Last month the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , shuttled between both capitals to defuse the war of words . ""
The Pakistani establishment has been unable or unwilling to rein in the new Taliban but left unchecked we risk seeing a new state running along the Pakistani - Afghanistani border which will destabilise the entire region , "" said TS Sreedhar , a defence analyst based in Delhi ."
2006-08-25,"Afghan president Hamid Karzai yesterday ordered an investigation into the killing of eight people in a raid that US forces claimed targeted al - Qaida members , according to a statement released by the presidency .
The US military said seven al - Qaida suspects and a child were killed in Thursday 's joint American - Afghan operation in eastern Kunar province 's Shigal district .
Police said civilians , not al - Qaida members , were targeted .
The statement said Mr Karzai had ordered a "" thorough investigation "" into the killings .
Kunar 's governor and local officials have gone on a fact - finding trip to the area ."
2006-09-06,"Afghanistan and Pakistan must join forces to fight al - Qaida and Taliban militants , Pakistan 's president General Pervez Musharraf said yesterday during a visit to Afghan president Hamid Karzai in Kabul .
He called for "" brotherly "" relations because both countries were battling the "" Talibanisation "" of society .
Pakistan 's tribal regions have witnessed expanding Taliban influence .
He also outlined a deal between Pakistani armed forces and tribal militants in North Waziristan , emphasising he would not allow the area to become a terrorist haven .
Mr Karzai said the deal was a positive step ."
2006-09-28,"President George Bush said yesterday that he would act as referee at a working dinner at the White House between the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan as public bickering between the two men threatens to destabilise the US "" war on terror "" .
Mr Bush said he would be watching the body language between President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Pakistan 's Pervez Musharraf at the dinner last night .
In recent weeks tension between the two over the sheltering of Taliban fighters in Pakistan has burst into the open .
In the latest edition of Newsweek magazine Mr Karzai accuses his Pakistani counterpoint of failing to act against senior Taliban members in his country . ""
Mullah Omar [ the Taliban leader ] is , for sure , in Quetta , Pakistan and he knows that .
We have given him the GPS numbers of his house and the telephone number . ""
In an increasingly maverick tour of US cities to publicise his autobiography , In the Line of Fire , Gen Musharraf has hit back .
"" None of this is true and Karzai knows it .
He knows this is not a problem created by Pakistan , "" he told CNN .
The Bush administration is dependent on cooperation between the two governments , both in the ongoing search for al - Qaida leaders and in the deteriorating war against the Taliban .
But the sniping between Mr Karzai and Gen Musharraf has grown steadily more public and intemperate since February .
A strong resurgence of the Taliban has led to fierce fighting in the southern Afghan provinces of Kandahar and Helmand .
Suicide bombings have exacted heavy losses among British and Canadian forces operating under the badge of Nato .
The fighting is stretching the capability of western forces , and comes as an embarrassment to Washington amid growing clamour over the situation in Iraq .
The White House refused yesterday to release the rest of a secret intelligence assessment depicting a growing terrorist threat to the US fuelled by the situation in Iraq .
The press secretary , Tony Snow , said releasing the full report , portions of which Mr Bush declassified on Tuesday , would jeopardise the lives of agents who gathered the information , Associated Press reported .
It would also risk the US 's ability to work with foreign governments and to keep secret its intelligence - gathering methods , Mr Snow said .
"" If they think their work is constantly going to be released to the public they are going to pull their punches , "" he said .
Much of the focus over Afghanistan now is on whether Gen Musharraf is genuine in his promises to clamp down on Taliban bases in Pakistan .
During a recent visit to Kabul , he said he would devote himself to the fight against the Taliban .
But suspicions have been raised among US and British observers by a deal this month between the Pakistan government and tribal leaders in North Waziristan .
The region is known to be used by insurgents who frequently cross from there into Afghanistan .
Under the pact , some militants will be allowed to stay as long as they abide by the law , and there are fears that this may create a haven for insurgents .
Manjeet Kripalani , a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York , said the historic pattern was for Pakistan to see Afghanistan as its vassal state . ""
Karzai will once again return home to Kabul a disappointed man unless the United States forces everybody , particularly Pakistan , to keep their promises . ""
Gen Musharraf 's position in the war on terror has been ambiguous from the start .
In his book , he admits that soon after the September 11 attacks he considered going to war against the US .
He weighed up the consequences and decided he would lose the war after , he claims , the US deputy secretary of state at the time threatened to bomb Pakistan "" back to the stone age "" ."
2006-09-28,"Pervez Musharraf , George Bush and Hamid Karzai : not all of them personal friends .
Photo :
Evan Vucci / AP President Bush might have taken pains to describe ( registration required ) the leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan as "" personal friends of mine "" while hosting them at the White House yesterday , but it 's unlikely they use such warm words for each other , writes Peter Walker .
In an interview with Newsweek magazine , Hamid Karzai insisted Pervez Musharraf knew perfectly well the location of the former head of the Taliban regime , but would not arrest him .
Mullah Omar is , for sure , in Quetta , Pakistan , and he knows that .
We have given him the GPS numbers of his house and the telephone number .
Gen Musharraf denies that , and is doing so while combining international statesmanship with a seemingly endless round of media engagements .
His most entertaining was an appearance on satirical new programme
The Daily Show , where host Jon Stewart elaborately poured his guest a cup of tea before asking casually : "" Where 's Osama bin Laden ? ""
Such media outings have left some uncomfortable , for example this post on the All Things Pakistan blog :
Many of Musharraf 's interviews ( 60 minutes , Today Show ) and the much - quoted contents of his book have been self - serving and in many cases outright embarrassing .
Disclosing [ former US deputy secretary of state ] Armitage 's bombing threat ; boasting that Pakistan has won large amounts of "" prize money "" by capturing terrorists as if it was a "" country for hire "" ; and the claim of success for the Kargil conflict has helped him sell books , but has made Pakistan look like a banana republic .
But the Pakistani newspaper The News decided that , on balance , it was a good thing for US audiences to "" be able to see a slice of life in contemporary Pakistan "" .
Though this may be through the eyes of a military man who overthrew an elected government , at least Pakistan is not in the news these days for honour killings or sectarian attacks .
It would be fair to say that General Musharraf has at least won the PR war during his US visit , if nothing else .
But relations with Mr Karzai are another matter .
Amateur psychologists noted keenly that the Pakistani president and his Afghan counterpart did not even shake hands with each other as they stood either side of Mr Bush at a press conference .
"" You know , "" Mr Bush himself said before the trio retired to a meal of spicy sea bass and salad , "" it 'll be interesting for me to watch the body language of these two leaders to determine how tense things are . """
2006-11-20,"Tony Blair today described the battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan as a "" generation - long struggle "" , as he met the country 's president , Hamid Karzai , in Kabul .
The prime minister said he did not expect British troops to remain in the war - torn state that long , but added that al - Qaida had "" deep roots "" in the country .
And he admitted that the British army had been through "" a very difficult past two or three months "" in Helmand province , where 36 soldiers have been killed since June .
Only five troops had been killed between 2001 and 2006 .
The two men held a 30-minute press conference in the Afghan capital under extremely tight security .
Pressed on whether the Taliban had "" time on their side "" and could simply wait for western troops to leave , Mr Blair conceded : "" Yes , the Taliban have got time , but the Afghan people have also got time .
They are not going anywhere , they are not going to be intimidated out of a better future . ""
"" Their game of waiting is a game that will not succeed . ""
In an apparent admission that public support for the continuing conflict in Afghanistan is waning , Mr Blair added that as well as making progress , "" it is important we show that progress has been made "" .
"" There is challenging news and there is good news , "" he insisted .
President Karzai added : "" Perhaps we have failed in our PR in London if we have not communicated our achievements in Afghanistan . ""
Mr Blair admitted that opium production was up in areas of Afghanistan , but insisted it was down in others . ""
For the Taliban to be ousted was a major defeat for them .
They will try to get back in and they will use their links with the drug trade to do that . ""
"" The Taliban thought they could retake Helmand this year - and they have n't . ""
"" If your enemy is fighting you - and they are our enemy - then you fight back with more energy and determination . ""
Earlier Mr Blair addressed troops in Camp Bastion , Helmand province , telling them the future security of the world would be decided on the battlefields of Afghanistan . ""
Here , in this extraordinary desert , is where the future of world security in the early 21st century is going to be played out , "" he said .
"" You may not know this , but people back home are very proud of what you do , regardless what they think of political leaders . ""
Mr Blair 's long - planned visit has been kept in strict hour - by - hour secrecy due to security fears .
Dressed in an open - necked blue shirt and navy blue blazer , Mr Blair spoke to around 800 members of the 4,500-strong Helmand taskforce , which includes 42 Commando Royal Marines .
Today , Mr Blair heard that there was support for the mission in Afghanistan among the troops .
Sergeant Chris Hunter , 31 , from Swansea , told Mr Blair : "" The lads , we all want to be here .
It is a point that is often missed back home that the lads are proud to be here and proud to be doing our job . ""
In total , Britain has around 6,000 service personnel in the country as part of the 31,500-strong Nato international security and assistance force .
The visit was Mr Blair 's second to the country .
On the previous occasion , in 2002 , shortly after the fall of the Taliban government , he was restricted to the Bagram airbase because of security fears .
The Liberal Democrat defence spokesman , Nick Harvey , said : "" Yet again the prime minister has failed to address the root problems of overstretch and equipment shortages facing our troops . ""
For as long as we aim to tackle the conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan without dealing with the fundamental operational difficulties this presents , it will be impossible to bring peace to either country .
"" It is time the prime minister addressed the true scale of the challenges and dangers facing our armed forces . ""
Yesterday , Mr Blair met Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistan president .
Gen Musharraf , the west 's leading Muslim ally , who urged Nato to change course in Afghanistan , arguing that the alliance could not rely solely on military might but also had to make political settlements and pump billions into the Afghans ' neglected economy .
Gen Musharraf likened the scale of the effort needed to the US Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after the second world war .
Mr Blair 's official spokesman insisted that there was no shortage of aid money for the country .
The UK has given £ 500 m in development aid while $ 10.5bn was pledged at an international donors conference in London in January .
The spokesman said : "" The problem at the moment is not the lack of financial aid available .
The problem is getting the physical infrastructure and government infrastructure in place to spend that money . ""
Gen Musharraf angrily rejected claims that Pakistan was failing to prevent militants crossing the border into Afghanistan to join the uprising .
He said that 600 Pakistani troops had been killed in fighting with the insurgents ."
2006-11-21,"President Hamid Karzai looked delighted .
Not since the BBC 's John Simpson , followed by the Northern Alliance , had marched into Kabul five years ago and liberated the city from the clutches of the Taliban had such a distinguished visitor been to his capital .
For the BBC 's political editor , Nick Robinson , had arrived , and he was doing a piece to camera .
True , there was another man called Blair banging on about the war on terror , but he could wait .
Earlier , Tony Blair - and the rest of the parliamentary lobby - had flown into Camp Bastion , the British headquarters in Helmand province in the south of Afghanistan , the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting involving British troops since the second world war .
The prime minister 's party had left their base camp in Islamabad as dawn broke ( 00.30 UK time ) , flying in an RAF Hercules C130 transport aircraft .
A khaki - clad woman with a pistol strapped to her thigh acted as air hostess .
As the heat rose , and with body armour dished out , the plane landed in what has been described as the "" hostile poppy fields of Helmand "" .
In fact , the British encampment lies in the flat , grey desert just north of Lashkar Gah , the provincial capital , in a place inhabited only by nomads .
Despite recent rain , the soil is so arid , not even a weed - let alone a poppy - would grow .
Gathered in a huge semicircle alongside the makeshift airstrip stood the British forces beside their kit , including Chinooks , Apaches , rifles , night goggle equipment and dogs capable of sniffing out explosives .
The bulk of the force came from 42 Commando Royal Marines and 2 Battalion Light Infantry .
As the prime minister , dressed in a blue blazer and blue open - necked shirt , spoke to different groups , snatches of conversation involved the deaths of friends , recent contacts with the enemy , and changing Taliban tactics .
Lieutenant Colonel Andy Price said : "" In the summer , we would come against 60 or 70 of them - now it is down to 10s and 20s .
We think we have hit them and they are having to rethink .
The aim is to disrupt their supply routes .
We try to interdict them at the crack of dawn , but they seem to be able to travel by the stars . ""
The army is also looking for quick wins in building wells , clearing rubble left over from fighting and installing toilets in schools .
It seems confident that the governor , Mohammad Daoud , is a straight man in a land rife with corruption .
He has also taken the difficult decision to disrupt poppy cultivation in the spring .
Helmand produces nearly half the country 's crop .
The British army is content to stand back from the eradication programme since it does not want to be seen to be responsible for depriving locals of their only worthwhile crop .
Brigadier Jerry Thomas , UK territorial force commander in Helmand , argued that many local farmers had been forced into poppy cultivation by drug traffickers who offered them loans to grow the crop and then locked them in a spiral of debt and dependency .
Barry Kavanagh , running the Department for International Development reconstruction work , is rueful .
"" It is incredibly difficult to stop .
Corruption is endemic .
This society is so complex and the insecurity is so great .
This is an area that could grow roses , pomegranates , saffron and cotton down by its river .
I fear that it 's going to take 10 to 15 years , but it is worth doing .
They have suffered 20 years of war . ""
Mr Blair jumped on a small podium to address the troops , telling them : "" You are here for a reason .
This was the training grounds for al - Qaida and terrorism , so when you defeated the Taliban , your defeat is not just on behalf of the people of Afghanistan , but the people of Britain and the wider world .
If this goes wrong in Afghanistan , the whole region feels the consequences .
Here in this extraordinary piece of desert is where the fate of world security in the early 21st century is going to be decided . """
2006-12-13,"The embattled Afghan president Hamid Karzai warned yesterday that his country 's enemies "" will burn in hell with us "" if Nato fails to stem a tide of Taliban violence emanating from neighbouring Pakistan .
Mr Karzai made the impassioned outburst in Kandahar , where tensions are running high after a spate of Taliban suicide bombings and angry accusations that British troops shot at least seven civilians .
Describing himself as a "" man of unbelievable deadly resolve "" , Mr Karzai warned that "" the whole region will run into hell with us "" if the rebellion was not quelled .
"" It 's not going to be like the past where only we suffer .
Those who cause us to suffer will burn in hell with us .
And I hope Nato recognises this , "" he said .
Mr Karzai renewed his attacks on Pakistan 's failure to stop cross - border attacks , and even suggested they have official sanction . ""
The problem is not with the Taliban , "" he said .
"" The problem is with Pakistan . ""
Asked if supporting the Taliban was a state policy , he said : "" The state of Pakistan was supporting the Taliban [ in the 1990s ] .
So we presume that ...
they are still being supported by a state element . ""
Outside the gates of the government guesthouse where Mr Karzai spoke , the fires of insurgency continued to burn .
In neighbouring Helmand a suicide bomber killed eight people outside the governor 's office .
The toll of the spiralling conflict has shown on Mr Karzai 's face on recent days .
On Sunday he cried during a speech in which he described a young girl who was badly injured during a Nato bombing raid against the Taliban .
"" I still get emotional when I think of her , "" he said yesterday .
"" When I saw that little girl in my office , I felt so helpless .
That is every Afghan child . ""
In Kandahar Mr Karzai also faced a barrage of accusations of civilian killings by British troops .
After being attacked by a suicide bomber on December 3 , a 20-vehicle British convoy sped through the city , opening fire on vehicles and motorcyclists .
Eyewitnesses told the Guardian that shooting occurred at five locations spread over six miles .
At least two people died and five were injured .
A British spokesman said the vehicles behaved in a threatening manner and the soldiers believed they could face a second attack .
But Mr Karzai said he was "" worried and rightly angered "" by the incident .
"" You can not go and shoot into people fearing another suicide attack .
You have to take other measures , "" he said .
General David Richards , the British commander of Nato troops in Afghanistan , said he was treating the shootings "" very seriously "" and awaiting the findings of a military investigation ."
2006-12-13,"Following a private meeting earlier this summer , a number of organisations have pledged to rebuild the 1,800-year - old Bamiyan buddhas in Afghanistan , blown up by the Taliban in 2001 .
Those leading the effort presented a virtual 3D reconstruction of the larger of the statues to members of the Afghan government , including President Hamid Karzai , in August .
The project will be led by Paul Bucherer - Dietschi , director of the Afghan Museum in Exile , along with Professor Armin Grün of the Swiss Institute of Photogrammetry in Zurich .
Bucherer - Dietschi says the statues represent an irreplaceable link between European art and eastern culture : "" The Buddhist grandsons and great - grandsons of Macedonian and Greek settlers built the statues in the Hellenistic style .
They are of profound importance . ""
He added that the restoration funds would not come from humanitarian aid . ""
The money to rebuild the buddhas is there , but I ca n't say yet where it came from . ""
Carved into the limestone mountainside 144 km west of Kabul , the buddhas were originally painted gold .
Though they were almost completely destroyed , their outlines and some features still remain .
Habiba Sarabi , governor of Bamiyan province , told me : "" When the work of stabilising the cliffs is finished , we will try to rebuild at least one statue .
But nothing could be achieved until at least 2009 . ""
She added : "" The people are poor , and many of the poorest live in caves in the cliff side - their first priority is to eat .
But a lot of them want to see the statues reconstructed .
The only thing we can do to bring change here is to develop tourism . ""
Dr Sarabi is also considering a proposal by 58-year - old Californian artist Hiro Yamagata to "" re - create "" the Buddhas using laser systems to project images of them on to the cliff where they once stood .
The project is currently pending Unesco approval . ""
The irony is that the destruction of the buddhas has aided archaeologists , says Unesco 's Christian Manhart .
"" When they were destroyed , people could see how they were built and were able to explore the caves behind them , many of which revealed ancient murals .
"" There will be another meeting this week at which further recommendations will be made .
Junko Okahashi of Unesco 's Central and South Asia Unit said reconstruction was being considered , but added : "" If we find that the memory of the buddhas could be transmitted better as empty niches , we might endorse leaving them as a better solution . """

"" We should be careful that we do n't overstate this unconventional military challenge , "" said Nato commander General James Jones .
Similar complacency was on offer last year from the former defence secretary John Reid when the additional British deployment was announced .
Since then , 4,000 or more people have died in insurgency - related violence .

2007-01-27,"The wife of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has given birth to their first child - a son they named Mirwais , Mr Karzai 's spokesman said yesterday .
Mirwais was born on Thursday evening in Kabul , and mother and son were doing fine , the spokesman , Karim Rahimi , said .
"" God gave him a son , "" Mr Rahimi added .
"" Karzai prayed for his son to serve the Afghan people . ""
Mr Karzai , 49 , married Zeenat in 1999 while she was working as a doctor with Afghan refugees in Pakistan , where he was in exile .
She rarely appears in public because of Afghan Islamic tradition ."
2007-02-15,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , last night urged Tony Blair to intensify pressure on Pakistan over the cross - border activities of Taliban and al - Qaida fighters .
Afghan officials have accused Britain of reluctance to apply pressure on President Pervez Musharraf to act because it needs Pakistan 's help in the fight against domestic terrorism .
Many of the most serious terrorist suspects , as well as at least two of the July 7 London suicide bombers , trained in Pakistani camps .
Britain is now seeking the extradition of Rashid Rauf , a Muslim of dual British - Pakistani nationality , and key suspect behind an alleged suicide plot to blow up airliners last summer .
President Karzai hinted at his concern at a Downing Street press conference when he said he expressed the "" hope "" that his neighbours would "" remain as steadfast "" as they were in the days after September 11 .
Mr Blair said it was in Britain 's interests to improve security across the border as British troops were threatened by the influx of fighters from Pakistan .
British officials said President Karzai was given assurances about Britain 's commitment .
Earlier , General David Richards , who recently handed over command of the 39,000 strong Nato force , said there were now sufficient troops in the country to contain the situation , but warned of an upsurge in Taliban attacks in the spring .
Building up the civil capacity in Afghanistan was essential in the battle for hearts and minds .
"" There is enough money .
The key is how quickly can it be spent and is it being spent at a pace that keeps pace with people 's expectations ? "" he said .
He was speaking at a conference organised by the security and development thinktank , the Senlis Council , which said the focus must be shifted away from the military struggle with the Taliban and towards economic and humanitarian support for ordinary Afghans .
A council report on Afghanistan said the eradication of poppy crops for heroin should stop .
Farmers should instead be licensed to produce opium for medical use ."
2007-02-19,"When a leader insists that his country will stay in a dangerous place "" until the job is done "" , the instinctive reaction is to wonder whether he means it .
Tony Blair and Hamid Karzai , meeting in London last week , exchanged the usual vows .
But both leaders know that the choices in Afghanistan are constrained by limitations of time , money , troops and political support .
A little more of each can no doubt be extracted but success in Afghanistan will come - if it comes - by a more skilful use of present resources and of the limited period before western electorates tire completely of the burden of intervention .
The problem is partly that the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq have been so intimately linked .
The ease with which Taliban forces were displaced in 2001 encouraged a misplaced optimism about the use of force in Iraq in 2003 .
Disasters in Iraq in turn affected the attention which the United States and its allies were ready to devote to Afghanistan .
It is true that greater success in Afghanistan would have had only a limited impact on Iraq , but the lack of it in Iraq has been directly damaging to Afghanistan .
As a process of what has been called "" Iraqification "" gathered momentum in Afghanistan , with more suicide bombings , ambushes , and assassinations , the military response was slacker than it should have been , and reconstruction was neglected .
The danger now is that the exhaustion felt in the United States and Britain over Iraq will undermine what hope there is for efforts in Afghanistan .
Interviewed yesterday , Tony Blair made it clear he hopes to cut troop numbers in Iraq soon .
Mr Blair once said of the decision to go into the country in 2001 that he could not "" recall a situation that has commanded so quickly such a powerful coalition of support "" .
Over Afghanistan there was an international readiness to endorse , or at least tolerate , a military attack as the necessary prelude to rescuing a failed state and a damaged society .
The follow - up was less than it should have been .
Even before they were distracted by Iraq , the Americans were only intermittently interested in the rebuilding of Afghan society , and their military effort went more into chasing al - Qaida than ensuring security for ordinary Afghans .
The division of military responsibilities between a fighting element and a peacekeeping element led on to today 's difficulties in which a supposedly united Nato force can not be flexibly employed because of caveats intended to keep many contingents out of harm 's way .
Pledges of aid flowed in , but the results on the ground were much less impressive .
Afghanistan became a place where governments could rhetorically demonstrate the solidarity with Washington that they had been obliged to withhold over Iraq , while discreetly limiting their real commitments .
Nor are they entirely to be blamed .
Iraq has made the public in western countries sceptical about all projects of intervention .
Romano Prodi , the Italian prime minister , is a typical case , holding the line against domestic critics who want an Italian withdrawal from Afghanistan , but also resisting Nato calls for more troops .
The outgoing Nato commander , Britain 's General David Richards , insisted recently that the war "" is very winnable "" .
In his time in Afghanistan , he constantly stressed the need for more aid and development and also argued for pragmatic arrangements that would bring some Taliban elements in from the cold .
His American successor is said to take a very different view .
Sharp differences between the confrontational approach of the Americans , who yesterday lost eight soldiers in a helicopter crash , the oblique strategy of the British , and the reluctant style of most of the other European Nato powers remain .
On top of these there are differences with the Karzai government over Pakistan .
Both the Taliban and Nato are preparing offensives .
It is going to be a hard year , and perhaps the critical year , in Afghanistan ."
2007-02-21,"Afghanistan Britain 's Nato partners were urged to do more in the coalition battle against Taliban forces in Afghanistan .
Foreign Office minister Kim Howells said some helicopters might as well be "" parked - up in leading European airports "" , the good they were doing in Afghanistan .
Ministers must demand improvements in Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's government before sending any more British troops to die for it , urged Labour 's Paul Flynn ( Newport W ) .
He said provincial governors and police chiefs appointed by Karzai were "" former war lords , former Taliban , one paedophile and people involved in the drugs trade "" .
Mr Howells insisted that "" saying we can not do anything in Afghanistan until we have proved that every single provincial governor is as honest as the driven snow is the road to nowhere "" .
MoD budget The defence ministry 's budget has been increased by more than £ 500 m partly to meet costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , the defence secretary , Des Browne , said .
The spending limit has now been set at more than £ 34bn with an extra £ 387 m needed "" to reflect the costs of peace keeping "" and conflict prevention .
The total projected costs for operations in 2006 - 07 now stand at £ 980 m for Iraq , £ 750 m for Afghanistan and £ 53 m in the Balkans .
Middle East
The foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , called on Syria to play a "" more constructive role "" in the Middle East .
She said Britain was seeking a better relationship with Damascus but was concerned over reports of arms smuggling to Hizbullah .
Darfur
The government would be prepared to press for sanctions against the Sudanese government if violence continues in Darfur , said Foreign Office minister Ian McCartney .
Labour 's Jim Dobbin ( Heywood and Middleton ) had called for "" travel bans "" and "" asset freezes "" on Sudanese ministers and the companies they owned .
Human rights in Russia Ministers came under cross - party pressure to push for improvements in human rights in Russia .
Labour former foreign office minister Denis MacShane said he was "" disappointed "" by Russian "" tactics "" and "" bullying rhetoric "" .
Minister for Europe Geoff Hoon told him human rights issues were regularly raised with Russian ministers .
Air passenger duty Gordon Brown 's doubling of air passenger duty is evidence of his "" contempt "" for parliament and sets a dangerous precedent for future stealth taxes , Tory former transport minister Christopher Chope warned .
He told a Westminster Hall debate the rise was not approved by parliament and therefore "" a constitutional outrage "" .
Suggestions
it was a green tax were "" baloney "" .
Treasury minister John Healey agreed APD was "" not the best policy "" but it delivered an environmental gain and provided resources for the government 's coming spending round .
The increase was entirely legal and in line with parliamentary conventions .
Windfall tax on development Plans for a windfall tax on development should make sure the money is used to fund improvements in the local area , Tories urged as the government came under fire over its proposed planning - gain supplement .
Ministers have said 70 % of the money raised in England will go to councils affected and 30 % will be allocated on a regional basis .
But Mark Francois , for Tories , said no such guarantees had been given for Scotland .
He added : "" There is no guarantee that a community in Scotland which is being asked to accept large - scale development will actually receive any reciprocal benefit at all . ""
Mr Healey said the planning - gain supplement ( preparations ) bill was just paving the way for possible legislation creating the supplement which the government was still consulting on .
Smoking ban on boats and ships Smoking will be banned on boats and ships in UK waters , the transport secretary , Douglas Alexander , said .
Under the plans to extend the ban on smoking in public places onto the nation 's waterways , sailors and passengers will still be allowed to smoke in their cabins .
Flouting the ban would carry similar penalties to those for smoking on dry land - a £ 50 on the spot fine and possible court action against premises .
Bird flu
The government moved to mitigate the threat of bird flu by allowing planning permission for farmers to shelter their birds in the event of further outbreaks .
Planning minister Yvette Cooper said the permission was granted across England so "" temporary and reversible works "" could be built to allow farmers to shelter poultry and other captive birds from contact with wild birds .
Former workers at MG Rover 's Birmingham plant More than 90 % of workers at MG Rover 's Birmingham plant who lost their jobs when the car giant collapsed have found new ones , trade and industry minister Margaret Hodge disclosed .

Of the remaining ex - workers , 358 are claiming job seeker allowance and 340 are claiming incapacity benefit , income support or pension credit .
Prisons
Some 18,507 prisoners were held in conditions officially classified as crowded last year , figures disclosed by Home Office minister Gerry Sutcliffe showed .
This compares with just 12,965 in 1998 - 99 .
Northern Ireland security bill
The justice and security ( northern ireland ) bill , following improvements in the security situation and last year 's St Andrews agreement , was backed in the Lords .
A key feature is jury reform and a shift away from non - jury "" Diplock courts "" - subject to a fall - back arrangement for exceptional cases .
Northern Ireland minister Lord Rooker said it would give the province 's police additional powers .
Lord Rooker added : "" It will bring Northern Ireland into line with arrangements for the rest of the UK and put greater checks on the security industry to ensure that those working in it are properly qualified to do so .
It marks a staging post in Northern Ireland 's continued transition to normalisation .
It also ensures that , while recognising progress , we do not ignore the threat that still exists .
"" Income tax Plans to re - write more than two centuries of income tax laws were backed by MPs .
In debate on the income tax bill , Mr Healey said the aim was to make the law clearer and easier to use .
The measure , the third of a series , will complete the HM Revenue and Customs tax law re - write project 's work on income tax .
The project , set up by the , then chancellor , Tory Kenneth Clarke , in 1996 , enjoys cross - party support , Mr Healey said .
"" It 's a project to re - write the UK direct tax code , the provisions of which have been enacted over more than two centuries .
"" Discrimination against Catholics
The government 's attitude towards the Catholic Church on gay adoption was compared with persecution of Catholics under Queen Elizabeth I and Henry VIII .
Tory former minister John Gummer ( Suffolk Coastal ) said discrimination against the Catholic Church was the opposite of toleration .
His Catholics ( prevention of discrimination ) bill would get rid of the "" historic discrimination "" against Catholics , including the ban on the heir to the throne marrying one .
It received a first reading but stands no chance of becoming law .
Today in parliament The prime minister and the Tory leader face each other at question time .
Earlier the Welsh secretary , Peter Hain , and his ministers respond to MPs .
The Tories open a debate .

2007-02-26,"As Britain prepares to send more troops to Afghanistan , a rally last weekend in Kabul threatens to derail the international compact surrounding the country 's reconstruction .
Around 30,000 people attended a rally in the Ghazi soccer stadium , which was once used as a Taliban torture execution centre , to press President Hamid Karzai to approve an amnesty law covering 25 years of war crimes .
A bill has already been passed by both houses of Afghanistan 's parliament granting an amnesty to those of its members who are accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity .
However , Karzai has still not signed it into law as it clearly contradicts Afghanistan 's own constitution and international obligations .
The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission has already condemned the proposed law for "" promoting impunity "" .
The issues at stake are considerable and show how misguided western policy towards Afghanistan has become .
The British government should take a clear position on this before any more British soldiers are asked to risk their lives in the country .
Afghanistan has become increasingly conflated with Iraq in the public mind , which makes it difficult to discuss what has gone wrong with current policy - making .
One crucial distinction is that while Iraq suffered an all - out invasion , the initial US intervention in Afghanistan was restricted to air strikes and the deployment of a handful of special forces to support the Northern Alliance in their ongoing fight against the Taliban .
There were virtually no international troops in Afghanistan when the Taliban forces were routed out and the Northern Alliance forces effectively seized control of the country .
An international conference of various anti - Taliban Afghan leaders was convened in Bonn at the end of 2001 .
This appointed Karzai , a Pashtun , as interim President and laid down a framework for agreeing a constitution and holding elections .
Afghanistan was to be bound by its international human rights obligations and it was agreed to establish a mechanism to hold perpetrators of grave violations to account .
Unfortunately , most of the international support promised never materialised .
A small UN - mandated international security force was deployed but remained confined to Kabul for the first few years .
Lawlessness increased and various warlords carved out local fiefdoms .
A recent report by Human Rights Watch named a number of very senior members of the current government as war criminals , including : the former minister of defence Mohammed Qasim Fahim , the former President Burhanuddin Rabbani , the minister of energy Ismail Khan , army chief of staff Abdul Rashid Dostum , and the current vice - president Karim Khalili , along with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a warlord based in south eastern Afghanistan .
All of these figures will be covered by the proposed new amnesty law , even though Hekmatyar is currently fighting alongside the Taliban .
A climate of impunity has been created in which aid workers have become regarded as "" legitimate targets "" .
Several of my friends and colleagues were murdered while I was in Afghanistan .
In at least some of the attacks - the murders of five Medecins Sans Frontieres workers in June 2004 , the kidnapping of three UN workers that October and the murder of Steve MacQueen in March of the following year - suspicions remain about who actually carried them out .
On one occasion I was in a compound that came under mortar fire , which was almost certainly fired by a former police chief , protesting his dismissal .
This climate has also played a direct role in the revival of the Taliban , who first swept to power a decade ago on a "" tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime "" platform .
Although my Afghan friends universally detested the Taliban , it was not uncommon to hear people contrast the stability that they established with the lawlessness that has swept the country since their demise .
The current impasse points to a systematic failure by western policy - makers to plan strategically for Afghanistan 's future .
The initial failure to deploy an effective international peacekeeping force and the holding of elections in a climate where warlords were bound to hijack the new parliament were entirely predictable mistakes .
Allowing the amnesty bill to become law would be another triumph of short - term and cowardly expedience over principle and strategic vision .
The bill is unconstitutional and should be struck down on that basis .
If the bill is enacted the British government should immediately press the UN security council to refer Afghanistan to the international criminal court .
Afghanistan has ratified the court 's statute and the enactment of the amnesty bill would be a clear sign that the domestic courts are unable or unwilling to prosecute perpetrators of crimes within its jurisdiction .
This move could cause some problems for the current US administration , given its hostility to the international court , but there is no other mechanism for holding perpetrators to account .
If Tony Blair is reluctant to do this , he must clearly explain why British soldiers are being asked to risk their lives to defend the political careers of Afghan war criminals ."
2007-02-27,"A Taliban suicide bomber killed up to 23 people , including two soldiers , outside a US military base in Afghanistan during a visit by Dick Cheney today .
The Taliban said it was responsible for the explosion , at the entrance to the Bagram base , which it said had targeted the US vice - president .
Mr Cheney is in Afghanistan for talks with the president , Hamid Karzai , about how to tackle the increasing violence in the country .
Speaking to reporters after leaving Afghanistan on a military plane , the US vice president said he had heard a "" loud boom "" and was briefly moved to a bomb shelter .
"" They clearly try to find ways to question the authority of the central government , "" he said .
"" Striking at Bagram with a suicide bomber , I suppose , is one way to do that . ""
Colonel Tom Collins , a Nato spokesman , said the bomber had run through an Afghan police checkpoint at the outer perimeter of the base before detonating his explosives in a crowd of people .
Mr Cheney met Mr Karzai in the capital , Kabul , around two hours after the bombing .
There were conflicting reports on the death toll .
Mr Karzai 's office said 23 people , including 20 Afghan workers at the base , had been killed and another 20 people injured .
A statement from NATO 's International Security Assistance Force said initial indications were that three people , including a US soldier , an American contractor and a South Korean soldier , had been killed .
Qari Yousef Ahmadi , a purported Taliban spokesman , confirmed that Mr Cheney had been the target of the attack , which he said had been carried out by Mullah Abdul Rahim .
"" We knew that Dick Cheney would be staying inside the base , "" Mr Ahmadi told the Associated Press .
US Major William Mitchell questioned that claim , pointing out that Mr Cheney 's overnight stay had happened only after a meeting with Mr Karzai was cancelled because of bad weather .
"" I think it 's a far - fetched allegation , "" he said .
"" The vice president was n't even supposed to be here overnight , so this would have been a surprise to everybody . ""
The explosion happened near the first of at least three gated checkpoints through which vehicles must pass before gaining access to Bagram .
The sprawling base houses 5,100 US troops and 4,000 other forces and contractors .
High security areas within the base are blocked by their own checkpoints .
It was unclear how an attacker could expect to penetrate the base , locate Mr Cheney and get close to him without detection .
"" We maintain a high level of security here at all times , "" Lieutenant Colonel James E Bonner , the base operations commander , said .
"" Our security measures were in place and the killer never had access to the base . ""
"" When he realised he would not be able to get on to the base , he attacked the local population . ""
However , the bombing - the closest militants have come to a US leader visiting Afghanistan - is likely to have propaganda value for the resurgent Taliban .
The suicide blast , one of the largest in recent months , demonstrated the Taliban 's confidence in attacking secure western installations , even if they rarely breach heavy security measures .
Last year , a suicide bomber struck outside the US embassy in Kabul , 40 miles to the south , killing two US soldiers and 11 civilians .
Suicide attacks in Afghanistan have jumped from negligible levels in 2004 to 139 last year .
Around 77 % of the victims are civilians , according to the UN ."
2007-04-09,"The Taliban will kill four Afghan medical personnel and their driver unless the government releases two Taliban commanders , a purported spokesman for the group said yesterday .
The threat came a day after the militia beheaded Ajmal Naqshbandi , an Afghan translator seized last month along with an Italian reporter , after authorities refused to repeat the much - criticised swap for imprisoned Taliban militants that won the Italian 's freedom .
President Hamid Karzai condemned the killing as the work of "" enemies of Afghanistan "" , while Afghan journalists staged a protest in the capital .
A spate of abductions has highlighted the lawlessness of southern Afghanistan , where the Taliban remain strongest , despite the presence of thousands of foreign troops .
The kidnappings have also kicked off a debate over the ethics of negotiating with kidnappers .
The Taliban said they had captured a doctor , three nurses and their driver on March 27 in Kandahar province , next to Helmand . ""
If the government does not release our two Taliban commanders , then we will give the same punishment as we did with Ajmal [ Naqshbandi ] , "" Shahabuddin Atal , told Associated Press yesterday , claiming to speak for the senior Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah ."
2007-06-12,"A communications breakdown between US troops and Afghan security forces led today to the killing of seven policemen , mistaken for Taliban , at a remote checkpoint in the east of the country when US forces on the ground called in an air strike .
The Afghan prime minister , Hamid Karzai , and other ministers have been complaining about the lack of coordination and intelligence sharing between US and Nato forces and their Kabul counterparts .
They regard it as a serious problem that has contributed to the rise in civilian casualties .
Incidents such as today 's , contribute to resentment of the US - led forces and support for the Taliban .
Major Chris Belcher , a spokesman for the US - led coalition in Kabul , said today a US unit had been approaching at night a suspected Taliban safe house in Nangarhar province .
"" They were ambushed from both sides with rocket - propelled grenades .
They returned fire and called in air suppport , "" he said .
He added that the US coalition was still looking into what had happened .
Similar communication failures have stemmed from a general lack of trust by the US forces in the ability of the Afghan government and security forces to keep secrets and partly from a language problem .
The Afghan defence department has protested repeatedly about not being informed about US air strikes until hours after they have taken place .
Mr Karzai 's spokesman , Karim Rahimi , described the deaths as a tragic incident caused by lack of communication . ""
The police forces were not aware of the coalition 's operation .
The police checkpoint in the area thought that they were the enemy , so police opened fire on the coalition , and then the coalition thought that the enemies were firing on them , so they returned fire back . ""
He said the incident demonstrated why Mr Karzai has repeatedly called for increased cooperation and communication between Afghan and international troops , which would also help solve the ongoing problem of civilian casualties in Afghanistan .
A policeman at the checkpoint , Khan Mohammad , told the Associated Press the police called out for the approaching US forces to halt .
"" I thought they were Taliban , and we shouted at them to stop , but they came closer and they opened fire .
"" I 'm very angry .
We are here to protect the Afghan government and help serve the Afghan government , but the Americans have come to kill us , "" he said .
The incident came only hours before the International Committee of the Red Cross reported that the impact of violence on civilians was worse now than a year ago .
Pierre Kraehenbuehl , the ICRC 's director of operations , said : "" Civilians suffer horribly from mounting threats to their security , such as increasing numbers of roadside bombs , suicide attacks and air strikes . ""
He said fighting between insurgents and the Afghan army , supported by international forces , had intensified significantly in the south and east of the country since 2006 and was spreading to the north and west .
Dr Barnett Rubin , a specialist in Afghanistan at New York University , who was an adviser to the 2001 talks that led to the setting up of the Afghan government , said : "" The increase in civilian casualties , which the US government and Congress seem not to have noticed , is seriously eroding Afghan support for the Nato and coalition presence . ""
At this point , it is one of the main recruiting tools of the Taliban . ""
Des Browne , the British defence secretary , said today he would again raise the whole issue of civilian casualties in Afghanistan at a meeting later this week with Robert Gates , his US counterpart .
"" I 've focused on this issue , as has Bob Gates , the Canadian defence minister , and the Nato secretary general , "" he told defence correspondents .
He referred to "" limitations on aerial bombings "" , adding that he personally received weekly reports about the effects of British bombing operations in Afghanistan each week .
Jaap De Hoop Scheffer , the Nato secretary general , expressed concern about US bombing operations at a meeting with president Bush at his Texas ranch last month .
In a pointed statement after a meeting in Washington shortly after that with Mr Gates , Mr Browne said he had stressed "" just how important it is for Nato and its members to maximise our efforts in keeping the consent of the civilian population there in order to achieve our aims "" .
The statement added : "" We also need to heed president Karzai 's words and take the greatest possible care to protect civilians during military operations to defeat the Taliban . ""
British officials , both civilian and military , are seriously worried about the impact of bombing operations and what they regard as other overzealous tactics , particularly , but not only , by US forces ."

2007-07-01,"Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , has called for an investigation into reports that 45 innocent Afghans were killed in a Nato - led air assault in the south of the country , the latest in a series of attacks which an incensed public is calling "" civilian massacres "" .
Clashes began on Friday when Taliban fighters ambushed a joint US - Afghan military convoy , which was attempting to clear the Helmand river of Taliban positions .
The international forces , including British troops who suffered fatalities on Saturday and yesterday , then called in air strikes on houses in the village of Hyderabad , in Helmand 's Gereshk district where they said insurgents were sheltering .
Despite ongoing fighting , an Afghan team of investigators was able to establish that 62 Taliban were also killed during the attack , said Dur Ali Shah , the mayor of Gereshk , and Muhammad Hussein Andewal , the provincial police chief .
Hyderabad resident
Muhammad Khan told the Associated Press that the air strikes killed seven members of his family , including his brother and five of his brother 's children .
A "" lot of dead bodies "" were buried on Saturday , he said by telephone .
The International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) admitted some innocent villagers had died but denied the toll reported by the two Afghan officials .
"" We had evidence of less than one dozen apparent civilians who were killed in that engagement , "" said Major John Thomas , spokesman for Isaf , the Nato - led force tasked with bringing stability to Afghanistan .
Isaf has repeatedly lamented the Taliban 's tactic of dispersing among the Afghan population , blaming them for innocent loss of life . ""
The civilian dead that we surveyed were in a trench line , in an enemy position , where the Taliban were using heavy machine guns , mortars , small arms and rocket propelled grenades , "" he said .
While Mr Karzai has condemned the Taliban for using human shields , he has also said the foreign soldiers consider Afghan lives "" cheap "" .
Maj Thomas said the Isaf would "" welcome Mr Karzai 's investigation and cooperate in any way possible "" .
The spokesman said that Friday 's decision to call for air support was taken under difficult circumstances .
"" Sometimes in a self defence situation we do not have perfect information in returning fire , this was the case in Hyderabad , "" he said .
"" We sometimes find later there were civilians hidden from our view and our knowledge , but it does n't absolve Isaf troops from our responsibility not to kill civilians . ""
But with more than 230 civilians killed this year , many incidents including women and children , convincing the Afghan population of their good intentions is becoming increasingly difficult .
Under increasing pressure from Mr Karzai 's government and outrage from the Afghan population , Maj Thomas acknowledged "" there is always more we can do "" .
He said the forces met local councils before each major operation to inform them of the risks to civilians and that local scouts and surveillance were used where possible to look for non - combatants .
The fighting , part of an operation to clear the Taliban from the banks of the Helmand river , continued throughout the weekend with sporadic battles between Isaf and insurgents .
Meanwhile officials from the UN , Nato and the Afghan government will meet in Rome today this week in Rome to discuss Kabul 's "" law and order "" agenda .
Mr Karzai , Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary general , and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , the Nato secretary general , will all attend the conference beginning today .
"" The era of lawlessness and corruption and unprofessional police and an unreliable justice system must end , "" the UN 's special representative to Afghanistan , Tom Koenigs , said in Kabul last month ."
2007-07-14,"Britain 's most senior generals have issued a blunt warning to Downing Street that the military campaign in Afghanistan is facing a catastrophic failure , a development that could lead to an Islamist government seizing power in neighbouring Pakistan .
Amid fears that London and Washington are taking their eye off Afghanistan as they grapple with Iraq , the generals have told Number 10 that the collapse of the government in Afghanistan , headed by Hamid Karzai , would present a grave threat to the security of Britain .
Lord Inge , the former chief of the defence staff , highlighted their fears in public last week when he warned of a ' strategic failure ' in Afghanistan .
The Observer understands that Inge was speaking with the direct authority of the general staff when he made an intervention in a House of Lords debate . '
The situation in Afghanistan is much worse than many people recognise , ' Inge told peers . '
We need to face up to that issue , the consequence of strategic failure in Afghanistan and what that would mean for Nato ...
We need to recognise that the situation - in my view , and I have recently been in Afghanistan - is much , much more serious than people want to recognise . '
Inge 's remarks reflect the fears of serving generals that the government is so overwhelmed by Iraq that it is in danger of losing sight of the threat of failure in Afghanistan .
One source , who is familiar with the fears of the senior officers , told The Observer : ' If you talk privately to the generals they are very very worried .
You heard it in Inge 's speech .
Inge said we are failing and remember Inge speaks for the generals . '
Inge made a point in the Lords of endorsing a speech by Lord Ashdown , the former Liberal Democrat leader , who painted a bleak picture during the debate .
Ashdown told The Observer that Afghanistan presented a graver threat than Iraq . '
The consequences of failure in Afghanistan are far greater than in Iraq , ' he said .
' If we fail in Afghanistan then Pakistan goes down .
The security problems for Britain would be massively multiplied .
I think you could not then stop a widening regional war that would start off in warlordism but it would become essentially a war in the end between Sunni and Shia right across the Middle East . ' '
Mao Zedong used to refer to the First and Second World Wars as the European civil wars .
You can have a regional civil war .
That is what you might begin to see .
It will be catastrophic for Nato .
The damage done to Nato in Afghanistan would be as great as the damage done to the UN in Bosnia .
That could have a severe impact on the Atlantic relationship and maybe even damage the American security guarantee for Europe . '
Ashdown said two mistakes were being made : a lack of a co - ordinated military command because of the multinational ' hearts and minds ' Nato campaign and the US - led Operation Enduring Freedom offensive campaign against the Taliban .
There was also insufficient civic support on , for example , providing clean water .
Ashdown warned : ' Unless we put this right , unless we have a unitary system of command , we are going to lose .
The battle for this is the battle of public opinion .
The polls are slipping .
Once they go on the slide it is almost impossible to win it back .
You can only do it with the support of the local population . '
There is a very short shelf life for an occupation force .
Once that begins to shift against you it is very very difficult to turn it round . '
The warnings from Ashdown and the generals on Afghanistan will be echoed in a report this week by the all - party Commons defence select committee .
MPs will say that the combination of civilian casualties , war damage and US - led efforts to eradicate lucrative poppy crops risk turning ordinary people towards the Taliban .
Stepped - up reconstruction efforts are essential , the MPs will suggest , in order to ensure local residents understand the longer - term aim of the British - led Nato mission - a point echoed , during the committee hearings on Afghanistan earlier this year , by returning British commander General David Richards .
The report is also expected to criticise some Nato members for failing to provide sufficient troops or other support for the Afghan mission .
Adam Holloway , a Tory member of the committee who is a former Grenadier Guards officer , said : ' We are getting to the point where it will be irretrievable .
That 's where we are now .
We are in danger of a second strategic failure [ after Iraq ] , which we can not afford . '"
2007-07-16,"A 14-year - old boy described yesterday how he was forced at gunpoint by the Taliban to put on a suicide vest and attack an Afghan provincial governor , part of an apparently growing tactic by the Taliban to use children against their enemies .
Rafiqullah was pardoned by the president , Hamid Karzai , and sent home to Pakistan with $ 2,000 after he told of how he was recruited at a Pakistani madrassa , encouraged to cross the border on foot , and finally supplied with an explosives - laden vest .
He was apprehended before he could carry out the attack . ""
Today we are facing a hard fact ; that is , a Muslim child was sent to madrassa to learn Islamic subjects , but the enemies of Afghanistan misled him towards suicide and prepared him to die and kill , "" Mr Karzai told reporters . ""
His family thought their child was learning Islamic studies .
I pardon him and wish him a good life . ""
Rafiqullah 's father , a poor tradesman from South Waziristan in Pakistan , had sent his son to a religious school , or madrassa , to learn the Qu'ran .
Later , when he asked where his son was , the teachers there brushed him off , he said .
When Rafiqullah balked at being given the suicide mission , he was threatened by a man named Abdul Aziz , he said .
"" I said I was afraid to carry out the suicide attack .
Abdul Aziz pointed a gun at me and said ' I 'll kill you if you do n't ' , "" Rafiqullah told the Associated Press .
Last month a six - year - old boy in Ghazni province said that Taliban militants had forced him to put on a suicide vest and walk up to American soldiers - a potential attack foiled when the boy instead asked Afghan soldiers for help .
A gory Taliban video which surfaced in April showed militants in Pakistan instructing a boy aged about 12 as he beheaded an alleged traitor with a knife .
Rafiqullah said at least two other boys his age had been indoctrinated to carry out suicide attacks at his madrassa .
In Pakistan itself , suicide bombers struck in two areas of the north - west at the weekend , killing around 40 people and aggravating concern of a militant backlash to last week 's rout of extremists at the Red Mosque in Islamabad ."
2007-07-23,"Mohammad Zahir Shah , the last king of Afghanistan who returned from three decades of exile to support his war - battered country 's moves towards democracy , died today , aged 92 . ""
With paramount grief , I would like to inform my countrymen that ...
Mohammad Zahir Shah has bid farewell to this mortal world , "" Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , said .
The Reuters news agency reported that state television interrupted its normal broadcast for a woman , dressed in black , to announce the death .
Prayers and recitals from the Qur'an followed .
The former king , who had left Afghanistan several times for medical treatment , died in his bed after months of illness .
Describing him as the founder of Afghanistan 's democracy and a symbol of national unity , Mr Karzai announced three days of national mourning for the former king and ordered flags to be flown at half - mast .
His body will lie in state at a mosque in Kabul before being buried in a mausoleum next to his father on a hill overlooking the city .
Weak , if well meaning , during his 40-year reign , Zahir Shah was a symbol of peace and unity in a country still struggling to emerge from the turmoil that began with his 1973 ouster in a palace coup .
When the fall of the Taliban in 2001 offered fresh hope for national reconciliation , many demanded Zahir Shah 's return - not only from exile but to retake the throne .
He returned from Italy in April 2002 but stood aside in favour of a young anti - Taliban tribesman , Mr Karzai .
A new constitution passed in January 2004 consigned the monarchy to history , with Zahir Shah named the ceremonial "" Father of the Nation "" , a position that will disappear with his death .
Born in 1914 , Zahir Shah was proclaimed monarch at the age of 19 within hours of witnessing the assassination of his father , King Mohammad Nadir Shah .
He was not a dynamic ruler , with uncles and cousins holding the real power for most of his reign during which Afghanistan remained poor and forgotten .
But his neutral foreign policy and limited liberalisation of a conservative society managed to keep the peace - a golden age in the eyes of many Afghans pained by the extremism and slaughter that followed ."
2007-07-23,"American and Afghan soldiers surrounded a district in central Afghanistan where 23 South Korean Christian aid workers were being held hostage last night as their Taliban captors extended a deadline for their demands by 24 hours .
The insurgents , who snatched the South Koreans from a bus at gunpoint on Thursday , have threatened to start executing the group unless an equal number of imprisoned fighters are freed .
Intensive negotiations involving President Hamid Karzai , Korean hostage negotiators and local tribal elders were under way last night as tearful relatives held a candlelight vigil outside the aid workers ' church in Seoul .
The sense of urgency grew after the body of a German engineer , who had been abducted in a separate incident , was found in Wardak province near Kabul .
The Taliban said they killed the man .
Last night Germany said his body had gunshot wounds .
A German foreign ministry spokesman said the exact cause of death was unclear and Berlin wanted the remains returned to Germany as soon as possible for a closer examination .
The Christian aid workers including 18 women were abducted from a public bus travelling from Kandahar to Kabul on one of Afghanistan 's most dangerous routes .
They included nurses and English teachers in their 20s and 30s .
They apparently tried to disguise themselves by wearing all - covering burkas .
An eight - strong team from the South Korean government established contact with the kidnappers as American and Afghan security forces encircled the area in central Ghazni province where the hostages were believed to be held .
A western security official in the area said he did not expect an immediate raid .
"" I do n't think there 's an intention to try something big and brave .
They just want to make sure that the hostages do n't go anywhere . ""
Taliban spokesman Qari Muhammad Yusuf said the hostages were being kept in different locations and any attempt to use force would have "" dire consequences "" .
But the insurgents were extending their deadline by 24 hours to 3.30pm BST today because "" the Islamic emirate is keen to resolve this issue peacefully "" .
The UN secretary general Ban Ki - Moon , who is from South Korea , vowed to help obtain the captives ' release .
South Korea has 200 soldiers in Afghanistan under American command , mostly engaged in medical or humanitarian duties .
They are due to leave at the end of this year .
But Afghanistan retains a curious attraction for South Korean evangelicals .
Proselytising is illegal in Afghanistan and the Taliban have threatened to kill missionaries who secretly enter the country .
Last year the government deported 1,200 South Koreans who flew to Kabul for a "" peace parade "" that never took place .
The South Korean embassy in Kabul strongly denied that the hostages , who belong to the Saemmul Christian Church from Bundang near Seoul , were engaged in missionary activity .
A western security official told the Guardian that they ran a small and discreet medical charity in Kandahar .
"" It 's a small and unobtrusive compound .
Most Afghans do n't even know it exists .
"" Relatives of the hostages fought back tears at a vigil in South Korea last night .
"" My only wish is for the Taliban to send our family members home safely , "" said Seo Jung - bae , father of two of the hostages .
But in Berlin the German chancellor Angela Merkel sounded a defiant note against Taliban demands for the immediate withdrawal of Germany 's 3,000 troops in exchange for a remaining hostage .
"" We will not give in to blackmail , "" she told a German channel ."
2007-07-23,"The return of King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan , who has died aged 92 , to his mountain kingdom in April 2002 after 29 years in exile , was in a sense an act of expiation .
Well - intentioned and patriotic , he was also indecisive and it was his failure to make a democratic system work by refusing to sign legislation authorising political parties and provincial and municipal councils that had helped to bring about his demise - and that of his country .
So he stood aside to allow Hamid Karzai to step up from being chairman of the transitional administration to interim president , and was given the title of "" father of the nation "" .
The new constitution of 2004 abolished the monarchy , and Karzai won that year 's presidential elections .
Deposed in 1973 after 40 years on the throne , Zahir Shah had watched helplessly as his country fell victim to a Marxist coup , invasion by the Soviet Union , civil war and , finally , the disaster of the Taliban .
In the wake of the attacks of September 11 2001 , the apparent rout of the Taliban by US forces and its allies and the formation of an interim Afghan government , the king was seen as the only Afghan capable of presiding over his country 's return to representative government .
He was proud of that last achievement .
Mohammad Zahir Shah was born in Kabul , educated at schools in Afghanistan and France , studied at the military academy and was groomed for office by his father , Nadir Shah , who made him assistant defence minister in 1932 and then acting education minister in 1933 .
In November that year he was proclaimed king after his father was assassinated in Kabul as the result of a personal vendetta .
Zahir Shah began his reign at the age of 19 .
His uncles , one of whom was prime minister , immediately rallied round and ran the country for the next 20 years , leaving him time to travel around Europe - he spoke several European languages in addition to Pashto and Farsi - and preside over ceremonial occasions .
Perhaps surprisingly there was no struggle for power , and the tall , handsome young king enjoyed a peaceful start to his reign .
In 1934 , Afghanistan joined the League of Nations and was formally recognised by the United States .
With the outbreak of the second world war , the king sensibly opted for neutrality and Afghanistan became the Switzerland of Asia , full of rival Allied and Axis spies and prospering from its exports of karakul skins and food .
In 1947 , with Britain withdrawing from India and the Soviet Union exerting increasing influence north of the border , the centuries ' old balance of power changed abruptly .
At partition , despite earlier promises , Britain refused to allow Pashtuns in the north - west frontier to vote in favour either of independence or of joining Afghanistan .
Kabul reacted by promoting the cause of Pashtunistan - the king himself was a Pashtun .
This angered the new Pakistan government , which imposed an embargo on petroleum products .
The Soviet Union was quick to fill the gap , and to exploit a newfound influence .
Anxious , however , to see America take over the role of Britain as a counter - balance to the Soviets - Afghanistan had obtained full independence from Britain in 1921 - the Afghans asked America for both arms and aid , but with little success .
Disappointed on all fronts , in 1953 the king chose as prime minister a strong man he knew and trusted , his first cousin , Prince Mohammad Daoud .
Dynamic and authoritarian , Daoud advocated economic development , modernisation - women no longer had to wear the veil - and a hard line on Pashtunistan .
In 1956 , when the Americans turned down a second request for arms , Daoud turned to Moscow .
His popularity appeared to hold .
When President Eisenhower visited Afghanistan in 1959 , the US secret service were alarmed at the way in which ordinary Afghans were allowed to mob the royal limousine as king and president toured Kabul .
Relations with Pakistan , however , continued to deteriorate , and Daoud 's obsession with Pashtunistan finally undid him .
Tired of border raids , President Ayub Khan , the new military ruler of Pakistan , broke off diplomatic relations .
Kabul retaliated by closing the border , which was disastrous for trade and the Afghan economy plummeted .
In 1963 , as unrest mounted , Daoud resigned .
Daoud 's departure heralded a new atmosphere of freedom , encouraging the king to move towards a constitutional monarchy .
But the reforms were imperilled by the king 's characteristic caution .
Liberalism soon turned to licence , and student demonstrations to violence and deaths .
Against this background , the People 's Democratic ( ie . communist ) party of Afghanistan was born .
The 1969 election produced a swing to the right , but corruption , bureaucracy and the Soviet Union 's stranglehold were crippling the economy .
A three - year drought led to widespread famine , in which at least 100,000 people died .
Ironically , the king seemed to have made the right decision at last when , in 1972 , he appointed an energetic young technocrat , Moosa Shafiq , as prime minister .
Then , on July 17 1973 , with the king in Italy on holiday after treatment for eye injury in England , Daoud seized power in what was probably a long - planned coup .
Relations with the Soviet Union , initially good , deteriorated sharply when Daoud walked out of a meeting with President Brezhnev in 1977 .
The reckoning came a year later , in April 1978 , when Daoud was murdered in a bloody communist coup .
In December 1979 , the Soviet Union invaded , ushering in the long cycle of war and political anarchy that led to the Karzai government and the fleeting hope that the Taliban could be suppressed .
Meanwhile , Zahir Shah remained silent for most of his exile .
He spent his time in a villa in Rome , playing golf , chess and tending his garden .
But , according to friends , he never despaired of going home one day though after his return
he went abroad several times for medical treatment .
He married his wife , Lady Homira , in 1931 , and she died in 2002 .
They had two daughters and five sons .

Relations with Pakistan , however , continued to deteriorate , and Daoud 's obsession with Pashtunistan finally undid him .
Tired of border raids , President Ayub Khan , the new military ruler of Pakistan , broke off diplomatic relations .
Kabul retaliated by closing the border , which was disastrous for trade and the Afghan economy plummeted .
In 1963 , as unrest mounted , Daoud resigned .
Daoud 's departure heralded a new atmosphere of freedom , encouraging the king to move towards a constitutional monarchy .
But the reforms were imperilled by the king 's characteristic caution .
Liberalism soon turned to licence ; and student demonstrations to violence and deaths .
Against this background , the People 's Democratic ( communist ) party of Afghanistan was born .
The 1969 election produced a swing to the right , but corruption , bureaucracy and the Soviet Union 's stranglehold were crippling the economy .
A three - year drought led to widespread famine , in which at least 100,000 died .
Ironically , the king seemed to have made the right decision at last when , in 1972 , he appointed an energetic young technocrat , Moosa Shafiq , prime minister .
Then , on July 17 1973 , with the king in Italy , on holiday after treatment for an eye injury in Britain , Daoud seized power in what was probably a long - planned coup .
Relations with the Soviet Union , initially good , deteriorated sharply when Daoud walked out of a meeting with President Brezhnev in 1977 .
The reckoning came a year later , in April 1978 , when Daoud was murdered in a bloody communist coup .
In December 1979 , the Soviet Union invaded , ushering in the long cycle of war and political anarchy that led to the Karzai government and the fleeting hope that the Taliban insurgency could be suppressed .
Zahir Shah remained silent for most of his exile .
He spent his time in a villa in Rome , playing golf and chess and tending his garden .
But , according to friends , he never despaired of going home one day , though after his return he went abroad several times for medical treatment .
His wife , the former Queen Homaira , died in 2002 .
They had two daughters and five sons .

2007-08-01,"David Cameron will today meet British troops fighting the Taliban at the end of a two - day trip to Afghanistan during which he has urged other Nato countries to take on more of the military burden .
The Conservative leader flew to Kabul yesterday from the UK for what was originally intended to be the second leg of a visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The Pakistan leg was cancelled for security and logistical reasons but Mr Cameron landed in Afghanistan yesterday to meet Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , US General Dan McNeill , commander of Nato forces , and Sir Sherard Cowper , the British ambassador .
The visit to meet some of the 7,700 British troops stationed in the country today is to show "" cross - party support "" for their efforts , Mr Cameron said .
On Sunday , Michael Jones , a Special Boat Service commando , died in a gun battle , the 68th member of the British armed forces to die in the country since 2001 .
Mr Cameron was criticised by some of his Witney constituents last week for pressing ahead with a visit to Rwanda while there were floods at home .
He is due to go on holiday at the end of this week .
"" There is no room for complacency .
There are risks of failing in Afghanistan .
We can not afford to fail .
If we fail we will see an increase in terrorism , an increase in drugs , and dangerous instability in this region , "" he said .
Thirty - seven countries supply a total of 37,000 troops to the international security assistance force in Afghanistan ."
2007-08-01,"The Tory Leader , David Cameron , today called for greater support for British troops in Afghanistan .
Mr Cameron met the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , the overall commander of the Nato force in Afghanistan , US general Dan McNeill , and Britain 's ambassador in Kabul , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , on day one of a two - day fact - finding mission in the country .
He praised the work of troops but echoed recent concerns that Britain , the US , Canada , and the Netherlands have been left with too much to do . ""
Britain is definitely bearing its share of the burden .
We need more helicopters , we need more support and also we need other Nato countries to play their part , "" said Mr Cameron .
He warned that the failure of the international mission could have huge consequences for the Middle East and said a single individual should be appointed to mastermind the civilian reconstruction effort , a key tool in the battle to win hearts and minds .
"" We can not afford to fail .
If we fail we will see an increase in drugs and dangerous instability in this region , "" said Mr Cameron .
"" To make sure that we succeed , we have to take tough , gritty , hard - headed decisions about making sure that there is a greater unity of purpose about what we are doing here . ""
Tomorrow , Mr Cameron will meet British troops fighting the Taliban in Helmand province in the south of the country .
He had originally intended to visit Pakistan as well but aides said the plan was scrapped because of concerns about the country 's volatile political and security situation .
He will be hoping the visit deflects attention from the internal dissent within the Conservative party about his "" modernising "" agenda .
Mr Cameron last night suspended Ali Miraj , who had accused the Tory leader of an obsession with "" PR and gimmicks "" , from the Conservatives ' A - list of would - be MPs but Mr Miraj hit back with further criticism .
Mr Cameron has had to contend with the fallout from the double byelection disappointment , in Ealing Southall and Sedgefield , poor opinion poll ratings , and criticism of his trip to Rwanda last week while his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire was engulfed by floods ."
2007-08-06,"President George Bush insisted today the US would take out Osama bin Laden and other al - Qaida leaders believed to be hiding in Pakistan if he had "" actionable intelligence "" .
He refused to say whether he would seek permission first from Pakistan 's president , Pervez Musharraf .
He was speaking during a press conference at the presidential retreat , Camp David , with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , which exposed the tensions in Washington and Kabul over the suspected presence of al - Qaida and Taliban leaders in Pakistan 's tribal areas , and the perceived failure of the Pakistan government to take action .
Mr Bush has faced increasing criticism that Iraq has been a distraction and that he should have kept the focus on capturing Bin Laden and destroying the Taliban .
One of the Democratic frontrunners in the 2008 presidential race , Barack Obama , said last week that , if he was president , he would send US forces in to get Bin Laden if President Musharraf , failed to take action .
His comments led to protests by the Pakistan government .
At the press conference , Mr Bush was asked if he would wait for Mr Musharraf 's permission , even if it meant missing an opportunity to take out the al - Qaida leaders .
Mr Bush said : "" I am confident that with actionable intelligence , we will be able to bring top al - Qaida to justice .
We 're in constant communications with the Pakistan government .
It 's in their interest that foreign fighters be brought to justice .
After all , these are the same ones who were plotting to kill President Musharraf .
"" We share a concern .
With real actionable intelligence , we will get the job done . ""
Relations between the US and Pakistan have deteriorated sharply over the last year as the Bush administration put pressure on him to send troops into Warizstan , where Bin Laden is suspected to be hiding out .
In a sign of its increasing impatience with Mr Musharraf , the White House made public an intelligence report on July 17 , saying that al - Qaida has established safe havens in Pakistan .
Within two days , Mr Musharraf launched a new military offensive , ending an agreement with tribal leaders that had angered Washington .
He also moved against militants in the Red Mosque in Islamabad .
Relations between Mr Karzai and Mr Musharraf have also been strained , with the Afghanistan leader claiming repeatedly over the past year that Pakistan was providing a safe haven for the Taliban .
Pakistan denies this .
Mr Musharraf and Mr Karzai are scheduled to meet in Kabul on Thursday to try to reconcile their differences .
A notable split also opened up between Mr Bush and Mr Karzai over the alleged role of Iran in Afghanistan .
The US claims Iran has been arming the Taliban but Mr Karzai , in an interview on American television yesterday , described Iran as a "" helper "" in his country .
Mr Bush , while reluctant to contradict another leader in public , urged Mr Karzai to be "" very cautious about whether or not the Iranian influence there in Afghanistan is a positive force "" .
Mr Bush said : "" It 's up to Iran to prove to the world that they 're a stabilising force as opposed to a destabilising force . ""
He went on to claim that Iran was , after all , "" a government that has proclaimed its desire to build a nuclear weapon "" .
Tehran has repeatedly denied it has any ambition to build a nuclear weapon capability and that it is developing nuclear technology solely for civilian purposes .
The two leaders also discussed Mr Karzai 's complaint about US air attacks killing Afghan civilians .
Mr Bush insisted that the US military did all it could to protect the innocent and military operations were adjusted accordingly .
"" It is the Taliban who surround themselves with innocent life as human shields , "" he said .
In a separate development , Afghanistan and Russian finance ministers meeting in Moscow signed an agreement in which Russia wrote off 90 % of Afghanistan 's £ 5.5bn debt .
The remainder may be written off ."
2007-08-06,"Britain is pressing the US to accept the appointment of a major figure to represent the international community in Afghanistan , both to shore up the government of President Hamid Karzai and to coordinate the country 's reconstruction programme .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , has made Afghanistan his foreign policy priority , signalled by the large UK embassy there .
Mr Miliband visited Afghanistan and Pakistan when he took office in an attempt to underline the British belief that if Afghanistan falls , so could Pakistan , with huge implications for the UK 's internal security .
It appears the Americans are willing to see a major figure for Afghanistan appointed in Brussels and Geneva , but are less eager that the person is based in Kabul , possibly because it might muddle the military chain of command .
The US undersecretary of state , Nick Burns , has said the world needs a figure of the stature of Lord Ashdown in Afghanistan , a reference to the role the former Liberal Democrat leader played in Bosnia as the UN high representative .
Lord Ashdown , however , is reluctant , arguing that the mandate of such a figure is more important than the personality .
Afghanistan was discussed by Gordon Brown and George Bush when the two met at Camp David last weekend .
The prime minister notably described Afghanistan , not Iraq , as the front line in the battle against terrorism .
Lord Ashdown wrote last month in the Guardian that the country was in serious danger of collapse .
There was no effective coordination , with individual countries obsessed with their bilateral plans ."

2007-08-09,"Pakistan 's prime minister , Shaukat Aziz , acknowledged that the Taliban uses Pakistan as a base from which to mount attacks inside Afghanistan but denied the state was secretly supporting them .
Mr Aziz was addressing more than 600 tribal elders from Pakistan and Afghanistan at the start of a four - day jirga , or tribal council , that hopes to help end the bloody insurgency .
The jirga is the brainchild of Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai .
But critics say its effectiveness is stunted by the absence of elders from Waziristan , a major Taliban hub in northern Pakistan , and of President General Pervez Musharraf , who dropped out at the last minute .
Mr Aziz admitted that Pakistan - based militants slip across the porous border but also urged Afghans not to blame Pakistan for all their problems .
"" I will be frank - Afghanistan is not yet at peace within itself , "" he said .
"" The objective of national reconciliation remains elusive .
The Afghans ... can not blame others for failing to achieve .
This lies at the heart of the malaise in Afghanistan . ""
Accusations that Pakistan is secretly supporting the Taliban were "" not true "" , he added .
Mr Karzai said both countries need to tackle the Taliban together .
"" Afghanistan is not under fire alone now , "" he said .
"" Unfortunately our Pakistani brothers are also under fire , and this fire , day by day , is getting hotter . """
2007-08-09,"On Monday , the Iranophobia of US president George Bush was once again on display .
The occasion was the joint press conference he gave at his Camp David resort along with Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai .
Contradicting Karzai 's statement in a CNN interview on Sunday that Iran was "" a helper and a solution "" to his country
, Bush urged him to be "" very cautious about whether or not the Iranian influence there in Afghanistan is a positive force "" .
Such a statement could only come from someone ignorant of the recent history of Tehran 's relationship with its eastern neighbour .
Long before 9/11 , the Iranian regime was at loggerheads with the Taliban who captured Kabul in September 1996 .
As orthodox Sunnis of the Hanafi code , the Taliban held Shias in low esteem , and banned their annual ritual of Ashura .
When the Taliban authorities held a dozen Iranian diplomats hostage in Mazar - e Sharif in the summer of 1998 , relations between the two neighbours deteriorated to the point when a war between them seemed imminent .
In the end cool heads prevailed .
Iran withdrew the revolutionary guard troops it had amassed along the Afghan - Iranian border .
Following 9/11 , as the Bush administration prepared to attack the Taliban , the Iranians shared intelligence with it surreptitiously .
At their urging , Ismail Khan , the anti - Taliban Afghan leader based in the Iranian city of Mashhad , along with his fighters , coordinated his attack on the Taliban in western Afghanistan with the Pentagon 's campaign in the north and the east .
Ismail Khan 's militia captured Herat , an important city near the Iranian border .
At the international conference held in Bonn , Germany , in late December 2001 , Iran 's foreign minister , Kamal Kharrazi , actively co - operated with the Americans to install Hamid Karzai as the leader of the post - Taliban Afghanistan .
At the subsequent international donors ' gathering , in Tokyo , Iran pledged $ 500 m aid to Afghanistan over five years .
Unlike many other nations at the Tokyo conference , it has fulfilled its initial promise .
It has been involved in several infrastructure and health care projects , particularly in western Afghanistan .
In 2003 , when Ismail Khan , an ethnic Tajik , refused to send an envoy to Kabul when Karzai , an ethnic Pashtun , was formally installed as president , it was the Iranian government which persuaded him to fly his son for the inaugural ceremony .
In return , Karzai appointed Khan 's son as a cabinet minister .
Furthermore , ever since the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 , the Iranian regime has been battling the Afghan drug dealers who use Iran as a transit route for shipping their products to Europe .
In the course of hundreds of fire fights between the smugglers and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards ( charged with monitoring the national borders ) , a few thousand guards have lost their lives .
The anti - narcotic campaign by Iran , which has continued since the overthrow of the Taliban in December 2001 , has been praised not only by the Karzai government but also by the UN .
However , given Bush 's deep - seated aversion towards the Islamic Republic , it was unlikely that a brief history of Iran 's anti - narcotic campaign was conveyed to him during the "" more than a fair amount of time "" he spent with Karzai discussing the fact that Afghanistan accounted for 95 % of the world 's poppy production used to produce heroin .
Overall , in the light of the recent history of the region , Karzai 's description of Iran as "" a helper and a solution "" of Afghanistan was rooted in facts .
By contrast , Bush damaged his already low credibility in foreign affairs when he went on to claim that Iran had a government "" that has proclaimed its desire to build a nuclear weapon "" "" .
This statement is false .
On September 12 2004 , Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei issued a fatwa ( religious decree ) that it was "" un - Islamic "" to use an atom bomb .
In his Friday prayer sermon on November 5 2004 , Khamanei declared that "" developing , producing or stockpiling nuclear weapons is forbidden under Islam "" and for "" our believing nation "" , and added : "" They accuse us of pursuing nuclear weapons program .
I am telling them as I have said before that we are not even thinking about nuclear weapons . ""
( See Middle East International , Issue December 4 2004 . )
But then again , in George Bush the world is dealing with a politician who prides himself on acting on gut feeling - rather than facts , expertise or historical experience ."
2007-08-09,"Tension between British and American commanders in southern Afghanistan erupted into the open today as a senior UK military officer said he had asked the US to withdraw its special forces from a volatile area that was crucial in the battle against the Taliban .
British and Nato defence officials have consistently expressed concern about US tactics , notably air strikes , which kill civilians , sabotaging the battle for "" hearts and minds "" and infuriating Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president .
Des Browne , the defence secretary , recently raised the issue with Robert Gates , his US counterpart , and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , Nato 's secretary general , admitted last month that an increasing number of civilian casualties was undermining support for alliance troops .
He said Nato commanders had changed the rules of engagement , ordering their troops to hold their fire in situations where civilians appeared to be at risk .
Today , a senior British commander was quoted in the New York Times as saying that in Sangin , in the north of Helmand province , which had been calm for a month , there was no longer a need for special forces .
"" There are n't large bodies of Taliban to fight any more , "" he said .
"" We are dealing with small groups and we are trying to kick - start reconstruction and development .
"" Twelve - man teams of US special forces had been criticised for relying on air strikes for cover when they believed they were confronted by large groups of Taliban fighters and their supporters .
Unnamed British officers were quoted today as saying the US had caused the lion 's share of casualties in their area and that after 18 months of heavy fighting since British forces arrived in Helmand they were finally making headway in securing key areas , but were now trying to win back support from people whose lives had been devastated by bombing .
The newspaper estimated the number of civilian casualties this year in Helmand at close to 300 - most caused by foreign and Afghan forces , not the Taliban .
Human rights and aid groups estimate that 230 Afghan civilians were killed throughout the south of the country last year .
Nato officers admit they are troubled by the high toll .
One medic told the Guardian that during a 14-day period last month , British soldiers rescued 30 Afghan civilians wounded in bombings or firefights - half of whom were children .
The US and Nato today denied the British commander had asked US special forces to leave his area of operations .
However , Mr Browne , visiting British and Nato troops in Afghanistan , said the commander was expressing a personal view .
"" It is the reporting of an observation of a British officer on a particular part of the American military , "" he told reporters in Kabul .
"" That may be his view , but it is not the view of the Helmand taskforce commander , it is not the view of our government , it is not the view of the Americans , it is not the view of the alliance .
These things can be said in the heat of battle .
These are very difficult circumstances . ""
After a meeting with Mr Karzai , Mr Browne said the British - led Helmand force has made "" enormous progress in driving back the Taliban in the north of the province "" .
He added : "" The forces ' progress has been followed by targeted development projects that are making a difference to ordinary Afghans ' lives . ""
British officers say US special forces are cavalier in their approach to the civilian population .
The tensions were illustrated by an incident the Guardian witnessed in Sangin earlier this summer .
A British patrol was abandoned by its American special forces escort in the town for several hours .
Stranded in central Sangin , British officers tried to establish radio contact with the Americans , who had disappeared without warning , and swore impatiently when they could not .
The British criticisms intensified after the Americans led them to their proposed site for a new Afghan patrol base in the town - beside a graveyard and a religious shrine .
"" Sensitivity is not their strong suit , "" said one British officer .
Most British soldiers work well with regular American troops and some speak admiringly of them .
But US special forces units are a different matter .
They operate under a different chain of command , with their own rules on everything from dress code to the use of weapons .
Whereas the British troops operate under Nato command , American special forces are commanded by the US - led coalition in Bagram airbase outside Kabul .
That means the Americans can call on a wider range of airstrikes , and also that British officers have little control over which munitions are dropped in populated areas .
The British military spokesman in Helmand , Lt Col Charlie Mayo , said the special forces had supported seven British - led operations in Helmand since last April .
He said that relations between the two sides were "" excellent "" . ""
To work together effectively we have to have bloody good cooperation and we have to mutually support each other , "" he said .
Col Mayo stressed that the British commander who had a problem with special forces had requested them to leave Sangin town only , not all of Helmand .
Officers also argue that where Taliban fighters mount ambushes from inside heavily populated areas , civilian deaths are unavoidable . ""
When you are working in a high intensity counter - insurgency environment like this , regrettably you are going to have civilian casualties , "" Col Mayo said .
In London , British officials confirmed UN forecasts that southern Afghanistan 's opium poppy crop , based in Helmand , will exceed last year 's record .

2007-08-10,"Pakistan 's president , General Pervez Musharraf , poured cold water on speculation that he was planning a state of emergency yesterday , declaring instead that he would hold free and fair elections .
The announcement capped a day of rumours and conflicting reports which gripped the country and underscored the quandary facing Gen Musharraf and his allies as they struggle to retain power .
The president first cancelled a trip to Kabul , where he was to launch a US - sponsored peace conference with President Hamid Karzai yesterday .
Then his political lieutenants stoked speculation of emergency rule .
The deputy information minister , Tariq Azim , said the harsh move might be necessary to counter a range of "" internal and external threats "" ranging from Islamists to hawkish statements by the US presidential hopeful Barack Obama . ""
All options are under consideration , "" he said .
The news sent a shudder across the country and abroad .
The Karachi stock market tumbled .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , called Gen Musharraf at 2 am local time yesterday for a 17-minute conversation .
By lunchtime , international news channels were reporting on the speculation .
Then it ended as abruptly as it had started , with a cascade of denials .
"" There is no possibility of an emergency , "" Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain , the leader of Gen Musharraf 's party , PML - Q , said late yesterday .
"" In the president 's view there is no need at present to impose an emergency , "" said the information minister , Muhammad Ali Durrani .
He hinted that the speculation was fomented by Gen Musharraf 's political allies who realise that if he is ejected from power , they go too . ""
The president was under pressure from different political parties to impose an emergency , but he believes in holding free and fair election and is not in favour of any step that hinders it , "" he said .
The U - turn highlights the apparent disarray in the Musharraf camp as a tangled confrontation between the government , opposition and judiciary - which started with his botched attempt to fire the chief justice , Muhammad Iftikhar Chaudhry , in March - moves towards a climax .
Gen Musharraf is trying to cling to power but his options are narrowing .
Ideally , he wants to be re - elected president between mid - September and mid - October for a further five years .
But the plan is hostage to a defiant supreme court .
Last month , the court ruled against Gen Musharraf in his four - month vendetta against the chief justice .
The decision was a unique victory for Pakistan 's civilians and emboldened a pro - democracy movement that has swept the country .
Yesterday the court started hearing an application by Gen Musharraf 's other great enemy , former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , who wants to return from exile .
If the action succeeds , he could return immediately , greatly angering Gen Musharraf .
The case continues next week .
President George Bush is also piling on pressure for better results in the hunt for al - Qaida suspects - pressure that compounds perceptions in Pakistan that the general is little more than a US puppet .
Before going on holiday yesterday , Mr Bush said he expected Gen Musharraf to take "" swift action if there is actionable intelligence inside his country "" .
But he refused to say whether he would order unilateral strikes on al - Qaida targets without Gen Musharraf 's permission .
Gen Musharraf is seeking to salve his woes through power - sharing talks with the main opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto , who is in self - exile .
But the prospects of a deal are constrained by Ms Bhutto 's insistence that Gen Musharraf must first resign as army chief , a leap of faith the general appears unwilling to make .
He can barely rely on the fickle support of the PML - Q , the party created to burnish his democratic credentials but which now appears to be in danger of self - combusting .
Informed sources said Mr Hussain was the main supporter of a state of emergency .
Others , however , felt the idea would cause a public backlash .
Emergency rule holds some appeal for the general and his supporters : they could muzzle the press , hobble the courts and postpone elections until early 2009 .
But analysts said the decision would be disastrous for the country .
"" It would be a weapon of mass political destruction , "" said Talat Masood , a commentator and retired army general .
"" He was probably about to take a decision and then people told him he was committing the same blunder as with the chief justice .
I think he reflected and got cold feet . ""
A state of emergency would "" not really give Musharraf much leverage "" , said the Daily Times editor , Najam Sethi .
But , he added , the fact that he considered it was a sign of his weakness and isolation ."
2007-08-13,"They have bickered , traded insults and hurled bitter accusations at one another .
But yesterday President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan and his Afghan counterpart , Hamid Karzai , came together for a surprisingly warm show of unity .
General Musharraf flew into Kabul for the closing ceremony of a cross - border jirga , or peace conference , to discuss the Taliban insurgency that threatens both their countries .
After four days of talk , the language was at times more Woodstock than Waziristan . ""
This will usher in a new era of love and understanding , "" said Pakistan 's interior minister , Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao , adding that it would "" send good vibes across the country and the region "" .
Pakistani flags draped the streets and the two leaders repeatedly spoke of "" brother nations "" .
Many of the 650 delegates , who sported a fantastic array of turbans , tailored suits and headscarves , seemed to agree .
"" I came here as a pessimist but now I am very happy .
This is the beginning of a new peace process , "" said Shukria Barakzai , an outspoken female parliamentarian from Kandahar .
"" A step in the right direction , "" said Sardar Haider Khan from Quetta , a Pakistani city across the border .
The British ambassador , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , termed it an historic occasion .
"" There was a palpable sense of relief , pleasure and of history being made . "" But whether the warm and fuzzy rhetoric will translate into changes on the ground remained in doubt .
Outside the tent doors , the Taliban insurgency continued unabated .
Three American soldiers died after being hit by a roadside bomb in southern Nangarhar province while a British soldier died in an attack in Helmand .
Across the border in Pakistan , the brutalised remains of two alleged American spies were found in the tribal belt .
One had his arms , legs and head chopped off .
A note beside the torso said the man had been paid $ 200 ( £ 100 ) a month by the Americans , and ordered locals not to grant him a funeral .
The jirga had started amid considerable scepticism , hit by the absence of tribal elders from Waziristan and of Pakistan 's largest pro - Taliban religious party , the JUI - F , which boycotted the meeting .
Diplomats cautioned for low expectations and analysts wondered about the utility of a jirga when western countries had already spent millions helping Afghans elect a new parliament .
"" It 's very unclear who these people are and what they represent , "" said Joanna Nathan of the International Crisis Group .
"" In some ways it 's a dash of everything . ""
But the shadow of President George Bush , who promoted the idea at a tense Washington meeting with Mr Karzai and Gen Musharraf last September , hung heavily over the proceedings .
After Gen Musharraf caused consternation by pulling out of Thursday 's opening ceremony at the last minute , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , gave him a late night call for an apparently stern chat .
Yesterday he flew into Kabul aboard a military plane and in an aggressively conciliatory mood .
There was "" no doubt "" that the Taliban were using rear bases in Pakistan to attack Nato , US and Afghan troops , he conceded .
But Afghan accusations that his soldiers were secretly fomenting the unrest were absolutely untrue , he insisted .
"" Pakistan has no ambition whatsoever to control Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" Taliban is a name .
Talibanisation is a concept .
We are firmly against both . ...
I guarantee you that I speak from the heart . ""
The jirga passed a slew of resolutions about cooperation on drugs and terrorism , and resolved to hold a second , smaller meeting in Pakistan .
But it only has a moral authority , and what it can achieve remains unclear .
Mahmood Khan Achakzai , a Pashtun leader from Quetta , said that corruption and manipulation in both countries was the bigger problem ."
2007-08-14,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , audaciously signalled his determination to counter US global power today by meeting his Afghan counterpart , Hamid Karzai , in open defiance of Washington 's wishes .
Mr Ahmadinejad led a high - ranking Iranian delegation to Kabul in a demonstration of growing Iranian influence in Afghanistan , where the US , Britain and other western powers are engaged in a bitter struggle with the Taliban .
The visit - Mr Ahmadinejad 's first to Afghanistan - was tailor - made to provoke alarm within the Bush administration , which accuses Tehran of destabilising its efforts while claiming that the Taliban is being armed with Iranian weapons .
Iran , which is mainly Shia , denies helping the Taliban , whose puritanical Sunni ideology it has condemned .
Today 's trip came just a week after Mr Karzai , a key US ally , publicly disagreed with the US president , George Bush , about the nature of Iran 's involvement in Afghanistan .
Addressing a joint White House press conference last week , Mr Bush said : "" I would be very cautious about whether or not the Iranian influence in Afghanistan is a positive force . ""
Mr Karzai flatly contradicted him by describing Iran as "" a helper and a solution "" .
Departing from Tehran 's Mehrabad airport , Mr Ahmadinejad paved the way to further deepen the disagreement by saying today 's talks would cover arrangements for establishing Afghanistan 's security and independence .
Describing Iran and Afghanistan as "" two brother nations with common interests , cultures and histories "" , he told reporters : "" The present condition of the region demands more exchange and negotiations between Tehran and Kabul .
In this trip economic cooperation , especially over Iran 's participation in Afghan development plans , will be discussed .
"" The trip is intended to put the seal on a range of Iranian - led reconstruction projects as well as consolidate areas of cooperation such as combating drug traffickers .
Iranian aid - worth a total of £ 125 m - has been provided for three projects , a water research centre , a dental college and equipment for Kabul 's medical university .
Illustrative of the trip 's importance from Iran 's perspective was the presence of several senior government figures in the president 's party , including Ali Larijani , secretary of the supreme national security council , Manouchehr Mottaki , the foreign minister , and the economy minister , Davoud Danesh - Jafari .
Iran gave Washington informal help in overthrowing the Taliban government following the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 .
Months later , Mr Bush killed any prospect of a thaw in relations between Washington and Tehran by labelling Iran as a member of the "" axis of evil "" , along with Iraq and North Korea .
Despite US suspicions , Iran - which has one of the world 's highest drug addiction rates - argues that it has legitimate interests in combating the influx of heroin and opiates from the poppy fields of Afghanistan .
More than 3,000 Iranian police and security personnel have been killed in clashes with drug smugglers along the Afghan border since 1979 .
There are also at least 2 million Afghan refugees in Iran .
The issue has caused tensions recently after Tehran forcibly sent around 100,000 refugees back to Afghanistan , arguing that they were illegal migrants and a drain on the Iranian economy .
Today 's trip comes just days after another key US protege , the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , visited Tehran .
The US accuses Iran of aiding Shia and other insurgents in Iran , a charge Tehran denies .
Senior Iranian officials used Mr al - Maliki 's visit to reiterate calls for a withdrawal of American forces from Iraq .
After departing from Kabul , Mr Ahmadinejad was due to fly to Turkmenistan before going on to Kyrgyzstan to attend a summit meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , a body created by Russia and China to address regional security threats , foster economic integration and counter US influence in central Asia .
Iran has observer status with the organisation but is trying to form closer links .
Mr Ahmadinejad is expected to meet the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , and Hu Jintao , the president of China , at the meeting ."

2007-08-24,"US forces have repeatedly been criticised for friendly fire incidents and for killing innocent civilians in Afghanistan and elsewhere .
The mistakes - scores of civilians have been killed this year , according to human rights groups - have threatened Afghan support for allied operations and infuriated the country 's president , Hamid Karzai .
US offensive tactics have also caused tensions with British commanders in the area .
An incident in June in Nangarhar , bordering Pakistan , illustrated how friendly fire mistakes can happen and that a breakdown in communication is usually to blame .
Local police , unaware of a nearby US patrol , opened fire on American forces , who returned fire and called in an air attack , killing seven Afghans .
Friendly fire incidents are not new .
According to Geoffrey Regan , the British author of Backfire , which chronicles the history of friendly fire , it was first recorded as long ago as the Peloponnesian war in the fourth century BC .
Estimates of friendly fire losses are hard to assess .
In both world wars countless incidents were recorded of soldiers firing on their comrades or other allies in the confusion of battle .
One study surmises that around 75,000 French troops in the second world war were killed or seriously injured in this way .
Just over 15 % of all US deaths in the war were thought to have come about through friendly fire , with a similar figure for Vietnam .
Since the first Gulf war in 1991 , deaths through what the US and British militaries now call "" blue on blue "" incidents have been far more widely reported .
In the Gulf war , nine out of the 47 British combat deaths were due to friendly fire , with the corresponding figure for US forces being 35 out of 148 deaths .
The proportion for UK troops in the current Iraq conflict is lower , although the true story of their deaths is sometimes not known until an inquest is held .
The most high - profile friendly fire incident of recent years was the killing of Lance Corporal Matty Hull by a US A10 air attack in the first days of the 2003 Iraq invasion .
Hull was among a convoy of British troops in southern Iraq which was mistaken for enemy troops , despite displaying orange signals to identify themselves .
A video of the incident as seen from the cockpit of one of the attacking aircraft was obtained by the Sun newspaper .
The coroner at the inquest , which took place earlier this year , found that the killing amounted to "" a criminal act "" that was tantamount to manslaughter .
Five days before Hull died , the pilot and navigator of a British Tornado GR4 were killed when their plane was shot down close to the Kuwaiti border by an American Patriot missile .
The next day , a British tank commander , Sergeant Steve Roberts , was shot dead by a colleague trying to protect him as he struggled with an Iraqi protester near Basra .
A day later , two crew members in a British Challenger 2 died near Basra when they were mistakenly fired on by comrades in another tank .
Then , five days afterwards , the Royal Marine commando Christopher Maddison was killed when his river launch was hit by gunfire south of Basra .
At an inquest in November last year , the coroner criticised communication failures that led to him being shot at by Royal Engineers who thought his boat was an enemy craft .
In May this year a Commons report found that British troops did not have viable combat identification kits to help them avoid the risk of friendly fire .
The latest killings come despite attempts by Nato forces in Afghanistan to reduce the risk of friendly fire and civilian casualties ."
2007-10-15,"The British government has thrown its backing behind an ambitious Afghan strategy to split the Taliban by securing the defection of senior members of the militant group and large numbers of their followers .
The strategy , spearheaded by the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , reflects a significant shift in British policy , and is showing initial signs of success .
The Guardian has learned that members of the Taliban 's leadership council have used go - betweens to negotiate their defection .
"" There is a remarkable amount of contacts between senior and serious [ Afghan ] government figures with people who are in the Taliban movement , "" said a senior British official .
"" It is conceivable you could have chunks of the Taliban breaking off and giving up violence .
Some have already done so . ""
Tribal elders , former Taliban ministers and UN officials have opened multiple back - channels between the two sides .
As British troops are being withdrawn from Iraq , the military presence in southern Afghanistan is to be bolstered in the next few months by the deployment of the Parachute Regiment and new Eurofighter / Typhoon fighter - bombers .
At the same time , however , British officials have concluded that the Taliban is too deep - rooted to be eradicated by military means .
Following a wide - ranging policy review accompanying Gordon Brown 's arrival in Downing Street , a decision was taken to put a much greater focus on courting "" moderate "" Taliban leaders as well as "" tier two "" footsoldiers , who fight more for money and out of a sense of tribal obligation than for the Taliban 's ideology .
Such a shift has put Britain and the Karzai government at odds with hawks in Washington , who are wary of Whitehall 's enthusiasm for talks with what they see as a monolithic terrorist group .
But a British official said : "" Some Americans are coming around to our way of seeing this . ""
A senior diplomatic source in Kabul confirmed the contact , but stressed it was one of multiple strands .
"" This is not shaping up to be a single dialogue with a core Taliban entity , "" he said .
The source said many of the contacts were initiated by Taliban commanders themselves , dispirited by losses at the hands of Nato bombing campaign and worried about the loss of the sanctuary in neighbouring Pakistan .
Fighting raged in North Waziristan last week as Pakistani F16 warplanes bombed suspected Taliban and al - Qaida positions . ""
Effectively what some of the commanders are offering is to capitulate , "" he said .
"" They are worried for their own skins and the skins of their families . ""
The official refused to quantify the contacts , only saying they were "" numerous "" .
The Taliban leadership , which is under the influence of foreign al - Qaida fighters , is thought to be vehemently opposed to talks .
In a message released on Friday the group 's leader , Mullah Muhammad Omar , rebuffed an offer of talks from Mr Karzai .
Some worry the talks are a Taliban stalling tactic at a time of intense military pressure .
"" Everyone on the ground thinks they 've had a real effect this year
and they want to keep the pressure up through the winter , "" said a Nato official .
"" It 's in the Taliban 's interests to appear more conciliatory when they 're under pressure . ""
The strategy is deeply controversial in Kabul , where memories of brutal Taliban rule in the 1990s are still fresh .
"" It is a complete misunderstanding of the local situation to believe that negotiating with violent extremists will result in peace , "" said Joanna Nathan of the International Crisis Group .
"" This will simply add more fuel to the conflict , not quell it . """
2007-10-25,"Afghanistan must not be allowed to become a failed state again , Gordon Brown said today , as Nato officials discussed their future commitments in the fight against the Taliban .
The prime minister acknowledged , however , that Nato must better coordinate its development effort in Afghanistan , which he described as an "" important bulwark against terrorism "" .
Mr Brown was speaking at a joint news conference with Hamid Karzai , the president of Afghanistan , at Downing Street .
Mr Karzai urged the international community to stick with his country amid signs of war - weariness from some of his Nato allies .
"" Is it time to leave Afghanistan ?
No , "" said Mr Karzai .
"" Is it time to add more responsibility to the Afghan people ?
Yes . ""
Mr Karzai said that international intervention in the country , led by the US and Britain , "" has got us magnificent results , "" but much remained to be done .
Mr Brown stressed the importance of economic development to the future of Afghanistan .
"" We know that the long - term solutions are not simply defence and security .
We are determined to work with the Afghan government to make sure the people have a stake in the future of Afghanistan , "" he said .
Mr Brown added : "" We know from the Nato commander that there are other countries prepared to do more .
"" We know also there are means by which burden - sharing can happen , but the military effort must be complemented by the diplomatic effort and the development work that 's being done .
"" Earlier , the chief of defence staff , Air Chief Marshall Sir Jock Stirrup , said that bringing Afghanistan into "" its rightful place "" in the 21st century would take the international community decades .
He also stressed the need for a political solution in Afghanistan .
"" There is a common misperception that the issues in Afghanistan , and indeed elsewhere around the world , can be dealt with by military means , "" Sir Jock told Sky News .
"" That 's a false perception .
The military is a key , an essential element in dealing with those problems , but by and large these problems can only be resolved politically . ""
In a shift of policy , Britain has reportedly thrown its support behind an Afghan strategy to split the Taliban by securing the defection of senior members of the militant group and large numbers of their followers .
Many Taliban commanders have initiated contact with the Afghan government themselves , dispirited by losses at the hands of Nato bombing and worried about the loss of the sanctuary in neighbouring Pakistan .
Mr Karzai today emphasised that the Taliban were not a monolithic force and said reconciliation was possible with those "" elements of Afghan society "" who are not part of al - Qaida or of terrorist networks .
Meanwhile , Nato has reported progress in efforts to persuade countries to contribute more troops for Afghanistan , but the US , which has been pressing for Europe to do more , said significant gaps remained .
"" I would n't say I 'm satisfied , "" said the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , at a Nato meeting in the Dutch town of Noordwijk .
"" But I would say that today was considerably more positive than I anticipated . ""
Diplomats said that nine of the 26 Nato countries made new troop offers when the meeting opened yesterday .
But officials said it was too early to estimate the overall additional contribution to Nato 's force of 41,000 .
It was unclear whether the extra contributions would be enough for the Netherlands to extend the mission of its 1,600 troops .
The Dutch government has warned it may not extend its mandate beyond August , unless its allies do more .
But Nato 's secretary general , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , said the offers were significant because they would include new deployments to the most dangerous southern battlefields and more training teams to build up Afghanistan 's fledgling army ."
2007-10-25,"Gordon Brown yesterday amplified Nato calls for more combat troops in Afghanistan to spread a burden currently being borne by UK , US and Canadian forces , but the chief of defence staff warned that the country 's problems could only be resolved by political , not military , means .
Echoing concerns expressed by General Dan McNeill , commander of the Nato - led international force in the country , the prime minister called for greater "" burden - sharing "" in Afghanistan .
Speaking after talks in London with President Hamid Karzai , he added : "" We are all determined that Afghanistan should never become a failed state again , and to support the democracy that 's been created in that country . ""
He went on to say that the long - term solutions were "" not simply defence and security "" , a point increasingly being made by frustrated British military chiefs .
"" There is a common misperception that the issues in Afghanistan can be dealt with by military means "" , said Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , chief of the defence staff , yesterday .
"" That 's a false perception ... by and large these problems can only be resolved politically . ""
He warned in an interview with Sky News that bringing Afghanistan into the 21st century would engage the international community for decades , and reflected a growing emphasis on reconciliation by saying there was a need to talk to people who "" may well have been Taliban in the past "" .
Britain has some 7,700 troops in southern Afghanistan and its military commanders say they are making progress against the Taliban .
However , they warn of the dangers of losing ground unless civil aid and development agencies come in to provide sustainable progress ."
2007-11-05,"Almost 90,000 Afghan children who would have died before their fifth birthday during Taliban rule will stay alive this year because of improved healthcare , President Hamid Karzai said yesterday .
The under - five child mortality rate in Afghanistan has declined from an estimated 257 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2001 to about 191 per 1,000 in 2006 , the ministry of public health said , relying on a new study by Johns Hopkins University .
Mr Karzai , surrounded by children at a news conference in Kabul , thanked aid organisations and Afghan health workers for their work in raising health standards .
But Afghanistan continues to face severe problems .
The health minister , Mohammad Amin Fatimi , said 250,000 under - fives died every year , mostly from malnutrition , diarrhoea , TB and malaria .
Child immunisations have risen dramatically in recent years , and newly trained volunteer health workers are helping treat pneumonia among villagers in remote areas , said Tariq Ihsan , a deputy director with Save the Children .
But he said the youngest children made up the bulk of the high child mortality rate . ""
Many newborns are dying because they do n't have access to immediate healthcare , "" he said .
Afghanistan 's child mortality rate up to age five has been among the worst in the world .
Only Sierra Leone , with 283 child deaths per 1,000 live births , Angola ( 260 ) and Niger ( 259 ) ranked below Afghanistan at 257 , Unicef said in a 2006 report ."
2007-11-07,"Warnings have been coming for months , publicly from independent commentators , privately by concerned officials and military commanders : the insurgent and terrorist threat is growing and spreading north to what has been , until now , the relatively stable and calm part of Afghanistan .
But the huge death toll from yesterday 's suicide attack in the northern town of Baghlan is a devastating blow to President Hamid Karzai 's government and to the Nato - led forces his security relies on .
It marked a departure , Amyas Godfrey , military analyst at the Royal United Services Institute ( RUSI ) , said yesterday .
"" The stepping up of tactics in an unexpected area shows a level of insurgency and organised terror we have n't seen in Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" The Taliban realised that by fighting in the south they are just not winning in terms of tactics . ""
Military commanders , including the British who have nearly 8,000 troops in the region , have expressed surprise at the way the Taliban have been attacking their fixed positions for so long in gunfights reminiscent of former wars .
British , American , and Canadian , troops have fought back , and won , though often costing lives and risking serious injury , because of superior training and weaponry .
But these , too , look increasingly like short - term successes as the Taliban and their supporters - al - Qaida - inspired Uzbeks , Chechens , Arabs or Pakistanis - change their tactics , making roadside bombs or recruiting suicide bombers .
The limited mandates of the Nato - led international security assistance force , Isaf , and of the separate US - dominated force going after al - Qaida hideouts in the mountains bordering Pakistan , has led to a lack of coherence which meant they were sabotaged right from the start by "" deficiencies at the strategic level "" .
This is the view expressed in a trenchant briefing paper recently by the thinktank , Chatham House . ""
The initial military success against al - Qaida and the Taliban could not be consolidated , "" it said .
"" The existing threat could not be eliminated : al - Qaida and the Taliban were driven to the southern and eastern border provinces where they reassembled in loose networks of smaller groups . ""
"" A security vacuum emerged in areas in which [ US anti - al - Qaida forces ] had operated against enemy forces since the newly established Afghan military and police forces were slow to build up and remained too weak to secure gained territory while Isaf was not equipped to fill this security vacuum . ""
"" Vast swaths of the country are undermanned , "" said Mr Godfrey , referring to the "" light footprint "" of the Nato - led forces .
It is against this background of increasing fragility that yesterday 's attack took place .
It was , said Mr Godfrey , a classic al - Qaida operation of the kind witnessed so many times in Iraq .
It was well - prepared against a target - Afghan MPs - which would ensure it would have a big impact , and further destabilise Mr Karzai 's weak government , as incoherent , in the view of independent observers , as the Nato - led international force .
The attack , they say , could be a wake - up call for Nato .
It may more likely encourage a growing body of opinion - including British officials and military commanders - to step up their efforts to try to persuade Taliban fighters to give up their arms and pursue more rigorously a policy of reconciliation .
For Nato commanders , it is a vicious circle .
They say there is no military solution to what Karzai and the west are trying to do in Afghanistan .
Yet they also recognise that civil reconstruction and development work can not advance without the kind of security that only the military can provide .
Lack of troops means the military is not providing it .
Western governments are as exasperated with the Karzai administration as they are concerned with the situation in Pakistan .
One senior Nato military figure said he was inclined to the "" glass being half full approach "" .
Even so , he said that any progress in Afghanistan would be slow and incremental .
It was the time , he said , for "" strategic patience "" ."
2007-11-07,"Yesterday 's suicide bomb in northern Afghanistan , the country 's deadliest attack since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 , is a huge blow to Nato , as well as President Hamid Karzai 's rickety government .
The credibility of Nato , established to deter the mass battalions of the Soviet Union and its satellites at the start of the cold war , is in danger of crumbling in the deserts and mountains of Afghanistan .
In its first ground combat mission since the US - dominated alliance was set up in 1949 , its members have not deployed enough troops and equipment to defeat an enemy driving around in pick - up trucks , armed with rockets and small arms .
Motivated as much by western temerity as Islamist ideology , Taliban leaders are now importing al - Qaida - inspired foreign fighters and terrorist tactics , notably suicide bombers , that have killed so many in Iraq .
There are some 50,000 European and North American troops in Afghanistan , most of them American but including 7,700 British backed up mainly by Canadian and Dutch soldiers .
France has committed no troops for combat .
Nor has Germany , whose soldiers are in the hitherto more stable and peaceful north .
Timo Noetzel , visiting fellow at Chatham House , describes his country 's attitude in the latest issue of the thinktank 's magazine the World Today .
"" The political debate , "" he writes , "" focuses on two issues : the potential German involvement in combat , and criticism of the American conduct of operations .
The complaint is that actions of the US forces are fuelling the insurgency , with collateral damage and mounting civilian casualties eroding community support . ""
Afghanistan , according to Gordon Brown , is the front line in the fight against international terrorism .
Des Browne , the defence secretary , describes the fight against the Taliban as a "" noble cause "" .
Yet six years after US bombs drove the Taliban out , all the evidence is that , with support from across the border in Pakistan , it is regrouping and the insurgency is intensifying .
Insurgent and terrorist attacks are 20 % higher this year than in the whole of 2006 , according to the UN .
There were more than 100 suicide attacks in the first eight months of this year compared to 123 last year and just 17 in 2005 .
More and more of the country is classified as being too risky for UN agencies and NGOs such as Oxfam to operate in .
Deprived of reinforcements on the ground , army commanders call for help from the air .
Aerial bombing leads inevitably to more civilian casualties and provokes more hostility .
While shiny new helicopters stand idly in the hangars of Europe , Nato soldiers in Afghanistan are having to hire civilian machines from Russia and Ukraine to carry supplies .
The International Institute for Strategic Studies says that "" a vicious cycle of drug - trafficking proceeds [ are ] sustaining the insurgency and ' shadow governments ' in Kandahar and Helmand provinces "" .
Corruption and tribal loyalties are sabotaging ambitious plans to build up an Afghan army and police force .
Brigadier John Lorimer , who returned last month after commanding British forces in southern Afghanistan , said his troops had made a "" huge difference "" there .
The question is , for how long ?
And it is certainly not thanks to Nato .
The following day , Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , addressed the Conference of European Armies in Heidelberg .
"" If an alliance of the world 's greatest democracies can not summon the will to get the job done in a mission that we agree is morally just and vital to our security , "" he warned , "" then our citizens may begin to question both the worth of the mission and the utility of the 60-year - old transatlantic security project itself . ""
They already are . ·

2007-12-10,"The fight for the Taliban stronghold of Musa Qala was hailed by Gordon Brown today , as an example of British troops working to support Afghan forces who were "" more and more in the lead "" in protecting their country , as he continued a surprise two - day visit to Afghanistan and Iraq .
The prime minister also pledged Britain 's continued support for Afghanistan 's security , reconstruction and development as NATO and Afghan army troops entered the town in the southern province of Helmand .
"" We are there in support of an Afghan decision that action had to be taken and we 're there in support of Afghan forces who are showing they 're in the lead in taking action at a local level , "" Brown said , speaking alongside Afghan president Hamid Karzai at a joint press conference in Kabul .
He said he expected the mission to be successful within the next few days and that it would bring "" lasting results "" .
Yesterday , Brown announced the end of British military control in Iraq within two weeks , with local forces taking over in Basra province .
He spoke in Kabul after a morale - boosting visit to Camp Bastion , around 60 miles from the fighting , where he told troops fresh from the battle that victory at Musa Qala was crucial to the future of Afghanistan .
"" I know this week in Musa Qala some of you here , and many of you not here , have been doing a very important job in clearing the Taliban from that area and the work you are doing today and over the next few days is important to the whole mission in Afghanistan , "" Brown said .
"" If we can succeed there , as we will , we can move forward events in Afghanistan in favour of a more peaceful future for the country . ""
He paid tribute to soldiers killed or injured in action including two recent casualties , Trooper Jack Sadler , from Exeter , and Sergeant Lee Johnson , from Stockton - on - Tees , saying , "" This is one of the most challenging environments , one of the most difficult of tasks , the most testing of times and the most important of missions . ""
Musa Qala had been handed over to Afghan control at the request of local leaders earlier this year but was later reclaimed by the Taliban . ""
This is a very important mission and we will continue to give it support , "" Brown said in Kabul .
He praised Karzai 's government for its fight against terrorist enemies "" who threaten not only your country but who are dangerous for the whole world . ""
"" We are determined to give more support in times to come , "" said Brown , adding that he would make a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday about future British commitments to the country .
He also said he would continue to talk with Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf about "" regional co - operation at the highest possible level . ""
Musharraf has been the subject of sharp international criticism , including from Britain , in the past month after he declared a state of emergency in his country and suspended its constitution .
Brown was visiting troops at Basra air station in Iraq yesterday , when he told them that British military control in Iraq would end within two weeks .
The prime minister heralded the decision to move to an oversight role as a sign that the southeast is moving into a new phase of reconstruction .
It means the UK is on course to halve troop numbers by spring .
Speaking to troops at the air base , Brown said : "" I have just talked to prime minister [ Nouri al- ] Maliki .
It is because of all the operations over the last few years , particularly in recent times , that the security situation has not only improved , but that he could tell me he is now recommending we move to provincial Iraqi control within two weeks , so the Iraqis can take far more responsibility for security . ""
The Guardian understands the handover could come as early as Sunday .
Despite Brown 's upbeat assessment , telling the forces that they had helped to build "" peace and prosperity "" , others believe there is a long way to go before economic and social regeneration can take place .
The Commons defence committee said last month that , while attacks on British forces had plummeted since their withdrawal from Basra city to the remaining base at Basra air station , attacks on Iraqi civilians remained high .
It questioned the point of maintaining a garrison of 2,500 troops , as Britain plans to follow with further reductions next spring .
Questions also remain over the future control of US supply routes overseen by the British .
While discussions have begun with American counterparts , arrangements have not been agreed .
Des Browne , the defence secretary , said last year that British forces would oversee the supply lines for as long as the US needed .
The prime minister has argued that oversight would consist of two phases .
The first will focus on training Iraqi forces , serving supply routes , policing the borders with Iran and remaining ready for reintervention if necessary .
The second , from spring , will involve a "" more limited "" reintervention capacity and will emphasise training and monitoring ."
2007-12-11,"Britain will retain a substantial military presence in Afghanistan for some time , Gordon Brown said yesterday , as he met President Hamid Karzai in Kabul to discuss the country 's future .
Military sources believe that British troops are likely to be there for a decade , albeit in reduced numbers in the later stages .
"" There are around 7,800 at the moment .
There will be around that level in the foreseeable future , "" said the prime minister , who earlier met soldiers fresh from the battle at Musa Qala as he toured Camp Bastion in Helmand province .
Brown , speaking at a press conference at the presidential palace - before a statement to the Commons on the strategy for Afghanistan today - said he believed forces were poised for victory in the town , which will help move the situation in Afghanistan into a new phase .
The military hopes that victory in Operation Snakebite will help it to turn the corner in the bitter fight against the Taliban .
The UN estimates that across the country , violent incidents are up 20 - 30 % on 2006 and that by October , the conflict had claimed 4,000 to 5,000 lives , compared with 4,000 last year .
Speaking to around 200 soldiers at Camp Bastion - around 60 miles from the town - Brown said : "" This is one of the most challenging of environments , this is one of the most difficult of tasks , this is one of the most testing of times , and one of the most important of missions - because to win here and defeat the Taliban and make sure we give strength to the new democracy of Afghanistan is important in defeating terrorism all around the world . ""
He added : "" The action will be effective and it will work both in the long term effect and because we are determined to back it up with other economic and social measures that will help the people of the area . ""
The Foreign Office says that more than 80 % of people now live in districts with access to basic health services , compared with 9 % in 2002 .
It also argues that the country has a wealth of underdeveloped mineral resources that could fuel a large industrial expansion ."
2007-12-26,"British and European officials today scrambled to head off a diplomatic row with Afghanistan , saying the expulsion of two western aides for allegedly holding talks with the Taliban was the result of a "" misunderstanding "" .
President Hamid Karzai 's spokesman , Humayun Hamidzada , said the two men - named in reports as a British senior UN official , Mervyn Patterson , and an Irish senior adviser to the European Union mission , Michael Semple - were "" involved in some activities that were not their jobs "" .
A spokeswoman for the EU 's foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , whose office employs Semple , said talks were continuing regarding his situation and an outcome was expected "" in a day or so at the maximum "" .
She could not guarantee that the pair - who have been ordered to leave tomorrow - would be able to stay , but said : "" This is nothing to be alarmed about .
Our impression is that this is a misunderstanding and we expect to have everything cleared up soon . ""
An Irish source said consular staff at the country 's embassy in Iran were liaising with EU officials with regard to Semple .
Sources in Dublin said he was the deputy head of the EU mission in the Afghan capital , Kabul , and was highly regarded in diplomatic circles for his knowledge of the region .
Both Semple and Patterson are said to have years of experience in Afghanistan , speaking the local languages and understanding the country 's complex tribal structures .
They had travelled to the town of Musa Qala in the volatile southern province of Helmand on Monday , said a spokesman for the UN mission in Afghanistan , Aleem Siddique .
British , Afghan and US forces retook Musa Qala from Taliban militants earlier this month .
It had been in Taliban hands since February .
Afghan officials have said a key militant leader defected from the Taliban and threw his support behind the government shortly before the battle for the town .
"" We were in Helmand province to talk to the people on the ground , to understand from the people on the ground what their needs are , what their concerns are , and that includes people who are perhaps less than supportive of the government of Afghanistan , "" Siddique said .
"" If we are to cement peace in Helmand province , that means that we have to talk to all the people in Helmand province . ""
Rory Stewart , a former British diplomat who now runs the Turquoise Mountain charity in Afghanistan , described the expulsions as "" very disturbing "" . ""
It raises the question , of course , of what exactly the Afghan government is trying to hide , "" he told the BBC .
"" Is the reason they are expelling them that they are worried that these people might reveal that there is more support for the Taliban in the south than the Afghan government is prepared to acknowledge ? ""
The attempts to resolve the diplomatic wrangle came as the Daily Telegraph reported that MI6 agents held discussions with the Taliban on "" several occasions over the summer "" .
Two weeks ago Gordon Brown told the House of Commons : "" We will not enter into any negotiations with these people . ""
The paper reported that Afghan officials were present at the talks which "" sought peace directly with the Taliban "" , according to an intelligence source .
Alun Hicks , whose 26-year - old son , Captain David Hicks , of 1st Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment , died in an attack by militants in southern Afghanistan in August , said he "" would be surprised if they 're not trying to talk to the reasonable elements of the Taliban "" .
But the shadow defence secretary , Liam Fox , said : "" We can not negotiate with people who are killing our troops . ""
A Foreign Office spokeswoman would not comment on the Telegraph report , saying it was an intelligence matter .
The Afghan government , and particularly Karzai , have voiced their interest in meeting with Taliban leaders to try to persuade them to renounce violence and enter politics .
Splitting the extremist organisation is seen as one way of helping to bring the bloody insurgency to an end ."
2007-12-28,"The two senior western diplomats expelled from Afghanistan after being accused of talking directly to the Taliban left Kabul early yesterday amid hopes that they could soon be readmitted .
Michael Semple , the Irish acting head of the EU 's mission , and Mervyn Patterson , a Briton working for the UN , flew to neighbouring Pakistan hours before the politics of the region were thrown into turmoil by the assassination of Benazir Bhutto .
The pair had been ejected on the orders of President Hamid Karzai after he accused them of holding what Kabul regards as illegal talks with unidentified Taliban last week .
They are alleged to have done so after Nato 's recapture of Musa Qala , the most important rebel stronghold in Helmand province , where British troops have engaged in heavy fighting .
Western sources said the two officials - both experienced in the region - had informed the minister for security in Kabul of what they were up to , but were victims of internal struggles within the embattled Kabul administration . ""
Karzai has been showing weakness here and acted out of feelings of pique , as he sometimes does , "" said one western source .
"" This is a struggle with the governor of Helmand
[ Asadullah Wafa ] , who had demanded the two men 's removal .
Karzai is asserting Afghan sovereignty .
"" The source echoed hopes that , once face has been saved , the well - regarded pair would quietly be allowed back .
The UN 's Kabul spokesman , Aleem Siddique , confirmed that the men had left , amid reports that Sir Sherard Cowper - Cowles , Britain 's ambassador to Kabul , was cutting short his holiday at home and returning to his post .
Britain backs the UN - EU policy of seeking to engage with lower - level Taliban as well as with middle - ranking officials and fighters who may be prepared to defect to the government side - not the same as negotiating with hardline leaders , Gordon Brown has insisted .
"" As part of our efforts in Helmand province we need to be speaking to people on the ground , "" Siddique said .
"" Tribal communities and tribal relationships are a very complex web . ""
He has insisted that the expelled officials did not meet Taliban leaders as such .
Karzai has been making offers of reconciliation of his own towards Taliban leaders and may have resented what he thought was activity behind his back that undermined his authority .
Reports that MI6 has been active in the area have raised the temperature in a zone which has been the prey of great power rivalry since the "" great game "" a century ago .
But the Bush administration and US forces in Afghanistan have been irritated by the need to retake Musa Qala after a British - negotiated withdrawal allowed the Taliban to make it a centre for drug smuggling and attacks ."
2008-01-23,"Carl Bildt , the Swedish foreign minister , seems a likeable chap .
He was n't making a fuss when I spotted him being pushed aside as he joined a sprawling queue of Davos delegates waiting to watch Wednesday evening 's political variety show .
We got Hamid Karzai first , the world 's best - dressed political leader , sporting a soft , silky grey cap that beautifully offset his trim beard .
The Afghan president did not speak for long , and what he had to say was sharp : the war on terrorism exists , has not been won and is being neglected .
That might be true .
It is certainly the sort of thing that Tony Blair ( who turned up too ) likes to hear .
He is everywhere at Davos this year , accompanying ( at a tasteful distance ) his new boss at JP Morgan , Jamie Dimon .
Blair is a lobbyist these days and does n't get top billing .
I saw him making a dash for the main stage from his less glamorous seat in the crowd , only to be sent back to wait his turn .
US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice , not Blair , was the draw .
She said she wanted to talk about idealism and optimism . ""
Perhaps there is concern you are going to hear a long moralising lecture , "" she said - before warning of a world in which nations turned inward , encouraged to do so by a global economy that seems to be stalling .
It was neocon lite , nicely expressed : a defence of the rule of law , free trade , freedom and human rights .
But the churlish might question how the "" American realism "" she is so proud of can exist alongside Guantánamo Bay . ""
The basics are universal , and we know them , "" she said .
"" Violent forces of reaction can not be allowed to triumph . ""
Freedom , she argued , comes from economic growth - and she questioned how long states practicing "" authoritarian capitalism "" can survive .
That was a dig at China and Russia .
America , she said , "" has no permanent enemies "" .
By declaring her country only seeks friends , Condi neatly turned the argument against the many states with which it is in disagreement .
She blamed Russia for "" unwise and irresponsible rhetoric that harkens back to an earlier age "" and Iran for sustaining a government the US dislikes .
But as she leaves office next year , she should perhaps also ask herself why America is involved in so many squabbles with so many states .
Expressing ideals is one thing .
Enforcing them on others quite another .
Condi - and Tony , who looked star struck - had nothing to say about the morality of that .
It took Henry Kissinger , in his astonishing growly voice , to suggest that there might be a difference between idealists and statesmen . ""
Today 's headlines are rarely the same as tomorrow 's history , "" Rice concluded .
It was plea for sympathy - a small admission , if not of failure , then at least a failure to persuade .
Blair , sitting next to her , must hope her words turn out to be true .

2008-01-25,"Downing Street today rejected claims by the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , that British forces in his country were bungling the military operation to defeat the Taliban .
The row over Britain 's efforts to quell the insurgency by Islamist militants in the restless southern Helmand province broke as Karzai was due to hold talks today with prime minister Gordon Brown at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
Karzai spoke out at a briefing with journalists at the summit .
He said : "" The American and the British forces guaranteed to me they knew what they were doing and I made the mistake of listening to them .
And when they came in , the Taliban came . ""
Karzai said the British and Americans had not deployed enough troops in Helmand to fill the power vacuum created when , on their advice , the sitting governor of the province was removed and the regional police force was disbanded .
"" We removed the police force .
That was not good .
The security forces were not in sufficient numbers ...
That was why the Taliban came back in , "" Karzai said .
"" It took us a year and a half to take back Musa Qala .
This was not a failure but a mistake . ""
The prime minister 's spokesman today rejected claims that the British troops ' presence had allowed the Taliban to return to the province .
He said : "" Of course we would n't accept that .
We are working alongside the Afghan government in order to drive out the Taliban from Helmand .
"" Our strength in Afghanistan has been to work with the Afghan government and to extend the authority of the Afghan government throughout the province to allow economic and political development . ""
And it 's to that aim that our armed forces have suffered losses and shown great bravery and determination . ""
But I would stress we are working closely with the Afghan government in relation to political and economic and military issues in Helmand . ""
The spokesman said today 's meeting of the two leaders , which was arranged before Karzai made his remarks , was expected to be brief and pointed out that they had long talks during Brown 's visit to Kabul last month ."
2008-01-26,"Downing Street yesterday rejected claims by the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , that he had been wrong to allow the British to take over Helmand province because it let the Taliban return .
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Karzai delivered a sustained attack on UK - US policy in the country which embarrassed the British government when it was reported yesterday .
"" When our governor was there , we were fully in charge , "" he said .
"" They came and said ' your governor is no good ' .
I said ' all right , do we have a replacement for this governor ; do you have enough forces ? ""
Karzai said .
"" Both the American and the British forces guaranteed to me they knew what they were doing and I made the mistake of listening to them .
And when they came in , the Taliban came ...
we removed a local arrangement without having a replacement . ""
Karzai said the change meant "" it took us a year and a half to take back Musa Qala "" .
Gordon Brown 's spokesman said that "" of course we would n't accept "" the view that Britain had only encouraged the Taliban .
"" Our strength in Afghanistan has been to work with the Afghan government and to extend the authority of the Afghan government throughout the province to allow economic and political development .
And it 's to that aim that our armed forces have suffered losses and shown great bravery and determination . ""
The spokesman added : "" I would stress we are working closely with the Afghan government in relation to political and economic and military issues in Helmand . ""
Britain has about 7,000 members of the armed forces in Helmand province .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , said last week that America 's allies in Afghanistan could not fight insurgencies properly , though British officials said he later phoned the defence secretary , Des Browne , to assure him the remarks were not directed at UK troops ."
2008-01-28,"A mounting campaign to save the life of a young Afghan journalist , Sayed Perwiz Kambakhsh , has yet to move the country 's president , Hamid Karzai , to take action .

2008-01-28,"The UN began looking for a new candidate yesterday to represent the international community in Afghanistan after Paddy Ashdown was forced to withdraw in the face of Afghan opposition .
The former Liberal Democrat leader 's withdrawal is an embarrassment for Britain , the US and the UN , which had agreed on Ashdown 's candidacy apparently without checking his acceptability to President Hamid Karzai and his government in Kabul .
Even after Karzai had raised objections last week , British officials assessed it as a minor glitch and confidently predicted Ashdown would be confirmed as the UN 's special representative to Kabul within days .
Former Foreign Office press officers had already been asked if they were interested in serving as his spokesman .
Ashdown told the BBC : "" I would n't have dreamed of undertaking the job unless [ Karzai ] agreed that I should do so .
After I saw the UN secretary - general [ Ban Ki - Moon ] , we shook hands albeit over a telephone . ""
Now something 's happened that 's changed his view .
I think that 's far more to do with Afghan internal politics than it has with the international community . ""
According to diplomatic sources , Karzai 's objections grew as he learned more about Ashdown 's record as the international community 's high representative in Bosnia , where he had a reputation for being effective and assertive .
Karzai was concerned a forceful and high - profile personality would eclipse the authority of his own government .
Ashdown said he never wanted the kinds of powers he had in Bosnia when negotiating the mandate for the Afghan job . ""
If they 'd been offered , I would have rejected them , "" he said .
"" The government of Afghanistan is a sovereign government , it 's a proud nation , President Karzai is its president .
"" In a letter to Ban , Ashdown pointed out that he had not even sought the post , but had been persuaded by the US that he would have the required backing to do what he thought necessary to coordinate international support for the Kabul government .
Ashdown also recalled that Ban had assured him , at a meeting in Madrid this month , that he had the support of Kabul .
But in the light of reports of Afghan opposition , he had decided to pull out . ""
The task involved is difficult enough in any case , "" Ashdown wrote .
"" I just do not believe it is feasible in the face of opposition from the elected government of Afghanistan . ""
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , said in a statement : "" The UK believes he was well - suited to this important role and would have done an excellent job .
It is now imperative that the UN and the government of Afghanistan work together as quickly as possible to agree a suitable candidate to take on this key role . ""
In his withdrawal letter , Ashdown said he thought that Kabul opposed his appointment "" partially based on my nationality and Britain 's role in Afghanistan "" .
But senior Afghan officials have expressed interest in another Briton , General John McColl , who led the first international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan and was Britain 's special envoy for the counter - narcotics effort there .
He is Nato 's deputy supreme commander in Europe .
The debacle over Ashdown 's appointment came at a time of growing friction in the relationship between Kabul and Nato forces .
At the Davos economic summit last week , Karzai criticised British handling of Helmand province , which has seen fierce fighting .
Analysts fear that unless there is better coordination among the donor countries , troop contributors and Kabul , the situation in Afghanistan could worsen significantly ."
2008-01-29,"Senior Foreign Office officials believe the Afghan - born US ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , is planning to stand for the presidency of Afghanistan and played a complex role in advising the current president , Hamid Karzai , to block the appointment of Lord Ashdown as the UN envoy to the country .
Ashdown , the former Liberal Democrat leader who became the international community 's high representative in Bosnia , withdrew his application for the role on Sunday in the face of Afghan objections , leaving western policy in chaos .
America and Britain had been lining Ashdown up for a senior role since October , and believed they had the support of the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - Moon , and Karzai .
High - level British sources believe that Karzai changed his position as he faced mounting objections from Pashto - speaking warlords and after advice given to him by Khalilzad , a former US ambassador to both Iraq and Afghanistan .
Khalilzad is himself a Pashtun .
British sources suggested that contrary to the official US position , Khalilzad had been warning Karzai that Ashdown was an interventionist figure and would weaken his authority still further .
Khalilzad 's office at the UN last night denied he had any interest in standing for the Afghan presidency and rejected the suggestion he had undermined Lord Ashdown as a candidate for the UN special envoy 's job . ""
Quite the opposite - he thought it was a good idea and worked hard to get it done , "" Richard Grenell , the ambassador 's spokesman , said .
He added that Khalilzad had publicly ruled out running for president in Afghanistan , describing it as "" an old rumour that has been proved erroneous "" .
Separately , a spokesman for the UK mission to the United Nations said : "" Ashdown was a US - nominated candidate and ambassador Khalilizad was closely involved in promoting Ahdown for the role .
We do n't believe rumours to the contrary . ""
Ashdown had spoken to Karzai about the appointment and agreed his job description , which would have been to coordinate the roles of Nato , the UN and the EU .
But in the past week Karzai started to turn against the British , accusing their forces of losing their grip in the south of the country in the fight against the Taliban , and then making it clear to Gordon Brown and Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , that he would not support Ashdown 's appointment .
The state - influenced press in Kabul ran stories likening Ashdown to former British generals in the first Afghan war , and even demanding to know who would be willing to assassinate him .
Some British officials said Karzai 's decision to withstand the clear US demand for Ashdown will strengthen him with some Pashtun tribes in the short term .
No one in British circles is accusing Karzai of corruption , but with the loss of support of the former Northern Alliance , the Afghan president is increasingly dependent on drug traffickers and warlords to maintain his political base .
British sources say they have no idea at this stage how they will repair the damage caused by the Afghan president 's sudden change of heart , but without a clear alternative authority figure to Karzai , the west will have to soldier on with the current president for at least another year .
Asked by the Washington Post last week whether he planned to stand again , Karzai was enigmatic , saying : "" Well , I have things to accomplish .
Who was it who wrote - Robert Frost ?

2008-02-02,"Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , is to fly to London next week to tackle an escalating row over Nato troop reinforcements for Afghanistan , amid worries that the entire international stabilisation strategy is in danger of failing .
Rice will also be talking to Gordon Brown and David Miliband , the foreign secretary , about finding a new candidate for the proposed UN "" super - envoy "" to coordinate aid efforts after President Hamid Karzai vetoed Lord Ashdown , who had been expecting to get the job .
Canada is already threatening to pull its troops out unless other countries do more .
The US state department spokesman , Sean McCormack , told reporters in Washington yesterday .
"" I wo n't make a secret of the fact that we are encouraging all Nato allies to do everything they can in terms of contributing resources . ""
Rice will also discuss Iran and Iraq .
Nato defence ministers are to meet in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius next week to try to find 7,500 more troops to reinforce the 42,000 already in Afghanistan .
Alliance divisions burst into the open earlier yesterday with a US demand that Germany , whose forces are in the relatively stable north , send combat troops and helicopters to the volatile south .
Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , sent an "" unusually stern "" request to Berlin , the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported .
But Germany 's defence secretary , Franz Josef Jung , refused to comply .
"" I keep to the view that we should continue and fulfil our mandate in Afghanistan , "" Jung said .
"" I believe our focus should continue to be in the north . ""
German chancellor Angela Merkel made clear that the limited mandate was "" not up for discussion "" .
On Thursday Gates met similar opposition from his French counterpart , Hervé Morin , in talks in Washington .
The mood in Paris and Berlin threatens a damaging replay of the transatlantic spats in the run up to the Iraq war five years ago .
But the immediate crisis has been triggered by Canada , which has threatened to bring home its 2,500 troops from Kandahar , next to Helmand province where British forces are fighting the resurgent Taliban insurgency , unless other allies send reinforcements .
Stephen Harper , the Canadian prime minister , told Gordon Brown this week that the "" clear choice "" laid out by an internal Canadian panel was that Canada would remain in Afghanistan beyond February 2009 only if allies supplied more combat troops for Kandahar and Canada acquired new equipment .
Gates angered Nato members last month when he complained that forces were still stuck in cold war mode and ill - prepared for counter - insurgency operations .
Wrangling over the number of boots on the ground coincides with a flurry of warnings that the entire effort to stabilise Afghanistan could fail because of resurgent Taliban violence and a looming humanitarian crisis .
On Wednesday the former US Nato commander , General James Jones , suggested Afghanistan was in danger of becoming a "" failed state "" because there were "" too few military forces and insufficient economic aid "" .
Oxfam separately urged troop and aid - contributing countries to undertake "" a major change in direction "" .
Lord Malloch - Brown , the Foreign Office minister , admitted yesterday that the situation was "" very difficult "" .
The UK , US , Canada and the Netherlands were all "" re - tooling strategy to align it more realistically with the possibilities "" , he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme . ""
Which means more emphasis on not just a military victory but a political approach too in support of Karzai to win over those who 've become disaffected in recent years , to win them back .
"" There was fury in London when Karzai criticised the performance of British troops in Helmand and blocked Lord Ashdown 's appointment .
Conservative MPs are starting to question the wisdom of continuing to support the president .
Ministers are braced for another critical report from the Commons international development select committee amid concern that popular support for the war will start to wane , especially as Karzai adopts an increasingly independent view .
Eighty - seven UK service personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 , most of them in the past two years ."
2008-02-07,"The Nato alliance is facing a real test in Afghanistan and needs help from a more effective Afghan army as well as bigger troop contributions from European members of Nato , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said yesterday after meetings with Gordon Brown and David Miliband in London .
Rice said she would tell the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , that there had to be a more effective Afghan military response to the Taliban threat .
In a rare piece of good news , there were suggestions that the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , would provide an extra 1,000 troops .
British officials hope the extra troops will be stationed in areas of the bloodiest conflict in Kandahar in the south , but Nato defence chiefs will discuss the position at an informal summit starting today .
Nato is seeking to draw together a new three - year structural plan for the country .
Rice and Brown also discussed the possibility of the Norwegian diplomat Kay Eide becoming the new proposed UN envoy to Afghanistan .
Karzai had vetoed the original US - UK choice of Lord Ashdown , the former Liberal Democrat leader .
A Turkish diplomat is also being considered , but the British do not expect another Briton , Major General John McColl , to be appointed , even though he has been recommended by Karzai .
Speaking after meeting Miliband , Rice did not disguise her concern at the scale of the threat in Afghanistan .
"" I do think the alliance is facing a real test here .
Our populations need to understand this is not a peacekeeping mission "" but rather a long - term fight against extremists , she added .
"" This is a different fight from what Nato was structured to do . ""
She also warned that the Taliban insurgency 's terror tactics were creating havoc for the Afghan people .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , expressed his country 's frustration even more bluntly , saying he had yet to receive any replies from a letter he has sent to all defence ministers in Nato asking them to contribute more troops and equipment . ""
I worry a great deal about the alliance evolving into a two - tiered alliance , in which you have some allies willing to fight and die to protect people 's security , and others who are not , "" Gates said during a Senate hearing on Pentagon spending plans . ""
And I think that it puts a cloud over the future of the alliance , if this is to endure and perhaps even get worse .
There are allies that are doing their part and are doing well , "" he said .
"" The Canadians , the British , the Australians , the Dutch , the Danes are really out there on the line and fighting , but there are a number of others that are not . ""
Canada has threatened to pull out unless other allies do more of the hard work .
The Germans have belatedly offered to contribute an extra 200 combat troops to replace a Norwegian unit that leaves in the summer , but there is no promise to put these forces into the dangerous south .
Speaking in the Commons , Brown said : "" We need a proper burden - sharing - not only in terms of personnel , but also helicopters and other equipment . ""
Rice , speaking on the plane on the way to London , highlighted the lack of Afghan fighting and policing capacity .
She said : "" I think that we would like to see the Afghans becoming more capable with both their army and their police forces of holding the territory that is being cleared of both Taliban and in some cases foreign fighters like al - Qaida . ""
And frankly , I think one thing that people are taking a look at ... is whether or not the Afghan security forces - the magnitude , the numbers of Afghan security forces that were once anticipated - is going to be enough for the task .
"" The US contributes a third of Nato 's 42,000-strong International Security Assistance Force mission , making it the largest participant , on top of the 12,000 American troops operating independently .
The US plans to send an extra 3,200 marines to Afghanistan this spring , including 2,200 combat troops to help the Nato - led force in the south ."
2008-02-11,"The foreign secretary , David Miliband , today said that the relationship between the Afghan government and the international community needed to improve .
He said that he had been assured by the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , that Karzai was misquoted when he appeared to blame the British and the Americans for the return of the Taliban to Helmand province .
But Miliband said the Afghan government and its allies both needed to "" raise [ their ] game "" to deal with the challenges facing the country .
If the international community pulled out , Afghanistan would become a "" failed state "" , Miliband said in an interview on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
Last month Karzai gave an interview in which he said he made a "" mistake "" when he removed the governor of Helmand following advice from the Americans and British . ""
The security forces were not in sufficient numbers .
That was why the Taliban came back , "" Karzai reportedly said .
Miliband said today that Karzai had assured him he had been misquoted . ""
He [ Karzai ] has huge respect and admiration for the work that British troops are doing all around the country , "" Miliband said .
Asked if he wanted Karzai replaced , Miliband said Karzai was democratically elected "" by millions of Afghans "" and that Britain respected that .
But he said that relations needed to get better . ""
The whole international community needs a better relationship with President Karzai , "" he said .
Asked to justify Britain 's continuing commitment to Afghanistan , Miliband said that 70 % of terrorist incidents in Britain had their origins in Pakistan , where al - Qaida operates on the border with Afghanistan .
Maintaining order in that area was "" absolutely essential for our security "" , he said .
Miliband 's comments follow a warning yesterday from the US that Nato could be destroyed if European allied troops were not prepared to fight and die in Afghanistan .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , also pointed to the dangers of a western alliance divided between US forces who do the fighting and Europeans who follow later to conduct the civilian clean - up operations ."
2008-02-14,"President Hamid Karzai 's increasingly frequent criticisms of the British forces and diplomatic initiatives in Afghanistan are endangering domestic support for the British military intervention , the international development committee warns today .
The cross - party committee of MPs says it is "" especially disappointed by the tone and timing of President Karzai 's criticisms of the British military operations "" .
In the past two months Karzai has expelled two EU and UN diplomats , claiming they were involved in unsanctioned dialogue with the Taliban , criticised the British military in Helmand , disputed the appointment of a governor for Helmand and blocked the appointment of Lord Ashdown as a super - envoy .
The committee warns in a report on reconstruction that such comments "" risk undermining the support of the British people for the UK 's long - term commitment to Afghanistan "" .
At a press conference last week Karzai claimed he had been misquoted , an explanation that is now accepted by senior figures in the Foreign Office , if not actually believed .
The committee says : "" We are disappointed that sufficient international momentum could not be gained for the appointment of a high - level joint UN - Nato - EU coordinator for Afghanistan .
Criticisms by the Afghan government of the UK and the international community 's efforts seem to be becoming more frequent .
""
The report also suggests that the US and some other donor countries are not putting a sufficient proportion of their aid through the Afghan government .
It urges the government to accept that it will take time to provide alternative livelihoods for the rural poor currently dependent on opium production .
It opposes eradication in favour of better irrigation and financial support for other crops .
It says too little has been done to improve the quality of police or the judicial system ."
2008-02-29,"After six years of US - led military support and billions of pounds in aid , security in Afghanistan is "" deteriorating "" and President Hamid Karzai 's government controls less than a third of the country , America 's top intelligence official has admitted .
Mike McConnell testified in Washington that Karzai controls about 30 % of Afghanistan and the Taliban 10 % , and the remainder is under tribal control .
The Afghan government angrily denied the US director of national intelligence 's assessment yesterday , insisting it controlled "" over 360 "" of the country 's 365 districts .
"" This is far from the facts and we completely deny it , "" said the defence ministry .
But the gloomy comments echoed even more strongly worded recent reports by thinktanks , including one headed by the former Nato commander General James Jones , which concluded that "" urgent changes "" were required now to "" prevent Afghanistan becoming a failed state "" .
Although Nato forces have killed thousands of insurgents , including several commanders , an unrelenting drip of violence has eroded Karzai 's grip in the provinces , providing fuel to critics who deride him as "" the mayor of Kabul "" .
A suicide bomb at a dog fight near Kandahar last week killed more than 80 people .
Yesterday fighting erupted in neighbouring Helmand when the Taliban ambushed a police patrol .
The interior ministry said 25 militants were killed ; a Taliban spokesman said they lost one .
A day earlier , the Asian Rural Life Development Foundation aid agency said it feared that Cyd Mizell , an American employee kidnapped in Kandahar last month , had been killed in captivity .
A big injection of foreign troops has failed to bring stability .
The US has almost 50,000 soldiers in Afghanistan and - twice as many as in 2004 - while the UK has 7,700 , mostly in Helmand .
Another 2,200 US marines are due to arrive next month to combat an expected Taliban surge .
Nato commanders paint the suicide bombs and ambushes as signs of a disheartened enemy .
Yesterday , Brigadier Andrew Mackay , commander of the British contingent in southern Afghanistan , said the Taliban were "" worn down "" , running low on fighters , and being ostracised by local communities . ""
Logistically they are also challenged .
The cumulative effect of all of this is that they are having to change their modus operandi , and that is why we are seeing more asymmetric attacks and suicide bombings in places such as Kandahar , "" he said .
But analysts believe the Taliban is successfully adapting the brutal guerrilla tactics that have served Iraqi insurgents so well .
The six British soldiers killed in Helmand over the past three months were victims of roadside bombs .
The drugs trade is swelling the Taliban coffers - according to the highest estimates , 40 % of profits , or tens of millions of pounds , go to the insurgency .
Attacks have made the main road from Kandahar to Kabul too dangerous for foreigners .
Afghan truck drivers travel with armed escort .
The insecurity has penetrated the capital .
Since an assault on Kabul 's Serena Hotel last January , westerners have disappeared from the streets of Kabul .
This week Taliban commanders threatened to step up the campaign with more bombs .
The key to the Taliban 's success , McConnell said , "" is the opportunity for safe haven in Pakistan "" .
Meanwhile the surge in violence has placed a big strain on Nato .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , has agreed to deploy a battalion outside Kabul after America has criticised European states for refusing to join the fight in the south and Canada threatened to withdraw its troops from Kandahar next year if reinforcements do not arrive .
An Oxfam report yesterday said international and national security forces , as well as warlords , criminals and the Taliban , were perceived by ordinary Afghans as posing security threats ."
2008-03-20,"The US vice - president , Dick Cheney , today called on Nato allies to "" reinforce "" their commitment to Afghanistan , as he made an unannounced visit to the country .
After talks with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , Cheney said the US would ask other countries to send more troops to share the burden of fighting the Taliban . ""
Isaf [ the international security and assistance force ] has made a tremendous difference in the country and America will ask our Nato allies for an even stronger commitment for the future , "" he told reporters in Kabul , according to Reuters . ""
All free nations have an interest in a secure , democratic Afghanistan , "" he said .
The level of member states ' commitment in Afghanistan will be a key issue at a Nato summit in Romania next month .
Together with Britain , Canada and the Netherlands , the US – whose troops make up a third of the 43,000-strong Isaf force in Afghanistan – has urged other countries such as France and Germany to commit numbers to help fight the Taliban in the volatile south .
Cheney said the Afghans had shown "" unwavering "" courage in "" throwing off the burden of tyranny and winning freedom "" , and stressed Washington 's support was "" unshakeable "" .
He said Pakistan had an obligation to impose stability on the lawless border region and insisted the Pakistani government had as "" big a stake as anyone else "" in fighting al - Qaida .
Afghanistan has in the past accused Pakistan of providing a safe haven for militants along the rugged mountainous border , but cooperation between the two has improved since last year .
"" I have no reason to doubt their commitment to dealing with the problems that emerge from that area if terror groups are allowed to operate from there , in part because I think their government is a target for al - Qaida and the extremists in the north - western section of Pakistan , "" Cheney said .
Karzai said the Afghan army was getting stronger "" day by day "" but that international support would be needed for years to come .
More than 8,000 people died in fighting in Afghanistan last year , which was the most violent since the US invasion in 2001 , and there have been growing questions about the progress of the reconstruction effort ."
2008-04-02,"Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , is expected to propose a radical expansion of the Afghan army today and call for his troops to take over security responsibilities in Kabul from Nato , according to officials at the alliance 's summit in Bucharest .
The news came after dismal day for Nato leaders , with the alliance unable to agree on new members .
The summit was split on whether to offer membership prospects to Georgia or Ukraine , while Greece was able to block Macedonian membership single - handed .
Croatia and Albania were invited to join the alliance .
Karzai 's proposal is an attempt to compensate for a shortfall in international troop contributions to Afghanistan .
Under the plan , the Afghan army would assume security responsibilities in the capital before the end of the year .
It would eventually expand its strength from 55,000 to 120,000 , well above the ceiling of 86,000 agreed earlier this year with the Afghan government 's international backers .
The proposal will be discussed by Nato leaders at a meeting on Afghanistan that will hammer out a new mission statement for the 47,000-strong alliance force there .
A bigger role for the Afghan army will be portrayed as a bright spot for the summit .
The alliance is at odds over troop contributions in Afghanistan , where the US , Britain and Canada feel they are bearing a disproportionate weight .
James Appathurai , Nato 's spokesman , said the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , had offered to send a battalion - about 700 troops - to Afghanistan 's eastern front , which will release US troops to support embattled Canadian forces in the south .
But the French offer is less than expected .
Canada had threatened to withdraw its forces from the southern Afghan province of Kandahar unless other Nato members provide reinforcements and equipment .
Gordon Brown , who arrived in Bucharest yesterday evening , said : "" We believe there could be a greater burden - sharing , with countries providing equipment even where this will be used by the forces of other countries ...
This is about people coming up to the plate . ""
According to sources familiar with the draft mission statement , it will emphasise the need for a shared long - term commitment in Afghanistan .
It will also call for : · Afghan troops to take the lead wherever possible in fighting the Taliban and providing security . ·
Greater coordination between civilian and military arms of the international presence in Afghanistan .
· Pressure on Afghanistan 's neighbours to contribute more to pacification .
Pakistan is seen as its most troubling neighbour , with Taliban forces using its territory as a haven from which to mount attacks .
Greece was bitterly opposed to the accession of Macedonia , favoured by the rest of the alliance , because of the former Yugoslav republic 's name , which Athens argues implies a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of Macedonia . ""
For the moment , Greece is not in a position to agree to the entry of Macedonia and it will be Croatia and Albania first , "" Spain 's foreign minister , Miguel Ángel Moratinos told reporters late last night .
George Bush also pushed hard for an offer of membership action plans ( Maps ) - which list the requirements for joining Nato - to Ukraine and Georgia , but faced resistance led by Germany and France .
Britain backed offering Maps to the two former Soviet republics , but not at the expense of Nato unity .
A late night debate among the leaders failed to resolve the disagreement ."
2008-04-26,"Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , has called on British and American troops to stop arresting Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan , saying that their operations undermined his government 's authority and were counter - productive .
The stinging attack , made in an interview with the New York Times published yesterday , is the latest in a series of rows between Western governments with troops in Afghanistan and the elected leader of the country .
Western diplomats expressed surprise at the Afghan leader 's criticism and the Foreign Office played down the row yesterday . '
We fully support the Afghan government and continue to work with it , President Karzai and the international community in the interests of the Afghan people and the long - term peace and stability of Afghanistan , ' said a spokesman .
Karzai is facing re - election next year and may be hoping to bolster flagging support with a populist stance .
However , in recent months relations have deteriorated seriously , with Western officials openly doubting the ability of the Afghan president , who was heavily backed by the US and the UK in 2001 after the fall of the Taliban regime , to manage rampant corruption and combat drug trafficking in the war - wracked southwest Asian state .
Karzai said he wanted American forces to stop arresting suspected Taliban members and their supporters , saying that fear of arrest and their past mistreatment were discouraging them from coming forward to lay down their arms . '
It has to happen , ' he said .
' We have to make sure that when a Talib comes to Afghanistan ... he is safe from arrest by the coalition . '
Efforts at winning over Taliban fighters or sympathisers are mired in confusion : Nato allies in Afghanistan are divided over the exact nature of the amnesty or ' reconciliation programme ' for insurgents .
British policy , despite official insistence that ' there are no negotiations with the Taliban ' , is to weaken the radical Islamic movement by splitting off foot soldiers tempted by money or misled by tribal chiefs , religious leaders and ideologues from a ' hardcore ' of leaders . '
We fully support efforts to bring disaffected Afghans into society 's mainstream , providing they renounce violence and accept Afghanistan 's constitution , ' said the Foreign Office spokesman .
' We have always said there is no military solution in Afghanistan - a fully comprehensive approach is needed ... and that will involve reconciliation of those Taliban prepared to integrate into the new Afghanistan . '
However , Washington is more sceptical of such efforts , and has been fiercely critical of some British tactics aimed at winning over key Taliban commanders in the past , as has Karzai himself .
Karzai also attacked the number of civilian deaths inflicted by the coalition .
Although levels of ' collateral damage ' inflicted by Nato operations have dropped substantially , deaths still continue .
Two women and two children were killed recently in an air raid by Nato troops on a suspected Taliban position after a firefight .
Up to 9,000 civilians have died since 2001 . '
I want an end to civilian casualties , ' the Afghan president said in the interview . '
And as much as one may argue it 's difficult , I do n't accept that argument . '
Relations between Karzai and London were strained last month by the Afghan premier 's rejection of Lord Paddy Ashdown , the favoured candidate to take up a post as ' aid tsar ' in Kabul with a brief to coordinate the international aid flowing into the country .
Karzai blocked the appointment amid negative local press coverage , a historic popular distrust of the British and advisers ' fears of a potential crackdown on corruption .
With casualties and costs mounting and little obvious progress , Western governments are looking increasingly for an exit from Afghanistan , where 94 British servicemen have been killed since 2001 . '
Nato now wants a way out which is not failure , ' said Mike Williams , of London 's Royal United Services Institute . '
They need to redefine the situation which will allow them to leave without failing . '
A key problem for policymakers is ' battle fatigue ' among Western populations . '
We are going to get bored of the war long before the Taliban are , ' said one Nato official ."
2008-04-27,"Had the assassin 's bullet or rocket hit their target , the Afghan president Hamid Karzai , the attack yesterday would have been seen as a devastating blow to Nato 's efforts to stabilise the country .
Unfortunately the same proposition holds true in life as in death .
Mr Karzai , who has survived several assassination attempts , lives to fight another day , but the battle for Afghanistan is no nearer being won .
After six years of US - led military support , security on the ground continues to deteriorate .
No more vivid illustration of this is provided by yesterday 's attack on a military parade in Kabul , in which heavily armed militants got within 100 yards of a target - rich assembly of government ministers , former warlords and foreign diplomats .
Two deputies sitting in the front row , 30 yards from where Mr Karzai was standing , were hit .
Worse still , there appears to be no plan and no consensus on how to stabilise the country .
Senior British and US military sources are openly sceptical about Mr Karzai 's weak leadership , his inability or unwillingness to remove corrupt officials , or to crack down on drug trafficking .
As he faces parliamentary and presidential elections next year , there are fears that the country is sliding back into Taliban - style rules , such as the attempt to stop TV channels broadcasting popular Indian soap operas .
The feeling is mutual .
In an interview with the New York Times on Saturday , Mr Karzai criticised the British and American conduct of the war .
He said US arrests of Taliban militants and their sympathisers were discouraging his efforts to encourage them to lay down their arms .
He blamed mistreatment by some warlords and US forces for having driven the Taliban out of the country to Pakistan , where they have regrouped and rearmed .
Both the return to Islamic values and Mr Karzai 's increased assertiveness with the foreign countries who installed him in power might be seen as politically motivated .
He may be striking a more independent , nationalist posture in the run up to elections .
On the other hand , there is truth in what the generals are saying about Mr Karzai .
He is certainly right to say that civilian deaths seriously undermine efforts to fight the Taliban .
Nearly 2,000 civilians died as a result of the conflict last year including 240 in air strikes , according to the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office .
Where his claims against US and British tactics fall on stonier ground is the account he gives of his own campaign against the Taliban .
He said they should not have been forced out of the country , but the weakness of his government was such that he only learned about it "" too late "" .
This is hard to believe .
First , the Taliban have not been forced out of the country and are very much in evidence , not only in the 10 % of the country they control , but the 30 % that the government controls .
Second , corruption and kinship count for more than principle .
One of the reasons why Mr Karzai vetoed the appointment of Lord Ashdown as a super - envoy , or why he expelled two EU and UN diplomats , was not because they would have thwarted a dialogue with the Taliban .
The diplomats were engaged in one .
It was because the ensuing dialogue could not have been manipulated by him .
Outgunned in clashes in Helmand , the Taliban is adopting the tactics that suited the insurgency in Iraq so well - suicide bombings , roadside bombs , and attacks in the heart of the capital .
These are clear warning signs that the Afghan mission is at a turning point .
Mr Karzai claims he is the only man to lead the country , but General Pervez Musharraf made similar claims for his leadership of Pakistan .
And look what is happening to him : the new civilian government proves there is always an alternative .
Without a clear counter - insurgency strategy which involves talking to the Taliban , and a foreign operation which puts aid at its heart , Afghanistan could well follow Iraq 's path ."
2008-04-28,
2008-04-28,"President Hamid Karzai survived an assassination attempt yesterday when Taliban militants fired gunshots and rockets at a military parade in central Kabul .
Three people , including an MP , were killed .
Cabinet ministers , generals and foreign diplomats ducked for cover after shots rang out at the heavily guarded ceremony near the presidential palace .
Bodyguards bundled Karzai into one of a convoy of vehicles that sped away .
Live coverage on state television showed two turbaned MPs slumped in their seats , one about 30 metres from Karzai .
One died later , as did a minority leader and a 10-year - old girl .
Television coverage was cut as rockets exploded in a nearby street .
Uniformed bandsmen and some soldiers joined hundreds of others scrambling to safety .
Karzai appeared on television less than an hour later , reassuring Afghans
he was alive and appealing for calm . ""
Today , the enemies of Afghanistan , the enemies of Afghanistan 's security and progress tried to disrupt the ceremony and cause disorder and terror , "" he said .
"" Afghanistan 's military forces surrounded them quickly and arrested some of the suspects . ""
The Taliban claimed responsibility , saying the attack disproved Nato claims that the insurgency was weakening .
"" Three of our attackers have been killed and three managed to escape .
Small arms and RPGs [ rocket - propelled grenades ] were used in the attack , "" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters from an undisclosed location . ""
Afghan and Nato authorities this year repeatedly said the Taliban are on the verge of annihilation ...
Now it is has been proved to them the Taliban not only have the ability to operate in the provinces , but even in Kabul . ""
Nato condemned the attack and said it would make no difference to its involvement . ""
Nato will continue to support the Afghan government and people in defending their security and their democracy , "" the secretary general , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , said in a statement .
Among the foreign officials in the stand were the US and British ambassadors and General Dan McNeill , the commander of international forces in Afghanistan .
All escaped unhurt .
UK envoy Sherard Cowper - Coles was standing in the front row .
"" It was coming to the end of the 21-gun salute .
I saw an explosion and a puff of dust to the left of the parade and then heard the crackle of small - arms fire from all directions , "" he said .
"" My bodyguard frogmarched me away . ""
The military event occurred on the 16th anniversary of the victory of Mujahideen fighters over the Soviet - backed communist government .
The attackers fired from a three - storey building overlooking the parade ground , which is opposite Kabul 's largest mosque .
There had been tight security in the city for days beforehand .
Afghan intelligence rounded up 100 people from the surrounding area for questioning .
The assassination attempt was the third since 2001 and the first in Kabul .
Karzai has survived several such attempts since he came to power after US - led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban in late 2001 .
Taliban insurgents regrouped and relaunched their insurgency two years ago and now fight daily battles with Afghan and foreign troops , mainly in the south and east , and have mounted scores of suicide attacks throughout the country .
US - led forces killed several militants on Saturday in a raid north - east of Kabul , targeting a man involved in bomb attacks who was planning to disrupt ceremonies on Sunday .
Several civilians were wounded in the ensuing battle in which artillery and air strikes were called in , the US military said .
Karzai has repeatedly offered to hold peace talks with the Taliban , but the hardline Islamist militants have said they will fight on until they topple him and have driven out the more than 50,000 foreign troops based in Afghanistan ."
2008-04-29,"This past weekend 's assassination attempt on Afghan president Hamid Karzai , along with ongoing negotiations between the Pakistani government and elements of the Taliban , should move the focus on America 's national security debate away from Iraq .
But it is not likely to have much of an impact - in large part because of the misplaced priorities of the Bush administration .
America 's national security debate remains fixated on Iraq , a policy costing US taxpayers upwards of $ 10bn a month and diverting attention away from other national security priorities .
Yet what happens in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the next eight months will likely have a much greater effect on whether Americans are more secure than the outcomes of Iraq 's multiple factional disputes and internal struggles over power sharing .
For the past year , US intelligence agencies have been sending warning signals that what happens along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border will directly impact America 's security .
Last July , a National Intelligence Estimate , representing the collective judgment of top US intelligence agencies , concluded that the al - Qaida "" is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the Homeland "" and that the group has protected or regenerated key elements to attack the United States in a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) .
In multiple congressional testimonies earlier this year , intelligence officials amplified the core message of its intelligence estimate : closely monitor events in this region of the world in order to guard against another major terrorist attack .
Karzai 's narrow escape in the Afghan capital of Kabul this weekend should serve as a wakeup call to shift the focus to a new front .
In this assassination attempt , militants attacked a public ceremony attended by numerous Afghan and foreign dignitaries - an attack that highlighted the lack of progress in Afghanistan , more than six years after the war began .
The Bush White House acknowledged that its strategic goals are unmet in Afghanistan in its own assessment late last year , but it has not yet implemented any major policy shifts on the Afghanistan front .
Security in Afghanistan is tightly linked to events in Pakistan , where tribal areas bordering Afghanistan have become lawless zones of instability that have served as a safe haven for the Taliban and al - Qaida elements .
The February , elections swept opponents of President Pervez Musharraf into power at the national and provincial levels , and these new leaders have begun a process of complicated negotiations with tribal leaders and elements of the Taliban in an attempt to extend the Pakistani government 's authority to these lawless regions .
Critics of these moves point to the failed attempts by Musharraf to strike deals with pro - Taliban militants in 2006 - noting that the deals did nothing to make these areas more secure and ultimately contributed to the security problems that both Afghanistan and Pakistan are now currently facing .
The proponents of these negotiations argue that they are necessary for stabilising the region - and that the newly elected governing authorities have greater legitimacy and credibility than the unpopular Musharraf did , and that their approach will include measures to improve the quality of life of ordinary citizens to reduce the appeal of extremist groups in these regions .
A great deal of uncertainty lies ahead for Pakistan .
The discussions between the Pakistani government and Taliban leaders are likely to take an "" on again , off again "" quality , as today 's announcement from the Taliban Movement that it would pull out of a proposed peace deal because the Pakistani army would not withdraw from tribal lands along the Afghan border indicates .
But America can not afford to continue to divert its attention away from this complicated conflict zone .
Devoting so much of our resources and attention to Iraq has significant opportunity costs .
Perhaps this is why the Bush administration has decided to appoint General David Petraeus , the current top commander in Iraq , to become the next head of the US Central Command ( Centcom ) .
Centcom 's area of responsibility stretches from Egypt and the Horn of Africa to Pakistan and includes Iraq - and this new position will require Petraeus to juggle multiple challenges in some of the most dangerous places on the planet .
Confirmation hearings for General Petraeus later this year offer an important opportunity for Congress to raise questions about how America can strike the right balance and match its considerable yet strained resources to the numerous threats it faces in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Iraq ."
2008-05-03,"Syed Ali was playing on the roof of his mud - brick house when the killers came for Afghanistan 's President Hamid Karzai last week .
Karzai survived the attack on Kabul 's broad parade ground .
Ten - year - old Syed Ali , a kilometre away watching his mother cleaning almond shells to supplement the family 's winter fuel , died , with two others , when he was hit by a stray bullet .
Amid the furore of how a plot - apparently known of in advance - could have come so close to killing Karzai , the death of Syed Ali has all but been forgotten .
An official from the President 's office came to see the family and said he would come again .
When I met the family , they were still waiting for his return .
His mother can barely speak ; two days of crying has reduced her voice to a croak .
The boy 's uncle tells the story of yet another of the thousands of Afghanistan 's dead - as the sporadic conflict has worsened in the last two years - whose stories are never told . '
He was a clever little boy , ' said Syed Jan Agha . '
He wanted to be a doctor when he grew up . '
The family leads us to the tiny flat roof .
There are some spilled nutshells ; a little stain in the mud .
The uncle points to where the bullet flew from , near the small dome of a mosque just visible in the distance .
Another uncle , Sadiq Kaka , shows us a video taken on his mobile phone .
It shows a child with thick dark hair .
He seemed almost alive , lying on what looks like a slab .
His wound is a little tear , by his right armpit .
When he was not at school , his uncle says , Syed Ali sold matches to support his family , whose staple diet is rice and water . '
We did not even have enough money to pay for the taxi to take him to be graveyard , ' he says . '
So we had to borrow money for the funeral .
You know , after the Taliban fell , we were promised a bright future .
But those who had money benefited and the poor ...
we are still poor . '
Syed Ali 's father , Kamal , says : ' In the time of the civil war my elder son was also martyred .
This was the second son to die . '
The attack on Karzai that killed the child and a follow - up gun battle on Wednesday with suspected Taliban has terrified Kabul .
Since the suicide attack on the city 's Serena Hotel in January , in which six people died , ordinary Afghans in this city fear the violence of civil war that they know so well creeping up again .
The suggestion by Western officials that the Taliban is crumbling seems premature .
Thousands crowded on to roofs to watch the public retribution that came on Wednesday to a neighbourhood not far from Syed Ali 's home , a steep , rocky slope above the ornate and freshly reconstructed gardens of the Barbur Bagh .
The Afghan government claims that hundreds of armed police and intelligence agents descended on a hideout of Taliban members linked to those who tried to kill Karzai .
They faced rocket - propelled grenades fired from the secret tunnels by fighters who finally blew themselves up inside the house .
But the evidence at the scene and the accounts of neighbours of the group ' who came from somewhere else in Afghanistan ' belies this version .
There is a house but no tunnels , nor evidence of a suicide bombing .
Neighbours said that while those inside shot back at the police , they had no rockets .
Indeed , all that can be seen is evidence of guns fired at close quarters at several targets inside a house : at someone hiding behind a large oil drum , and sprayed up against an inside wall .
All that is clear is that a woman and a child as well as several ' militants ' were shot dead .
None of this brings back Syed Ali .
When his mother finally speaks , she has someone to blame - the men of violence who triggered the fighting : ' The people who killed my son were enemies of Afghanistan , and of the people of Afghanistan , ' she says . '
They sent a bullet for the heart of the President of Afghanistan .
But it pierced my son instead .
I pray to God to do the same to them . '"
2008-05-12,"Afghanistan 's top civilian counterterrorism official and the chief of police in Kabul are among eight security officials who have been suspended from their posts after an assassination attempt on the country 's president , Hamid Karzai , officials said today .
The attorney general 's office will question the officials , who were considered responsible for security at the time of the attack , on April 27 , said Hayatullah Hayat , a spokesman for the office .
Karzai escaped unhurt from the gunfire at a military parade in Kabul , which was also attended by foreign ambassadors .
Three people were killed in the attack .
The Taliban said it had carried out the attempt on Karzai 's life .
But officials also blamed al - Qaida - linked militants based in neighbouring Pakistan , and arrested two Afghan government employees for alleged involvement in the plot .
Hayat did not specify why the eight officials - among them Abdul Manan Farahi , the interior ministry official in charge of counterterrorism - had been suspended .
He said their fate , including whether or not they would face criminal charges , would be decided after questioning , but he did not say whether they were considered suspects .
The attack was at least the fourth attempt to kill Karzai since he came to power , six years ago .
It highlighted the US - backed president 's weak grip on the country , and Afghanistan 's tenuous security situation .
The Taliban , who were toppled from power in the US - led invasion of 2001 , are leading an insurgency that is strongest in Afghanistan 's south and east but has also struck in the capital .
At least 1,200 people have died in fighting in 2008 , according to a tally compiled by the Associated Press of figures from western and Afghan officials .
The UN says more than 8,000 people , most of them militants , died in insurgency - related violence in 2007 ."
2008-05-25,"A mountainside road near Malakand in Pakistan 's Northwest Frontier Province .
Photograph : John Moore / Getty Images Khyber Pass , Northwest Frontier Province , Pakistan - Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf and his Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai never had a shared border strategy .
But standing at Michni Post , the highest point of the Khyber Pass , staring down at the thousands of trucks and buses buzzing through Afghanistan into Pakistan under the shadows of the Hindu Kush , the answer is obvious : controlling the Afghan - Pakistan border requires a counterinsurgency policy that looks at Afghanistan and Pakistan together .
Pakistan 's new government has a great opportunity to make this change .
In order to cut off the Taliban and al - Qaida 's recruitment and supplies , both countries should fight the militants in tandem .
That means , first , improving security training for the border forces , starting with Pakistan 's Frontier Corps , the 50,000-man combat force along the 1,600-mile Afghan border .
These "" sons of the soil "" are in bad shape .
They receive no more than two dollars a day to patrol the area , which ranges from 25,000-foot - high mountains to barren deserts .
They also fight with old weapons .
As one senior commander told me , "" the Taliban are better equipped and have more fire power .
"" They have no air mobility , and worse , no rapid reaction force to support them .
Two Frontier battalions have been under siege at Ladha Fort in South Waziristan for the past few months .
Security along the border can run on parallel tracks .
Major General Muhammad Alam Khattak , the Frontier Corps ' inspector general , made a suggestion to me : "" Take our Frontier Corps .
Train them somewhere and bring them back . ""
Afghanistan should do just that .
Through Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) Afghan National Army training program , it should rotate the Frontier Corps battalions with their Pashtun brothers one at a time .
Additional resources provided by Pakistan for proper equipment and force buildup - including the creation of a Frontier Corps Rapid Reaction Force - should be committed so that Frontier Corps soldiers become the counterinsurgency partners in Pakistan that Afghanistan needs .
Second , reconciliation with the insurgents should begin by inducing defections .
This was recommended by a senior US military commander , who said that "" 60 % of insurgent activity could be curbed by reconciliation . ""
Despite overwhelming support for this process , the methods to achieve it are wanting .
In Afghanistan 's Helmand Province , 2,000 Taliban fighters were rounded up and vetted by Isaf forces , only to be abandoned after the initiative was not supported by Afghanistan 's central government .
In Khost , dozens of former Taliban members from the Tribal Areas defected , promising to lay down their arms in exchange - only to be given nothing .
In both cases , the defecting insurgents said the same thing : they could recruit dozens more , they just need incentives .
A regional reconciliation program targeting mid- and lower - tier Taliban and al - Qaida commanders should be developed and implemented by Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Third , the drug lords should be arrested and detained .
As one senior Afghan government official said , "" If you ca n't remove a corrupt judge , how can you deal with the Taliban ? ""
There are a hundred top drug lords in Afghanistan .
Everyone knows who they are .
Yet none has been arrested .
Not doing so , due to fear of backlash , only enhances their power .
And allowing them to continue to control the smuggling routes creates a ripple effect that bankrolls corruption of provincial officials and the Afghan National Police , which in turn feeds the insurgency .
Finally , reform the madrassa system .
Not all madrassas are hotbeds of terrorist training .
The problem is that Afghan religious students must go to Pakistan for any religious education after 19 or 20 years of age .
They are then quickly pressured to become "" bad Taliban "" through money , propaganda , and pressure from Pakistani mullahs .
To address this problem , Afghan education minister Hanif Atmar - perhaps the most reform - minded member of the government - is seeking to build 34 new madrassas ( his goal is 2,000 ) in Afghanistan for higher learning .
His proposal , which aims to reform the curriculum to include Islamic studies , gender studies , computer science , and English , should receive overwhelming support .
With fewer students from Afghanistan going to Pakistan , Pakistan could turn its attention to the country 's own madrassas and to the mullahs who convert students into suicide bombers .
The curriculum for both countries , based on Atmar 's proposal , should be coordinated .
Madrassas that meet these curriculum standards should be registered , supported , and encouraged .
Only an effective Afghan - Pakistani partnership can begin to control the insurgency in the border area .
The war in Afghanistan , and destabilisation in Pakistan , will not end without it .

2008-06-12,"Six weeks after he survived another assassination attempt , the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , will march into a conference hall in central Paris today with a long and rather pricey shopping list .
He is looking for $ 50bn in foreign assistance over five years to pay for schools , roads , guns and other things deemed necessary to rebuild his conflict - ridden country .
It is the latest of several donor jamborees –
he has already been to Tokyo , Berlin and London .
As ever , the mantra is to put an "" Afghan face "" on the effort .
But among the representatives of the 80 countries and international organisations gathered in Paris , there will be a gnawing sense of unease .
Despite some bright spots , reconstruction is not going well and is ridden with allegations of corruption and incompetence .
Karzai 's store of international goodwill is dangerously depleted .
Donors worry their money will be frittered away into the pockets of greedy officials .
Karzai 's government is riddled with graft , much of it hitched to the insidious drug trade .
Yet instead of introducing reforms , critics say the president is building political alliances with unsavoury characters in the run - up to presidential elections scheduled for late next year .
Karzai defended his alliances with former warlords in a recent interview with Der Spiegel .
"" We lack the power to solve these problems in other ways , "" he said .
The president also denied long - standing accusations that his brother is a major figure in the narcotics mafia . ""
Ahmed Wali has been accused of drug - dealing .
I have thoroughly investigated all these accusations and , of course , none of them is true , "" he said .
Outside politics , there is also the question of capacity .
Of the $ 25bn pledged by foreign donors since 2002 , only $ 15bn has been spent .
A dearth of qualified professionals means some government ministries have difficulty spending their budgets .
And a raging insurgency in the south and east means that government officials can not travel to some areas for fear of being shot by the Taliban .
It 's not all bad .
Post - Taliban Afghanistan has some proud achievements to boast of , including a popularly elected government , two million girls in school and improving health services available to 80 % of the population .
In opinion surveys Afghans insist they want the foreigners to stay .
Last Monday the American first lady , Laura Bush , flew in to bolster Karzai , her husband 's old ally .
"" I do n't think it 's really that fair , "" she said of the criticisms against Karzai .
Afghanistan still ranks 174th out of 178 countries on the UN Human Development Index and public disillusionment is setting in .
Many Afghans will greet the Paris conference with a cynical shrug as the latest money - wasting step in a process that benefits them little .
According to a recent study by Integrity Watch Afghanistan , a Norwegian - funded , Kabul - based watchdog , two - thirds of Afghans feel there is corruption in aid , and a large majority believe that less than 40 % of foreign funds actually reaches the people it is intended for .
Suspicions are fuelled by anger at the high salaries and relatively comfortable lifestyles of western aid workers .
Up to 20 % of international aid is spent on "" technical assistance "" - jargon for highly paid foreign consultants - according to IWA .
Some staff at the US government 's development agency USAid , for example , earn $ 22,000 a month - 367 times more than an Afghan teacher .
The solution , experts say , is to concentrate on quality rather than quantity of aid .
But that will require urgent reforms on all sides - including among donor nations .
"" Quality of spending is really crucial .
That 's where more attention should be paid , "" said Mariam Sherman , country director of the World Bank in Kabul .
Some government programmes work well , Sherman said , and corruption is a problem only if there is weak oversight .
The World Bank has spent $ 2.4bn of foreign aid without major worries , she said .
"" The assumption that somehow the money is getting stolen is not what we are finding . ""
The problem , the World Bank says , is that two - thirds of aid is channelled outside the government .
This has resulted in a "" second civil service "" , staffed by overpaid and loosely supervised consultants who are despatched to government ministries by their own governments - the notorious "" technical assistance "" .
Outside the cities , foreign aid is subject to "" cascading contracts "" - aid projects that are sub - contracted from one private company to another several times until the amount spent is a fraction of the original donation .
In Paris , few expect Karzai to get the requested $ 50bn but he will almost certainly return home with a batch of handsome promises .
The question is how to translate them into progress on the ground - and fast .
The high number of western military casualties - Britain lost its 100th soldier this week - is sapping patience with Afghanistan in western capitals .
But the stakes are higher than ever .
A retreat by western forces could trigger a civil war and create a haven for Islamist militancy .
As the International Crisis Group warned in a recent report , "" the risk of losing Afghanistan is very real "" ."
2008-06-12,"The US , Britain and other donor countries yesterday pledged more than $ 20bn ( £ 10.3bn ) in aid for Afghanistan over the next five years in an attempt to shore up Hamid Karzai 's embattled government .
The total , pledged at a donor conference in Paris , fell short of the $ 50bn Karzai was formally seeking for his national development strategy
but it was more than Afghan officials had privately expected .
Bernard Kouchner , France 's foreign minister , said the amount was "" beyond his dreams "" .
Donors made clear that the Afghan government had to do more to fight corruption and aid had to be better coordinated .
Karzai faces scepticism over his determination to tackle corruption and the drug trade .
A World Bank report last week also questioned his government 's capacity to absorb a significant increase in aid .
The Bush administration offered more than $ 10bn and Britain was the second biggest bilateral donor , pledging $ 1.2bn .
In his address Karzai acknowledged the criticism of his government .
"" Afghanistan needs large amounts of aid , but precisely how aid is spent is just as important , "" he said , and he accepted that the opium industry was a "" major contributor to corruption "" .
But he warned donors not to forget that for Afghan farmers "" opium is about survival "" .
He also pointed out that the demand side of the opium industry was a western problem . ""
While opium is produced by Afghan farmers , its trafficking is an international phenomenon , "" he said .
Unease over Karzai 's tenure has been growing among western donors .
Instead of introducing reforms , critics say the president is building alliances with unsavoury characters in the run - up to presidential elections scheduled for late next year .

The Paris pledge will bring Britain 's aid to Afghanistan to $ 3bn since 2001 .
The 100th British soldier to die in Afghanistan since 2001 was killed over the weekend .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , insisted progress was being made .
"" The rapid economic growth is noteworthy ; the social progress in for example health care , where 82 % of Afghan citizens have basic health care compared to 9 % five years ago , allows us to build on success , "" he told the conference .
Afghanistan was entering a period of consolidation , he said .
"" But if we are going to be honest a period of consolidation has to address what 's wrong as well as building on what 's right . "" ."
2008-06-15,"Afghanistan 's president Hamid Karzai today inflamed tensions with neighbouring Pakistan by threatening to send troops across the border to hunt the Taliban leadership .
Karzai said his country had the right to defend itself against insurgents crossing from rear bases in Pakistan 's tribal belt .
His comments came as the manhunt for 900 escaped prisoners continued across southern Afghanistan .
"" When they cross the territory from Pakistan to come and kill Afghans and kill coalition troops , it exactly gives us the right to go back and do the same , "" he told journalists in Kabul . ""
Baitullah Mehsud should know that we will go after him now and hit him in his house , "" he said , referring to the militant leader accused of orchestrating the assassination of Benazir Bhutto . ""
And the other fellow , Mullah Omar of Pakistan , should know the same , "" he continued , referring to the Taliban 's one - eyed leader Mullah Omar .
His language and message was aggressive even by the testy standards of Afghan - Pakistani relations .
Pakistan 's prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani responded firmly , saying he would "" [ not ] allow anyone to interfere in our national limits and our affairs "" , and insisting that a stable Afghanistan was in Pakistan 's interests .
Karzai 's outburst came on the heels of Friday night 's spectacular jail break by the Taliban in Kandahar , when dozens of militants mounted a multi - pronged assault on the city jail that freed 890 prisoners including 390 Taliban fighters .
The US military said today that it killed 15 suspected insurgents during a firefight at a farmhouse outside Kandahar as troops combed the area the fugitives .
A statement said that fighters opened fire on coalition troops as they approached the building , prompting an American air strike .
That version of events could not be independently confirmed .
In Kandahar city authorities urged citizens to remain inside to facilitate the manhunt .
But a senior foreign official working there , speaking on condition of anonymity by phone , said traffic was flowing and people were venturing into the streets .
"" I do n't see anything abnormal , "" he said .
The jail break was another humiliation for Karzai , who survived an assassination attempt six weeks ago .
Addressing journalists in the Kabul presidential palace today , he said it demonstrated the need to strengthen security and "" to be a lot more alert and steadfast in our resolve in confronting terrorism "" .
But he reserved his harshest words for neighbouring Pakistan .
In the past Karzai called for western Pakistani soldiers to flush the Taliban from their tribal hide - outs , but never threatened to do the job himself .
Afghans would no longer flinch from going on what he termed a "" two - way road journey "" .
He said : "" We will complete the journey and we will get them and we will defeat them .
We will avenge all that they have done to Afghanistan for the past so many years . ""
The beleaguered president had just returned from a major donors ' conference in Paris where allies pledged $ 20bn to rebuild Afghanistan over the next five years -- $ 30bn less than the amount sought by the Afghan government .
Realistically Karzai can not despatch Afghan soldiers into Pakistan without consent from the US military and Nato , which together have around 62,000 troops in Afghanistan .
But there , too , tensions are rising .
Last week Pakistan protested furiously after US warplanes apparently bombed a Pakistani border post , killing 11 soldiers , as they pursued suspected insurgents fleeing across the border .
Both sides have agreed to a joint investigation .
In May American and allied deaths in Afghanistan passed the monthly toll in Iraq for the first time – a grim gauge of two conflicts going in opposite directions .
Five British soldiers have been killed in the past week .
A senior officer , Lieutenant Colonel David Richmond , commanding officer of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders , was shot in the leg during a firefight near Musa Qala .
American military and diplomatic officials warn that unless Pakistan shuts down the Taliban sanctuary in tribal hotbeds like Waziristan , the Afghan insurgency could drag on for many years .
Pakistan 's beleaguered government led by Yousaf Raza Gilani hopes to curb the problem through peace talks with militants like Mehsud .
Based in the mountain of South Waziristan , Mehsud heads
Tehrik I Taliban Pakistan , the largest militant grouping .
But negotiations are proceeding slowly and there is confusion about which branch of government is in charge .
Meanwhile gunmen continue to torch girls schools and execute suspected informants , such as a woman found beheaded near the Afghan border last week .
Gilani 's attention is also diverted by the continuing turmoil surrounding President Pervez Musharraf .
Despite vocal urgings from all the major parties , Musharraf has refused to resign , clinging to his support from the army and President George Bush .
But public pressure is growing .
On Friday night arch - rival and junior government partner Nawaz Sharif upped the ante by calling for Musharraf to be executed .
"" Is hanging only for politicians ? "" he told tens of thousands of lawyers and opposition activists gathered near the presidency , in a reference to former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , who was hanged by the military in 1979 .
"" Hang him , hang him "" responded the crowd ."

Backstory
The war of words between Pakistan and Afghanistan is as old as the Taliban .
Having nurse - fed them in the 1990s , Pakistan was forced to cut ties in 2001 .
Doubts persisted whether the break was complete .
A swelling chorus of Afghan and western officials accuse Pakistan of playing a double game - publicly shunning the Taliban but privately turning a blind eye , or even providing active help .
As the insurgency has grown , so has the sniping between the countries .
At one point recently President Pervez Musharraf accused Karzai of behaving "" like exactly an ostrich "" ."
2008-07-08,"The Afghan government today reiterated its veiled accusation that Pakistan orchestrated the Indian embassy bombing in Kabul yesterday that killed 41 people , including senior diplomatic staff .
A spokesman for Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , said officials had "" sufficient evidence "" to indicate that Pakistan 's intelligence agency was behind the atrocity . ""
[ The ] sophistication of this attack and the kind of material that was used , the specific targeting , everything has the hallmarks of a particular agency that has conducted similar attacks inside Afghanistan , "" Humayun Hamidzada said .
Hamidzada did not name Pakistan 's intelligence agency but told reporters that the identity of the agency was "" pretty obvious "" .
Yesterday 's bombing tore open the front gates of the Indian embassy , killing 41 people and wounding some 150 .
The Afghan interior ministry immediately accused a "" regional intelligence service "" of coordinating the attack - an unmistakable reference to Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence whose agents have been blamed before for being behind terrorist incidents in Afghanistan .
Gareth Price , a Pakistan analyst at the Chatham House think - tank , told theguardian.com that a series of incidents in recent months had "" ratcheted up the tension "" between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
They included the breakdown of peace deals between the Pakistani government and tribal leaders in areas bordering Afghanistan .
Also , the Afghan military and US - led coalition have accused Pakistan of failing to tackle Taliban strike teams , which are believed to take refuge in Pakistan .
The ability of yesterday 's attackers to gain access to the front of the Indian embassy indicated a high level of support , Price said .
"" [ Regular ] Taliban suicide bombers drive round until they happen to stop next to a foreign vehicle and then detonate their explosives .
But to get to most embassies you have to pass through a series of checkpoints , "" he said .
The Pakistani armed services , or sometimes rogue elements within them , were often accused of helping the Taliban , but hard evidence was scarce , Price added .
A correspondent writing in the Times of India recalled that the Indian embassy in Kabul was a regular target during Taliban rule . ""
So specific was the targeting of the Indian embassy that the officials used to leave their cars and other vehicles parked inside the Indonesian embassy , which is next to the Indian embassy , to keep them safe from the Taliban rockets , "" Dhananjay Mahapatra said . .
Among the blast 's victims were four Indians working in the embassy , including the military attache and a diplomat .
Pakistan 's prime minister today denied his country 's intelligence service was behind the attack .
Speaking in Malaysia , Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani said Pakistan had no interest in destabilising Afghanistan when both countries were fighting terrorism .
"" We want stability in the region .
We ourselves are a victim of terrorism and extremism , "" said Gilani on the sidelines of a summit of eight developing Islamic nations .
A senior official at the Inter - Services Intelligence said Afghanistan 's allegations were part of a smear campaign against Pakistan security agencies .
"" If they have any evidence to back up what they are claiming they should share it with Pakistan , "" the official said .
Yesterday 's blast was the deadliest in Kabul since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 ."
2008-07-19,"Tomorrow , there will be no presidential hopefuls , no hordes of advisers and staff , no senior TV anchors , none of the razzmatazz of an American election campaign .
The routine lack of routine that is life in Kabul will have been restored .
President Hamid Karzai will have a moment to ponder the past few days .
On Thursday , he travelled by ( American ) helicopter to the east of Afghanistan to offer his condolences to families of dozens of civilians killed in an ( American ) air strike two weeks ago .
On Friday , aides had no idea when Barack Obama would be arriving .
On Saturday , the candidate was there .
On Sunday , he was gone .
The complexities of the presidential diary are revealing .
For the bittersweet story of Karzai is also the bittersweet story of the Western involvement with Afghanistan .
In the heady aftermath of the 2001 war , everything seemed possible and Karzai , with his hawk nose , multicoloured Uzbek cape and astrakhan hat , was , like his country , handsome , brave , rugged , exotic and romantically wreathed in gunsmoke .
Convincing both at home and abroad , effective enough to be useful , malleable enough not to be a threat , he was the perfect friend in a far - flung land .
Seven years on , Karzai , like his country , has become a problem .
Tricky , conservative , proud , prickly , his views , like those of his countrymen , are not always those of his Western interlocutors .
He does not do what he is told .
In short , he is a bit too Afghan .
But then so , as we are discovering , is Afghanistan .
Karzai was born in 1957 in the village of Karz , in the south eastern province of Kandahar , one of eight children of the chief of the half - a - million - strong Popalzai and thus a scion of one of the most powerful tribes of Afghanistan .
Educated in Kabul and in India , he was 22 when the Soviets invaded his homeland .
For the next decade , based in Pakistan , Karzai was involved in liaison for a mujahideen faction .
In 1992 , he was with the first group of mujahideen leaders into a liberated Kabul and then watched the West walk away and his country dissolve into anarchy and civil war .
So when a religious militia known as the Taliban established rule of law in the mid-90s from bases in his native Kandahar , Karzai , like many Afghans , supported them .
Despite his apparent Westernisation , the President is , though far from an intolerant fundamentalist , a devout man .
He never touches alcohol - abroad or in private - and prays five times a day .
His piety is allied to a social conservatism that sees his wife , a literate medical doctor , kept out of sight .
Mrs Karzai was not much in evidence yesterday .
The excesses of the Taliban , as well as their probable murder of his father and the support they received from Pakistani intelligence services , turned Karzai against them .
But with nobody very interested in Afghanistan , lobbying in Western capitals went nowhere .
Until 9/11 changed everything .
Just under two months after the attack , Karzai , armed with little more than a satellite phone , some CIA contact numbers , his old mujahideen networks and the loyalty owed to him as chief of the Popalzai , headed into Afghanistan .
It was an extremely brave gamble and it paid off .
By December 2001 , with the Taliban temporarily destroyed , and the old mujahideen leaders dead or discredited , he was the obvious man to take power .
Impressive in Western capitals , Karzai is at his best in Kabul where the painfully blue sky , the snowy mountains on the horizon , the danger , the wood smoke , the hawkers , the poverty and the simple fact of being there combine with the altitude to half stun many visiting statesmen . '
He 's well - read , funny and can talk about everything from 19th - century politics to poetry to pots , ' says one Westerner who has dealt closely with him .
Karzai is also charismatic and , for a head of state , unpretentious .
His abrupt , exuberant hand gestures give the impression of energy and decision .
In interviews , he often sits on the edge of his chair , listening intently , apparently barely able to contain his desire to act .
With Karzai head of an interim government backed by billions in international aid , endorsed by a traditional loya jirga assembly of tribal leaders , embraced by half the statesman of the planet , elected President for a five - year term in an astonishing and moving poll , 2002 saw the climax of the sudden love affair between the new Afghan leader and his country and the West .
And then things started going downhill .
This was not inevitable .
Part of the bitterness that Karzai will have sought to hide from Obama yesterday is a consequence of the unforced nature of the failures in Afghanistan .
Errors in Iraq made a very tough job virtually impossible .
Errors in Afghanistan have made a delicate task that could , given intelligence , subtlety , courage and luck , have been a relatively rapid success , much , much harder .
One early error was the decision to opt for ' nation building lite ' .
The West did the easy bits of Afghanistan first .
So Kabul , the relatively stable north , the prosperous western city of Herat all saw funds , troops and development while the tough and dangerous south east was left to rot .
So in came the consultants , the private contractors but far fewer soldiers with far less expertise in post - conflict or counter - insurgency training than were needed .
Instead of a massive military presence that could be downscaled to tighter , focused , special forces operations , the opposite happened .
Early military expeditions in search of ' al - Qaeda / Taliban ' were laughably clumsy .
Development progress was painfully slow .
And then everyone got distracted by Iraq .
It was 2006 before anyone woke up , despite Karzai 's increasingly shrill alarm calls .
In Kabul and the stable areas , the change in five years had been enormous .
Anyone who had seen Taliban Afghanistan could not but be impressed by the new telephone networks , reconstruction and commercial activity .
But while everyone looked away , the Taliban had regrouped , al - Qaeda had found a new safe haven in Pakistan , drugs production had exploded and in Kandahar 's hospitals small children were still dying of malnutrition .
The militants , with the complicity of opium and heroin smugglers , had filled the vacuum the West and the pitifully weak Afghan government had left .
When the British went into southern Helmand as part of a massive new Western deployment , they got a much nastier reception than anticipated and rows broke out between London and Kabul over political and military strategy .
Relations between Karzai and British policy - makers became venomous .
The Westerners were depicted as arrogant , blundering neo - imperialists .
Karzai was dismissed as ' the mayor of Kabul ' , an insult based partly in frustration at the President 's seeming inability to impose his will in the provinces .
Certainly , his air of decisiveness and energy hides a failure to energise or control even his close associates . '
It 's bewildering , ' said one former diplomat in Kabul . '
You 'd expect him to be charging around firing off memos , harassing subordinates ... but that is n't his style .
The exercise of power itself does n't seem to interest him - or perhaps he is just not very good at it . '
Yet Karzai 's defenders point out that no central government in Afghanistan has ever done anything other than rule through co - opted local power - brokers . '
This is not Sweden , ' said one aide .
Relations have not recovered .
Karzai is infuriated by foreigners ' blithe assumption that they ' understand the Afghan ' better than he and by misspent aid money .
He is genuinely outraged and wounded by the continued civilian casualties caused by hamfisted military strikes .
Angry and bellicose sallies against Pakistan , which he blames for much of the violence in his country , are symptomatic of a deep frustration with the failure of the international community to grasp the regional nature of the conflict as much as traditional Afghan anti - Pakistani sentiment .
Among the international community , there is frustration about a lack of progress on justice , accountability and women 's rights , principles which do not necessarily always agree with Karzai 's conservative views .
With security deteriorating , contact between the ' internationals ' and the Afghans , whether President or pauper , is now minimal .
Westerners increasingly move in heavily armed convoys , live behind blast walls and ship in their supplies from abroad .
Once welcomed , they are becoming just the latest in the series of powers over the centuries that have hoped to shape Afghanistan , if not in their image , then as they would like .
As the gulf widens , the unpleasant realisation is growing , perhaps none too soon , that Afghanistan is not just exotic and quaint but is very , very different and that Westerners here , American presidential hopefuls included , are a very , very long way from home .

Best of times
Already President of the Afghan Transitional Administration , Karzai won 55.4 per cent of the vote in the 2004 Afghan presidential election .
He was officially sworn in as the first elected President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on 7 December 2004 .
Worst of times Karzai 's father Abdul Ahad Karzai was assassinated by , it 's thought , the Taliban while organising resistance from his base in Quetta , Pakistan , in August 1999 .
Karzai himself survived an assassination attempt in December 2001 .
What he says ' It was terrorism that brutalised the whole of Afghanistan .
They tried to give it names and justifications , and those names and justifications were ethnic or political , but it was clearly a terrorist movement , backed by outsiders , to take Afghanistan and to create a different kind of warlord . '

2008-07-19,"It would be hard to deny the evidence that Afghanistan is at a crossroads as Democratic nominee Barack Obama yesterday met the country 's President Hamid Karzai .
Despite the claims by some British officers that the Taliban is being tactically routed , no one seems to have told the Islamist insurgents .
Opium production in the areas under their control - and that of other warlords - has reached new records this year .
Corruption and criminality , linked often to the very heart of government , is endemic .
Despite $ 15bn in aid that has been disbursed , Afghanistan remains mired in pervasive poverty with unemployment standing at more than 40 per cent .
The country 's position as one of the world 's poorest has barely shifted since 2001 .
Confronted with these multiple failures , the temptation , voiced yesterday by Obama , and by his Republican opponent John McCain already , is to throw more military forces at the problem in a replication of the Iraq ' surge ' .
A parallel attraction , encouraged by Karzai , is to insist that the international community provide ever more money in the hope that some of the billions will stick .
But in a country beset by rapidly increasing pessimism over the ability of the international community finally to bring to an end Afghanistan 's 30-year cycle of poverty and violence , what is needed is a large - scale rethinking of what we are doing in Afghanistan , not more violence and more largesse .
The reality , despite the claims of Nato and Western diplomats , is that the war is far from being won .
For many , it is becoming clear that it can not be won , framed in military terms .
Nor can it be won in terms of the present political settlement , largely imposed on Afghanistan , which has accepted a re - emergence of war - lordism , cronyism and the general collapse of legitimacy and the rule of law in exchange for the impression of a ' stable ' central government , albeit one which holds little sway outside of Kabul .
The tensions thus created have encouraged a return to a state of widening conflict .
There have been some positive steps since the fall of the Taliban regime .
Millions of children are in education in a country with a long history of high levels of illiteracy , particularly among women .
A vibrant media , although under threat from many sides , also exist .
Improvements have been made in the provision of healthcare .
But this is not enough to persuade Afghans that much is getting better when they are confronted daily by criminality , violence , a predatory police force and an ill - educated and corrupted civil service .
In Afghanistan , the real risk is that more is less .
The danger of sending ever more troops is that the civilian casualties that will follow in the intensifying conflict will push more Afghans towards the Taliban in a country with a history of fiercely asserting its independence .
The hazard of throwing more money at the problem is that without a tighter focus to that spending , Afghans see the increased aid budget as an opportunity for a small elite of Afghans and a small army of international contractors and aid workers to enrich themselves still further .
A further consequence is that , because it lacks a professional civil service to support the people , the aid community has shouldered the burden , inadvertently undermining still further the development of effective local services .
The lessons of Afghanistan , as Rory Stewart , a former British diplomat and Afghan expert now running an aid organisation in Kabul insisted last week , points to a more tightly targeted approach , concentrating aid efforts on areas of the country where visible improvements are viable , as a promise of what is possible elsewhere .
Some of the most successful schemes have been small - scale : micro - finance projects from Herat to Kabul and Mazar - i - Sharif have provided the tools , via education and small loans , to get people working , the greatest priority being on rural rehabilitation .
More widely , there needs to be acceptance that this is not a local conflict but a regional one .
Pakistan 's failure to tackle the Taliban 's safe havens in the tribally administered areas is stoking Afghanistan 's woes .
Finally , there needs to be an end to the cosy client relationship with Karzai , who has yet to show himself a capable leader , and a retreat from the West 's view that he is the country 's only possible saviour ."
2008-08-21,"9.55 AM : Gordon Brown is in Kabul this morning .
He stopped off in Afghanistan on his way to Beijing for the Olympics closing ceremony , and , after a trip to Helmand to visit British troops , he flew to the Afghan capital for a meeting with the president , Hamid Karzai .
They are due to hold a joint press conference soon .
Brown will want to talk about the fight against the Taliban , but it will be his first press conference since his summer holiday and he is also likely to face questions about the situation in Britain .
As he made it clear talking to journalists on his plane yesterday , he 's in fighting mood .
Click back for live coverage as soon as the press conference starts .
10:15AM :
My colleague , Deborah Summers , who 's with Brown in Kabul , has called to say the press conference should start soon .
But Gordon is being upstaged by Boris Johnson .
The mayor is in Beijing and he 's holding a press conference , which Sky and BBC News are covering live .
Boris has just coined the term "" Olympo - sceptics "" , and told the world that they are all being forced to think again because there is so much excitement in London about the games .
Brown is not going to want to start his press conference while Boris is still chuntering on .
10.35 AM :
Sky are reporting that Brown 's press conference has started , but that they ca n't show it live yet because of a massive sandstorm in Afghanistan .
So the prime minister has been upstaged by his Tory rival .
That wo n't go down well .
10.40 AM :
The press conference has popped up on News 24 now .
Brown says Britain wants to support the new democracy in Afghanistan , because he understands that what happens in the country affects the rest of the world .
He describes president Karzai as a "" great friend of mine "" .
10.45 AM :
He says that , in his talks ith the president , they discussed the next stage of development in the country .
He says that allowing the Afghan police and army to take control of security is the right way forward .
10.45 AM :
So Britain will do more to support the growth of the Afghan national army .
Brown met the commander of the Afghan army in Helmand earlier .
The British have trained around 4,000 Afghan soldiers .
There are now 60,000 soldiers in the army , and the numbers are going up .
It 's a "" high - quality army "" and the numbers may need to go up beyond 120,000 .
10.50 AM : Not only will Britain do more to train and mentor the Afghan army
, Britain will do more to train and mentor the police .
Britain has asked other European countries to double the number of people helping .
Britain has three assistant chief constables involved in training and it is committed to creating a corruption - free force .
Third , Britain will deploy civil service staff to help the Afghans build up their civil service .
An anti - corruption commissioner will be appointed .
Brown is pausing as he speaks , to allow time for his words to be translated .
It does n't make for good live TV and News 24 have now given up .
Sorry .
We have n't had much luck with the live blog today .
We 'll have to call it a day ."
2008-08-21,"Gordon Brown said he remained "" utterly resolute "" in his determination to defeat the forces of terrorism today as he likened British troops to Olympic heroes during a surprise visit to Afghanistan .
In a joint press conference with the country 's president , Hamid Karzai , the prime minister pledged his continued support in the reconstruction effort and pledged $ 17 m ( £ 9.13 m ) to set up a radio station in Helmand province so that "" people can receive their news objectively "" .
"" We are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of Afghanistan , "" Brown said .
"" We wo n't relax our efforts to support and reconstruct Afghanistan because we understand that what happens in Afghanistan affects the rest of the world .
"" We are determined to work with the Afghan government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism . ""
The sombre message came just hours after Brown toured a field hospital at Camp Bastion , in Helmand province in the south of the country , where he met six British soldiers who were receiving treatment after being hit by sniper fire .
Referring to the attack that killed 10 French soldiers , Brown said : "" What happened yesterday makes us even more resolved . ""
But despite the prime minister 's defiant message , he failed to shake off questions about his leadership back home .
During the press conference , Brown had to sidestep a barrage of claims from the British media that the foreign secretary , David Miliband , was after his job .
As the prime minister again insisted he was getting on with the business of government , Karzai lighten the atmosphere by interjecting : "" Plotting in the cabinet is not new .
It happens in Afghanistan too ...
But not to me .
"" The prime minister said he believed that coalition forces were making "" substantial advances "" against the Taliban .
"" We have succeeded in winning back territory .
The longer term solution is that more power will be given to the Afghanistan people . ""
Earlier the prime minister told British troops at Camp Bastion : "" You are the heroes of our country ...
You are the frontline against the Taliban ...
What you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of Britain . ""
The 300 or so troops who gathered in the 39C heat at 9.30am local time ( 6 am BST ) stood emotionless as Brown told them : "" This week we are celebrating the Olympics , where we have had great success .
People have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground . ""
But this week also I believe that our Olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage , professionalism and dedication .
You make our country proud every day of the week , every week of the year .
You are truly the heroes of our country .
"" I wish to say how proud I am of you today . ""
Morale at the main UK hub in Helmand was said to be high .
During Brown 's 90-minute visit , the troops from 16 Air Assault Brigade , made up of 2 and 3 Battalion Parachute Regiment , 5 Battalion Royal Regiment Scotland and the Royal Irish regiment , seemed in good humour .
Brown said afterwards : "" Morale among the troops is very strong .
They are gradually extending the area which we control .
We are also making great progress in training the Afghan army .
The government is determined to stamp out lawlessness . ""
Captain Phil Hobbs of 7 Armoured Company based in Germany , said that the prime minister 's visit did have a positive effect on the troops .
"" It shows we do have support for what we are doing , "" he said .
"" It gives us a sense of pride . ""
If the troops still have complaints about their equipment , they did not mention them .
One told how tents previously occupied by eight people were now being used by 14 because troops were in mid - rotation and those due to replace them in the field had already arrived .
On the upside , he said , the tents were air conditioned so the arrangement was manageable .
Lieutenant Colonel David Reynolds , a spokesman for Task Force Helmand , said : "" In the UK , all you see is young men dying out here .
The sacrifice they make is stability back home .
That is why we are here . """
2008-08-26,"Tensions increased today between Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , and US and Nato troops , with the government ordering a review of foreign military activities amid claims that dozens of civilians have died in raids and air strikes over the past week .
The ministries of foreign affairs and defence said they would seek to regulate raids with a status of forces agreement and a negotiated end to "" air strikes on civilian targets , uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of Afghan civilians "" .
The UN mission in Afghanistan has backed the government .
Afghan and foreign soldiers entered the village of Nawabad in Shindand district last Friday and called in air strikes , villagers told UN investigators .
The UN special envoy to Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said in a statement that an investigation "" found convincing evidence , based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others , that some 90 civilians were killed , including 60 children , 15 women and 15 men .
Fifteen other villagers were wounded .
"" The destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with seven to eight houses having been destroyed , with serious damage to many others , "" Eide said .
"" Local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties , including names , age and gender of the victims . ""
This is matter of grave concern to the United Nations .
I have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations . ""
The impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the Afghan people in efforts to build a just , peaceful and law - abiding state . ""
The US military has launched an investigation after saying it was unaware of any civilians killed .
An American spokesman said the strike targeted a known Taliban commander and killed 30 militants .
Captain Mike Windsor , a spokesman for Nato , said the force had not received any official notification about the government decision .
He said Nato 's mission was based on a UN mandate and carried out at the invitation of the Afghan government .
In an angry statement , the government said officials had "" repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets , especially in Afghan villages , to be stopped "" .
"" The issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of Afghanistan , which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in Afghanistan , "" it said .
"" Unfortunately , to date , our demands have not been addressed .
Rather , more civilians , including women and children , are losing their lives as a result of air raids . """
2008-09-09,"Asif Ali Zardari put the "" war on terror "" at the top of his agenda and signalled a thaw in relations with Afghanistan by having its leader , Hamid Karzai , at his inauguration yesterday as president of Pakistan .
In a short but emotional ceremony in the presidential palace in Islamabad , Zardari took the oath of office with a portrait of his assassinated wife , Benazir Bhutto , on one side and a picture of her father , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , Pakistan 's first elected leader , on the other .
Their three children - Bilawal , Bakhtawar and Asifa - had flown into the country for the event and sat in the front row .
Following Pervez Musharraf 's resignation last month , Zardari 's swearing - in ceremony formally ended nine years of military rule .
It raised hopes among investors and foreign allies led by the United States that it would bring a degree of stability after months of political turmoil and militant violence .
The presence of Karzai , the only foreign leader at the ceremony , was highly symbolic .
He has repeatedly accused Pakistan of aiding Taliban insurgents seeking to oust his Afghan government and providing them with sanctuary in the tribal border areas .
Karzai unexpectedly joined Zardari for a press conference after the oath - taking ceremony , where both presidents pledged to fight the militants which they said threaten both countries . ""
Pakistan and Afghanistan are like twins conjoined , "" said Karzai .
"" They are inseparable and that is why both are suffering from the same troubles , by the same evils .
"" Earlier this year , Karzai had been so troubled by the apparent safe haven afforded the Taliban in Pakistan 's tribal area that he threatened to take military action on Pakistani soil .
He also openly accused Pakistan 's intelligence services of complicity in the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in July .
India and the US have also alleged that Pakistan is backing extremists .
Zardari promised to work against militants , saying he too was a victim of terrorism .
"" We stand with our neighbours .
We shall stand with each other , we shall not stand in each other 's way , "" he said .
"" We will look at the problems in the eyes and tell the world that we are bigger than the problems are . ""
In practice , however , Pakistan 's policy towards Afghanistan and its own militants is decided by the military , not by the government .
There are signs that Washington is happier now with Pakistan 's military cooperation , though it is unclear whether the army has altered its view that the Karzai regime is too close to Pakistan 's arch - enemy , India .
Zardari will find it tough to sell the "" war on terror "" to voters .
He made it clear that his government had no intention of ending its ties with the US , which has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan in return for help in fighting Islamic militants .
Many Pakistanis oppose their country 's role in the "" war on terror "" , and blame it for fanning religious extremism .
The other major issue facing Zardari is the economic slump and spiralling prices that have pushed basic food commodities out of the reach of millions of ordinary people .
The president will also have to work to consolidate the still - fragile democratic rule in Pakistan and overcome allegations of corruption ."
2008-09-21,"Françoise Demulder 's obituary

The book is called A Walking Guide , rather than A Walking Tour .

2008-09-24,"On Tuesday , Sarah Palin arrived in New York to begin two days of talks with a succession of world leaders .
As she stood in front of the mirror on Monday evening , she must have wondered what an Alaskan hockey mom with a passport that has hardly a stamp upon it should wear to meet the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
And for this most international of occasions , she picked a pair of earrings in the shape of her home state of Alaska .
Forget about the rimless glasses ; Palin tells us a lot about herself through her choice of jewellery .
Her ear - wear displays a carefully crafted lack of sophistication .
During a campaign rally in her home state , she decided upon beaded earrings that looked as if they had been picked up at a local craft fair .
Accessorised with a glittery brooch that spelled out the word
Alaska , the look could n't have been more small - town America , more I 'm one of you , I 'm ordinary , I fight for my people .
It 's a universal wisdom that political women wear unobtrusive earrings .
Michelle Obama , when addressing the 2008 Democratic national convention , chose elegant , understated diamond studs .
When Hillary Clinton went campaigning , her lobes were usually graced with simple knots of gold , occasionally a pearl , never anything more ostentatious .
In contrast , Palin , on her trip to Mississippi to speak about the impending hurricane Gustav , sported an oversized pair of gold hoops .
Obama channelled Jackie O ; Palin drew inspiration from Britney Spears .
So what is Palin saying with her homage to Alaska ?
With terrifying literal - mindedness , these earrings express everything we need to know about her pride in her roots and her people .
At least no one will be in any doubt about where she 's from ."
2008-09-24,"If Sarah Palin was notably short on international experience before becoming the Republican 's vice - presidential candidate , by the end of today she should at least have brushed up on the basics of some of the major current global issues , from the Iraq war to Pakistan 's current plague of terrorist violence and Russia 's recent aggression in the Caucasus .
She is currently on a whistlestop tour of meeting rooms in New York to chat with visiting foreign dignitaries in town for the UN general assembly .
Yesterday she met Alvaro Uribe , the Colombian president , and Hamid Karzai , his Afghan equivalent , finishing off the day with a chat with the former US secretary of state and guru of global realpolitik , Henry Kissinger .
Today , the meet and greet itinerary includes Mikhail Saakashvilli , the president of Georgia , recently involved in a conflict with Russia .
Palin and the Republican camp have already been widely derided for claiming the fact that her home state of Alaska is near Russia gives Palin experience in Russian affairs .
No doubt she will be looking to arm herself with some more detailed insights into the complexity of the Caucasus region when she meets Saakashvilli , who will have the Ukrainian president , Viktor Yuschenko , alongside him .
Then it is on to the Middle East and Asia , with meetings lined up with the Iraqi president , Jalal Talabani , the Pakistani president , Asif Ali Zardari , and Manmohan Singh , the Indian prime minister .
Yesterday 's meetings were hit by criticism over media access .
The McCain campaign had tried to keep journalists out , initially insisting just a few photographers and one television camera could attend .
This caused a furore among the press and the campaign team had to back down when CNN , the pool camera crew , threatened to boycott the whole event .
Still , the New York Times ' political blog mocked that all it could glean from her meeting with Karzai was that she thought the name of his young son , Mirwais , which means "" the light of the house "" , was "" nice "" .
Gordon Brown is due to arrive in New York later today .
But having caused ire among the Republican campaign for indicating that he supported Barrack Obama 's candidacy , he is unlikely to get an audience .
Palin 's lineup is not just world leaders in suits .
U2 's frontman , Bono , will also be offering his thoughts on international relations to the pro - hunting anti - abortionist .
Can she really learn much from these short meetings ?
And who else should be on Palin 's must - see list for a thorough grounding in foreign affairs ?"
2008-10-07,"On the first day of I d al - Fitr , President Hamid Karzai had a great treat in store for his people .
In a speech he said : "" A few days ago I pleaded with the leader of the Taliban , telling him ' My brother , my dear , come back to your homeland .
Come back and work for peace , for the good of the Afghan people .
Stop this business of brothers killing brothers ' .
""
My brother ?
My dear ?
Yes , and yes again .
Karzai is an Afghan version of the metrosexual man .
He sometimes even cries publicly , though that 's not to everyone 's taste .
My favourite Karzai moment was a couple of years ago when he told Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad : "" In this country [ Afghanistan ] , women are in charge . ""
He was daydreaming , of course , but I still felt flattered .
The truth is that Karzai has been beseeching Mullah Omar for a long time .
So , in a way , nothing new has happened .
This , however , is not entirely correct because there is one new element .
Ladies and gentlemen , please stand up to welcome the leader of the Muslim world ( not my words , Karzai 's ) :
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia .
He 's been asked to help enable high - level negotiations with the Taliban .
Or , as one Afghan website put it : "" Karzai stretched out his arms and grabbed the Saudi King 's cloak , asking the king to help him negotiate with the Taliban . ""
And the Saudi reaction ?
Their king welcomed an Afghan delegation led by Abdul Ahad Shinwari , the chief of Afghanistan 's state - sponsored mullahs .
Then there was an editorial in the Saudi newspaper , Al - Watan , which irritated some Afghan newsmen .
The editorial was penned by the paper 's editor – in - chief , and suggested Afghanistan is in trouble because of both al - Qaida and the Americans .
Remove these two from the scene
and you get a peaceful , stable country .
To which an Afghan website retorted that during the Taliban regime , the Saudis had offered Mullah Omar military equipment and millions of dollars .
The website alleged that such support continues through to this day .
Quoting a source close to the Taliban , it said : "" The generosity that wealthy Saudi and Gulf Arab sheikhs are displaying now by far exceeds the openhandedness they showed during the time of the jihad against the Soviet Union … "" In other words , al - Watan is not entirely honest .
Or suffering from memory loss .
Or both .
As for local reaction in Afghanistan , opinions varied .
Ahmad Behzad , an MP from Herat province , made clear his opposition bluntly .
He said : "" If the government and the international community entered into negotiations with the terrorists , it would be an utter disgrace .
It would mean that the international community has accepted defeat in Afghanistan . ""
He went on : "" The international community came here to fight terrorism , not to come to an understanding with it . ""
Ouch !
The Afghan daily Hasht - e Sobh was equally unhappy , but for different reasons .
In an editorial headlined "" A deal - making that 's been called peace - making "" , the paper listed its objections .
First , negotiations are kept secret and that makes them objectionable on principle .
Second , the Taliban are presently under threat because Islamabad has turned against them .
Why should we offer them peace now , of all times ?
Third , and more importantly , if calm in Afghanistan is reached through negotiation with the Taliban , this will translate into more violence in Pakistan .
After all , this has been the Pakistani experience .
They tried "" for many years to ensure security in their own country by enflaming violence in Afghanistan "" .
But the violence finally caught up with them , too .
Do unto others as you would be done by .
Fahim Dashti , editor - in - chief of Kabul Weekly , was similarly doubtful in a recent interview with Radio France International 's Persian service .
He said the two sides in this negotiation have absolutely nothing in common .
This is because the Taliban is totally against everything that Kabul apparently stands for , "" democracy , the rule of law , human rights , women 's rights and free speech "" .
Fahim said the offer of talks could in fact be a tactic to create disharmony among the Taliban .
This is because the Taliban "" are finding themselves under immense pressure because of Pakistani military operations "" .
In other words , they 're weak and may succumb to temptation and accept the peace offer .
Dashti added that the offer has another , more personal dimension .
It could be Karzai 's way of trying to ensure the support of the conservatives in the 2009 presidential elections .
And here is yet another version .
Since it was the English ( yes the English , not the British ) and the Saudis who originally created the Taliban , now they have to support them and this is how they are trying to bring the Taliban back to power .
( Hang on , I thought Benazir Bhutto was the one who created the Taliban .
After all , that 's why she was called Taliban Mom . )
Be this as it may , the main question is whether the people of Afghanistan support negotiation with Mullah Omar .
I put this question to an Afghan journalist whose opinion I regard highly because he travels to the far corners of the country to speak to ordinary people .
His answer was a solid , firm "" No "" .
The people most certainly do n't want Mullah Omar back .
What do they want ?
The same things that westerners want : security , electricity , running water .
In his view , the problem is not that the Taliban is strong but that the government is weak .
Here 's an example .
You 've got a district near the Pakistani border where there are 40,000 people .
But they 've only 40 policemen .
So a bunch of Taliban come and take over a village willy - nilly .
They 're not strong .
We 're weak .
And the Saudis ?
Karzai 's cabinet is too westernised for their taste .
It 's their way of trying to regain influence in the administration , by bringing back Mullah Omar ."
2008-10-09,"US intelligence agencies believe the war in Afghanistan is in "" a downward spiral "" , sparking an urgent strategy rethink by the Bush administration as it enters its last three months in office , it was reported yesterday .
The National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Afghanistan , a joint report by America 's 16 spy agencies , is not due to be published until after next month 's presidential election , but a draft version was leaked to US newspapers calling into question the coherence of US and Nato policy .
The document also places considerable blame on Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , for failing to control corruption in his government .
It also points to the destabilising impact of the booming opium trade , which now accounts for at least half the national economy .
The White House has ordered a review of its policy and sent a team to Kabul led by Lieutenant General Douglas Lute , the president 's military adviser on Afghanistan , to assess the situation .
"" We have had a tough summer .
There is no doubt about it , "" a Nato source told the Guardian .
"" There are concerns , and we would share concerns the NIE has identified for better Afghan governance .
We have said for some time the solution is political and not military . ""
The Afghan government has been reported to be holding talks with the Taliban , hosted by Saudi Arabia , but it is unclear whether those contacts would lead to comprehensive peace talks .
Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , has argued that Nato troops must confront Afghanistan 's drug traffickers directly .
The job has been left to Afghanistan 's poorly trained and under - equipped police force .
""
Part of the problem that we face is that the Taliban make somewhere between $ 60 m and $ 80 m or more a year from the drug trafficking , "" Gates said at a Nato meeting in Budapest yesterday . "" ...
if we have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try to interrupt this flow of cash to the Taliban , that seems to me like a legitimate security endeavour . ""
A proposed counter - narcotics mandate for Nato in Afghanistan divides opinion in Whitehall , putting the Foreign Office at odds with the Ministry of Defence .
The Foreign Office welcomed the move yesterday , saying Britain had been requesting it for years , in the face of resistance from some European allies .
But British military officials were more sceptical , saying such operations would require the deployment of more forces .
"" You can put your troops into counter - insurgency or you can go after the [ drug trafficking ] middleman but you ca n't do both , "" said a defence source .
British officers see the benefits of targeting drug laboratories and trafficking kingpins .
But they argue that such operations should be undertaken primarily by Afghan forces , with Nato providing support .
British diplomats are keen to emphasise that counter - narcotics efforts to date have brought results .
They point to UN figures showing a 19 % reduction in land under poppy cultivation last year , and a 6 % fall in opium production .
( The discrepancy between the two figures is explained by higher yields per hectare ) .
The NIE on Afghanistan appears destined to become an election issue in the final weeks of the contest between Barack Obama and John McCain .
The Pentagon plans to send another three brigades , up to 14,000 troops , to bolster the 33,000-strong US force there now , but in Budapest yesterday , US officials were urging their allies not to pull out when the American reinforcements arrive .
Meanwhile the United Arab Emirates has quietly become the 41st country contributing to the coalition effort in Afghanistan , although it is not clear what resources it intends to contribute .
The draft NIE on Afghanistan illustrates a darkening mood in western capitals .
It follows a leaked French diplomatic dispatch quoting the British ambassador to Kabul , Sherard Cowper - Coles , as saying US strategy there had failed .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , said the report had "" garbled "" the British position ."
2008-11-05,"The US military said today it was investigating reports that a bombing strike it carried out on a remote Afghan village killed dozens of members of a wedding party , including more than 20 children .
Details of the attack in the Shah Wali Kot district in Kandahar province remain sketchy .
However , Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , used an address today congratulating Barack Obama on his US election victory to demand an end to such deaths .
"" We can not win the fight against terrorism with air strikes , "" Karzai said .
"" This is my first demand of the new president of the United States , to put an end to civilian casualties . ""
A US military spokesman in Afghanistan said the reports were still being looked into , adding : "" If innocent people were killed in this operation , we apologise and express our condolences . ""
One man , Abdul Jalil , told the Associated Press that said he was hosting a wedding party for his niece on Monday when the village , Rosi Khan , was targeted by a US air strike .
Taliban forces had been battling American forces and took shelter nearby , he added .
A total of 37 people were killed , he said , including 23 children and 10 women .
Although Karzai is a staunch US ally , increasing anger over civilian deaths is threatening to destabilise relations between his country and Washington .
The reported attack on the village comes three months after the Afghan government said that a US operation had killed around 90 civilians in the west of the country .
A US report said 33 civilians died .
Another villager , Mohammad Zahir , said he had counted 36 bodies following the latest US air strike .
Another , Mohammad Nabi Khan , said he saw about 50 .
"" There 's a lot of casualties , "" he said at Kandahar 's main hospital .
"" Most of them were women and children .
Many are still buried under the rubble of homes .
"" It was impossible to get independent confirmation of the casualty numbers .
Rosi Khan is a remote village , about two hours by road from Kandahar city .
One of Karzai 's brothers , Wali Karzai , the head of Kandahar 's provincial council , said he knew about the raid but did not know the number of dead .
"" We are aware that civilians have died in air strikes conducted by foreign forces in Shah Wali Kot , "" he told the AFP news agency .
"" But at this time we do n't know how many . ""
Reporters working for AFP and Reuters said they saw women and children being treated in Kandahar 's hospital for shrapnel wounds and burns .
An estimated 4,000 people , about a third of them civilians , have died this year during fighting involving the Taliban .
The great majority of the civilians who died were killed in Taliban attacks , especially suicide and roadside bombs ."
2008-11-12,"He did n't look pleased , said a local paper about Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's reaction to Obama 's election victory .
The KabulPress website went even further , saying the whole presidential palace in Kabul is mourning the Republicans ' defeat in Washington .
If I were Karzai , I too would be upset .
No more happy rides in the Bush mobile under the blue Texan sky .
No more bragging about special friends in the White House .
No more "" I was on the phone to President Bush last night
and we talked about the Konar River "" , blah , blah , blah .
The local papers say now that the Republicans in the US have been told to clear off , it 's time for their Afghan stooges to quit too , for Afghanistan is in dire need of change .
The fact is that Afghans had their own moment of hope seven years ago with the fall of the Taliban , but thanks to US neocons and their Afghan allies that hope died rapidly .
In the words of Bahlol Lodhi , a contributing writer for the Anti - War website , "" The shibboleth that Afghanistan is a democracy with a constitution , an elected president , and an elected parliament must be consigned to the dustbin of bad jokes .
The Afghan people certainly do n't believe it , nor do those foreign professionals whose careers have not depended on inventing and perpetuating the myth .
"" You can click here to read Lohdi 's excellent piece , providing insight into what went wrong in post Taliban Afghanistan ,
how and why .
Still , with Obama 's victory hope has returned to Afghanistan .
Not the jubilant , teary - eyed hope of the Americans , but the cautious hope of a people who had three decades of exposure to US foreign policy and hence know Washington far too well to get all emotional .
I will not go into details of US "" mistakes "" in Afghanistan , such as unlawful arrests or civilian air strike casualties , because Cif readers often volunteer to list them in their comments , but suffice it to say that if we lived in a truly fair world , the US would offer an apology to the Afghan people .
That day may come yet , but for now , here 's how the local press reacted to Obama 's victory . ""
Many politicians and observers are optimistic that Barack Obama 's presence in the White House will lead to an untying of the twisted strategic knot in Afghanistan , "" said an article on the KabulPress news website .
A poster responded to this optimistic view with a note of caution .
He said that some warlords have already started trying to endear themselves to the US president - elect , presumably in the hope of gaining Obama 's support – much - needed if any of them were to try and become Afghanistan 's president in the 2009 election .
Take the example of Borhanuddin Rabbani , the man who was the Afghan president during the civil war years of the early 1990s .
He "" has sent a message of congratulation to Obama , presenting himself as a symbol of democracy and human rights "" .
Rabbani a symbol of human rights and democracy ?
But wait , it gets even better .
Apparently , Rabbani 's message finishes with a cute little pun : "" Obamas "" , meaning "" he is with us "" in Dari .
The fear that Afghan warlords might have misunderstood Obama 's message of "" Yes we can "" , interpreting it as a message of empowerment for war - criminals rather than the people , also echoed in an editorial by the daily newspaper Arman - e Melli .
The editorial said a number of opportunists who , for eight years , have been willingly dancing to George Bush 's drum have now begun to sing Obama 's praise : "" They hit their chests with their fists shouting slogans of Obama - worship .
But they are ignorant of the fact that the people of Afghanistan know exactly who supported the school of extremist thought led by George Bush .
""
The paper added that this time , the public is not going to be fooled by beautiful political slogans formulated in election times .
"" Obama must also strive for change in Afghanistan , "" said a headline on the Salam Watandar news website .
The article said in a recent press conference , Afghan MPs told reporters that the people of Afghanistan also desire change .
Watandar quoted Ahmad Behzad , an MP from Herat province , as saying that the new US administration should only lend its support to the people of Afghanistan and try not to back any particular candidate in next year 's presidential election .
This is to make sure that "" the future president of Afghanistan is not elected from within the confines of a foreign embassy in Kabul "" . ""
By electing Obama , Americans have opted for the path of negotiation and communication , "" said Payam - e Mujahid .
The paper said that in view of the present crisis in the US , change is not going to happen overnight .
But still , by making the right choice , Americans have made their first step in the right direction .
As elsewhere in the world , Obama 's victory received much praise and admiration in independent local media outlets , but two parties stood out for keeping their cool and remaining aloof .
One was the Afghan government and the other , its current arch - enemy , the Taliban .
Hence , state - run newspapers refrained from making a fuss about Obama 's victory , while the Taliban spokesman , Qari Yusuf Ahmadi , said that the Taliban felt neither joy nor sorrow over Obama 's election .
That 's the reaction by the independent press and the official line , then , but what about Kabul 's rumour market ?
It was bustling as usual .
Word has it that as soon as the election was decided in the US , secret meetings started to take place behind closed doors in Kabul and Dubai .
In Dubai , the official cover was a gathering of the business community , though in reality , key political figures had come together , feverishly absorbed in political bargaining in an effort to come up with an acceptable candidate for the 2009 presidential election .
The energetic to - ing and fro - ing was driven by the suspicion that the US has already chosen its own favorite Afghan candidate , who will be kept in reserve for now but revealed come election time .
The UK , another rumour goes , also has its own plans .
That 's why over the recent weeks the British envoy has been seen going back and forth between the embassy and the presidential palace where private meetings were held with President Karzai .
True or not , the Afghan rumour bazaar is right about one thing – the new US administration is determined to see Republican supporters in Afghanistan pack up their belongings and quit the scene ."
2008-11-16,"Hamid Karzai , today offered to provide security for the Taliban 's reclusive leader , Mullah Omar , if he agrees to enter peace talks , saying the US and other nations could remove him as Afghanistan 's president if they disagree .
His comments come as international political and military leaders are increasingly mulling whether negotiating with the Taliban is necessary as the insurgency gains sway in large areas of Afghanistan .
Karzai has long supported drawing the Islamist militia into the political mainstream on the condition that they accept the country 's constitution . ""
If I say I want protection for Mullah Omar , the international community has two choices : remove me or leave if they disagree , "" Karzai said in an hour - long press conference in Kabul .
"" If I am removed in the cause of peace for Afghanistan by force by them , than I will be very happy .
If they disagree , they can leave .
But we are not at that stage yet . ""
Omar is a leader of the Afghan Taliban and headed the government toppled by the US - led invasion in 2001 .
Since then , he has been in hiding and is believed to be running the insurgency .
Previously , Karzai has said that Omar lives in neighboring Pakistan , an allegation dismissed by Pakistani officials .
Seven years after the invasion , record levels of violence are afflicting Afghanistan , where the number of insurgent attacks are up by 30 percent compared to 2007 .
The Taliban are present in large parts of Afghanistan 's south and east and are increasingly encroaching on Kabul , the capital .
In September , Taliban members met Afghan and Pakistani officials during a dinner hosted by Saudi Arabia 's king , but there were no concrete results from the meeting . ""
If I hear from [ Mullah Omar ] that he is willing to come to Afghanistan or to negotiate for peace and for the well - being of the Afghans so that our children are not killed anymore , I as president of Afghanistan will go to any length to provide protection , "" Karzai said .
Omar has not directly responded to these calls , but spokesmen associated with the Taliban have previously said their participation in any talks depends on the withdrawal of US and other foreign troops from the country .
Karzai has dismissed that , saying foreign troops are necessary for Afghanistan 's security ."
2008-11-17,"As international pressure mounted for negotiations with insurgents , Afghan president Hamid Karzai said yesterday that he would guarantee the security of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar if he decided to enter into talks .
Karzai told a news conference in the Afghan capital that he would not bow to demands from the international community to turn Omar over to US authorities if he agreed to negotiate a peace settlement with Karzai 's government . ""
As for Mullah Omar and his associates , if I hear from him that he is willing to come to Afghanistan or to negotiate for peace and for liberty so that our children will not be killed any more , I ... will go to any length to provide him security , "" Karzai said .
"" If I say I want protection for Mullah Omar , the international community has two choices : remove me or leave , "" he added .
Karzai made his remarks after weeks of speculation that negotiations were under way between the Afghan government and insurgent leaders .
In September , representatives from Karzai 's government met former Taliban leaders in Saudi Arabia .
Omar , a reclusive but fierce military commander , ruled the country until the fall of the Taliban government in 2001 .
The US has offered a multimillion dollar reward for his capture ."

2008-12-03,"No more British troops should be sent to Afghanistan unless other countries make greater efforts to promote the economic and political development of the country , senior British military officials have said .
They are also concerned about the inability of Hamid Karzai 's government to impose itself outside the capital , Kabul , and that the Taliban are winning the propaganda war .
Frustration among British military commanders is coming out into the open .
It was reflected in a forthright but little - noticed speech by Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , chief of the defence staff .
He said Britain could not simply make a "" one - for - one transfer "" when most of the 4,100 UK troops based at Basra airport leave in the first half of next year .
He added : "" I 'm not saying that we could n't or should n't do more in Afghanistan if we judge that to be necessary .
What I am saying is that we have to be able to sustain whatever we do . ""
Stirrup said it was not enough just to deploy more British troops to southern Afghanistan to add to the 8,000 already there .
What was needed , he said , was help in building up the Afghan economy and civil society .
"" I and others , have been saying for over two years now that we have to get a grip of the civilian effort , "" he told the Royal United Services Institute on Monday .
Billions of pounds of international aid pouring into Kabul is not being distributed to the people or projects that need it most , British defence officials say .
That means Afghans can not appreciate what British soldiers are trying to do : provide security to help promote economic and social progress .
Stirrup said the failure helped the Taliban in the information war , which they were winning because of the inadequacies of international organisations including Nato .
Killing civilians in air strikes eroded consent , he said , even though the Taliban were sometimes responsible for the casualties and British forces withheld fire because of the threat to civilians ."
2008-12-11,"The former Foreign Office minister with responsibility for Afghanistan yesterday accused the country of being corrupt "" from top to bottom "" , and said the international community had wrongly treated President Hamid Karzai with kid gloves .
The criticism came from Kim Howells , who was in charge of the Afghanistan brief for three - and - a - half years until he stepped down as a foreign affairs minister in the October government reshuffle .
The remarks reflect his considered judgment on what has been described as the most difficult foreign policy challenge facing the UK government and its armed forces .
Breaking his silence on the issue , he told MPs : "" Institutionally , Afghanistan is corrupt from top to bottom .
There are few signs that the chaotic hegemony of warlords , gangsters , presidential placemen , incompetent and under - resourced provincial governors and self - serving government ministers has been challenged in any effective way by President Karzai . ""
On the contrary , those individuals appear to be thriving , not least because Hamid Karzai has convinced himself that he can not afford to sack or challenge the strongmen who , through corruption , brutality , power of arms or tribal status are capable of controlling their territories and fiefdoms . ""
Howells told the Guardian that Karzai had repeatedly put pressure on the Foreign Office not to back the dismissal of corrupt and brutal provincial governors .
He told MPs that British public support for the war in Afghanistan was fragile .
The government , he said , "" will be asked , quite properly , why the lives of our service personnel should be risked ...
We will be asked why we are fighting to preserve what looks remarkably like a regime that is being undermined by corrupt cliques that have access to the highest levels . ""
He said the government had to change its "" daft "" rhetoric on the war . ""
Forget the nonsense about being prepared to fight on the mountains and plains of Afghanistan for 30 years .
People will not accept the notion that British families should send their sons and daughters , grandsons and granddaughters to risk their lives fighting religious fanatics , tribal nationalists , corrupt warlords and heroin traffickers in one of the most godforsaken terrains on the face of the earth .
The notion is daft , however much we may try to rationalise it by arguing that it is better to fight al - Qaeda over there than over here . ""
He said the only hope of peace lay in Nato countries being more willing to fight , especially the Germans , and in persuading Karzai to tackle corruption and start a proper process of reconciliation .
Howells ' remarks come as Gordon Brown conducts a review of Britain 's Afghan policy in light of Barack Obama 's decision to make Afghanistan his main priority .
Howells is chairman of the intelligence and security committee responsible for overseeing the security services , an appointment that reflects the high standing he is still held in by Downing Street .
He was joined by another former foreign office minister , Derek Twigg , who said he had been constantly frustrated by the failure of Britain 's Nato partners to commit themselves to fighting in Afghanistan ."
2008-12-15,"George Bush today pledged that the US would not walk away from Afghanistan despite the rising levels of violence in the country .
After flying from Baghdad - where an Iraqi reporter called him a "" dog "" and threw his shoes at him - under cover of darkness , the US president expressed confidence that the west would succeed in Afghanistan because its cause was just .
"" I told the president you can count on the United States , "" Bush , alongside the Afghan leader , Hamid Karzai , told a news conference in Kabul . ""
Just like you 've been able to count on this administration , you will be able to count on the next administration as well . ""
Bush arrived in Afghanistan as the resurgent Taliban is tightening its grip around Kabul and other major cities .
The US president - elect , Barack Obama , has accused the Bush administration of neglecting Afghanistan , and has promised to make the country a higher priority .
Bush - who has already ordered more troops for Afghanistan - appeared to lend tacit support to Obama 's pledge to further increase troop levels after he takes office next month .
"" I want him to succeed , I want him to do well , "" he said .
"" I 'd expect you 'll see more US troops here as quickly as possible in parts of the country that are being challenged by the Taliban . ""
However , Bush said much progress had been made in Afghanistan since US and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban after the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001 .
When accused by an Afghan reporter of failing to make good on US promises to bring security , Bush said : "" I respectfully disagree ...
I just cited the progress .
It 's undeniable .
I never said the Taliban was eliminated ,
I said they were removed from power .
They are lethal and they are tough . ""
Bush said it was important for the US to keep working with Pakistan to pressure militants along its border with Afghanistan .
The al - Qaida leader , Osama bin Laden , and his top lieutenants are believed to be hiding in the remote and lawless region .
"" If Pakistan is a place from which people feel comfortable attacking infrastructure , citizens , troops , it 's going to make it difficult to succeed in Afghanistan , "" Bush said .
"" The more we can get Pakistan and Afghanistan to co - operate , the easier it will be to enforce that part of the border regions .
"" Bush was making his second trip to Afghanistan since 2001 .
Around 65,000 foreign troops , including 32,000 from the US , are in Afghanistan and struggling to contain the Taliban .
The US president 's surprise stop in Afghanistan was accompanied by high security .
It followed a five - hour visit to Iraq that was marked by a raucous press conference at which an Iraqi reporter threw two shoes at him . ""
This is your farewell kiss , you dog ! ""
the protester shouted in Arabic .
Bush ducked both shoes as they whizzed past his head and landed against the wall behind him .
"" It was a size 10 , "" he joked later .
The president 's visit to Afghanistan and Iraq came just 37 days before he hands the war over to Obama , who has pledged to end it .
He aimed to highlight a drop in violence and celebrate a recent US - Iraq security agreement calling for US troops to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011 .
Obama has called Afghanistan an "" urgent crisis "" , saying it was time to heed the call from US commanders there for significantly more US troops .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , preceded Bush in both Afghanistan and Iraq .
Before meeting General David McKiernan , the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan last week , Gates said the US military would pour thousands of additional troops into Afghanistan by next summer .
Commanders have called for up to 20,000 more US troops in Afghanistan , and addressing the situation there is fast becoming a top military priority for the US .
The Taliban is especially strong in southern Afghanistan , where British troops are operating .
Gates said the increase in US forces was especially important prior to national elections scheduled to take place next autumn ."
2008-12-30,"1 Fighting will intensify in Afghanistan , especially along the Pakistan border .
Doubts over Hamid Karzai 's corruption - plagued government , insufficient western development assistance , and Nato 's cohesiveness will add to instability .
2 International Islamist terror groups , linked to or aping al - Qaida , will continue to pose a significant security threat to Britain and western interests in general .
But as the Mumbai atrocities showed , terrorism is unpredictable .

The big test of Iraq 's stability will come mid - year when US forces withdraw from cities and towns and allies such as Britain leave .

An international criminal court arrest warrant against Sudan 's President Omar al - Bashir could result in obstruction of UN peacekeepers and postponement of national elections .

7 Economic pressures in Iran could see President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ousted in elections in June .
8 Nuclear proliferation will be of concern in 2009 as technical know - how becomes more widely available .
9 Russia 's relationships with its near neighbours are certain to give rise to further worries in 2009 following last summer 's war with Georgia .

2009-01-22,"The US military is investigating claims that more than two dozen Afghan civilians were killed during an attack on militants .
The issue has badly undermined support for the international coalition and President Hamid Karzai .
As Karzai seeks re - election later this year , he has used the issue of civilian deaths to try to distance himself from the west and has repeatedly called for more care to be taken by coalition troops .
A night - time raid on Monday killed 19 militants , some 30 miles north of Kabul , the US said .
But , according to some reports , civilians died .
Taliban fighters tend to use ordinary homes as cover , making it difficult for Afghan and international forces to avoid harming innocent bystanders .
The incident occurred in a village in the Tagab valley , a militant hotbed in Kapisa province , when groups of fighters ran out of buildings and opened fire on coalition soldiers , who called in aerial bombardment .
The Afghan news agency Pajhwok quoted villagers saying that 25 civilians had been killed .
The US military vowed to "" determine the truth "" .
"" We take reports of civilian casualties very seriously , "" said Colonel Greg Julian , the US forces ' Afghanistan spokesman .
"" Our primary effort is to provide security for the Afghan population and we operate in strict accordance with our commander 's directive . ""
Bai Jan , a resident of Anzari village , told Pajhwok that the foreign troops blew up five houses at about 2 am .
According to one tribal elder quoted in the report , there were no Taliban or fighters of Hizb - i - Islami , an allied extremist group , in the area .
Five of the dead were women , the report said .
American forces said that they had received confirmation from local Afghan officials that only insurgents were killed but that an investigation was continuing .
Among the dead , the US said , was the local Taliban commander Mullah Patang .
"" All the people we killed were militants but there is a formal investigation process we go through , "" said Lieutenant Commander Walter Matthews .
The Afghan interior ministry also said that it had launched an inquiry .
"" We 're not sure whether enemies were killed or civilians , "" said a spokesman , Zemarai Bashary .
Karzai wants greater control over coalition forces , including an order that would ban them from searching Afghan homes .
Haroun Mir , deputy director of Afghanistan 's centre for research and policy studies , an independent thinktank , said : "" Karzai has made civilian deaths a big issue , he 's constantly talking about it .
I think it 's because he 's been criticised by the western media and officials and he feels humiliated , abandoned by the US . """
2009-01-29,"Afghanistan 's election commission has announced that the country 's presidential election will be held on 20 August , when voters around the country will decide whether to keep President Hamid Karzai on the job .
The election was due this year in the spring , according to the Afghan constitution , but Azizullah Loden , the head of the country 's Independent Election Commission , said the security situation was not strong enough to hold elections then .
Loden said that additional international forces would arrive in the coming months , and that their presence would improve security and allow the vote to go ahead .
US military leaders have said that up to 30,000 new American forces could be sent to Afghanistan in 2009 .
Thousands of those troops are being sent to the country 's south , Afghanistan 's most violent region .
The delay in the vote , which effectively gives Karzai several more months in office than the five - year term he was elected to , is allowed by a clause in the constitution addressing a lack of security for a peaceful vote , Loden said .
Other Afghan officials have said the country simply does n't have enough time to declare candidates , print ballots and distribute them by the spring .
Distributing ballots in Afghanistan 's mountains during winter or early spring would be an impossible task , officials said .
Several Afghan politicians have said they will run against Karzai , but none of the candidates who have declared so far was expected to present Karzai with a strong challenge .
Election officials have been holding voter registration drives around the country over the last several months .
But worries have arisen that Afghans in the country 's most violent districts will not be able to take part in the vote ."
2009-01-29,"Afghanistan 's presidential elections , due this year , were delayed by several months today and serious concerns remain about whether the polls can be held even by the new date in August .
President Hamid Karzai 's term officially expires in May , but electoral officials announced the delay to allow time to improve security .
The brutal success of the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan means that much of the south and east of the country is mired in violence , making electioneering and voting highly dangerous .
The announcement of a date , 20 August , by Afghanistan 's election commission is likely to bring out a number of candidates to challenge Karzai .
It puts the onus on the new Barack Obama administration to decide whether Washington will continue to back the incumbent . ""
If the Americans are looking for continuity and stability , Mr Karzai is their candidate , "" said Haroun Mir , the deputy director of Afghanistan 's Centre for Research and Policy Studies , an independent thinktank in Kabul .
"" If they want to look for change , I do n't think that President Karzai is the kind of person who can bring change in Afghanistan . ""
There has been increasingly pointed criticism of Karzai from US officials , with his government seen as ineffectual and riddled with corruption .
Obama has made Afghanistan the centrepiece of his foreign policy , so much rides on stabilising the country .
Obama and the US military are constructing a new policy for Afghanistan that will involve doubling the number of American soldiers deployed there over the next few months to around 60,000 , as well as engaging Afghan tribes to help fight the insurgents and possibly entering into some sort of negotiations with the Taliban .
The independent election commission chief , Azizullah Ludin , said 20 August was chosen for the poll after consulting with Afghan and international security forces .
"" They told us there will be new security forces here ... and they will guarantee security , "" Ludin said .
Karzai has not stated that he will run again but has strongly hinted at it .
He has sought to distance himself from the international coalition by lambasting civilian casualties caused by foreign troops .
Among the possible rival candidates for the top job are Ashraf Ghani , the former finance minister , and Abdullah Abdullah , the ex - foreign minister .
A coalition of Karzai 's critics is likely to be required to be strong enough to oust him .
Obama has appointed Richard Holbrooke as special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , underscoring the importance he attaches to the two countries , which are home to the Taliban and the base for al - Qaida .
Long - term US aims are unclear after the defence secretary , Robert Gates , this week ruled out nation - building as a goal .
"" Afghanistan is the fourth or fifth poorest country in the world , "" Gates said in testimony before the US Senate .
"" If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of Central Asian Valhalla over there , we will lose , because nobody in the world has that kind of time , patience or money . """
2009-02-03,"David Miliband is to discuss the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan with Hillary Clinton in Washington today .
Miliband will become the first foreign minister to hold face - to - face talks with Clinton since she became US secretary of state .
The US is conducting a review of its Afghanistan policy against a background of growing disillusionment with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , whose government is riddled with corruption and who has failed to extend government control much beyond Kabul .
The US may ask the UK to provide more troops for Afghanistan .
Barack Obama spoke repeatedly on the election campaign trail of a need to secure the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan , at present used as a safe haven by the Taliban and al - Qaida .
The state department said on Monday that Miliband and Clinton would also discuss Iran and the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Clinton , who was sworn in as secretary of state on Monday , has spoken by phone to her counterparts around the world , including several times with Miliband .
Diplomats have battled over who would be first into Washington to see the new administration , so the Foreign Office will regard it as a coup that it was Miliband .
Obama 's first call to a European leader was to Gordon Brown .
After meeting Miliband , Clinton is to see the German foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier ."
2009-02-16,"It is too early to say that Afghanistan has been a failure , but not too early to say that it has not been a success .
The government of Hamid Karzai is corrupt , muddled , and weak .
It is losing authority both in the Pashtun regions of the country , where most of the armed opposition to the Kabul authorities and the coalition forces is to be found , and in the still relatively peaceful non - Pashtun areas .
Drugs drive the economy , not the agricultural and industrial projects which donors agreed to fund in the confident days after the Taliban were overthrown in 2001 .
Some of the aid which Afghanistan was promised has never been delivered , and some of what has been delivered has been wasted .
The unity of the Nato forces tasked to defeat or at least contain the Taliban is a sham .
Most contingents lurk in uncontested parts of the country , allowing their governments to demonstrate support for the United States without paying any real price , either in casualties or cash .
For those more seriously committed , the blood price is potentially high , as President Nicolas Sarkozy discovered when newly arrived French troops were cut down in ambush last year .
The money price is also high , as recent British figures indicate .
Two and half billion pounds is a lot of money to find in a struggling economy at a time of recession .
The tactics employed by American forces , and depended upon by most of their Nato allies , are open to moral question , particularly the use of an air arm that too often seems unable to distinguish between insurgents gathering for an attack and ordinary people gathering for a wedding .
To make matters worse , the crisis has expanded across frontiers .
It is no longer just a question of al - Qaida and the Taliban finding sanctuary in Pakistani territory , but of the erosion of Islamabad 's control of the tribal areas and the possible defeat , or at least the retreat , of Pakistani armed forces in their own country .
The geopolitical context has also changed .
Attacks on American supply lines through Pakistan make routes through Central Asia more important just at the moment when Russia has squeezed the Americans out of their base in Kyrgyzstan .
A gracious announcement by Sergei Lavrov , the Russian foreign minister , that US supplies will be able to move through Russian territory if the relationship between Moscow and the Nato countries improves carries more than a hint of veto .
Dennis Blair , the new director of national intelligence in the United States , was only reflecting the general mood when he described the outlook in both Afghanistan and Pakistan last week as dispiriting .
It is one of the toughest parts of President Obama 's difficult inheritance .
Neither General David Petraeus , the smart soldier who now heads US central command , nor Richard Holbrooke , Obama 's very able special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , have denied those difficulties .
Holbrooke crafted an imperfect but necessary peace deal for Bosnia at Dayton , while Petraeus turned round a deteriorating security situation in Iraq .
But they have both made a point of saying that the successes upon which their reputations have been built can hardly be simply replicated in their new area of responsibility .
As with Iraq , to present the problem just as one of whether to stay or leave is distorting .
It is the manner of staying or leaving , indeed of both , which matters .
The diplomatic effort must be to defuse the antagonisms which complicate the search for solutions , whether they are between Iran and the US , Russia and the US , or Pakistan and India .
In the affected countries themselves , the way forward is through more modest ambitions , more discriminating military operations , more openness to negotiations , and a strategy which strives to create the conditions for withdrawal while ruling out a panicky dash for the exit ."
2009-02-16,"Washington has agreed to a request from the Afghan government to take part in its overhaul of policy on Afghanistan and Pakistan , as US president Barack Obama seeks a way out of the growing violence that has hit the two key US allies .
The move looked like a thawing of relations between Washington and Kabul , following the visit of US special envoy Richard Holbrooke .
Obama 's presidency had so far been marked by a distancing of relations with Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai , who was backed by the Bush administration and who has been accused of running a weak and corrupt state .
Karzai said he was "" very , very thankful that President Obama has accepted the proposal of Afghanistan joining a strategic review of the war against terrorism "" .
Holbrooke said at a press conference with Karzai that he carried a personal message from President Obama , "" a message of support for the people of Afghanistan and the democratically elected government . ""
With presidential elections due in August , many have speculated Washington will favour an alternative candidate to Karzai .
Obama has so far not telephoned him as he has other allied leaders .
A separate agreement was also hailed by Karzai , which will see more Afghan army input into operations by international forces .
It signifies an attempt to reduce civilian casualties and night - time raids .
Holbrooke also went to Pakistan on his "" listening "" trip of the region , where Islamabad too successfully pressed for inclusion in Washington 's review .
The new policy has to be in place by April , in time for a Nato summit where the US will try to convince European nations to contribute more troops to Afghanistan .
The Pakistani government will send a convoy to Washington next month , while its powerful army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , will make a separate trip .
Islamabad believes that the Karzai regime is close to its arch - enemy India and it will be pressing Washington for more Pakistan - friendly government in Afghanistan .
Obama is concerned about the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan and the Taliban and al - Qaeda "" safe havens "" across the border in Pakistan .
Ex - CIA officer Bruce Riedel has been appointed to head the review of policy towards the two nations ."
2009-02-27,"Who will be the next president of Afghanistan ?
It is a question of intense interest to the foreigners , and especially the Americans , who have presided over the country 's destiny since late 2001 .
Yet it is symptomatic of the condition to which the west 's domineering ways have reduced the country that Afghans themselves scarcely care whether or not Hamid Karzai wins a second term .
Their initial enthusiasm for democratic change has long given way to a weary assumption that everything is going to be fixed by outsiders and that whoever is nominally in charge will have to acquiesce in wrong - headed policies imposed by the United States .
It is typical that the recent spate of Afghan political manoeuvring was set off not by any internal development , but by the change of administration in the US and the appointment of new American envoys to the region .
The Obama administration seems to have already made up its mind that Mr Karzai is part of the problem and must go .
It was agreed last year that presidential elections - due , according to the constitution , in March or April - would have to be postponed until August because the conditions for a safe and valid vote could not be assured in the spring .
The assumption was that Mr Karzai would carry on as president for the interim period , but now he faces a demand that he step down and let a caretaker government take control .
The barely concealed intention is to deprive him of the advantages of incumbency in the election .
He is now thought to be considering calling the election at the earlier date .
Presumably his hope is to confound and confuse his opponents and put the Americans on the spot .
It is true that Mr Karzai is no longer the leader Afghanistan needs .
He tolerates corruption and has many weaknesses .
Yet what has really undermined him has been the failure of America and of the other coalition states to provide him with the means to remake his country .
When troops were needed in the early stage of his presidency to create secure conditions , at a time when it would have been relatively easy to do so , they were not sent .
When aid was needed to bring employment and restore economic life , it did not arrive .
When it was obvious that air strikes were killing innocent people in unacceptable numbers , he could only protest .
And when it became clear that negotiations with the insurgents were an essential part of any sensible strategy , the Americans stood in the way .
Among the contenders to succeed Mr Karzai , there are some who impress , notably Ashraf Ghani , a former finance minister .
But a new president will not be a solution to anything unless he gets the support and the freedom to manoeuvre which Mr Karzai was denied ."
2009-03-01,"Opposition politicians in Afghanistan have accused the president , Hamid Karzai , of constitutional brinkmanship that threatens to turn Afghanistan into "" a new Zimbabwe "" after he called for a snap presidential election to be held in April .
Karzai yesterday called for the poll to be held before 21 April , despite the country 's independent election commission ( IEC ) warning that millions of voters would be disenfranchised by the insurgency in the country 's south and snow - clogged roads in the mountainous north .
The Barack Obama administration – already believed to be losing patience with Karzai 's government – formally lodged its disapproval , saying the election should take place on 21 August , the date set by the IEC .
However , the harshest criticism came from Ashraf Ghani , a former finance minister regarded as one of Karzai 's most formidable opponents .
"" A very dangerous first step has been taken that , if it 's not checked , could lead us to the very unfortunate situation of Kenya or Zimbabwe , "" Ghani said .
"" This is a very perilous position that we have to avoid . ""
The former World Bank official , who published a book on failed states last year , said the two African countries became troubled after "" laws were violated and checks and balances were n't insisted upon "" .
Karzai 's announcement prompted frantic political activity in Kabul , with opposition groups scrambling to pick their candidates .
Ghani publicly declared his intention of running for the first time on local television , while Mirwais Yasini , the deputy speaker of the Afghan lower house , tipped as a potential election winner , yesterday told the Guardian he also intended to run .
Most officials in Kabul are still working on the assumption that early elections are not possible .
One UN official said that although the organisation had been conducting "" scenario planning "" in recent days , it would be impossible to even arrange ballot papers on time .
Most of the extra Nato troops heading for Afghanistan to help improve security conditions will not arrive by April .
Karzai 's defence minister , Abdul Rahim Wardak , told a conference in Washington last Thursday that Taliban violence made an April poll impossible .
One election official involved in the months of planning already completed said an early presidential poll could be achieved , but said the result "" would be open to too many flaws "" .
The conventional diplomatic wisdom in Kabul is that Karzai does not expect to fight an early election but wants to wrongfoot his opponents , who have demanded that he stands down on 21 May , when the constitution demands .
There is huge constitutional uncertainty , however , about should who run the country until fresh elections can be held .
Karzai wants to remain in power , but some opposition parties have demanded a caretaker president should take over , particularly if he – as expected – stands as a candidate for re - election .
Ghani said Karzai should be allowed to stay in power but should be stripped of most of his executive powers to deny him an electoral advantage ."
2009-03-08,"Afghanistan 's president Hamid Karzai has agreed to postpone the country 's presidential elections from April to 20 August after bowing to a ruling by the country 's independent election commission .
The commission voted to delay the election following security and logistical problems .
Karzai 's term in office runs out on 21 May , but he has rejected an opposition demand that an interim administration run the country between that date and the election , saying there is no such provision in the constitution ."
2009-03-08,"Barack Obama would welcome talks with moderate elements of the Taliban because the US is not winning the war in Afghanistan .
In an interview with today 's New York Times , the president acknowledged that a reconciliation process might be needed and that his administration would consider reaching out to moderates in a similar way to that used with Sunni militias in Iraq .
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , welcomed Obama 's call saying it "" was good news because this has been the stand of the Afghan government "" .
Asked in the interview if the US was winning the war in Afghanistan , Obama said "" no "" .
The situation in Afghanistan was more complicated than the challenges the American military faced in Iraq but the strategies used by General David Petraeus in Iraq would be mirrored .
There , US troops were able to persuade Sunni Muslim insurgents to cooperate because they had been alienated by the tactics of al - Qaida terrorists .
"" If you talk to General Petraeus , I think he would argue that part of the success in Iraq involved reaching out to people that we would consider to be Islamic fundamentalists , but who were willing to work with us because they had been completely alienated by the tactics of al - Qaida in Iraq , "" Obama said .
"" The situation in Afghanistan is , if anything , more complex .
You have a less governed region , a history of fierce independence among tribes .
Those tribes are multiple and sometimes operate at cross purposes , and so figuring all that out is going to be much more of a challenge .
"" Obama also refused to rule out American operatives seizing terrorists in other countries , even without that country 's permission .
"" There could be situations – and I emphasise ' could be ' because we have n't made a determination yet –
where , let 's say that we have a well - known al - Qaida operative that does n't surface very often , appears in a third country with whom we do n't have an extradition relationship or would not be willing to prosecute , but we think is a very dangerous person , "" he said .
"" I think we still have to think about how do we deal with that kind of scenario .
"" America "" did not torture "" , said the president , adding : "" We ultimately provide anybody that we 're detaining an opportunity through habeas corpus to answer to charges . ""
Karzai , addressing a gymnasium full of Afghan women to mark International Women 's Day , warned that there were Taliban fighters beyond reconciliation but said talks should go forward "" with those who are afraid to come back to their country , or who feel they have no choice but to stay with the Taliban for various reasons .
They are welcome . ""
Last month Obama ordered 17,000 more US troops to Afghanistan to bolster the record 38,000 already in the country .
He has promised to increase the US focus on Afghanistan and away from Iraq , as the US begins to draw down its forces there .
In the latest violence , a roadside blast killed a Nato service member and wounded two US coalition members in eastern Afghanistan today .
The alliance did not disclose the troops ' nationalities or the exact location of the attack , but the majority of troops in eastern Afghanistan are American .
Another roadside blast in central Ghazni province hit a police vehicle , killing six policemen and wounding another six officers .
Late on Friday , a joint Afghan - coalition patrol killed two Afghan policemenwho had opened fire on their team in north - eastern Kapisa province .
The deaths continue an upward spike in violence that has spread throughout Afghanistan over the past three years , even as Obama 's administration tries to devise a new way of dealing with the Afghan war ."
2009-03-09,"Barack Obama 's call for "" moderate "" Taliban members to be brought in from the cold met with scepticism yesterday from leading Afghan opposition figures , who warned that co - opting fighters would fail as long as Hamid Karzai 's government appeared weak and corrupt .
Repeating a successful strategy in Iraq , Obama floated the idea of appealing to Taliban adherents who are alienated by the extremism of al - Qaida fighters and might be prepared to switch sides .
"" Part of the success in Iraq involved reaching out to people that we would consider to be Islamic fundamentalists but who were willing to work with us because they had been completely alienated by the tactics of al - Qaida in Iraq , "" Obama said in an interview published yesterday . ""
There may be some comparable opportunities in Afghanistan and the Pakistani region . ""
But opposition figures warned that insurgents groups rarely ceded ground when they thought they were winning .
Ashraf Ghani , a former Afghanistan finance minister , who is to stand as presidential candiate in the elections in August , said : "" I do n't know of a single peace process that has been successfully negotiated from a position of weakness or stalemate . ""
A Taliban spokesman , who said that the US president 's overture was a sign of weakness , poured cold water on the notion that "" moderate "" fighters could be easily turned .
Qari Yusuf Ahmadi , a Taliban spokesman contacted by telephone , said : "" They say they want to speak to moderate Taliban but they will not be able to find such people because we are united around the aim of fighting for freedom and bringing an Islamic system to Afghanistan . ""
He added that Obama 's comments were a reflection of the fact that the Americans had "" become tired and worried "" .
In his interview Obama conceded that the situation in Afghanistan was far more complex than in Iraq .
His overture is not thought to involve a comprehensive peace negotation with the Taliban leadership but rather a chance to explore opportunities at the local level to encourage insurgents to move to the government 's side .
Haroun Mir , a political analyst and former adviser to the mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud , said that even small - time insurgents would not be persuaded to lay down arms at a time when the Taliban was scenting victory over the Afghan government and its foreign backers .
"" Reconciliation was a great idea in 2003 or 2004 , when the government had the upper hand , but now things are all going the Taliban 's way .
They are at the edge of Kabul and they have no incentive to join the government 's side . ""
Nonetheless Obama 's remarks represent a shift in official US attitudes towards the Islamic fundamentalist movement which gave sanctuary to al - Qaida in the years running up to 9/11 .
Until recently US officials worried that the American public would not stomach such overtures .
Karzai , Afghanistan 's president , welcomed Obama 's comments as "" good news "" , saying they represented "" approval of our previous stance , and we accept and praise it "" .
But Karzai has often shown more interest in making grand peace overtures to the senior leadership of the Taliban , even promising Mullah Omar , the Afghanistan ruler from 1996 until the American invasion , protection from US arrest if he returned to Afghanistan .
Little has been done , though , to persuade small - time insurgents to swap sides .
A commission charged with reconciliation has been poorly monitored , according to western diplomats , with no record kept on the insurgents afterwards .
A British plan attempted to push for progress with Taliban commanders in Helmand , in 2007 , by setting up secret "" retraining "" camps to provide insurgents with inducements to swap sides .
But Karzai reacted furiously , expelling two foreign diplomats .
Despite Obama 's enthusiasm for a renewed push , progress is likely to remain slow in a country where public attitudes towards the Taliban often run along regional and racial lines .
However , some western officials , including French defence minister Hervé Morin , believe the coming presidential election campaign could help stimulate talks between insurgents and the government .
Who are they ?
What is the Taliban ?
A set of Islamist militant groups based along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
While all the groups recognise the authority of Mullah Omar , they have a high degree of independence .
Can there be a "" moderate "" Talib ?
Taliban have been described as extremist , moderate , hardcore , ideological , reconcilable and non - reconcilable .
Others - "" tier three "" in military jargon - are little more than gangsters using the name to pursue local disputes .
Could they be made to swap sides ?
Rebels have been persuaded to swap sides in conflicts from Malaya to Algeria .
The problem is while the Pashtun ethnic group , from which the Taliban draws most of its support , may forgive their repentant sons , the Tajiks , Uzbeks and Hazara of the north who suffered most under Taliban rule are less willing to accept any compromises ."
2009-03-18,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , today warned the international community not to meddle in the government of his country as it prepares to go to the polls for presidential elections this summer .
Speaking alongside the Nato secretary general , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , at a news conference in Kabul , Karzai said the government 's foreign partners should respect his country 's independence . ""
Afghanistan … will never be a puppet state , "" he said .
The president faces a battle for re - election in August , with Afghanistan embroiled in a Taliban - led insurgency and his government being criticised by the US and other nations as inefficient and corrupt .
As the new US administration shifts the focus from Iraq to Afghanistan , the US president , Barack Obama , has also ordered a review of strategy in the region .
The results of the review are expected to be revealed later this month .
In response to the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan , Obama has sent thousands of extra troops to the country 's south – the Taliban 's heartland – and urged Nato allies to do more .
Karzai said he appreciated the work the US and other members of the international community have done so far in reconstructing the country and fighting against terrorism .
The Afghan president claimed some in the international community were proposing that the power of the central government should be weakened , without explaining which countries were allegedly behind the idea .
"" That is not their job , "" he added .
"" The issue of governance and the creation of [ a mechanism for ] good governance is the work of the Afghan people . ""
His comments came in response to a question from an Afghan journalist who suggested that international forces operating in the provinces were trying to directly support local leaders .
Zalmay Khalilzad , a former US ambassador to the UN , Afghanistan and Iraq , recently told the New York Times he had warned the Obama administration in January that any attempts to focus on local areas at the expense of the central government risked being "" regarded as hostile policy "" .
"" Some will regard it as an effort to break up the Afghan state , "" Khalilzad , an Afghan - American , said .
Karzai said the international community could only do its job with the Afghan people 's support . ""
With Afghanistan , there should be respect and honour –
and we will also respect and honour our allies , "" he said .
"" Afghanistan now is the owner of its land , and nobody can disrupt our country . ""
Earlier today , a roadside blast in the capital , Kabul , hit a civilian vehicle , wounding three people .
The explosion happened as the vehicle passed a petrol station in western Kabul , the interior ministry said .
Taliban militants regularly use roadside bombs to attack Afghan and foreign troops , but the majority of victims are civilians ."
2009-03-22,"The US and its European allies are ­preparing to plant a high - profile figure in the heart of the Kabul government in a direct challenge to the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , the Guardian has learned .
The creation of a new chief executive or prime ministerial role is aimed at bypassing Karzai .
In a further dilution of his power , it is proposed that money be diverted from the Kabul government to the provinces .
Many US and European officials have become disillusioned with the extent of the corruption and incompetence in the Karzai government , but most now believe there are no credible alternatives , and predict the Afghan president will win re - election in August .
A revised role for Karzai has emerged from the White House review of Afghanistan and Pakistan ordered by Barack Obama when he became president .
It isto be unveiled at a special conference on Afghanistan at The Hague on March 31 .
As well as watering down Karzai 's personal authority by installing a senior official at the president 's side capable of playing a more efficient executive role , the US and Europeans are seeking to channel resources to the provinces rather than to central government in Kabul .
A diplomat with knowledge of the review said : "" Karzai is not delivering .
If we are going to support his government , it has to be run properly to ensure the levels of corruption decrease , not increase .
The levels of corruption are frightening . ""
Another diplomat said alternatives to Karzai had been explored and discarded : "" No one could be sure that someone else would not turn out to be 10 times worse .
It is not a great position . ""
The idea of a more dependable figure working alongside Karzai is one of the proposals to emerge from the White House review , completed last week .
Obama , locked away at the presidental retreat Camp David , was due to make a final decision this weekend .
Obama is expected to focus in public on overall strategy rather than the details , and , given its sensitivity , to skate over ­Karzai 's new role .
The main recommendation is for the Afghanistan objectives to be scaled back , and for Obama to sell the war to the US public as one to ensure the country can not again be a base for al - Qaida and the Taliban , rather than the more ambitious aim of the Bush administration of trying to create a European - style democracy in Central Asia .
Other recommendations include : increasing the number of Afghan troops from 65,000 to 230,000 as well as expanding the 80,000-strong police force ; ­sending more US and European civilians to build up Afghanistan 's infrastructure ; and increased aid to Pakistan as part of a policy of trying to persuade it to tackle al - Qaida and Taliban elements .
The proposal for an alternative chief executive , which originated with the US , is backed by Europeans .
"" There needs to be a deconcentration of power , "" said one senior European official .
"" We need someone next to Karzai , a sort of chief executive , who can get things done , who will be reliable for us and accountable to the Afghan people . ""
Money and power will flow less to the ministries in Kabul and far more to the officials who run Afghanistan outside the capital – the 34 provincial governors and 396 district governors .
"" The point on which we insist is that the time is now for a new division of responsibilities , between central power and local power , "" the senior European official said .
No names have emerged for the new role but the US holds in high regard the reformist interior minister appointed in October , Mohammed Hanif Atmar .
The risk for the US is that the imposition of a technocrat alongside Karzai would be viewed as colonialism , even though that figure would be an Afghan .
Karzai declared his intention last week to resist a dilution of his power .
Last week he accused an unnamed foreign government of trying to weaken central government in Kabul .
"" That is not their job , "" the Afghan president said .
"" Afghanistan will never be a puppet state . ""
The UK government has since 2007 advocated dropping plans to turn Afghanistan into a model , European - style state .
Richard Holbrooke , the US envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , who will implement the new policy , said it would represent a "" vastly restructured effort "" .
At the weekend in Brussels , he was scathing about the Bush administration 's conduct of the counter - insurgency . ""
The failures in the civilian side ... are so enormous we can at least hope that if we get our act together ... we can do a lot better , "" he said ."
2009-03-23,
2009-03-23,"Four years ago Hamid Karzai , the softly spoken , well - dressed president of Afghanistan , was untouchable .
In the wake of the US - engineered toppling of the Taliban regime , Karzai was seen by the west as the only man who could make something out of a country wrecked by decades of war .
A Pashtun and a member of the same tribe as the old royal family , Karzai was thought to be cut from the right cloth to lead a famously fissiparous country .
He was a man the west could do business with : although he initially backed the Taliban , he had shunned the extreme mujahideen groups that fought the Soviets in the 1980s and which gave rise to some of the militant groups causing havoc today .
With his impeccable English , Karzai wowed the international community , not least Tom Ford , then of Gucci , who famously said the president 's get - up of robes and karakul sheepskin hat made him the "" chic - est man on the planet "" .
Today , the Karzai backlash is in full swing , from the US and European leaders threatening to undermine his position to senior Afghan figures in Kabul . ""
He was never the right choice , "" Ashraf Ghani , a former finance minister , said .
"" I worked with him and never thought he should have been more than a junior minister . ""
Opinion is divided on when things started to go so wrong for the 51-year - old leader .
Hedayat Amin Arsala , a former vice - president who is still a senior minister , said Karzai 's original sin was to co - operate with the reviled warlords when he became leader of Afghanistan 's interim government in early 2002 .
These regional militia leaders were revered as heroes of the jihad against the Soviet Union , but after the Russians left they became hate figures for lawlessness and corruption .
Arsala , a former close ally of Karzai , is one of about a dozen Afghan politicians planning to stand against him in the presidential election in August .
Sitting in the magnificent surroundings of his office , where the Afghan cabinet used to meet in the nineteenth century , he said he was standing more in sorrow than anger . ""
For the last three years we have had insecurity and corruption .
Unless we change this direction substantially and very energetically under a new leader then I think we are going to be in trouble . ""
Blame Karzai 's defenders say it is unfair to blame all of Afghanistan 's current troubles on a single individual who was denied the resources he needed from the start . ""
In the early days the international community did not have any coherent strategy and the question of governance was never raised , "" said Jawed Ludin , Afghanistan 's ambassador to Norway and Karzai 's former chief of staff .
"" In the beginning Donald Rumsfeld barged in with a purely military strategy .
They did nothing to stop drug production and they hired militias who perpetuated a lot of atrocities . ""
But it is hard to find anyone who can explain Karzai 's apparent inability to crack down on the rampant corruption that is eating at the heart of the Afghan state .
According to Transparency International 's corruption index , Afghanistan slipped from being perceived as the 117th least corrupt government in the world in 2005 to 176th in 2008 - four places from the absolute bottom .
Last year Thomas Schweich , one of George Bush 's top counter - narcotics officials , accused Karzai himself of trying to thwart US efforts to crack down on poppy cultivation and "" protecting drug lords and narco - farmers "" involved in the £ 2.8bn a year industry .
Rumours have abounded for years about some of Karzai 's brothers , most notably Ahmed Wali Karzai , the head of the provincial council in Kandahar .
Last year the New York Times quoted White House officials saying Ahmed Wali was involved in drug trafficking - an allegation he denies .
More recently , public attention has focused on Mahmoud Karzai , a man who spent most of his life in political exile in the US running restaurants .
Despite his relatively limited business experience , in the last seven years he has become one of Afghanistan 's leading tycoons , with shares in the country 's biggest bank , property developments , and control of one of the country 's biggest industrial assets , a cement plant north of Kabul .
Mismanagement
Some close observers say the president is just too nice to get to grips with the cronies that surround him . ""
The trouble is he does n't like confronting people or saying things to people that they do n't want to hear , "" said Francesc Vendrell , the former European Union special representative in Kabul , who first met Karzai in 2000 .
"" It was a constant battle to persuade him to get rid of ministers or governors who were corrupt or incompetent . ""
In the view of one western diplomat : "" He 's a poet for Christ 's sake - what do you expect ?
"" Karzai was once found by a western diplomat poring over a collection of Philip Larkin poems .
Some credit his poetry as the source of ability to hold an audience , whether in English , Dari or Pashtu .
But many technocrats who plan to stand against him in August say his pre-2001 career as a junior official in a moderate anti - Soviet resistance group did not give him the management skills necessary to run a modern state . ""
Unlike his brothers he could n't even run a two - room restaurant , "" said Ashraf Ghani , who once served as Karzai 's finance minister and is running against him .
Anwar ul - Haq Ahadi , another former finance minister and presidential candidate , said Karzai had "" absolutely no capacity for critical thinking "" .
"" He does not prepare for meetings .
He does not do background reading , he does not prepare questions .
Cabinet meetings are very unproductive .
He just takes a position and then expects it to be followed .
"" One of Karzai 's aides , speaking privately , said the presidential office was chaotic , with minutes of meetings rarely kept and copies of presidential speeches lost .
Decisions are made "" on the hoof "" with an inner circle of "" yes men "" .
Mohammad Amin Farhang , who until late last year was commerce minister , said the president often appoints unsuitable provincial governors and government officials to retain the support of warlords . ""
Without asking me he appointed a department head in my ministry who was totally incompetent .
It was a political deal between [ Karzai ] and a jihadi leader and it created lots of problems . ""
Helena Malikyar first met him in the late 1990s at meetings held in Rome by exiled Afghan politicians . ""
He never really took the lead and would be very quiet for long periods .
Whenever there was a suggestion with which he disagreed he would n't say anything to counter it , "" she recalled .
The president 's shortcomings have not been helped by the wall of security surrounding the presidential palace in Kabul , largely shutting him off from the realities of Afghan daily life .
Dr Abdullah Abdullah , a former foreign minister and another candidate , said : "" With all the ceremonies , protocol and troops marching around , he soon was not walking on the ground .
Gradually he came to view that he deserved it , and he was the only person who could run the country . ""
A common analysis of Karzai 's management style is that of a traditional tribal elder who , according to a western diplomat , "" wants to satisfy everyone .
They do n't want to alienate anyone because this is the tradition of tribal jirgas . ""
But Ahmed Wali Massoud , a former senior member of Karzai 's early government and brother of the current vice - president , does not accept the analysis . ""
Tribal leaders keep promises .
They promote the interests of the tribe , but Karzai does it for his own ego . ""
Massoud believes Karzai is a man who has taken too many lessons in statecraft from the British colonial experience . ""
He once said to me , ' The only way to rule this country is divide and rule !
Divide and rule ! '
He repeated it over and over . ""
Washington Abdullah said Karzai had used this ploy by warning that if the US failed to provide military aircraft , he would seek assistance from "" the other place "" , which was widely interpreted as meaning Russia .
It is the increasingly negative view from Washington that is most dangerous for Karzai 's political survival . ""
Most Afghans are extremely pragmatic and they equate foreign support with strength , "" said Ludin , the ambassador to Norway .
"" If they know the Americans are not with you , you are not a serious candidate . ""
Karzai 's all - important relationship with the Democrat leadership in Washington turned sour long before Barack Obama was elected .
In February 2008 Joseph Biden , then a senator , paid a visit to Kabul .
Over a meal at the palace , Biden grew increasingly exasperated at Karzai 's refusal to accept that his government was mired in corruption .
The future US vice - president eventually stalked out early , declaring : "" This meeting is over . ""
Obama did not even bother to phone his opposite number until four weeks after his inauguration , and cancelled the regular video conferences that Bush was fond of having with Karzai .
The two leaders reportedly got on well , partly because they had the same "" gutsy , informal way of doing business "" , according to Ludin , who recalled Karzai 's habit of jumping up in meetings to pour cups of tea for even the most junior officials .
Bush also "" did n't want to admit they had a problem in Afghanistan , when things were going so wrong in Iraq "" , according to one US diplomat .
Now Karzai has to deal with Richard Holbrooke , Obama 's special envoy tasked with turning around the unfolding crises in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Holbrooke clearly thinks Karzai is part of the problem .
In remarks made before his appointment he said his government was "" weak ; it is corrupt ; it has a very thin leadership veneer ; it is internally divided ; it has never arrested any major drug lords "" .
But it is on the issue of civilian casualties that Karzai 's relationship with his western backers has hit rock bottom .
In September he had a furious row with the normally supportive Bush administration after he accused US forces of massacring more than 90 civilians , including women and children , in Azizabad .
According to one of Karzai 's close aides , Condoleezza Rice gave Karzai a verbal lashing over the incident during a telephone conversation .
She warned the president that if he continued to criticise the US , "" we will no longer co - operate with you "" .
Karzai says he has lost popularity in Washington because of his willingness to talk out on the issue .
"" I was a lovely man when I was keeping quiet .
I 'm a nasty man , a no - good leader when I began to speak , "" he complained recently .
Holding on Other observers say Karzai is warning the US to back off .
One of his top aides warned the recently departed UK ambassador of the dangers of not supporting Karzai , only for him to win anyway .
And that , despite his unpopularity , still looks like the most likely outcome .
Karzai enjoys both the advantages of incumbency and a face recognised across the country in an election where most voters are unable to read names on the ballot .
And as long as he remains president , he has the power to reward supporters with government positions who can be expected to campaign for him in far - flung parts of the country .
The opposition can only cash in on the national ill - will towards the president if most of them agree not to stand so the anti - Karzai vote would not be split .
"" There are no other candidates who are obviously better , "" one western diplomat said .
"" Some might be better administrators but they probably wo n't be better communicators . ""
Haroun Mir , director of the Centre for Research and Policy Studies in Kabul , fears the international community will give up on Afghanistan unless things change . ""
With President Karzai we can not hope for change : it will be another five years of nepotism , corruption and mismanagement of funds and dysfunctional government . ""
Performance issues The president of Afghanistan is known for making maximum use of his far - reaching executive powers .
To the frustration of western diplomats , Hamid Karzai is in the habit of getting involved in the appointment of junior officials and relatively lowly governors of some of the country 's 360 or so districts , rather than spending his time on bigger issues .
But while Afghanistan 's highly centralised system allows for presidential micro - management it is not very good at delivering services to ordinary Afghans .
Resource - starved ministries in Kabul and a lack of qualified bureaucrats can prevent projects in far - flung parts of the country ever getting off the ground .
The president 's powers in relation to parliament have never been settled and Karzai has had several battles with the country 's elected politicians .
Yunus Qanooni , the speaker of parliament 's lower house , has led calls for the constitution to be changed to create a strong prime ministerial role with executive powers .

2009-03-28,"The leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan today praised the new US strategy for dealing with growing violence in their countries , with the Afghan president saying it was "" better than we were expecting "" and his Pakistani counterpart calling it a "" positive change "" .
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , welcomed increased civil and military aid to his country .
He highlighted a plan for reconciliation with moderate elements of the Taliban as the most important initiative in the strategy unveiled by Barack Obama yesterday .
He also approved of the US president 's focus on countering militant sanctuaries in neighbouring Pakistan .
"" This is better than we were expecting , as a matter of fact , "" Karzai said .

Karzai has long championed the idea of reconciliation with the Taliban as a key way to dampen down the insurgency in Afghanistan .
The Bush administration generally opposed the idea , but Obama yesterday stressed engagement with more moderate elements . ""
In a country with extreme poverty that has been at war for decades , there will also be no peace without reconciliation among former enemies , "" Obama said .
The reconciliation proposal is the most novel part of the new plan , which is focused mostly on increasing the scale of ongoing initiatives .
It promises 4,000 additional troops to train the Afghan army , hundreds more civilian specialists to help Afghanistan rebuild and $ 1.5bn in annual civilian aid to Pakistan for the next five years . ""
In this strategy , the most important issue is Taliban reconciliation and peace talks as President Obama mentioned in his speech , "" Karzai said .
Obama focused on reaching out to Taliban militants who have chosen to fight because they need the money or were coerced by others .
However , he said there is "" an uncompromising core of the Taliban "" that must be met with force and defeated .
The plan singles out Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar and other top members .
The issue of who is targeted for reconciliation could become a source of friction between the US and Afghanistan because Karzai has signaled a greater willingness to talk to hardcore militants - even extending an offer to the Taliban leader .
Militant sanctuaries in Pakistan will be a key focus as the US administration attempts to disrupt and defeat al - Qaida and its allies , who have made a comeback following the fall of the Taliban in 2001 .
US - led forces toppled the Taliban government , but many of the militants fled south and east into Pakistan where they have been launching cross - border attacks against Afghan and international forces alongside al - Qaida .
The US and Afghanistan have repeatedly urged Pakistan to crack down on militants in its territory .
The Pakistani government has pledged to do so , but many Afghan and western officials suspect officers within the country 's spy agency of supporting the Taliban , which Pakistan helped bring to power in Afghanistan in the 1990s ."
2009-03-28,"The policy overhaul announced by Barack Obama yesterday received a warm welcome from the Afghan government , diplomats and aid workers , many of whom have lobbied for years for a change of strategy .
What won most plaudits among ordinary Afghans was Obama 's acceptance that Taliban safe havens in Pakistan are largely responsible for the deteriorating situation in the country .
Although Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , has long campaigned on the issue , he has often struggled to persuade his western backers to take a tough line on Pakistan .
"" This announcement incorporates many of the points of view we have shared with the Americans , "" Karzai 's spokesman said .
"" We particularly welcome the recognition that the Afghanistan problem will have to be addressed in a regional context .
And we welcome the realisation that the Taliban and al - Qaida threat emanates from Pakistan . ""
But Nama Khan , a tribal elder from Kunar province who lives in Kabul , said : "" It 's good that they want to talk to the Taliban and that they are going to tackle the centre of this problem , which is Pakistan .
But it 's too late .
The world community knew about this years ago and they did nothing . ""
The full white paper by the Interagency Policy Group that drew up the new strategy , published at the same time as Obama 's speech , also called for low - level Taliban fighters to be persuaded to swap sides .
A national network of offices will be set up to do the job .
Michael Semple , the former deputy EU special representative in Kabul , expelled from Afghanistan in 2008 for his reconciliation attempts in Helmand , said the Obama strategy was an "" important step forward "" and that recent contacts with the Taliban indicated "" some willingness for political accommodation "" .
But he warned that the Americans would have to tackle corruption in the Afghan government , which he said drives people into the arms of the Taliban . ""
The overall success of the strategy will depend on whether the new administration really does remove the rose - tinted glasses with which the Bush administration tended to view its partners in Afghanistan .
"" Members of the aid community also welcomed the policy group 's acceptance of their long - standing criticism that the US system of delivering aid was wasteful , with too much money skimmed off by US companies contracted to projects ."
2009-03-30,"Hamid Karzai has been accused of trying to win votes in Afghanistan 's presidential election by backing a law the UN says legalises rape within marriage and bans wives from stepping outside their homes without their husbands ' permission .
The Afghan president signed the law earlier this month , despite condemnation by human rights activists and some MPs that it flouts the constitution 's equal rights provisions .
The final document has not been published , but the law is believed to contain articles that rule women can not leave the house without their husbands ' permission , that they can only seek work , education or visit the doctor with their husbands ' permission , and that they can not refuse their husband sex .
A briefing document prepared by the United Nations Development Fund for Women also warns that the law grants custody of children to fathers and grandfathers only .
Senator Humaira Namati , a member of the upper house of the Afghan parliament , said the law was "" worse than during the Taliban "" .
"" Anyone who spoke out was accused of being against Islam , "" she said .
The Afghan constitution allows for Shias , who are thought to represent about 10 % of the population , to have a separate family law based on traditional Shia jurisprudence .
But the constitution and various international treaties signed by Afghanistan guarantee equal rights for women .
Shinkai Zahine Karokhail , like other female parliamentarians , complained that after an initial deal the law was passed with unprecedented speed and limited debate .
"" They wanted to pass it almost like a secret negotiation , "" she said .
"" There were lots of things that we wanted to change , but they did n't want to discuss it because Karzai wants to please the Shia before the election . ""
Although the ministry of justice confirmed the bill was signed by Karzai at some point this month , there is confusion about the full contents of the final law , which human rights activists have struggled to obtain a copy of .
The justice ministry said the law would not be published until various "" technical problems "" had been ironed out .
After seven years leading Afghanistan , Karzai is increasingly unpopular at home and abroad and the presidential election in August is expected to be extremely closely fought .
A western diplomat said the law represented a "" big tick in the box "" for the powerful council of Shia clerics .
Leaders of the Hazara minority , which is regarded as the most important bloc of swing voters in the election , also demanded the new law .
Ustad Mohammad Akbari , an MP and the leader of a Hazara political party , said the president had supported the law in order to curry favour among the Hazaras .
But he said the law actually protected women 's rights . ""
Men and women have equal rights under Islam but there are differences in the way men and women are created .
Men are stronger and women are a little bit weaker ; even in the west you do not see women working as firefighters . ""
Akbari said the law gave a woman the right to refuse sexual intercourse with her husband if she was unwell or had another reasonable "" excuse "" .
And he said a woman would not be obliged to remain in her house if an emergency forced her to leave without permission .
The international community has so far shied away from publicly questioning such a politically sensitive issue .
"" It is going to be tricky to change because it gets us into territory of being accused of not respecting Afghan culture , which is always difficult , "" a western diplomat in Kabul admitted .
Soraya Sobhrang , the head of women 's affairs at the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , said western silence had been "" disastrous for women 's rights in Afghanistan "" .
"" What the international community has done is really shameful .
If they had got more involved in the process when it was discussed in parliament we could have stopped it .
Because of the election I am not sure we can change it now .
It 's too late for that . ""
But another senior western diplomat said foreign embassies would intervene when the law is finally published .
Some female politicians have taken a more pragmatic stance , saying their fight in parliament 's lower house succeeded in improving the law , including raising the original proposed marriage age of girls from nine to 16 and removing completely provisions for temporary marriages .
"" It 's not really 100 % perfect , but compared to the earlier drafts it 's a huge improvement , "" said Shukria Barakzai , an MP .
"" Before this was passed family issues were decided by customary law , so this is a big improvement . ""
Karzai 's spokesman declined to comment on the new law ."
2009-03-31,"Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , came under intense western pressure yesterday to scrap a new law that the UN said legalised rape within marriage and severely limited the rights of women .
At a conference on Afghanistan in The Hague , Scandinavian foreign ministers publicly challenged the Afghan leader to respond to a report on the new law in yesterday 's Guardian , and the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , was reported to have confronted Karzai on the issue in a private meeting .
At a press conference after the meeting , Clinton made clear US displeasure at the apparent backsliding on women 's rights . ""
This is an area of absolute concern for the United States .
My message is very clear .
Women 's rights are a central part of the foreign policy of the Obama administration , "" she said .
The Guardian reported that Karzai had signed the controversial law last month .
The text has not yet been published but the UN , human rights activists and some Afghan MPs said it included clauses stipulating that women can not refuse to have sex with their husbands , and can only seek work , education or visit the doctor with their husbands ' permission .
International aid officials say the law violates both UN conventions and the Afghan constitution .
It is widely seen as a political ploy by Karzai to win support from conservative Muslims in presidential elections scheduled for August .
Mark Malloch Brown , Britain 's foreign office minister for Africa , Asia and the UN , expressed "" dismay "" over the law 's impact on women 's rights . ""
We are caught in the Catch-22 that the Afghans obviously have the right to write their own laws , "" he said .
"" But there is dismay .
The rights of women was one of the reasons the UK and many in the west threw ourselves into the struggle in Afghanistan .
It matters greatly to us and our public opinion . ""
Malloch Brown did not meet Karzai yesterday , but said "" one can confidently assume "" that it came up in the private bilateral sessions the Afghan leader held with western officials in the course of the day .
Diplomatic sources said later that women 's rights had been one of the subjects of the Clinton - Karzai meeting .
At the Hague conference , instigated at Washington 's request to rally international support for Obama 's new strategy in Afghanistan , Finland 's foreign minister , Alexander Stubb , called on the Karzai government to respond to the Guardian report , a call echoed by Iceland , while Norway also expressed concern over the trend in women 's rights ."
2009-03-31,"Barack Obama denies his government is now running the car industry .
But head of business Dan Roberts says the president effectively removed the head of General Motors , Rick Wagoner , who quit after a meeting in Washington early this morning .

2009-04-05,"Afghanistan is to review legislation which the UN says would legalise rape within marriage after a dramatic reversal from the president , Hamid Karzai , who signed the rules into law last month .
Karzai has bowed to intense international pressure to scrap the law , described by the UN human rights chief in Afghanistan as "" reminiscent of the decrees made by the Taliban regime "" .
It is said to forbid women to refuse to have sex with their husbands and force them to get their spouses ' permission before leaving the house , looking for a job , going to the doctor or receiving education .
Gordon Brown has led the international condemnation of the law , saying today it would be unacceptable for British soldiers to die defending a regime that enacted oppressive legislation of this kind .
The prime minister told Sky News that Nato leaders had attacked the law in the communique issued at the end of the summit in Strasbourg , and that Karzai had told him it would not come into force in the way that it had been reported .
"" I phoned the president immediately about this because anybody who looks at Afghanistan will be worried if we are going to see laws brought in that discriminate against women and put women at risk , "" Brown said .
"" I made it absolutely clear to the president that we could not tolerate that situation .
You can not have British troops fighting , and in some cases dying , to save a democracy where that democracy is infringing human rights . ""
[ Karzai ] responded by saying this law would not be enacted in the way it has been presented . ""
The Afghan president was accused of backing the law to win support from hardliners ahead of the presidential election .
But a western diplomat said Karzai had been damaged by the international criticism of the legislation , which only affects members of the Shia minority , and was "" looking for a face - saving way to drop it "" .
"" Given that it is election season right now plus the problems it would stir up it might be better if it could be buried , "" he said .
Fears have also been raised about the safety of the female parliamentarians who have spoken out on the issue .
Foreign ambassadors met in Kabul today to consider a request to pay for bodyguards to protect them .
On Saturday Karzai rejected international criticism of the law , saying it had been "" misinterpreted "" by the west .
But he promised to send it to the Ministry of Justice for review and amendment if it was found to conflict with the equal rights provisions in Afghanistan 's constitution .
The final version of the law has not been published , although it was enacted in mid - March .
An analysis by the Canadian embassy in Kabul of the version that was sent by parliament to the president says the law contains a number of articles removing the rights of women .
Custody of children , for example , is automatically granted to fathers and grandfathers , and provision is made for minors to marry , although a later amendment set the age of marriage to the same as Afghan civil law .
The most controversial article says that the wife is "" bound to preen for her husband , as and when he desires "" and "" is bound to give a positive response to the sexual desire of her husband "" .
Defenders of the law have pointed out that the legislation was improved by the lower house of parliament , which introduced the concession allowing women to leave their homes without the permission of their husbands if they had a good reason to .
Dr Qasim Hashimzai , deputy minister of justice , said a review process had been set up that would include the United Nations and representatives from a number of diplomatic missions in Kabul , including the European Union , Canada and Holland .
"" We still have time to review it because the law is not yet finalised until it is printed in the official gazette .
Once we get everyone around a table we can see what needs to be done . ""
He did not give a date for when the review might be completed ."
2009-04-29,"The Taliban leadership today promised to meet the US - led surge in foreign forces in Afghanistan with a summer of violence against the beleaguered government of Hamid Karzai .
Mullah Brother Akhund , the second most powerful man in the hardline movement , published a statement on the Taliban website announcing the start of "" Operation Victory "" today , which he said will involve ambushes on security forces and suicide bomb attacks .
"" The targets of these operations will be the military units of the invading forces , diplomatic centres , mobile convoys , high - ranking officials of the puppet administration , members of parliament and personnel of the so - called defence , interior and national security ministries , "" the message said .
A Taliban spokesman reinforced Mullah Akhund 's message by putting calls to a number of media organisations yesterday , including the Guardian .
Zabihullah Mujahid said the promised upsurge in violence was a response to the decision of the US and several other Nato allies to send more troops to Afghanistan to challenge the influence Taliban insurgents who influence over huge swathes of countryside in the south and in the provinces next to Kabul , the capital .
The US is in the process of sending an extra 21,000 troops to buttress the roughly 70,000 foreign troops already there .
Today Australia became the latest US ally to promise extra troops to help improve security in the southern province of Uruzgan in the run up to the Afghan presidential election in August .
A western security official said the statement should be taken seriously as the Taliban have previously lived up to their often bold statements of intent , including their past promises to attack roads and encircle Kabul . ""
They said they would launch operations in the north of Afghanistan this year
and that 's exactly what they have done , "" he said .
"" There is no doubt that they can counter - surge if they want to – if they choose to consolidate themselves in Pakistan . ""
Kabul itself has been enjoying a relative lull in security incidents , although the official said across the country violence levels "" has never been higher "" for this part of the year . ""
In the capital we have seen less of the regularly occurring incidents – instead the insurgents seem to be saving their energies for the less frequent spectaculars .
"" People have a false sense of security at the moment because Kabul is quiet but it 's likely that this summer is going to be particularly appalling in terms of violence . ""
Recent spectaculars have included a commando - style raid by insurgents on ' government buildings in central Kabul ."
2009-05-02,"An influential Afghan governor , Gul Agha Sherzai , who had signalled his intention to run for president , said yesterday he will not , leaving the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , in an increasingly strong position to win re - election .
Sherzai was seen as one of the few possible candidates who could have threatened Karzai in the 20 August election .
Karzai swept to victory in Afghanistan 's 2004 election , although an increase in fighting against Taliban insurgents in recent years and a rising civilian death toll have eroded his standing ."
2009-05-03,"The top UN official in Afghanistan today called for the Taliban to participate in the August presidential election as a way to kick - start a peace process with the militants who are fighting to overthrow the western - backed government in Kabul .
Kai Eide , the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan , said the militants should participate in a campaign that formally starts on Thursday and which looks increasingly likely to be won by Hamid Karzai , the hugely unpopular incumbent . ""
Call it reconciliation , or the peace process , whatever you want , but I believe that the opposition should know that those who want to take part in the election and respect the constitution should have an option to do that , "" Eide said .
Although Taliban spokesmen have said they oppose the election , hopes that some of them might be drawn into the political process have been raised by the lack of attacks on the six - month long voter registration process .
This week is a crucial moment in Afghanistan 's second - ever democratic election , which is costing international donors upwards of $ 300 m ( about £ 200 m ) .
Thursday is the deadline for candidates to make up their minds about standing .
Karzai is expected go in person tomorrow to the independent election commission to submit his papers that also reveal his two vice - presidential candidates .
Western diplomats have been aghast at Karzai 's likely choice of Muhammad Fahim , a former mujahideen leader who blocked efforts to reform the government while serving as defence minister .
Although controversial , Fahim 's selection would suit Karzai 's electoral game plan , as it would help to split the United National Front , the powerful opposition group of former anti - Soviet resistance leaders from the north of the country that has selected the former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah as its candidate .
Meanwhile much of the rest of the opposition to Karzai appears to have crumbled , with a number of the leading candidates who were expected to run against him pulling out of the race .
On Saturday one of the most colourful , a former warlord turned provincial governor called Gul Agha Sherzai , announced that he had changed his mind after holding a meeting with Karzai .
Yesterday Ashraf Ghani , a former finance minister who says he will still stand against Karzai , told the Guardian that some of the president 's key allies visited him at his Kabul home to urge him to join the president 's team .
Observers complain that so far the campaign has been almost entirely dominated by potential candidates grasping for power , rather than by the many problems the country faces .
Yesterday the UN mission chief said he wanted to see the candidates spell out their policies for dealing with the big issues facing Afghanistan .
"" Where do the leaders want to take this country ?
What is their vision for Afghanistan ?
Not who they are , but what are the policies they intend to pursue , "" Eide said .
Although Karzai 's chances appear to be improving by the day , there are still fears that the legitimacy of the election result will be undermined by a low turnout and electoral fraud .
Yesterday Sima Samar , head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , highlighted the widespread corruption that had already occurred during the six - month voter registration period , with men illegally registering on behalf of dozens of women they claimed were family members .
Western officials fear that these men will not be stopped from using the cards to cast multiple ballots on election day .
"" If [ women ] do n't get the right to register themselves how can we be sure that they will participate physically on polling day ? "" Samar said ."
2009-05-04,"Senior diplomats and human rights workers lashed out at Hamid Karzai 's decision today to select a powerful warlord accused by western officials of involvement in criminal gangs and arms smuggling as a running mate in Afghanistan 's presidential election .
Karzai 's decision to defy international pressure and appoint Mohammad Qasim Fahim as one of his two vice - presidential candidates for the 20 August poll showed the world and the Afghan people that the president was "" moving the country backwards "" , said a western diplomat in Kabul , who is close to the UN chief in the country , Kai Eide .
"" I want to move to a situation where leaders and people who have a reputation for being involved in serious human rights violations disappear from the political landscape , and not the opposite , "" said the diplomat , who did not want to be named .
Karzai made his announcement today when he went to the Independent Election Commission in person to register as a candidate in the election , hours before leaving for meetings in Washington with President Barack Obama .
The former militia leader , who goes by the honorary title of Marshal Fahim , is disliked by many Afghans suspicious of the wealth he has acquired since 2001 and disliked by the west for his opposition to the disbandment of the private armies of Afghanistan 's warlords .
An official with an international mission in Kabul said Mr Fahim had been linked to kidnap gangs operating in the capital .
He is also accused of murdering prisoners of war during the mujahideen government in the 1990s .
Western diplomats have spent the last few weeks trying to dissuade Karzai from picking Fahim but the senior diplomat said the president refused to budge , arguing that the former militia leader would win him votes .
It will also help split a powerful opposition grouping , the United National Front , which Mr Fahim is a leading member of but which is not backing one of Karzai 's rivals for the presidential election .
Afghanistan 's warlords , the regional barons who controlled the militias that fought the Soviets in the 1980s , have been a major obstacle in the country 's post-2001 experiment with democracy .
For many of his critics , Karzai 's biggest mistake was to bring many of the warlords into government after the US - led toppling of the Taliban regime .
However , his defenders say he had no other choice after the international community deprived him of the resources he needed in the years immediately after 2001 .
A separate western official said : "" The question really is : if Karzai gets killed on August 21 [ the day after the election date ] who is the president ?
It 's Marshal Fahim .
If he is just put in the presidential palace and given a good car and nice life then fine .
But if he gets involved in policy then it 's goodbye to the future of Afghanistan . ""
Brad Adams , Asia director of Human Rights Watch , added to the criticism of the president 's selection . ""
To see Fahim in government would be a terrible step backwards for Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" He is one of the most notorious warlords in the country , with the blood of many Afghans on his hands from the civil war .
He is widely believed by many Afghans to be still involved in many illegal activities , including running armed militias , as well as giving cover to criminal gangs and drug traffickers .
The people of Afghanistan deserve better leadership .
The president is insulting the country with this choice .
"" Fahim is also regarded as a hate figure by the Taliban and could possibly hinder efforts to kickstart a peace process between the Afghan government and members of the hardline movement .
In selecting Fahim the president made amends with a man who earned his spurs as a leader in the anti - Soviet jihad , serving the guerrilla commander Ahmed Shah Massoud .
Fahim served as Karzai 's vice president and defence minister in the transitional government after 2001 .
He was stopped from running as vice - president in Afghanistan 's first democratic elections in 2004 by lobbying from the international community .
Like the other candidates in the race , Karzai was expected to create an ethnically balanced team .
The president is Pashtun , Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group comprising an estimated 40 % of the population .
While conventional wisdom holds that Pashtuns , who dominate the restive southern provinces , would not tolerate a leader from another ethnic group , they are not numerous enough to elect a president without the help of other communities .
It is hoped Marshal Fahim will help bring a substantial portion of northern ethnic groups , particularly from his Tajik community .
Karim Khalili , the vice - president today announced as Karzai 's other running mate , will be expected to deliver the Hazaras , a group of 4 million said to be descended from Genghis Khan .
Refugee to chief General Mohammad Qasim Fahim is a member of the Tajik community , Afghanistan 's second - largest ethnic group .
Born in the Panjshir valley in 1957 , he became a refugee in Pakistan after the communist coup in 1978 .
He was a mujahideen fighter during the 1980s war , commanding troops in the central province of Parwan and Baghlan .
He took over as military chief of the Northern Alliance two days before the World Trade Centre attacks , following the death of Ahmad Shah Massoud ."

2009-05-05,"The Pentagon today promised a joint investigation with the Afghan government into what could turn out to be one of the highest civilian death tolls yet from US coalition bombing .
Afghan officials estimated that at least 30 and possibly more than 100 were killed near the village of Ganjabad in Bala Baluk district , a Taliban - controlled area near the border with Iran .
The inquiry was announced on the eve of a summit at the White House tomorrow between President Barack Obama , the Pakistan president , Asif Ali Zardari , and the Afghanistan president , Hamid Karzai .
Obama called the two leaders together to set out details of his plan for countering the threat posed by al - Qaida and the Taliban in both countries .
Karzai , who over the last year has repeatedly criticised the US bombing raids as counter - productive , again called on the US for restraint in bombing areas where civilians might be at risk .
Speaking at a Washington think tank , the Brookings Institution , today , he said Obama 's strategy will only work if he makes sure Afghan civilians are protected .
Making it clear he was referring to the US , though without naming it , he said : "" This war against terrorism will succeed only if we fight it from a higher platform of morality . ""
He also blamed the resurgence of the Taliban and al - Qaida in Afghanistan on their being afforded what he called "" sanctuary "" in Pakistan .
Obama , on being elected in November , regarded Afghanistan as one of his top foreign policy problems .
But that has been superceded in recent weeks by concern over advances by the Taliban in Pakistan .
He is to offer to rush hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Pakistan to help fight the Taliban and al - Qaida in return for promises by the Pakistan military to respond more aggressively against them .
Richard Holbrooke , the US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , in a statement prepared for Congress today , said Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al - Qaida and the Taliban ."
2009-05-05,"President Barack Obama is planning to rush hundreds of millions of dollars to Pakistan to bolster its government in the face of advances by the Taliban and al - Qaida .
Obama is tomorrow to host at the White House a joint meeting with the Pakistan president , Asif Ali Zardari , and the Afghanistan president , Hamid Karzai , to discuss details of his plan for dealing with the threat posed by the Taliban and al - Qaida in both countries .
He is also to hold separate meetings with the two leaders .
Further meetings during the day are scheduled between the two leaders and the FBI , state department , the CIA and other federal agencies .
The fragility of Pakistan is now the top foreign policy issue in Washington .
A US official said that alarm about the stability of the Pakistan government had increased over the last few weeks .
Obama has asked Congress to speed up approval of funds for Pakistan , part of a $ 90bn - plus wartime spending budget unveilled by House Democrats yesterday .
Their bill provides $ 929.5 m ( £ 614.5 m ) , twice the amount Obama originally requested , to support Pakistan .
The budget includes $ 400 m for counterinsurgency training for the Pakistan army .
More US intelligence operatives are also to be sent to Pakistan .
In addition to the emergency funding , Obama has asked Congress to provide more than $ 6bn in aid to Pakistan over the next five years .
The chairman of the House appropriations committee , Dave Obey , said that while he would back the emergency spending request , he was dubious about the chances of success .
Obey told the Politico website : "" The president feels obligated to give it a shot , and we 'll help him give it a shot for a year .
At the end of the year , I want to have a hard - nosed , realistic evaluation based on the performance standards we 're talking about . ""
The standards include the performance of the Pakistan forces against al - Qaida and the Taliban and the ability of the Pakistan government to assert control over its own territory .
Obama is to raise with Zadari concerns about Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of the Taliban or its sympathisers .
Robert Gibbs , the White House spokesman , said : "" I do n't doubt that will be mentioned . """
2009-05-06,"Barack Obama today stepped up pressure on the leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan to adopt a more aggressive role in the battle against the Taliban who have made advances in both countries over the last few months .
He was speaking after a joint meeting at the White House with the Pakistan president , Asif Ali Zardari , and the Afghanistan president , Hamid Karzai .
The two day Washington summit began against a grim backdrop , with Pakistan fighting to wrest control back from Taliban forces in the Swat valley , and Afghans protesting about what they claimed was a US coalition air strike that left more than 100 civilians dead .
Taliban forces last month reached to within 60 miles of the Pakistan capital and have extended their areas of influence within Afghanistan .
Obama , flanked by Zardari and Karzai at the White House , was upbeat about the meeting , saying it had been an extraordinarily productive day : "" I 'm pleased that these two men - elected leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan - fully appreciate the seriousness of the threat that we face , and have reaffirmed their commitment to confronting it . ""
The US has repeatedly expressed dismay over what it regards as the failure of Pakistan and , to a lesser extent , Afghanistan to confront the Taliban and al - Qaida who operate within both countries with relative impunity .
Both Zardari and Karzai promised to lay aside traditional mistrust and vowed increased cooperation between the two countries to combat the Taliban and al - Qaida .
Karzai said the US could "" have full confidence in us "" , while Zardari promised that Pakistan was "" up to the challenge "" .
But there is deep scepticism within the Obama administration about the willingness and ability of either to deliver on their promises .
The three discussed various proposals , including cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan on policing the border , intelligence sharing and developing the tribal areas .
Karzai protested about US air strikes that killed Afghan civilians , and raised Monday 's attack in Farah province that could result in the highest civilian death toll since the US first became involved in Afghanistan in 2001 .
Obama told Karzai at the meeting he regretted the loss of civilian life and would make every effort to halt civilian casualties in Pakistan , though George Bush made a similar promise .
The Pentagon is still investigating and has not yet confirmed that there is a high civilian death toll or that coalition jets were responsible .
A spokesperson for US forces in Afghanistan said the bombings had been requested by an Afghan unit after it came under fire in the western province of Farah . ""
This was not coalition forces , this was Afghan national security forces who called in close air support , a decision that was vetted by the Afghan leadership , "" said Captain Elizabeth Mathias .
The Obama administration regards territorial gains made by the Taliban , al - Qaida and other militant groups in Pakistan as the biggest threat to US interests in the world .
But many foreign policy specialists in Washington are sceptical about the chances of success in the region , given the fragility of the Pakistan and Afghanistan governments .
Part of US frustration with Pakistan is over its failure to confront the Taliban in the Swat Valley .
Pakistan initially opted for a deal that handed over control of the area to militants who imposed sharia or Islamic law .
Clinton , who last month criticised Pakistan 's government for this move , today said she was "" quite impressed "" with Pakistan this week for reversing that decision and launching an offensive against the Taliban in the Swat Valley .
The Obama administration is seeking more such actions on the part of Pakistan in return for military and other aid .
The last such summit , held by Bush in 2006 , went badly , with relations between Karzai and the then Pakistan president , Pervez Musharraf , so poor they refused to shake hands .
Karzai and Zardari today shared warm words , with Zardari referring to Karzai as his "" brother "" and Karzai describing Afghanistan and Pakistan as twins joined at the hip .
The two put arms round one another at the White House to emphasise the good relations .
In spite of this , Karzai blames Taliban advances in Afghanistan on Pakistan , saying it offers them a sanctuary for mounting operations in Afghanistan .
In return , Zardari has expressed concern that Karzai is too close to Pakistan 's traditional rival , India ."
2009-05-06,"Neither of the two leaders whom President Obama met in Washington yesterday inspires confidence .
Neither President Asif Ali Zardari nor President Hamid Karzai is fully in control of their armed forces , let alone their countries , and both men have been tainted by allegations of corruption .
It would be easy for sceptics to argue that the aid packages to Afghanistan and Pakistan currently before the US Congress should be hobbled by unrealistic benchmarks .
That , however , would be a mistake .
There are two aspects to Pakistan 's problems - the Taliban 's strength in the tribal areas and the state 's weakness .
If it is true to say that government in Islamabad has been undermined by a succession of military dictators , Mr Obama should do everything he can to support the development of a mature and viable polity in Pakistan .
This is the logic of a bipartisan proposal by Senators John Kerry and Richard Lugar to provide $ 7.5bn over five years in economic as well as military aid .
In the Bush years , this money went unaudited into the pockets of army generals , who became substantial landowners and businessmen as a result .
Some of the money landed up in the hands of the very militants the Pakistan army is now battling in Swat , Dir and Buner .
But one can not simultaneously argue that it is a good thing for Washington to belatedly invest in the crumbling infrastructure of the tribal areas , while at the same time undermining its democratically elected president with talk of his impending demise .
Not everyone in the administration has realised that the current level of hyperbole in Washington about Pakistan ( that it is within "" six months "" of collapse , or that its nukes are loose and within al - Qaida 's grasp ) works against US interests .
It should seek to bolster a democratic consensus for Mr Zardari not undermine it .
The Pakistani president will need all the support he can get , if , as appears likely , the army is about to mount a full - scale assault on Taliban positions in Swat .
First , it could already be prompting the largest wave of refugees since partition .
Second , the assault by an army which relies on heavy artillery will be bloody .
The militants are dug in around the main town Mingora and prepared for battle .
But they , too , have seriously overplayed their hand by turning their guns against policemen and , by inference , the state itself .
The public mood has further been hardened by the words of the pro - Taliban cleric Sufi Mohammed , who branded Pakistan 's much fought for supreme court as un - Islamic .
At least it is comforting to know that Washington does not hold a monopoly of the misjudgments .
The Taliban is making its fair share of blunders as well ."
2009-05-07,"President Barack Obama met his Afghan and Pakistani counterparts in Washington yesterday .
Ewen MacAskill reports on US efforts to get Hamid Karzai and Asif Ali Zardari to help fight Islamist extremism in their countries .
The European court of human rights ruled in December that the government was wrong to retain the DNA of hundreds of thousands of innocent people .
Home affairs editor Alan Travis says the Home Office 's response to the ruling is likely to disappoint civil liberties campaigners .
Jennifer Cole , research analyst in emergency management at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank assesses the UK 's preparedness for swine flu .
And Peter Beaumont looks back at his 20 years of war reporting for the Observer ."
2009-05-08,"The timing may have been a disaster for Washington , but for villagers in Afghanistan 's south it was far worse .
A day after a US bombing killed up to 120 civilians in Afghanistan 's southern Farah province , President Obama asked the visiting presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan , Hamid Karzai and Asif Ali Zardari , to step up their attacks on Taliban and al - Qaida militants .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , expressed "" personal regret "" for the loss of lives as she looked in the direction of Karzai who , along with Zardari , addressed the media in the White House last Wednesday .
But in Afghanistan there were howls of condemnation and protests .
Bodies were being piled into trucks near the Bala Boluk district in Farah where the bombing occurred .
If estimates of more than a hundred fatalities prove accurate , it will represent the greatest loss of life in a single day since the US invasion of Afghanistan commenced in October 2001 .
Casualties are inevitable in any war .
But , as with Iraq since 1990 , it seems those directing the conflict from western capitals are not the ones whose societies are bearing the greatest losses .
That price is paid by ordinary Afghans and Pakistanis .
According to US airforce figures , 438 bombs were dropped over Afghanistan by American planes last April – a record number .
Last year was the worst for civilians caught up in the war against the Taliban that started in 2001 .
According to the Afghanistan Rights Monitor , 3,917 civilians were killed , more than 6,800 wounded and 120,000 were forced to leave their homes .
In neighbouring Pakistan , the conflict has proved a humanitarian catastrophe for villagers along the tribal belt that hugs the Durand line and the lower Himalayas in the north - west .
It is estimated that up to a million have been displaced by the conflict with the Taliban in Pakistan , while unknown thousands of civilians have been killed .
Pilotless US aircraft have killed around 700 of them .
Only a handful of those – around 14 – were militant leaders .
For years now Afghan officials have been asking American forces to take greater care in their operations to prevent civilian casualties .
Their Pakistani counterparts have constantly warned against military operations which , by harming so many civilians , stoke greater support for the Taliban . ""
Afghans are human beings , too , "" President Karzai remarked at a media conference two years ago .
That applies equally to Pakistanis caught in the conflict , but the fact is often lost in the heady rhetoric about defeating extremism and keeping our western borders secure from terrorism .
As usual , US officials announced an investigation into the Farah bombing .
Whether it will lead to a demonstrable reduction in civilian casualties is uncertain .
US military officials were quick to claim that the bombing was called in by Afghan National Army forces and could not be compared to the devastating aerial attack in Azizabad that claimed 90 civilian lives last August .
The US had earlier said that a handful of Taliban fighters had been killed during the raid , only to later acknowledge that civilians had died , albeit far fewer than the 90 claimed by the Afghan government and an independent UN investigation .
In the meantime , the war talk has reached fever pitch .
Despite calls for increased non - military aid aimed at improving socioeconomic conditions in areas most at risk of Taliban infiltration , the key thrust will be massive military operations by US and Pakistan forces .
In Congress last week , US defence secretary Robert Gates requested $ 400 m for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund aimed at training and arming Pakistani soldiers .
The fund is effectively Centcom commander David Petraeus 's money tin and would give the general a freer hand in directing operations by Pakistani forces .
A further $ 1bn in immediate or military aid has been proposed for Pakistan from a pool of requested "" emergency "" funds .
The Obama administration has praised Pakistan 's recent return to military operations against the Taliban .
The army is presently engaged in massive operations in the north - west of the country where militants had infiltrated into the Buner valley , a few hours ' drive west of the capital Islamabad , and Dir , further west towards the Afghan border .
In Dir , like Kohat and Dera Adam Khel to the south , districts to which I travelled recently , popular support for the Taliban is high thanks to ethnic loyalties and simmering resentment over inequality and civilian casualties .
The Taliban derive mostly from the Pashtun communities indigenous to Pakistan 's tribal areas , but non - Pashtun recruits , particularly from poor rural communities in southern and western Punjab , are believed to be increasing .
Fighting has recommenced in the Swat valley after Taliban militants who spilled out into neighbouring districts – like Buner and Dir – failed to abide by the terms of a recent peace agreement between the provincial government and a local pro - Taliban religious movement .
The situation is precarious for "" AfPak "" .
To avoid international isolation , governments from the two nations must continue the American agenda of overwhelming military response to the Taliban problem .
But as these operations continue to claim lives , support for the Taliban can be expected to grow .
For Obama and his western allies in the region , failure to bring stability could have serious political consequences .
The consequences for ordinary civilians , however , are already far more dire ."
2009-07-09,"The expected victory of Hamid Karzai in next month 's presidential elections in Afghanistan will trigger a violent backlash from ordinary Afghans , a top US commander in the country has warned .
Although the Taliban have threatened to disrupt polling day itself , David Haight , the US colonel who is in charge of pacifying two strategically vital provinces on the southern doorstep of the capital , Kabul , says he is far more concerned about the aftermath of the election .
"" I think the people down here are disgruntled with the government because there feeling is , look , '
I 'm just right to the south
, I 'm frigging 40 miles away and you could n't help me ? '
"" said Haight .
"" I think that apathy is going to turn into some anger because when the administration does n't change , and I do n't think anyone believes now that Karzai is going to lose ... I think there is going to be frustration from people who realise there is not going to be a change .
The bottom line is they are going to be thinking : ' four more years of this crap ? ' ""
Haight said .
An opinion poll last month suggested support for Karzai had slumped in the four and a half years since he became Afghanistan 's first democratically elected leader , but most western diplomats still believe he will easily win , possibly in the first round .
According to a poll of 3,200 Afghans from across the country , carried out by the International Republican Institute , Karzai can expect to receive 33 % of the vote , well below the half of all votes required to win the first round of the election , on 20 August .
In the 2004 election Karzai won 54 % of the vote .
But support for his opponents is considerably lower , and the likelihood remains that he will win comfortably .
Widely blamed for much of the corruption in modern Afghanistan , Karzai has nonetheless succeeded in gaining the support of most of the country 's most important ethnic and tribal power - brokers , including a number of unsavoury characters accused of human rights violations .
The only doubt is whether Afghanistan 's tribal warlords can deliver the necessary votes to Karzai , or whether the widespread disillusion with the corrupt state of the regime will lead voters to defy tribal and clan lines and back one of the opposition candidates .
There are also concerns about the independence of the election commission , which opponents accuse Karzai of stacking with loyalists .
Ashraf Ghani , former finance minister once tipped as a replacement for Kofi Annan as UN secretary general , is one of two leading opposition candidates .
He is about to hit the campaign trail , but has limited access to television , no official protection , and no helicopter .
He echoed Haight 's view that the Karzai administration had failed to deliver on security : "" In 2001 the Afghan people expected state - building and received bad governance and corruption .
Now as a result of the failure of this government and international community , they are demonstrating again the desire for legitimate and accountable state institutions . ""
Haight is the commander of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain Division in Logar and neighbouring Wardak .
The two provinces are home to an estimated 862,000 people and are strategically vital because not only do they make up the southern doorstep of the capital , they also straddle two of the most important roads in Afghanistan .
These were built at huge international expense to kick - start trade , but were swiftly taken over by Taliban insurgents and used as rapid access points for suicide bombers targeting the city .
Haight and his men were diverted from a slated tour in Iraq , allowing the number of US troops in the two provinces to soar from 300 to 3,000 .
The huge increase in numbers had an immediate impact , allowing the US to move beyond simply killing the odd Taliban , while leaving vast swathes of territory untouched , to a classic counter - insurgency campaign of clearing whole areas of insurgents , and then keeping them out by setting up company - strong combat outposts .
But the active insurgency on the doorstep of Kabul has created panic among many elite Afghans who fear that even with international support the government will not prove capable of stopping a movement that had publicly announced its ambition to "" encircle "" Kabul the year before .
"" The Taliban were never really threatening Kabul , but if you create the perception that you can do that , then you are winning , "" said Haight ."
2009-07-12,"Britain and the US are losing the war in Afghanistan and will see the return of al - Qaida and the possible collapse of Pakistan unless they succeed , the former Liberal Democrat leader , Lord Ashdown , warned today .
In his gloomiest assessment of the war , Ashdown said Britain made a military error of "" major proportions "" in Helmand province after being persuaded by Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , to adopt a "" Beau Geste "" strategy of protecting his supporters in forward forts .
In remarks likely to fuel the debate about the future of the war , Ashdown accused Britain and other European countries of setting "" ludicrously ambitious targets "" of attempting to turn Afghanistan into a fully democratic and progressive nation .
The former international representative to Bosnia , who nearly became the UN representative to Afghanistan last year , made his remarks in an outspoken interview with the Guardian after an increase in British casualties in Helmand .
Ashdown said the "" jury was out "" on whether the recent US reinforcements in the province would succeed . ""
This is a war we should be fighting , it is a war we have to win , "" he said .
"" But it is a war we are currently losing and the dynamic has been accelerating away from us .
The consequences of not winning it are grave .
If we lose southern Afghanistan , if we lose to the Taliban , then al - Qaida will be back . ""
He went on say that the west could lose Pakistan if Afghanistan was lost .
Ashdown said Britain had made "" classic errors in Helmand "" .
He said : "" The army were persuaded , for political reasons , to follow a Beau Geste strategy putting people , our people , out in forward forts , largely because the politicians were persuaded by Karzai that this was where his supporters and family lived .
It led to a military error of major proportions .
"" The army 's job in a war is to find and kill the enemy .
But in post - conflict reconstruction it is to take territory , hold it and rebuild .
We did n't follow the ' take , hold and build ' strategy in those early days . ""
"" We wasted most of our troops resources in protecting ourselves in forward forts .
That is not the policy we are following now .
But the consequence is that we have now lost the opportunity for take , hold and rebuild .
British and European plans for Afghanistan were mistaken from the outset , he said .
"" We set ourselves ludicrously ambitious targets for this and then completely under - resourced ourselves .
We set ourselves up for failure – this was more Britain than the US .
The US have held pretty close to the ' reasons we are in Afghanistan is because that is our frontline ' .
"" It is Britain and the Europeans who have raised this to ' we are going to create in Afghanistan a nation of European standards with gender - aware citizens ' , etc .
We went into Afghanistan with one-25th of the troops and a 50th of the aid per head of population that we put into Bosnia . ""
Ashdown warned Gordon Brown in 2007 that the ballot box would always take second place to guns in Helmand , and that Britain should lower its expectations .
In a memo to the prime minister and the former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice in December 2007 , he wrote that Britain and the US should accept that the Taliban would still exist , even after a reasonably successful military campaign . ""
"" The Taliban will still exist as an armed force , especially in the south , because here the insurgency is not about al - Qaida , but about deeply conservative Islamic Pashtun nationalism , with most locals preferring the Taliban , even if they do nasty things to them , to foreign troops . """
2009-07-13,"Gordon Brown has told the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , to put more Afghan troops into Helmand province immediately to make sure the costly territorial gains made by UK forces are not lost and British soldiers do not die in vain .
Amid mounting political pressure on the government over the sharp rise in British fatalities this month , Brown issued his demand to Karzai in a phone conversation on Sunday after talks with the US president , Barack Obama .
Less than 10 % of the 80,000-strong Afghan army are stationed in Helmand even though 50 % of the fighting is being conducted in the Taliban stronghold .
British forces have been repeatedly frustrated that they capture vital ground only for it to be ceded within months due to the lack of Afghan soldiers to move in and take control .
There are only 500 Afghan troops involved in the British Operation Panther 's Claw in Helmand province .
Brown said bluntly he wanted to see "" a very substantial increase "" in Afghan troop numbers .
He also gave a strong indication that the British presence will remain at the current figure of just over 9,000 troops , or might even increase after the Afghan presidential elections in August and a US - led 60-day review of the entire Nato Afghan strategy .
Britain is also temporarily sending an extra 140 soldiers from Cyprus .
The US - led review is likely to see General Stanley A McChrystal , the new senior commander in Afghanistan , recommend that the Afghan army will have to grow even faster than the planned expansion from 85,000 to 134,000 , which was initially expected to take five years but now fast - tracked for completion by 2011 .
US marines , currently deploying to Helmand , have been struck by the lack of support from the Afghan army .
The Foreign Office minister Lord Malloch Brown recently highlighted the UK 's concern , saying : "" We need to look at some slightly out - of - the - box solutions to supplement the numbers we have who are willing to protect communities from Taliban activity .
"" There is also a growing worry that the presidential election in August will fall way short of a democratic poll , with some observers fearing ballot rigging that will make the recent Iranian elections look like a model of western democracy .
In a Commons statement today , Brown brushed aside Conservative and Liberal Democrat claims that British troops are dying due to insufficient troop numbers or resources .
He said : "" It has been a very difficult summer and it is not over yet
but if we are to deny Helmand to the Taliban in the long term , if we are to defeat this insurgency , and by doing so make Britain and the world a safer place , then we must persist with our operations in Afghanistan …
I am confident that we are right to be in Afghanistan , that we have the strongest possible plan . ""
But a Populus poll for ITV 's News at Ten found 75 % of the population believe that the troops are inadequately supplied and equipped for the war .
The Tories claim there is a shortage of helicopters and blame Brown for cutting the helicopter budget by £ 1.4bn in 2004 .
It was noticeable that the Tories reined back on some of their rhetoric today , but the Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg , said the government strategy was "" over - ambitious and under - resourced "" .
Brown said the British military had told him that they had sufficient troops for current operational requirements .
He also denied that any helicopter shortfall had led to the recent British deaths .
Lieutenant Colonel Nick Richardson , an army spokesman , offered Downing Street a measure of support , saying : "" You could put as many helicopters as you wanted in here , but sadly at the end of the day troops have to go on the ground .
You can not defeat the enemy from a helicopter . """
2009-07-22,"In a country where politics is dominated by tribal chiefs , village mullahs and unsavoury warlords , the people of Afghanistan will tomorrow be treated to a unique exercise in modern democracy .
Millions of Afghans are expected to tune their televisions and radios in to the country 's first televised debate between the leading contenders in next month 's presidential election .
The organisers had hoped the debate , modelled on the set pieces of US presidential politics , would see the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , square off against his two main rivals – his former finance minister , Ashraf Ghani , and his former foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah .
But Karzai , who has been waging a traditional campaign focused on winning over ethnic and tribal powerbrokers through backroom deals , has decided not to risk a Nixon moment .
After days of uncertainty , Karzai 's campaign announced that he was pulling out 24 hours before the debate was due to begin , claiming that his policies were not ready .
The president , whose popularity has taken a battering during eight years leading Afghanistan , will now watch his two closest rivals soak up two hours of prime - time television .
The show 's producers , who have held endless negotiations with the three campaigns about the format of the debate and topics for discussion , have vowed that his empty podium will be left on the set – a move which has infuriated Karzai 's aides .
A spokesman for Karzai said that the president could take part in a debate only if it was broadcast on all of Afghanistan 's television channels , and said Tolo TV , the hugely popular network , was biased against the incumbent .
Ghani , a western - trained technocrat who was once mooted as a secretary general of the UN , said todayit was "" yet another broken promise "" by the president . ""
For the first time in our history we have the opportunity to come together virtually to see what our potential leaders have to offer .
But he does n't want to debate because he does not have a record to explain , "" he said .
As with any election the incumbent has the most to lose from a debate in which his enemies can attack his record .
Tolo , an independent - minded channel in Kabul that broadcasts in Persian , is determined to attract as many viewers as possible , simultaneously broadcasting the debate on its Pashtun sister station as well as on its nationwide radio station .
The mediator , Mujahid Kakar , is well - prepared for the debate after being the only Afghan journalist to have covered last year 's elections in the US . ""
Being in Chicago when Obama was declared winner was one of the most exciting moments of my life .
I covered all the debates
so I know how important these events can be , "" he said .
But with Afghanistan 's experiment with direct , democratic , elections being just five years old , no one knows whether the debate will have an impact similar to that seen by the US contests .
Sceptics say that the country has not yet shaken off the influence of ethnic and tribal power brokers over a largely illiterate and traditional population .
But Jahid Mohseni , one of the owners of Tolo TV , believes the boom in independent media in Afghanistan in recent years has helped to level the playing field and introduce a more modern form of politics .
He said : "" Tribal and ethnic considerations are much less important than they were , particularly in the cities .
And debates like this help to force leaders to talk about the policies we will all have to live with for the next five years . ""
Ghani , meanwhile , hopes to appeal to independently minded voters and has been waging a "" very 21st century campaign "" , in the words of one western diplomat .
His side boasts an Obama - esque website and often emails several press releases in a day .
Ghani has called in favours from top political operators within the Democratic establishment in the US .
These include James Carville , the strategist who masterminded Bill Clinton 's first presidential campaign .
Karzai , however , appears to betting heavily that it is business as normal and has so far not bothered to publish a manifesto nor hold more than one big public rally . ""
He still does n't think that he is a candidate ! ""
said Abdullah , an eye specialist who rose to prominence during the 1980s and 1990s when he served as an adviser to the resistance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud in his battles against the Russians and the Taliban . ""
After turning down a golden opportunity like this to talk to the nation I do n't think he can expect the people to listen to anything he has to say .
"" The president has held meetings with tribal chiefs and leaders of the main ethnic groups , trying to win over their support with the promise of jobs or assistance when he is elected .
Karzai has been happy to court even the most unsavoury of Afghanistan 's power brokers , including Marshal Fahim , a former warlord , whom he selected as his vice - presidential running mate .
The president is widely reported to have offered them cabinet posts , governorships and even the creation of new provinces in return for their support .
It has also emerged that he has pardoned five heroin smugglers , one of whom is related to the head of Karzai 's election campaign , although he denies the election has had anything to do with that decision .
Western diplomats are concerned that deals made for electoral purposes will derail efforts to curb corruption and improve government effectiveness – tasks that are seen as essential for draining popular support for Taliban insurgents .
Nonetheless , the flurry of deal making won Karzai the support of most of the country 's power brokers months before official campaigning began , which led many observers to assume he had the election sewn up .
Some believe , though , that Karzai has over - reached himself . ""
Karzai is counting on warlords , but I think he has misjudged the number of votes , "" said a western expert with years of experience in Afghanistan .
"" People do n't look at the jihad era and see Dostum [ an Uzbek strongman , accused of war crimes ] and Fahim as heroes – they are pretty much loathed by the population .
One of the reasons the Taliban are coming back is because of warlordism . ""
Ghani believes the president 's aura of invincibility burst when the US ambassador to Afghanistan , Karl Eikenberry , held meetings with the leading opposition candidates .
This was seen by many Afghans as a sign the Americans were distancing themselves from Karzai .
Karzai 's office denounced the meetings as "" direct interference "" by the US in Afghan politics . ""
And he is having problems in the south and east where they are really angry with the president , "" Ghani said of the insurgency - wracked Pashtun areas of Afghanistan which should be Karzai 's heartland .
Others blame a lacklustre election campaign .
"" Karzai 's campaign resembles the way he runs the government , "" said a leading Afghan businessman .
"" People are trying to steal money left , right and centre .
Even his posters were of the substandard quality and the glue used comes off in a few nanoseconds .
"" It is Abdullah who is regarded as the main threat to Karzai 's re - election chances , after winning the backing of Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor , the powerful governor of Balkh , a northern province seen as a beacon of prosperity and security .
One UN official said Karzai would be in grave danger if he failed to win more than 50 % of the votes , forcing a run - off .
"" It is increasingly likely that it could go to a second round .
If that happens then Abdullah and Ghani have an opportunity to take him out .
If they get agreement among themselves they have the potential to unseat him . """
2009-07-23,"Afghanistan 's first ever televised presidential debate struggled to ignite interest among voters in Kabul tonight after Hamid Karzai refused to take part and the programme moderator refused to let his rivals attack his record .
Many diners in the neon - lit restaurants of the capital paid only scant interest to the television screens during what should have been a historic discussion about the country 's future .
One group of men who arrived shortly after the beginning of the debate at the popular Herat eating hall immediately walked out when they saw the president had not turned up .
"" We 're going to find somewhere else to eat without a TV – there 's no point without Karzai , "" said Rahmat Ali , who said he worked on US army contracts .
His friend , Murtaza , a translator at a construction company , agreed , saying Karzai 's failure to appear was a "" major blow "" to his credibility . ""
If he ca n't face the nation then he obviously has no plans for how he will govern for another five years .
He has to explain what 's gone wrong in the country , "" he said .
The president pulled out of the debate 24 hours before it was supposed to begin , citing the fact that , with less than four weeks to polling day , he had not yet published his manifesto .
His campaign also argued that Tolo TV , the private channel hosting the debate , was biased against his campaign .
As promised , the station left Karzai 's empty podium on a sparse set , consisting of large banners in the colours of the country 's flag in case the president had a change of heart and turned up .
Early in the debate the two other participants , former ministers Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani , attempted to score points off the president 's absence .
But Mujahid Kakar , the senior Tolo journalist mediating , cut them off saying their attacks were unfair as Karzai was not there to defend himself .
"" I suppose if I criticise government policy you will just say that my brother is not hear to answer for himself , "" said a frustrated Abdullah at one point .
Many diners who were paying attention to the debate felt that Ghani put in a more effective performance .
Dressed in a traditional Afghan robe , he announced a number of policies , including a plan for compulsory national service and a push for a ceasefire with insurgents and a gradual reduction of foreign forces in the country .
One group hanging on Ghani 's every word was a crowd of 200 of his supporters in Shar - e - Naw park , watching proceedings on a big screen – cheering even his most obtuse points about electricity from central Asia ."
2009-08-02,"There are 17 days before Afghans go to the polls to elect a leader the west hopes can stamp out widespread corruption , a ruthless Taliban insurgency and a booming narcotics industry .
The Guardian 's correspondent in Kabul , Jon Boone , spent a week with two men challenging the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , who think they have the answers and the popular support to save their country .
The thousands of banner - wielding Afghans from the famously beautiful valley town of Bamiyan who had turned out to see their political hero were rewarded with eyes filled with dust , as the aged Russian transport helicopter carrying Dr Abdullah Abdullah touched down on the ragged airstrip .
The country 's former foreign minister , a man tipped as a real threat to Hamid Karzai 's re - election chances , walked through the abating swirl toward the throng of people that had filled up the route running down to the small town in Afghanistan 's central highlands .
The short stretch of concrete road gave Abdullah his first cue for the day 's campaigning : it is the only scrap of paved surface in a vast mountainous region where land transport involves journeys over bone - jarring roads that often become impassable in winter or wash away in the spring .
"" I came with Karzai here when he was interim president , "" the trained medic told the crowd when they had crammed into an enclosed space to hear local notables throwing their support behind him . ""
He promised that the next time he came there would be an asphalt road .
I arrive here today and it 's still the same situation of re - mudding the road .
"" It 's a sore point for the Hazaras , the inhabitants of the region , whose modern history has been one of oppression by Pasthtun - led governments and who since 2001 have received a fraction of the international aid that has been pumped into the insurgency - racked south of the country .
During a day 's campaigning last Wednesday , Abdullah blamed Karzai 's government for the slow pace of development , noting that the province remains so poor that some families still live in the caves carved into the same cliff face as the 6th century giant Buddhas that were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001 .
Administrative incompetence and weak leadership has become the mantra of both Abdullah and Dr Ashraf Ghani , a former World Bank official , the other candidate snapping at Karzai 's heels .
Last week , in the prosperous western city of Herat , which like other major cities has been plastered with posters for politicians standing in the presidential and provincial elections , Ghani was mobbed by supporters lining the road from the airport to mark his arrival .
Later , he said he had no concern for his safety , saying a warning from local police that there were four suicide bombers in the crowd was a tactic by his rivals to stop him campaigning .
"" It demonstrated the cowardice of the president , "" he said .
"" He is hiding behind the police and staying in his palace – why is he hiding ?
"" Violence has affected the candidates , particularly Abdullah .
One of his rallies was fired on in the eastern city of Jalalabad , and on 28 July one of his campaign managers was wounded and his driver killed during an attack on his vehicle .
Abdullah said it might not have been insurgents attempting to disrupt the vote .
"" People are suspicious not just of the Taliban …
Some are talking about people in the government security institutions , "" he said .
There is no up - to - date polling data to show the true level of support for Karzai and his two rivals – the last survey was conducted in May , before the campaign began .
The perception that things are moving against Karzai has largely been created by the vigour of the two campaigns , which have succeeded in attracting large crowds .
Ghani , who has a record of solid achievements during his time in office between 2001 and 2004 , is sometimes seen as a fine administrator , but lacking the skills of a politician .
In Herat last week he seemed hell - bent on proving his critics wrong , with a tub - thumping speech to a capacity audience in a cavernous hall .
The 60-year - old , who holds a PhD in anthropology and was once tipped to be secretary general of the UN , kicked off proceedings with three cries of "" Allahu Akbar ! ""
To roars of approval , Ghani laced his speech with references to Islam and a Qur'anic story about the end of the world coming "" when all the offices of state are filled with incompetents . ""
Although he did not attract the tens of thousands of supporters that Abdullah garnered during his campaign stop in the city , Ghani believes things are going his way .
Many of the men at his rally said they were attracted by Ghani 's promises to create jobs and develop the economy , and several said they were horrified by Karzai 's electoral alliances with unpopular warlords .
Others said they had come for the spectacle and a free lunch – an essential requirement for candidates looking to attract crowds .
In Bamiyan , lorries carrying packed lunches for Abdullah 's supporters were stormed by onlookers .
But Karzai still has formidable advantages , not least the support of many of Afghanistan 's tribal and ethnic leaders .
Among the Hazaras , thought to be the ultimate swing voters , Karzai has secured the support of the two most important community leaders , Karim Khalili and Mohammad Mohaqiq .
Abdullah says Afghans have matured politically in the last four years .
"" Who would have expected this sort of a turnout and reception four years ago in Bamiyan , which was always dominated by ethnic identity and regional issues ? "" he asks .
"" That shows things have changed and the grassroots have become more aware of their rights . ""
Ghani said the "" conventional wisdom "" that Karzai was unbeatable had been created by diplomats who hardly ever got out of Kabul .
An emerging view is that the two men will team up to take Karzai down – possibly before the election on 20 August , or certainly afterwards during a run - off if Karzai fails to gain the 51 % of the vote required to win outright .
Both men admit to maintaining , in Abdullah 's words , "" cordial relations "" with each other .
But for the time being they are both fighting to win ."
2009-08-10,"The crowds assembled in a remote village in Afghanistan 's mountainous hinterland may have been kept waiting without water in the baking heat for four hours , but no one was complaining , or even questioning why they were there .
"" We have come here to support Karzai because our leader has told us to vote for him , "" said Abdul Salim , a student and one of the thousands of Ismailis – the Shia sect that follows the Aga Khan – who flocked to see Hamid Karzai 's first campaign stop outside the capital .
When the president finally arrived at the rally in Kayan , he was given a suitably boisterous reception by thousands of Ismailis despite delivering a speech that was thin on ideas for solving the country 's many problems .
His three promises were to "" work for peace "" , extract even more money from Afghanistan 's western backers and push for economic development .
"" We have made a long journey with many successes , "" Karzai said of his record . ""
But our happiness has come with despair as we do not have overall security in the country . ""
But policy pronouncements are not the point in a place like Kayan , a traditional village that typifies Karzai 's reliance on religious and ethnic leaders to turn out voters for him .
The backing of key powerbrokers has led many observers of Afghanistan 's second ever presidential election to assume that Karzai enjoys an unassailable advantage over a crowded field of candidates , despite widespread dissatisfaction with his eight - year rule .
The prospect of a free lunch , entertainment and the sheer spectacle of the president of Afghanistan swooping in via helicopter to the village all helped attract crowds , many of whom arrived the night before to camp out in the valley .
Karzai 's appearance necessitated a huge security operation , with hundreds of elite Afghan soldiers arriving the day before to secure the site .
But the real draw was Syed Mansoor Nadiri , the spiritual leader in Afghanistan of the Ismailis .
Revered by his followers , many of whom paid obeisance to him by brushing their faces against his outstretched hands , Nadiri had put out the word that all Ismailis should vote for Karzai .
Some of the attendees seemed unaware they had come to attend a political rally , believing it was simply an Ismaili celebration .
Others were critical of Karzai but said they would still vote for him after their leader 's endorsement .
Printed cards were distributed throughout the crowd showing where they should put their tick in less than two weeks ' time , and speakers led the assembled crowd of several thousand in chants of "" Support Karzai ! ""
Standing next to Karzai on a covered stage , the Ismaili leader presented the president with a brown chapan , a traditional Afghan robe .
Nadiri 's son , a businessman who paid for the two - day festival , said his father had been courted by all the leading candidates in the 20 August poll – including Karzai 's two leading rivals , Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani .
But Nadiri said he decided to throw his support behind Karzai , despite his presiding over of rising violence and endemic corruption in his government .
He denied there had been any backroom deals with the president as many suspect . ""
The support and the backing the community has given to President Karzai has not been because of deal making –
this kind of enthusiasm and love that you see can not be bought , "" he said .
"" If we look at his cabinet we see every minority group is represented . ""
This is the first time in the history of Afghanistan that we have seen all groups included .
"" With Karzai still tipped to prevail in the poll Nadiri is anxious the Ismailis , a long persecuted and impoverished minority , should be on the winning side .
During the Soviet occupation of Afganistan in the 1980s , Kayan avoided much of the destruction in the rest of the country by declaring itself a "" neutral "" territory .
But the village and the grand Nadiri family house , which boasted a swimming pool and an electric train , were laid to waste ."
2009-08-13,"A series of secret ceasefire deals have been agreed with Taliban commanders to ensure that voting can go ahead in Afghanistan 's volatile south during next week 's presidential elections .
Under the deals , brokered by Ahmed Wali Karzai – the controversial brother and campaign manager of the president , Hamid Karzai – individual Taliban commanders will agree to pull back on election day and allow the Afghan army and police to secure the polling centres .
A Nato spokesman confirmed that a number of deals between the Afghan government and insurgents were in the pipeline , saying : "" We support any initiative that enhances security and enables the people of Afghanistan to vote . ""
The US embassy has given its blessing to the plan , which was discussed last week at a joint meeting of the country 's national security chiefs .
Many of the key negotiations with local Taliban commanders in the south are being handled by Wali Karzai , who is also the powerful head of Kandahar 's provincial council .
He is running his brother 's re - election campaign in the southern Pashtun belt .
The Guardian was told by Wali Karzai that truces in some of the country 's most violent provinces , including Helmand and Kandahar , would be announced in the next few days with individual commanders .
The deal would allow for more polling stations to open ; officials had said that as many as 700 of the country 's 7,000 voting centres would stay closed .
Wali Karzai said that commanders were split on whether or not to follow the orders of Mullah Omar , the Taliban leader , who wanted the election disrupted .
"" It will all depend on the group and who they are connected with .
Some Taliban leaders will look the other way , but others will say no , stop them , this is helping the Jew and the Christian in this war . ""
The prospect of the south being unable to vote has worried the Afghan president , who needs the votes of his fellow Pashtuns , the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan , to ensure victory without having to go to a second - round run - off .
It also alarmed western powers anxious that the strife - torn region might be further destabilised if the election were won by a candidate who did not enjoy support in the Pashtun belt .
Wali Karzai said many local Taliban commanders shared those fears despite the stance of Omar .
"" I just had a meeting with a very , very , influential Taliban commander , "" he said .
"" I told him , look , the election will happen despite these four provinces participating or not .
Whether we take part or not , the election will happen because Afghanistan is 32 provinces –
they are not going to wait for what Kandahar is going to do . ""
Asked whether the Taliban were concerned at the prospect of low - voter turnout in the south letting a non - Pashtun win the election , he said : "" Absolutely , they are saying this , they understand this .
How can it be that in the ' war on terror ' the frontline is the Pashtun ?
How can the Pashtun become an opposition in this war ?
What will happen if there is a Pashtun civilian casuality ?
Right now we have a president who will take the matter up . ""
Wali Karzai is a controversial figure .
The older half - brother of the president , he enjoys huge power in Kandahar and is alleged to be involved in drug trafficking , a claim he vociferously denies .
he rebutted a report in the German news magazine Stern that British forces had seized tonnes of opium on his land last month .
He claimed this was a political attack aimed at hurting the president before the elections .
But speaking at his home in Kandahar , he exuded confidence about the prospects for his brother 's re - election , saying rivals , including the former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah , did not have extensive support .
He said : "" We have absolutely the complete support of 90 % or 95 % in the south .
How to bring people to the polling stations will be our major concern next week .
My challenge in organising this thing is security , it 's not Abdullah Abdullah or Ashraf Ghani . ""
Taliban ceasefires allowing voters to turn out in the Pashtun heartland will be a big boost to the re - election plans .
The official line from Taliban spokesmen based in Pakistan is that Afghans should not participate in the election .
There have also been threats to disrupt election day by blocking roads leading to the polling centre and intimidating voters .
Taliban commanders are reported to have threatened to kill anyone they find with a finger marked with indelible ink – a stain meant to prevent people from voting more than once .
However , a western expert in Kandahar , with extensive knowledge of the security situation in the south , said that Taliban threats to disrupt the election had been half - hearted .
"" I do n't see a well articulated mass of oppositions to the electoral process – we have seen incidents in recent weeks , but it is not systematic . ""
Wali Karzai warned , however , that some groups would be implacable , including that of Mullah Dadullah , a senior Taliban commander killed in 2007 .
"" I will only really know which groups have kept their promise after the election , "" he said .
Many analysts believe one of the reasons the elections in 2004 went relatively smoothly was because of international pressure on Pakistan to rein in militants operating in Afghanistan with links to the Pakistani intelligence service .
"" I hope that happens again – last time it was like someone just pressed a button to stop these people coming in from over the border , "" Wali Karzai said .
He also revealed that a number of tribal militias would be mobilised in the south to help guarantee security at election centres – a move that has been denounced by democracy activists who fear it will make electoral fraud easier .
It is thought that armed men controlled by local militia leaders could intimidate many people into voting for their preferred candidate , or even commit outright election fraud such as ballot box stuffing .
Jandad Spinghar , the chief executive of the Free and Fair Elections Foundation in Afghanistan , said militias were a threat to the election .
"" They can interfere with the process because they have local power .
Their presence will also stop our observers from reporting on the election freely and fairly . """
2009-08-14,"Afghanistan has quietly passed a law permitting Shia men to deny their wives food and sustenance if they refuse to obey their husbands ' sexual demands , despite international outrage over an earlier version of the legislation which President Hamid Karzai had promised to review .
The new final draft of the legislation also grants guardianship of children exclusively to their fathers and grandfathers , and requires women to get permission from their husbands to work .
"" It also effectively allows a rapist to avoid prosecution by paying ' blood money ' to a girl who was injured when he raped her , "" the US charity Human Rights Watch said .
In early April , Barack Obama and Gordon Brown joined an international chorus of condemnation when the Guardian revealed that the earlier version of the law legalised rape within marriage , according to the UN .
Although Karzai appeared to back down , activists say the revised version of the law still contains repressive measures and contradicts the Afghan constitution and international treaties signed by the country .
Islamic law experts and human rights activists say that although the language of the original law has been changed , many of the provisions that alarmed women 's rights groups remain , including this one : "" Tamkeen is the readiness of the wife to submit to her husband 's reasonable sexual enjoyment , and her prohibition from going out of the house , except in extreme circumstances , without her husband 's permission .
If any of the above provisions are not followed by the wife she is considered disobedient .
"" The law has been backed by the hardline Shia cleric Ayatollah Mohseni , who is thought to have influence over the voting intentions of some of the country 's Shias , which make up around 20 % of the population .
Karzai has assiduously courted such minority leaders in the run up to next Thursday 's election , which is likely to be a close run thing , according to a poll released yesterday .
Human Rights Watch , which has obtained a copy of the final law , called on all candidates to pledge to repeal the law , which it says contradicts Afghanistan 's own constitution .
The group said that Karzai had "" made an unthinkable deal to sell Afghan women out in the support of fundamentalists in the August 20 election "" .
Brad Adams , the organisation 's Asia director , said : "" The rights of Afghan women are being ripped up by powerful men who are using women as pawns in manoeuvres to gain power . ""
These kinds of barbaric laws were supposed to have been relegated to the past with the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 , yet Karzai has revived them and given them his official stamp of approval . ""
The latest opinion poll by US democracy group the International Republican Institute showed that although Karzai was up 13 points to 44 % since the last survey in May , his closest rival , Abdullah Abdullah , had soared from 7 % to 26 % .
If those numbers prove accurate , it would mean the contest would have to go to a second round run - off vote in early October .
In that scenario , 50 % of voters said they would vote for Karzai and 29 % for Abdullah .
The survey was conducted in mid to late July , so it is not known whether Abdullah has made further gains on Karzai .
He could further increase his chance of victory by joining forces with Ashraf Ghani , the former finance minister who is also running on a platform fiercely critical of Karzai .
Fifty - eight per cent of the 2,400 people polled by IRI said they would like to see an alliance between Abdullah and Ghani , who is polling in fourth place ."
2009-08-17,"With just three days to go until presidential elections on Thursday Hamid Karzai finally took part in a televised debate with his leading competitors yesterday , although the man polling in second place , Abdullah Abdullah , failed to turn up .
The debate on state - run television saw a blistering performance by Ramazan Bashardost , a populist anti - corruption campaigner and MP who used his airtime to attack Karzai 's record and the rampant graft in the current government , which he said was the main cause of insecurity .
The aggressive style of the former planning minister will probably go down well with the audience , who could also listen to a radio broadcast of the debate .
Bashardost attacked Karzai 's claim that he had brought national unity to Afghanistan , saying the representatives of the country 's various ethnic groups which Karzai appointed to his cabinet were warlords who had failed to deliver basic public services .
Karzai adopted a far more restrained style , continually stressing what he said had been his successes in power , particularly the construction of schools , roads and other basic infrastructure .
Although the third candidate in the debate , former finance minister Ashraf Ghani , put in solid performance , he trails in fourth place in opinion polls .
Earlier in the day the country 's powerful intelligence chief confirmed that the government had successfully struck deals with some Taliban commanders to allow voting to go ahead , as revealed by the Guardian last week .
Amrullah Saleh , the head of the National Security Directorate , said some insurgent leaders had agreed to disobey the Taliban leadership and not attack voters or polling stations .
He said money had been paid as part of the deals .
The defence minister , Abdul Rahim Wardak , also announced that Afghan government forces would observe a ceasefire on Thursday ."
2009-08-19,"Whatever the result of tomorrow 's election in Afghanistan , the Obama administration intends to resume its push for the appointment of a Western - style chief executive in an attempt to curb the worst of the country 's endemic corruption and expand the influence of the Kabul government in the face of Taliban advances .
The plan to insert a chief executive to work under the president reflects continued lack of faith in the ability of the expected winner , Hamid Karzai , to implement reforms regarded as essential to winning the war , such as a crackdown on the opium trade .
There is also little enthusiasm in Washington for Karzai 's main rival , Dr Abdullah Abdullah .
The third main presidential candidate , Ashraf Ghani , is favourite for the chief executive slot , a US official familiar with discussions in Washington said yesterday .
Ghani has spent much of his life outside Afghanistan , including a spell at the World Bank , but polls suggest he has little chance of winning .
He has been in discussion with US officials , including the US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , and the US ambassador , Karl Eikenberry , although he has denied that he has turned down the job offer .
"" I 've been approached repeatedly ; the offer is on the table .
I have not accepted it , "" he told reporters last weekend .
Karzai 's aides have apparently offered Ghani the job , but relations between the US and Karzai have reached such a low point that there is little faith in Washington that he will deliver on his promise to name Ghani or even to appoint a chief executive at all .
US officials fear that Karzai may have offered the job to several rivals , as well as Ghani .
The Guardian first revealed earlier this year that the Obama administration was pressing Karzai to appoint a chief executive .
The role would be to try to make the Kabul government efficient , increase its visibility in various remote provinces , and cut the alleged links between the government and the drug trade .
Earlier this year Obama , who has switched the focus of US policy from Iraq to Afghanistan , set out a broad strategy for Afghanistan based on an increase in the number of US troops , an expansion of the Afghan army and police , more emphasis on economic development , stabilisation of the border with Pakistan , and the stepping up of the hunt for Osama bin Laden and other al - Qaida leaders .
US officials in Washington , Kabul and Islamabad are now working out the detail of how to implement that strategy , given the difficulties of working in the fractured country and complaints about a lack of co - operation from the Kabul government .
Washington views Karzai as a good dealmaker with other politicians but a poor administrator , but in the run - up to the election US officials held off criticising the president in order not to be seen to be interfering in the vote .
The new US commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , who took over when General David McKiernan was unexpectedly sacked in May , is due to send to Obama in the next few weeks his assessment of a counter - insurgency strategy .
Much of his assessment is expected to be similar to McKiernan 's , which is basically to train the Afghan army and police as quickly as possible and speed up economic development .
McChrystal has already implemented one change , ordering aircrews not to drop bombs if in doubt about the presence of civilians .
He wants an expansion of this approach , aimed at improving relations between the US military and civilians and the Afghan population .
McChrystal has been reported to favour asking for more US troops but , with the US military increasingly politicised , he may decide against , given the drop in support for the war among the public and Congress as the death toll mounts .
Obama earlier this year ordered 17,000 more US troops to Afghanistan .
The White House national security adviser , Jim Jones , who had ruled out more troops , said in a recent television interview he was "" not ruling it out "" ."
2009-08-20,"Afghan officials began the formidable task of counting millions of votes cast in the presidential election today amid signs that , in some parts of the south at least , turnout may have been low because of the threat of violence .
Voting was extended by an hour to allow more people to cast ballots in the race pitting the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , against a broad range of challengers , and UN officials expressed cautious optimism that a healthy turnout could yet emerge .
But there were indications that some voters , particularly in the violent south , may have avoided polling stations because of the Taliban campaign of intimidation that has hung heavy over the country 's second presidential election since the 2001 US - led invasion .
Sporadic violence , including rocket and bomb attacks , targeted several polling sites , and some had to be closed temporarily .
Karzai said there were 73 separate attacks in 15 provinces on polling day .
Officials said 26 Afghan civilians and security forces were killed in election day attacks .
Concerns were also raised over the robustness of the measures to prevent voter fraud as it emerged that the supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent them voting more than once could be removed with a brand of domestic detergent .
Kabul , which has been relatively untouched by the violence that has swept through the rest of Afghanistan in recent years , has been targeted recently by Taliban fighters whose expressed objective is to disrupt the vote .
Officials at some polling stations reported a thin turnout .
"" We have n't seen anyone for about an hour , "" said one polling station chief in the north of the capital this afternoon .
"" Despite some initial attacks in the early morning , voters have demonstrated their determination to participate , "" said Aleem Siddique , spokesman for the UN mission in Kabul .
"" As the afternoon has proceeded , we have seen less attacks , we have seen the situation settle . ""
Top US military officers said that most polling stations did open and that the day had passed without a Taliban - inspired spectacular .
General David Petraeus , the head of US central command , paraphrased his senior commander on the ground , General Stanley McChrystal , in reporting that of 6,519 polling station , 6,200 managed to open . ""
The vast majority of the population did have the oportunity to cast a ballot , "" Petraeus said .
He said he believed turnout in the south "" built "" through the day .
But an election observer in Kandahar said the day had been fraught .
"" From the morning until now we have had constant rockets , maybe 15 or so . ""
And he says it had a crippling effect on turnout . ""
Until 10 o'clock people were coming but about half as much as 2004 .
But later no one was coming as the situation got worse and worse . ""
A weak turnout in the Pashtun - dominated south would be likely to threaten Karzai 's chances of re - election .
The incumbent scored heavily in the south and east during his first election victory five years ago .
The government has attempted to impose a media blackout on attacks in the run - up to polling to stop people being discouraged from voting , but reports of violence continued to filter through .
Two Taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle after they took over a disused building in the east of the capital .
The commando - style raid was the second in as many days after three insurgents wearing explosive - laden suicide vests were killed by Afghan security forces yesterday in a bank building near the presidential palace .
At a high school in Kabul serving as a polling centre , an explosion wounded an election monitor and briefly shut down voting , an election observer named Ezatullah said .
Security companies in the capital reported at least five blasts .
In the southern city of Kandahar , insurgents hanged two people because their fingers were marked with the ink showing they had voted , the New York Times reported .
More than 20 rockets fell in Lashkar Gah , the capital of Helmand province , in the south , including one that landed near a line of voters , killing a child .
Rockets hit the cities of Kandahar , Ghazni and Kunduz , where two election observers were wounded at a polling station .
In the eastern city of Gardez , a police official said two suicide bombers on motorcycles blew themselves up without causing casualties .
In northern Baghlan province , insurgent attacks closed 14 polling sites and several police officers were killed , said Abdul Malik , the provincial election director .
The first results in the election are not expected until Saturday .
A second round will be held if no candidate secures 50 % .
One election official told the Associated Press he anticipated a turnout of 40 % to 50 % .
Karzai urged people to ignore the violence when he voted at a Kabul high school , dipping his index finger in the supposedly indelible ink and holding it up for the cameras .
"" I request that the Afghan people come out and vote , so through their ballot Afghanistan will be more secure , more peaceful , "" Karzai said .
Preliminary results are expected to be announced in Kabul on Saturday ."
2009-08-21,"Despite calls by the US for the leading candidates in Afghanistan 's election not to claim victory , both Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah said they won yesterday 's vote .
Although the first early official results are not expected until Saturday or even Sunday , both campaign teams claimed they were ahead , with President Karzai 's staff saying he had taken a majority of votes , making a second round run - off unnecessary .
Abdullah 's spokesman , Sayyid Agha Hussain Fazel Sancharaki , said the former foreign minister was ahead with 62 % of the vote .
Pajwok , an Afghan news agency that began last night to collate unofficial results published by individual polling centres , said the two candidates were "" virtually in a dead heat "" , with Abdullah doing best in the provinces immediately north of Kabul and Karzai grabbing votes in the south and east .
The US had hoped to avoid such speculation and the secretary of state , Hilary Clinton , announced three days before the poll that she expected people to "" refrain from speculation until results are announced "" .
Fearing that disputes between candidates could turn ugly , she called on "" candidates and their supporters to behave responsibly "" .
Foreign election observers also urged caution , saying a poll conducted in virtual combat zones in some parts of the country was particularly hard to analyse .
The country 's deputy chief electoral officer , Zekria Barakzai , called on candidates to await the official results .
He said turnout was between 40 % and 50 % , far lower than the 70 % of voters who took part in Afghanistan 's first presidential election in 2004 .
Figures on regional turnouts will be eagerly awaited as expected low turnout in the south could eat into Karzai 's support .
According to the official timetable of events , preliminary results are not due until 3 September , with the final certified results coming in two weeks later .
That will give election officials time to investigate widespread allegations of fraud .
The campaign team of Ashraf Ghani , another leading candidate , said they were particularly worried about reports of ballot box stuffing in areas in the south where election observers were unable to visit .
Suspiciously high turnouts of women in the south will also be scrutinised as huge numbers of fake voter registration cards in the name of women are known to be in circulation ."
2009-08-21,"Western powers rushed today to declare Afghanistan 's presidential elections a success despite evidence of irregularities and violence on polling day and growing uncertainty about whether the vote would return a credible result .
Both the leading candidates , Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah , declared they had won yesterday 's poll , generating concerns of a full - blown dispute .
Election officials warned that it would take several days to determine the result and the extent to which voting had been marred by corruption and low voter turnout .
Last night Barack Obama described the election as "" an important step forward "" in attempts by Afghans to take control of their future .
Referring to attempts by the Taliban to derail the democratic process , he said : "" Even in the face of this brutality , millions of Afghans exercised the right to choose their leaders and determine their own destiny . ""
He added : "" I believe that the future belongs to those that want to build , not those who want to destroy . ""
Anders Fogh Rasmussen , Nato 's secretary general , said the poll was a "" clear demonstration that the Afghan people want democracy , they want freedom and reject terrorism "" .
Richard Holbrooke , the US special envoy to the region , said the Taliban had "" utterly failed to disrupt these elections , "" despite a day of clashes .
Other western diplomats were also bullish about a poll they said could have been "" far worse "" in terms of Taliban attacks .
US military officials have already qualified the vote as a reasonable success .
But democracy and rights groups offered a more sober assessment .
The Washington - based International Republican Institute praised the campaign , but said : "" Unfortunately , such issues as lower turnout , fraud and abuse of state resources brought these elections to a lower standard than the 2004 and 2005 Afghan elections . ""
Human Rights Watch also questioned whether "" one of the most violent days witnessed in Afghanistan in the last eight years "" could be described as a success .
Rachel Reid , an HRW researcher in Afghanistan , said the claims would "" not ring true "" for Afghans living in the south and east , where Taliban attacks were most severe .
"" They deserve an honest assessment … If international standards are dropped , there risks being a serious credibility gap , which will only serve to increase disillusionment with the efforts to create a democracy . ""
A senior Nato envoy cautioned against being too quick to welcome results that could turn sour if examples of mass fraud were detected .
Western powers with more than 60,000 troops in Afghanistan are eager to the elections being deemed a sham or a muddle , compounding a worsening security situation in which dozens of foreign troops are dying each month .
The post - election uncertainty is not helping to calm tension .
The Independent Election Commission said today it would not publish any official data until Tuesday .
Glenn Cowan , an observer from Democracy International , said the decision was "" probably a mistake "" .
"" Almost all elections add somewhat to political tension and this one is not different , "" he said .
"" The best way to relive that tension is to provide information to people about an already uncertain election . ""
That uncertainty has stemmed from three principal factors : violence , intimidation of voters and candidates , and allegations of fraud .
The election complaints commission said it had received around 120 complaints so far , mostly relating to allegations of voter fraud , intimidation of voters and ballot - box stuffing , but the main candidates were unwilling to criticise the process , with Abdullah saying the vote had been "" quite good "" .
After polls closed yesterday Ashraf Ghani , the candidate who had been polling in fourth place , called for calm .
He also said : "" The fifth most corrupt government in the world has shown that in its relentless desire for power it would hold no law sacred and violate all legal and constitutional norms . """
2009-08-23,"Hamid Karzai 's main political rival today accused the Afghan president of "" stealing "" last week 's presidential vote by orchestrating a campaign of massive electoral fraud .
In an withering attack on an election process that Afghanistan 's international backers are desperate should be seen as legitimate , Abdullah Abdullah pinned the blame on Karzai and his team for what he claimed were fraudulent results emerging from the country 's southern and eastern regions .
He told the Guardian : "" It was led by Mr Karzai .
He knew .
He knew that without this he can not win , about that I have no doubt in my mind . ""
Abdullah said he had evidence of widespread fraud in the south and east , where Taliban violence during Thursday 's poll is thought to have suppressed voter turnout .
He accused the head of the border police in Kandahar province , General Abdul Raziq , of intimidation and of moving ballot boxes into his house , which only Karzai supporters were allowed to enter .
Abdullah said : "" We will challenge it through legal means , we will exhaust every avenue legally in order to prevent this sort of big rigging , this is stealing a nation 's verdict . ""
He denounced the chief of the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) , the body that foreign election observers have criticised for being full of Karzai appointees , for working "" for Mr Karzai and not the good of the country "" .
The Election Complaints Commission – an independent organisation that is majority - controlled by international officials – said it had received 225 complaints , including allegations of voter intimidation , ballot box stuffing and bias by IEC officials .
It said it was concentrating on 35 cases that could potentially affect the outcome of the election .
The IEC is due to publish some early data on Tuesday .
Mirwais Yasini , an election outsider , also alleged massive voter fraud today when he displayed bags full of ballots that he claimed were cast for him in Kandahar but taken away to be destroyed before they were counted .
Abdullah said that in the northern provinces , where he did not allege widespread fraud , he was ahead of Karzai in about 16 provinces .
Karzai 's campaign team , who have been collating their own results from individual polling stations , are convinced that the president has won a landslide victory with more than 50 % of the vote , making a second run - off vote unnecessary .
Some Karzai supporters believe he has won as much as 70 % of the votes .
Such an overwhelming result would stretch credulity to breaking point for many people , as well as being a severe embarrassment for the western powers anxious for the election to be accepted quickly .
It would risk angry demonstrations from Abdullah 's supporters , although he insists he will call for calm .
"" I mobilised my supporters and I can restrain them , "" he said .
A senior UN official warned there would be "" no real legitimacy if Karzai claims to have won on the first round "" .
He said : "" If the international community say it is all wonderful , they lose further credibility and are associated with an illegitimate government .
And if they say it was fraud then their publics will say ' why are we there then ? '
Neither way is it a good result for Afghanistan . ""
He said the only solution would be a clean second - round contest or some sort of conciliatory deal between Abdullah and Karzai .
One of Abdullah 's aides said the president would have to accept that he could no longer run Afghanistan on his own and would have to share power with the former foreign minister , possibly by accepting his proposals for constitutional change that would empower parliament . ""
This election has shown that President Karzai has to share power and has to change the constitution , "" the aide said .
"" Things are changing in Afghanistan .
The message has been sent that the days when he enjoyed full power and privileges are gone . """
2009-08-23,"Hamid Karzai will face a crisis of legitimacy and a legal challenge to his re - election if he is proclaimed the outright winner of Afghanistan 's presidential ballot on Tuesday , opponents and an UN official warned today , as his chief rival accused him of "" stealing "" the election .

The prospect of a protracted post - election dispute is an unhappy one for the US and its main partners in the Isaf force in Afghanistan , Britain , Canada and Germany , who are eager to declare the vote acceptable and avoid the uncertainty , delay and confrontation that could aggravate an already parlous security situation .
The US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Admiral Mike Mullen said the situation was "" serious and deteriorating , "" and that the Taliban insurgency "" has gotten better , more sophisticated in their tactics "" .
An ABC news / Washington Post poll released last week showed that US public support for the war in Afghanistan has declined steeply , with more than half the US for the first time saying the war is not worth fighting .
Fifty - one per cent of Americans say it is not , compared to 47 % who say it is .
A flawed election will not make it easier to justify the conflict .
Abdullah told the Guardian he had evidence of widespread fraud in the south and east , where Taliban violence during Thursday 's poll is thought to have suppressed voter turnout .

He denounced the chief of the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) , the body that foreign election observers have criticised for being full of Karzai appointees , for working "" for Mr Karzai and not the good of the country "" .
The Election Complaints Commission – an independent organisation that is majority - controlled by international officials – said it had received 225 complaints , including allegations of voter intimidation , ballot box stuffing and bias by IEC officials .
It said it was concentrating on 35 cases that could potentially affect the outcome of the election .
The first set of electoral data is set to be published on Tuesday .
Mirwais Yasini , an minor presidential candidate election outsider , also alleged massive voter fraud , when he displayed bags full of ballots he claimed were cast for him in Kandahar but were taken away to be destroyed by his opponents before they were counted .
Dr Abdullah said that in the northern provinces – where he did not allege widespread fraud – he was ahead of Karzai in about 16 provinces .
But despite his defiant tone , he said he would refrain from calling for the kind of manifestations that plunged Iran into post - electoral convulsions earlier this summer .
"" I mobilised my supporters and I can restrain them , "" he said .
The senior UN official warned that the only solution would be a clean second - round contest or some sort of conciliatory deal between Abdullah and Karzai .
One of Abdullah 's aides said the president would have to accept that he could no longer run Afghanistan on his own and would have to share power with the former foreign minister , possibly by accepting his proposals for constitutional change that would empower parliament . ""
This election has shown that President Karzai has to share power and has to change the constitution , "" the aide said .
"" Things are changing in Afghanistan .
The message has been sent that the days when he enjoyed full power and privileges are gone . """
2009-08-24,"Fraud in Afghanistan 's presidential election may have compromised as many as one in five ballots , a UN official warned today , compounding fears that ballot - stuffing , intimidation and other irregularities could have a decisive impact on the vote .
Afghanistan 's election commission sought to play down fears that vote - rigging in the country 's presidential election would decide the outcome of the contest .
But concerns were mounting that electoral fraud in the south and east of the country , where few election monitors dared to tread , could help push the number of votes cast for the president , Hamid Karzai , over 50 % , handing him victory without the need for a second - round contest .
Partial results are expected to be announced later .
One UN official predicted that anywhere between 10 % and 20 % of the votes cast were illegal , and that negotiations would have to be made to "" massage down "" Karzai 's victory margin .
Independent election monitors said almost 700 complaints had been received , around 50 of which were earmarked for immediate investigation because of the risk they could change the outcome .
But the Independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) , which will publish a small portion of the results tomorrow , said the reported cases of fraud "" could not affect the result of the election "" .
"" We have reached the conclusion that 35 cases of reported fraud and violations is not widespread , given the number of polling centres is 6,300 , "" said Zekria Barakzai , the IEC deputy head .
"" Whoever makes claims that there is widespread fraud should show evidence . ""
A separate body , the Electoral Complaints Commission , said a steady flow of official complaints had been received .
Among a list of 38 complaints lodged by Ashraf Ghani , the former finance minister , were claims that people were forced to vote for the former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah at gunpoint in the northern province of Balkhm , and of ballot box - stuffing in the western city of Herat .
The ECC , which is run by a board made up mainly of foreigners , has wide - ranging powers to cancel the results from individual polling stations where fraud has been detected .
However Ramazan Bashardost , one of the leading presidential candidates , believes the requirement for good quality evidence in areas where it may be hard to collect reliable eyewitness details will make it extremely difficult to discount large numbers of votes .
Mirwais Yaseni , the deputy speaker of Afghanistan 's lower house of parliament , and a presidential candidate , claims thousands of votes cast for him where removed from ballot boxes and earmarked for destruction before being discovered by his supporters .
He said the only option available was to "" abolish the election "" .
"" They have stolen it already .
They are doing it electronically –
it is just a matter of picking a number .
At first , they were saying it would be 90 % for Karzai , but now they are trying to bring it back down to 60 % . ""
Another option would be to offer Abdullah Abdullah , the second - place candidate , who claims Mr Karzai has "" rigged "" the election , a power - sharing deal .
Dr Abdullah was made such offers in the run - up to the election , however , and turned them down ."
2009-08-25,"The first results from Afghanistan 's presidential elections , announced today , gave the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , a slender lead over his main rival .
Afghanistan 's independent election commission ( IEC ) said Karzai had won 41 % of the ballots processed so far , while his former finance minister , Abdullah Abdullah , had won 39 % .
Karzai must win more than half the available votes to triumph outright without the need for a second round of voting between him and Abdullah in October .
Election experts said today 's results did not give a clear indication of whether the country was heading for a second round of voting , because they were based on only 10 % of votes cast .
Results from the south – where Karzai is thought to enjoy strong support and where most reports of ballot rigging have come from – will be released over the coming days .
Security in the south is precarious , making it hard to count the ballot papers .
The fragile situation was underlined today when at least 40 people were killed and 66 injured in a series of car bombings in Kandahar .
Officials said five vehicles filled with explosives were blown up simultaneously in an attack that appeared to target a Japanese construction company that employs engineers from Pakistan .
Martine van Bijlert , the co - director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network , warned that the small sample of votes that had been counted "" does n't really tell us anything "" .
"" When the sample is bigger , you can try to extrapolate –
but now it is too early , "" she said .
"" But even then results will still vary , depending on which provinces have been counted most on that particular day , who had the strongest showing there , how many votes does the province represent . ""
Most of the provinces in which large percentages of votes have been processed and included in the national tally appear to be those in central regions and the north , the IEC figures showed .
Data suggests about 5.5 million Afghans voted last Thursday , down on the figures for the 2004 presidential election , which saw 8.1 million cast their votes .
Van Bijlert said allegations of vote - rigging and multiple voting cast doubt on the data .
"" We will probably be able to get a better sense of the plausibility of the figures once we have more detail . ""
Allegations of fraud by the leading candidates are threatening to destroy public confidence in the legitimacy of the election .
Yesterday , Abdullah hosted a press conference at his house in Kabul during which he brandished ballot papers he said had been pre - marked in Karzai 's favour .
He also showed voting papers cast for him , which he said had been removed from the count , and photos showing local officials overseeing polling in some provinces .
"" We will not allow big fraud to decide the outcome of the election , "" he said .
There is no reason to doubt that state facilities have been used to engineer very big , widespread fraud . ""
He promised to pursue "" all legal means to prevent big fraud deciding the results or our election "" .
Abdullah also insisted he would not strike a power - sharing deal with Karzai – a widely rumoured option that may gain support with the west anxious to avoid a political crisis in Afghanistan ."
2009-08-26,"Hamid Karzai extended his lead in Afghanistan 's presidential election today as the British ambassador to Kabul warned fraud and vote rigging could determine the outcome of last week 's vote .
Figures released today show that after the votes from 17 % of Afghanistan 's polling stations have been counted Karzai 's slender lead over his main rival , Abdullah Abdullah , has increased .
It now stands at 44.8 % to 35.1 % .
The Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) plans to give daily updates on the progress of the count , with a preliminary result expected between 3 and 7 September .
A final result is expected around 17 September .
Karzai must win more than half the votes cast to triumph outright and avoid a second round of voting between him and Abdullah in October .
Speaking via video link from Kabul , the British ambassador , Mark Sedwill , said the authorities were investigating 200 allegations of electoral fraud , "" 35 to 40 "" of which could be "" material to the outcome "" if upheld .
He defended coalition efforts to provide security leading up to polling day after it was reported that as few as 150 people voted in an area which was the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting for British troops .
He said it was too early to know how many people went to the dozen polling stations in the area between Lashkar Gah and Gereshk but admitted that some Afghans had travelled to more secure regions to cast their votes .
"" There is some evidence , but it is only anecdotal , that people from outlying areas travelled into more secure areas like Lashkar Gah in order to vote because they felt more confident in doing so .
We do n't yet know the extent to which people moved around . ""
Officials insist it is too early to predict the outcome of the election , but Sedwill said it would be considered a success if the result reflected the will of the people and gave the winner a genuinely national mandate . ""
That 's the test we have always set , rather than focusing on individual elements of the process or the inevitable irregularities that we know would happen across the country . ""
But he admitted polling day had been extremely violent , with about 400 reported attacks , and that Taliban intimidation had an impact on the turnout . ""
The insurrection is spreading and has spread since 2006 . ""
He added : "" We expected the intimidation … would have some effect and clearly it did . """
2009-08-27,"The BBC 's Afghan desk recently asked the three leading candidates of the presidential election the following question : "" What would you do , if you were to lose the election ? ""
All three – Hamid Karzai , Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani , – came up with the standard response : "" We would respect the people 's verdict . ""
In other words , Afghanistan is now a democracy ruled by the will of the people .
Such humble words delivered with humility are just what 's expected from politicians of developing countries whose survival relies mainly on foreign aid .
In the motto of the benevolent international community : no ballot , no aid .
Or in the case of Afghanistan , no pots of paint flown specially from Dubai to decorate the president 's office .
Be that as it may , the truth is that not all Afghans have been able to deliver their verdict in this election .
The Taliban , who in contrast to the mavericks in Kabul are sticking to the traditional bullet - not - ballot style of governance , successfully managed to frighten the people in the south into non - participation .
Although small voter turnout was expected in the restive south , the people were not free from threat even in relatively calmer regions .
In Herat , the local strongman Yahya Akbari reportedly threatened to fire rockets if the people dared to venture out and greet Karzai on his campaign trip to their city .
In sum , the security that is an absolute must for a fair election was not felt even in relatively calmer regions of Afghanistan .
It is this condition of high risk for questionable reward that is making many Afghans wonder whether the 2009 election was an exercise in true democracy .
Be that as it may , Afghan and international observers were quick to point out that the fact that at least 35 % of the population ventured out to cast their votes in spite of threats of violence shows that ordinary Afghans have matured politically and a democratic culture is taking root in the country .
A comparison between the conditions in the 2004 and 2009 elections explains this view .
In contrast to 2004 , when the public mood was optimistic ; the Taliban were on the run and the neighbouring countries Iran and Pakistan were well disposed towards Kabul , voters this year had little reason to believe in democracy , let alone risk their lives to cast their votes .
After all , 2009 turned out to be a much more violent year , with Taliban attacks reaching the heart of the capital and the Kabul administration and its international allies having lost credibility both in terms of delivering peace or improving the people 's living conditions .
And yet millions of Afghans risked their lives , ventured out and cast their votes fully aware that voting meant taking a serious risk and knowing very well that the election would be fraudulent and the candidates most probably either lying or making empty promises .
Afghan and international observers celebrate this as evidence that Afghanistan has moved forward and is no longer an essentially tribal society upon whom the West has imposed democracy by sheer force of military .
In brief , a success story .
The recently published preliminary results based on a random sample of one million votes tell a different story .
According to the sample , the people 's verdict has given rise to two leaders , Karzai closely followed by Abdullah Abdullah .
In other words , a Pashtun leader followed closely by a half - Tajik leader with a majority Tajik support base .
This is what analysts call "" identity voting "" .
The preliminary results show that Karzai 's attempt at nation - building has failed and most Afghans ' loyalty lies first with their ethnic group , and then the nation as a whole .
Karzai 's critics have repeatedly pointed out that his nation - building attempts have been largely superficial , consisting on throwing dinner parties for discredited leaders of ethnic and religious minority groups .
In the words of presidential candidate Ramazan Bashardost , making a Hazara leader sit next to nomadic Pashtun leader at dinner is not exactly nation - building .
The many mass graves scattered around the country bear witness to the ethnic rivalries that followed the Soviet army 's withdrawal from Afghanistan and led to the civil wars of the early 1990s .
During the presidential election campaign , ex - Taliban commander turned candidate Mullah Rocketi was the only contender to openly admit that ethnic mistrust was the only reason why Afghans so easily became tools in the service of foreign powers and hence carried on fighting .
Nation - building has a long way to go in Afghanistan but as economist Paul Collier argues , leaders must build a nation before they can build a state .
This pattern of identity voting is the natural outcome of the ethnicised politics that has thrived over the last three decades .
And ethnicised politics creates lazy politicians who are automatically given support by members of their ethnic communities regardless of their performance , personal integrity or even education .
The fact that voters in Afghanistan have opted for identity voting shows that the idea of the state as a service provider has still not taken root in Afghanistan and ethnic loyalties override loyalty to Afghanistan as a whole .
To put it bluntly , apart from a small group of educated young people , most Afghans have n't moved on from the ethnicised politics that led to the civil wars of the early 1990s .
The only difference between then and now is that ballots are used instead of bullets .
But this , in itself , is a kind of progress ."
2009-08-28,"The US special envoy to Afghanistan , Richard Holbrooke , had a heated row with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , in the aftermath of the election , according to reports .
Sources described the meeting as "" a dramatic bust up "" and "" explosive "" , according to the BBC .
Holbrooke is said to have challenged Karzai over allegations of ballot - stuffing and fraud and suggested that a run - off to decide the next president – which would be held if no candidate obtained more than 50 % of the votes – would boost the credibility of the democratic process .
Karzai reportedly reacted angrily to Holbrooke 's criticisms , which also focused on deals struck by the incumbent president with warlords in a bid to garner support before the election .
The tense meeting , held on the day after the poll , was said to have been noticeably briefer than a discussion Holbrooke held with Karzai 's main rival for president , Abdullah Abdullah .
Abdullah and international observers have been critical of the conduct of the vote .
Britain 's ambassador , Mark Sedwill , said on Wednesday that the authorities were investigating 200 allegations of electoral fraud , 35 to 40 of which could be "" material to the outcome "" if upheld .
With 17 % of the votes counted , Karzai had 45 % of the votes compared with Abdullah 's 35 % , according to the official election commission .
The final election result is not expected until 17 September , with a preliminary result expected between 3 and 7 September .
A spokesman for the US embassy in Kabul rejected reports that there had been shouting , or that Holbrooke had stormed out of the meeting .
A spokesman for the presidential palace also denied that there had been a row .
Relations between the US and Afghanistan have been strained since Barack Obama entered the White House .
Senior figures in Washington have criticised the alleged incompetence and corruption of Karzai 's administration , while Karzai has hit back by insisting he is not a puppet of the international community .
US plans to push for a western - style chief executive to work under the president are seen as reflecting a lack of faith in the ability of whoever wins the election to curb corruption and extend the influence of the Kabul government in the face of Taliban advances ."
2009-08-28,"The new military head of the British army promised today to combine a firm focus on the Afghan campaign with renewed efforts to look after "" the army 's most valuable assets "" – its soldiers and their families .
General Sir David Richards , a former head of the international force fighting in Afghanistan who is close to its beleaguered president , Hamid Karzai , today formally succeeded General Sir Richard Dannatt , whose outspoken criticisms of equipment shortages has put him at loggerheads with Gordon Brown 's ministers .
Richards , who admitted that Dannatt would be a "" hard act to follow "" , is thought to share his misgivings about the persistent overstretch in the military budget arising from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It has led to shortages of kit – now largely rectified , ministers insist – but also had an impact on living quarters at a time when army families face the uncertainties of heavy casualties far from home .
"" In a squeeze the army always chooses extra kit over improving its housing stock , though we have done a lot , "" one Labour ex - defence minister said this week .
The army counters that , as chancellor , Gordon Brown refused to fund his own government 's widely - admired 1998 strategic defence review (
SDR)– and is unsympathetic to the armed forces .
The new chief of the general staff , Richards , 57 , an artillery officer by background , is expected to pick his way more delicately than Dannatt did through the minefields of policy and equipment priorities – where the shortage of funds has exacerbated traditional rivalries between the three services .
"" As part of the defence team , I will continue to focus on what is needed to meet the government 's aims in Afghanistan and the region , and ensuring the army achieves the tasks laid upon it , "" he said today .
"" The army 's most valuable assets are its people : it is essential that we continue to look after our soldiers and their families , especially those injured or affected adversely through conflict , "" the general added .
One of the main challenges he will face in Whitehall is the upcoming SDR as the navy and RAF seek to protect their share of the military budget from the urgent needs of the army .
All three main parties are pledged to review priorities – but only after the coming election , which the pro - defence Conservatives are expected to win .
But even they know they face severe budgetary constraints which have prompted some Tories to suggest they must make a major strategic sacrifice , perhaps even cancelling the Trident nuclear upgrade , and stretching the life of existing submarines .
Richards said : "" Looking to the longer term , I will be focusing on making sure that the army is geared up for future conflict as it evolves in this highly interdependent and globalised era . ""
John Hutton , Labour 's last defence secretary , commissioned Bernard Gray , a former MoD adviser and co - author of the 1998 SDR , to examine defence procurement – the equipment orders on which much of Britain 's remaining hi - tech industries depend .
But his successor , Bob Ainsworth , has not yet published it , leaking to speculation that it is too embarrassing for a government 12 years in office and to leaks of its contents .
They have shown that familiar complaints about bad decisions and cost overruns – familiar to all armies – have not been cured .
In particular it has emerged that a vital order of Chinook helicopters , central to force protection in Afghanistan , has been grounded for years because of costly procurement errors .
The problems long pre - date Labour , but as the Northern Ireland conflict unwound – freeing up troops –
Labour has engaged in military interventions in Europe , Africa and Asia unknown since the 1960s .
Dannatt , who will acquire a new pulpit as chairman of Whitehall 's military thinktank , the Royal United Services Institute , used his last official speech to urge that the SDR focus on the current campaign in Afghanistan the point also made by Richards .
Dannatt said : "" We must have what we absolutely need for the short - term and limit our ambitions for the medium and the long - term to what we can afford . ""
Behind such generalisations lies the concern of strategists as to whether such "" hybrid "" conflicts – part conventional warfare and part counterinsurgency – are the wars of the foreseeable future or aberrations .
Strategic equipment misjudgments in the past have led to major disasters as wars took unexpected directions –
Hitler 's innovative use of tanks in 1939 - 40 being a notorious example .
In a farewell message to his troops , Dannatt said : "" It has been a tremendous honour and privilege and a deeply humbling experience to lead you all for the past few years – you are truly outstanding people .
As I march into the military sunset I do so confident that the army 's determination , professionalism and reputation remains where it should be : second to none . ""
Military gossip has suggested that , for all today 's friendly handover , Dannatt , a heavy infantry officer , did not approve of an artillery officer taking over the top seat – and did his best to block Richards 's promotion ."
2009-09-02,"Britain is coming under pressure to back a risky and potentially violent run - off in the Afghan elections because of evidence of vote - rigging and fraud that has led critics to claim the results are unreliable .
The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , senior Tories , and members of the foreign affairs select committee , said the scale of the fraud would make it impossible to believe that a Hamid Karzai election victory was fair , or that the results would be seen as legitimate in Afghanistan .
The Afghan Independent Election Commission , whose chief is a Karzai appointee , is due to announce the election result on 17 September .
Downing Street said today that Gordon Brown was unlikely to express his view on the election 's validity in a speech he is due to make on Afghanistan on Friday in the wake of his visit to the country last weekend and the review being prepared by the US commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal .
The prime minister has suggested that the election be seen in the context of the violent disruption caused by Taliban fighters .
He is expected to promise to help double the number of trained Afghan soldiers and to set great store by the appointment of 400 independently appointed district and provincial governors to act as a counterweight to Taliban justice .
Richard Holbrooke , the US special envoy , has not stated whether there should be a fresh poll but is reported to have the support of the French , Germans and British for a run - off between President Karzai and his chief challenger , Abdullah Abdullah , if the results are not clear .
A second ballot is required if no candidate secures more than 50 % of the vote .
Figures show Karzai is creeping up to the 50 % threshold ; the commission reported today that he had won 47.3 % of the vote , while Abdullah had 32.6 % .
More than 60 % of the vote had been counted .
Ed Davey , the Lib Dems ' foreign affairs spokesman , who has called for a poll run - off , said : "" No one expected western - style elections .
but the scale of fraud seems so large , and the likely margin of Karzai 's victory so small , that these results can not be safely seen as a victory for Karzai .
If Karzai is confident he has won in the first round by fair means he should have nothing to fear from a second round of voting that can ensure the winner has the support of the people of Afghanistan . ""
Davey said it would make sense for any run - off to be conducted jointly with the UN , as the elections had been in 2004 .
Greg Pope , a Labour member of the foreign affairs select committee , said : "" The point of British forces being in Afghanistan is that there is a free , stable , and democratic country . ""
Conservative sources said they were disturbed by the fraud claims .
One Tory said : "" A narrow Karzai victory in which he claims more than 50 % of a bogus vote is the worst of all worlds . """
2009-09-07,"Hopes that a successful Afghan presidential election would assist western efforts to secure , stabilise and develop the country recede with every percentage point that is added to Hamid Karzai 's tally .
Karzai is said to have obtained 48.6 % of the vote against 31.7 % for his nearest rival with about 25 % of ballots still to count .
Only a small miracle or a massive counter - fraud can now stop him surpassing the 50 % threshold required for re - election .
Karzai 's looming "" victory "" is viewed with gloom in western capitals .
It is believed , and not only by his opponents , to have been achieved via blatant , systematic , indefensible vote - rigging , bribery and intimidation .
It was already tainted by pre - poll pacts between Karzai and notorious warlords and drug - traffickers .
It was facilitated by the collusion of corrupt provincial officials afraid of losing their jobs .
And it followed US and British failure to find a viable alternative candidate , or to install an Afghan "" chief executive "" or a western diplomatic satrap , to curb Karzai 's powers .
The election debacle has thus increased , rather than eased , the crushing weight of intractable problems besetting western policymakers and soldiers struggling to make sense of Afghanistan .
These difficulties are approaching critical mass as civilian deaths continue , western casualties mount and public support slides .
Notwithstanding Gordon Brown 's Afghan plan , enunciated last Friday , pressing decisions about what to do next , and how , will be made in the Oval Office , not Downing Street .
Barack Obama faces no shortage of advice , primarily from his top Afghan commander , General Stanley McChrystal , who has been reviewing strategy .
McChrystal 's broad conclusions – giving priority to protecting the Afghan people and enhancing government and civilian capacity – have already been leaked .
Decisions on more specific proposals , such as raising US troop levels by 40 - 45,000 to well over 100,000 and pushing for more Nato troops , too , are now imminent .
Raising force levels again ( he already sent an extra 21,000 earlier this year ) represents an enormous political risk for Obama and one he is not in particularly good shape to take .
His approval ratings have fallen faster than any first term president since Gerald Ford , he faces increasing resistance to his domestic agenda , notably healthcare reform , and the Afghan imbroglio is being recast by conservatives as Obama 's "" war of choice "" rather than the "" war of necessity "" that he describes .
As in Britain , there is no consensus over war aims : is it self - defence , is it democracy promotion , is it nation - building , or is it about smashing the heroin trade ?
Few seem to agree .
Among US allies there is diminishing appetite for the fight ; it has become a divisive election issue in Germany while Japan 's new government has pledged to end its involvement .
On top of that , Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs , and defence secretary Robert Gates freely admit time is running short to turn things around .
Congressional Democrats , mindful of next year 's mid - term polls , heartily agree .
Speaking last week , Mullen suggested the worsening security situation in Afghanistan must be reversed within the next 12 to 18 months or else the game would be up .
"" I think it is serious and it is deteriorating and I 've said over the last couple of years that the Taliban insurgency has gotten better , more sophisticated , "" Mullen said .
He spoke after a Washington Post - ABC News poll found most Americans felt the war was not worth fighting .
Yet another international conference on Afghanistan , as proposed by Brown and Germany 's Angela Merkel , is unlikely to change this dynamic .
Amid myriad solicited and unsolicited suggestions , Obama 's choice boils down to two options : take full ownership of the war and dig in for the long haul , or lower one 's sights and walk away as quick as is decent .
Opinions about which way he should jump vary hugely .
George Will , honorary archdeacon of American conservative columnists , surprised his fans last week by advocating retreat .
Washington should wash its hands of a country where travelling around is "" like walking through the Old Testament "" , he said .
"" Forces should be substantially reduced to serve a comprehensively reviewed policy : America should do only what can be done from offshore , using intelligence , drones , cruise missiles , air strikes and small , potent special forces units , concentrating on the porous 1,500 mile border with Pakistan , a nation that actually matters . ""
Will 's offshore strategy
ignored the fact that Afghanistan is landlocked –
but it was clear what he meant .
Others urge Obama to roll his sleeves up and get stuck in .
"" Is winning in Afghanistan in the US vital national interest ?
I believe it is , "" said Thomas McClanahan in the Kansas City Star .
"" Pulling out would hand the jihadists a triumph and once again open up Afghanistan as a launching pad for terrorist strikes . ""
Bruce Riedel , an Obama adviser , and Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution were at pains in the Wall Street Journal to emphasise western achievements , including economic growth and falling support for the Taliban , that they said should not be lightly squandered .
Just how high Afghanistan still stands in American consciousness , and why , was illustrated by a timely Chicago Tribune editorial .
It complained Obama had not "" spent enough time reminding Americans that an Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban and al - Qaida would regain its role as a terrorism hatchery "" .
September would be crucial for the US debate on what to do , it added .
"" As that plays out , none of us should forget how that lawless country tolerated the development of one particularly heinous terror plot .
It came to fruition eight years ago this week , on the 11th of the month . """
2009-09-08,"Hamid Karzai has passed the crucial 50 % threshold in Afghanistan 's troubled presidential election with almost all the votes counted , according to new figures released today , but a partial recount has been ordered after observers found "" clear and convincing evidence of fraud "" at a number of polling stations .
The results , announced by the Independent Election Commission , gave Karzai 54.1 % , with results from 91.6 % of polling stations counted .
His main rival Abdullah Abdullah has secured 28.3 % of the vote .
The results push Karzai past the 50 % mark that he needs to secure victory without a run - off , but the commission has set aside the results from 600 polling stations where vote - rigging is suspected .
The results will not be officially certified until late September , after fraud allegations in Ghazni , Paktika and Kandahar provinces have been investigated .
The commission , which comprises three international members appointed by the UN and two Afghans , said recounts would be conducted at polling stations recording 100 % turnout or votes for any presidential candidate of more than 95 % .
Earlier it announced that about 200,000 ballots had been rejected because of fraud , but the UN called for further measures to counter widespread vote - rigging in the poll .
Daoud Ali Najafi , the commission 's chief electoral officer , said : "" The numbers were suspicious and the results did not match with the reconciliation form [ used to double - check results ] "" .
He added : "" In some areas the turnout was higher than the number of ballots we sent to the polling station . ""
As doubts grow about the legitimacy of the poll , the UN 's chief representative in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , has called on Afghan election officials to exclude all ballots that have "" evidence of irregularities "" from the vote count .
More than 650 major fraud charges have been lodged since the vote on 20 August .
There could be as many one million fraudulent votes in the poll , western officials told the US broadcaster ABC News .
It reported that the UN and US summoned Karzai to an emergency meeting to object to the count of "" knowingly "" fraudulent votes .
A senior western diplomat told Associated Press that most of the votes in Kandahar , Paktika and Khost were fraudulent .
Partial returns from each of those provinces heavily favour Karzai .
Others have said tallies came in from as many as 800 fake polling sites .
Najafi said it was unlikely that 800 polling stations were faked , and said the most recent number of fraud - annulled stations he had was the 447 announced at the weekend ."
2009-09-08,"Hamid Karzai yesterday won the Afghan election , except that he did n't .
He was credited with substantially more than the 50 % of the votes he needs in order to be deemed to have won in the first round , but the electoral complaints process is at the same time stripping him of votes and could end , perhaps after many weeks , by knocking him back below the halfway mark .
The dilemma for Barack Obama and other western leaders is that they could soon face a choice between being complicit in a deeply flawed election or embarking on the dangerous and difficult course of forcing a second round .
If the Electoral Complaints Commission gets the backing and resources needed to fully investigate fraud allegations , something which the outside powers can either ensure or choose to neglect , a second round will almost certainly be the result .
When America and its allies began to scrape together the extra troops and money needed to conduct a presidential election in Afghanistan , they knew in advance it would be something of a charade .
They had succeeded neither in persuading Hamid Karzai to reform his way of governing nor in cultivating politicians from whose ranks a different sort of leader could have emerged to challenge him .
Mr Karzai , by using his network of warlord governors , buying up some northern bosses , and drawing on his natural supporters in the south of the country , would prevail in the vote .
His rivals would flail away but had no real chance even if there was a second round .
The result would be a very expensive foregone conclusion , and the best the outside powers could hope for was to somehow get through it without too much trouble .
Then , having performed the necessary , and cursory , obeisance to democratic procedures , they could get on with the war along the lines being plotted by America 's new generals and diplomats in the region , tackling Mr Karzai and his many faults afterwards .
Their mistake was that , while they expected the voters to be squared , bribed , pressured and marshalled to the polls by local chieftains , they did not expect barefaced rigging and ballot box stuffing on the scale which now seems to have occurred .
"" This was fraud en masse , "" one western diplomat told the New York Times , alleging that Mr Karzai 's men set up hundreds of fictitious polling stations which registered hundreds of thousands of ballots in his favour .
He and other western diplomats and officials also said that the Karzai organisers took over around 800 legitimate stations , kept out citizens and stuffed boxes with fake votes .
The elders of one tribal grouping told reporters how they had decided to support Abdullah Abdullah , Mr Karzai 's main rival , but when they arrived at the polling station they found it locked and officials inside filling the boxes with "" their "" votes , all for Mr Karzai .
The fraud was so ham - handed that in some provinces the number of votes registered for Mr Karzai was 10 times as many as those who actually voted , whether for Mr Karzai or any of the other candidates .
The Electoral Complaints Commission yesterday discarded 200,000 votes as too dubious to be counted .
The trouble is that although more international oversight might limit fraud a second time around , Mr Karzai would still almost certainly win , since few believe that the Pashtun population will vote in any numbers for Abdullah Abdullah , a candidate they regard as a Tajik , in spite of the fact that he is half Pashtun .
The most fundamental problem of all is that Mr Karzai could have won without any rigging at all .
But he apparently could not bring himself to trust the people or the democratic system to which he is in theory committed .
As a matter of principle the outside powers should press for the most thorough investigation of fraud and for a second round if need be .
But , with or without that second round , it has to be unhappily concluded that this election has made things worse rather than better in Afghanistan ."
2009-09-09,"Afghanistan 's position as the frontline state in the battle against global terrorism and the international observation of its second presidential poll made that election an international event .
Voting is the test of legitimacy , which is why some politicians try to rig it .
Hamid Karzai 's chances of being elected president through what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights terms as "" genuine elections "" were good ; his "" victory - through - fraud "" shows that he has n't learned the basic international democratic norms since he was first voted in in 2004 .
As "" extra "" votes , cast by nonexistent people , were being counted , Karzai shrugged off American allegations of fraud , accusing the US of wanting a puppet ruler .
But as the UN provided evidence of massive electoral fraud – Karzai won a large number of votes in fake polling stations –
he declared that fraud was inevitable in nascent democracies .
That only shows contempt for his countrymen who braved Taliban violence and the threat of severed fingers in the hope of exercising their human right to freely elect their rulers and increase their life choices .
To pursue the war against the Taliban , Karzai needed to increase his own and his government 's legitimacy .
The legitimacy and stability of his government , already tainted by five years of misgovernance and widespread corruption , has been put at greater risk by these rigged elections .
That could deepen the political rifts in war - torn Afghanistan : some Afghans may never accept the results , and the brutal Taliban will have another stick with which to attack Karzai and exacerbate insecurity .
The west is caught in a bind .
To continue to support a dubious winner , the head of a government so corrupt that reconstruction work is paralysed , could fuel the growing sense of injustice among Afghans , and block the path to political participation and reconciliation .
The rigged election will not convince citizens of western democracies that their countries should contribute more troops to shore Karzai up or to bestow more humanitarian largesse on an establishment infested with drug traffickers and warlords .
But establishing the scale of electoral rigging could take months and , if the international community deems a second round of polling necessary , it would not only have to find a way of preventing another fake election , but be prepared for an even more bitter and divisive one .
Perhaps most difficult of all , it would have to concentrate security efforts on ensuring that the conduct and results of the second round were more credible than the first .
Would it be prudent to carry on with a leader politically crippled by dishonesty , or to acknowledge and investigate the flaws of the election and , if necessary , to throw weight behind another round of ruthless electoral competition ?
Karzai 's flawed success will disappoint Afghans and all those around the world who would like to see terrorism defeated ."
2009-09-15,"Ballots from about a tenth of Afghanistan 's polling stations are to be recounted after evidence surfaced of widespread fraud , possibly forcing President Hamid Karzai to face another round of voting .
News of the recount came as a bitter split emerged inside the international community today over how to deal with the election debacle .
The split led to the abrupt departure of the top American official in the United Nations mission , Peter Galbraith , who had pushed for a more aggressive response to vote - rigging than that pursued by his boss , the Norwegian head of the mission , Kai Eide .
The personal split , following a head to head row over the UN 's strategy , mirrors a wide difference of opinion among troop - contributing nations involved in the war , over how to deal with overwhelming evidence of fraud committed by a government their soldiers are fighting to maintain .
After a meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels , the German minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier said : "" We will press for an investigation of all fraud allegations .
It is important that the elected president is recognised and respected by the entire population of Afghanistan . ""
With over 90 % of the votes counted from the first round on 20 August , Karzai leads with 54 % of the vote against 28 % by his closest challenger , Abdullah Abdullah .
Today it was announced that a ruling by the UN - backed Election Complaints Commission meant that votes from 2,500 polling stations out of a total of 26,300 , would have to be recounted .
It was unclear how votes would be affected , but it raised the possibility that Karzai 's total could diminish to below 50 % , in which case he would have to fight a second round against Abdullah .
However , the recount is likely to take weeks and might not be completed until the onset of the Afghan winter in the mountain provinces , making a second round impractical .
Nato officials say they are confident a resolution will be found , but the sudden departure of Galbraith underlined the disagreements and anxiety within the international community in Kabul .
The UN spokesman there , Aleem Siddique , said Galbraith was "" currently on mission to New York "" . ""
Peter Galbraith remains an integral part of the UN mission leadership , both Mr Galbraith and Mr Eide are committed to supporting a credible election outcome .
In any hotly contested election there are bound to de differences of opinion .
However , on the issue of these elections , both the UN envoy and his deputy are united in ensuring a credible outcome for Afghan 's voters , "" Siddique said .
Diplomats said Galbraith had been the target of withering criticism from the Karzai government and some of the Afghan press , for his outspoken style and his insistence that the ECC , which is made up of three foreign and two Afghan commissioners , should take an aggressive approach towards the Afghan - run Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) .
Eide has insisted the IEC take the lead , for fear of giving the impression the process was being dictated by foreigners .
Siddique said the two men remained in close touch and would meet up at the end of the month to report to the UN in New York ."
2009-09-16,"Afghan election officials have begun logistical preparations for a second round of voting to determine the controversial presidential election marred by allegations of large - scale rigging in favour of Hamid Karzai , it emerged today .
The second round will take place in five weeks only if Karzai 's share of the vote – which currently stands at 54 % – falls to less than 50 % .
With 10 % of ballots currently under scrutiny , that scenario appears increasingly likely .
Karzai 's team today dismissed EU claims of fraud , after Phillippe Morillon , head of the EU election monitoring mission , said 1.1 m of about 3 m votes cast for Karzai were suspect . ""
Hamid Karzai 's election campaign team believes today 's announcement of the number of suspected votes by the head and deputy head of EU election monitoring commission is partial , irresponsible and in contradiction with Afghanistan 's constitution , "" his campaign office said in a statement .
A senior western official said that the Afghan independent election commission had "" pencilled in "" a run - off vote for the third week of October , despite earlier predictions that a fresh poll would be impossible before the onset of the harsh Afghan winter .
The IEC has ordered new ballots from the UK and new stocks of indelible ink , used to stain voters ' fingers , from Canada , according to the official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
But an exact date has not been set .
A second vote could resolve a tense dispute with Karzai 's main presidential rival , Abdullah Abdullah , who claims the 20 August poll was rigged .
Results so far give Abdullah 28 % support .
But it would also be expensive and dangerous , disinfranchising Afghan voters in remote snowbound provinces .
By the third week of October parts of northern Badakhshan and eastern Nuristan provinces are likely to be inaccessible because of heavy snowfall .
There would be a risk of further Taliban violence .
In the last round , a small number of voters had their fingers chopped off after casting their ballot .
The authorities would also have to recruit new staff in areas with a history of proven vote - rigging .
"" It could be a nightmare .
On top of the security problem of further Taliban attacks , some areas will be left out of the vote , "" the western official said .
So far , 93 % of votes have been counted .
The independent election commission is expected to release a full preliminary tally later today , , but the UN - backed electoral complaints commission ( ECC ) , which adjudicates disputes , has quarantined votes from 2,500 of the country 's 26,300 polling stations .
The ECC has already thrown out votes from 83 stations , mostly in areas in which Karzai won , in some cases scoring 100 % of votes cast with a 100 % turnout .
EU election observers say 27 % of results published so far indicate fraud .
Despite the potential difficulties , many see an imperfect second round as preferable to a long winter of perilous limbo .
Alternatively , a second round could be averted if Karzai and Abdullah were to strike a power - sharing deal , but neither so far appears inclined to compromise .
The fraud controversy has split the UN mission to Kabul , whose American deputy head , Peter Galbraith , has left for New York following a dispute with his Norwegian boss , Kai Eide . ""
In any hotly - contested election , there are bound to be differences of opinion .
But Peter and Kai remain committed to the election process , "" a spokesman for the mission , Aleem Siddiqui , said .
The row is thought to centre on the UN 's public stance on fraud allegations , with Galbraith favouring aggressive criticism while Eide advocates a "" behind the scenes "" approach .
One UN insider said the argument had divided opinion inside the mission , reflecting a wider split over the poll .
"" There 's a heated debate in lots of embassies , "" the insider said .
"" The difference is that ours has come into the open . ""
The debates in Kabul came as the Ministry of Defence announced that two British soldiers had died yesterday after they were fatally wounded in separate explosions in southern Afghanistan .
A soldier from 2nd Battalion
The Rifles was killed when he was caught in a blast while on foot patrol in Helmand and a second soldier , from 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , died in hospital in the UK after being injured in an explosion in the north - west of Helmand on Saturday .
A total of 216 British troops have died in Afghanistan since the start of operations in October 2001 ."
2009-09-16,"Afghan election officials were preparing for a possible second round of voting in five weeks ' time to decide Afghanistan 's controversial presidential election , even as President Hamid Karzai appeared to be cruising towards victory .
The first full preliminary results were released giving Karzai 54.6 % of the votes , against 27.7 % for his main challenger , Abdullah Abdullah .
A Karzai spokesman said it would take a "" miracle "" for his candidate to lose .
But election officials are scrutinising 10 % of ballots for possible fraud , mostly in areas where Karzai performed strongly .
A European Union team said that up to one quarter of votes could be tainted .
If the recount pushes Karzai 's share below 50 % the contest will go to a second round .
A senior western official said that the Afghan independent election commission had pencilled in a run - off vote for the third week of October , confounding earlier predictions that a fresh poll was impossible before the onset of the harsh Afghan winter .
The IEC has ordered fresh ballots from England and new stocks of indelible ink , which is used to stain voters ' fingers , from Canada , the official said , on condition of anonymity .
An exact date has not been set .
A fresh vote could pacify Abdullah , who claims Karzai manipulated state machinery to rig the election , and assuage the fears of western allies who want to avoid association with a potentially explosive result .
But a new poll would also be expensive and dangerous and would disenfranchise Afghan voters in remote northern and eastern provinces , which will be partially snowbound by late October .
"" It could be a nightmare .
On top of the security problem of further Taliban attacks , some areas will be left out of the vote , "" the western official said .
The month - long count has been overshadowed by allegations of fraud .
The UN - backed electoral complaints commission , which adjudicates disputes , has quarantined votes from 2,500 of the 26,300 polling stations .
Votes from 83 polling stations have already been thrown out , in some instances where Karzai won 100 % of the vote .
The most damning assessment came from the EU monitors , who estimated that 1.5 m of 5.6 m votes might be tainted by fraud .
Karzai 's office angrily rejected the claim , calling it "" partial , irresponsible and in contradiction with Afghanistan 's constitution "" .
Karzai 's team is hoping their majority will survive the recount .
If not , a second vote would ease the political impasse with Abdullah , whose supporters have threatened to demonstrate on the streets .
But it would also bring a host of fresh difficulties .
By the third week of October parts of northern Badakhshan and eastern Nuristan provinces would probably be inaccessible due to heavy snowfall .
There would be a risk of further Taliban violence – in the last round a small number of voters had their fingers chopped off after casting a ballot .
The authorities would also have to recruit new staff in areas with a history of proven rigging .
But western countries , including the US and Britain , are thought to prefer an imperfect October vote to a months - long political limbo as Afghans wait for the winter snows to thaw .
"" A second round next year is unacceptable to the international community .
They will move hell or high water to have it this year , "" the official said .
A second round could be averted if Karzai and Abdullah were to strike a power - sharing deal .
But so far neither candidate looks inclined to compromise .

2009-09-17,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has rebutted claims of widespread fraud in the disputed presidential election and insisted that the process remains credible .
"" It was n't that big .
If there was fraud , it was small – it happens all over the world , "" he told a news conference in Kabul one day after a provisional tally showed him in a strong lead with 54.6 % of votes .
"" I believe firmly , firmly in the integrity of the election and the integrity of the Afghan people , and the integrity of the government in that process , "" he said .
Karzai said he was "" surprised and rather shocked "" by the findings of an EU observer mission that one - quarter of the vote may have been rigged .
With his nearest rival , Abdullah Abdullah , commanding just 27.7 % of votes , Karzai looks on course to win .
But if a recount of 10 % of disputed votes erodes his lead below 50 % , a second round of voting will be necessary .

2009-09-23,"Amid a deepening divide in Washington over whether to send more troops to Afghanistan , the US military commander in Kabul , General Stanley McChrystal , has launched a new counterinsurgency strategy aimed at bolstering support for the Afghan government amid a growing recognition that the war will be lost without popular backing for the administration .
McChrystal is pulling back forces from thinly - populated outlying areas where some of the most intense fighting against the Taliban has taken place and is deploying them to defend major population centres from the Taliban .
US military and political strategy is increasingly focused on how to legitimise President Hamid Karzai 's government .
President Obama is holding off from committing more troops to Afghanistan amid wrangling between the military and politicians , and among the ruling Democrats , over whether McChrystal 's recent request for additional forces can turn the tide or will drag the US deeper in to a mire .
Obama has said that he will not send more soldiers until there is an effective counterinsurgency strategy in place and there is a general recognition that requires an Afghan government that has the support of the people .
McChrystal , in a report to the Pentagon leaked to the Washington Post this week , says that pervasive corruption and incompetence , along with the failure to protect the civilian population , has severely undermined confidence in the government .
That has been compounded by Karzai 's fraud - tainted re - election last month .
The former president , Bill Clinton , said this week that things are "" teetering "" in Afghanistan and that Obama would be wise to hold off from committing more troops until the question of the disputed presidential election is resolved .
In Kabul , a sense of deep gloom and foreboding about the future of western engagement has settled on many diplomats .
The diplomats say that the fiasco surrounding Afghanistan 's presidential election has , in the words of one official , "" destroyed Obama 's Afghanistan strategy at the first hurdle "" .
Karzai is also being blamed by many ordinary Afghans for unpopular Nato airstrikes in which civilians are killed . ""
In Afghanistan realities often drown out wishful thinking and the election has brought corruption and legitimacy to the forefront of concerns , "" says one of the city 's most experienced foreign observers .
"" All the options are bad , I simply ca n't see a way out . ""
McChrystal believes the tide can be turned by redeploying Nato troops to protect and interact with Afghans , so they are not seen as an occupation force , which will help bolster the government alongside cleaning up corruption and more effective administration .
Colonel James Helis of the US Army War College said that however the issue of troop deployments is resolved , it is crucial that a new counterinsurgency strategy focus on building support for the government .
"" One of the challenges we 've faced in Afghanistan over the years is under - resourcing , not just of troops but the overall effort .
That 's pretty well accepted now .
That policy 's shifting and that opens up the question : how do we now approach it ?
What 's a higher priority for more resources ?
"" he said .
"" Clearly in counterinsurgency one of your priorities is protecting the population and success is going to be reached when the population sides conclusively , firmly , with the government as opposed to the insurgents or being in a fence sitting mode .
If you 've got to protect the population you 've got to be interacting with , providing assistance to the population and to the government . ""
"" Winning the campaign means the government has earned the support of the people .
the people have chosen the government over the insurgents .
"" That 's a definition of success .
So part of the counterinsurgency campaign has got to be fulfilling the capacity of the government so it can provide services and protection to the populace , as well as building the credibility of the government . ""
Michael Semple , an influential former European diplomat expelled from Afghanistan in 2007 , said that the US became involved in state - building in the first place "" because without it , intervention in the country made no sense "" .
"" International security requires stability in Afghanistan .
Stability requires a basic effective government , in charge of its own security and with democratic mechanisms to give all Afghans a stake in the system . ""
These objectives are still worthwhile and attainable .
But progress will require a rethink of US political strategy .
While the US has been active militarily it has been passive politically , without a strategy to cope with crises like the election farce .
Progress in Afghanistan requires long - term commitment , backed up with more politics rather than more drones .
"" Opinion is divided in Washington .
Democratic leaders have come out against sending more troops to Afghanistan , saying there is no public support for the move and that the Afghan army must take up a greater share of the combat .
The vice - president , Joe Biden , has proposed a drawing down of the effort in Afghanistan because al - Qaida forces have now largely moved to Pakistan , saying the military 's focus should be there .
But the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , has warned that would open up Afghanistan to al - Qaida again .
One top Democrat has broken ranks with sceptics among the party 's leaders by warning Obama against half measures . ""
The last administration allowed itself to be distracted from the fight forced on us in Afghanistan by the fight it chose in Iraq , "" the chairman of the House armed services committee , Ike Skelton , said in a letter to the president .
"" I believe that this was a strategic mistake ... resulting in an approach of ' half - ass it and hope ' ...
We can not afford to continue that policy . ""
UN officials are acutely aware that public support among the country'ss main western backers is eroding .
Next week , at the UN security council in New York , the organisation 's special representative in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , will warn that the country can not rely on indefinite foreign support forever and that the next government will have to take urgent steps to crack down on corruption and deliver basic services to people in order to win back the support of both ordinary Afghans , but also western publics ."

But while McChrystal presses ahead with a new counterinsurgency strategy , the Pentagon said yesterday that his formal request for additional troops may have to be revised because of uncertainty within the Obama administration over whether to escalate the US commitment to the eight - year - long war .
The Pentagon press secretary , Geoff Morrell , said McChrystal 's detailed request will be delivered by the end of the week but he implied that the general may be forced to scale back the size of the additional forces because the White House is not prepared to approve as many as he wants .

2009-09-28,"The shaky footage shows two election monitors inspecting a book of 100 ballot papers that are still stitched together , as they were intended to arrive at the polling station in rural Afghanistan .
But something is wrong ; instead of being pristine , ready for the voter to make his or her mark , each paper bears a large blue tick next to the name of one candidate : Hamid Karzai .
As the monitors flick through the pad , the back of the ballots clearly show the authorisation stamp of election monitors , validating them as votes ready to be put in the ballot box and counted .
"" We found it the day after the elections , "" one of the monitors in the footage told me .
"" They were trying to put it in one of the [ ballot ] boxes but did n't have time , so we took it home and filmed it .
If we had given it back to the election committee they would have used it again , so we burned it , but filmed it to protect ourselves if they come and threaten us . ""
The video footage is just part of a picture of widespread fraud in the Afghan election uncovered by the Guardian .
On Thursday , President Karzai told a news conference : "" I believe firmly , firmly in the integrity of the election and the integrity of the Afghan people , and the integrity of the government in that process . ""
But evidence given by a number of officials and voters tells a very different story , one in which the selling of votes to presidential candidates was common and the idea of the election being fair was laughable .
I met a different official outside a Kabul juice bar , where he sat on the kerb with a look of defeat on his face , clutching a glass of squeezed pomegranate and wrapped by the blue fumes of kebab stalls and passing cars .
He showed me a series of photographs taken inside a brown cardboard voting booth in a village in Paktiya province of Afghanistan .
One shows a man marking a big pile of ballot papers in the name of Hamid Karzai .
Another shows a pile of election ID cards spread in front of an unidentified man wearing black shoes . ""
This man brought 120 cards and he used each of them to vote three times , "" said the official .
He had intended to hand his photographs to his superiors , he said , but as election day unfolded it became obvious that his superiors were themselves taking part in the fraud .
"" I thought I would give the pictures to the election committee .
But they were all working for Karzai . ""
Fearing he had been spotted taking the pictures , he fled to Kabul .
"" Everyone was cheating in my polling station .
Only 10 % voted , but they registered 100 % turnout .
One man brought five books of ballots , each containing 100 votes , and stuffed them in the boxes after the elections were over . ""
The election official came from the district of Ahmad Aba in Paktiya , an area of dusty hills framed by high , ragged mountains and typical Afghan hamlets with mud - walled compounds , cornfields and orchards .
I sat there with half a dozen men on an embankment in the shadow of willow and apple trees .
They were waiting for the Ramadan fast to pass , fumbling with their plastic prayer beads .
Boys sat in a bigger circle behind the men and behind them shoes , a prosthetic leg and flip - flops were stacked .
Haggling As the men relaxed and smilingly described the election day , it became clear that what would constitute large - scale fraud in western context meant little more to them than the usual haggling over chicken or vegetables in a market . ""
Election day was very good and very peaceful here , "" said one villager .
"" The security was very good .
It was a like a feast day . ""
"" Personally on polling day I put in 10 ballots , "" said another .
"" I took my voting card and the cards of the women in my family and went to the polling station .
No one said anything to me .
All the women 's votes were cast in this way .
"" Behind the embankment , the women and girls stood in a stream , washing clothes .
Another three were scrubbing the metal gate of a nearby compound , preparing for the end of Ramadan .
A man with a shiny black turban joined the circle .
Told what we were discussing , he laughed . ""
On polling day the people who did the cheating were the officials , "" he said .
"" They worked for the candidates . ""
His family had voted , he said , but the women had n't gone to the polling station .
Their ballots were sold to the candidates ' representatives .
"" Only four old women cast their votes . ""
The vote had come down to a battle of budgets , with agents for both Karzai and his rival , Abdullah Abdullah , giving money in exchange for votes . ""
The big tribal elders took lots of money from Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah .
They were supposed to distribute it , but they did n't give much to us , only 1,000 Afghani ( $ 20 ) , or a mobile phone card .
The elders took all the money . ""
The black turbaned man squinted mischievously . ""
Election day was a good day , "" he said .
"" We hope there is election every year . ""
The men laughed .
In a nearby hamlet I met a fresh - faced election monitor who said he was 25 but looked younger .
We squatted on the edge of a dusty field while he described how the fraud had worked in his village .
"" It was all cheating on election day , "" he said .
"" Each candidate had his men cheating for him in the polling station and they all knew the others were cheating .
Even I cheated , "" he said .
"" I did n't want to , but when I saw everyone cheating , I put 20 ballots in for Ashraf Ghani [ a former finance minister ] , and then I called all my friends in other villages and we collected more ballots for him . ""
In the beginning I thought of selling my 20 cards to Karzai or Abdullah , but then I said no , they have enough votes . ""
He showed me three identical voting cards with his name and picture .
"" It was so easy to get those , "" he said .
"" Karzai and Abdullah had their men in the polling station , but there was no one for [ Ghani ] , so we cheated for him .
He is a very educated man and with good strategy for Afghanistan .
Also we are all from his tribe in this area .
I tried to put my extra ballots in our polling station , but I had some enemies who tried to take my picture
so I went to another polling station and no one asked to ink my finger or anything
, they just said bring cards and put them in the box .
It was a very happy day . ""
Karzai 's men were paying 1,000 Afghani per family and Abdullah 's were paying 1,500 Afghani .
But many people took money from Abdullah and voted for Karzai anyway . ""
The election monitor insisted it was a "" democratic "" area , meaning only that they were not hostile to government .
They were educated and many worked in the government , but they had also worked in all previous governments .
Like many differences in Afghanistan , the cheating had run along ethnic lines .
In the villages , where people were predominantly Pashtun , they had generally cheated for Karzai , but in the provincial capital , Gardez , the mostly Tajik people had cheated for Abdullah Abdullah .
Violations I drove into Gardez to meet a third election monitor .
Shots rang out in the distance as we talked .
The Taliban and Afghan security forces were fighting on the outskirts , but in the market life was normal .
Street sellers shouted and trucks honked .
"" I was offered $ 2,500 by Abdullah 's team to work for them on election day , but I did n't , "" he said , describing a range of violations , from police ferrying voters so they could vote Karzai , to officials stuffing hundreds of ballots .
At Karzai 's election headquarters in Gardez , he saw the head of a group of Pashtun tribes who he knew had taken money from Karzai 's people .
The village elders each took between $ 8,000 and $ 10,000 , he said .
"" The election committee workers were very weak , so the representatives of each candidate took their ' own ' boxes and started counting them .
"" There was a commotion , and a green police truck pulled up , parading the spoils of a rare victory : the dusty , bloody bodies of two dead Talibs .
We stood and watched as soldiers posed in front of them , their colleagues snapping pictures with mobile phones .
A crowd gathered , and an Afghan officer in wraparound sunglasses began an impromptu victory speech .
We left them , and drove back to Kabul ."
2009-10-04,"A former senior United Nations diplomat in Kabul has made a scathing attack on the UN 's handling of Afghanistan 's disputed elections , claiming that almost one in three of the votes cast for president Hamid Karzai were fraudulent .
Peter Galbraith , the former deputy head of the UN mission in Afghanistan , singled out his former chief , Kai Eide , for criticism , saying he had deliberately played down the level of cheating in an election where , in one region , "" 10 times as many votes were recorded as voters actually cast "" .
Galbraith was sacked last week , after his disagreements with Eide , a Norwegian diplomat in charge of the UN mission , about how to deal with electoral fraud became public .
Galbraith said the extraordinary level of fraud in the August vote "" has handed the Taliban its greatest strategic victory in eight years of fighting the United States and its Afghan partners "" .
The election was a "" foreseeable train wreck "" , he said , with Eide standing idle as Afghan election authorities and ministers loyal to the president avoided taking steps that could have reduced massive fraud .
The forceful intervention via an opinion piece in Sunday 's Washington Post , came at an increasingly difficult time for the US - led war effort , beset by deteriorating security , mounting deaths and political uncertainty .
The US military suffered its deadliest day in more than a year on Saturday when eight American soldiers were killed in sustained attacks on eastern outposts .
Galbraith 's disclosure could torpedo what many diplomats in Kabul suspect is an attempt by Eide and the US to minimise controversy over fraud allegations , and to move quickly to declare Karzai re - elected president .
Opposition politicians , including Abdullah Abdullah , the second - placed candidate , who wants to see a run - off vote , have seized on remarks made by Galbraith since he was sacked by Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary general , last Wednesday .
On Saturday Abdullah accused Eide of "" giving a green card for fraud to determine the outcome of the election "" .
A war of words between Galbraith and the UN ( which has attempted to characterise the row as a "" personality dispute "" ) has been gradually escalating .
In a letter to Ban , leaked to the New York Times , Galbraith made devastating allegations against Eide , including the claim that the latter ordered him not to hand to election officials information which showed turnout had been tiny in the south , where the Taliban intimidation campaign against voters was most effective .
Galbraith also said Eide told him to stop lobbying for the elimination of "" ghost polling stations "" — voting centres too dangerous to actually open , but which nonetheless received ballot papers that could be filled out by corrupt officials .
His article in the Washington Post , "" What I Saw at the Afghan Election "" , went even further with its claim that a third of Karzai 's votes were fraudulent .
If true , that would mean the president received well under the 50 % for him to win on the first round .
Preliminary results give Karzai 55 % and Abdullah 28 % .
The UN - backed Afghan election complaints commission has ordered an audit of 10 % of 3,063 votes deemed to be suspicious either because of a very high turnout or where nearly all votes went to a single candidate .
However , Galbraith writes : "" President Obama needs a legitimate Afghan partner to make any new strategy for the country work .
However , the extensive fraud that took place on August 20 virtually guarantees that a government emerging from the tainted vote will not be credible with many Afghans . ""
Unless the US can build a relationship with a legitimate Afghan partner , its options are drastically reduced .
The White House press secretary , Robert Gibbs , last week recognised as much : "" Without a willing partner , one free of corruption and transparent , I do n't think any situation or any series of meetings can adequately solve for the Afghan people the problem that that would contribute to . ""
In his earlier letter to Ban , Galbraith also claimed Eide prevented him trying to stop the independent election commission , in overall charge of the vote , from abandoning its safeguards , which would have excluded fraudulent ballots , probably reducing Karzai 's score to below 50 % , forcing a second - round vote .
Eide told him to back off , Galbraith said , after Karzai ordered his foreign minister to protest that the American was interfering in Afghan affairs .
He said the Afghan government threatened him with expulsion ."

Galbraith also warned of the huge political dangers if the outcome of the vote is not accepted by the Tajiks , Afghanistan 's second - largest ethnic group , who are predominant in the north and seen as Abdullah 's main constituency . ""
If the Tajiks believe that fraud denied their candidate the chance to compete in a second round , they may respond by simply not recognising the authority of the central government , "" he said .
He also said the high level of fraud "" virtually guarantees that a government emerging from the tainted vote will not be credible with many Afghans "" , destroying President Barack Obama 's hopes of having a legitimate partner in the country to help implement his strategy ."
2009-10-12,"A member of a UN - backed panel set up to investigate complaints of fraud in Afghanistan 's presidential election resigned today , blaming the "" interference of foreigners "" , in a setback to attempts to restore legitimacy to the electoral process .
Maulavi Mustafa Barakzia , one of only two Afghans on the Electoral Complaints Commission , claimed that the three foreigners on the panel – one Canadian , one Dutch and one from the US – were "" making all decisions on their own "" without consultation .
The panel is expected to decide this week how many votes to throw out , a decision that could force a run - off between President Hamid Karzai and his closest challenger , Abdullah Abdullah .
A UN spokesman , Aleem Siddique , said the resignation was "" regrettable but the work of the Election Complaints Commission must continue .
The Afghan people need to see an election outcome that faithfully reflects their will as soon as possible . ""
The UN mission chief , Kai Eide , acknowledged on Saturday that "" widespread fraud "" had occurred in the 20 August presidential election and said the complaints commission was working to determine the extent of it .
Eide 's deputy , Peter Galbraith , the top - ranking American in the UN mission , was sacked last month after alleging that the mission chief played down allegations of widespread ballot - stuffing by Karzai 's supporters .
US relations with Karzai , already frosty before the poll because of widespread allegations of corruption , have been further strained by claims of vote rigging .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said today Karzai had been "" very helpful on many fronts "" , and progress in Afghanistan was often "" overlooked "" .
But she said that if he were returned to office , there would have to be "" a new relationship "" between Karzai and foreign governments .
Clinton , who is visiting Britain , also said the Obama administration was reassessing the relationship between the Taliban and al - Qaida , but denied any change of strategy on Afghanistan had occurred .
Her comments came after reports that the president 's security advisers were pressing him to shift the focus of the war from the Taliban in Afghanistan to al - Qaida in Pakistan .
The Taliban issued a statement last week claiming they posed no international threat , in an apparent attempt to put daylight between themselves and al - Qaida .
Asked whether the US was changing its focus , Clinton told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : "" We are not changing our strategy : our strategy remains to achieve the goal of disrupting , dismantling and defeating al - Qaida and its extremist allies and denying them safe haven and the chance to strike us here in London , in New York and anywhere else . ""
But she added : "" We are doing a much more careful analysis of who is actually allied with al - Qaida .
Not everyone who calls himself a Taliban is necessarily a threat to the UK or the US . ""
Clinton said the US was learning from its experiences in Iraq , where people may have been "" coerced or intimidated "" into fighting alongside al - Qaida .
The US had approached those people and persuaded them to change sides .
"" There may well be a number of people currently who are considered Taliban who are there , frankly , because they get paid to fight or because they see no alternative , "" she said .
Public opinion against the war in Afghanistan has intensified in the US in recent months as the death toll of US troops has mounted .
Obama 's apparent reluctance to provide more soldiers , as requested by General Stanley McChrystal , commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan , has been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of a wavering commitment to the conflict .
Clinton said : "" You should never doubt our commitment or our leadership .
We will not rest until we do defeat al - Qaida , but we want to be smart about how we are proceeding . """
2009-10-14,"Britain will send a further 500 troops to Afghanistan as long as the Afghans also agree to increase their troop deployment in Helmand , Gordon Brown said today .
The prime minister said that he had agreed in principle to increase the size of the British force , from 9,000 to 9,500 , provided the Afghans supplied more troops , the right equipment was available and other countries made a contribution .
In a statement to the Commons , Brown said that he had had assurances from the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , and Abdullah Abdullah , Karzai 's main rival , that the Afghans would deploy more troops to fight alongside the British .
Brown made the announcement straight after prime minister 's questions , which began with the PM reading out a grim rollcall of the 37 troops who have been killed in the conflict while MPs were on their summer recess .
"" It is a very solemn moment .
It is a day in which we put on record in the House of Commons the debt of gratitude to the 37 who have given their lives in Afghanistan , "" Brown said .
"" Nothing can erase the pain for their families .
I know everyone in this House sends their thoughts and prayers to their families .
Their memories live on . ""
In his statement on Afghanistan , Brown said he had agreed "" a new force level "" in Afghanistan subject to certain conditions . ""
First , that a new Afghan government demonstrates its commitment to bring forward the Afghan troops to be trained and to fight alongside our forces . ""
Second , that as before , every soldier and unit deployed to Afghanistan is fully equipped for the operations they are asked to undertake . ""
Third , that our commitment is part of an agreed approach across the international coalition , with all countries bearing their fair share . ""
During PMQs , David Cameron , the Tory leader , quizzed the prime minister over mental health provisions for those returning from the conflict and asked for assurances that troops received proper training before being sent to the front line .
Brown insisted that British soldiers do receive proper training and that veterans are given priority in accessing mental health services .
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , questioned whether it was right for British soldiers to be "" fighting and dying for an Afghan government that is deeply corrupt ? ""
Brown replied : "" No one can be satisfied with what happened during the elections – the amount of ballot - rigging that appears to have taken place .
I hope he will wait until we have the final conclusion from the electoral commission , which will report very soon .
But it is remarkable that elections took place at all . ""
He said British troops remained in Afghanistan to "" protect the streets of Britain "" from the rise of al - Qaida .
Later , Brown updated MPs on the situation in Afghanistan following a difficult summer marked by rising casualties , concerns over the conduct of the Afghan presidential elections , and uncertainty over Barack Obama 's plans .
Despite rising opposition to Britain 's military presence , Brown has bowed to pressure from defence chiefs and agreed to bolster the 9,000-strong British army already deployed in the country .
Public support for the war in Afghanistan has plunged in the face of rising casualties , with a poll for today 's Times showing that a third of voters believe British forces should be withdrawn .
The figure has increased to 36 % from 29 % in mid - September , according to the Populus poll .
During the summer , Brown was wounded by the disclosure from the recently retired head of the army , General Sir Richard Dannatt , that the prime minister had rejected military advice to commit an additional 2,000 troops to the fight against the Taliban .
Dannatt 's claims sparked a full - scale political row after it was disclosed he had agreed to become a military adviser to the Tories , prompting some Labour MPs to question whether he had been pursuing a political agenda all along .
The move to increase the UK 's military presence follows a series of meetings of the cabinet 's Afghanistan and Pakistan committee , attended by defence chiefs and senior ministers .
They have been held in parallel with meetings in the US , where Barack Obama is also under pressure from army chiefs to send in more troops .
The defence secretary , Bob Ainsworth , has described the decision as difficult , saying the extra troops must be "" properly supplied with the kit they need to do the job "" .
Earlier this week , a committee of MPs criticised the Ministry of Defence for not providing British troops with sufficient and reliable armoured vehicles .
Military commanders say more troops are needed to protect and build up the civil infrastructure of areas captured from the Taliban .
Brown , who was said to be in "" close consultation "" with Obama before making his announcement , will privately be hoping the US president follows his example by making his own pledge .
But there is uncertainty over the long - term plans of the Americans .
The US president is considering a proposal by the commander of international forces in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , for up to 40,000 more international troops .
McChrystal wants to pursue a full - scale counter - insurgency strategy – establishing security by building support for the coalition among the ordinary Afghan population .
However , others in the US administration , including the vice - president , Joe Biden , are reported to favour a more limited counterterrorism strategy using unmanned aerial drones and special forces raids to hit al - Qaida targets .
Last night in Washington , Obama was giving little away about when he would reach a decision on McChrystal 's proposals , saying only that he would make an announcement in "" the coming weeks "" ."
2009-10-16,"Britain and the United States are attempting to avert a political crisis in Afghanistan as fears mounted in Kabul that Hamid Karzai will refuse to accept the results of an official inquiry into massive electoral fraud that is expected to trigger a fresh round of voting .
Diplomatic sources in the Afghan capital said the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , was due to call the Afghan president amid concerns that he will reject the findings of the Election Complaints Commission ( ECC ) , due to be published on Saturday .
Downing Street confirmed that Gordon Brown has telephoned the Afghan president twice this week .
The US ambassador to Kabul is expected to visit the presidential palace .
Clinton indicated that a second round of voting would follow the expected report .
"" Whatever the ECC 's recommendation is , I believe it should be followed .
And if that requires a second round that is what should happen , "" she said in an interview with CNN .
She added she expected Karzai to win : "" I think one can conclude that the likelihood of him winning a second round is probably pretty high . ""
The US fears that without a second round of voting leading to a clear result , the legitimacy of Karzai 's presidency would be open to question .
Karzai 's share of the vote is expected to drop to below 50 % as a result of the inquiry , forcing a run - off with his main rival , Abdullah Abdullah .
However , Karzai remains convinced that the level of vote - rigging has been greatly exaggerated .
A western diplomat said that a report in Friday 's Washington Post claiming that Karzai 's share of the vote is set to fall from 55 % to 47 – far lower than expected – had sparked a major political crisis in Kabul . ""
He is in total denial –
he genuinely does not accept the level of fraud .
He believes it 's an American attempt to force him into a second round , "" the diplomat said .
Clinton said the US and Nato are looking at the logistics of holding another election .
"" I think the ballots have been printed and certainly the military , through Nato and through our own troops , is looking at how you would secure such a second round . ""
She said it could be held within the next few weeks before the winter snows close the option until the spring .
The latest possible date is thought to be in mid - November , but the UN maintains that election materials could be sent out around the country next week if necessary .
The uncertainty over the election outcome is complicating the Obama administration 's intense internal debate over US strategy in Afghanistan .
A decision on whether to agree to a request from the US commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , for 40,000 more troops is still several weeks away , a White House spokesman said .
Asked if Obama should delay a decision on sending extra US troops to Afghanistan until after the issue of a new government in Kabul was resolved , Clinton said : "" I think that the president is well aware of all the permutations of what can happen in the election . ""
Although the ECC is due to publish the findings of its investigation of a sample of the 3,498 suspicious ballot boxes , the process of turning their results into a final vote totals will be taken by the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) , a body largely controlled by Karzai and whose staff have been accused of involvement in election fraud .
Steps have also been taken to reduce fraud , including the replacement of 200 district field officers in areas of previous fraud ."
2009-10-18,"The White House expressed its frustration with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , for stalling over an election run - off yesterday , linking the political crisis for the first time to a decision on sending extra US troops to the country .
Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , said the US administration could not make a decision about a request for 40,000 extra troops without a credible government in place in Kabul .
Barack Obama 's Afghan policy is at a critical juncture .
Karzai has a fortnight 's window to hold a run - off in the disputed August election before winter snow makes it logistically impossible .
But he was continuing to hold out yesterday , despite pressure from Washington .
The Obama administration has been delaying a decision on extra troops , because of a divide between members of the cabinet , aides , generals and the intelligence services .
Emanuel is among those advising the US president not to send more troops , partly because of the impact on domestic politics , where the war is increasingly unpopular .
Asked about the troop increase yesterday in a television interview , Emanuel said the central question was "" not how much troops you have , but whether in fact there 's an Afghan partner "" .
He said the White House 's review of its Afghan strategy , including troops levels , would continue next week and the week after .
The US will have 68,000 troops in Afghanistan by the end of the year , but America 's top commander in the country , General Stanley McChrystal , has asked for a further 40,000 .
"" There 's not a security force , an army , the type of services that are important for the Afghans to become true partners , "" Emanuel said .
"" It would be reckless to make a decision on US troop levels if , in fact , you have n't done a thorough analysis of whether there 's an Afghan partner ready to fill that space that the US troops would create , and become a true partner in governing . ""
John Kerry , the Democratic senator and chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , who met Karzai on Saturday to try to persuade him to hold a second round , echoed Emanuel on CBS yesterday .
"" This is a moment for President Karzai to step up and help to share with the world a better vision for how the [ Afghan ] government is going to deliver and be a full partner , "" said Kerry , who , like Emanuel , is sceptical about sending more troops .
Members of Karzai 's entourage say the president is reluctant to hold a run - off .
The US wants Karzai to have the run - off to establish a semblance of legitimacy .
The first round of the presidential election , which Karzai won , was marred by fraud .
If it is demonstrated that he won less than 50 % of the vote , rather than the 55 % he claims , there has to be a run - off against the nearest opponent , in this case the former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah .
The Obama administration has long privately expressed its lack of faith in Karzai because of the high level of corruption in his government .
The organisation responsible for the Afghan election is trying to stop the UN - backed Election Complaints Commission ( ECC ) from throwing out enough of Karzai 's votes to force a second round .
Officials from the Independent Electoral Commission , a body seen as favouring Karzai , blocked a planned announcement yesterday of the results of the fraud investigation by the ECC .
The ECC , which is controlled by a majority of non - Afghans , is facing a growing chorus of anti - foreigner rhetoric in the government - owned media in Afghanistan .
However , in private meetings between the two commissions , IEC officials questioned the findings .
"" The IEC is trying to pick holes in every conceivable calculation and detail to try and hold things up , "" said one official with knowledge of the discussions .
As thousands of Karzai 's supporters took to the streets in Kandahar province to denounce "" foreign meddling "" in the election result , IEC officials admitted they were looking into legal challenges to the ECC 's decision .
On Saturday , Karzai 's spokesman , Waheed Omar , said there had been "" political interference by outsiders "" in the fraud investigation ."
2009-10-19,"A UN - backed panel today said it would announce its long - delayed verdict on Afghanistan 's disputed presidential vote amid US frustration with the president , Hamid Karzai , for stalling over an election run - off .
Pressure has been mounting on Karzai to accept a possible second - round vote against his main rival , Abdullah Abdullah , or work out a deal to break the deadlock ahead of today 's announcement .
"" We will be releasing the results of our findings in a statement today , "" said Nellika Little , a spokeswoman for the Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) .
For the past two months , the ECC has been sifting through thousands of suspicious votes to determine whether Karzai has won outright .
The ECC announcement , originally expected over the weekend , was delayed under pressure from the body responsible for the Afghan election , the Independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) , seen as favouring Karzai .
The IEC is almost certain to challenge the ECC 's findings .
The tainted election has undermined Karzai 's credibility and complicated Barack Obama 's decision on whether to send more US troops to fight a resurgent Taliban .
The White House yesterday linked the Afghan political crisis for the first time to a decision on sending extra US troops to the country .
Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , said the US administration could not make a decision about a request for 40,000 extra troops without a credible government in place in Kabul .

2009-10-19,"A UN - backed election watchdog has declared invalid hundreds of thousands of votes for Afghanistan 's president in the disputed August election , apparently stripping Hamid Karzai of outright victory and setting the stage for a second round .
After nearly two months of investigations , the Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) – controlled by a majority of non - Afghans – found Karzai 's total had fallen to 48.3 % , according to an independent analysis .
He needed 50 % to clinch another term in office .
A separate election commission that backs the president will have to endorse the findings and call for a second - round vote to be held in the next few weeks . ""
Now that we have the ECC orders , we expect the IEC [ Independent Election Commission ] to implement those orders with haste and move swiftly to issue the final certified results or the need for a runoff as required by Afghan electoral law , "" said Aleem Siddique , a UN spokesman in Kabul .
According to the independent analysis by the US - based Democracy International , Karzai 's share of the vote fell from 55 % to 48.3 % after fraudulent votes identified by the EEC were stripped away .
The figures confirmed views expressed anonymously by several foreign diplomats and election workers that Karzai 's share of the vote had dropped to around 48 % .
The president 's closest rival , Abdullah Abdullah , gained from his preliminary tally of 28 % to 31.6 % .
A spokesman for the Karzai campaign , Moen Marastial , said they would accept only the results published by the Independent Election Commission , an Afghan - led organisation thought to be heavily partisan in favour of Karzai .
"" Nothing has been officially announced so far .
Only the ECC has said some votes should be disqualified , "" Marastial said .
He warned that the IEC could disagree the ECC 's findings .
"" I do n't know whether they will accept it or not .
They have the right to work on the procedures and formulas of the investigations and after that they will decide whether they will accept or not , if it is according to international rules of investigation , "" he said .
In its published findings , the ECC stressed that the IEC was constitutionally bound to accept its orders .
Marastial said Karzai may also refuse to accept the results if there was evidence of "" interference in the fraud investigation "" .
Karzai 's supporters have several times suggested that the ECC is controlled by foreign interests .
Any refusal by the IEC to accept the results would spark yet another crisis for a country that has been paralysed by the two - month delay in settling the election result .
Ahead of the announcement , pressure had been mounting on Karzai to accept a possible second - round vote or work out a deal to break the deadlock .
The tainted election has undermined Karzai 's credibility and complicated Barack Obama 's decision on whether to send more US troops to fight a resurgent Taliban .
The White House has linked the Afghan political crisis to a decision on sending extra US troops to the country .
Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , said the US administration could not make a decision about a request for 40,000 extra troops without a credible government in place in Kabul .
The administration has been delaying a decision on extra troops because of a divide between members of the cabinet , aides , generals and the intelligence services .
Emanuel is among those advising the president not to send more troops , partly because of the impact on domestic politics .
The war is increasingly unpopular with Afghans .
The US wants Karzai to accept the runoff to establish a semblance of legitimacy .
The Obama administration has long privately expressed its lack of faith in Karzai because of the widespread corruption in his government .
Karzai has a fortnight 's window to hold a runoff before winter snow makes it impossible ."
2009-10-19,"There is an alternative to the corrupt government of President Hamid Karzai .
It appoints governors , reviews their performance , replaces them if necessary , appoints courts that deliver swift justice , levies taxes and hires a conscript army .
The snag is , it is run by the Taliban .
The hunt for what Rahm Emanuel , Barack Obama 's chief of staff , called an acceptable Afghan partner has proved to be more elusive .
Yesterday the UN - backed Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) delivered its verdict on an election that has been wrong from the start .
It declared hundreds of thousands of votes for Afghanistan 's president invalid , stripping him of outright victory .
Constitutionally , the misleadingly named Independent Election Commission ( a body packed with presidential loyalists ) has no choice but to accept the ECC 's findings .
Just to make the point , the ECC put the word "" order "" , in its missives to the IEC , in capital letters .
The IEC now has to declare that the president 's real vote has fallen below 50 % ( two calculations yesterday put it at 48.3 % ) and order a second round runoff against his main rival Abdullah Abdullah .
But the IEC is almost certain to challenge the ruling .
With a growing chorus of anti - foreign rhetoric filling the government - controlled media , Mr Karzai 's spokesman Waheed Omar talked of "" political interference by outsiders "" .
Hillary Clinton , John Kerry , Gordon Brown and Ban Ki - moon have all tried and failed to get Mr Karzai to accept the ECC 's findings .
They are trying to salvage the wreckage by pushing for a second round and possibly a power - sharing agreement with Dr Abdullah .
But both options are flawed .
There is nothing to guarantee that a second round will not be plagued by the same problems as the first , and the turnout will be lower , because there will be no provincial elections to boost numbers .
And no one has any faith in a government formed by allocating ministries on partisan lines .
The alternative is to appoint an international chief executive to run the country , making Mr Karzai a titular head .
But if Mr Karzai is willing to go to these lengths to rig an election , why would he accept a CEO ?
This election has moved beyond farce , to the point where it is beyond saving .
"" What is the alternative ? ""
the cry goes up .
First , it is worth considering the cost of continuing with current attempts to extract an honest result .
Not only does it stop the White House from announcing any decision on changing its strategy or troop numbers , but also fraudulent governance , in a wider sense , undermines any counter - insurgency effort .
And there is worse .
Well away from the Taliban and Pashtun territory , the governor of the Balkh province , General Atta Mohammad Nur , a former mujahideen commander , is in the process of falling out with the Uzbek warlord and Karzai ally General Abdul Rashid Dostum .
Mr Karzai 's officials warn his many critics in London and Washington against rocking the boat .
The government of Afghanistan is weak enough , they claim .
This misses the point .
As things stand , the president and the system that props him up is the cause of the government 's weakness , not the effect .
Carry on like this and it could all fall apart anyway .
Mr Emanuel is right when he says that no serious crisis should go to waste .
Forming an interim government , or convening a loya jirga to include the widest range of participants , could both be ways re - establishing the legitimacy that the Karzai regime has squandered .
The new government could buy itself some breathing space if it accompanied a ceasefire offer to the Taliban with a future commitment to the withdrawal of all foreign troops .
This is a chance , possibly the last one , for the key Afghan power - brokers to act in the interests of their country , not merely their own interests .
After his performance in the election , let alone his woeful first term , it must be abundantly clear that Hamid Karzai is no longer the man to do this ."
2009-10-19,"What are the prospects of a second round ?
Even before the UN - backed Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) arrived at its ruling , the expectations were that President Hamid Karzai would face a second round against the man who polled second , the former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah .
Afghanistan 's ambassador in the US last week acknowledged that a runoff vote was likely – an implict admission that the August vote was rife with fraud .
Did n't Karzai win in August ?
Karzai won 54.6 % , according to preliminary figures .
But the ECC , led by non - Afghan staff , has been sifting through piles of dubious ballots to determine if Karzai was indeed the outright winner or faces a second round against Abdullah , who came second with 28 % .
According to international officials , the ECC has thrown out hundreds of thousands of votes , apparently setting the stage for a second round .
However , the findings will have to be accepted by the body responsible for the Afghan election , the Independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) .
The IEC , seen as favouring Karzai , is almost certain to challenge the ECC 's findings .
The recount has been almost as controversial as the vote itself , with Karzai complaining about western meddling and Kai Eide , the head of the UN mission in Kabul , accused by his deputy , Peter Galbraith , of covering up the cheating .
How soon could a second round take place ?
Said Tayeb Jawad , the Afghan ambassador in Washington , has said the two - week deadline mandated in the constitution is "" impossible "" , but does not want the date to slip too far into November because the fierce Afghan winter will make conditions too hard for people to travel over long distances , in a country with few roads , to vote .
Too long a delay will also prolong political uncertainty .
The US and its Nato allies agreed last month that any runoff would have to take place by the first week in November .
What are the prospects of a political deal ?
Abdullah last week hinted that he might be willing to accept a powersharing deal with Karzai , but only after an announcement about whether a runoff election is needed .
"" It will be a different environment , no doubt , once the announcement is made , "" Abdullah told a press conference in Kabul .
"" We reserve our reaction , and what to do post - announcement , for that period . ""
Under one scenario doing the rounds in Kabul , Abdullah will withdraw from the second round in return for a position in the government , or possibly the constitutional reform he campaigned on .
Where does this leave the US ?
The election saga has complicated an already difficult situation for the US .
In the last few weeks the White House has been split over whether President Barack Obama should announce troop deployments without knowing who was in charge in Afghanistan or wait until the political situation in Kabul settled .
The Obama administration had been hoping for a clear - cut victory that would provide a legitimate and credible partner to underpin its involvement in Afghanistan .
Now it is stuck with a politically damaged Karzai at a time when Obama has to decide on what strategy to adopt to beat back the Taliban .
General Stanley McChrystal , the US and Nato commander in Afghanistan , has recommended sending 40,000 more US troops in addition to the 68,000 due to be in place by the end of 2009 .
The head of Nato today said time was not on the alliance 's side and that the allies needed to quickly endorse McChrystal 's recommendations .
But an increasingly disenchanted American public is wondering why the US should prop up a discredited regime .
Meanwhile , neighbouring Pakistan has its hands full with its own Taliban problem and is trying to drive the militants from their strongholds in South Waziristan ."
2009-10-19,"Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , will bow to international pressure today and concede that he did not win a clear ­majority in Afghanistan 's bitterly contested election , and also accept there should be a second round of voting .
Senior officials in Kabul said Karzai would resolve the political crisis that has developed over the widespread fraud in the August presidential election , after a frantic round of diplomatic manoeuvring led by John Kerry , the chairman of the Senate foreign affairs committee .
It was feared that Karzai was preparing to reject the UN 's Electoral Complaints Commission 's ( ECC ) orders , which had the effect of cutting his total by 954,526 votes and reducing his percentage of the vote from 55 % to 48.3 % .
Anything less than 50 % should ­automatically trigger a run - off , but Karzai had been disputing the figures .
Diplomats in Kabul had warned of a potential "" car crash "" between Karzai and the ­international community .
Fears of an impasse rose when an Afghan body packed with Karzai 's appointees , the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) , said yesterday that it , not the ECC , had the right to decide whether to hold a run - off .
Kerry , who had been in Kabul over the weekend to press the case with Karzai , flew back to the Afghan capital yesterday for a final round of talks .
At a late meeting last night at the presidential palace , attended by Kerry as well as the British and French ambassadors and the UN special representative , Kai Eide , a deal was struck whereby Karzai will be lauded by other world leaders as a "" statesman "" , even though many observers in Kabul say he has no other choice .
Karzai 's recent threats not to accept the results of the official investigation by the ECC , which found that almost one in every three of his votes was fraudulent , has shocked his western allies who believe he has engaged in dangerous brinkmanship .
A senior diplomatic source said Karzai had been talked round by ultimatums from world leaders , including Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , Gordon Brown and Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary general who made clear that if he did not back down he would "" be working outside the constitution and would no longer be a partner of the west "" .
Only two members of Karzai 's cabinet voted to reject the deal .
But questions remain over how ­Abdullah Abullah , Karzai 's closest rival in the presidential race , will react .
Although Abdullah , a former foreign minister whose vote tally will be increased slightly by the ECC 's findings , has demanded a second round of voting , weather conditions will make such a ­contest impossible unless a decision is taken to hold a vote immediately .
Among the posts that might be offered to Abdullah are head of the constitutional reform committee , acknowledging his campaign calls for power to be decentralised away from the president .
Yesterday Clinton , speaking in Washington , hinted at a resolution to the political crisis in Afghanistan .
She did not want to pre - empt Karzai 's announcement
but she was encouraged by what she had heard .
"" He is going to announce his intentions .
I am going to let him do that , but I am encouraged at the direction that the situation is moving , "" she said .
"" I am very hopeful that we will see a resolution in line with the constitutional order . ""
Washington fears that the Taliban , who are expanding their influence across Afghanistan , could exploit any political vacuum .
Barack Obama led western leaders ­yesterday in stepping up pressure on Karzai to hold a second round to confer legitimacy on the Kabul government .
Robert Gibbs , the White House spokesman , made it clear that Obama wanted the Afghans to hold a run - off .
"" It is now up to the Afghans to make this legitimate , "" he said .
While Gibbs has said before that removing all US troops from Afghanistan was not a viable option , he issued a veiled threat to Karzai , saying that regardless of whether 40,000 extra troops were sent , the almost 68,000 US troops already there needed a credible partner in Kabul .
Brown made his third call to Karzai within a week , telling the Afghan president he should accept a run - off because he was likely to win .
A British government source described the situation in Kabul as "" volatile and unpredictable "" .
Anders Fogh Rasmussen , the Nato secretary general , said in Brussels yesterday that no extra troops would be sent to Afghanistan until the political crisis is resolved , including the 500 extra British troops announced by Brown last week .
"" I hope that we will have a clarification of the political situation in Afghanistan , because time is not on our side , "" he said .
The documents published by the ECC showed many of the ballot boxes inspected by officials had voting papers all marked in a uniform way , or voting forms not folded in half , suggesting that they were never posted through the slot at the top of the ballot box .
Among the evidence uncovered by the ECC were : • More than 30 polling stations where 100 % of the valid votes went to one candidate .
•
A polling station where all the votes showed identical markings , none of the ballots was folded and all 600 votes went to one candidate , but they were recorded as votes for another candidate .
•
In almost a third of the sample ( 92 polling stations ) , 100 % of the papers had uniform markings .
Another 69 polling stations recorded 75 % of the ballots showing uniform markings .
•
In 41 polling stations all of the ballot papers were not folded .
It was on the basis of those discoveries that the ECC ordered the IEC to invalidate percentages of each candidates ' vote , a complex method that has never before been used in an election where it might have a decisive impact .
But one UN official said the amount of votes disqualified was only a "" subset "" of actual level of fraud which would have been discovered had the ECC widened its investigation .
"" We will never know the full extent of the fraud , "" the official said ."
2009-10-20,"Afghanistan will hold a second round of voting on 7 November after an election panel reluctantly accepted that massive fraud took place in August 's poll , which President Hamid Karzai was declared to have won .
The Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) , which is packed with Karzai supporters , initially resisted the findings of fraud but – like Karzai – succumbed to concerted western pressure for a runoff after it became clear ballot - rigging had taken place on an epic scale .
At a press conference to announce the runoff , Karzai said the IEC 's decision to hold a second round in November was legal and constitutional .
"" We believe that this decision of the IEC is legitimate , legal and constitutional , and that it strengthens the path towards democracy , "" Karzai said in remarks broadcast live on Afghan television .
US senator John Kerry , who was in Kabul for some diplomatic arm - twisting , sought to put the best spin on what has been a chaotic election process .
Praising Karzai for his "" great leadership "" , Kerry told reporters : "" A great moment of uncertainty has been transformed into a time of great opportunity . ""
Barack Obama welcomed Karzai 's acceptance of a runoff election , saying it was an important step forward for democracy .
The US president said in a statement : "" It is now vital that all elements of Afghan society continue to come together to advance democracy , peace and justice .
We look forward to a second round of voting , and the completion of the process to choose the president of Afghanistan . ""
Gordon Brown said Karzai 's promise to hold a second ballot was "" statesmanlike "" .
The prime minister said it was clear there had been flaws in the election process and that it was now vital that the country 's new government "" had legitimacy in the eyes of its people "" .
The chairman of the IEC , Azizullah Lodin , said the commission had wanted to "" leave the people of Afghanistan in uncertainty "" no longer . ""
The commission agreed to go to a second round and say that nobody got more than 50 % , "" Lodin said , adding that all the materials were ready for the runoff .
Karzai is still likely to emerge the winner – as a Pashtun , he is a member of Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group .
But his credibility has been severely undermined by the scale of fraud in the first round .
It was feared that Karzai was preparing to reject the UN Electoral Complaints Commission 's ( ECC ) findings of fraud , which had the effect of cutting his total by 954,526 votes and reducing his share of the vote from 55 % to 48.3 % .
Anything less than 50 % should automatically trigger a runoff , but Karzai had been disputing the figures .
Peter Galbraith , the deputy head of the UN mission in Afghanistan , who was sacked for being too vocal on election fraud , warned today that a second round held on the same basis as August 's would be a disaster .
Galbraith , speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , called for the IEC to be scrapped .
France 's foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , predicted on France - Info radio that Karzai would accept a runoff because he "" is rather smart .
And in any case , he has won . ""
Kouchner said that even after the ECC had thrown out a third of Karzai 's votes from the first round , Karzai still won about twice as many votes as former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah , who came second .
In a late meetinglast night at the presidential palace , attended by Kerry as well as the British and French ambassadors and the UN special representative , Kai Eide , a deal was struck whereby Karzai would be lauded by other world leaders as a "" statesman "" .
Karzai 's recent threats not to accept the results of the official investigation by the ECC , which found that almost one in every three of his votes was fraudulent , shocked his western allies , who believe he has engaged in dangerous brinkmanship .

Only two members of Karzai 's cabinet voted to reject the deal .
But questions remain over how Abdullah will react .
Among the posts that may be offered to Abdullah are head of the constitutional reform committee , acknowledging his campaign calls for power to be decentralised away from the president ."
2009-10-20,"President Hamid Karzai 's decision to call a run - off election next month was hailed today by Senator John Kerry , who had been hastily dispatched to Kabul by Barack Obama to make it clear to Karzai that resolution of the political crisis was a prerequisite for increased military support .
Kerry said that lack of a clear outcome in the election had left "" many Afghans with legitimate doubts about the future "" .
He said : "" With the nation facing extraordinary challenges , a time of real uncertainty has been transformed into a time of great opportunity . ""
Kerry met the Afghan president at least twice to press the issue in the wake of the Nato commander General Stanley McChrystal 's assessment that underpinning any future military strategy against the Taliban has to be popular support for a credible government in Kabul , a view shared by the White House .
Kerry reinforced McChrystal 's point .
"" The future of Afghanistan will ultimately be determined by Afghan civilians and through good governance – not soldiers or the international community .
If this is to be a real turning point , we must strengthen the capacity of the government at every level to provide for its citizens , "" he said .
Obama is still considering a request from McChrystal for up to 40,000 additional troops for Afghanistan .
Today he described the decision to call a second round of balloting as "" in the best interests of the Afghan people "" .
He said : "" While this election could have remained unresolved to the detriment of the country , President Karzai 's constructive actions established an important precedent for Afghanistan 's new democracy . ""
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , said the continuing political upheaval should not obstruct the administration 's efforts to introduce a new military strategy .
"" We are not going to just sit on our hands waiting for the outcome of this election and for the emergence of a government in Kabul , "" he said .
"" We have operations under way and we will continue to conduct those operations . ""
But there was a warning from Peter Galbraith , the American deputy head of the UN mission in Kabul , who was fired after he openly criticised the ballot rigging .
In an interview with Radio 4 's Today programme he called for the Afghan electoral commission to be scrapped because it lacks credibility , as a pro - Karzai body , after overseeing the earlier fraud .
"" If it 's held on the same basis as the 20 August then it 'll be a disaster , because all the problems that created the fraud then are still present , "" he said .
He also mentioned the problem of holding an election in difficult November weather ."
2009-10-20,"Will the November result be any different ?
President Hamid Karzai should win again .
As the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner pointed out , even though a UN - backed panel declared a third of Karzai 's votes from the first round to be invalid , Karzai still won about twice as many votes as Abdullah Abdullah , the former foreign minister and nearest contender .
Karzai has a built - in advantage as he is a Pashtun , Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group .
The irony of the whole election saga is that Karzai would have won without any ballot - rigging .
As it is , the blatant fraud has badly undermined Karzai 's credibility and frayed his relations with the US and his other western backers .
The White House , which is trying to decide whether to send more troops to fight the Taliban , now stands accused of backing a corrupt and incompetent leader .
Is Afghanistan ready for another vote ?
The chairman of the Independent Election Commission , Azizullah Lodin , has said that all the materials are ready for the November runoff .
The UN will have to get ballot boxes out to the provincial centres and then move them out to polling stations on the eve of voting day .
Winter is approaching and there are fears that conditions will prove difficult for people to travel over long distances to vote .
But US army engineers say logistically an election is possible up until mid - November .
The troops Nato deployed to provide security for the election in August are still in place and the Afghan government is ready to send out the police and its armed forces .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , said holding a second round would be a huge challenge but that the UN would do everything to ensure that the runoff will be transparent and credible .
Will there be a recurrence of fraud ?
Despite its name , the IEC – the organisation responsible for running the election – is anything but independent as it is stuffed with Karzai 's people .
Ideally , from Abdullah 's perspective , the IEC would be overhauled from top to bottom to ensure a fair vote next month .
That is what Peter Galbraith , the deputy head of mission in Afghanistan who was sacked for sounding off on fraud , is advocating .
But with only a few weeks to go , wholesale change is impractical .
He also called for "" ghost polling "" stations , where Karzai power - brokers could stuff ballot boxes with impunity , to be closed down .
The assumption is that the IEC will refrain from another round of blatant vote - rigging after it backfired politically .
In the recount by the UN - backed Electoral Complaints Commission , Karzai 's vote fell to 48.3 % from the initial 54.6 % , while Abdullah saw his share rise to 31.5 % from 27.7 % .
What of the talk of a deal between Karzai and Abdullah ?
The US appears to be backing a power - sharing deal between the two men .
The Abdullah camp insists that a coalition is against the law , but reports persist of the two being open to such an idea .
There was also talk of Abdullah withdrawing from the second round in return for a position in the government , or possibly the constitutional reform he campaigned for , but that seems less likely now Karzai has agreed to a runoff ."
2009-10-20,"World leaders rushed to praise Hamid Karzai today after the Afghan president succumbed to intense international pressure and agreed to a second round runoff in Afghanistan 's election .
Gordon Brown praised Karzai as "" statesmanlike "" after the Afghan president accepted the result of a UN - backed fraud investigation which stripped him of almost 1 million votes cast in August , taking away the absolute majority he required to win on a first round .
Speaking at the presidential palace today about the fresh vote scheduled for 7 November , Karzai made no mention of cheating committed for his benefit , saying the "" election of the people of Afghanistan has been defamed "" .
He also said he was agreeing to a runoff because "" I prefer the national interests of Afghanistan over my personal interest . ""
For days Karzai had flirted with a potentially catastrophic plan to reject the findings of the UN - backed Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) , leading to a president lacking a popular mandate and the possibility of civil unrest .
But today he committed himself to an election in less than three weeks after accepting a ruling earlier in the day by the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) , the Afghan organisation regarded as biased towards Karzai .
He was flanked by Kai Eide , the most senior UN official in the country , and John Kerry , the US senator who has been instrumental in heading the campaign by leading western countries to talk Karzai round .
Kerry made no references to the fraud in August 's election which , according to the ECC , resulted in almost one third of Karzai 's votes being suspicious , and said : "" Today he [ Karzai ] showed statesmanship by deciding to move forward the country and by embracing the constitution and the rule of law . ""
Diplomatic sources said Karzai had to be forced into accepting the findings by world leaders threatening to withdraw their support for him if he attempted to ignore the Afghan constitution and challenge the ECC 's orders .
In recent days White House officials have made clear that the US would not commit to sending thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan until a "" credible partner "" emerged from the election .
Barack Obama welcomed Karzai 's statement .
"" This is an important step forward in ensuring a credible process for the Afghan people which results in a government that reflects their will , "" he said .
Brown acknowledged there had been flaws in the vote , but pointedly praised Karzai 's "" statesmanlike statement "" , saying "" the international community too will join me in welcoming the leadership he has shown today "" .
Brown 's officials were determined to focus on the expected runoff and insisted they would not become involved in finger pointing over election fraud .
They said they expected a lower turnout in the runoff , and said contingency plans had been prepared to try to reduce ballot stuffing and intimidation .
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , called Karzai "" a statesman who can decide on what is essential , in the higher interests of his country and of the unity of the Afghan people "" .
Shortly before Karzai 's press conference , the IEC announced its findings , saying he had received 49.7 % of the vote – higher than the analysis accepted by most of Kabul 's diplomatic community that the president got around 48 % , but still below the 50 % required to win the first round .
Despite Karzai 's insistence that the runoff would go ahead , there are doubts that it will happen .
Winter is closing in and it is unlikely the IEC can be reformed in time , following allegations that many of its officials were complicit in fraud .
The UN maintains that everything is ready , with all the necessary ballot papers , indelible inks and other materials available .
But it is feared that the second round could be worse than the first , with high levels of fraud , violence and a lower turnout .
Many diplomats believe the exercise could be avoided if an agreement could be reached between Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah , his main rival in the first round . ""
They both know that the only people who will benefit from a second round are the Taliban and they now have time to come to some sort of agreement , "" said one western official .
But both Karzai and Kerry denied the rumours of a deal between the two main contenders , including local media reports that 12 cabinet posts had been reserved for Abdullah 's supporters .
"" There is no place for coalition government in the law , "" Karzai said , adding that "" we need a national unity government and not a coalition government "" .
He called on a group Pashtun elders , Afghanistan 's biggest ethnic group of which he is himself a member , to help him deliver an outright win that would allow him to avoid any political compromises .
Ahmed Wali Massoud , a senior opposition leader , also said a deal was legally problematic because there is "" no lawful framework for Abdullah to withdraw .
Based on the law , it has to go to a second round .
Any sort of a coalition has to be based on a programme , not on who gets what jobs or ministries , "" he said .
"" That does n't work in Afghanistan any more .
Mr Karzai has n't had a programme for the last five years , which is why his government failed , because it relied on personalities . """
2009-10-21,"Can fraud be prevented this time round ?
Most observers agree the single biggest weakness in Afghanistan 's deeply flawed election was the Independent Election Commission , a body dominated by men appointed by Hamid Karzai , which has been implicated in fraud at all levels of the process .
Ban ki - Moon , the UN secretary general , hopes that everyone involved in fraud will be sacked before the second round .
But the only organisation which has the power to overhaul the IEC is the IEC itself , and early indications yesterday did not suggest the organisation was going to get its house in order .
The IEC chairman , Aziullah Ludin , was defensive , admitting only that "" there was some fraud "" .
He also said reports that 200 district polling managers will be sacked were incorrect – their cases are being examined , an investigation which may not conclude before the voting ends .
And even if those people can be replaced , it is unclear that new electoral officials will be any less inclined towards fraud .
Polling station workers are recruited locally and can therefore be heavily influenced by powerful local figures , such as tribal elders and warlords .
With such structural problems unresolved some experts believe it is pointless to hold an election before the IEC can be totally reformed .
But such a root and branch reform would only be possible with Karzai 's blessing .
"" If there are no proper changes in the IEC then people will still feel that this is an election that will be shaped by IEC and it 's not their votes that will determine the outcome , it 's the IEC , "" said Martine van Bijlert , co - director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network .
Will Afghans turn out to vote ?
Excluding fraudulent votes 4.3 m people participated in the first round , and most independent observers fear that turnout will be even lower in the runoff .
Haroun Mir , head of the Centre for Research and Policy Studies in Kabul , said : "" This time round the provincial elections will not be taking place at the same time so fewer people will vote .
If you walk round Kabul you see that all the campaign offices were shut down weeks ago .
How are the campaigns going to mobilise people in just two weeks ? ""
The Taliban have also vowed to disrupt the second round , as they did in August with attacks on polling stations and a campaign of intimidation against voters .
Fears of Taliban retribution , as well as widespread cynicism about a process which many Afghans see as being dictated by foreigners , could keep voters away .
Can security be assured ?
A massive security operation was launched for the first round of voting in August and polling day still turned into the single most violent day in years , with hundreds of Taliban attacks and other security incidents .
A meeting of senior western and Afghan officials due to start tonight at the Ministry of Defence was expected to discuss a new security plan – but Nato said they expected their plans to be similar to before , with foreign troops mostly supporting the Afghan police and army from a distance .
Some of the 10,000 extra Nato troops drafted in for the first round have already returned to their home countries , whilst Afghan national army soldiers will also have to re - deployed .
Will the weather hold off to allow people to go to the polls ?
Debate over Afghanistan 's weather patterns has been one of the more bizarre elements of the long drawn - out election .
The risk of heavy snowfall cutting off large parts of the country and preventing people from voting had been used by pro - Karzai officials as an excuse not to have a runoff any later than October 15 .
But an analysis of historical weather patterns by the US Army Corps of Engineers says that November 15 should be the latest possible date .

Speaking at his house in the capital , Kabul , he said : "" Some people lost their finger in the last round elections [ so ] this is a serious issue , and in order to prepare the ground for transparency and fairness of the elections we have certain recommendations , suggestions as well as conditions that … we will come up with soon . ""
Abdullah 's comments came as the UN said that 200 out of 380 district election officials from the government - appointed Independent Election Commission had been fired following evidence of vote - rigging .
"" More than half of the district field coordinators are being replaced to prevent any attempted fraud or because there have been complaints made against them by candidates and observers , "" said Aleem Siddique , a spokesman for the UN mission in Afghanistan , according to Reuters .
Karzai agreed yesterday to a runoff vote following intense international pressure in the wake of a UN - backed investigation stripped him of almost 1 million votes he won in August .
Abdullah said that while all preparations were being made to ensure the runoff – scheduled for 7 November – goes ahead , the logistics may yet prove impossible .
"" I do hope [ there will be an election ] because if suddenly we have a bad winter
, that 's a possibility , that 's a likelihood , but I am not speculating on a scenario that elections do n't take place on time , "" he said .
The cutting off of large parts of the mountainous north of the country by heavy snow is just one potential problem confronting a second round of voting .
Other issues include whether or not polling stations will open in areas so insecure that it is impossible to monitor fraud .
Most such areas are in Karzai 's political heartlands in the Pashtun south .
Last time the Karzai government successfully lobbied against attempts by some UN officials not to open so - called "" ghost polling "" stations in order to prevent fraud .
Abdullah said no voters should be disenfranchised because of insecurity , but warned that there were "" certain sad realities "" that could make it impossible to stop the Taliban from intimidating voters .
"" How to overcome this it is for our security institutions and the international forces , "" he said .
Because of the difficulties of both ensuring security and preventing fraud , many western diplomats hope that a runoff can be avoided altogether if Karzai and Abdullah can strike some sort of deal .
However , Karzai has publicly said he is not interested in coalition government , and today Abdullah said he was "" not under any pressure from any sides "" to come to an arrangement with the president .
Karzai won praise yesterday from Barack Obama and Gordon Brown , among others , after he announced the runoff vote , saying : "" I prefer the national interests of Afghanistan over my personal interest . ""
For days Karzai had flirted with a potentially catastrophic plan to reject the findings of the UN - backed Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) , leading to a president lacking a popular mandate and the possibility of civil unrest .
Diplomatic sources said Karzai had to be forced into accepting the findings by world leaders threatening to withdraw their support for him if he tried to ignore the Afghan constitution and challenge the ECC 's orders .
In recent days , White House officials have made clear that the US would not commit to sending thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan until a "" credible partner "" emerged from the election ."
2009-10-28,"Ahmed Wali Karzai , the younger brother of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has been on the CIA 's payroll for almost eight years , it was reported today .
The New York Times , quoting unnamed current and former US officials , reported that the CIA was paying the president 's brother , long alleged to be a powerful druglord , for "" a variety of services "" .
The report said these included the recruitment of a paramilitary group to do US bidding in and around Kandahar , where he is the head of the provincial council .
The paramilitaries – known as the Kandahar Strike Force – have been accused of conducting rogue operations and score - settling .
They are based in a Kandahar compound that Ahmed Wali Karzai also rents to the CIA and US special forces as an operations base , the report said .
The president 's brother was also reported to act as a middle man between the CIA and Taliban loyalists as part of attempts to persuade them to change sides .
He has long been alleged to be involved in the opium trade in southern Afghanistan , and the CIA links are a cause of deep divisions in Barack Obama 's administration , the New York Times said .
Ahmed Wali Karzai denied being involved in drug trafficking , or being paid by the CIA , in an interview with the newspaper .
"" I work with the Americans , the Canadians , the British , anyone who asks for my help .
They [ CIA ] do their own recruitment .
I have no idea where they get their recruits .
It 's absolutely ridiculous , "" he told the Associated Press .
Associated Press quoted a US congressional official as confirming the New York Times story , and saying some in Congress had known of the link "" for some time "" .
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations on Monday , the US senator John Kerry said he had asked US intelligence and law enforcement for solid evidence against Ahmed Wali Karzai but had not been given any .
"" I have requested from our intelligence sources and law enforcement folks the smoking gun , the evidence , "" he said .
"" Nobody has given me the sort of hard and fast ' here 's what we heard them say ' or ' here 's what we 've caught him doing ' or ' here 's what he 's involved in ' .
So this swirls around . ""
Kerry said there were "" things that Ahmed Wali Karzai has done that have n't been helpful .
There are things he does that are very helpful for us . ""
He added : "" We need to look hard at the balance of how we can best manage Kandahar and that particular region . ""
The report of CIA ties comes at a time when the Obama administration is contemplating increasing US troop numbers in Afghanistan , and 10 days before the second round of the country 's presidential elections , called after evidence emerged of widespread voter fraud in the first round by Hamid Karzai 's brothers .
The president is widely expected to win the second round against a former foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , and it had been hoped that the poll would help bolster Karzai 's flagging legitimacy among Afghans .
But reports of ties between his brother and the CIA are likely to damage his credibility still further .
The report will also revive debate in the US over the CIA 's role .
The agency was heavily criticised for its links with rightwing paramilitaries and drug lords in Latin America in the 1970s and 80s .
But after the 11 September 2001 attacks , critics argued it had become too timid and was so constrained by rules and political correctness that it was virtually unable to gather intelligence in troubled parts of the world ."
2009-10-28,"Today 's NYT scoop quotes current and former officials as saying that Ahmed Wali Karzai , the Afghan president 's brother , has been on a CIA retainer for much of the past eight years .
That may explain something Senator John Kerry said at the Council on Foreign Relations on Monday , about his recent visit to Afghanistan and a chat he had there with President Hamid Karzai .
During our walk , we had a very direct conversation ...
In fact , he asked me about it , he raised the subject , quite interesting .
And we talked about the perceptions of his brother .
Let me just say this in answer to this .
I have requested from our intelligence sources and law enforcement folks the smoking gun , the evidence .
Show me , what do we know ?
And I 'll tell you right now , folks , nobody has , nobody has .
Nobody has given me
the sort of hard - and - fast here 's what we heard him say , or here 's what we caught him doing , or here 's what he 's involved in , etc , so this swirls around .
And you know , there are lots of different stories like that that swirl around .
Now , I 'm not going to go into all of the conversation I had with the president .
I think there are things that Ahmed Wali Karzai has done that have n't been helpful .
There are things he does that are very helpful for us .
And we need to look hard at the balance of how we can best manage Kandahar and that particular region .
This is no doubt going to bring back to life the debate on how clean the CIA 's hands should be in a dirty war .
There was a general sense after 9/11 that it had become so cautious and squeaky clean that in the words of one CIA case officer , "" Operations that include diarrhoea as a way of life do n't happen .
"" There are now no doubt many , many CIA agents getting diarrhoea on a regular basis in far flung parts of the world , and doing business with lots of local warlords , all of whom could one day prove an embarrassment .
The link to the Kandahar Strike Force , in particular , looks like a hostage to fortune ."
2009-10-29,"The chances of another disastrous round of voting in Afghanistan 's presidential race increased dramatically today after the country 's election authority defied international pressure to cut the number of polling centres in order to reduce fraud .
To the fury of UN officials in Kabul , the so - called Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) announced that it planned to open 155 more polling stations – up from 6,167 to 6,322 – than during the first vote on 20 August , despite repeated claims by the UN that there would be a reduction .
Ever since an official inquiry uncovered almost 1 m fraudulent votes cast in favour of the president , Hamid Karzai , the country 's western backers have insisted that fewer centres should be opened in the run - off next Saturday .
But the IEC said assurances by Afghanistan 's security chiefs that conditions had improved in some areas of the country allowed for the opening of more centres .
In the first round , polling stations operated in areas that were so insecure that election monitors were unable to deter wholesale ballot stuffing .
Karzai 's main opponent , Abdullah Abdullah , had said he would only participate if 500 polling centres were closed and the head of the IEC was sacked .
UN staff said the IEC decision meant voting would take place in areas where fraud was known to have been committed , or in areas where almost no one had previously turned out to vote .
A western diplomat involved in organising the vote said the news was a "" punch in the stomach , because everything we asked them to do they rejected "" .
He said it had shattered morale among election workers , already at a low ebb after six UN members of staff involved in election preparations were killed by a Taliban hit squad in an attack on a guesthouse in Kabul yesterday . ""
This – on top of yesterday 's incident – there really is only so much you can take , "" he said .
It was reported last night that the UN had ordered all non - essential staff to leave the country .
Officials told the Times that about 1,000 UN workers not involved in the voting were told to return to their home countries during the election period because of the security situation .
Despite claims by Richard Holbrooke , the US special envoy to the region , that fraud would be reduced in the second round , election observers in Kabul believe a clean vote is impossible .
"" It 's going to be a fraudulent election , we ca n't kid ourselves on that , "" one diplomat said .
"" The only thing that could stop it now would be if the international community as a whole decided to distance themselves from this election , and that 's not going to happen . ""
One election observer said the US and the UK had already turned a blind eye to many of the IEC 's failings in the first round of voting "" for the sake of looking forward "" .
For example , no pressure had been put on the IEC to even publish its full results for the 20 August poll .
"" They will present those views to the president , collectively and individually , "" a Pentagon official said .
"" The chiefs ' views in regard to [ troop ] resources will be an important factor . ""
According to an analysis by the Organisation for Security and Co - operation in Europe , the IEC 's final published tables has missing or incomplete results for more than 4,000 polling stations .
Nor has the IEC explained why it did not follow orders from the UN - appointed watchdog , the Electoral Complaints Commission , to annul results from 210 polling stations .
The IEC only cancelled votes cast in 147 stations , which probably ensured that Karzai 's final official result for the first round was only slightly lower than the 50 % overall majority he desperately wanted , rather than the result privately calculated by the ECC of 48.3 % .
Meanwhile , US military chiefs plan to present recommendations on troop strength and strategy in Afghanistan to President Barack Obama today , officials said , a sign that the White House 's deliberations may be nearing a conclusion .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , and the chairman and vice - chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , Admiral Mike Mullen and General James Cartwright , will be joined at the White House meeting by the top leaders of the army , marine corps , navy and air force ."
2009-10-31,"Abdullah Abdullah , the main challenger in the Afghan presidential election , is close to quitting next Saturday 's presidential runoff poll against incumbent Hamid Karzai - a move likely to further undermine the credibility of the country 's government .
Abdullah had laid down conditions for his participation in the second round of the elections but the deadline for Karzai 's government to meet them passed today without an agreement being reached .
The former Afghan foreign minister demanded the resignation of key election officials , cabinet ministers and provincial governors as a way to avoid a repeat of the massive fraud in the presidential vote in August .
He will officially announce whether he will boycott the election tomorrow , following a loya jirga , or grand assembly of elders , his campaign team announced today .
Negotiations between the rival camps , which included a power - sharing proposal by Abdullah , broke down yesterday , according to western and Afghan sources .
A spokesman for the Abdullah campaign , Fazel Sancharaki , said the candidate would wait until the end of Saturday to see if his demands were met .
But a source told the Associated Press that Abdullah was likely to tell his supporters to stay home during the vote .
Western officials have noted that Abdullah has not opened any campaign offices since the runoff was called last week .
Neither candidate has campaigned openly .
"" The signs are there .
[ Abdullah 's ] not doing any campaigning .
Everyone is looking at the two camps and willing them to do some form of accommodation that will avoid a runoff , "" a western diplomatic source told Reuters .
According to the Afghan constitution , any vote cast for a candidate who withdraws will not be counted .
But it does not specifically address a candidate who does not formally withdraw but urges supporters to boycott the polls .
A spokesman for the Afghan election commission said it was too late for Abdullah to officially withdraw and that a boycott would not prevent the runoff from going forward . ""
The election will be held and all procedures will go as normal , "" Noor Mohammad Noor said .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said a runoff vote with only one candidate would not necessarily threaten the legitimacy of the process .
"" We see that happen in our own country where , for whatever combination of reasons , one of the candidates decides not to go forward , "" said Clinton .
"" I do n't think it has anything to do with the legitimacy of the election .
It 's a personal choice which may or may not be made . ""
The runoff election in Afghanistan became necessary after an official inquiry uncovered almost 1 m fraudulent votes cast in favour of Karzai , pushing him below the required 50 % margin to win .
Abdullah has complained there were no assurances that the new vote would be fairer than the first ballot ."
2009-11-01,"Afghanistan 's western backers are pushing for a rapid coronation of Hamid Karzai as president without going through with a second round of voting after the Afghan president 's closest rival pulled out of the race today .
Abdullah Abdullah withdrew from the runoff vote after the rejection of nearly all of his demands for changes to the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) and the suspension of government ministers , which he said would have reduced the risk of massive fraud in the next round of voting .
The announcement threw the election into disarray , with some analysts labelling the fiasco "" a shocking failure "" of efforts by the west and other international communities to build a democracy in Afghanistan .
A legitimate Afghan leader is seen as essential to western war aims , and has prevented Barack Obama from being able to make a decision on whether to send up to 40,000 more US troops to Afghanistan .
To cheers and applause , an emotional Dr Abdullah told thousands of his supporters gathered in an enormous tent in Kabul that he had no choice but to bow out "" because of the action taken by this government and the action taken by the Independent Election Commission "" .
But despite Abdullah 's announcement both Karzai 's campaign and the IEC said the runoff vote should go ahead because there was no other legal method for choosing the president .
The former foreign minister 's supporters know that Karzai now faces two unenviable choices .
He could either go ahead and win a mandate based on a second round which is likely to attract even fewer participants than the first vote in August .
Or he could be simply be appointed as leader without the 50 % of votes the constitution says the president requires to be elected .
"" Whatever he does he will not be legitimate , "" said Ahmed Wali Massoud , a leading political figure and a senior member of Abdullah 's campaign team .
Nick Horne , a former UN political officer who resigned over the organisation 's handling of the elections , said a second round without Abdullah would give Karzai an "" exceptionally weak mandate "" with which to counter the Taliban insurgency .
Haroun Mir , head of the Centre for Research and Policy Studies in Kabul , said that the Afghan state could even risk losing control over the northern areas where Abdullah 's supporters could refuse to recognise the authority of Karzai .
But Waheed Omar , Karzai 's campaign spokesman , said the "" election has to go ahead and the people of Afghanistan have to be given the right to vote "" .
His view was echoed by the IEC chairman , Azizullah Ludin , who said "" there was no alternative under the law "" to a second round .
But a UN spokesman said : "" It 's difficult to see how you can have a runoff with only one candidate . ""
Senior diplomats privately say they do not want to risk their troops ' lives in order to protect another election .
They say there is enough ambiguity in Afghanistan 's constitution that would allow the country 's Supreme Court to rule that a second round is not necessary and that Karzai should be elected on the basis that he received the highest number of votes in the first .
Many Afghan and western lawyers strongly disagree , however , saying that the Supreme Court does not have the power to interpret the constitution to the degree necessary .
On Saturday the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said a decision by Abdullah to pull out would not affect the vote 's legitimacy .
But another senior Abdullah campaign member , Nadjib Yussufi , said that if Karzai had any "" political wisdom "" he would back the establishment of an interim government and reform of the IEC which would allow Abdullah to participate in elections in the spring .
Both Massoud and Abdullah hinted yesterday that he would consider re - entering the race if conditions for a runoff vote were made fairer .
But western diplomats believe that would simply prolong Afghanistan 's political limbo .
During the 108 days since the campaign period officially began in July the government has been unable to take major decisions .
A spring election would prevent the government from taking steps which foreign diplomats hope will start to deal with the country 's many problems , including corruption and declining security .
With so many unpalatable options confronting them , diplomats pushed until late on Saturday evening for a power - sharing deal between Karzai and Abdullah .
The negotiations , led by UN chief Kai Eide and US ambassador Karl Eikenberry , appeared to have made a breakthrough with western diplomats saying Abdullah would concede defeat in return for being given a say in the appointment of key cabinet ministers .
Although the talks finally broke down , Abdullah did not call for a boycott of the election as some had feared , instead saying he would merely "" not participate "" in the process .
He also said he had told his supporters to remain calm and not to protest , or even to come together in large gatherings ."
2009-11-01,"In Afghanistan 's disreputable 2009 presidential election , everyone 's a loser .
Hamid Karzai 's "" victory "" , achieved by fraud and now by default , has left him a tarnished , diminished figure .
The US administration that orchestrated the whole process still lacks the credible partner in Kabul
it says is essential for success .
The UN 's reputation for probity lies critically wounded in the gutter , a victim of inaction and bitter infighting among officials .
Nato 's mission looks even more rudderless and ill - defined than before .
The cause of the Afghan people , bemused and terrorised by turns , is no further forward and may in truth have been set back .
US officials risked ridicule by claiming the election process remained credible , despite the decision of Abdullah Abdullah , Karzai 's only remaining rival , to pull out of a second round run - off .
Referring to wildly dissimilar American election precedents , secretary of state Hillary Clinton said his withdrawal did not necessarily destroy the validity of the run - off – even if only one candidate was running .
"" It 's not surprising that he [ Abdullah ] is not going to contest an election he was n't going to win , "" an unnamed White House official told the Washington Post .
"" This is not a challenge in any way to the process of choosing the next Afghan president .
This is politics . ""
The official went on : "" However this shakes out , it does not affect the legitimacy of the process . ""
This creative interpretation of the weekend 's events ignored the fact that it was Hillary Clinton and Richard Holbrooke , the US special Afghanistan - Pakistan representative , who only a few days ago strong - armed Karzai into accepting a second round .
It was essential , they said , given that his supposed first - round victory was fraudulent to the point of farce .
The White House spinners also dodged the obvious conclusion , arising from Abdullah 's withdrawal , that notwithstanding all their power and influence , the US , the UN , and assembled western diplomats , plus Afghanistan 's discredited Independent Election Commission were unable , in the final analysis , to ensure a free and fair vote .
Abdullah 's call for the replacement of compromised election officials was ignored .
The UN 's wish that the number of polling stations be reduced to lessen the chance of a repeat fraud received similar short shrift .
It had become clear in recent days that there was little or nothing to prevent further pro - Karzai ballot - rigging on an epic scale .
Whether the run - off will go ahead remains uncertain at this point .
If Abdullah cuts some kind of power - sharing or national unity deal with Karzai , it may be cancelled and further embarrassment avoided .
Or it may go ahead – but more "" smoothly "" , given that there will be no actual contest .
Some western officials seem to be privately hoping for this sort of fudge .
Peter Galbraith , a former senior American diplomat who was sacked from the UN mission in Kabul in a row over its turning a blind eye to ballot rigging , warned last week that a fraud - stained second round would be "" catastrophic for Afghanistan and the allied military mission battling the Taliban and al - Qaida "" .
For this reason , others might say , rendering a second round irrelevant has obvious attractions .
Galbraith said a Karzai second term , however achieved , would be "" tainted at home and abroad "" .
To overcome this crisis of legitimacy , he urged the adoption of reforms put forward by Abdullah that would allow greater power - sharing among ethnic groups , the election of provincial governors , increased power for local governments , and the appointment of a prime minister and cabinet by parliament , not by the president .
Barack Obama may insist on such reforms as part of his still unfinished Afghan policy review .
Reducing Karzai 's powers in these ways would provide a fig leaf for Washington 's abject failure to secure the democratic and governmental advances that it hoped would justify ever more costly , and ever more unpopular , US and Nato military involvement .
As of last Friday , Obama , like an ivory tower professor struggling to engage with reality , was still calling for more option papers from the Pentagon on future troop levels .
The latest word in Washington is that he will increase US forces , though by fewer than the 40,000 additional troops requested by his commander , General Stanley McChrystal .
They will be used to defend key Afghan cities and population centres from Taliban attack .
In the countryside , US and Nato forces may shift to guerrilla - style , counter - terrorist tactics .
Maybe , given time , Obama can turn things around .
But his inability to prevent the US - promoted election turning into a five - star debacle was damaging .
It has left him looking like something he has rarely been in his lifetime – a loser , just like everyone else .
The only winners yesterday were the bad guys ."
2009-11-02,"Afghan officials today declared Hamid Karzai the winner of the country 's disputed presidential poll after cancelling a planned runoff election .
The announcement came after Karzai 's main challenger , Abdullah Abdullah , dropped out of the race on the grounds that the vote would not be free or fair . ""
The Independent Election Commission [ IEC ] declares the esteemed Hamid Karzai as the president … because he was the winner of the first round and the only candidate in the second round , "" the commission 's chairman , Azizullah Ludin , told reporters .
"" The constitution of Afghanistan does not require any sort of turnout parameters for the second round , "" he said , adding that not holding a second round would save money .
The IEC has come under intense western pressure to swiftly name Karzai the winner and end the political uncertainty .
A legitimate Afghan leader is seen as essential to western war aims , and the lack of a credible result has prevented the US president , Barack Obama , from being able to make a decision on whether to send up to 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan .
Britain and the US both welcomed the cancellation of the runoff .
A Downing Street spokesman said Gordon Brown had telephoned Karzai to congratulate him on his victory .
"" They discussed the importance of the president moving quickly to set out a unifying programme for the future of Afghanistan , "" the spokesman said .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , who is on a surprise visit to Kabul , congratulated Karzai , but said the president should move fast to form a new administration . ""
Afghanistan now faces significant challenges and the new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community , "" he said in statement .
Abdullah announced his decision to sit out the 7 November vote yesterday after almost all his demands for changes to the IEC and the suspension of government ministers – which he said would have reduced the risk of major fraud in the next round of voting – were rejected .
Abdullah 's announcement threw the election into disarray , with some analysts describing the situation as "" a shocking failure "" of efforts by the west and other international communities to build a democracy in Afghanistan .
Abdullah told thousands of supporters he had no choice but to bow out "" because of the action taken by this government and the action taken by the IEC "" .
Both Karzai 's campaign and the commission initially said Saturday 's runoff should go ahead because there was no other legal method for choosing the president .
However , the IEC 's chief electoral officer said he was concerned about security risks and the legitimacy of the next government if Karzai was the only candidate .
"" If we go for a runoff and it did not give much legitimacy to the president and many lives are lost , it is also a concern for us , "" Daoud Ali Najafi told Reuters .
Karzai faced unenviable choices after Abdullah 's withdrawal .
Either he went ahead and won a mandate based on a second round which was likely to attract even fewer participants than the first vote in August , or he could be appointed as leader without the 50 % of votes the constitution says are required .
Senior diplomats had privately said they did not want to risk troops ' lives to protect another election .
They said there was enough ambiguity in Afghanistan 's constitution to allow the country 's supreme court to rule a second round unnecessary and that Karzai should be elected on the basis that he received the highest number of votes in the first .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said Abdullah 's decision to withdraw from the election would not affect the vote 's legitimacy .
But Nadjib Yussufi , a senior Abdullah campaign member , said that if Karzai had any "" political wisdom "" he would back the establishment of an interim government and reform of the IEC , allowing Abdullah to participate in elections in the spring .
Abdullah hinted he would consider re - entering the race if conditions for a runoff were made fairer ."
2009-11-02,"Pressure was growing on Hamid Karzai today to form a unity government after the Afghan president was declared the winner of the country 's election following the cancellation of a runoff vote .
The decision by the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) to declare Karzai president , taken just one day after his rival Abdullah Abdullah announced he would not participate in a fresh vote scheduled for Saturday , was welcomed by the west , despite doubts about the strength of Karzai 's mandate .
Diplomats and world leaders warned that he must reach out to Abdullah after the IEC , which has been heavily criticised for being biased in the president 's favour , declared that Karzai would serve another five years in office .
Ban Ki - moon , the United Nations secretary general who was in Kabul on an unannounced visit today , congratulated Karzai but said the country faced "" significant challenges "" .
"" The new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community . ""
Gordon Brown , who telephoned Karzai to congratulate him , said : "" Afghanistan now needs new and urgent measures for tackling corruption , strengthening local government and reaching out to all parts of Afghan society , and to give the Afghan people a real stake in their future . ""
Whitehall officials said tonight an extra 500 British troops that Brown has agreed in principle will reinforce the 9,000 already in southern Afghanistan will not be deployed until a new government in Kabul has been formed .
It is likely to take several weeks before what Brown called a "" national unity "" government is put together .
The US embassy also endorsed Karzai as the country 's new leader .
"" We congratulate President Karzai on his victory in this historic election and look forward to working with him , "" it said in a statement .
Obama is due to speak to Karzai by telephone tonight .
But the announcement of Karzai 's victory was immediately attacked by Abdullah 's supporters .
Saeed Rahi , a lawyer , said the IEC decision "" did not have any legal basis "" and ignored the constitutional requirement that the president must win more than 50 % of the vote .
He said : "" The constitution is quite clear on this , but this process is now a political game run by the international community . ""
The IEC claimed the country 's constitution only required a 50 % share of the vote in the first round , and because Dr Abdullah had dropped out of the race a runoff would not be necessary .
Azizullah Ludin , the IEC 's chairman , whom Abdullah had insisted should be sacked as a precondition of his participation in the second round , made the announcement at the commission 's headquarters in Kabul .
"" We declare that Mr Hamid Karzai , who won the majority of votes in the first round and is the only candidate in the second round , is the elected president of Afghanistan , "" he said .
Ludin said the decision had been taken unanimously by the IEC 's commissioners , who had also been concerned about the dire security situation in the country and the additional money that would have to be spent on another vote .
Zekria Barakzai , Ludin 's deputy , said he was "" totally disappointed "" with the way the country 's scandal - hit election had unfolded , but said there was no point in going ahead with the runoff .
"" It does not make sense to have just one candidate taking part – the people would know the results before they go to the polls , "" he said .
The IEC announcement brought to a close an election which it was once hoped would help to turn round the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan , but which is now widely regarded by observers as a fiasco .
But it did not put to bed serious questions about the legitimacy of the final outcome .
Even some of Karzai 's strongest supporters said the president was badly damaged .
"" It is a disaster because only people going out to vote can give Mr Karzai legitimacy , not the decision of a commission , "" said Shukria Barakzai , a high - profile MP who lent her support to the president .
She also criticised the international community , which is seen by many Afghans as having interfered in Afghanistan 's election , first by forcing Karzai to accept a second round of voting and then by exerting massive diplomatic pressure to force the runoff to be abandoned .
A western diplomat said that the international community hoped to use the fact that Karzai is now a "" wounded beast "" to force him to establish a national unity government . ""
Karzai knows that he can not run this country without the help and support of Abdullah , who is going to have to be rewarded with a share of the power , "" he said .
"" He has been told in no uncertain terms that unless he broadens his government and tackles corruption he will finally lose the support of the international community . """
2009-11-02,"The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , today pledged to stand by the next Afghan government as Afghanistan 's western backers pushed for a swift coronation of Hamid Karzai as president following the decision by his closest challenger to withdraw from the runoff vote .
After meeting Karzai and his main rival in the disputed August election , Abdullah Abdullah , Ban urged Afghanistan 's election authority to decide quickly on whether to press ahead with a second round on Saturday . ""
If and when the Independent Election Commission makes a decision consistent with constitutional procedures and if it is politically sustainable , the UN will support and respect that decision and will stand by the next government , "" Ban told reporters during a surprise visit .

Nick Horne , a former UN political officer who resigned over the organisation 's handling of the elections , said a second round without Abdullah would give Karzai an "" exceptionally weak mandate "" with which to counter the Taliban insurgency .
Haroun Mir , the head of the Centre for Research and Policy Studies in Kabul , said the Afghan state could even risk losing control over the northern areas in which Abdullah 's supporters might refuse to recognise the authority of Karzai .
But Waheed Omar , Karzai 's campaign spokesman , said the "" election has to go ahead and the people of Afghanistan have to be given the right to vote "" .
Senior diplomats have privately said they do not want to risk troops ' lives to protect another election .
They said there was enough ambiguity in Afghanistan 's constitution to allow the country 's supreme court to rule a second round unnecessary and that Karzai should be elected on the basis that he received the highest number of votes in the first .
However , many Afghan and western lawyers strongly disagree , saying the court does not have the power to interpret the constitution to the degree necessary .
On Saturday , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said Abdullah 's decision to withdraw from the election would not affect the vote 's legitimacy .
But Nadjib Yussufi , a senior Abdullah campaign member , said that if Karzai had any "" political wisdom "" , he would back the establishment of an interim government and reform of the IEC , allowing Abdullah to participate in elections in the spring .
Both Massoud and Abdullah hinted that the opposition candidate would consider re - entering the race if conditions for a run - off were made fairer .
Western diplomats believe that would simply prolong Afghanistan 's political limbo .
During the 108 days since the campaign period officially began in July , the government has been unable to make major decisions .
A spring election would prevent the government from taking steps foreign diplomats hope will start to deal with the country 's problems , including corruption and declining security ."
2009-11-02,"Barack Obama today shrugged off Republican accusations of dithering over Afghanistan , signalling he was not planning to rush into a decision about whether to send an extra 40,000 US troops .
This stance comes despite the Afghanistan election commission 's confirmation that President Hamid Karzai is to be given a second term .
The US president had delayed a decision on troop increases until after the expected Afghanistan election run - off on 7 November , but the withdrawal of the opposition candidate Abdullah Abdullah at the weekend put paid to that .
Asked for a comment today Obama indicated the decision might still be weeks away .
"" I 'm sure I will have some comments in the weeks to come . ""
Mitt Romney , almost certainly one of the runners for the Republican nomination for the next White House race , joined the former vice - president , Dick Cheney , in accusing Obama of dithering . ""
This Hamlet performance that we 're seeing out of the White House is very disconcerting , "" Romney told CBS . ""
The president has known about this issue for a long time .
He received the report from General [ Stanley ]
McChrystal four months ago and has not been able to make a decision .
This is very unfortunate for the people there and for our troops . ""
The White House , which has had the report since early September rather than the four months Romney suggested , says the important thing is to make the right decision , rather than a rushed one .
There had been media speculation in Washington that Obama would make the announcement after the 7 November election , but before leaving on a 10-day trip to Asia on 10 November .
Officials are now hinting the decision could be delayed until after he returns ."
2009-11-02,"Abdullah Abdullah 's move yesterday to pull out of the second round of the Afghan election was the only real option left for the main opposition candidate .
Had it been contested , the runoff would have been just as corrupt as the first round , with stuffed ballots , ghost polling stations , and supporters who voted early and often .
The fraud would have been overseen by the same network of cronies who had tried to push President Hamid Karzai through the first round , which was why the incumbent rejected Dr Abdullah 's demand to replace the chair of the so - called Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) .
This time , however , Washington wants a quick coronation , so a blind eye would have been turned to fraud .
Thus Dr Abdullah had no choice but to pull out – and he did so with some dignity , and with his credibility intact .
Which is more than can be said for the US and British governments .
Secretary of state Hillary Clinton jettisoned the respect earned on a tough diplomatic mission to Pakistan by claiming Dr Abdullah 's decision was a personal one that had nothing to do with the legitimacy of the election – even comparing it to her own withdrawal from the Democratic primaries .
Unless Mrs Clinton is retrospectively taking a jab at the man who is now her president , she must know that any such comparison is absurd .
In the same vein , western diplomats in Kabul began briefing that the 48.2 % Mr Karzai achieved in the first round provided a good enough mandate to govern .
But in truth the fraud reached well beyond that uncovered by the UN - backed Electoral Complaints Commission ; Mr Karzai 's vote share would have been lower if the commission 's terms of reference were wider .
Besides , the constitution calls for an outright majority and Mr Karzai has patently failed to achieve this .
Not only has the president emerged from this election with less legitimacy than he entered it .
By abandoning the search for the greatest number of honest votes , western countries ensnared in a bloody intervention have battered their own reputation as honest brokers among non - Pashtun Afghan voters .
The international community has overseen an election which failed its own rules , and then rubber - stamped a second term of the man responsible for that failure .
The Taliban did not need to murder UN staff to frighten voters away .
They have been turned away by Mr Karzai himself .
In appearing to condone an unconstitutional outcome , the UN has undermined its already wilting standing on the Afghan street .
The international community now places all its faith in the hope that Mr Karzai , once reanointed president , will appoint a technocratic cabinet of ministers .
Perhaps he will even prove amenable to western demands for a chief executive .
But the odds on him truly fulfilling promises to behave like a good boy must now be low indeed .
Remember , this was the man who sent western diplomats packing for attempting to bring Taliban leaders in from the cold .
He thwarted Lord Paddy Ashdown 's appointment as UN representative to co - ordinate the international aid effort , and he got away with it .
The idea that he might now accept anything other than token oversight into the corrupt working of his government is fanciful in the extreme .
It is high time that Washington realised that Mr Karzai 's interests are not its own and that yesterday 's political outcome is the worst possible one on which to base a decision to send more troops .
It is not just a question of a corrupt president .
The problem lies in the system of government itself .
Only constitutional reform , undertaken by a loya jirga ( grand assembly ) can reconstitute the legitimacy that Mr Karzai has abandoned .
Real reform will only be achieved from the bottom up , with the participation of district and provincial councils .
With Mr Karzai back in power this will never happen , and British and US troops will be dragged even deeper into a mission that has lost its way ."
2009-11-03,
2009-11-03,"Hamid Karzai vowed to tackle corruption in his government and reach out to his political opponents today , but gave no commitments to specific action in his first speech since being re - appointed as president of Afghanistan .
Speaking at the presidential palace in Kabul , Karzai echoed the commitments that his western backers had pushed him to accept , including appointing a clean government and making progress in peace negotiations with the Taliban .
He said his government would be one of national unity and hoped that "" no one feels themselves isolated from this future government "" .
But he did not offer a place in the government to his main opponent in the elections , Abdullah Abdullah , and he pointedly avoided commenting on any role for his rival .
Karzai said high - level graft had "" tainted "" the image of his government .
"" We will strive , by any means possible , to eradicate this stain , "" he said .
Western diplomats hope that his dubious political mandate will oblige Karzai to "" earn legitimacy "" by delivering services to his people and cracking down on high - level corruption , thought to be fuelling support for the Taliban .
But questions remain whether he will be capable of delivering what the foreign powers demand , particularly as he struck deals during the election campaign with a number of unsavoury powerbrokers , who will expect to be rewarded by the new government .
Highlighting the potential problems , he made his commitment to reform whilst flanked by his two vice - presidents , including Mohammad Qasim Fahim , a notorious former warlord who Karzai selected as a running mate , despite strong opposition from the international community .
Barack Obama yesterday moved to bolster Karzai 's position , saying that although the process had been "" messy "" , the "" results were in accordance with and followed the rules late down by the Afghan constitution "" .
But many Afghan leaders say that is a questionable assertion as Karzai did not receive more than 50 % of votes , which the Afghan constitution says the president must have .
Observers believe the disastrous election is likely to do lasting damage to western efforts to stabilise the country .
Interventions by western powers – first to force Karzai to accept the need for a second round , and then for it to be abandoned – have bred popular cynicism about a democratic process many Afghans now believe is controlled by foreigners .
The Taliban have been exploiting the debacle , by mocking the process and sowing fear that they would disrupt the second round through violence .
In a statement today , the movement claimed it had succeeded in its bid to block the run - off . ""
The cancellation of the second round of the election showed that decisions on Afghanistan are made in Washington and London , while the announcements are made in Kabul , "" the statement said .
"" What is astonishing is two weeks ago they were arguing that the puppet president Hamid Karzai was involved in electoral fraud … but now he is elected as president based on those same fraudulent votes , Washington and London immediately send their congratulations . """
2009-11-03,"Fears grew in Afghanistan today that supporters of the failed presidential candidate , Abdullah Abdullah , may resort to violence to protest over what they regard as a stolen election .
A close aide of Abdullah said his campaign had been overwhelmed by furious supporters , particularly in the northern provinces , registering their protests .
They urged Abdullah , who is in a delicate political position , to denounce Hamid Karzai 's reappointment as president .
Abdullah is scheduled to make a statement to reporters tomorrow in which he is expected to say the decision by the International Election Commission of Afghanistan to make Karzai president without going to a runoff was unconstitutional .
The statement will allow Abdullah to keep up pressure on Karzai by continuing to question his legitimacy but at the same time without angering the US and Britain .
The two countries have warned Abdullah they might not be prepared to work with him in the future if he does anything to incite his followers to violence .
The internal political wrangling came as the US and its allies redoubled their efforts to press Karzai to tackle endemic corruption , embark on constitutional reform , reduce cronyism and bring into his government figures such as Abdullah .
Karzai , reaffirmed as president on Monday after Abdullah pulled out of a planned election re - run on Saturday , vowed to tackle corruption and reach out to political opponents but gave no commitments to take specific action .
He did not offer a place in government to Abdullah , whom the US regard as relatively efficient and whom it would like to see installed in a senior government post .
Underlining how hard it will be to force Karzai to move towards reform , the Afghanistan president made his speech today flanked by his two vice - presidents , one , Mohammad Qasim Fahim , a notorious former warlord selected as a running mate by Karzai despite strong opposition from the international community .
The US , Britain and other allies face the same dilemma as they did before the disputed election .
They want Karzai to introduce reforms but they do not have the leverage to force him : the US has ruled out withdrawing its forces , at least until it has defeated al - Qaida and elements of the Taliban .
With the election out of the way , the US , which has little faith in Karzai , is leading an international effort to persuade him to consider shifting from a presidential system to a parliamentary one that would open the way to more players .
A parliamentary system would allow for the appointment of a prime minister to share power with Karzai .
Failing that , the US would like to see the appointment of a western - style chief executive to help run the country in tandem with Karzai .
Abdullah has to balance the demands of the US and Britain with keeping onside the supporters he attracted during the election campaign .
He could see some of that support drift away if he is seen to be acquiescing in what they regard as Karzai 's election theft .
The UN is planning to hold an international conference in Kabul to discuss Karzai 's promise to clean up a government riddled with cronyism and corruption .
No date has been set for the conference , which will be co - chaired by Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary - general , and Karzai , but the Afghan president would be under pressure to present his plans for a root and branch reform of his government .
Speaking in London after flying overnight from Kabul , Ban said he had told Karzai : "" Unless you take very bold measures to eradicate corruption it will be very difficult for you to meet the expectations of the international community . ""
Ban , who met Gordon Brown in London , denied the UN had closed its eyes to election fraud and diminished the standing of its own workers on the ground by endorsing Karzai 's re - election .
He defended his decision to sack Peter Galbraith , the former deputy head of the UN mission in Afghanistan , who had warned repeatedly that the organisation was standing idly by as officials and ministers loyal to the president organised the fraud .
Ban said he dismissed Galbraith , not because he had spoken out in public , but because he insisted on limiting the number of polling stations .
He said this contradicted a "" fundamental principle "" of the right of the Afghan voters to cast their votes ."
2009-11-04,"Abdullah Abdullah –
Hamid Karzai 's main challenger in Afghanistan 's disputed presidential election – has ruled himself out of the incoming government .
Afghanistan 's former foreign minister , who refused to take part in a runoff election , said he had no interest in joining Karzai 's cabinet and questioned the president 's ability to deliver promised reform .
"" That government can not bring legitimacy , can not fight corruption , "" Abdullah said in his first comments since Afghanistan 's election authority , the Independent Election Commission , declared Karzai the winner after Abdullah pulled out . ""
A government which is derived from such an illegal decision will not be able to deliver ...
[ It ] can not deal with all the challenges , especially the threat of terrorism , security problems , poverty , unemployment and many others . ""
The run - off was triggered by widespread fraud in the August first round .
Abdullah withdrew from the second round , citing serious concerns about further ballot rigging .
His refusal to work with Karzai is a blow to the president 's western backers who have urged him to reach out to the opposition to form a government that will enjoy popular support in an increasingly bloody war against the Taliban .
People close to Karzai and Abdullah said the two held talks over the last few weeks but failed to reach a power - sharing agreement .
Karzai said in his victory speech that he would welcome anyone from the opposition into his administration but did not make a direct appeal to Abdullah .
In his criticism of Karzai , Abdullah accused the president of wasting eight years of "" golden opportunity "" and western aid by failing to stop corruption or create a government that responded to the needs of the Afghan people .
Afghanistan needed more foreign troops in the absence of a "" credible and legitimate partner "" for the occupying forces , he said .
The US and Britain have warned Abdullah they might not be prepared to work with him if he does anything to incite his followers to violence ."
2009-11-04,"News that the people of Afghanistan would be treated to another five years of Hamid Karzai 's eccentric rule was covered in all Afghan media outlets apart from Karzai 's own mouthpiece , the state - run RTA television .
Instead of reporting Karzai 's re - election , the TV station ran a Tom and Jerry cartoon .
Given the ridiculous nature of the August 2009 elections , Tom and Jerry was a fitting response to Karzai 's "" victory "" .
After all , what is Afghan politics these days but an international comedy show , making fun of its people and future ?
The comedy started in 2001 , when Afghans were promised peace , justice and disarmament only to see warlords and local strongmen elevated to positions of power , complete with democratic titles , fancy cars and bodyguards .
In the words of a fellow Afghan and friend : "" It was like expecting Genghis Khan and his entourage to run a peaceful democracy . ""
Beards might have been shaved off and local attire replaced with western suits and ties , but the turf - war mentality of many Afghan power - holders has n't changed .
It was the same inability to compromise for the sake of Afghanistan and prioritise the people 's future over a personal and ethnic agenda that resulted in the civil wars of 1990s and the rise to power of the Taliban .
Then as now , the Taliban are the sole winners of the crisis .
The losers are the people and the country 's fragile democracy .
An editorial in Hasht - e Sobh newspaper summarised the consequences of the inadequate handling of this election for the country 's future .
The paper said the hasty declaration of Karzai 's "" victory "" amounted to saying no to democracy and democratic elections . ""
Besides , it has given the Taliban and their allies an opportunity to claim that the people of Afghanistan are not ready for democracy and that a return to traditional forms of leadership is the sole viable solution . ""
The paper said that cancelling the runoff on the grounds of security and other problems had set a dangerous precedence .
"" Who can guarantee that the same reasons of saving costs and other problems will not be used as an excuse in the future to disregard democracy altogether ? ""
Hasht - e Sobh reflects the views of those Afghans who believe that no cost should have been considered too expensive , no challenge too overwhelming to ensure a decent election because democracy is the only viable solution for Afghanistan .
In other words , dismissing democratic principles for the sake of short - term expediency is not going to work out in the long term because all it does is prepare the ground for a return of totalitarianism .
And yet this is exactly what 's happened in Afghanistan , though this time with the support of the international community .
One could go a step further and claim that the international community has been Afghanised .
After all , mutiny inside the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and constant bickering between various Nato countries and a dithering Washington are all but a mirror image of Afghan politics .
Be that as it may , the 2009 election was a historical event in that it revealed just how profoundly inadequate the country 's leadership was in handling a crisis .
Hence , disappointment has set in even among those who displayed unwavering support for the two main candidates .
Karzai 's supporters have no choice but to admit that by agreeing to the runoff , the president has further compromised his independence and is left with little choice but to make concessions to the country 's international allies .
As a result , many Afghans believe that foreigners are now officially running the show in Afghanistan .
Given the growing anti - western sentiment in the country , this is not an enviable position for the president to be in .
The Taliban have already declared him a western puppet , the rest of the country is now agreeing with them .
Abdullah Abdullah 's supporters have been equally let down .
They now have to face the following question : given that everybody , including Abdullah , knew that fraud was bound to happen during the 2009 elections , why did he decide to run a campaign to begin with ?
Why did n't he retreat , giving a chance for other candidates who would have faced up to a runoff ?
In other words , why kick up a massive fuss only to chicken out in the last minute ?
As it turned out , in the historical 2009 election the people of Afghanistan voted for a cheat and a chicken respectively and the only reasonable explanation for this irrational decision is the country 's obsession with ethnicised politics .
As long as politicians are supported in return for the sole quality of representing this or that ethnicity , Afghans would be fools to expect any other outcome but a ridiculous comedy show plunging the country into further crisis .
To build a decent state and run a democracy , the Afghan leadership must work on nation - building so that the people vote for qualities other than ethnicity .
After all , Afghanistan 's core problem is that it 's a country without a nation ."
2009-11-06,"Gordon Brown today denounced the Afghan government as corrupt and warned the president , Hamid Karzai , that he would lose international support if he failed to improve its performance .
In a speech to the Royal College of Defence Studies , the prime minister said he was "" not prepared to put the lives of British men and women in harm 's way for a government that does not stand up against corruption "" .
The remarks drew criticism that Britain 's role in Afghanistan was being made hostage to the behaviour of a government that Brown himself described as "" a byword for corruption "" .
The shadow defence secretary , Liam Fox , said Britain 's commitment to the conflict should not be "" confused by mixed messages or empty threats "" .
Fox said : "" We must put pressure on the Karzai government to improve governance and tackle corruption , but if our mission in Afghanistan is a national security imperative , it ca n't be conditional on the behaviour of others . ""
Whitehall officials said Brown 's ultimatum did not imply a threatened withdrawal of British troops but rather a withholding of political support if Karzai did not improve his government in five areas laid out in the speech .
Those five benchmarks were the provision of security for the Afghan population , improving governance by combating corruption and appointing qualified officials , political reconciliation with opponents , providing economic development and stabilising relations with the country 's neighbours .
"" If the government fails to meet these five tests , it will not only have failed its people , it will have forfeited its right to international support , "" Brown said .
An early measure of Karzai 's commitment to change will come at his inauguration , due in the next few weeks .
The president , starting a new term after a highly contentious election , is expected to purge his government of its most corrupt officials and replace them with technocrats and representatives of Afghanistan 's major ethnic groups .
Karzai is also expected to create an anti - corruption commission involving some oversight from the international community .
In his speech , Brown talked about the need for an "" international adviser of substance "" to work with the Karzai government on anti - corruption measures .
Downing Street referred to this as an "" anti - corruption tsar "" , but refused to discuss whether Lord Ashdown would be a candidate .
"" There are a number of potential candidates for the post , "" the spokesman said .
The prime minister gave the speech at the end of a particularly lethal week for British troops , with seven killed , including five soldiers shot by one of the Afghan policemen they were mentoring .
The losses brought the total British death toll since 2001 to 230 .
Elizabeth Chant , the mother of one of the five killed , Warrant Officer Class 1 Darren Chant , called for a withdrawal .
She told the BBC : "" Darren would n't have me say anything bad , but I do think that those boys should come home now because there 's too many being killed . ""
A Channel 4 News poll revealed a spike in public opposition to the war over the last fortnight , with 35 % of respondents calling for immediate withdrawal , up from 25 % two weeks ago .
The poll echoes public nervousness in the US , where Barack Obama is due to announce in the next few weeks how many more American troops to dispatch for his commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal .
Nato allies met in Brussels today to approve the strategy recommended by McChrystal , which focuses on providing protection for Afghan civilians and helping to provide better governance .
Each capital has been asked to increase its military , civilian and financial commitment to Afghanistan .
Some member states are understood to have privately given provisional undertakings , pending Obama 's announcement .
Brown has said he will send 500 more troops , bringing the British contingent to 9,500 , if three main conditions are met : they are properly equipped , other Nato states take more of the military burden , and the Kabul government provides more Afghan army recruits .
Lord Guthrie , the former chief of defence staff , accused the government of "" dithering "" . ""
The three conditions laid down by the prime minister for their movement reveal a complete lack of understanding of what these men are for , "" he said .
A Downing Street spokesman said that to deploy the extra troops without any certainty over their equipment and circumstances of their deployment "" would be a dereliction of duty "" ."
2009-11-08,"The news from Afghanistan has been grim .
The collapse of the second round of the national elections ; Hamid Karzai 's government tainted by corruption ; and , last week , five British soldiers killed by a rogue Afghan policeman in Nad - e'Ali .
All the while , Washington continues to dither over its strategy .
Small wonder that the British public have lost faith in this war : 57 % now think it unwinnable .
However , on the ground in Afghanistan things look a little more optimistic .
I have just spent two weeks in Helmand , talking to dozens of civilian stabilisation advisers and military officers .
Predictably , everybody complains about the shortage of helicopters ( with good reason ) .
But local governance has been reestablished this past year in the key district centres of Garmsir , Gereshk and Nad - e'Ali .
And though the formal justice system has been slow to take root because of the difficulties of putting judges and prosecutors in district centres , in its place an informal justice system has developed supported by international advisers .
In all districts , schools and health clinics are being built or refurbished .
And even in the area of counter - narcotics , there are some encouraging signs .
Poppy cultivation is down 37 % this year in Helmand .
A significant increase in poppy cultivation in neighbouring Kandahar suggests that this reduction is not simply due to market forces .
In Helmand , a wheat seed distribution programme ( which encourages farmers to grow wheat instead of poppy)is covering more farmers .
Often the best solutions in Afghanistan are local ones .
Notwithstanding the tragic events in Nad - e'Ali , the Afghan security forces are getting better , as is the partnership between Afghans and the International Security Assistance Force .
I saw this most visibly in Garmsir , where I spent some time with the US marines .
Garmsir district centre has tarmac roads , solar streetlights and a thriving bazaar .
US - run Radio Garmsir pumps out popular programming courtsey of its two local DJs ; it also receives over 1,000 letters a month from listeners .
Most striking of all , the marines trust Afghan police and soldiers to secure the district centre .
Garmsir feels very much like a society that is shaking off the shackles of war .
So what accounts for this success ?
First , an offensive by the marines in collaboration with the Afghan armyover September and October , that pushed the Taliban lines far south of Snakeshead ( the main population and agricultural area , extending far beyond the district centre ) .
This created the perception of security that underpins local support for the government .
It also gave locals the confidence to send their children to school , to trade in the bazaar and return to normal life .
The US marines ' campaign in Garmsir has built on foundations laid by British military operations and stabilisation efforts .
But the British lacked the forces to hold captured territory .
The marines have created outposts and stayed .
Such commitment is crucial to Afghan confidence .
Second , security operations are a true partnership between the marines and the Afghan security forces .
I observed the marine commander signing up to an Afghan security plan for the elections , and deferring to a shura of local leaders in deciding the fate of eight men the marines hadapprehended planting a roadside bomb .
Finally , contrary to stereotype , the marines have been more concerned about making peace than making war .
To be sure , the campaign in Garmsir has involved a lot of hard fighting by marines ( and the British army before them ) .
But as Lt Col Cabaniss put it , the main effort for his battalion has focused on expanding the "" hope bubble "" and "" restarting civilian society "" .
The events in Nad - e - Ali are unquestionably a setback .
But they will have little impact on the success stories like Garmsir .
Garmsir highlights the importance of nurturing effective local government , and of boots on the ground .
Most of all , Garmsir underlines the importance of partnership between international and Afghan security forces .
Garmsir enjoys an advantage here in that the local army , police and national security chiefs are all professional and work well together .
As Nad - e - Ali suggests , police quality , especially of the lower ranks , is a key priority .
There is a new police academy opening in the provincial capital , Lashkar Gah , to provide basic and specialist training to police throughout Helmand .
There is much to be done in Helmand , especially in towns such as Sangin and Musa Qala , where the Taliban still threaten security .
But on the ground , one can begin to see the green shoots of progress and , in Garmsir , the conditions of stability and Britain 's eventual withdrawal ."
2009-11-08,"Growing frustration among Britain 's most senior military commanders over the government 's handling of the war in Afghanistan burst into the open today as they stepped up plans to restrict the number of areas where British troops will be deployed .
As two more soldiers died in Helmand province – making a total of nine deaths in the last week – defence chiefs expressed concern at what they see as mixed messages from the government over the purpose of their mission .
They believe the public is not convinced British troops can succeed and are unclear whether the mission is to protect the UK , to clean up Afghan president Hamid Karzai 's administration or make life better for Afghans .
The latest deaths take the number of British troops who have died since the war began to 232 .
A soldier from 4th Battalion , The Rifles , died in an explosion near Sangin , in Helmand province on the morning of Remembrance Sunday .
Another soldier , from the 2nd Battalion , The Rifles , but serving with the 4th Battalion , died after a blast near Sangin on Saturday .
Amid increasing Whitehall turmoil , defence chiefs and ministers are expressing growing impatience at the time Barack Obama is taking to decide how many more US troops will be deployed to Afghanistan and the priorities behind a new strategy .
The US army 's chief of staff , General George Casey , renewed an appeal for more troops .
He told NBC 's Meet the Press that additional forces would help push back the Taliban .
That Casey felt able to comment on the need for more troops suggests a decision from the president may be in the balance , as the last time a senior officer made similar remarks , it led to him being publicly rebuked .
General Stanley McChrystal , the top US commander in Afghanistan , was slapped down after he warned that failure to send up to 40,000 more troops could lead to failure in Afghanistan .
According to the McClatchy news service , White House and military officials have said privately that Obama is close to making a decision to send 34,000 more troops and will be consulting key allies over the next couple of weeks , including at a Nato meeting on 23 November .
The decision will influence the attitude of other countries , including Germany and Canada , which have significant numbers of troops in Afghanistan as well as deciding when an extra 500 British troops will be deployed to join 9,000 already there .
Lieutenant General Jim Dutton , the deputy commander of Nato - led forces in Afghanistan , told BBC1 's Politics Show : "" British soldiers are not dying simply to provide an electoral opportunity for Afghans . ""
Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , the chief of defence staff , warned : "" I do think it is incredibly important that we do better at describing to people the success that we are having , to demonstrate that over the long term that this is do - able . ""
Stirrup told BBC1 's Andrew Marr Show that progress was "" painful , slow and halting "" , but he said the troops doing the fighting believed they were gaining ground .
Stirrup has been accused privately by former defence chiefs of not taking a sufficiently robust stand with Gordon Brown .
As a ComRes poll for the BBC found 64 % of the public felt that the war was unwinnable , up from 58 % in July , Stirrup warned that it could be another five years before Afghan forces were ready to take over responsibility for security themselves .
He said the "" al - Qaida core "" had suffered significant damage and was no longer operating in Afghanistan .
But it was essential to keep up the pressure .
Stirrup confirmed that British troops would now concentrate on the most populated areas .
However , he said there were no plans to withdraw from Musa Qala , a commercial centre in Helmand recaptured from the Taliban by the British after heavy fighting in 2007 . ""
Since this a counter - insurgency , you have to focus on the population .
It is the people that matter , not the geography , "" Stirrup said .
Dutton said public support was "" crucially important "" to the success of the mission .
"" I think the British people , and indeed all our populations back home , will put up with the cost of this sort of operation ... if they believe we 're right and that we can win , "" he told the BBC ."
2009-11-12,"The US ambassador in Kabul has warned against plans to send tens of thousands more troops to Afghanistan , until President Hamid Karzai 's government demonstrates that it is willing to tackle the corruption .
Karl Eikenberry sent two classified cables to Washington in the past week expressing his concern over proposals to deploy as many as 40,000 extra troops while the Karzai government remains dogged by accusations of incompetence and corruption , according to reports from Washington .
The existence of the memos was revealed as Barack Obama held a war council at the White House to discuss the final four options for deployment of extra US troops in an effort to stave off defeat at the hands of the Taliban .
Eikenberry is a former US commander in Afghanistan and his caution over a further troop build - up puts him at odd with senior generals in the Pentagon .
The BBC said today that it had been told Eikenberry had gone so far as to say it was "" not a good idea "" to send more troops .
Officials said a troop increase has been agreed in principle and what was left to be resolved was the number and how they would fit into the existing strategic aims .
The US commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , has asked for 40,000 extra US troops for Afghanistan on top of the 68,000 that will have been deployed by the end of the year , and warned that without them the US was staring at defeat .
The New York Times reported that Eikenberry 's reservations were raised last week , and that Obama and his security advisers have examined an option that would send about 10 - 15,000 new troops , most designated as trainers for Afghan forces .
The ' low - end ' option joined alternatives calling for troop level rises of around 20,000 , 30,000 or 40,000 , according to the paper , which said it had talked to three senior US officials on the issue .
Obama involved Eikenberry in the White House discussions as he sought to establish how long it would take to see results in Afghanistan and to be able to withdraw forces . ""
He wants to know where the off - ramps are "" , one official was quoted as saying .
Administration officials said Obama had repeatedly asked whether a large American force might undermine the objective of training Afghan security forces and persuading them to fight on their own .
A statement issued by the White House after the latest meeting appeared to reflect Eikenberry 's concerns , the Washington Post suggested .
"" The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open - ended .
After years of substantial investments by the American people , governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time . ""
But none of the scenarios contemplated at yesterday 's meeting called for the scaling back of the US presence or delaying the sending of extra troops .
The Wall Street Journal said a potential compromise is to deploy 30,000 - 35,000 extra US troops , of which about 10,000 would be trainers for the Afghan army , in the hope of speeding up the transfer of responsibility from international forces to the Afghans .
The New York Times reported that this option had gained the support of the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , and the defence secretary , Robert Gates .
Obama has been accused by Republicans of dithering and this was the eighth meeting of the war cabinet .
But the White House has responded that he wants to get it right , and contrasts his patient approach with the rush to war under his predecessor , George Bush .
Obama is scheduled to arrive in Japan tomorrow at the start of a nine - day tour of east Asia , including visits to Singapore , South Korea and Japan .
It is unlikely he will make the announcement while abroad , as the White House said he wants to explain his decision to the US public .
Obama returns to the US on 19 November and could make the announcement the following day .
If he delays , the week after sees the Thanksgiving holiday , and that could see the announcement delayed until the first week in December .
Officials said that while a troop increase has been agreed in principle , the exact figure is still to be resolved .
The discussions were not about a new strategy for Afghanistan but about how to implement the one announced in the spring , they said .
The strategy announced in spring set out the prime US aims to disrupt al - Qaida and the Taliban , and that nation - building was secondary to that .
As well as US lack of confidence in Karzai , there is disappointment that European forces have been reluctant to send reinforcements .
As a secondary position , Washington has been asking allies unable to send forces to at least provide financial help ."
2009-11-15,"Western soldiers are to begin investigating high - profile Afghans suspected of involvement in what one American official describes as a "" criminal mafia state "" in a sign of the growing international exasperation with Hamid Karzai 's failure to crack down on corruption .
A taskforce being established by Nato in Kabul will consist of a small team of anti - corruption officers , as well as a criminal investigator and prosecutor who hope senior generals will be able to stop cases being derailed by opposition from the Afghan government .
Details of the body emerged as the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said Washington had called on Karzai to create a "" major crimes tribunal "" and an anti - corruption commission . ""
Now that the election is finally over , we 're looking to see tangible evidence that the government , led by the president but going all the way down to the local level , will be more responsive to the needs of the people , "" Clinton said today .
Her comments reflect growing impatience among Karzai 's western backers at his apparent unwillingness to tackle corruption .
Earlier this month , Gordon Brown warned the Afghan president that he would lose international support if he failed to improve its performance .
Law enforcement officials in Kabul hope the anti - corruption body will replicate the structure of the British - backed counter - narcotics taskforce , which was set up to investigate , hold and convict high - value drug traffickers in a secure facility where judges can be kept safe from retributions .
An official involved in the scheme said there will also be a separate body responsible for drawing up a "" target list for judicial action and a watch list of people we 're suspicious of "" .
Information gathered by Nato will then be handed over to the major crimes taskforce , a wing of Afghanistan 's intelligence service but trained by the FBI and Britain 's Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) .
The need for such a body , dubbed the "" Afghan FBI "" , has been highlighted by the breakthrough arrest in October of a top police officer in the southern province of Kandahar after an investigation into thousands of "" ghost salaries "" of non - existent policemen under his command .
The arrest of the officer , who can not be named until the conclusion of his trial , was greeted with alarm by the interior minister , Hanif Atmar , who has so far refused to claim credit for the unprecedented arrest of such a senior official .
"" It was a fascinating example where the interests of a criminal syndicate clearly weighed more important in the minister 's mind than the demands of the international community to clean up corruption , "" said a US official involved in the anti - corruption push .
The US ambassador in Kabul , Karl Eikenberry , is so sceptical about Karzai 's commitment to tackling corruption and crime and reforming his government that he has advised Barack Obama not to send any additional troops .
One US official said Karzai 's government is "" structured like a criminal syndicate "" , extracting money from the people in the form of bribes , stolen customs revenues and imprisoning people for ransom . ""
Afghans see us
[ the International Security Assistance Force ] as being the enforcement mechanism for the mafia .
That 's why people get driven towards the Taliban –
it 's the only way to express your outrage at this stuff , "" the official said .
Last week Karzai horrified observers when he attempted to justify his decision in July to pardon convicted drug dealers , one of whom was related to a member of his re - election campaign team .
In an interview on US television , Karzai argued that he had to release the man as he was under pressure from western governments to release Sayed Pervez Kambaksh , a journalism student accused in 2007 of insulting Islam .
But whereas the drug traffickers were convicted with the help of western law enforcement agencies and judges mentored by British lawyers , the Kambaksh case was criticised from the start for flouting legal procedures .
Even a close colleague of Karzai said the president was "" struggling to justify the unjustifiable "" .
Previous attempts by Afghan authorities to deal with corruption have been disappointing , including the high office of oversight , an entity set up largely for the purpose of demonstrating to international donors that something was being done about corruption .
Western legal officials criticise it for being toothless and not independent of the president , who appointed its senior staff .
Ershad Ahmadi , the deputy head of the organisation and one of the president 's close advisers , says a good relationship with the presidential palace is vital to ensure "" people take us seriously "" .
But Ahmadi said that despite constant reminders , no one in the presidential palace , except for Karzai himself , have yet completed the asset registration forms which are constitutionally mandated for all senior ministers and officials .
He argued that the system of government needs to be reformed to make it less open to abuse .
He also said 100 top government officials should be removed from their posts , to "" short - cut the process of building confidence in the government "" .
The international community has also been putting resources into an anti - corruption unit , within the attorney general 's office , an effort western officials say is paying dividends and should lead to high - profile arrests in the coming weeks , although some cases are currently blocked by a legal provision preventing the arrest of serving provincial governors .
But Gerard Russell , a former senior diplomat at the both the British and UN missions in Kabul , believes only foreign prosecutors immune from intimidation by Afghan criminals need to be drafted in to help to clean up the government .
"" Getting Al Capone took a federal grand jury – if you can have outsiders doing the work of denouncing corrupt officials , they can do it more safely and fearlessly , "" he said ."
2009-11-19,
2009-11-19,"Hamid Karzai was sworn in for a second term as Afghanistan 's president today at a tightly guarded ceremony in Kabul attended by western leaders keen to hear him set out reforms and a programme for tackling corruption .
His inauguration follows an election blighted by fraud and comes at time of growing public doubt in Europe and America about why Nato forces are fighting an increasingly bloody war in Afghanistan .
The US , UK and other frustrated Nato countries urged Karzai to use his inauguration speech announce a government clean - up .
The foreign secretary David Miliband , who was due to arrive in Kabul last night , said : "" We shall be there to act as witnesses to what should be a new contract between President Karzai and people . ""
In the Commons yesterday , the opposition leader , David Cameron , called on the government to adopt a "" much tougher approach "" to Karzai .
Speaking before her arrival in Afghanistan , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , warned that the US would withdraw civilian aid to Afghanistan if it failed to ensure government spending was accountable .
A European diplomat told Reuters that several nations had given Karzai a "" shopping list "" of what he needed to do , including reaching out to his political enemies and combating corruption .
This month Gordon Brown said he wanted Karzai to commit to reforms covering five areas – security , governance , political reconciliation , economic development and relations with neighbouring countries .
Western diplomats leaned on the Afghan president for weeks before he accepted that the fraud - riddled election results had not given him the 50 % support needed to win outright .
Karzai was declared the winner after his only remaining opponent , Abdullah Abdullah , dropped out because he said there was no way a runoff vote could be fair .
Representatives from 42 countries were scheduled to attend the ceremony , which was held inside the presidential palace with tight restrictions on those allowed in .
Since an assassination attempt on Karzai at a public parade in 2008 , he has avoided large public appearances .
Those due to attend included the Pakistani president , Asif Ali Zardari .
Traditionally difficult relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have improved since Pakistan 's elected government led by Zardari replaced the military rule of Pervez Musharraf .
The two leaders , who have established a personal relationship , last met in Turkey in April .
Afghanistan still routinely accuses Pakistan of harbouring Taliban leaders , while Pakistan complains about the increased influence wielded by its hostile neighbour India in Afghanistan .
The government has declared today a national holiday and has asked the public to stay home to help traffic flow on the capital 's clogged roads .
Regular flights to and from Kabul airport will be cancelled for the day .
A number of neighbourhoods in Kabul have been closed completely to traffic , with exceptions made only for ambulances .
Helicopters circled the city , providing surveillance ."
2009-11-19,"To everyone 's surprise the ceremony began on time , the president walking up a stained , blotchy red carpet to the sound of a rough brass band and thumping drums .
Looking immaculate , as he always does , Hamid Karzai 's striped green silk Uzbek cloak stood out in the cold sunshine of a Kabul winter 's morning .
Even his dress was calculated : items from around the country assembled in a show of national unity .
What followed was part splendid , part shabby and awkward for everyone .
An event to be endured not necessarily enjoyed . ""
Sober not triumphant , "" said David Miliband , the foreign secretary , after the inauguration .
Afghan eyes darted around the long hall to see who was invited and who was not .
Western officials sat judging whether the president had said enough about a less corrupt future to excuse the disgrace of his rigged re - election .
The verdict was that he had , just about , passed the test .
He mostly stuck to the script demanded by the western powers whose representatives sat in the front row at the president 's feet as he spoke .
His language about corruption was expected – "" the ministers of Afghanistan must possess integrity "" – though it said much about the degraded state of the government that such a banal statement could be taken as progress .
The west will now want to hold him to the promise .
"" Deeds , not words , "" became the catchphrase of the day .
But Karzai went further than some had predicted .
He said he wanted security control of Afghanistan within five years .
He also called for full reconciliation among its people .
In Helmand province , at least , such things are still distant dreams .
Today 's event was an edgy affair in a city sealed off for the day against a feared insurgent attack that did not materialise .
Any merchant trying to enter Kabul was turned away and the airport was shut .
The declaration of a public holiday kept people indoors ; the streets were quiet , some Afghans at least following the presidential speech as it was covered , Dimbleby - style , by a discussion panel on state television .
The event mattered at least as much to western powers who have thrown billions , and many lives , into Afghanistan and need a return on their investment .
In the hall Miliband , wearing headphones for simultaneous translation , sat to the side , his fingers on his lips .
Hillary Clinton looked regal , outshining everyone apart from Karzai .
Before the president arrived everyone wanted a word : Bernard Kouchner , the French foreign minister , and the Afghan women 's minister circled her .
America 's decision on troop numbers matters more than anything else here .
A couple of comic moments broke the mood : the wobbly Pashto of the two vice - presidents – both former jihad leaders from the north – as they were being sworn in and the late arrival of the United Arab Emirates foreign minister midway through Karzai 's speech , when every seat , but the president 's , was full .
He broke into English to direct the minister to his own prominent position on the front row , "" you can even sit there permanently "" .
Karzai seemed oblivious to the tension , though he must have been aware of it after an outspoken 90-minute session with Clinton the night before the ceremony .
Her message : buck up your act .
But in the morning the Salam Khana Palace was full of feigned politeness .
It was striking the president paid tribute to the sacrifices of US soldiers , but not British ones .
Despite recent heavy casualties in Helmand , he lumped Britain in with the rest of the EU , before naming Canada and Australia .
It might not have been meant as a snub , but some might take it as such .
As at a wedding , the guest list said a lot .
Sitting in the second row was General Dostum , a military commander briefly exiled from Kabul with a reputation for viciousness even in a room of tough military men .
His presence in a Karzai cabinet – yet to be announced – might prove a problem for the west .
The defence minister , General Abdul Rahim Wardak , whose congeniality belies his role in the destruction of Kabul in 1992 , introduced the president and organised the event .
Ashraf Ghani , the former finance minister and defeated presidential candidate , was there too .
So was Asif Zardari , the Pakistani president , a sign of improved relations .
But there were striking absences .
Two opposition figures , Burhanuddin Rabbani , and Abdullah Abdullah – beaten by Karzai for the presidency in a contest that can now described by the west as legitimate only because the latter pulled out – were missing .
"" It was a great sight to see all the tribes , a great gathering of the clans , "" Miliband said afterwards – the huge diversity of faces also underlining Afghanistan 's unwanted importance to the world .
The event would have been striking if only for the variety of headgear : flat felt hats , turbans , military caps .
But it mattered for much more than that : a moment if not of hope , then at least of possibility .
Miliband reported one Afghan cabinet minister telling him "" the next five years will define the next 100 in Afghanistan"".Today , , at least , in a sealed city , it felt like that might be true ."
2009-11-19,"President Karzai I became President Karzai II this morning at an inauguration ceremony that was part splendid , part shabby and awkward for everyone .
This was an event to be endured not enjoyed – "" sober not triumphant , "" said the foreign secretary , David Miliband , afterwards .
Afghan eyes darted around the long hall to see who was invited and who was not .
Western officials sat judging whether the president had said enough about a less corrupt future to excuse the disgrace of his rigged re - election .

He mostly stuck to the script demanded by the western powers whose representatives sat in the front row at the president 's feet .
Karzai 's language about corruption was expected : "" The ministers of Afghanistan must possess integrity . ""
He went further than some had feared , though , in two areas .
He announced that he wanted security in all parts of the country to be Afghan - led within five years which , if delivered , would mean a diminution in the western military presence .
He also stressed the need for reconciliation – diplomatic code in Afghanistan for engagement with mid- and high - level insurgent leaders and winning over poorly paid peasant fighters on the ground .
This matters .
"" The aim is we get to the stage where people flip , "" said Miliband later , admitting that "" reconciliation of high - level commanders in the insurgency is tougher to achieve .
They are more likely to have been linked to global jihad . ""
Today 's ceremony was an edgy affair in a city sealed off for the day .
Any merchant trying to enter was turned away ; the airport was closed .
The declaration of a public holiday kept people indoors ; the streets were quiet , many Afghans following the presidential speech as it was covered , Dimbleby - style , by a discussion panel on Afghan state television .
Today represents a testing point for western powers who have thrown billions of pounds , and many lives , into Afghanistan and now need a return on their investment .
In the ceremony hall Miliband , wearing headphones for simultaneous translation , sat to the side , leaning forward and looking serious , his fingers on his lips .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , looked regal , outshining everyone apart from Karzai himself .
Before the Afghan president arrived everyone wanted a word with her : Bernard Kouchner , the French foreign minister , and the Afghan women 's minister circled .

The defence minister , General Wardak , whose congeniality belies his prominent role in the fall and destruction of Kabul in 1992 , introduced the president and organised the event .
Ashraf Ghani , the former finance minister and defeated presidential candidate was there , too .
So was the new Pakistani president , Asif Zardari , a sign of improved relations considering Karzai and former Pakistani leader President Pervez Musharraf could not hide their enmity .
But there were striking absences , too .
Two opposition figures stayed away : Burhanuddin Rabbani , and Abdullah Abdullah , who was beaten by Karzai for the presidency in a contest that can now described by the west as legitimate only because the latter pulled out .
Nato powers hope he will be offered , and that he accepts , some role , though a place in a Karzai cabinet is unlikely .
Nonetheless "" it was a great sight to see all the tribes , a great gathering of the clans "" , Miliband said afterwards .
The hall was crowded , the huge diversity of faces underlining Afghanistan 's importance in the world .
The event would have been striking if only for the immense variety of headgear worn : flat felt hats , turbans , military caps .
But it mattered for much more than that : Miliband reported one Afghan cabinet minister telling him : "" The next five years will define the next 100 in Afghanistan . ""
Today , it felt like that might be true ."
2009-11-19,"In dwelling on the need to combat corruption , to talk to the Taliban and to transfer control of policing Afghanistan from foreign troops to the country 's own security institutions , Hamid Karzai did enough to appease the US and its allies , who regarded his inauguration speech as a key test of the newly reappointed president .
US officials say Karzai has been given six months to clean up his government , with the clock starting from the inauguration .
But there were several reminders , including a subtle dig at the much disliked British presence in the country , that Karzai remains a man who does not like to be pushed around .
The UK , the second - biggest troop contributor , did not warrant a mention as Karzai name - checked the many other countries risking lives and spending vast amounts of money propping up a weak government .
Leaving the UK off such a list is a trick he has pulled before , much to the fury of British generals .
Karzai made a point of praising the Independent Election Commission , the Afghan - led body that ran the 20 August election that turned into such a disaster for the country .
He called for the further "" Afghanisation "" of the country 's electoral institutions .
A bill currently before parliament will see the removal from the election watchdog of foreigners , whose insistence on an investigation of millions of dodgy ballots infuriated Karzai .
The absence of such international commissioners could crush any hopes for the forthcoming parliamentary , district and mayoral elections Karzai mentioned in his speech .
Afghanisation will be far more welcome among the international community in areas such as security , where Karzai promised that by the end of his term in office the Afghan army and police will have taken lead responsibility everywhere in the country .
He devoted a substantial portion of time to tackling corruption but there was no bold initiative , rather a repeat of measures already in place .
He promised to beef up the High Office of Oversight ( HOO ) , a toothless body set up last year in response to the last round of international clamour for something to be done .
Karzai pledged that all ministers , governors and senior officials would have to declare their assets .
Public servants on meagre official salaries will have to explain their Kabul mansions and luxury cars .
But the requirement to declare assets has been compulsory for years and the deputy head of HOO , which is in charge of collecting the written declarations , complains that it has been impossible to get anyone from Karzai 's own office to fill them in .
The president is anxious to regain his reputation as a national unifier .
In his speech he paid tribute to Ashraf Ghani , one of his vanquished rivals in the election , who turned up to the ceremony in the presidential palace in Kabul .
But absent from the event was Abdullah Abdullah , the runner - up candidate who has denounced Karzai 's reappointment as president without a second round of voting as illegal .
Despite promises that Karzai will lead a government of national unity , it appears unlikely that such an administration will include Abdullah , who says he is committed to heading up the official opposition .
Karzai will want to ensure his international backers do not switch allegiance ."
2009-11-19,"Hamid Karzai called for Afghan forces to assume responsibility for unstable areas in three years and to take complete control of security within five , in an inauguration speech closely monitored by the international community this morning .
After being sworn in for a second five - year term as president , Karzai promised to tackle corruption by prosecuting government officials and ending a culture of impunity .
Dignitaries from more than 40 countries , including the Pakistani president , Asif Ali Zardari , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , and the British foreign secretary , David Miliband , attended the ceremony in Kabul . ""
Afghanistan wants to lead operations in non - secure areas in the next three years , "" Karzai said , adding that Afghan forces should be able to take control of security within five years .
But even as Karzai pledged to make the country safe from the Taliban , two US soldiers and 10 Afghan civilians were killed in separate suicide bomb attacks .
The president stressed he wanted "" expert "" and competent ministers in his government , and pledged to crack down on corrupt officials .
He described corruption as a "" dangerous enemy of the state "" .
In his speech , Karzai also called for national unity and invited his political opponents to join his government .
He pledged to set up a loya jirga , a traditional grand assembly , which under Afghanistan 's constitution could take precedence over all government institutions including the presidency itself .
Karzai 's inauguration followed an election process blighted by fraud , which only ended after his main rival , Abdullah Abdullah , pulled out of a runoff , saying it was impossible for the vote to be fair .
In his speech Karzai reached out to his opponents .
"" I would like to invite all the presidential candidates , including my brother Dr Abdullah Abdullah , to come together to achieve the important task of national unity , and make our common home , Afghanistan , proud and prosperous , "" he said .
His call for national unity was rejected by the Taliban . ""
Today is not a historic day .
This is a government based on nothing because of the continuing presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan , "" spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told the Association Press . ""
Karzai 's call to the Taliban to come to the government has no meaning .
He became president through fraud and lies , "" Mujahid said .
Initial foreign reaction was positive .
"" This was a speech with the right emphases .
It fulfilled our expectations , "" said Germany 's foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle .
"" We will take President Karzai at his word and expect that the right words will be followed by the right doings . ""
Sima Samar , the head of Afghanistan 's human rights commission , said the speech struck the right tone of reform but that the Karzai government would not be able to succeed without the help of its international allies .
"" He can deliver if there is a political will but not just on his part , also on the part of the international community , "" Samar said .
Before the ceremony , the US , UK and other frustrated Nato countries had urged Karzai to use his inauguration speech announce a government clean - up .
"" We are asking that they follow through on much of what they have previously said , including putting together a credible anti - corruption governmental entity , "" Clinton told reporters en route to Kabul .
"" They 've done some work on that , but in our view , not nearly enough to demonstrate a seriousness of purpose to tackle corruption . ""
In his speech Karzai said : "" We are trying our best to implement social , judicial and administrative reforms in our country , "" Being a president is a heavy task and we will try our best to honestly fulfil this task in the future . ""
Karzai promised that his administration would seriously fight drug traffickers .
Around 800 people were at the ceremony at the presidential palace , and tight restrictions were in place over who was allowed in .
Since an assassination attempt on Karzai at a parade in 2008 , he has avoided large public appearances ."
2009-11-19,"6.50am : Karzai has appeared in a dark green robe and his trademark hat .
He listens to a military band and then makes his way up a red carpet on his way to the presidential palace .
Some of the world leaders have been waiting for him to appear for more than two hours , according to al - Jazeera .
Afghan TV is providing live pictures of the ceremony .
It is the only broadcaster that has been allowed in .
Western government are anxious for Karzai to set out a new beginning in Afghanistan .
7.00am :
The Guardian 's chief leader writer , Julian Glover , is in Kabul and is sending updates from his mobile .
Outside the ceremony he says there are huge crowds of western and Afghan faces all peering to see who Hillary Clinton is talking to .
The media have been banned from the ceremony he says .
Last night the US secretary of state dined with Karzai .
She said Karzai had a "" window of opportunity "" to crack down on corruption and respond to Afghan and international concerns .
Afghan TV pictures show that Karzai has now made his way to the hall .
The ceremony is being hosted by the minister of defence .
It begins with readings from the Qur'an .

He describes the election as a "" great step towards democracy and people power "" , according to a translation by the BBC .
7.21am :
"" We must learn from past elections to make sure that future elections are entirely Afghan , "" he says .
7.22am :
Karzai invites his election opponents including Abdullah Abdullah , who pulled out of the runoff over concerns about corruption , to work for the future of Afghanistan .
7.25am : ""
An end to fighting is the top of our agenda "" Karzai says .
He calls for a National Jirga to bring peace quickly .
7.27am :
We will decrease the role of international forces , he says .
Within the next five years Afghan 's security should be entirely in the hands of Afghans .
We also want to put an end to the role of private security companies , he announces .
7.31am :
Ministers in the Afghan government must declare their property , Karzai says in his first hint of anti - corruption measures .
7.33am :
"" We will seek news ways of fighting this corruption , "" he says .
"" Drug trafficking is another problem we will fight it .
All those involved should be handed over to the justice system . ""
He also concedes that women 's human rights need to increase in Afghanistan .
7.37am :
While the BBC breaks off from live coverage , Reuters has picked out Karzai 's call for a Loya Jirga a national assembly meeting .
It quotes him saying this is necessary for peace and reconciliation .
7.40am :
Al - Jazeera is still covering the speech .
Its translator quotes Karzai talking about the importance of Afghanistan 's relations with its Islamic neighbours , particularly Iran and Pakistan .
But he also describes India as a "" good neighbour "" which has contributed aid to Afghanistan .
On Pakistan he says the presence of Zardari at the ceremony is sign of "" brotherhood "" between the two countries .
7.46am :
"" I consider myself the servant of all the people of Afghanistan , "" Karzai says .
He again calls on his rivals to join him rebuilding Afghanistan and thanks his guest and apologises for any "" shortcomings "" in hospitality .
Hillary Clinton smiles in the front row .
7.48am :
That 's it .
Karzai leaves the stage shaking hands with the VIPs on the front row .
There are smiles and polite applause .
7.51am :
Al - Jazeera reckons that Karzai 's words on reconciliation are code for talking to the Taliban .
Karzai 's dress underlined his call for national unity , according to new note from Julian in Kabul . ""
Karzai wearing traditional clothes from around country to symbolises unity – the cloak is Uzbeck .
It 's a bit like seeing Gordon Brown in a kilt and clogs . ""
7.57am :
Julian says the British view of the speech is that it "" hit all right policy notes in general terms , but the challenge is in the detail "" .
8.00am :
One of the anti - corruption measures outlined by Karzai was a national conference on the issue .
There was no sign of Karzai 's allegedly corrupt brother at the ceremony , Julian notes .
8.06am :
The top line being picked out from the speech is Karzai 's pledge to for Afghan security forces taking the lead in tackling the insurgency .
AP quotes him saying that Afghan forces should be able to take control of security in the country next five years .
Reuters says he wants Afghans to assume responsibility for unstable areas within three years .
"" Afghanistan wants to lead operations in non - secure areas in the next three years , "" it quotes him saying .
8.15am :
This picture has just emerged of a friendly greeting between Karzai and Zardari last night .
8.32am :
The LA Times reports on the disillusionment with Karzai in Afghanistan .
Mahmood Barakzai still remembers the rush of pride and optimism he felt when Karzai was sworn in for his first term as Afghanistan 's president .
This time around , the Kabul shopkeeper was n't even going to bother switching on the television . ""
Here in our country , everything has become more sad , more uncertain and more dangerous , "" Barakzai said , shaking his head as he wrapped his hands around a cup of hot sweet tea , trying to ward off a penetrating early - winter chill .
8.37am :
Here 's more on what Karzai said about corruption , according to AP .
"" We are trying our best to implement social , judicial and administrative reforms in our country .
Being a president is a heavy task and we will try our best to honestly fulfill this task in the future . ""
Karzai said that a conference would be held soon in Kabul to address ways to tackle corruption , and that his government would take its fight against drug trafficking seriously , prosecuting those who are linked to narcotics as well as those who are engaged in corruption .
"" Those who spread corruption should be tried and prosecuted , "" he said .
"" Corruption is a very dangerous enemy of the state . ""
The president insisted he would select "" expert ministers "" capable of providing competent leadership .
On national unity he said : "" I am the servant of all the people of Afghanistan , from every ethnicity , every tribe , from every place , from every province from every age , whether they are small children whether they are old people , women I invite all the presidential candidates to come and help in serving this nation . ""
9.03am :
Andrew Bacevich , a Vietnam veteran and Professor of International relations at Boston University whose son was killed in Iraq , says the US tactics in Afghanistan are exacerbating the threat of terrorism .
9.11am :
The US embassy in London has released a transcript of Clinton 's briefing to journalists en route to Kabul .
Asked about specific the anti - corruption measures , she discusses the commission mentioned in Karzai 's speech .
Well , we are asking that they follow through on much of what they have previously said , including putting together a credible anticorruption governmental entity – a commission , an agency , something that truly can deliver on the concerns that we and the people of Afghanistan have about corruption .
They 've done some work on that , but in our view , not nearly enough to demonstrate a seriousness of purpose to tackle corruption .
And it is going to be one of the principled requests that we make .
But it is reflective of what members of the government and others tell us they want to see happen as well .
9.19am :
Martin Patience , the BBC Kabul correspondent , says Karzai made the right noises .
He says the most significant part of the speech was call to for Afghan security forces to take over control in five years .
The US and other allies want Afghans to take the lead ( as do the Afghans . )
While the Afghan army is improving , some experts say it will need continued support for decades to come in areas where the insurgency is at its strongest .
9.29am :
That 's it for now , thanks for your comments .
There will be more updates on reaction to the speech on our Afghanistan page ."
2009-11-19,"Hamid Karzai has said he is determined that the Afghan army should be built up so it can take over responsibility from foreign troops for securing the entire country within five years .
Speaking after being sworn in for a second term as president , Karzai said he wanted Afghanistan 's security forces to be improved in "" quantitative and qualitative terms "" .
Currently only one of the 34 provinces , the capital , is controlled by the country 's own security forces .
Karzai said that by "" accelerating the training and equipping "" of the army and police , more provinces could be handed over .
"" It is only through this process that Afghanistan 's hope with regard to a quick return of our friends ' soldiers to their countries will be realised , "" he told a packed hall of Afghan and foreign dignitaries .
In another ambitious deadline , Karzai gave foreign and national private security companies two years notice before their activities are handed over to the Afghan security forces .
Although the private security industry is highly controversial in Afghanistan , the many private companies play a major role in securing everything from military compounds to embassies .
In general though , Karzai 's inauguration speech touched only on well - worn themes , including the long - held but never realised aspiration to turn Afghanistan into a "" transit corridor for goods and energy between north and south Asia "" , and to pursue peace talks with the Taliban , brokered by the Saudi royal family .
To that end he promised he would summon a loya jirga , a traditional gathering of the country 's tribes and power brokers , increasingly seen as a way for the Taliban to be drawn into a political process .
While Karzai called for Abdullah Abdullah , his main rival in the flawed presidential campaign , to "" come together to achieve the important task of national unity "" , he did not invite him to join his government , something the former foreign minister had rejected anyway .
On the thorny issue of rampant corruption , Karzai promised a new law obliging ministers and senior officials to declare their assets , in a bid to uncover whether modestly paid public servants possess serious wealth accumulated from bribes and the selling of positions .
Analysts pointed out that the legal requirement already exists , as does the High Office of Oversight , an anti - corruption body widely regarded as toothless , which Karzai said should be given more powers .
Nonetheless the Afghan president 's pledges were warmly welcomed by the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , who had flown into the country the previous night .
She said she was pleased by Karzai 's "" agenda for change "" , adding : "" The idea that government officials will have to register their assets , so that any money or other influence can be more easily tracked is a very bold proposal . ""
Privately western diplomats are not optimistic that Karzai will change his style of government ."
2009-11-20,
2009-11-20,"The fiasco of the elections in Afghanistan has been widely lamented .
Most laments focus on a single obvious fact : by winning a new term through fraud at the polls , President Hamid Karzai has weakened his legitimacy , endangered the already tepid support he enjoys in Washington DC , and handed the Taliban another piece of evidence , if one is needed , that his regime is corrupt .
How could this result have been prevented , or how might it be prevented in the future ?
A litany of answers has emerged .
Elections would be fairer if the countryside were more secure , if polling places were monitored by impartial observers , if votes were counted openly .
These answers miss a fundamental point .
American leaders pressed for this election because they believe that elections and democracy always go hand - in - hand .
Their formulation is painfully simple .
Countries that have competitive , multi - party elections are democratic ; those that do not are undemocratic .
No experience in recent times disproves this facile assumption more fully than the Afghan election .
By pushing Afghanistan toward competitive elections , the US has made it not more , but less democratic .
As the Afghan quagmire deepened , American leaders focused on the fact that Afghanistan has no strong central government .
From a Western perspective , this seems like an obvious flaw .
In Western countries , strong central power is a prerequisite for statehood .
Blinded to cultural and historical differences , Americans assumed that the same formula must apply to Afghanistan .
They set out to create a strong central government where none had ever existed .
For centuries Afghanistan was governed by a system in which clans , tribes and regions made most of their own decisions , and the regime in Kabul had little more than the power of moral suasion .
Under this system , Afghans enjoyed a deep and widely accepted form of democracy .
Decisions were made by local and regional councils – shuras and jirgas – that functioned by consensus , not majority rule .
Westerners accept competition as a fundamental part of life , in politics as in business .
This means there will always be losers .
Western cultures have largely assimilated the idea that it is acceptable to lose ; one can live with the result and hope to win sometime in the future .
Not all cultures believe this .
In some , losing is a devastating humiliation , even one that can justify a violent response .
That is why some countries developed decision - making systems based on consensus rather than win - or - lose competition .
Much trouble in today 's world has come from the desire to impose Western - style democracy on societies that had spent centuries developing systems better adapted to their own cultures .
In traditional Afghan society , the only way to become a decision - maker was to show wisdom and win the community 's trust .
Having a great deal of money or a private army was not enough to give someone a powerful voice in governing .
Under the electoral system that the US has imposed on Afghanistan , the opposite is true .
Elections there have given warlords , drug traffickers and other thugs a chance they did not have before .
No longer must an Afghan win the respect of his peers to be entrusted with decision - making power .
Guns , money , and a willingness to murder rivals are the new qualifications .
No system of government – electoral democracy , consensus rule , socialism , fascism – is intrinsically good or bad .
Nations choose political systems because they provide things that are intrinsically good , like security and prosperity .
In the West , electoral democracy provides those things , so it is reasonable that Westerners embrace it .
Elsewhere , however , electoral democracy has different results .
Afghanistan is a vivid example .
Blinded to cultural differences and wedded to the one - size - fits - all , "" world is flat "" concept , the West has pushed competitive elections onto Afghanistan .
Its assumption is : this system works for us , so it will work for everyone .
Elections , however , have helped rob Afghans of democracy .
A wiser policy for the US would be to accept Afghanistan 's weak - central - government tradition and try to revive the old decentralized , consensus - based system .
So much of that system has already been smashed , however , that rebuilding it is nearly impossible .
This is one of the tragedies of America 's misbegotten "" democracy promotion "" project ."
2009-11-23,"Afghanistan 's chief prosecutor has thrown down a gauntlet to Hamid Karzai by announcing an unprecedented attempt to prosecute for corruption two sitting cabinet members who can not be touched until the president strips them of their ministerial immunity .
Mohammad Ishaq Aloko , the attorney general , said he was preparing a case for the prosecution of two members of Karzai 's current cabinet as well as three former ministers , in what could become a key test of the Afghan president 's willingness to tackle corruption .
The two ministers have not been named , but speculation has focused on the minister of mines and the minister of religious affairs .
Fazel Ahmad Faqiryar , the deputy attorney general , said they had collected sufficient evidence to prosecute officials at the ministry but not the minister , Sadiq Chakar , although the investigation was continuing .
The officials allegedly overcharged for rented accommodation in Mecca to house Afghans during the annual hajj pilgrimage and pocketed the difference .
They were discovered on their return from Saudi Arabia with $ 360,000 ( £ 217,000 ) on them .
On Sunday , Chakar angrily denied local media reports that he was being investigated and said he was the victim of a plot to smear him .
Mohammad Ibrahim Adel , the minister of mines , refused to comment .
Afghanistan has vast , untapped mineral wealth and the ministry of mines is responsible for issuing large numbers of short - term excavation rights .
Irregularities have been alleged in the issuing of a $ 2.9bn contract to a Chinese conglomerate to exploit the Aynak copper reserve south of Kabul ‑
one of the world 's biggest copper stores .
The Washington Post recently reported allegations by US officials that Adel had taken a $ 30 m bribe from the Metallurgical Corporation of China to secure the deal .
He denied receiving any illicit payments .
The attorney general is looking at around 40 cases , with senior officials in the "" high single figures "" , an official said .
But under Afghan law ministers and governors can not be investigated and must be suspended from their duties .
"" It 's a great thing that the Afghans are finally publicising cases like this , but at the moment they have no power to bring these people in , "" said one western lawyer in Kabul .
Adding to the frustration of international anti - corruption officials , the country 's 2005 constitution calls for special courts to be set up to hear cases against various types of officials .
It is hoped that the supreme court will back the establishment of a specialised anti - corruption tribunal with secure facilities to protect the judges to hear all such cases .
But no site has yet been identified .
Much international effort has gone into improving Afghanistan 's law enforcement agencies , with British lawyers helping to mentor prosecutors in a special unit of the attorney general 's office focused on high- level corruption .
Also recently set up is the Serious Crimes Task Force ( SCTF ) , known as the "" Afghan FBI "" because the elite police operatives are trained by the FBI and Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) to use wiretaps and other sophisticated methods to collect evidence .
Nato has also set up an anti - corruption unit that will help gather intelligence which will be handed over to law enforcement bodies .
However , sceptics warn that such initiatives will only come to anything if they receive strong support from Karzai .
Some western law enforcement agencies believe that Karzai 's recently announced plans to beef up the powers of one of Afghanistan 's anti - graft bodies amount to little more than a "" public relations blitz "" to appease critics .
One US official pointed to a recent case where evidence amassed by the SCTF led to the arrest of a senior police official in the southern province of Kandahar , who can not be named until the case concludes .
The arrest of the officer , who has close ties to Ahmed Wali Karzai , the powerful half - brother of the president , caused intense embarrassment to Hanif Atmar , the interior minister , who was only alerted to the investigation after the arrest had been made .
The official said : "" The ministry of the interior deliberately prevented a search warrant from being executed because of spurious civil unrest fears .
"" They even refused to hold a press conference to announce what a great success they had . """
2009-11-28,"Afghanistan is to be set targets to tackle corruption and train more troops , to prepare for the withdrawal of British forces , Gordon Brown announced today .
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , will be asked to train another 50,000 troops over the next year and tackle corruption in the police and provincial government , the prime minister said .
Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Trinidad and Tobago , Brown said the targets – set by the international community and to be put to Karzai at a conference on the future of Afghanistan in London on January 28 – would enable control of the country to be handed over to its own authorities district by district , and allow international troops to leave . ""
Within three months , our benchmark is that the Afghan government should have identified additional troops to send to Helmand province for training , "" Brown said .
"" This is part of our idea that we will build up the Afghan army by nearly 50,000 over the next year . ""
Within six months , we will want a clear plan for police training that means corruption is being dealt with and we have a police force that works with the local community rather than sometimes against it . ""
Within nine months , President Karzai should have completed the process of appointing 400 provincial and district governors .
"" Some 5,000 additional Afghan troops should be sent to Helmand province to be trained by British forces stationed there , he said .
"" During 2010 , we must start the transition to an Afghan security lead in a number of districts and provinces .
I want the conference to consider the process for district - by - district handover .
"" I believe this can begin in 2010 in a number of districts , including one or two in Helmand itself .
We need to transfer at least five Afghan provinces to lead Afghan control by the end of 2010 . ""
The London conference will be chaired by the foreign secretary , David Miliband , and representatives of many of the 43 nations involved in the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan will attend .
Karzai will tell the conference which targets he has agreed to meet in return for continued international support .
A follow - up conference will be held in the Afghan capital , Kabul , a few months later to check progress .
Brown said he would announce next week whether the conditions had been met to send an additional 500 British troops to Afghanistan , building up the UK military presence in the country to 9,500 .
He said he was hopeful that an additional 5,000 troops would be offered by other Nato countries by the time of the conference , but declined to say which states might offer them .
The prime minister said no timetable had been set for the withdrawal of British troops and they would not leave until the Afghan army and police had shown themselves capable of maintaining security across the country .
"" There will come a point where we can transfer more and more districts and provinces to Afghan control . ""
It is at that point we would look at what was the need for British troops , if the Afghan people were able to take responsibility for their own security , but not before .
"" I have set no timetable and will set no timetable about troop numbers .
But we are setting milestones and benchmarks by which the progress of Afghanisation can be judged .
"" I hope we ( ... ) can look forward to a time in the future – for which there is no timetable at the moment – where Afghan forces can take responsibility and British forces can come home . ""
The UN secretary - general , Ban Ki - moon , who stood alongside Brown during his announcement , said the conferences in London and Kabul "" will outline the framework for an increased lead role for the Afghans in the shaping of their destiny "" , and re - shape relations between Afghanistan and the international community .
Brown said there would be no role for Taliban or former Taliban elements at the conference unless they renounced violence .
"" If there are people who wish to renounce the Taliban and renounce the violence and condemn the insurgency , then of course President Karzai has said he would welcome them back into the democratic process , "" he said ."
2009-11-30,"The US is seeking to extend its control over the day - to - day running of Afghanistan with the appointment of an international "" high representative "" in Kabul in an attempt to bypass Hamid Karzai 's much - criticised government .
The initiative , being pushed by the US special envoy , Richard Holbrooke , has caused a split between Washington and its closest Nato allies , who believe it could further undermine the Afghan president 's legitimacy and the United Nations ' role in the country .
The proposal is part of a political strategy designed to accompany the dispatch of US reinforcements due to be announced tomorrow night by Barack Obama and ultimately provide an exit strategy .
The political package under discussion includes the installation of an Afghan chief executive at Karzai 's shoulder in the government and closer international cooperation by a permanent "" contact group "" .
The measures are designed to overcome the weakness and corruption of the Afghan government that the troops will be fighting to support .
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , has said the government would fall within weeks if Nato pulled out now .
Some European officials , including senior British figures , argue that the gains in efficiency achieved by appointing an international envoy with vice regal authority would be outweighed by the Kabul government 's further loss of legitimacy .
"" This has to be Afghan - owned or it 's not going to work , "" a top European official said .
European states and Canada have a more positive view of the UN 's performance than the US .
Following his re - election in fraud - ridden elections , Karzai has promised his Nato backers he will a take a tougher line against corruption and has made greater efforts in supplying recruits for the Afghan army and police force whose training and deployment represent the core the exit strategy to be outlined by Obama .
Western governments are sceptical about whether Karzai will be able to reform as quickly as they would like to enable them to withdraw troops , and they are beginning to discuss contingency plans to improve Afghan governance by bypassing the president if necessary .
Foreign ministers from the countries with most troops involved – the US , Britain , Germany , France and Canada – discussed the next steps at Karzai 's inauguration on 19 November .
Holbrooke pursued the issue in visits to Berlin and Paris , and in conversations with British officials last month .
Final decisions will be taken at the London conference on Afghanistan in late January .
Holbrooke in particular believes the UN mission is ineffectual and soft on the Afghan government 's alarming record of corruption .
He is pushing for the appointment of a high representative for the international community , modelled in part on the post of the same name in Bosnia .
He has met resistance from European states and Canada that have more faith in the Norwegian head of the UN mission , Kai Eide .
"" This is something Holbrooke is pushing
but it 's not set in stone yet , "" said a senior defence official from a country with troops on the ground .
"" It is a way of getting around Kai Eide but some of the allies have a lot of time for Kai .
He has achieved a lot .
He persuaded Karzai to hire some of his better ministers .
He just goes about it in a quiet way . ""
A European diplomat portrayed the initiative as an attempt to restore US influence at the heart of the international co - ordination effort after Peter Galbraith , an American diplomat , was forced out of his job as the second - in - command at the UN mission in September because of a personality and policy clash with Eide . ""
In a way , the idea of this is to replace Galbraith , "" the diplomat said .
The Holbrooke - led campaign against Eide drew support last week from the International Crisis Group .
In a report on Afghanistan 's "" crisis of governance "" on Wednesday , the independent organisation recommended Eide 's resignation "" since he has lost the confidence of many on his staff and the necessary trust of many parts of the Afghan polity "" .
Eide 's term ends in March and some European countries have suggested he could be replaced then by a "" super - envoy "" , perhaps combining the UN post with a Nato civilian role .
The former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown was initially approached for such a job in early 2008 but his appointment was blocked by Karzai .
The appointment of Ashdown or another leading British figure in such a powerful role is still seen in Kabul and some capitals as problematic because of Britain 's imperial history .
Another name mentioned as a possible international high representative is the current US ambassador in Kabul , Karl Eikenberry , but he has recently clashed with the American Nato commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , over whether Washington should send more troops .
Nick Horne , a former UN official in Afghanistan who resigned at the end of October over the failure to achieve political reform , said the new international representative "" would have to be someone of international stature "" .
"" He has to have the full support of the international community , and the confidence of the Afghan people "" , Horne said ."
2009-12-01,"The UN 's top diplomat in Afghanistan today attacked proposals to install a powerful high representative in Kabul to deal with President Hamid Karzai , saying the idea flew in the face of the current strategy to strengthen the Afghan government .
Speaking hours before Barack Obama was due to announce his revised strategy in Afghanistan , Kai Eide said state institutions needed to be strengthened rather than "" bypassed "" by foreigners .
"" We should n't try to construct international solutions that will bypass the president or bypass the government on a phase when our basic approach is exactly the opposite , "" he said .
The head of the UN 's political mission also said he was "" not planning to resign "" despite speculation that he would quit his post after controversy over Afghanistan 's recent presidential election led several members of his staff to leave while others privately criticised their boss .
Eide said he believed he had the full support of the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , and the special envoy to the region , Richard Holbrooke . ""
At this critical juncture , it would be absolutely wrong to have any change in the major international positions in Afghanistan , "" he said .
Eide said he detected a "" new mood "" of optimism in Kabul and a move away from the "" doom and gloom "" of recent months , which have been marked by tension between Karzai and the international community over the fraud committed by his supporters in the August elections .
He said he hoped Obama 's new strategy announcement , the appointment of Karzai 's new cabinet in the coming days and a conference on Afghanistan next month in London would help "" give us the momentum that has been lost during the election process and is badly needed "" .
Rather than an exit strategy , Eide said the west was now working towards a "" transition strategy "" that would see more responsibility given to the government as institutions such as the army and the police were strengthened .
He also called for more to be done to boost the lowest level of government , saying Afghanistan 's district governors were paid a salary of just $ 60 ( £ 36 ) a month .
Today , however , it was clear that the US president would have a tough time convincing a largely sceptical public that his plan would work .
Malik Shahzada , a tribal elder from the Babaji area of Helmand province , said any increase in foreign troops would cause "" our problems to increase by the same amount"".""In the past 30 years , "" he said , "" all are problems have been because of the foreign troops .
In the past , we suffered a lot under the Russians and the same things happened today with Americans and foreign troops .
We are not happy with the current level of foreign troops .
Any increase will make things worse . ""
Stanley McChyrstal , the US general behind the plan calling for thousands of extra troops , is believed to want to allocate a substantial portion of the new forces to places in the south with large populations , particularly Kandahar city and its outlying districts .
The prospect of a big increase in foreign troops has raised alarm among some people who believe the large US presence will be seen as an unwanted foreign occupation in the heartlands of the Pashtuns , Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group .
But today , Eide said the risk of that would be reduced if troops followed McChrystal 's principles of "" getting closer to the people and placing greater emphasis on the avoidance of civilian causalities "" .
Some politicians closely associated with Karzai , however , say it would be a mistake to concentrate on major cities , where their presence will attract problems .
"" Sending troops to the cities will just increase the number of suicide attacks and civilian casualties in those areas , "" said Shukria Barakzai , a member of parliament .
"" We have a lot of problems on the border with the Taliban coming in from Pakistan , and the foreign troops should be sent to deal with them . ""
The additional forces will also help train up the country 's army and police , which are both expected to see rapid recruitment .
Haroun Mir , a political analyst in Kabul , said : "" We can not build a professional army overnight .
And if we rush to build them as quickly as possible , it will backfire .
Already the [ Afghan National Police ] is dysfunctional because people are recruited without being vetted properly .
We are probably going to need a decade to do this properly . ""
White House denies rift The White House has denied a split with the US ambassador to Afghanistan , Karl Eikenberry , who lobbied Barack Obama to hold back deploying more troops because the government in Kabul is too corrupt to support .
Eikenberry sent two classified cables to the White House last month challenging the strategy of the US commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , who was pressing for 40,000 more troops .
The ambassador argued that any additional deployment should be postponed until President Hamid Karzai demonstrates a serious commitment to ending graft and mismanagement .
But the White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , denied that Eikenberry will consider himself to have lost out .
"" I do n't think anybody participated in this process thinking , ' If I offer something in the situation room and it is not adopted , then somehow I 've lost ' , "" he said .

2009-12-02,"Gordon Brown said today said there was "" no question "" of British troops being withdrawn from Afghanistan until the Afghans could take over security control themselves .
He welcomed the pledge by Barack Obama to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and told the Commons that a "" very substantial "" number of the extra US troops would be going to Helmand to assist British forces in dealing with Taliban insurgents .
At prime minister 's question time Brown also disclosed that the Nato conference in London in January would discuss troop commitments by coalition partners , and Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , would give details of political reforms .
David Cameron , the Tory leader , warned Brown against giving "" false expectations "" or "" mixed messages "" over the date for the eventual withdrawal of British troops as he urged him to clarify reports on planned withdrawal .
Cameron pointed to Obama 's timetable for pulling out the first US troops by July 2011 and contrasted it to press reports over the weekend that suggested that Britain would start withdrawal by the end of 2010 .
The prime minister said he had already made the plans clear , and referred to an announcement on Monday in which he said that extra British troops would be sent to Afghanistan immediately to be "" more densely concentrated "" in certain areas .
They would then make the transition to "" partnering and mentoring "" roles alongside Afghan troops next year .
"" There is no question of us withdrawing our British troops until the point where we are sure Afghans can take over security control themselves , "" said Brown .
"" We will continue to have our troops until that point . ""
There are about 200,000 American , Afghan and coalition troops in the country now .
By the end of next year that will be nearer 300,000 , he said ."
2009-12-07,"The already dire plight of women in Afghanistan risks deteriorating further as the US and its allies take steps to turn around the war against the Taliban , according to a report by Human Rights Watch today .
Eight years after the Taliban were ousted from power , rapists are often protected from prosecution , women can still be arrested for running away from home , and girls have far less access to schools than boys , the report says .
With the insurgency strengthening in the south and making inroads into the north , the few gains made for women 's rights since the US - led invasion of 2001 could be further eroded if Hamid Karzai 's government and the international community push for peace talks with factions of the fundamentalist movement .
Among the examples of abuses against women collected by the organisation was the case of a woman who was gang raped by a group that included a powerful local militia commander .
Although she fought to have her rapists prosecuted , they were subsequently pardoned by Karzai .
Later , her husband was assassinated .
Rape was put on the statute books as a criminal offence this year but it is still not widely regarded by the police or the courts as a serious crime , with the attackers often receiving greater legal protection than the victims .
One survey found that 52 % of women had experience physical violence , while 17 % reported sexual violence .
"" Police and judges see violence against women as legitimate , so they do not prosecute cases , "" said Soraya Sobhrang , a commissioner at the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission .
Human Rights Watch said that more than half the women and girls in Afghan prisons were held for "" moral crimes "" , such as adultery or running away from home – although the latter is not a crime under Afghan or Islamic law . ""
Whether it is a high - profile woman under threat , a young woman who wants to escape a child marriage , or a victim of rape who wants to see the perpetrator punished , the response from the police or courts is often hostile , "" the group said .
Rachel Reid , of Human Rights Watch , said the situation "" could deteriorate "" .
She added : "" While the world focuses on the Obama administration 's new security strategy , it 's critical to make sure that women 's and girls ' rights do n't just get lip service while being pushed to the bottom of the list by the government and donors . ""
The report also warns that wives in half of all marriages are younger than 16 , and up to 80 % take place without consent .
A 13-year old girl said that after she escaped marriage she was pursued by her husband 's family .
Years later she still has not succeeded in getting a legal separation from her illegal marriage and women 's activists have been denounced in parliament for giving her shelter .
Campaigners have also been angered by the murders of high - profile women , including Sitara Achakzai , an activist and member of Kandahar 's provincial council , who was shot dead in April .
A female member of parliament , who can not be named , said : "" I 've had so many threats .
I report them sometimes , but the authorities tell me not to make enemies , to keep quiet .
But how can I stop talking about women 's rights and human rights ? ""
In August , Afghanistan quietly passed a law permitting Shia men to deny their wives food and sustenance if they refuse to obey their husbands ' sexual demands , despite international outrage following a report in the Guardian about an earlier version of the legislation , which Karzai had promised to review .
Although western and Afghan politicians like to hail the increase in school building since 2001 as a major success story , the Human Rights Watch report says the participation of girls remains very low , with just 11 % of secondary school - aged children in education .
Karzai , who was reappointed as president after a fraud - marred election regarded by most legal experts as unconstitutional , is due to announce his new cabinet in the coming days .
Human Rights Watch called on Karzai to release all women detained for running away from home and offer them compensation ."
2009-12-08,"The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , arrived in Afghanistan today saying he would put pressure on the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , to appoint honest ministers and telling reporters "" we are in this thing to win "" .
His visit to Afghanistan is the first by a senior member of the Barack Obama administration since the US president announced last week that he would deploy 30,000 more troops with the intention of beginning to bring them home in July 2011 .
Gates plans to meet Karzai and US troops in an effort to reassure both that the US is committed to winning the war despite its plans for a withdrawal date .
His visit comes as General Stanley McChrystal , the overall military commander in the country , prepares to attempt to convince a sceptical Congress that more troops are needed to fight a growing insurgency .
McChrystal 's appearance before the armed services committee kicks off the first of three days of congressional Afghanistan hearings expected to bring tough questions from both anti - war Democrats and conservative Republicans about Obama 's stated intention to begin paring down the US role in 2011 .
Gates and other administration officials have described the 2011 date as just the beginning , with the process of withdrawal likely take at least two or three years to complete .
The defence secretary said he believed the US mistakenly abandoned Afghanistan in 1989 as it fought the Soviets and understands Afghans ' concerns that they will be left alone against the Taliban .
He said he would try to assure Karzai and his advisers "" that we are not going to repeat the situation [ of ] 1989 "" and that "" we intend to be their partner for a long time to come "" .
As well as urging Karzai to appoint "" honest "" members to his cabinet , Gates said he would ask the Afghan president and the country 's defence minister , General Abdul Rahim Wardak , to step up efforts to recruit and train more Afghan soldiers and police officers .
McChrystal has set the goal of building the Afghan security force to 400,000 by 2013 .
There are around 94,000 Afghan police officers and 97,000 soldiers .
Gates 's trip came as the Pentagon issued deployment orders for more than 16,000 troops – the first major contingent of the 30,000 reinforcements expected to be in place by next autumn .
An infantry battalion of 1,500 Marines from Camp Lejeune will be among the first to arrive later this month , followed by another 6,200 Marines from the North Carolina base and 800 from Camp Pendleton , in California , who will be deployed next spring .
A 3,400-soldier brigade combat team from Fort Drum , New York , will also deploy in early spring .
Most of the troops will head towards southern Afghanistan , where anti - US fighters have a stronghold and fighting has been heaviest .
Obama 's plan envisages a surge of soldiers and Marines sent in to damp down violence before handing the mission over to the Afghans .
Gates said the US and Afghanistan were trying to address the problem of low recruitment and high attrition among Afghan forces by increasing pay and other incentives .
He said the biggest challenge was that , in many cases , Taliban fighters earned more money than Afghan police officers .
Gates also revealed that Washington was prepared to work more closely with Pakistan as soon as the government there expressed a willingness to do so .
"" The more they get attacked internally ... the more open they may be to additional help from us .
But we are prepared to expand that relationship at any pace they are prepared to accept , "" he said ."
2009-12-13,"Gordon Brown made a surprise visit to Afghanistan today to meet British troops and attempt to patch up his fractious relationship with the country 's president , Hamid Karzai .
The prime minister said the next few months would be "" critical "" and urged the Afghan government to take a bigger role in fighting the Taliban .
The visit included an overnight stay at Kandahar airfield , the coalition headquarters for the region , wherethe Brown stayed in a pre - fabricated , corrugated shed , surrounded by concrete blast walls .
There was a nearby concrete shelter for him to repair to in the event of a rocket attack on the camp .
It was the first time a British leader had stayed overnight in either Afghanistan or Iraq , and came at the start of a surprise pre - Christmas visit to the troops .
Brown said : "" I wanted to be here with the troops to thank them for what they are doing .
I wanted to see what it was like working with them . ""
In a joint press conference Brown and Karzai denied suggestions of a rift , claiming he and Karzai had always had "" the best relations "" .
Karzai said he was "" happy and honoured "" to call the prime minister a friend .
It was a "" very , very trustworthy relationship "" .
Brown has been prominent among world leaders in voicing criticism of Karzai 's government , following his August re - election in a vote marred by widespread fraud .
The Afghan leader hit back in an interview last week , saying comments from Brown were "" very unfortunate and very artificial .
It is extremely insulting "" .
Asked this morning about corruption in the Kabul administration , Brown said Karzai had drawn up plans that would include improving governance that he would present to the London conference on Aghanistan next month .
"" I do want to reassure families of those who are serving in Afghanistan and families mourning people lost in Afghanistan that the cause that we are fighting comes directly to the streets of Britain , "" Brown said .
Karzai said he was "" very , very sorry "" when he saw British troops killed or wounded in Afghanistan and said he was aware of the "" consequences "" in Britain .
Brown was briefed late last night and earlier this morning by senior military staff in Kandahar as well as meeting regular troops and inspecting new equipment .
Last week saw the 100th British soldier killed in Afghanistan this year , prompting further controversy and debate over Britain 's role in the country .
This year has been the bloodiest for British forces since the Falklands War in 1982 .
Brown said today he was "" more confident "" about the conflict following recent additions of equipment and the increases in troop numbers announced by himself and the US president , Barack Obama .
He paid tribute to the troops ' "" bravery , professionalism and dedication "" .
"" I know this has been a difficult year , "" he said , acknowledging that casualties have been "" high "" .
But he maintained that morale among the troops was good .
About 1,500 improvised explosive devices have been detected and dismantled in the past six months , the PM added , as efforts have been stepped up to counter the threat .
He went on : "" I think the next few months are obviously critical .
We need to show there is support for our forces back in Britain , which I know there is , and a determination to take on the Taliban . """
2009-12-13,"Big defence cuts are to be announced this week by the Ministry of Defence as part of an attempt to shift resources to the front line in Afghanistan .
News of the cuts came as Gordon Brown left Afghanistan after becoming the first British prime minister to stay overnight in a war zone since the second world war .
Brown slept in simple quarters at the Kandahar air base , the headquarters of Nato troops in the south of the country before meeting President Hamid Karzai .
It has become traditional for the British prime minister to visit UK troops in either Afghanistan or Iraq ahead of Christmas .
Brown 's talks with Karzai included discussions for a wide - ranging international conference on the future of Afghanistan in London on 28 January .
The cuts are expected to include the closure of some bases , cuts in civilian staff , and a commitment to improve procurement in line with a report commissioned by the government from Bernard Grey , a defence specialist .
It had been intended the cuts would have been announced in the pre - budget report last week , but the talks were not completed in time .
The cuts are designed to release extra cash for the troops in Afghanistan , including possibly new helicopter equipment .
The budget for the war is normally supplied by the Treasury from the contingency reserve .
But it is also understood that defence secretary Bob Ainsworth needs to find savings due to cost overruns simply to retain the MoD 's £ 38.7bn .
A previous attempt to find savings in the territorial army training floundered .
Ainsworth said : "" I 'm being asked to live within my budget and there will be tough decisions that will have to be taken in that regard .
I get additional money from the reserve in order to pay for the direct costs of operations
but I want to make shifts within the budget and there is cost growth within the budget .
I want to move money towards the Afghan operation , to see what more we can do to support our troops in current operations and that means that there may well be tough decisions to be taken elsewhere . ""
The pre - budget report last week disclosed that an extra £ 2.5bn would be given to the ministry of defence for 2010 - 11 to cover the cost of the war in Afghanistan .
It also revealed that Ainsworth is seeking to cut another 5,000 civilian staff by 2011 , taking total numbers down to 81,000 , a fall of 51,000 since 1997 .
A total of £ 14bn in the contingency reserve funding has been spent so far on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , including £ 5.2bn on equipment .
SNP defence spokesman said Angus Robertson said : "" Speculation of cuts and closures to vital bases and defence programmes is just contemptible when our forces are already overstretched and under - resourced , and while the UK government still insists on wasting billions on Trident nuclear weapons renewal .
Bernard Grey 's October report noted that in procurement alone , there was a £ 35bn gap between commitments and resources available to fulfil them .
However the cuts due to be announced shortly are not expected to cover the issue of procurement .
In a joint press conference with Karzai , the prime minister acknowledged that casualty numbers had been high and paid tribute to soldiers ' "" bravery , professionalism and dedication "" .
He said : "" I feel for all of those families who have lost loved ones , particularly as we move towards Christmas .
I know this has been a difficult year . ""
Brown said he felt more confident about the conflict following decisions by the US and Britain to send in more troops .
He insisted Afghanistan 's border regions "" are the location of choice for al - Qaida "" and "" the epicentre of global terrorism "" .
Both leaders denied suggestions of a rift between them , even though Karzai last week attacked Brown for suggesting Kabul was a byword for corruption .
Karzai offered to send 10,000 extra Afghan troops to be trained in Helmand and Kandahar , where most of the British forces were based .
There would also be 10,000 more Afghan police in Helmand and Kandahar , he said .
The London conference , Brown disclosed , will cover security and the conditions for a transfer to Afghan lead in districts and provinces ; improved governance at national and local levels ; building growth in the Afghan economy ; a route back for those who renounce violence and want to join normal politics ; a new framework for co - operation between Afghanistan and its neighbours ; and the reinforcement of international civilian work in Afghanistan ."
2009-12-15,"The embattled Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , embarked on a campaign today to convince the Afghan people and sceptical western allies that his new government is serious about cracking down on endemic official corruption , which opponents say is fuelling popular support for the Taliban insurgency .
Opening a three - day anti - corruption conference in Kabul , Karzai said he was well aware of the scale of the problem .
"" I know corruption exists in the government and elsewhere .
Let 's be realistic , "" he said .
Large - scale reforms were required to root out the sort of graft that enabled officials , "" after one or two years ' work for the government , to get rich and buy houses in Dubai . ""
Shortly before Karzai began speaking , a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the Heetal hotel , in the heavily guarded Wazir Akbar Khan district of Kabul , killing eight people and wounding more than 40 .
It was unclear whether the target was the hotel , frequented by westerners , or the nearby home of Ahmad Zia Massoud , a former vice - president and brother of the anti - Taliban guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud .
Karzai , who is struggling to re - establish his political legitimacy after the fraud - tainted presidential elections in August , indicated there were limits to how far he would go in tackling corruption .
The all - out crackdown urged on him by Gordon Brown and Barack Obama could lead to abuses , he warned .
"" As we fight corruption , we must be extremely careful that [ the fight ] does not become corrupt itself , "" Karzai said .
"" Every one of our police , every one of our soldiers ... can go to someone 's house , knock on the door and drag a man out of the house and terrorise him .
In my opinion , this is the main form of corruption . ""
Karzai highlighted last week 's conviction of Abdul Ahad Sayebi , his appointee as Kabul mayor , who was sentenced to jail on corruption charges – the highest ranking official to be prosecuted in recent times .
Sayebi is currently at liberty pending an appeal . ""
One very serious caution I want to say .
The mayor of Kabul has been sentenced to four years ' jail .
I know the mayor .
He is a clean person , "" Karzai said , suggesting his protege had been framed for refusing to hand out land development concessions .
Western pressure on Karzai is intense .
Last month Brown said he was "" not prepared to put the lives of British men and women in harm 's way for a government that does not stand up against corruption "" .
In his West Point Afghan strategy speech , Obama vowed there would be no more "" blank cheques "" .
In his presidential inauguration speech , Karzai appeared to promise a new beginning .
"" Those who spread corruption should be tried and prosecuted , "" he said .
"" Corruption is a very dangerous enemy of the state . ""
But his studied ambivalence today is likely to dismay western governments struggling to persuade critical domestic audiences that Karzai is a credible and trustworthy partner in the fight against the Taliban .
Another measure of his true intentions is expected in the next few days when the make - up of his new cabinet will be announced .
"" We are looking for a new cabinet that shows he [ Karzai ] has started to implement his inauguration speech , "" said a western diplomat in Kabul .
"" We 're looking at the top 10 key ministries .
We want clean , competent , professional people in there , especially the ones that get the money . ""
Diplomats say they expect senior figures in the previous administration , including allies of former warlords , to retain positions of power but to be kept away from the key spending ministries .
All the same , the prospective inclusion in the cabinet of associates of ex - militia chiefs such as Rashid Dostum and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf , and the continuation in power of Karzai 's two warlord vice - presidents , Mohammad Qasim Fahim and Karim Khalili , is likely to deepen political cynicism among Kabulis , western observers say .
"" Karzai is not serious about fighting corruption , and anyone who believes he is going to get rid of it is deluding himself , "" an Afghan analyst said ."
2009-12-15,"Eight people were killed in the Afghan capital , Kabul , when a suicide car bomber struck a hotel frequented by westerners , officials said today .
The mid - morning blast came as the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , was due to attend an anti - corruption conference elsewhere in the city .
The ministry of interior spokesman , Zemeri Bashary , said four men and four women died in the explosion .
"" It was a suicide attack , "" he said .
"" We are investigating .
We do n't know the target of the attack . ""
He said about 40 more people were wounded .
The car exploded near the Heetal hotel , in the Wazir Akbar Khan district , which is home to government officials , international organisations and diplomatic residences .
The blast was heard across the city at the foreign ministry , where about 200 people were gathered for the three - day conference on corruption in the Afghan government .
Speaking at the event , Karzai said the explosion had occurred near the home of his former first vice - president , Ahmed Zia Massoud .
The president said two of Massoud 's guards were among those killed .
The interior ministry said the target of the bombing was unclear , but sources said Massoud , brother of the anti - Taliban fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud , who was killed by al - Qaida two days before the 11 September attacks in 2001 , may have been the intended victim . ""
Of course we were the target , "" said Shah Asmat , an aide to the former vice - president .
"" Before , the Taliban killed Massoud ; now , they tried to kill his brother . ""
The hotel was only slightly damaged .
Three homes , including Massoud 's , were severely damaged and windows in buildings were shattered .
An Afghanistan intelligence official overseeing security for the hotel , who declined to be named , said he had been standing in front of the hotel when the car exploded .
He said he did not believe it was the target , as the car exploded approximately 30 metres from the entrance .
Hamayun Azizi , a 22-year - old English student at Kabul University who witnessed the blast , reported seeing a black four - wheel drive near the hotel .
"" It drove very slowly to the checkpoint , "" he said , "" and then it blew up . ""
Karzai later issued a statement condemning the attack and urging government officials to identify those responsible . ""
This terrorist attack , which killed and wounded innocent civilians , was an attack on humanity and Islam , "" the statement said .
In a separate incident , a US soldier was killed in an explosion in southern Afghanistan , Nato said in a statement .
It did not provide further details ."
2009-12-18,"Hamid Karzai has delayed announcing his new cabinet , expected this week .
Local media sources say Afghanistan 's president is being ground between two political millstones , caught in a predicament of his own making .
After all , he is believed to have offered ministerial posts to various political heavyweights in return for their support for his presidential campaign .
Those supporters now expect the president to fulfil his promise and put them in ministerial seats .
But Karzai 's hands are tied .
Washington is expecting him to come up with a clean , competent and capable cabinet .
The individuals who allegedly were offered ministerial posts were not chosen for these qualities .
So what is he to do ?
Please his internal supporters or his international critics ?
The former are bullies , the latter are paying the bills .
For now , the public is waiting ; the president is delaying ; and as always , there are rumours and speculation as to the outcome .
But what do Afghans expect of their new cabinet ?
The BBC 's Your Turn programme last week put this question to a diverse group of people in Afghanistan and abroad .
They all came up with a standard response , "" We expect our ministers to be honest , professional and patriotic "" , implying that the present cabinet is none of the three .
A similar view came to the fore in a recent parliamentary debate over the issue of dual nationality of some ministers .
Even though the constitution does not explicitly ban ministers from holding dual nationality , many Afghans view some ministers ' holding on to their foreign passports as problematic .
To put it bluntly , many Afghans believe that ministers who hold two passports are likely to flee the country as soon as there is a serious crisis .
Kabul 's famous "" surrender of the ties "" urban legend neatly summarises this view .
According to this story , during the June 2006 Kabul riots , a ministry official approached the minister and his entourage , telling them that their ties would identify them to the rioters as western lackeys .
The frightened technocrats quickly handed in their ties as they prepared to flee .
But the riots came under control , making an imminent departure unnecessary .
The resourceful tie collector , though , refused to return the ties and so became a hero in Afghan political folklore .
Whether a true tale or an urban legend , the story is illustrative of the gap that divides the cabinet from both parliament and the public .
The current cabinet is mainly composed of the bourgeoisie who left for the west in the 1980s , and so had no part in the jihad against the Red Army .
The people who stayed behind , those who fought or moved to Iran and Pakistan , refer to such Afghans by derogatory terms including "" dog washer "" or "" westoxicated "" .
The phrase "" dog washer "" is in reference to the fact that most Afghans living in the west are unskilled , working in the service sector , which in the vivid imagination of Afghans back home includes washing domestic pets of wealthy European or Americans .
The term "" westoxicated "" refers to those Afghans who return to the country with exaggerated western affectation .
This clash of cultures played out between a largely Islamist parliament and a westernised cabinet made up of the old bourgeoisie has been a recurrent source of political stalemate .
To be fair to the old bourgeoisie , the radicalised politics of the 1980s and 90s had no room for the moderate , nationalistic views of the westernised elite .
They left the country because they supported neither the communist regime in Kabul nor their nemesis , the mujahideen .
In the heat of 30 years of battle , the bourgeoisie was forgotten , representing as it did an irrelevant leftover of the past , too far away from home to merit consideration .
Their return to the country since 2001 has been as surprising as the rise of the Taliban five years earlier .
Yet the consequences of decades spent away from Afghanistan are plain for all to see .
The dual passport - holders are accused of lacking in loyalty to the country .
The public views them as arrogant and out of touch .
Their image of Afghanistan is equally believed to have been frozen in a distant , idealised version of the country they knew in the 1960s and 70s .
But if the cabinet is accused of lacking in common touch , its critics in parliament have their own , particular shortcomings .
Perhaps the tragedy of Afghanistan is that it is run by a cabinet that is alienated and a parliament that is largely composed of former warriors .
Neither of the two had a chance to learn the craft of politics under what would be deemed normal circumstances : in a sovereign and peaceful country they can call home .
Some critics argue that in our results - driven age , both the Afghan public and the international community are expecting too much , too soon .
Given that Afghanistan has emerged out of 30 years of turmoil , not to mention many more decades of under - development , the critics may well have a point and the president might well be right to take his time choosing his new cabinet ."
2010-01-03,"Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , was dealt a painful political blow yesterday when the country 's parliament rejected 70 % of his nominees for a new cabinet , including a regionally powerful warlord and the only female minister .
The secret ballot of MPs , which came at a crucial point in Karzai 's quest for legitimacy in the eyes of Afghans and the rest of the world , resulted in the rejection of 17 out of 24 of his nominees .
The most high - profile scalp was that of the water and power minister , Ismail Khan , a warlord in the western province of Herat during the 1990s civil war who is accused of corruption and human rights abuses .
Critics say he is an example of how the president remains beholden to regional powerbrokers .
"" I think , unfortunately , that the criteria were either ethnicity or bribery or money , "" MP Fawzia Kufi said of many of the names put forward by Karzai in the middle of December .
The rejection of the women 's affairs minister , Husn Bano Ghazanfar , was another awkward blow to Karzai , who has pledged to place more women in senior government posts .
The nominations were meant to keep 12 ministers in their posts for a second term and appeared , in part , to be aimed at satisfying US and western wishes that trusted hands be retained .
Karzai is believed to have hoped to put a new cabinet in place by the time an international conference on Afghanistan takes place in London on 28 January .
Of the seven nominees approved during yesterday 's voting by more than 200 MPs , all but one are currently cabinet ministers .
The Afghan president , who visited the southern province of Helmand yesterday to express his condolences to relatives of civilians allegedly killed in a Nato air strike on Wednesday , has pledged to make new nominations for the empty posts but it was unclear when those names will be announced , or when a parliamentary vote will be held .
The chief of Afghanistan 's elections commission said parliamentary elections will be held on 22 May , just 10 months after Karzai 's victory in a presidential vote marred by fraud and violence ."
2010-01-03,"The senior United Nations diplomat in Afghanistan today warned of yet more political uncertainty in the country after the country 's parliament rejected more than two - thirds of President Hamid Karzai 's long - awaited new government .
Kai Eide , the head of the UN mission , said the refusal by MPs to support 17 out of 24 proposed cabinet ministers would prolong the political paralysis which has gripped the country since the disputed presidential election in August .
"" Political energy will be spent in forming a new government and , as a result , energy will be taken away from what we really hope to spend our energy on in the coming months , "" he said .
With parliament about to go into a lengthy recess , Eide said it would be impossible for all cabinet ministers to be approved in time for a major international conference on Afghanistan to be held in London at the end of the month .
Afghanistan 's election commission today raised the prospect of a spring of political chaos by announcing that parliamentary elections should go ahead in May as required by the constitution .
Most diplomats believe the elections should be postponed because of the strong likelihood that they will be hit by the same level of fraud and insurgent violence that wrecked last summer 's presidential poll .
Despite the disruption to government , MPs said that their rejection of so many potential cabinet ministers was a victory in the battle against the ethnic powerbrokers and former civil war leaders seeking positions in Karzai 's government . ""
These people did not have the correct qualifications to be ministers , "" said Fauzia Kofi , a female MP .
"" The jihadi leaders and the tribal leaders thought that Afghanistan is still under the rule of 100 years ago , but this showed that the people of Afghanistan are ruling the country . ""
Mirwais Yaseni , the deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament and a former candidate in the presidential election , said the MPs wanted to "" get rid of warlords and appoint people who are capable and honest "" .
Most of the 17 cabinet ministers who failed to win enough votes from MPs were linked to ethnic powerbrokers and former civil war leaders who backed Karzai in his re - election bid last year .
Under a recently passed law , none of the rejected candidates may be resubmitted for the same job , and acting ministers must stand down after one month if they have not been endorsed by the parliament .
One of the country 's most powerful Tajik warlords from the western province of Herat was rejected for his old job of minister for energy and water .
Haroun Mir , an independent political analyst in Kabul , said that unless Karzai could find another way to reward his supporters he might risk seeing his political power base fray , and some even defect to his main political rival , Abdullah Abdullah .
Muhammad Mohaqiq , the leader of a party representing the Hazara ethnic group who strongly backed Karzai in the election , was among those who failed to get any of his candidates approved .
He said parliament was motivated only by "" the ethnicity and political party of the candidates …
These decisions show Afghanistan is going backwards to where it was eight years ago . ""
Karzai 's spokesman claimed that the vote by MPs would not affect the business of government as acting and deputy ministers would continue the day to day operations of their ministries .
It was a view echoed by some western diplomats who said most members of the bloated government did not play a critical role in the running of the country .
Many ministries have overlapping responsibilities , are poorly funded or serve little other function than to ensure all the country 's ethnic groups are represented at the highest level of government .
The US and its allies have instead concentrated on lobbying Karzai to appoint competent people to the most important cabinet posts , such as the defence , finance and interior ministries .
All the men nominated by Karzai for those ministries enjoy reputations among western diplomats for varying degrees of competence and were endorsed by parliament today .
Abdullah , the former presidential candidate now seen as the country 's pre - eminent opposition figure , said it was a "" step forward towards institutionalisation of democracy "" , but he also claimed that some of the seven successful cabinet ministers had won their endorsement by bribing MPs .
However Abdullah warned against holding a parliamentary election in May without further reform . ""
The nation can not survive another flawed election .
Without reform it wo n't mean anything and just create a much deeper crisis from which Afghanistan will not recover . """
2010-01-10,"Hamid Karzai has offered the main responsibility for fighting Afghanistan 's narcotics industry to a sacked former interior minister who was widely accused of corruption and incompetence during his time in government .
In a move which is likely to infuriate the British , who lobbied hard for his dismissal from his former job running the country 's police , Zarar Ahmed Moqbel has been named as one of 16 candidates for posts in Karzai 's next cabinet .
Members of Afghanistan 's lower house of parliament are due to interview Moqbel and the other nominees this week before voting on whether they should be given seats at the cabinet table , as Karzai rushes to form a government before he attends a conference in London on 28 January .
Karzai 's plans to appoint his cabinet earlier this month were unexpectedly derailed when parliament rejected 17 out of the 24 people he had nominated .
Among the main Nato allies in Afghanistan , the UK is the "" lead nation "" with special responsibility for helping the country tackle the multibillion - dollar opium industry that fuels much of the corruption plaguing the government .
Although the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development have gradually scaled back the amount of direct support , £ 2 m a year is still spent on foreign consultants who work in the interior ministry to train staff .
A British former law and order official who worked in Afghanistan during Moqbel 's time at the interior ministry said his nomination as the country 's top anti - drugs official was "" an absolute travesty "" . ""
Under his rule the [ ministry ] became a byword for corruption and incompetence , and the idea that Karzai now thinks it 's appropriate that he would take the lead at the ministry of counter - narcotics is just ridiculous , "" the former official said .
International pressure to sack Moqbel grew at the end of 2008 when it was belatedly realised that rampant corruption in the police was helping to drive Afghans into the hands of the Taliban .
During his tenure the ministry became infamous for selling senior police positions .
Provincial police chiefs would then make a return on their investments by extorting bribes from civilians and protecting narcotics and kidnap gangs .
Despite pressure from the US and the UK it took months for Karzai to dismiss Moqbel , who is supported by a powerful network in Parwan province .
He was eventually forced out in favour of technocrat Hanif Atmar .
Yesterday Moqbel spent the day at his home in Kabul talking to key advisers and experts on counter - narcotics in preparation for his confirmation hearing , which is likely to take place on Wednesday .
He denied the corruption allegations against him and defended his record in the interior ministry , saying he was responsible for persuading the US to start seriously investing in the country 's police force after years of neglect . ""
Fighting against drugs is not the problem of one or two days , it is a serious problem for the world and Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" But I believe that with strategy , planning and help from the international community we can do it . ""
Karzai 's new list does have some welcome candidates , said Thomas Ruttig of the Afghanistan Analysts Network , including the inclusion of three female candidates .
"" But this is the usual salami slice tactics Karzai likes to use , "" Ruttig added .
"" On the one hand he gives some positive developments like the three women and some of the others , but at the same time there are other nominees that pose serious concerns for the international community and most Afghans . """
2010-01-11,"Afghans feel more optimistic about the future , according to a survey published on Nato 's bloodiest day in Afghanistan for two months .
Against a backdrop of mounting violence , 70 % of the population believe their country is heading in the right direction , up from 40 % in 2009 , according to a poll for the BBC , ABC News and the German broadcaster , ARD .
Support for Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , has also increased from 52 % 12 months ago to 72 % now , despite a lack of trust in the disputed presidential ballot last August and his problems in appointing a cabinet .
The poll was published as Nato announced that six Nato troops , including three Americans and a French officer were killed in separate incidents , making it the deadliest day for the international force in more than two months .
The latest casualties come amid warnings that the bloodshed will increase as more foreign troops are deployed .
President Barack Obama is sending an additional 30,000 US soldiers , bringing the total US deployment to 98,000 .
General Stanley McChrystal , the top US commander in Afghanistan and the architect of the troop surge , said he believed the reinforcements were starting to turn the tide against the Taliban .
In an interview broadcast on ABC television today , McChrystal said he believed the troop surge had "" changed the way we operate in Afghanistan "" and was slowing the Taliban 's momentum .
But he conceded : "" It 's not a completed mission yet . ""
McChrystal said he was encouraged by a recent meeting he held in a former Taliban stronghold . ""
When I sit in an area that the Taliban controlled only seven months ago and now you meet with a shura [ a traditional meeting ] of elders and they describe with considerable optimism the future , you sense the tide is turning , "" he said .
His comments echoed remarks the head of the British army , General Sir David Richards , made yesterday .
Richards told the BBC that the mission would benefit from more soldiers , but this would be another "" tough year "" .
Last year was the most costly for UK forces since the Falklands war in 1982 , with 108 troops killed in Afghanistan .
Richards said he expected the level of British casualties to start decreasing by the end of this year .
"" I personally anticipate as we get this business of mass right
‑
the numbers of boots on the ground , a result of allied enhancements and a growth in the Afghan army and police ‑
that I would see a diminishing level of casualties from the end of this year , "" he told BBC Radio 5 Live .
Support for Nato troops is up slightly from 59 % in 2009 to 62 % now , according to the BBC poll of more than 1,500 Afghans .
Only 8 % of those polled thought attacks on foreign troops could be justified , compared with 25 % last year .
But the survey also uncovered serious concerns about corruption within the government and police , with 95 % of those questioned saying it was a problem in their area and 44 % saying things were worse than a year ago .
Only 39 % believed last year 's election was conducted honestly and 59 % thought the counting of votes was fraudulent .
The Taliban remain very unpopular : 69 % of Afghans think they pose the greatest danger to the country 's future ."
2010-01-16,"The Afghan parliament dealt a further blow to the authority of President Hamid Karzai by rejecting 10 of his 17 new cabinet nominees .
The vote today comes a fortnight after MPs turned down 70 % of Karzai 's first cabinet choices .
The 224 MPs did approve two key posts – Karzai 's former security adviser Zalmay Rasul was approved as foreign minister and Habibullah Ghalib as justice minister .
But only one of three female nominees was approved – Amina Afzali , as work and social affairs minister .
The two women proposed for the posts of public health and women 's affairs were rejected .
"" Unfortunately we have some lawmakers who still ca n't vote for a woman , even when they see one who is very active , talented and well - educated , "" said Mohammad Ali Sitigh , an MP from Day Kundi province .
Karzai 's choices for the ministries of higher education , commerce , transportation , public works , refugee and border and tribal affairs were also rejected .
The vote is likely to further worry the international community , which had hoped for a strong government to help keep disenchanted Afghans from siding with the Taliban .
The US and Britain have urged Karzai to get his second - term administration in place ahead of an international conference on Afghanistan to be held in London on 28 January .
Afghan MPs have complained that some of Karzai 's nominees lacked the credentials to serve in the cabinet , or were too closely aligned with the president or warlords . ""
The rejection of the majority of the list shows that the people of Afghanistan are not happy with the work of the government , "" said deputy parliamentary speaker Mirwais Yasini , an MP from Nangarhar province .
"" This will disrupt the work of the government and it 's not good for the future and the fate of the country . ""
Karzai 's office issued a brief statement saying he had chosen the nominees "" based on their talents , expertise and national participation "" and regretted that the outcome was negative ."
2010-01-16,"Hamid Karzai 's bid to appoint a cabinet before the international conference on Afghanistan in London later this month hit yet another hurdle when documents emerged suggesting that one of his would - be ministers lied about his age in order to be eligible for the post .
According to three documents seen by the Guardian , Jarullah Mansoory , the nominee for the minister of rural rehabilitation and development ( MRRD ) , is 31 years old – three years short of the constitutional requirement .
One document is a scan of Mansoory 's own passport , which says he was born on 1 July 1978 – a date confirmed by a copy of his national identity card .
A third document , an application for a course run by the International Atomic Energy Agency signed by Mansoory himself last summer , also has the same date of birth .
The documents have been held at the National Environmental Protection Agency , the body where Mansoory works as deputy director general .
Until mid-2009 he was chief of staff of the organisation , which attempts to preserve Afghanistan 's environment and natural resources .
Agency staff say the documents are all that remain with them after Mansoory recently removed his personal file from the organisation .
Foreign aid experts were shocked when Mansoory , a relatively inexperienced man , was put forward for the position of MRRD , saying the ministry required a more ­seasoned technocrat .
The lower house of parliament is due to vote on Mansoory tomorrow despite several MPs saying they are fully aware that he is too young for the post .
A previous list of 24 nominees saw 17 rejected earlier this month , further extending the political limbo which has afflicted Afghanistan since the summer .
Karzai is anxious to have a full cabinet in place before meeting his international supporters in London on 28 January .
Mansoory is himself a second - best choice after Wais Barmak was earlier rejected for the post .
Mohammad Naim Farahi , an MP from Farah province , said it was widely known around parliament that nominees had "" faked documents "" but that it was impossible to do anything about it .
Some Afghan MPs predicted Mansoory will receive enough votes because of the political patronage he enjoys from Mohammad Qasim Fahim , a powerful warlord and one of Karzai 's vice presidents .
Once a backwater , in the last year the ministry has been basking in the limelight from international donors increasingly looking for ways to kick start Afghanistan 's primarily agricultural economic base .
Yesterday the Guardian tried several times to contact Mansoory but was unable to talk to him ."
2010-01-18,"The daily business of government was already in full swing by the time a man wearing a white shalwar kameez walked towards the front gate of Afghanistan 's central bank .
Close by , deep inside his presidential palace , Hamid Karzai was finally getting round to swearing - in members of his new cabinet .
It was just before 10 o'clock in the morning .
The guards at the central bank were already on high alert after recent intelligence warnings suggested a spectacular attack was on the cards and the man in white was behaving extremely suspiciously . ""
He was about 10 metres away from the main gate of the bank and the guards told him to stop , "" said Ahmad , a plain clothes member of the elite counterterror group Task Force 24 , who was at the bank at the time .
"" But he did n't say anything or explain himself , he just carried on walking and tried to climb over the barrier . ""
Convinced they were being approached by a suicide bomber , the guards opened fire .
The man 's device detonated , causing a huge explosion that narrowly missed killing a group of British bodyguards , sheltered from the main force of the blast by another vehicle .
That was the first assault of the day .
efore
too long a fire , triggered by two bombers detonating their explosive vests , ripped through a nearby shopping centre , sending a plume of smoke high into the sky above central Kabul .
And minutes after the foiled central bank attack , explosions and gunfire could be heard from the nearby ministry of justice , on the other side of Pashtunistan Square , as the insurgents mounted another attack .
Either from there or from a nearby vantage point the attackers fired three rocket - propelled grenades into the ministry of finance , which hit reinforced shelters in its grounds where government security forces had taken cover .
After the first blast all that was left of the attacker , says Ahmad , were his two legs lying on the ground .
Attached to them were a pair of size 41 shoes
that in Ahmad 's view were clearly of a "" Pakistani "" design , hinting at the already widely held view among the country 's counter - terrorism chiefs that this was a plot that originated from outside Afghanistan 's borders .
Hanif Atmar , the softly spoken interior minister , added to that sentiment , saying : "" There is no school for training suicide bombers in this ­country "" – although there are plenty of radical madrasas that do so in the borderlands of Pakistan .
And , in his view , it was the quick-­wittedness of his security forces at the central bank that forced the team of insurgent gunmen and suicide bombers to leave and instead run amok in the nearby shopping centre , a far softer target .
"" Our officer who was killed , he was the one who detected the first suicide bomber trying to enter the bank , "" Atmar said .
"" He detected him and before [ the bomber ] was able to get to the front gate he was killed .
That detection forced the others to go and choose the shopping centre . ""
At a joint briefing with Afghanistan 's other security chiefs Atmar said the day also saw attacks on the former Bamiyan hotel , an explosion near a mosque and fighting in the Ariana cinema .
He said an intelligence agent was killed , two policemen , two civilians and a child .
He said 71 other people were wounded , including 35 civilians and that most of the injuries were caused by insurgents triggering hand grenades .
For the hundreds of civil servants and international consultants trapped in the government buildings there was little to do but listen to the five hours of explosions and raging gun battles and hope that their offices had not been penetrated by insurgents .
Security officials told them to lie on the floor and not look out of their windows .
Others did not have the advantage of such sensible advice .
Khalid Stanekzai , 23 , the boss of Afghanistan 's main Nokia dealership , stood at his office window high up in the recently built Gulbahar shopping centre .
He was captivated by the scene below him .
"" I had never seen the face of the war before , but I could see it all from there , "" he said .
"" I took my phone and got a picture because it was amazing to me .
I filmed it all on my mobile phone . ""
At around 11 o'clock , amid all the pandemonium , he noticed an ambulance approach his building .
On the ground the security forces were suspicious after the driver failed to respond to their challenges .
One of them was close enough to see that he had some sort of a detonation device strapped to his right leg , and yelled to his colleagues to dive for cover .
But Stanekzai did not hear the warning as the ambulance blew apart on the street below him , leaving behind a deep crater in the road .
"" The soldiers were running and they were shooting at the ambulance and then it made a very big explosion , "" – the last thing he remembered as shrapnel and glass tore into his face .
Meanwhile the police force was rapidly shutting down the city , sending thousands of people streaming away from the epicentre of violence as shopkeepers ­rapidly boarded up their houses .
In Shar - e - Naw , a considerable distance from the fighting , cars turned back on themselves into the one - way system .
People who tried to walk towards the fighting , including a few foreign photographers , had pistols waved angrily in their faces .
After it became clear that the attackers were using police uniforms , the Afghanistan National Army and the National Directorate of Security ordered the withdrawal of police from the centre of town and took over the counter - offensive , according to western officials .
They manned positions at the top of the ministry of finance from where they opened fire on the insurgents in the ministry of justice , across Pashtunistan Square .
It was only a matter of time before all the attackers were dead and the situation was brought back under control , leaving relatives to wait anxiously outside the city 's hospitals for the wounded , many complaining bitterly about the government 's failure to secure the capital .
By early evening Stanekzai was finally discharged from Kabul 's Italian - run emergency hospital with 52 stitches in his left cheek and six in his right hand where he had been clutching his mobile phone in front of him .
He left for home sitting bare - chested in the back of a friend 's car – the shalwar kameez that he had been wearing earlier reduced to a torn and crumpled mass of thickly bloodstained cloth ."
2010-01-19,"Afghanistan 's president will unveil a plan in the next eight days to offer work , education , pensions and land to Taliban fighters who lay down their weapons .
Hamid Karzai intends to launch the reconciliation and reintegration plan at the start of next week 's London conference on Afghanistan , although he is under pressure to announce the details earlier to help build international support .
The Afghan president has also pledged to hold a new peace conference , a loya jirga , in the spring , restating a standing invitation to insurgents ready to swear an oath to the country 's constitution .
David Miliband promised the initiative would have international backing .
"" We are looking for a lead from the Afghans about the sort of institutional mechanism they want to pursue , but I 'm also in close discussion with colleagues around the world about how we can make sure that there is a viable reintegration plan , "" the foreign secretary told the Guardian during a visit to Afghanistan to prepare for the conference .
Kabul has a longstanding policy of offering to help resettle Taliban followers who defect .
But the programme has been poorly funded and patchily implemented .
It has failed to persuade large numbers of fighters to lay down their arms .
Afghan officials say the Kabul government has learned from earlier mistakes and promise that the plan will be far more comprehensive , offering in some cases , a totally new life to the Taliban .
The initiative , which was presented to senior western diplomats in Abu Dhabi earlier this month , will include jobs or land to farm , education for young fighters and pensions for older insurgents who may have fought for much of the past three decades of conflict .
The package will also offer security against reprisals .
"" There 's evidence that a lot of the insurgents are tired of fighting and are prepared to do a deal .
They are fed up with the Arabs [ in al - Qaida ] , "" said one official with knowledge of the plan .
"" But the political signalling has to be clear and security has to be guaranteed .
"" The incentive package will focus on alienated communities rather individuals , rewarding clusters of villages whose sons return home from the fighting .
The idea is that such clusters will be strong enough to ensure their own security , and are less likely to return to the Taliban fold .
In unusual cases in which security was offered to Taliban commanders at odds with their own communities , they could be offered sponsored resettlement in another area .
There is some concern that overgenerosity may alienate Afghans who have not sided with the Taliban . ""
It is going to be a delicate balancing act between the tribes , "" an unnamed diplomat in Kabul said .
Lt Gen Sir Graeme Lamb , a former British special forces commander who leads the reconciliation programme for the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , has helped to design the structure of the reintegration programme .
But senior ISAF officers believe the initiative is being launched too early to benefit from the anticipated impact of the current surge in US troops in Afghanistan .
Western diplomats are also worried that the weak Afghan state , which is still unable to provide normal government services to most of its population , will prove incapable of handling such a complex task .
Asked at the weekend about the plan , Richard Holbrooke , the US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , said it would be different from previous efforts and added : "" It ca n't be any worse . ""
British officials and some other western diplomats want Karzai to announce the plan ahead of the London conference so that Afghanistan 's international backers would have time to digest it , before offering endorsements and funding .
But an Afghan spokesman said today that Karzai still intended to wait until the conference begins on 28 January ."
2010-01-19,"The Taliban 's spectacular attacks in Kabul yesterday took place just as the new cabinet members were taking their oath of office .
In a report posted online on the Taliban website , their spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid listed the ministries under attack : the ministry of mining , the ministry of justice , and the ministry of finance .
The Taliban 's message was clear : even though the ministers were taking charge of Hamid Karzai 's cabinet , the power in control of Kabul was not Karzai but the Taliban .
The ministers might not be used to the idea of dual governments , but outside Kabul Afghans have long learned to live under two parallel regimes , a daytime government run by President Karzai and a nighttime one run by the Taliban and other local strongmen .
Ministers living in Kabul had been spared this unsettling reality until now , hiding as they do in bullet - proof cars , on blocked roads and behind the protective walls of Kabul 's green zone .
But the reality outside the capital is otherwise and ordinary Afghans have learned to negotiate their daily routine around avoiding random violence by the Taliban and other troublemakers .
Monday 's attacks might have given the ministers a taste of what life is like for a majority of Afghans , especially those who live in restive regions .
After the attacks , Mujahid posted a report , written in broken English , on the Taliban 's al - Emarah website .
The report mentions the names of Taliban commanders who were in charge of the so - called martyrdom operations .
Mujahid says that seven of them "" gave their lives for Allah the Almighty , and embraced martyrdom "" .
Afghanistan is a curious place .
Those who kill are called martyrs .
Those who they kill are also called martyrs and the violence is apparently done for the sake of God .
"" God is everywhere in Kabul , "" said a friend who recently returned to the city .
"" It 's like a dictatorship .
There is no escaping God here . ""
Those who kill do so for the sake of God .
Those who die hope that God will punish those who kill .
Baharat , an Afghan woman who watched the violence on Monday from behind her office window told the BBC Farsi service : "" I saw terrified stallholders caught in the middle of the crossfire .
They did n't know whether to run for their lives , leaving the stalls unsupervised or to stay behind , and risk their lives . ""
The stallholders had two choices , to risk losing their livelihood or to risk losing their lives .
But in his report on the "" martyrdom operations "" , Mujahid made no mention of the terrified Kabulis caught in the crossfire .
His report reads as if Kabul were an empty space , a frontline inhabited only by government soldiers and their Taliban enemies .
There is no mention in the report of the children hiding in the cellar of the bank that came under attack .
The terrified stallholders or the shoppers stranded in Qari Aman shopping centre do not exist in the Taliban report .
The Taliban spokesman did mention the shopping centre , but only to claim that the blaze that burned down the building was the work of Afghan troops who had panicked , opening indiscriminate fire .
The spokesman then went on to mention that a "" brave mujahid "" by the name of Haji Massod had driven the explosives - filled ambulance to the Malik Azghar roundabout .
Again there was no mention of civilians .
The Taliban spokesman simply said that high - ranking officials and security personnel were killed in the "" martyrdom explosion "" , as if a busy roundabout in a city of three - and - a - half million people had been empty that morning .
Judging by Mujahed 's report , the Taliban are either in denial or regard Kabul 's civilians as fair game .
Either way , there 's nothing new about the Taliban attacking Kabul .
Their predecessors , who ironically also called themselves mujahids , began launching Sakar-20 rockets on Kabul in 1985 .
The people who fled the city and subsequently ended up in Pakistani refugee camps became known in the local language as Sakarbisti , the Sakar-20s .
Later , in the 1990s , Kabul turned into an open battleground under fire by various mujahideen factions "" martyring "" each other and the people of the city .
But Kabul is not the only city of violent acts creating new martyrs .
Afghanistan 's soil is full of martyr graves , triggering questions as to how to avoid unintentionally polluting a grave when doing one 's business outdoors .
In the villages , parents warn their children to tread carefully and avoid soiling what might be an unmarked grave of one of the country 's millions of martyrs .
But if the Taliban are in denial , so are the people of Kabul .
Hence , reports of Monday 's violence were soon followed by two sets of rumours .
The first rumour insinuated that the attacks were orchestrated by Karzai 's administration with the purpose of distracting public attention from the president 's failure to come up with an adequate cabinet .
The second rumour also held Karzai responsible by implying that by allowing the Taliban to carry out the attacks in the heart of the city , the president was trying to persuade the public that the Taliban simply had to be given government posts or else they would destroy Kabul .
Such rumours made the rounds even though the Taliban had not only claimed responsibility for the attacks , but also were making a point of describing their operations in detail and mentioning the commanders in charge of the attacks by their name .
Needless to say , the commanders were either Mullah such - and - such or Hajji such - and - such – titles that indicate religious credentials .
Afghans are so used to violence and its justification that they rarely realise just how absurd their situation is .
Hence when a fellow journalist recently asked the family of a victim of the Taliban 's violence , he was given an ambivalent answer : "" May God punish the enemies of Islam . ""
The language of theology has become intertwined with the discourse of violence and the result is bewildering , with murderers and victims called martyrs alike ."
2010-01-26,"Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , is under intense western pressure to take more serious action against corruption at the start of a critical conference in London about his country 's future .
Donor nations rejected an anti-­corruption plan presented by Karzai 's government last week as half - hearted , and asked him to come up with more ambitious measures for the Lancaster House conference , where his leadership will be seen as central in determining whether the war with the Taliban is winnable .
The extent of doubts over his qualities became clear with the publication of classified memos sent by the US ambassador in Kabul , Karl Eikenberry , to Washington in November .
In the diplomatic cables , published by the New York Times , he said Karzai "" is not an adequate strategic partner "" and "" continues to shun responsibility for any sovereign burden "" .
"" Sending additional forces will delay the day when Afghans will take over , and make it difficult , if not impossible , to bring our people home on a reasonable time­table , "" Eikenberry wrote on 6 November . ""
An increased US and foreign role in security and governance will increase Afghan dependence , at least in the short term .
"" The depth of these reservations will inevitably damage attempts by more than 70 state delegations to demonstrate international resolve and unity .
Nato announced a radical overhaul of its own Afghan operations , naming Mark Sedwill , Britain 's ambassador in Kabul , as its civilian representative .
Sedwill 's enhanced role will give him the power to co - ordinate most of the reconstruction and development work across Afghanistan .
Sedwill , 45 , will be one of the most powerful figures in Kabul , and at the centre of an often uneasy relationship between Nato and Karzai .
Since Karzai 's difficult re - election last year , troop - contributing and donor countries have put the president under pressure to reform his graft - riddled government , and the president pledged to take on corruption in an address in November .
However , the plan presented last Wednesday to a panel of donor countries and Nato ­powers , the joint co - ordination and monitoring board , was a watered - down version of what he promised , diplomats said .
It did not allow for a permanent independent commission to monitor corruption but only an ad hoc body summoned in extraordinary circumstances .
Reformers led by the finance minister , Omar Zakhilwal , were reported to be trying to strengthen the anti - corruption measures in the face of fierce resistance from other cabinet members .
Some Afghan officials are said to resist even the word "" reform "" in documents to the conference , as it implies the Karzai government is less than perfect .
"" That is the weak part of the whole process .
It 's not clear what Karzai will bring to ­London , "" said a European diplomat involved in the London talks .
"" A lot will depend on how consistent we [ the west ] are in pushing him .
At the moment , we have no real means of putting pressure on . ""
Another significant unknown is how far Karzai will go with his opening address in offering peace terms to the Taliban .
An international fund ( with mostly Japanese , British and American money ) will be set up to help finance reintegration of Taliban footsoldiers but Karzai may also address the Taliban leadership in his remarks .
He has offered to hold a peace council , a loya jirga , before the next international conference , due in Kabul this spring .
Late last night , the security council said it was removing five former senior Taliban officials from its sanctions list .
All five were high - ranking members of the former Taliban government .
Four were listed as former foreign minister Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil , former deputy minister of commerce Fazal Mohammad , former Taliban press officer Shams - us - Safa Aminzai and former deputy minister of planning Muhammad Musa Hottak .
It said the fifth , former deputy minister of frontier affairs Abdul Hakim , had renounced the Taliban three years ago and was now a governor of Uruzgan province .
All five were put on the UN blacklist in 2001 .
Diplomats say Russia has traditionally been reluctant to remove any rehabilitated Taliban from the sanctions list , but US and other other western diplomats have been lobbying them to permit de - listings as an incentive for persuading insurgents to support Karzai 's government .
A meeting of Afghanistan 's neighbours in Istanbul offered a broad endorsement of Karzai 's reconciliation and reintegration effort .
"" More than lip service was paid to the importance of regional co - operation to Afghan stability today , "" said David Miliband , who attended the Istanbul meeting .
The ­foreign secretary claimed the attitude of Pakistan , which has a long history of ties to the Taliban , had been particularly positive .
"" I think the government is in a completely different position than when I first went to Pakistan three years ago .
We 've moved from a finger - pointing blame game towards security co - operation . ""
The London conference will also address dissatisfaction with international backers , who have yet to harmonise efforts .
Different nations run the military - civil "" provincial reconstruction teams "" , or PRTs , in different provinces , with considerable duplication and wasted resources .
In his Nato role , Sedwill will co - ordinate the teams , which spend the lion 's share of reconstruction funds , but he will not have total control over those funds .
That is jealously guarded by donor governments .
A group of eight aid agencies will criticise the PRT system : "" The militarisation of aid is putting ordinary people on the frontlines of the conflict .
Afghans say that the military places them at greater risk when they build schools and ­clinics which then become targets of armed opposition groups . ""
A study by Oxfam , called Quick Impact , Quick Collapse : the Dangers of Militarised Aid in Afghanistan , notes : "" While it costs approximately $ 1 m a year to support the deployment of one US soldier in Afghanistan , an average of just $ 93 in development aid has been spent per Afghan per year over the past seven years . ""
Far too much aid has focused on ' quick fixes ' and Band - Aid approaches rather than on what will produce positive and lasting results for Afghans over the long term , "" Aged 45 , he has risen speedily through the diplomatic ranks since joining the Foreign Office in 1989 .
He spent time in Egypt and Iraq , where he was first secretary and a UN weapons inspector from 1996 - 97 .
He was a private secretary to two foreign secretaries , Robin Cook and Jack Straw , and Britain 's spokesman on the Middle East in 2002 .
the report added ."
2010-01-27,"Nato 's new top civilian representative in Afghanistan has warned that a lasting peace will require talking to some "" pretty unsavoury characters "" with appalling human rights records , and bringing them within the Afghan political system .
Mark Sedwill , who was – until yesterday –
Britain 's ambassador to Kabul , was speaking before tomorrow 's London conference , at which much of the focus will be on the signals President Hamid Karzai sends to the Taliban in his opening remarks .
The Afghan leader is expected to deal principally with a plan to reintegrate Taliban footsoldiers through internationally funded development projects , but Karzai 's speech will also be keenly watched for any peace overtures towards the leadership of the insurgency .
British and US officials say any serious talk of reconciliation with Taliban leaders is premature but Sedwill said that ultimately such "" hard choices "" have to be made .
"" If we are going to bring conflicts like Afghanistan to an end
… that means some pretty unsavoury characters are going to have to be brought within the system , "" Sedwill said , at London 's Frontline Club . ""
Because if you do n't bring them within the system in some way
… you risk whatever fragile peace you build falling apart . ""
Sedwill , named yesterday as Nato 's special civilian representative in Kabul , said refusing to deal with Taliban leaders because of their past would be hypocritical when there were warlords responsible for "" appalling abuses "" in the government camp .
It is just worth remembering that when we talk about reconciliation with the Taliban .
We have got to be careful not to be making hypocritical moral judgements and saying one group are absolutely beyond the pale because of the way they conducted themselves while another group of people are in the tent despite the way they conducted themselves . ""
Speaking to the Guardian on the eve of the conference , Shah Mahmood Qureshi , Pakistan 's foreign minister , said Pakistan was uniquely placed to help talks between the western alliance and the Taliban . ""
Pakistan is perhaps better placed than any other country in the world to support Afghan reintegration and reconciliation .
Why ?
We speak the same language , we have common tribes , a common religion , we have a commonality of history , culture and tradition , "" he said .
"" But it [ Pakistani mediation ] depends on whether we are asked to do so .
If asked , the government of Pakistan would be happy to facilitate . ""
Yesterday , in what was widely seen as an attempt to raise the incentives for defection or peace negotiations , and on President Karzai 's request , the UN removed the names of five former Taliban officials who have left the insurgency from a sanctions list that subjected them to travel bans and the freezing of their assets .
The US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , welcomed the move yesterday , calling it "" a long overdue step "" . ""
That list … should be re - examined and scrubbed down .
There are people on it who are dead .
There are people on it who should n't be on it , "" Holbrooke said .
The prospect of a deal being made with Taliban commanders has alarmed Afghan human rights groups and women 's organisations , who are concerned that the gains since the fall of Taliban could be negotiated away behind closed doors .
Shinkai Karokhail , a woman MP from Kabul , said yesterday : "" We really fear that this could happen in secret dialogue or contacts .
We have met President Karzai and he has verbally promised us that those who do not respect the constitution will not be part of our government .
Still , we want an international guarantee the government will not make these deals in secret . ""
Holbrooke said women 's rights would be one of the international community 's "" red lines "" in any future peace negotiations with the Taliban .
He also played down the prospect of imminent talks with the Taliban leadership , saying the focus of the Lancaster House conference would be the Taliban rank and file who , Holbrooke argued , were mostly not driven by the ideology of Taliban or al - Qaida leaders ."
2010-01-28,"British troops could remain in Afghanistan for another 15 years , the country 's president Hamid Karzai said today .
In a BBC interview before the start of the London conference on the future of Afghanistan , Karzai said that although Afghan police and soldiers could be trained and equipped within five to 10 years , "" sustaining "" them would take longer .
Gordon Brown said that the number of troops and police officers would rise to 300,000 by 2011 , and the number of British troops in the country could be gradually reduced .
But Karzai said : "" With regard to training and equipping the Afghan security forces , five to 10 years would be sufficient .
With regard to sustaining them … the time period extends to 10 to 15 years .
"" Brown and Karzai were speaking in a joint interview with the BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , broadcast before they both made opening speeches at the start of the conference in Lancaster House , London , this morning .
Brown would not be drawn on a timetable , and said instead that British withdrawal depended on conditions in the country .
He said : "" I 'm not giving a timescale ; what I 'm saying is , if the conditions are met , that security can be taken over by the Afghans in the provinces in which we operate , then British forces will not be needed at the level they are at the moment . ""
Karzai told the BBC that the leaders expect to emerge from the conference with a "" clear agenda "" for the next five years , and said Afghanistan would try its best to meet its end of the security bargain .
He said : "" We will try our best to deliver .
There are expectations in Afghanistan too .
The Afghan people want a better future , a more secure future .
"" It 's absolutely in the best interests of Afghanistan that we train an adequate number of troops and train them properly and Afghanistan must provide the men which we will do . ""
Brown said that , as well as strengthening Afghan security , non - violent elements of the Taliban would be persuaded to take part in the "" democratic process "" .
He said : "" We are looking at a group of people who are easily divided because most of them have got different reasons for being part of this insurgency .
Some are ideologically committed and support al - Qaida and they have got to be driven out and dealt with . ""
But he said the rest included factions such as mercenaries who may be persuaded to back the country 's government and renounce violence .
The prime minister also stressed that Britain 's presence in the country is necessary to protect the UK from terrorist plotters .
He said : "" Three - quarters of the terrorist plots until now that we have had to deal with do n't emanate from London or Europe or any other part of the world , they emanate from the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
"" It 's about the safety and security of our citizens , and 43 nations are involved in this because they are worried also .
"" Those invited to take part in the conference include foreign ministers from the countries making up the Nato mission , and from Afghanistan 's immediate neighbours and key regional players .
Iran was invited but announced yesterday that it would not attend , although Downing Street said it remained hopeful a representative of its London embassy would take part .
There will also be representatives from Nato itself , the United Nations , the European Union and other international organisations such as the World Bank .
America will be represented by Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , who last night joined a smaller international summit in London to discuss the security threat from extremists in Yemen ."
2010-01-28,"The revelation that the UN had held exploratory peace talks with Taliban commanders three weeks ago raised new hopes of a negotiated settlement to Afghanistan 's gruelling insurgency .
The news came at the end of a conference in London at which the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , sketched out a peace process with the full backing of the west . ""
The solution to a war is always to talk to your enemies , unless one party triumphs , "" the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said .
"" That is not the case here . ""
Days earlier , the Nato commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , also signalled his belief that four years of hard combat with the Taliban would ultimately be ended by a political deal .
"" As a soldier , my personal feeling is that there 's been enough fighting , "" he told the Financial Times .
The sentiment was ­echoed last night by the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton .
However , obstacles remain .
The Afghan government and its western backers still retain "" red lines "" they say are non - negotiable : severing of ties with al - Qaida , and acceptance of basic human rights , including women 's rights .
Opening the conference , President Karzai said : "" We must reach out to all of our countrymen , especially our disenchanted brothers who are not part of al - Qaida or other terrorist networks , who accept the Afghan constitution . ""
Those conditions are likely to be too much for the head of the Taliban 's Quetta Shura leadership council , Mullah Omar , who is widely seen as "" irreconcilable "" .
The longstanding goal of Nato strategy in Afghanistan has been to peel away any of his lieutenants who are thought to oppose his pact with Osama bin Laden , and believe the Taliban has paid too high a price for it .
The fact that some Taliban regional commanders sought out Kai Eide , the UN 's special representative in Afghanistan , to sound him out on guarantees of safety if they laid down their arms , raises hopes in the Nato camp that its plan to demoralise the Taliban with nearly 40,000 reinforcements and a show of unity , could be paying dividends .
The optimism was hedged with caution .
Nato 's generals in Afghanistan believe most Taliban still believe they are going to win .
"" Our surge has not had yet had an impact on them , "" a senior Nato officer said .
"" They are still absolutely confident . ""
Most western officials argue that genuine peace talks with the Taliban will only be feasible once the movement has been weakened by the Nato military surge and by reintegration efforts aimed at luring insurgents away with jobs and community development projects .
However , Eide told journalists that lower - level reintegration and ­reconciliation talks with the Taliban leadership should take place in tandem . ""
The reintegration process is important , but it has to be accompanied by political reconciliation "" the UN envoy said at the end of the London conference .
He pointedly referred to detainees in US - run detention centres at Bagram airport , outside Kabul , whose cases he said had to re - examined . ""
That means going through the list of detainees ... to take out people who need not be there , "" he said .
According to an account by Reuters news agency of the meeting held in Dubai in January , the Taliban delegates had specifically raised their fears of "" disappearing "" into CIA - run "" black sites "" at Bagram .
The Karzai peace plan , unveiled for delegates from more than 60 countries at today 's conference , involves creating a national peace council , to oversee the reintegration of the Taliban rank and file , some 75 % of whom are thought to fight within a few miles of their village , for principally local reasons .
For their commanders , Karzai offered the prospect of reconciliation , a process which would be brokered with the help of the Saudi monarchy .
As a first step , a grand peace council , or Loya Jirga , would be convened "" in the next few weeks "" , the foreign minister , Rangeen Dadfar Spanta , said .
It would be open to tribal elders from across the country , including those tribes that took no part in the 2001 Bonn peace conference because of their links with the Taliban .
They were thus excluded from the post - Taliban Afghan state – a decision European and US officials now concede was a serious mistake .
In what was seen as a "" sweetener "" for a future peace deal , Karzai asked the UN to remove from a sanctions list the names of five former Taliban officials who had left the movement .
Asked about his government 's role as a peace broker , Prince Saud al - Faisal , the Saudi foreign minister , said his country would only talk to the Taliban only if they severed ties with al - Qaida and Osama bin Laden . ""
Saudi Arabi has no connection with the Taliban , "" he said .
"" We cut connections ages ago , when they started to give sanctuary to Bin Laden , and we have n't renewed them . """
2010-01-28,"No international conference on Afghanistan would be complete without the leak of a memo to undermine it .
The damage was done to today 's conference in London by the publication of diplomatic cables from the US ambassador in Kabul .
The star guest of today 's conference , President Hamid Karzai , the man on whom too much of Washington 's strategy rests , is , in Karl Eikenberry 's words , an inadequate strategic partner who continues to shun responsibility for any sovereign burden .
The cables were written in November and pre - date President Barack Obama 's announcement of a surge .
Since then , their author professed his unequivocal support for the mission before Congress .
But that is not what his cables say .
In arguing that more troops would only increase Afghan dependence and may delay the day when US troops can be withdrawn , they undermine the whole rationale of the surge .
The leaking of the cables just before this conference goes beyond the realm of healthy debate .
It can only attest to abiding divisions within the US administration itself .
So another conference starts –
this is at least the sixth in nine years – with private doubts about strategy being expressed by the very people whose job is to promote it .
As we all knew he would and despite speeches to the contrary , Mr Karzai has doggedly resisted attempts to reform his graft - riddled government .
He comes to London with only half a cabinet in place , but having reaffirmed the appointment of General Abdul Rashid Dostum as his chief of staff , a man accused of serious human rights abuses .
Zarar Ahmad Moqbel , the man who oversaw the most corrupt organisation in the government , the interior ministry , has gone up in the world .
He is now in charge of combating the opium industry , the world 's largest .
It may be truer to say that he is now in charge of the opium industry .
Two of the shadiest ex‑warlords , Mohammad Qasim Fahim and Karim Khalili , are vice-­presidents .
Thus far Mr Eikenberry 's predictions about the behaviour of the Afghan president , after an election which was internationally discredited , have held true .
Mr Karzai 's real interest is in rewarding supporters and keeping the warlords onside .
Having recognised his dodgy re - election , Mr Karzai 's international backers have once again no real levers to pull against the Afghan president .
This has a bearing on the second plank of the London conference , an attempt to engineer new talks with the Taliban .
The stage has been set for this by the removal of five former senior Taliban officials from a UN sanctions list , and Mr Karzai may attempt to steal the show by announcing a Loya Jirga , or an assembly of elders , to discuss talking to the Taliban .
Without Mr Karzai in place , and without a surge , this may have had a chance of success , even though it would require enough senior Taliban to recognise that they too can not win militarily , and there is scant evidence of that .
With Mr Karzai in place the prospects of a breakthrough are slimmer still .
In December 2007 he expelled a western official for trying just that .
Michael Semple has written extensively about the value of negotiating with Taliban .
Mr Semple believes a Belfast - style power - sharing agreement with the Taliban remains the only viable way out of a conflict that can not be won militarily .
While the war rages , he argues , it becomes a cover for serial breaches of human rights on both sides , and removes accountability both by the ­government and the Taliban .
This is not the current model of reconciliation , which would be a means of splitting the footsoldiers from its leadership .
Taliban ­commanders will not break with the person they regard as the symbol of resistance , their leader Mullah Omar .
Real negotiations would not be an attempt to win the war by other means but a move away from it .
The problem with the surge is that , far from persuading the Taliban that they can not win , it gives them every ­incentive to fight on ."
2010-02-22,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has unilaterally taken control of the country 's top electoral watchdog , provoking outrage from western diplomats , the Guardian has learnt .
The Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) , which forced Karzai into a runoff election after it disqualified nearly 1 m fraudulent votes in last year 's presidential election , previously included three foreign experts named by the UN .
However , according to a new presidential decree published today , Karzai will have the exclusive power to appoint all five panel members .
His decision to "" Afghanise "" the ECC came while parliament was in recess .
It provoked a shocked reaction from western diplomats , who fear parliamentary elections – due to take place in six months – will be fatally undermined by a repeat of last year 's electoral fraud .
Such an outcome would not only destroy the credibility of parliament , it would also be a further distraction to international efforts to push back the Taliban and build popular confidence in the Afghan government .
One foreign election expert described the decree as a "" stunning "" development .
A western diplomat said Karzai had given "" two fingers "" to the western donors who had pumped millions of dollars into establishing democratic elections in the country .
He said the Afghan president was using his power to make laws while parliament was not sitting in order to get rid of the three UN - appointed foreigners who had dominated the five - member ECC .
The commission 's Canadian chairman and his two non - Afghan colleagues were instrumental in demanding an investigation into widespread fraud during the election last summer .
Karzai was stripped of 954,526 votes and forced to accept a second round of voting after the ECC 's intervention left him short of the majority he needed to win outright .
Karzai has never accepted either the ECC 's verdict or that there was widespread fraud , instead blaming foreigners for "" defaming "" the process .
Abdullah Abdullah , the runner - up in the presidential election , said the presence of foreign commissioners last year was the only thing that prevented the country falling into "" absolute turmoil "" .
He told the Guardian : "" It is a step backwards and it has to be challenged by parliament and the international community . ""
If we are left with this situation as it is today , it could seriously jeopardise the efforts being made on the military front.""The election decree also does nothing to address foreign concerns about the Independent Election Commission , the Afghan organisation charged with running the vote .
Western diplomats threatened to withdraw funding if the commission was not overhauled and the chairman – heavily criticised for being biased towards Karzai – replaced .
Karzai has made no secret of his desire to "" Afghanise "" the membership of the ECC , but most diplomats thought he would be unable to do so because the constitution says election law can not be changed within a year of a national vote .
However , the palace argues the constitution only prevents parliament from changing electoral law while presidential decrees are not so constrained .
By the same logic , Karzai 's aides argue that parliament would be unable to use its power to challenge the decree within 30 days of returning to work .
Diplomatic sources say Kai Eide , the head of the UN in Afghanistan , had struck a private deal with Karzai under which he will use his new powers to appoint at least two foreigners to the election watchdog .
But that will mean Karzai 's Afghan appointees would hold the balance of power in the commission and be unlikely to challenge his wishes .
In another development likely to infuriate the president 's western backers , he has defied US pressure to pass a separate decree to help fight corruption .
The failure to pass the decree before parliament returned to work on Saturday means a key pledge to enact new anti - graft laws legislation by the end of February , made by Karzai at the international conference on Afghanistan in London last month , will almost certainly not be met .
The US hoped the decree would include measures to strengthen and give independence to the High Office of Oversight , an anti - graft body set up last year that has been criticised for being overshadowed by the president , and also establish an international monitoring body .
It is now extremely unlikely that parliament will pass the legislation in time , and legal delays could hold it up indefinitely ."
2010-02-22,"At least 27 civilians were killed in a Nato air strike in southern Afghanistan yesterday , prompting a furious response from Afghan officials .
The airstrike – in which four women and a child are known to have died – brought a personal apology from General Stanley McChrystal , the Nato commander in Afghanistan , to the president , Hamid Karzai .
It added to growing anger over the number of civilian casualties in the Afghan conflict , and came hours after Karzai had urged Nato to do more to protect civilians .
In a statement , the Afghanistan council of ministers condemned the air strike as "" unjustifiable "" .
The cabinet said initial reports indicated that Nato had fired on a convoy of three vehicles , killing at least 27 people and injuring a further 12 .
McChrystal spoke to Karzai yesterday to express his regret and promise an investigation .
"" We are extremely saddened by the tragic loss of innocent lives , "" he said .
"" I have made it clear to our forces that we are here to protect the Afghan people and inadvertently killing or injuring civilians undermines their trust and confidence in our mission .
We will redouble our effort to regain that trust . ""
Syed Zahir Shah , the police chief of Kajran district , in Daikondi province , said he spent all day yesterday helping to recover body parts so they could be prepared for burial .
He said three four - wheel drive vehicles were hit while travelling through a Taliban area .
The vehicles were carrying passengers from Day Kundi province to various destinations , including Kandahar , Herat and Iran .
All the victims were Hazaras , the ethnic group from the central highlands who have always opposed the Taliban .
Shah said the injured included a six - year - old child who was taken for treatment in Uruzgan and a nine - year - old girl .
He said all the vehicles were entirely destroyed and that many of the bodies were so badly disfigured it was hard to identify them .
Locals say the injured were taken by helicopter to the US military base at Bagram , north of Kabul .
The attack triggered fury from local politicians , including Muhammad Hashim Watanwali , an MP from Uruzgan , who said Nato and Hamid Karzai had repeatedly promised to bring a stop to civilian casualties , including most recently at the opening of parliament on Saturday .
Amanullah Hotak , head of Uruzgan 's provincial council , demanded a government investigation into what happened .
He said : "" We do n't want their apologies or the money they always give after every attack .
We want them to kill all of us together instead of doing it to us one by one . ""
Nato confirmed that its planes had fired on what it believed was a group of insurgents on their way to attack a joint Nato and Afghan patrol in the southern Uruzgan province .
The organisation said it had later discovered that women and children had been hurt in the strike .
The incident was not part of Operation Moshtarak , the major offensive to combat the Taliban in Helmand province .
Zemeri Bashary , an Afghan interior ministry spokesman , said the airstrike hit three minibuses on a main road near the Uruzgan border with the central Day Kundi province .
Bashary said the 42 people in the vehicles were all civilians .
On Saturday , Karzai criticised Nato troops for not doing enough to protect civilian lives .
During a speech to the opening session of the Afghan parliament he called for extra caution from Nato .
"" We need to reach the point where there are no civilian casualties , "" Karzai said .
"" Our effort and our criticism will continue until we reach that goal . ""
Nato claims it has taken steps to reduce civilian casualties , primarily through reducing air strikes and tightening its rules of engagement .
However , in the offensive against Marjah , two Nato rockets killed 12 people in one house and others were caught in the crossfire .
Nato said at least 16 civilians had been killed during the offensive so far , although human rights groups claim the total is at least 19 .
Last Thursday , an air strike in the northern Kunduz province missed the insurgents it was targeting and killed seven policemen .
The continued loss of civilian lives will make it harder for Nato as it attempts to win the support of local Afghans against Taliban militants in the south ."
2010-02-22,"Hamid Karzai 's decision to take control of Afghanistan 's electoral watchdog by presidential decree is a terrible blow to the intended legacy of the 2001 invasion – fair elections , democratic institutions and a constitutional government .
By neutering the electoral watchdog , which included foreign experts , the president has taken personal control of the electoral process .
He already determines the makeup of the Independent Elections Commission , and now he will be in charge of appointing the Electoral Complaints Commission .
The ECC is something like a court of appeal against the IEC 's decisions , which last year blatantly favoured Karzai at the expense of others .
Having both institutions on his side , the president can be sure that the parliament elected this September will be dominated by his allies .
The parliament is not only important as a block on the executive – capable , as we have seen these past few months , of taking independent decisions and frustrating Karzai 's cabinet nominations – it also comprises a major part of the Loya Jirga assembly , which can change the constitution .
Combined with provincial council results which bear every hallmark of having been manipulated , September 's election may ensure the president a majority in the Loya Jirga .
That will be useful , if he ultimately wants to overturn the constitutional requirement that he should serve only two elected terms in office .
He can then stand for election again in 2014 , with the whole electoral machinery having been installed by him personally .
Karzai is the elected ruler of Afghanistan , and has the right to demand that many things should be done as he chooses : military strategy and government appointments , for example .
But not elections .
The ECC did its job fairly and courageously last year .
It is true that Afghans were baffled – and Karzai angered – by the lengthy and confusing tussle over the election 's results , which embarrassed Karzai but failed to force him to a second round .
Some Afghans will therefore be happy at a diminution in the involvement of foreigners in future elections .
But if the elections process is to be fully Afghan - run , then it is especially important to have the right balance of political parties and institutions represented and enfranchised .
Karzai has proposed that various Afghan institutions should each nominate a member for the ECC .
Although this is problematic , it at least gives a chance of a credible and inclusive political process .
The new decree does not ."
2010-03-03,"Policy rifts between the US and Britain make for good copy , especially in wartime .
The Washington Post , on its front page this morning , suggests there was a split between London and Washington over the Afghan president Hamid Karzai 's offer of reconciliation talks with the Taliban .
All are agreed that the only way to bring a semblance of peace to Afghanistan will require doing deals with the Taliban .
The difference is over timing .
According to the Post , the British government wants this done as fast as possible but the Obama administration wants to wait until later , when it has the upper hand militarily .
But the British position is more complicated than the Washington Post suggests .
The Foreign Office is divided .
There are some British diplomats – senior ones – who favour moving speedily to engage with the Taliban and not delay until next year , while others are backing the US line .
The British military are lining up with their US counterparts , arguing that it would be better to wait until the end of the offensive in Helmand province and the planned one in Kandahar , and then go into negotiations with the Taliban from a position of strength ."
2010-03-07,"They do not have a decent ground , they train and play all of their representative cricket outside their country , but Afghanistan 's cricketers are being feted as national heroes on the streets of Kabul and Jalalabad .
Their exploits have earned them an audience with President Hamid Karzai and dinner at the US Embassy , where the American ambassador promised to fund the construction of two cricket grounds .
All of this has been brought about by the extraordinary feat of qualifying , along with Ireland , for the Twenty20 World Cup , to be played in the Caribbean next month .
At the bottom of so many world indices , Afghanistan nonetheless came within a match of earning a place in next year 's World Cup proper and are now in the top 12 of world cricket 's newest format .
"" You can not believe the pride and satisfaction we all feel when our country does so well after enduring so much for so long , "" says Hilal Yasini , a prominent banker and blogger in the Middle East who , as a child , was forced to leave Afghanistan and live in a camp in Pakistan .
Only 20 years ago , cricket was unknown in the country .
Ten years later the sport had been banned by the Taliban , while Bushkazi – rugby on horseback with a sheep 's carcass – was the traditional national game .
"" It is now cricket that is most popular , "" said the all - rounder Raees Ahmadzai .
Posters of the team line the streets in Kabul and Jalalabad .
President Karzai seems to promise the players land , and cars every time he meets them .
Not that they have always received them .
But the players , on a maximum of £ 200 a month , have been given laptops , watches and cash by fans as reward for their success .
Thousands turned up in Dubai for the final of the ICC T20 qualifier against Ireland , the first time Afghanistan had played under lights , outnumbering the Irish supporters by about 200 to one .
More lined the streets , in the rain , to cheer the team from airport to hotel when they landed in Kabul after their T20 campaign .
They are much loved . ""
In the shops whenever we buy something we get another thing free ! ""
Ahmadzai said .
President Karzai himself was apparently a little put out that he could not meet the players earlier because of all their commitments .
Right after qualifying for the World T20 , Afghanistan chased down a mammoth 494 against Canada in Sharjah , on the fourth day of their latest first - class match .
After that victory , celebrations erupted across the eastern half of the country , with which came the obligatory fireworks , gunfire , singing and dancing .
Only two of which are officially frowned upon .
The American ambassador , Karl W Eikenberry , pledged US commitment to building two new grounds in Afghanistan .
Even though there are rumblings of discontent that a "" Pakistani game "" , learnt in the refugee camps , has become so prominent .
The team 's Pakistani coach Kabir Khan ( the son of an Afghan ) said : "" During cricket the guns are put down and the fingers come off the triggers .
Cricket is playing its part in bringing stability to the country . """
2010-03-10,"Britain will today urge the Afghan government to put more effort into the pursuit of peace talks amid fears that the war could be prolonged – and more British lives lost – as a result of incompetence and lack of political will in Kabul .
A speech to be delivered in the US by the foreign secretary , David Miliband , will reflect growing anxiety in London that President Hamid Karzai 's professed desire for a political solution has not been backed up by any serious planning or concrete proposals .
Unless more pressure is put on the Afghan government , some British officials predict that Karzai 's proposed loya jirga , or grand peace council , due at the end of next month , will be little more than a PR stunt .
"" My argument today is that now is the time for the Afghans to pursue a political settlement with as much vigour and energy as we are pursuing the military and civilian effort , "" Miliband will say at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , according to a text of the address seen by the Guardian .
British officials believe that significant Taliban leaders are ready to start talking about a political settlement in which they would sever ties with al - Qaida and put down weapons in return for a role in politics .
But there is also concern that opportunities to open a preliminary dialogue are being lost , and that the conflict , which has already cost more than 270 British lives , is being intensified by Kabul 's inefficiency and corruption . ""
The Afghans must own , lead and drive such political engagement , "" Miliband will say in his speech .
"" It will be a slow , gradual process .
But the insurgents will want to see international support . ""
International engagement , for example under the auspices of the UN , may ultimately be required . ""
Karzai presented a paper on political reconciliation at a conference held by Gordon Brown in London in January .
But officials who saw it , and subsequent Afghan proposals on peace talks , have variously described them as "" empty "" and "" a C - team effort "" .
Gerard Russell , at the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard University , said : "" We had a look at the Afghan government 's thinking on reconciliation , but we have n't seen a concrete proposal or a workable methodology . ""
Russell , a former political adviser to the UN mission in Afghanistan , added : "" There is a talk about having a loya jirga .
But what is a loya jirga going to do ?
On its own , its not going to achieve anything . ""
The growing alarm at the lack of political initiative in Kabul comes at a time when back - channel contacts with the Taliban have also run into trouble , paradoxically as a result of a Taliban arrest hailed as a triumph last month .
Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , the head of the Taliban 's military operations seized in Karachi by Pakistani intelligence agents , had taken part in tentative and secret contacts with Saudi intermediaries last year .
One participant in those talks told the Guardian that Baradar 's arrest had been "" a huge blow "" to the peace effort .
Britain 's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , has been sent to Kabul as caretaker ambassador , with the primary mission of trying to inject more substance into the loya jirga planned for 29 April .
Tomorrow , Miliband will also call for a direct international role in managing the peace process .
Miliband 's speech also carries a message for Washington .
While Britain 's Foreign Office believes work on peace talks should begin straight away and be pushed behind the scenes by the Obama administration , most US officials , and some British generals , question whether such negotiations would produce results before Taliban morale has been depleted by the military surge .
"" There is an important US audience for this , "" a British official said .
"" Nobody wants a PR stunt in Kabul that does n't lead anywhere . """
2010-03-11,"It must have felt very uncomfortable for President Hamid Karzai to have his guest and "" brother "" , Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , use a press conference in Kabul to attack Afghanistan 's main donor and ally , the United States .
"" They themselves created terrorists and now they 're saying that they are fighting terrorists , "" said Ahmadinejad , accusing the US of playing a "" double game "" in Afghanistan .
Ahmadinejad was in fact returning a compliment by the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , who only hours earlier had accused Tehran of "" playing a double game "" of offering friendship to the Afghan government while at the same time giving "" low - level support "" and money to the Taliban .
Karzai had always hoped to be the mediator between Iran and America , yet on this occasion , unwittingly , he became the messenger of abuse .
He looked distinctly uneasy in the press conference , never knowing what Ahmadinejad may come up with in his next sentence . ""
Your country is located on the other side of the world , so what are you doing here ? "" said Ahmadinejad , criticising the US presence in Afghanistan .
Yet he did n't seem to be full of novel ideas for resolving the complex web of problems facing Afghanistan .
He suggested empowering "" the Afghan government , the legal Afghan government , and the legal government 's running of the country and its security issues "" .
His stress on the word "" legal "" was not without reason .
Like his own second term , Karzai 's election was marred by fraud .
Both men in fact share the precarious status of being regarded as contested presidents .
They were both the first to congratulate each other after the doubtful results of their election were announced .
Yet despite sharing this relative lack of authority , and despite the deep historical and cultural ties that link Iran and Afghanistan , the two men have a lot that sets them apart .
In Ahmadinejad 's frame of mind , Karzai is regarded as an American stooge and weak .
Karzai , in turn , views Ahmadinejad as being far too much of a fundamentalist and not necessarily as well - intentioned as he likes to pretend .
Thus there is lingering underlying distrust .
While Karzai has frequently praised Iran 's aid , he is watching cautiously where Iran 's hundreds of millions of dollars are spent .
Although much has gone towards drug eradication and humanitarian aid , the bulk of projects funded by Iran are focused in Herat province in western Afghanistan , near the border with Iran .
Funds have been pouring in for road and rail reconstruction along the main transit route between the two countries .
This aids the flow of trade – especially non - oil exports from Iran to Afghanistan – steadily rising from over £ 50 m in 2001 , now estimated to be £ 665 m .
The former powerful governor of Herat , General Ismail Khan , is a close ally of Iran .
When defeated by the Taliban in 1995 , Khan fled to Iran with thousands of his men .
Now Iran is building on that connection , improving trade links through Herat while keeping an eye on American movements along its eastern border .
Iran is concerned that Washington may use this border for espionage activity or for mounting a potential attack against Iran .
A further source of concern for Karzai is that Iran has close ties to Shia Muslims led by Karim Khalili – another former mujahideen leader who is currently the vice - president .
His Islamic Unity party was funded by Iran during the years of civil war and was the second most potent force against the Taliban .
Iran now funds major projects in areas densely populated by Shias , such as in Bamyan .
Some American security analysts argue that Iran holds these ties with the former mujahideen "" warlords "" in order to have the possibility of causing tension should the need arise .
They could be right , since president Ahmadinejad spent the rest of his visit meeting with them . ""
History shows that invading powers have never been victorious in Afghanistan , "" said Ahmadinejad at a luncheon attended by former mujahideen leaders .
He then met with two more : Sebghatollah Mojaddedi and Younis Qanooni , now presiding over Afghanistan 's senate and parliament respectively .
It was by using its contacts with these leaders that Iran helped Washington defeat the Taliban in 2001 .
However , now many of them have moved on and prefer the international forces to remain in Afghanistan .
So Robert Gates is probably wrong to assume that Iran is funding the Taliban .
Iran has long been an enemy of the Taliban , regarding them as Wahhabi Muslims funded by Saudi Arabia .
It prefers instead to invest in those players who are both anti - Taliban and anti - American .
And although many of those are currently in key political positions , Iran knows that when the time is right , they will switch sides .
In that sense , the US defence secretary is probably right to be concerned about Iran playing a "" double game "" , but then Afghanistan has always been a land of international and local double games ."
2010-03-22,"Hamid Karzai has held face - to - face talks with active insurgents representing one of the most violent rebel leaders operating in Afghanistan , the Afghan president 's office said today .
Karzai 's spokesman said the unprecedented meeting took place "" a couple of days back "" between the president and top - level officials from the militant wing of Hezb - e - Islami , the movement run by Islamist warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar from his sanctuary in Pakistan .
According to the organisation 's spokesman Haroun Zarghoun , the delegates presented a 15-point plan , including a call for foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan within six months , starting in July .
Six months after that an interim government would be appointed and preparations made for fresh elections .
Matt Waldman , an independent analyst specialising in Taliban peace talks , said : "" It sounds like an opening position because they know these are demands that will not be granted . ""
Nonetheless , it was remarkable that such senior insurgent leaders were allowed to move freely around Kabul to attend the meeting with Karzai .
Representatives of Mr Hekmatyar , who is blacklisted by the US and the United Nations as an international terrorist , have participated in informal talks before , including a meeting in the Maldives , but it is not thought Karzai has ever taken part in such discussions himself .
Usually the president is represented by members of his national security council or by his brother Qayoum , a private citizen who plays a leading part in reconciliation policy .
Leading the delegation was Hekmatyar 's deputy Qutbuddin Helal and it also included his son - in - law and former spokesman .
A spokesman for the movement said they had full authority to speak on behalf of Hekmatyar and they also planned to meet other important Afghan leaders , including former mujahideen leaders Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and Burhanuddin Rabbani , as well as foreign ambassadors .
A spokesman for the British embassy said he was not aware of such a meeting but that the UK backed peace talks as long as they were led by the Afghan government .
The development is likely to please the British government , which wants to see immediate steps towards a political settlement with insurgent leaders .
However , the US is demanding a more gradual approach in the hope that if the extra 30,000 troops sent to Afghanistan this year chalk up major battlefield successes then insurgent leaders will be willing to be more flexible in their demands .
Waldman said the latest entreaties from one of Afghanistan 's most notorious warlords would further heighten divisions between the US and its main allies .
Hezb - i - Islami is allied to the Taliban and is dominant in the east of the country .
Over the years it has claimed responsibility for some of the most deadly and spectacular attacks on Kabul , including a brazen attempt to assassinate Karzai during a military parade in 2008 .
Although Hekmatyar has a reputation as an unbending radical Islamist , in recent months it has been rumoured that he is keen to strike a power - sharing peace deal with the government .
Some analysts have suggested that the overture from Hekmatyar could indicate that Hezb - i - Islami 's alliance with the Taliban movement led by Mullah Omar could be fraying .
Two weeks ago the two groups clashed in Baghlan province , leading large numbers of Hezb - i - Islami fighters to defect to the government .
Hekmatyar is one of the most controversial of the former mujahideen leaders who fought against the Soviet Union 's occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s and he served as prime minister of the country after the Moscow - backed government in Kabul finally fell in 1992 .
Karzai has already moved to accommodate powerful members of Hezb - i - Islami , which operates legally as a party and is represented by MPs and provincial governors ."
2010-03-24,"One of the main insurgent groups fighting the Afghan government and its Nato backers said today that it was ready to make peace and act as a bridge to the Taliban if the US began pulling out troops next year , as planned .
A spokesman for a delegation from the Hezb - i - Islami , which has been holding talks in Kabul this week with President Hamid Karzai , said the group 's initiative was prompted by Barack Obama 's declaration that American forces would begin to be drawn down .
"" There is a formula : ' no enemy is an enemy forever , no friend is a friend forever , ' "" Mohammad Daoud Abedi told Reuters . ""
If that 's what the international community with the leadership of the United States of America is planning – to leave – we had better make the situation honourable enough for them to leave with honour . ""
The talks between Karzai and Hezb - i - Islami appear to be at an early stage , and it is unclear how ready the Afghan president is to strike a deal with the group 's leader , Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a ferocious warlord who was responsible for reducing much of Kabul to rubble with his artillery in the 1990s .
It is also unclear how much influence Hezb - i - Islami would have on the Taliban .
The two groups have had a volatile relationship and clashed this month in northern Afghanistan .
"" We have only one common situation with the Taliban , which is the withdrawal of the foreign forces and the freeing of the country from the occupation , "" Abedi said .
"" The rest of the things , they have their opinion and we have ours .
We believe in free and fair elections , and the Taliban have a different idea . ""
He added , however , that his group could be "" a bridge between [ the ] two sides "" .
The Hezb - i - Islami delegation presented a 15-point peace plan to Karzai , which included a demand for foreign forces to begin withdrawing in July this year , but Abedi signalled that the group could be flexible on dates if Washington demonstrated good faith in its intentions . ""
First of all , this is not written in stone and it 's not the verse of the Qur'an , not to be changed .
This is a starting point , "" Abedi said .
"" If we agree on this departure date : OK , the US will leave .
Give us a timeframe .
They have said 18 months . ""
So if we come to an agreement , and preparations are actually taking place ... that is considered a positive step .
"" That is considered that the US really means withdrawal .
Because right now , there is a problem of trust between both sides .
"" The peace talks with Hezb - i - Islami will help provide some momentum for Karzai 's planned loya jirga – grand peace council – next month , but some observers question the real substance of the talks .
Michael Semple , a former UN and EU representative in Afghanistan , said : "" This is really politicking among those people already on board with the process .
This has nothing to do with ending the insurgency . ""
Semple , now at the Carr Centre for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University , said : "" This is a long way from pulling Gulbuddin in .
He has had feelers out for quite a while . ""
But in reality , Gulbuddin does n't have much to offer , and there are heavy costs for Karzai to bring him in .
He is toxic [ politically ] and very demanding . ""
US embassy spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said that American officials had no plans to meet Gulbuddin 's group ."
2010-03-28,"Barack Obama flew back from Afghanistan last night after a surprise visit to thank American and Nato troops stationed there and to press President Hamid Karzai to crack down on corruption .
US military and diplomats have repeatedly said that success on the battlefield against the Taliban would count for little unless the Karzai government begins to win over Afghans by improving governance and reducing corruption .
It was Obama 's second visit to Afghanistan , but his first as US president .
There was a news blackout on the trip , with reporters being told he was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat , Camp David .
The Afghan government was only informed on Thursday .
He spent only a few hours in Afghanistan , all of it under cover of darkness .
Obama , who flew directly to Afghanistan in a 13-hour trip , met Karzai in the palace in Kabul .
"" Progress will continue to be made , but we also want to make progress on the civilian front , "" Obama said .
His national security agency adviser , General Jim Jones , told reporters before the meeting that Obama would raise with Karzai progress on a series of benchmarks which Washington had set out on good governance and tackling corruption .
Jones said Obama would engageKarzai , who was re - elected last year , "" to make him understand that in his second term there are certain things that have been not paid attention to , almost since day one .
Things like a merit - based system for appointment of key government officials , battling corruption , taking the fight to the narco - traffickers , which fuels the economic engine for the insurgents . ""
Jones also referred to the importance of reconciliation and the unsuccessful attempts to do deals with moderate or loosely committed Taliban members .
Obama 's trip was intended to raise the morale of American troops before an offensive in Kandahar province that the US military has described as the pivotal point in the conflict .
Obama ordered 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan in November and that build - up is still under way .
The White House regards it as important for him to be seen with US troops at a time of war .
The visit came a week after he blunted criticism of his presidency by securing a major domestic success – health reform .
He is hoping to build on this momentum to resolve other outstanding issues , such as the closure of the Guantánamo Bay prison camp .
On Friday , he secured his first foreign policy triumph with the signing of a nuclear arms treaty with Russia .
But he is looking for a bigger success , such as a deal on the Iranian nuclear issue , the start of Israeli - Palestinian peace negotiations , or the relative stabilisation of Afghanistan and a phased withdrawal of US troops .
With US involvement in Iraq winding down , he is looking for a way in which he can begin to bring US troops back from Afghanistan before the end of his first term .
This would require the Taliban momentum to be reversed and the threat posed by al - Qaida and other militants along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border to be minimised .
But Afghanistan is proving to be more difficult than Iraq , given the lack of basic infrastructure in the country .
The White House said Obama invited Karzai to visit on 12 May.
Karzai 's last visit to Washington was marked by sustained criticism from the Obama administration about his failure to tackle corruption .
Obama , who flew the last stretch into Kabul by helicopter , said he had seen progress from the air , with much more electricity available than on his first visit .
The president was subjected to some low - key grumbling from the military about his failure to visit Afghanistan until yesterday .
He visited Iraq within months of his inauguration , but repeatedly delayed a trip to Kabul , even though the issue consumed the White House for several months last summer .
There were only 34,000 US troops in Afghanistan when Obama took over ; that will rise to an estimated 100,000 by next summer .
He addressed a crowd of about 2,500 US and Nato troops and civilians at Bagram airport near Kabul and thanked them for their efforts and sacrifice . ""
One of the main reasons I 'm here is to say thank you for the incredible efforts of our troops and coalition partners , "" he said .
"" They make tremendous sacrifices , far away from home , and I want to make sure they know how proud their commander in chief is of them . ""
Obama , who argued during the US election campaign that George Bush made a strategic error in switching resources and attention from Afghanistan to Iraq , told the crowd the mission was to stabilise Afghanistan enough to allow Afghan troops to take over security , allowing the US to pull out . ""
The United States is a partner but our intent is to make sure that the Afghans have the capacity to provide for their own security – that is core to our mission , "" he said ."
2010-03-28,"Barack Obama arrived in Afghanistan today for an unannounced visit fresh from his first major domestic success on healthcare reform .
In his first visit to the country since becoming president , Obama was expected to meet the embattled Afghan president , Hamid Karzai as well as other local and US officials , and give a speech to US troops .
Before the trip , a White House official said Obama wanted to get an "" on the ground update "" about the war from General Stanley McChrystal , the US and Nato commander , as well as Karl Eikenberry , the US ambassador .
Obama , who described Afghanistan as a war of necessity in contrast to Iraq , ordered an extra 30,000 US troops for to be sent in December and set a mid-2011 target for a withdrawal .
The decision came after months of painstaking deliberation that left the US president open to accusations of dithering .
Obama travelled to Afghanistan during the 2008 US presidential election but has not been back since his victory over John McCain , whose criticism at the time prompted the trip .
The White House official said weather and logistics had thwarted previous attempts at a presidential visit .
Public opinion in the US has turned against the war as it has in the UK .
The number of US troops killed in Afghanistan has roughly doubled in the first three months of 2010 compared with the same period last year .
US officials have warned that casualties are likely to rise even further as the Pentagon completes its deployment of the 30,000 additional troops and as Nato forces prepare an offensive against the Taliban 's home base in Kandahar province .
"" We must steel ourselves , no matter how successful we are on any given day , for harder days yet to come , "" Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said at a briefing last month .
Fifty - seven US soldiers were killed during the first two months of 2010 compared with 28 in same period last year , according to Pentagon figures compiled by The Associated Press .
At least 20 US service members have been killed so far in March , compared with 13 a year ago .
Britain , which has the second largest contingent , has lost at least 33 troops since 1 January , compared with 15 for the same period last year .
A British soldier was killed on Friday , bringing the total of British deaths since the war began in 2001 to 277 .
Obama faced serious domestic opposition over his December decision to increase troop levels in Afghanistan , with only about half the US public supporting the move .
But support for his handling of the war has actually improved since then , despite the increased casualties .
The latest Associated Press - GfK poll at the beginning of March found that 57 % of those surveyed approved his handling of the war in Afghanistan compared with 49 % two months earlier .
Michael O'Hanlon , a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution , said the poll results could partly be a reaction to last month 's offensive against the Taliban stronghold of Marjah in Helmand province .
US officials have said they plan to use many of the additional forces to reassert control in Kandahar province , where the Taliban have made big gains over the past few years in an effort to boost their influence over Kandahar city , the largest city in the south and the Taliban 's former capital .
Many analysts believe the Kandahar operation will be much more difficult than the recent Marjah offensive because of the greater dispersion of Taliban forces , the urban environment in Kandahar city and the complex political and tribal forces at work in the province .
The goal of both operations is to put enough pressure on the Taliban to force them to the negotiating table to work out a political settlement ."
2010-03-31,"Hamid Karzai 's attempt to seize control of Afghanistan 's electoral watchdog was overturned this morning by the country 's parliament , which voted overwhelmingly to throw out a presidential order that enraged diplomats .
In what one observer described as a "" sea of red cards "" , MPs in the lower house rejected a controversial decree by Karzai in February which unilaterally rewrote Afghan election law in advance of parliamentary poll in September .
The part of the decree that gave him the right to appoint all five members of the Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) also upset foreign diplomats who were still reeling from last summer 's presidential election , the credibility of which was undermined by widespread fraud .
After that poll , the three international members of the ECC appointed by the UN chief in Afghanistan denied Karzai a first round victory after ordering an investigation which discovered that almost 1 m of his votes were invalid .
According to a report this week in the New York Times , Karzai 's February decree so angered the White House that US officials cancelled his trip to Washington to meet Barack Obama .
Relations between the two men have since improved after Obama 's flying visit to Kabul this week , when it was announced that Karzai 's trip to Washington was back on .
Legal experts said that today 's vote by Afghan MPs cancels out the decree – which Karzai passed while parliament was on winter recess – and that the parliamentary elections would take place under the old rules , with the majority of ECC commissioners appointed by the UN .
Shukria Barakzai , an MP who backed Karzai in last year 's election , said she was surprised to see parliament vote overwhelmingly to revoke the decree when the institution is usually far more divided .
She said : "" It showed that no one is prepared to accept this election decree and that we want more transparent elections and we can not accept something that the president has decided on his own . ""
Barakzai added that MPs , many of whom will stand for re - election in September , had other concerns , including a new requirement to collect 1,000 signatures in order to register as a candidate .
Peter Lepsch , who was chief legal officer for the ECC during the 2009 elections , said : "" This is a great day for democratic processes in Afghanistan and I think that this is a moment that the Afghan legislator has stood up to provide a check on the executive branch . ""
Diplomats say MPs were also motivated by wider political issues , including dissatisfaction with Karzai and fears that the president is moving too rapidly towards a peace deal with insurgents ."
2010-04-02,"The Obama administration said today it was "" troubled "" by accusations from the Afghan president that the west was trying to weaken him and that foreign troops risked becoming an occupation force .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said there was concern over a speech yesterday in which Hamid Karzai sought to turn charges that he stole Afghanistan 's presidential election on their head by blaming what he termed "" vast fraud "" in last August 's poll on an attempt by the UN and international organisations to deny him victory or discredit his win .
Karzai also said that the 120,000-strong Nato - led foreign forces fighting the Taliban increasingly risked being seen as occupiers – a comment that led his main political opponent to accuse him of treason .
Gibb said that the Afghan president 's remarks "" are troubling … a real and genuine concern .
We are seeking clarification from President Karzai . ""
Karzai 's comments , broadcast on Afghan television , came after parliament rejected his bid to take direct control of Afghanistan 's electoral institutions .
But the remarks reflect a growing rift with the west , particularly in the wake of Barack Obama 's visit to Kabul last weekend during which he rebuked the Afghan leader for failing to clean up corruption or organise more transparent elections .
"" There is no doubt that the fraud was very widespread , but this fraud was not committed by Afghans , it was committed by foreigners , "" said Karzai in yesterday 's televised speech .
The Afghan president also accused foreign governments of trying to influence parliamentary elections later this year .
UN and western officials have been pressing for greater protections against fraud .
"" They want parliament to be weakened and battered and for me to be an ineffective president , and for parliament to be ineffective , "" said Karzai .
He also questioned the role of foreign forces in Afghanistan , saying : "" In this situation there is a thin curtain between invasion and co - operation assistance . ""
If coalition troops came to be seen as occupiers , the Taliban - led insurgency "" could become a national resistance "" , Karzai added .
Abdullah Abdullah , who lost to him in the disputed election , accused Karzai of undermining the morale of the Afghan military by implying that the country was under foreign occupation .
"" It was extraordinary … this is treason to the national interest .
What is the message to the thousands of soldiers and national police defending the country ?
"" he said . ""
[ Karzai ] thinks that by taking that message he has delivered a populist stance , an anti - foreigner message … he tried to blur the line between national resistance to terrorism and the insurgency .
"" Abdullah called the Afghan president 's recent behaviour erratic and said he is concerned . "" As a former colleague and doctor , I think this is beyond a normal attitude , "" he said ."
2010-04-06,"Relations between Washington and Kabul have become more tense recently , after two public attacks by Afghan President Hamid Karzai against western involvement in his country .
Just what has got into the Afghan president ?
Why is he attacking US President Barack Obama so much , when , in fact , compared to George Bush , Obama has been more committed to Afghanistan , both financially and militarily .
Is it possible that Karzai has already given up on the west ?
Has he decided to place his lot with regional countries such as Pakistan , and America 's rivals such as Iran and the Chinese instead ?
After all , the US is scheduled to start pulling its troops out of Afghanistan from July 2011 .
The British and the Canadians also seem to be planning a withdrawal starting from 2011 .
And the recent offensive in Marja is already facing severe setbacks , little more than a month after it started .
These are all valid concerns .
Even though the apparent target of Karzai 's attack sits thousands of miles away , if we look closely we can see that his real target audience is within his borders .
Karzai is trying to improve his image internally , especially with the Taliban .
How is he doing that ?
By attacking the west , which he blames for handing control of Afghanistan 's electoral watchdog to the UN .
He wants to transfer it to the Afghan government .
He knows that this issue is popular with the Taliban , who have accused him of being a western stooge .
But why should he care about the Taliban when they are attacking his own forces ?
The reason is that one of Karzai 's strategies , which he also made into a pre - election pledge , is that he sees negotiations with the Taliban as an ultimate winning strategy to bring peace .
He eventually wants to bring them on to his side by coming to some sort of agreement .
The last Iraqi government did the same with Muqtada al - Sadr 's forces .
Nouri al - Maliki launched an all - out assault against the Mahdi army in March 2008 .
Once Sadr agreed to a ceasefire Maliki allowed his party to run for elections .
In fact , if Maliki is asked to form the next Iraqi government , his State of Law alliance may well enter into a coalition government with Sadr 's Iraqi National Alliance .
What puzzles some strategists about Karzai 's behaviour is why now ?
Surely he would have a stronger negotiating position if he first waits for the Taliban to suffer heavy casualties from the new Nato assault and then approaches them for talks .
That way he would stand a better chance of reaching an accord on his term .
To try and approach the Taliban by making himself look anti - American now while the Taliban are strong and he is politically and militarily weak – as is currently the case – could have the opposite effect .
What could be an important reason behind his timing is that Karzai feels Pakistan is undermining his efforts to start a rapprochement with the Afghan Taliban .
This concern stems from the recent arrest of senior Taliban members by Pakistan .
At any other time , Karzai would have been happy about these arrests .
He has been asking the Pakistani government for years to stop supporting his arch enemies .
However , things are now different .
What the general public did not know about until recently is that the UN , with the presence of senior representatives of Karzai had been secretly meeting with the Taliban for more than a year .
The meetings were held in Dubai , where the Taliban members flew in from the hideouts in Pakistan .
And then , all of a sudden , Pakistan recently started to arrest senior Afghan Taliban leaders .
First was the deputy commander , Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar .
He was arrested in Karachi on 17 February .
By 4 March four other senior Taliban leaders were also arrested by the Pakistani government .
These arrests destroyed months of careful confidence building .
Although the two sides had not started negotiating yet , these "" talks about talks "" were the most genuine home - produced Afghan strategy to solve the country 's own problems between its own people – without interference from any foreign government .
Pakistan 's arrests of Afghan Taliban leaders put a stop to that , and now Karzai is in a rush to repair the damage , by launching verbal attacks against Americans .
He seems so adamant that he is now even threatening the west that he himself would be compelled to bring the Taliban into his government if his wishes regarding the transfer of the country 's electoral watchdog to the Afghan government are not met .
One factor likely to continue frustrating Karzai 's efforts to find stability at home is the fact that the handle for the door of peace in Afghanistan is to be found in Pakistan .
Some people believe that it can be retrieved with a compromise solution where both Afghan and Pakistani interests are included .
Others believe that Pakistan has no interest in handing it over until all its conditions are met and Afghanistan becomes its subservient client state .
There are far more people who believe the latter than the former .
Judging by recent events , they seem to be right ."
2010-04-07,"George Bush was an all - or - nothing sort of guy .
He either loved you – or he really hated you .
The former US president 's top bogeymen included Saddam Hussein , North Korea 's Kim Jong - il , and Jacques Chirac .
His pet favourites included Pakistan 's Pervez Musharraf , Tony Blair , and Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai .
The latter was a special chum .
After all , it was Bush who gave Karzai the top job in Kabul after kicking out the Taliban in 2001 .
All of which makes the current rift even more stark .
In Afghanistan , as elsewhere , Bush 's amours are Barack Obama 's heartaches .
Unlike his predecessor , Obama is not deaf to doubts about Karzai expressed by top officials like US ambassador Karl Eikenberry , who warned he was "" not an adequate strategic partner "" .
There has been scant effort to woo Karzai , and much criticism .
With little love lost on either side , Obama 's insultingly brief , first presidential visit to Kabul last week , under cover of darkness , was a wholly predictable disaster .
By all accounts , Obama was in his most condescending , holier - than - thou professorial mode – an attitude that would irritate a saint , let alone an under - pressure Pashtun pol with a drug problem ( if Peter Galbraith is to be believed ) .
He lectured Karzai on the need to entrench good governance , extirpate corruption , eliminate the narco - barons , and hold free , fair parliamentary elections in September .
Then , refusing a joint appearance , he left .
Karzai 's subsequent ranting against the west in general and the US in particular is not unconnected to this clumsily managed encounter .
But it also can not be separated from repeated American arm - twisting and name - calling dating back to last autumn , when Obama , vice - president Joe Biden and a host of other US political leaders lambasted him for manipulating the presidential polls .
Each time he has been shoved , Karzai has shoved back harder .
Thus when Obama withdrew an earlier invitation to the White House , Karzai responded by hosting a visit to Kabul in March of Washington 's latest bete noire , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran .
He may have intended it as a reminder that , when it comes to friends , Afghanistan has other options .
But it was a serious provocation all the same .
Last week , the US reported detecting a "" significant shipment of weapons from Iran into Kandahar "" , the scene of the coming , possibly climactic battle of the Afghan war .
A coincidence ?
Or cynical double - dealing ?
As usual it 's hard to say .
As commentator Fred Kaplan pointed out in Slate , US pot - stirring has made matters worse .
Shortly after Obama left Kabul , US media quoted unidentified senior officials saying Karzai 's half - brother , Ahmed Walid Karzai , head of Kandahar 's provincial council , should have his name added to a "" kill "" list . ""
Karzai assiduously reads the American press and is extremely sensitive to longstanding accusations that his brother is a drug lord , "" Kaplan said .
The anonymous threat , he quoted officials as suggesting , "" might have spurred him to make his wild - eyed remarks over the next three days "" .
Author Steve Coll , writing in the New Yorker from Kandahar , argues that the removal of Karzai frere ( known as AWK ) is both legitimate and necessary if the coming Kandahar offensive is to succeed .
As the US commander General Stanley McChrystal has acknowledged , military action will not work without an accompanying political strategy , including political reform .
"" Whatever the courtroom - ready evidence against him , there is no question but that AWK is the most visible , most intractable symbol of the corruption and corporate self - interest of the Karzai government in southern Afghanistan …
There is no single action the international community could insist upon that would have a greater impact on public opinion in Taliban country than the removal of AWK , "" Coll wrote .
The coalition 's political strategy in the south was already "" timid , improvised and compromised "" .
AWK 's continued presence might ensure its ultimate failure .
Whatever the truth of this contention , the Kandahar coup is n't going to happen .
McChrystal has reportedly decided , after a typical Obama - esque lengthy debate , that it 's better to deal with the devil you know than the devil you do n't .
For much the same reason , Obama and company know the US will also be obliged to continue to deal with Hamid Karzai at the national level .
The US needs Karzai because current alternatives are worse or unworkable .
It needs him because Obama dare not risk his 30,000-man surge and the crucial effort to hand off security to an enhanced Afghan military and police apparatus .
It needs him because it wants reasonably clean elections this autumn and a decent run at institution - building .
It needs Karzai because , eventually , the US will agree to multilateral talks with Taliban elements , and Karzai is already negotiating with some of them and with Pakistan .
Obama needs Karzai because , in not much more than a year , he intends to declare a sort - of victory in Afghanistan , like the sort - of victory in Iraq , and start bringing the troops home .
More than that , though Washington is not in the mood to admit it , Karzai will remain because , as Karzai himself cannily calculates , Afghans historically want a leader who is prepared , on occasion , to stand up and fight for their sovereign rights – and to tell the big foreign powers where to shove it ."
2010-04-07,"The war of words between the former deputy head of the UN mission to Afghanistan and the country 's president escalated last night when Peter Galbraith suggested that Hamid Karzai 's "" mental stability "" was in question and that he has a substance abuse problem .
Galbraith , the US diplomat who worked for the UN in Kabul until last year , made his remarks live on US television .
His comments come as the White House considers withdrawing an invitation for Karzai to meet Barack Obama in Washington next month .
Galbraith , the former UN deputy special representative in Afghanistan , was responding to allegations first made by Karzai last Thursday that the international community and Galbraith in particular had been responsible for "" massive fraud "" during last year 's disastrous presidential election .
"" He 's prone to tirades , he can be very emotional , act impulsively , "" Galbraith said on MSNBC television . ""
In fact some of the palace insiders say that he has a certain fondness for some of Afghanistan 's most profitable exports . ""
When asked whether he was saying Karzai had a substance abuse problem , Galbraith said there were "" reports to that effect "" . ""
This continued tirade raises questions about his mental stability and frankly this has been of concern to diplomats in Kabul . ""
Siamak Hirawi , a presidential spokesman , rejected Galbraith 's claims and said the palace condemned the US diplomat 's remarks . ""
What Mr Galbraith said is far away from the principle of diplomacy and it simply confirms what President Karzai was saying about [ Galbraith 's ] involvement in corruption . ""
A White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , has said the US will consider cancelling Karzai 's invitation to meet Obama in Washington on 12 May in the light of any "" further remarks "" the Afghan president makes .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , has intervened in the row , saying that "" malign suggestions "" the UK was involved in interfering with the elections were "" completely without foundation "" .
Karzai 's claims that foreigners were responsible for "" very widespread fraud "" during the election were first made shortly after Barack Obama made a fleeting visit to Kabul last week .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , tried to defuse the row during a phone call with Karzai on Friday , but he went on to repeat his claims to Afghan MPs and rhetorically threatened to "" join the Taliban "" if foreigners continued to interfere in the country 's affairs .
On Sunday , during a trip to Kandahar , he told the BBC that he stood by his allegations despite the furore they had created .
There is some evidence that by sticking up for Afghan sovereignty he has gained some kudos among ordinary Afghans , but many MPs and members of the country 's establishment have been horrified to see him jeopardise the critical Afghan - US relationship .
The controversy has emboldened his enemies to bring to public attention two issues that hitherto had been confined to the Kabul diplomatic rumour mill : Karzai 's mental health and his alleged use of drugs .
Last week Abdullah Abdullah , the opposition leader who polled second in last year 's election , said Karzai 's behaviour recently had been "" erratic "" and that "" as a former colleague and doctor
I think this is beyond a normal attitude "" .
In a move seen by some as a tactic to calm the row with his key allies , the Afghan government has announced that the much criticised head and deputy head of the country 's election commission has stepped down and will not oversee September 's parliamentary vote .
The retirement of Azizullah Ludin and Daoud Ali Najafi had been a key condition of the international community , which had threatened to withhold funding for the next election .
One western diplomat said the announcement had been long expected .
"" The question now is who Karzai appoints to replace them and whether it is a constructive or spiteful appointment .
Will he simply pick another Ludin or will he find someone who is impartial ? """

2010-04-07,"The Obama administration is to step up efforts to bypass Hamid Karzai after a series of controversial remarks by the Afghan president over recent days renewed concern about his reliability as an ally .
With relations between Washington and Kabul at a new low , the former UN envoy to Kabul Peter Galbraith said Karzai 's comments raised questions about his mental stability and blamed them on alleged drug use .
Galbraith , an American who was the former deputy UN chief in Afghanistan , was responding to allegations first made by the Afghan president last Thursday .
Karzai said the international community , and Galbraith in particular , had been responsible for "" massive fraud "" during last year 's disastrous presidential election . ""
He 's prone to tirades , he can be very emotional , act impulsively , "" Galbraith said on MSNBC television . ""

What Mr Galbraith said is far away from the principle of diplomacy and it simply confirms what President Karzai was saying about [ Galbraith 's ] involvement in corruption , "" said Hirawi .
The White House yesterday threatened to cancel a visit by Karzai scheduled for 12 May unless his behaviour improved in the interim .
The Obama administration has described as troublesome remarks by Karzai that included : accusing the US , UK and UN of orchestrating fraud in last year 's election and attempting to establish a puppet government in Kabul ; a reported threat to join the Taliban if Washington keeps putting pressure on him ; a description of Nato forces as an army of occupation ; and a suggestion that the people of Kandahar province would have a veto over an impending Nato offensive there .
Karzai 's spokesman today denied he had made the remark about threatening to join the Taliban .
But Karzai 's behaviour over the last week has confirmed the White House 's long - held view that he can not be trusted .
The Afghan president was unreliable , an Obama administration official said .
The official added that while the US can not afford to write Karzai off and would continue to deal with him , it will focus on ways to work round him .
One of these will be to step up efforts to bypass him and work directly with provincial governments , a long - held ambition that has so far made only limited progress .
The White House is concerned that attempts to bolster provincial governors have fallen well behind schedule .
There was a hint today that Kabul thinks the row with Washington and Nato has gone on long enough , when it announced two senior officials from Afghanistan 's independent electoral commission had resigned their posts – a key demand of the international community .
Azizullah Ludin , the IEC chairman , and Daoud Ali Najafi , the chief electoral officer , were accused of not doing enough to tackle fraud during last year 's poll .
But the Guardian has learned that diplomats fear Karzai is planning to appoint a key ally , Abdul Karim Khurram , to head the commission , a move that would be unlikely to satisfy western demands for an impartial election chief .
A senior western diplomat welcomed the IEC resignations but said they were "" just symbolic "" and that the real test would be whether the new appointments were "" spiteful or constructive "" .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , weighed into the row over Karzai 's remarks , saying the "" malign suggestions "" that the UK was involved in "" irregularly interfering in the election process of Afghanistan is completely without foundation "" .
Karzai 's claims that foreigners were responsible for "" very widespread fraud "" were first made shortly after Barack Obama 's fleeting visit to Kabul last week .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , tried to defuse the row during a phone call with Karzai on Friday , but he went on to repeat his claims to Afghan MPs .
On Sunday , during a trip to Kandahar , he told the BBC that he stood by his allegations , despite the furore they had created .
Abdullah Abdullah , the runner up in last year 's presidential election , said the resignation of the two men was "" not enough at all "" .
"" The problem is the system where Karza appoints the people who work at the IEC .
There are thousands of people who work there and just getting rid of two of them will not change anything . ""
Even if the international community gets its way , the rows and allegation of drug taking will damage Karzai 's reputation abroad and at home .
While parts of the Afghan media have cheered Karzai for standing up to his international patrons , others have been alarmed that the vital relationship between Afghanistan and the US could be undermined .
Massoud Rahman , a retired army colonel , said he was "" really saddened "" by recent events .
"" There 's no doubt that there could be some foreigners who are interfering with Afghanistan 's internal issues
but he is the president and he should not behave like this , particularly when so many countries are here to help us . ""

The allegations of drug use were not made by the US administration ."
2010-04-12,"Soothing words from Washington at the weekend , aimed at placating Afghanistan 's president Hamid Karzai after last week 's public falling out , follow a familiar pattern .
The White House was livid with Gordon Brown over last year 's release to Libya of the Lockerbie bomber .
But things were patched up once tempers cooled .
Now James Jones , Barack Obama 's national security adviser , is claiming US relations with Israel are "" fine "" despite the furious row over prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu 's refusal to halt Jewish settlement expansion in east Jerusalem , as demanded by Obama .
Secretary of state Hillary Clinton was similarly conciliatory at the weekend , extolling the virtues of "" strategic patience "" .
But relations are anything but fine , if the truth were told .
The Obama team knows it can not allow the present impasse to persist indefinitely , with Israel and the Palestinians declining even to begin the "" proximity talks "" to which both are committed .
Jordan 's King Abdullah sounded a grim warning last week about growing hostility towards Israel among so - called moderate Arabs .
His message to Obama : do something , and do it soon , or you will regret it .
Obama may hear similar calls from Egypt , Saudi Arabia and other regional countries attending this week 's nuclear summit in Washington ( which Netanyahu has boycotted ) .
Meanwhile , the imposition by the Israeli army of tougher residency rules in the occupied West Bank that rights groups say could allow the deportation of thousands of Palestinians represents another nasty surprise for Washington from Netanyahu 's recalcitrant government .
Does Obama have a plan ?
Not yet , but one appears to be in the works .
Reports speak of a possible new US demarche in which Obama would table a grand peace initiative , multilateral in approach and embracing all the parties to the Arab - Israeli conflict , not just Palestinians and Jews .
The proposal would be a composite of the 2000 Camp David blueprint , which so nearly took hold , and the 2002 Arab peace plan , plus various subsequent refinements .
Such an initiative was discussed by Obama , Jones and six former national security advisers at a recent White House meeting .
According to Washington Post columnist David Ignatius , Brent Scowcroft , who advised George Bush Snr , led the charge for a bold new opening , backed by Colin Powell , Frank Carlucci and Sandy Berger .
Their argument was that the "" incrementalist "" , step - by - step approach favoured by Obama 's chief envoy , George Mitchell , has failed .
Even if proximity talks got off the ground , they would quickly stall , they said .
Thus a sort of grand - slam deal , before the end of Obama 's first term , was the way to go .
The basics are already in place ( though far from agreed ) : compensation for displaced Palestinians instead of a right of return ; the sharing of Jerusalem , with a special dispensation for the Old City 's holy sites ; Israel 's withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders , with some territorial adjustment and swaps ; international security guarantees encompassing in particular the Jordan valley ; and Arab recognition of Israel .
Zbigniew Brzezinski , Jimmy Carter 's national security adviser , has since stepped up the pace , urging Obama to make an Anwar Sadat - style "" journey for peace "" by conducting Arab and peace - process leaders in joint appearances at the Knesset ( Israel 's parliament ) and the Palestinian legislature in Ramallah .
"" Only a bold and dramatic gesture in a historically significant setting can generate the political and psychological momentum needed for a major breakthrough , "" he said .
Although Jones emphasises that nothing is yet decided , pressure on Obama to make a move is mounting .
The Palestinians would applaud more direct US "" ownership "" of a rebooted peace process ; the Arabs might see it as an endorsement of their position ; and as Seth Freedman argues on Cif today , Israelis would welcome the economic boom that would follow a settlement .
And then , conversely , there 's the certainty that if the peace process definitively dies , extremists on both sides will try to fill the vacuum .
Recent clashes in Gaza should be seen as a red alarm : renewed fighting suits those who oppose a compromise peace .
White House officials see another big upside : ending the Arab - Israeli standoff would make it much easier to present a united front to Iran .
It might also reduce anti - American sentiment in the Muslim world and thus assist US policy aims in Afghanistan , Iraq and in the "" war on terror "" – although foreign policy specialists such as Ray Takeyh are sceptical that Arab governments will ever agree to confront Tehran , even if peace reigns throughout the region .
As Obama ponders his next move , the big question is how Israel 's rightwing leadership , and its American supporters , would react to any US effort to prescribe or impose the broad terms of a settlement – and what to do if Netanyahu refused to go along .
Such a collision , potentially fracturing the US - Israel relationship , could make the row over east Jerusalem look like a minor spat .
And the biggest beneficiary would be both countries ' biggest antagonist – Iran ."
2010-05-05,"Top Taliban leaders could be offered exile outside Afghanistan if they agree to stop fighting the government of Hamid Karzai , a long - expected peace plan by the Afghan government will propose later this month .
The far - reaching proposals , seen by the Guardian , also call for "" deradicalisation "" classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs created for foot soldiers who renounce violence .
The long - delayed Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme has emerged just as Karzai prepares to go to Washington for talks with Barack Obama , where the issue is likely to be top of the agenda .
The plan will then be presented later in the month to a gathering of representatives from across Afghanistan called the National Consultative Peace Jirga .
Once agreed upon , the government will be able to start spending around $ 160 m ( £ 100 m ) pledged by the international community to lure fighters away from the conflict .
The document refers to such fighters as "" angry brothers "" , reflecting the belief that a substantial portion of insurgents are not motivated by strong ideological beliefs .
Little is said in the report about the Taliban leaders managing the war against Karzai 's government .
However , it does say insurgent leaders could face "" potential exile in a third country "" .
Saudi Arabia has been used in the past for such purposes , and there has been widespread speculation that exile could be offered to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , the leader of the Hizb - e - Islami armed group , which in March sent a peace delegation to Kabul for talks with Karzai .
Western powers are likely to be pleased by the level of detail about the new High Level Peace Council , which will take over from a notoriously chaotic predecessor body accused of reintegrating fighters who subsequently took up arms again .
However , diplomats are worried that the government lacks the capacity to implement a programme that calls for complex activities in around 4,000 villages most affected by the insurgency .
One diplomat said : "" For the international community money is not a problem , they will pay whatever it takes .
One gets a sense that there are people on the military side who will do most of the work and then give it some sort of an Afghan face . ""
The High Council and its executive body will be in charge of processing fighters who want to live peacefully .
They will initially be put in "" demobilisation centres "" for a "" cooling off "" period of 90 days where their needs can be assessed and their personal security assured .
If they agree to lay down their arms and cut ties with al - Qaida they will be entitled to an amnesty against prosecution for any crimes they may have committed .
They will also be issued with a biometric "" reintegration card "" .
They will then be offered a "" menu "" of options designed to keep them peacefully occupied , including vocational training in such trades as carpet - weaving and tailoring .
There will also be the option to go through "" deradicalisation "" training , of the sort pioneered by Saudi Arabia .
However , the report acknowledges the complexity of such programmes , the lack of "" adequate experience "" in Afghanistan and the likely need to send "" highly radicalised "" people to other countries for treatment .
Major new institutions will also be set up to manage enormous job - creation schemes .
An Engineering and Construction Corps will focus on labour - intensive work , such as the construction of Afghanistan 's national highway system and other large - scale infrastructure projects .
It also envisages teams of ex - Taliban fighters being rapidly deployed to respond to emergencies such as floods and landslides .
By far the most controversial option is the option for former insurgents to join the Afghan army or police force .
Western embassies and Nato have for months been impatient for the government to produce a reintegration strategy , which is an important part of the counterinsurgency plan being pursued by Stanley McChrystal , the US commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan .
On the other hand , it has been widely reported that Karzai is frustrated at US opposition to high - level peace talks with insurgent leaders .
However , both US and Afghan officials say there is only disagreement on the timing of the talks and , to the frustration of the UK , which wants to see a high - level political accommodation with the Taliban , both sides are determined that there should be no significant compromise .
Last week Ahmed Wali Karzai , the Afghan president 's hugely influential half - brother , told the Guardian that while fighters could surrender and return in peace , the Afghan government would never share power with the Taliban or give in to demands for the country 's constitution to be changed in return for peace .
Speaking at his home in Kandahar , he said : "" Give them Uruzgan , Kandahar and Helmand ?
Change the constitution ?
No way , they are a defeated force , they are running , they are hiding , they are defeated . ""
His remarks echo those of a senior presidential aide who said Karzai has no interest in a grand deal with the Taliban movement as a whole , but is interested in talking to individuals in order to "" chip away at and weaken the insurgency "" .
It is thought that the offer to return home to Afghanistan from their sanctuaries in Pakistan and live without the fear of being killed by Nato forces would be enough to encourage people to give up .
However , Harvard analyst Matt Waldman said the Taliban would only be happy with significant change to the current political set - up in Afghanistan .
"" From my discussions with Taliban commanders it is clear they are driven to fight by predatory politics , the abuse of power and perception of military aggression .
Until these causes are addressed the fighting will go on . ""
Peace plan •
Taliban foot soldiers will be encouraged by provincial and district governors to reintegrate into society .
An initial 90-day cooling - off period will decide how they can be helped .
•
They will vow not to fight against the government , and disavow al - Qaida .
The authorities will hold their biometric profile , including fingerprints and iris scans .
•
To help former fighters support themselves , the government will offer vocational training in trades such as tailoring and electrical repairs .
•
Thousands of manual jobs in construction and agriculture will be created for reintegrated rebels .
Others may join their local police force or the army .
•
The programme will be initially rolled out in the provinces of Kandahar , Helmand , Herat , Baghdis , Nangarhar , Kunduz , and Baghlan .
It will affect 220 districts and around 4,000 villages .
•
Insurgent leaders who reconcile themselves with the government may be removed from the UN 's terrorist blacklist and possibly be offered "" exile in a third country "" ."
2010-05-09,"Barack Obama has ordered his top officials to take a gentler approach towards the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , who arrives in Washington tomorrow for a potentially fraught meeting after a period of prickly disagreements over troop withdrawals , corruption and security .
According to the Washington Post , Obama has told his national security team to show more respect to Karzai and to pull back from public criticisms of the Afghan leader , who was re - elected last year in a contest marred by deep irregularities .
Relations have soured in recent months , with Karzai alarmed that the US has set a deadline of July 2011 for the start of troop withdrawals .
Last month Karzai accused foreign governments , including the US , of causing fraud in last year 's presidential election and even reportedly threatened to join the Taliban if he did not get better treatment .
The relationship hit a low point after a visit by Obama to Kabul at the end of March , when Karzai took offence at remarks made by the White House 's national security adviser , James Jones .
At the time , Jones told reporters that Obama intended to "" make [ Karzai ] understand that there are certain things that have been not paid attention to , almost since day one "" by the Afghan government .
Shortly afterwards , Karzai was angered by media reports that his brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai , could become a target for US military because of his alleged involvement with drug lords .
A senior Obama administration official told the Washington Post that although there had been a "" rough patch "" , things were improving : "" Some of what Karzai said needed to be responded to .
But the bottom line is that there has been an improvement since then in the atmospherics and in the substance of our dealings with President Karzai and his team . ""
Obama hopes to convince Karzai that he has a longer term commitment to rebuilding Afghanistan through economic and non - military aid beyond the withdrawal of troops .
But there is still a sense in US circles that Karzai has not done enough to tackle corruption and the influence of drug warlords in Afghanistan .
The US military presence in Afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular at home , with 52 % of Americans feeling that the war is not worth fighting , according to a poll published todayby ABC and the Washington Post .
Since the start of his administration , Obama has adopted a policy of "" tough love "" towards Karzai – a contrast to the warm relationship built by George Bush , who held regular video conferences with the Afghan leader ."
2010-05-11,"Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , and Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , today brushed aside recent public arguments between Kabul and Washington over strategy for defeating the Taliban and corruption in Afghanistan .
Surrounded by senior military and civilian officials from both countries , Clinton and Karzai attempted to portray the splits as the kind of mature debate that takes place between allies .
At the start of an all - day meeting between US and Afghan commanders , ministers , and officials , Clinton said : "" The ability to disagree on issues of importance to our respective countries and peoples is not an obstacle to achieving our shared objectives .
Rather , it reflects a level of trust essential to any meaningful dialogue and enduring strategic partnership . ""
Karzai commented : "" As two mature nations and two mature governments … we will be having disagreements from time to time . ""
But relations behind - the - scenes between the US and the Karzai government remain difficult , with continued lack of faith in Washington in the Afghan president .
There is also US infighting about overall strategy , with the Pentagon favouring short - term fixes and the state department long - term ones , as well as serious doubts about Barack Obama 's timetable on withdrawing US troops starting July next year .
There are 78,000 US troops in Afghanistan .
The Obama administration decided a month ago that publicly berating Karzai over the level of corruption inside his government was counterproductive .
The US president is to see Karzai at the White House tomorrow , a meeting that only last month the White House suggested might not happen after Karzai criticised western powers and suggested he might ally himself with the Taliban .
Progress in Afghanistan has been slower than the Obama administration had expected , undermining the US timetable for the transfer of responsibility for security to Afghan forces and allowing withdrawal of US troops to begin .
US officials predict a large American and Nato military presence in the country for a long time after July next year .
David Sedney , a US deputy assistant secretary of defence , told the Senate foreign relations committee this month that there were not nearly enough trained Afghan forces to take over Taliban - controlled areas such as Marja , in Helmand , even after it was cleared by Nato forces .
The failure to move sufficient numbers of Afghan troops and officials into Marja is ominous for the impending offensive to secure Kandahar , a tougher proposition ."
2010-05-12,"Eager to head off questions about its long - simmering tensions with Hamid Karzai , the Obama administration is rolling out the red carpet for the Afghan leader this week , granting him unprecedented access to Washington 's top brass and royal treatment denied to even the closest of US allies .
It is a calculated , pragmatic decision to engage and provide deference – in public , at least – to a man who has mused about joining the Taliban and scuttled Barack Obama 's push to turn the tide in the nearly nine - year - old Afghanistan war .
The move follows decisions by Obama , the consummate risk mitigator , to pick inscrutable legal scholar Elena Kagan to serve on the nation 's highest court and to quickly retreat when his measured criticism of staunch US ally Israel backfired .
For imperfect as he may be , Karzai remains the product of America 's long embroilment in his rugged mountainous country , and the head of a government that must gain the trust of its own people if American GIs can ever hope to come home for good .
But do n't be fooled by appearances .
Tensions are still boiling just below the surface .
For all the pomp and circumstance of the four - day visit by the Afghan president and his posse of cabinet ministers and senior advisors to the US capital , the Obama administration is working hard behind the scenes to weaken his authority by reinforcing local governance to boost elusive stability of a war - torn country .
The US military views strong local governance as a key element of success in its military offensive against the Taliban this summer .
General Stanley McChrystal , the commander of US and Nato troops in Afghanistan , said the Kandahar operation would play a "" decisive "" role in the ongoing war as US presence nears 100,000 troops .
It was just last summer , as Obama put the final touches on his Afghanistan - Pakistan strategy , that the US ambassador to Kabul , Karl Eikenberry , wrote a pair of scathing memos to Washington that questioned Karzai 's competence and reliability as a partner in Washington 's war to crush the Taliban and its al - Qaida allies .
But on Monday , Eikenberry , who flew in with Karzai , said interests between the two countries were "" never better aligned "" .
Afghanistan , he said , "" is a close friend and ally
and of course I highly respect President Karzai in that capacity [ as elected leader ] "" .
And Richard Holbrooke , the US envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan said to have engaged in heated exchanges with Karzai over alleged presidential vote - rigging and corruption last year , went out of his way to personally greet his one - time foe .
While acknowledging that "" there was a period where the waters got roiled "" , he insisted those rocky times were now a thing of the past .
Months spent calling Karzai 's own legitimacy into question are now being rewarded with a dizzying schedule of lengthy face - to - face meetings with top Obama administration officials – a dinner hosted by secretary of state Hillary Clinton at the prestigious Blair House guest residence , day - long talks at the state department , press conference with the US president , a White House lunch and a dinner at vice - president Joe Biden 's residence .
Karzai is also meeting with congressional leaders , speaking at a public forum with Clinton and visiting America 's war dead at Arlington national cemetery .
High on the agenda are efforts to formulate a joint strategy for political reconciliation and reintegration of the Taliban and other insurgents .
Karzai says those gestures are crucial , but need US and Nato support .
Although the Obama administration has indicated it may allow negotiations with lower and mid - level Taliban members to move forward , it has been queasy about any talk of extending an outreached hand to top Taliban leaders who provided a safe haven for al - Qaida in the lead - up to the 9/11 attacks .
Washington has also backed away from providing a timeline for such negotiations , just as Karzai plans to hold a traditional Afghan peace jirga , or consultative assembly , after his visit .
And any US support for reconciliation faces a tough sell on the domestic front , now that would - be Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad has been linked , by the US , to the Pakistani Taliban .
It 's a risk Obama is unlikely to take just months before congressional elections in November during which his fellow Democrats are expected to take a beating .
US officials are also eager to dispel Afghan and Pakistani fears that the US will turn its back on both of them , as in 1988 , when US troops withdrew from Afghanistan following the end of Soviet invasion , and in 1992 , when the US cut off aid to Pakistan in the midst of its political crisis .
"" We will not abandon the Afghan people , "" Clinton reassured Karzai , as he sat by her side . "" Our civilian commitment will remain long into the future . ""
Karzai , meanwhile , is seeking specifics on US plans to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan in the middle of next year and calling attention to rising civilian casualties – another source of tensions with the White House ."
2010-05-12,"Barack Obama warned today that coalition forces in Afghanistan faced months of hard fighting , but said they had started to "" reverse the momentum of the insurgency "" by taking the fight to the Taliban .
Speaking after a meeting at the White House with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , Obama said the deployment of thousands more troops was paying off .
"" There are many difficult days ahead in Afghanistan .
We face a determined and ruthless enemy but we go forward with confidence , "" he said .
Obama said the Afghan government and its allies could not hope to win through military means alone but that keeping up the fight against what he called a brutal insurgency was essential as part of a strategy to encourage Taliban supporters to abandon the conflict . ""
The incentives for the Taliban to lay down arms and make peace with the Afghan government in part depends on our effectiveness in breaking their momentum militarily , and that 's why we put in the additional US troops , "" he said .
The two leaders papered over the bitter public differences of recent months , in which the Americans made it clear they considered corruption under the Karzai government was alienating much of the population and undermining the fight against the Taliban .
The Afghan leader accused the west of wanting a puppet government in Kabul .
Following on from the tone of Karzai 's meeting with the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , on Tuesday , Obama sought to underplay the divisions . ""
A lot of them were simply overstated , "" said Obama "" Obviously there are going to be tensions in such a complicated , difficult environment , in a situation in which on the ground both Afghans and Americans are making enormous sacrifices .
"" We 've had very frank discussions , and President Karzai agrees with me that we ca n't win through a military strategy alone .
That we 're going to have to make sure that we have effective governance , capacity building , economic development , in order for us to succeed . ""
Karzai responded that there had been differences and would continue to be so but that the relationship was strong .
"" There are days when we are happy , there are days when we are not happy .
It 's a mutual relationship towards a common objective .
Definitely days come when we 've had a difference of opinion .
Definitely days will come in the future when we will have a difference of opinion .
But the relationship between the two governments and the two nations is strong and well rooted and has endured the past 10 years of extreme activity.""Asked about the role of Pakistan in the conflict by an Afghan reporter who called its leaders "" two - faced "" , Obama said that Pakistan 's leaders needed to understand that the security of all the countries involved are intertwined and that extremist organisations are a "" cancer in their midst "" that threaten Pakistan 's sovereignty ."
2010-05-12,"Barack Obama took the opportunity of David Cameron 's arrival in Downing Street to press the reset button on US - UK relations , praising the prime minister and talking up historic ties between the two countries .
Cameron was barely through the door of No 10 on Tuesday when he received a call from Obama congratulating him and telling him the US has "" no closer friend and ally than the United Kingdom "" .
The president reiterated this today at a White House press conference with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
Obama said of Cameron : "" I find him to be a smart , dedicated , effective leader and somebody who we are going to be able to work with very effectively . ""
He reaffirmed , without me bringing it up , his commitment to our strategy in Afghanistan . ""
Obama added : "" We also both reaffirmed the extraordinary special relationship between the United States and Great Britain , one that outlasts any individual party , any individual leader .
It is built up over centuries and it 's not going to go away . ""
The speed at which Obama congratulated Cameron and the warmth of his words about the "" special relationship "" contrasted with the often messy relationship that existed between him and Gordon Brown .
Obama will meet Cameron at a G20 summit in Washington next month but he also extended an invitation , on behalf of himself and his wife , to Cameron and Samantha Cameron to visit DC in July .
Intent on cementing good relations quickly , the foreign secretary , William Hague , is to visit Washington on Friday for talks with the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton .
Reginald Dale , a senior fellow at the Washington - based Centre for Strategic and International Studies , said he was surprised at how warm Obama 's statement was . ""
He seemed to make a bigger effort than he ever did with Gordon Brown .
He has not shown much fondness for Britain so far and he has treated Britain as a country he will talk to only when it is useful to him , "" said Dale .
"" It seems as if someone has been advising him to start with a clean sheet . ""
Dale added that Cameron , who he described as smooth and presentable , might establish a better rapport with Obama than "" crusty old Brown "" .
Obama met Cameron in 2008 on a visit to Britain as part of his presidential election campaign .
Journalist Richard Wolffe , who was on the trip and is close to White House staff , wrote in Renegade , his biography of Obama , that Obama 's aides "" preferred the energy of the up - and - coming Cameron compared with the dour and dreary Brown "" .
The Obama - Brown relationship was dogged by reported snubs that included removal of a Churchill bust from the White House and a shoddy choice of gifts for the prime minister on a visit to DC .
But Obama tends to be businesslike and his relationship with Brown was no cooler than that between him and the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , or the German chancellor , Angela Merkel .
Britain and Europe , though partners with the US in Afghanistan , have tended to be on the second tier of Obama 's priorities .
The president sees the prime area of US interest in the future as China and the Pacific .
The US media devoted more space to the British election than they normally do to overseas political events , with coverage in print and on television of election night and the subsequent horsetrading .
The New York Times and the Washington Post led with Cameron becoming prime minister .
Mark Blyth , a politics professor at Brown University , joked that "" maybe it was a slow news day "" before attributing the interest to the novelty of a hung parliament .
Blyth identified three points of potential contention with Britain 's new government : Washington 's concern over the size of the UK debt ; Britain backing away from spending on US defence projects ; and Conservative antipathy towards the EU .
The Obama administration backs the idea of a strong , unified Europe .
"" The US will want Britain in the tent pissing out rather than outside pissing in , "" Blyth said ."
2010-05-14,"Hillary Clinton met with a leader from a new government formed in the wake of disputed election results ...
yes , that was yesterday when she met with Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan .
Today , though , she met with William Hague from the rock - solid Lib - Con British coalition government – and they also discussed Afghanistan .
Anyway , according to the transcript of the press conference , Clinton was asked by the BBC :
Q :
Is there any part of you that 's worried about possible fractures in a coalition government , something very unusual in Britain , leading to a lack of solidity in your relationship with Britain and the degree to which you can rely on Britain as a partner ?
A :
Well , as to the first question , the answer is no .
I have absolutely no concerns whatsoever .
We do n't formally have a coalition government in the way that you have formed one in the UK now , but we have enough of our own internal differences that we have to sort through .
So I see nothing at all unusual about this new government .
And from our perspective , it is off to a very strong start .
And certainly on the foreign - policy front , which I follow very closely , obviously , we are extremely pleased .
And this meeting and discussion just confirms our close partnership and our commitment to working together .
That 's cleared that up .
Otherwise not much happened , as is usually the case in these meeting , no matter who 's in power ."
2010-05-20,"Militant Afghan leaders are meeting for peace talks on a luxury holiday island in the Maldives , it has been revealed .
Seven Taliban leaders and 14 members of the Afghan government , none of them identified , were at the talks , a spokesman for the Maldives government said .
Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , confirmed that talks were taking place but a spokesman denied his government had sent representatives .
"" We know something is going on in the Maldives , but we are not informed of the details nor are we involved in the process , "" Waheed Omar said .
"" We do not have any representation and we do not think it will be very helpful for the peace process of Afghanistan . ""
Matt Waldman , a Harvard Taliban specialist , said : "" I would be surprised if this was anything substantive .
What we have seen over the last few years is a number of exploratory contacts with individuals who are associated with insurgent groups . ""
Another Afghan official said the meeting involved the leadership of Hizb - i - Islami , an insurgent group led by former prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
Representatives of Hekmatyar , who is blacklisted by the US and the United Nations as an international terrorist , held talks in the Maldives in January .
In March , a delegation of Hizb - i - Islami met Karzai in Kabul in their first public face - to - face talks .
They reached no deal but promised to continue talking .
A Hizb - i - Islami leader described the Maldives talks as involving former Taliban and said his group were only there as observers.""Officially , Hizb - i - Islami is not involved in this , but we have unofficial representatives there , "" Qaribul Rahman Sayad said .
The Afghan government official said it had sent no representatives to the talks because it wanted all such conversations to happen through a peace conference planned in the capital later this month .
Hizb - i - Islami is far smaller than the Taliban , but is active in at least four provinces of eastern Afghanistan and parts of the north ."
2010-05-22,"Government policy on Afghanistan was thrown into confusion yesterday as three Tory cabinet ministers issued contradictory messages about the UK 's objectives ahead of a meeting with President Hamid Karzai in Kabul .
Former military chiefs urged ministers to clarify their approach as a matter of urgency after Liam Fox , the defence secretary , said he wanted troops out "" as soon as possible "" and insisted that British soldiers were not there "" for the sake of the education policy in a broken 13th- century country "" .
In an interview with the Times , he added : "" We are there so the people of Britain and our global interests are not threatened . ""
His comments appeared to be at odds with remarks by Andrew Mitchell , the international development secretary , and foreign secretary William Hague , whom he accompanied on the trip .
Mitchell insisted it was "" absolutely crucial "" to create a stable society in Afghanistan , with education being a priority . ""
We need to ensure that we help the Afghan people to build a functioning state , "" he said .
"" That 's about providing basic education and healthcare facilities , but it 's also about ensuring there are opportunities for promoting livelihoods so that people have jobs .
"" Reacting to the lack of consistency , Colonel Richard Kemp , former commander of British troops in Afghanistan , said ministers needed to project a coherent strategy if they were to secure Afghan support , crucial if British forces were to achieve their aims in Helmand province : "" It needs to be a unified message , which unfortunately it is not at present . ""
He said reconstruction efforts such as education were vital in wooing the population away from siding with the Taliban and it was important to stress a commitment to withdrawal only after the "" job was done "" .
Fox made clear that he wanted to use the visit to accelerate the departure of the 9,500 UK troops fighting the Taliban as part of the Nato - led mission .
"" We need to accept we are at the limit of numbers now , and I would like the forces to come back as soon as possible , "" he said .
But Hague , who said the mission intended to show "" a properly coherent British approach to Afghanistan "" , emphasised UK commitment .
However , the ministers put on a united front when they appeared before a press conference at the British Embassy in Kabul .
Fox said : "" What I was pointing out , and I welcome the opportunity to amplify it , is that the primary reason for sending our armed forces to Afghanistan was one of national security .
And that has to be the reasons against which we ever deploy our armed forces .
But clearly , if we are to make the long - term gains that will provide the stability to maintain the momentum when our armed forces eventually hand over to the forces of the Afghans , we will require a long period of development in concert with the international authorities , the NGOs , and our and other countries ' aid programmes . ""
Mitchell added : "" Liam Fox does demonstrate that you ca n't get a cigarette paper between his views and mine on the importance of joining together better and more effectively defence , diplomacy and development . ""
Hague said there was no plan to establish a schedule for pulling troops out .
"" There is n't going to be an arbitrary or artificial timetable . ""
David Cameron said during the election campaign that he would not set an artificial deadline for withdrawing troops , but made clear they should start coming home in the next five years .
The UK contingent is part of a US - dominated force expected to grow to about 140,000 at its height in a few weeks .
The ministers ' visit follows a change in Nato 's command structure in southern Afghanistan .
Almost all British troops will now answer to a US commander ."
2010-05-23,"President Hamid Karzai 's attempt to kickstart a peace process with the Taliban in Afghanistan has been delayed again by angry MPs who have threatened to boycott a national gathering intended to establish the ground rules for talks .
The "" peace jirga "" of representatives from around the country had been due to convene in Kabul on 2 May , but was postponed while Karzai made a high profile trip to Washington .
It had been rescheduled for this Saturday , but government and diplomatic sources say it has been delayed once again after parliament flexed its muscles over the president 's failure to send cabinet nominees for the approval of MPs .
More than six months after Karzai was reappointed president after fraud - tainted elections last year , parliament is still waiting to question 11 cabinet nominees .
An official spokesman for the jirga said that although the meeting of around 1,400 people had not yet been "" officially "" postponed , it had been hit by "" technical difficulties "" .
MPs rejected many of Karzai 's initial cabinet selections earlier this year , including some leading warlords , frustrating his ability to reward supporting factions .
He has shown little desire to put forward new names , but 50 MPs have vowed to boycott the peace council unless he does .
Today , two dozen MPs were lounging around on the carpeted steps of parliament reading newspapers , part of a separate strike over Kuchi nomads infringing on the lands of the Hazara community .
The peace jirga is being touted as one of the critical political events of the coming year .
But privately many diplomats say it is likely to be a non - event , during which the delegates will struggle to agree on the hugely controversial issues involved , such as whether the Taliban should be invited to share power or whether the constitution should be amended .
Afghan politicians have also criticised the event for not being truly representative .
"" They are hand - picked by governors who were picked by the president .
These representatives will simply say yes to whatever [ Karzai ] wants , "" said Fauzia Kufi , an MP from northern Afghanistan .
Western diplomats who have seen the list of 360 tribal leaders invited to represent the districts say there is a strong Karzai bias .
One source said much of the delegation from the critical province of Kandahar will be led by Karzai 's half brother and most members were on the president 's re - election campaign team ."
2010-05-24,"Hamid Karzai today ordered a crackdown on private airlines in Afghanistan in the wake of last week 's crash in which 44 people , including three Britons , died .
The Afghan president said no more licences to operate would be issued to commercial airlines and any planes found to be below international standards would be grounded .
His announcement comes amid growing concern over flight safety in the country , highlighted by the crash of the ageing Antonov-24 turboprop operated by an Afghan firm called Pamir Airways .
More than a week later , the government says it has only been able to recover body parts from the wreckage found in the mountains north of Kabul .
But foreign civil aviation experts warned that Afghanistan 's air safety regime is so weak and its ministry of transport so mired in corruption that more accidents are inevitable .
Many Afghans and aid workers have no choice but to use the private carriers because nearly all key roads are controlled by the Taliban .
A foreign air official , who has worked in Afghanistan but did not want to be named , said he predicted this month 's disaster .
"" It is most likely that there are even more to come , "" he said .
Another said Afghanistan had no capacity for ensuring the safety of flights and that the "" deeply flawed system "" was a "" free for all with corruption , incompetence and lack of resources "" .
One foreign pilot working in the country said he only trusted flights operated by Nato or foreign governments , saying the quality of Afghan air controllers at some of the provincial airstrips was suspect .
He claimed Bost airfield – which serves the provincial capital of Helmand – lacked basic safety equipment , had no radar system , and that the two air controllers had no formal training other than "" a day 's orientation on correct radio procedure "" .
The pilot added that a Boeing 737 had regularly landed on the strip , even though the runway is technically too short .
Despite the lack of regulation , international support for improving safety standards has been cut .
An oversight project , formerly run by the International Civil Aviation Organisation , a UN agency , ended last month because of lack of funds .
Another project to improve standards at Kabul airport has also run out of money .
One person involved in one of the projects said with no ability to monitor safety standards the "" number of accidents and fatalities is so high that it is not even recorded or investigated appropriately "" ."
2010-05-25,"The Red Cross in Afghanistan has been teaching the Taliban basic first aid and giving insurgents medical equipment so that fighters wounded during battles with Nato and Afghan government forces can be treated in the field , it was revealed today .
More than 70 members of the "" armed opposition "" received training in April , the Red Cross said – a move likely to anger the government of Hamid Karzai , which is losing large numbers of police and soldiers in insurgent attacks .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said it had introduced the classes because pitched battles , landmines and roadblocks stopped people in the most volatile areas from getting to hospital .
The Red Cross , which aims to remain neutral in the conflict , has trained more than 100 Afghan soldiers and policemen , as well as a network of taxi drivers who operate an unofficial ambulance service in Helmand and Kandahar provinces .
Today , a leading figure in Kandahar 's local government , who wanted to remain anonymous , said the Taliban did "" not deserve to be treated like humans "" .
He said : "" They are like animals , and they treat the people they capture worse than animals .
They kidnapped and killed an American lady and then would n't even return her body .
These people do n't deserve this help . ""
The Afghan ministries of defence and the interior said they were unable to comment on what they described as a highly controversial issue .
A Nato spokesman in Kabul said : "" Nato has tremendous respect for the humanitarian work carried out by the ICRC and we recognise the need for this work to be carried out impartially . ""
Isaf [ Nato ] forces also provide treatment to any case caught up in this conflict , including our opponents , in line with our own obligation to respect the rules of armed conflict .
"" One of the ICRC - trained drivers , who transports sick and wounded people from Sangin district in Helmand , where some of the most fierce fighting is taking place , to Mirwais hospital in Kandahar city , told the ICRC that roadblocks and insecurity had lengthened the journey to six or seven hours , rather than the normal two .
The extraordinary measure highlights how badly security has declined in southern Afghanistan , undermining this summer 's effort by US - led forces to protect the population from violence .
The ICRC said its volunteers in Kandahar and staff at Mirwais hospital had seen a "" substantial increase "" in the number of patients injured by improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) and other weapons .
Critics of the Nato push in southern Afghanistan , which is aimed at seizing full control of Kandahar city and central Helmand from the Taliban by the end of the year , said that coalition commanders had made the situation worse by publicising where they were going to launch assaults .
By discussing publicly their plans in February for clearing the largely rural area of Marja in Helmand and then their desire to "" clear "" districts surrounding Kandahar city , Nato hoped many insurgents would simply choose not to fight .
But in many cases , the move gave the Taliban time to dig in and plant IEDS in the areas .
For years the beds at Mirwais hospital have been regularly filled with men with gunshot wounds , many of whom are insurgents .
But ICRC staff , who support the work of the hospital , have learned not to ask questions about how they sustained their injuries .
In general the government has been happy to allow fighters to come to the hospital , receive treatment and leave again .
But in Helmand in April , the tacit approval for such humanitarian medical support appeared to break down when Afghan security services raided a hospital in Lashkar Gah , the provincial capital , run by an Italian NGO called Emergency , which also has a strict policy of providing surgical help to anyone who needs it .
Nine staff were arrested and accused of plotting to murder the provincial governor after weapons and suicide bomb vests were found in the compound .
The International Committee of the Red Cross runs hospitals in Afghanistan , visits prisoners on both sides of the conflict and co - operates on various projects with the Afghan Red Crescent Society , a separate organisation , on various projects ."
2010-05-29,"A series of protests against the Iranian government took place recently in various cities in Afghanistan , making headlines and threatening to damage diplomatic relations between Kabul and Tehran .
Judging by the banners and protesters ' comments , the gatherings were in response to the hanging of Afghan citizens , arrested and imprisoned in Iran for drug smuggling .
The Afghan leader , Hamid Karzai , disagreed with the protests .
He told a press conference : "" In my view , protesting against a country that is friendly and fraternal is wrong . ""
The president 's concern makes sense , given that Kabul has been trying to consolidate its relations with Tehran in an attempt to counterbalance Afghanistan 's heavy reliance on the United States with new regional partners .
But since the Afghan constitution grants citizens freedom of protest , Kabul had little choice but to tolerate them .
The protests , which were widely reported on the ground in Afghanistan , had some eye - catching features .
The slogans were supranational in character , demanding justice not only for the hanged Afghans but also for a group of Kurdish political activists , among them a woman .
But the call for solidarity beyond national borders did not stop there .
Protesters made a public show of their solidarity with the Iranian opposition movement , carrying posters of Neda Agha Soltan , the young woman whose killing triggered international outrage against Tehran .
A banner prominently carried in front of the rally said "" Death to Oppression – in Kabul or Tehran "" .
To untrained eyes , the hallmarks of a new progressive movement were all there .
Women , men and even schoolboys were marching alongside each other , condemning political oppression , demanding justice regardless of gender , ethnicity or even the category of crime that had led to imprisonment to begin with .
They were curious protests , creating the impression that a reformist movement similar to the one in Iran was emerging in Afghanistan .
The party that had officially organised the protests was , appropriately , named the Afghanistan Solidarity party .
A well - organised , grassroots movement seemed to have emerged in Afghanistan .
But an objective assessment of the protests told a different story .
In spite of their humanitarian message , the protests used means associated with rallies that have the potential to trigger violence .
Effigies of Iranian officials were set on fire , and the phrase "" death to "" was not only shouted but was displayed on banners in large letters .
This type of aggressive slogan is a hangover from the radical politics of the 1970s and 1980s , and has little room in progressive political movements of the 21st century .
Then there was the conspicuous presence of uniformed schoolboys , who in Afghanistan have a reputation for attending any protest as long as they are offered pocket money .
Their marching alongside adults somewhat undermined the authenticity of the protests in a country where such dubious means of increasing rally numbers are well known .
Was this really a new , authentic and progressive grassroots movement ?
Afghan politics is rarely what it appears to be on the surface .
Digging deeper into such seemingly new political movements , what usually resurfaces is old political rivalries – and even older ideologues who reinvent themselves in tune with the demands of time .
The recent anti - Iranian protests were no exception .
Research into the organising party reveals that its leader is a seasoned political player , with a background in the Maoist Afghan political party established in 1968 .
The party 's subsequent history mirrors that of its Islamist counterparts .
Conflict set in soon after the party 's establishment , creating splinter groups that operated clandestinely , often in exile .
A number of important leaders were then killed under mysterious circumstances , and the true cause of their deaths was never revealed .
The fog of war offered plenty of opportunities to blame the deaths on political rivals , Islamists led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , or foreign intelligence services , the ISI , the KGB or the CIA .
It was this murky world of politics in exile and on the ground that created the widespread paranoia in Afghanistan , a prism through which most Afghans today tend to interpret reality .
The leader behind the scenes also has a reputation among people familiar with his history and political circle for harbouring strong sentiments against Iran .
And so , what seemed a new and exciting Afghan grassroots movement turned out to be an extension of an old activist 's personal feelings of resentment towards Iran .
Afghans were briefly given the illusion that there was something new , and perhaps hopeful , on the horizon .
But as it turned out , the protests were simply a confirmation of the old adage that everything must change so that everything can remain the same ."
2010-06-02,"The Taliban deployed suicide bombers and rockets to attack a major meeting of Afghan leaders today , moments after President Hamid Karzai launched his plans for making peace with the insurgents .
The three - day "" Peace Jirga "" had just begun with a speech by the Afghan president when the first rocket exploded somewhere near the compound that houses the country 's loya jirga tent – a large white marquee used for important national meetings .
Nearby , security officials exchanged fire with insurgents before a suicide bomber detonated explosives , killing himself .
There were no reports of other casualties .
Karzai , who had just been recalling how senior members of the Taliban regime had crossed to the government 's side soon after the US - led invasion of 2001 , laughed off the incident . ""
Sit down , nothing will happen , "" Karzai told the 1,600 delegates , some of whom left their seats to try to see what was going on .
"" I have become used to this , "" said the president , who has survived a number of assassination attempts , before continuing with a speech where he promised to continue to pressurise US - led forces to reduce civilian casualties and bring an end to unpopular night raids .
Another explosion was heard from an apparent rocket attack that landed close to the venue .
Soon after finishing his speech , Karzai left the tent in a convoy of armoured vehicles as helicopters hovered overhead .
Small arms fire could still be heard an hour after the first attack .
The Taliban , who have successfully deterred some delegates from the country 's most insecure areas from attending , claimed responsibility for the attack saying the suicide bombers had been dressed as members of the Afghan security forces – a tactic used many times in the past .
An Interior Ministry spokesman said the police and army had surrounded a building near to the perimeter of the Loya Jirga tent where he said some militants were based .
Despite the disruption one of the diplomats in the tent to observe the opening of the event said that there was only "" mild apprehension "" among the delegates .
"" There was just a mild flutter in one quarter but in general people are pretty used to this kind of thing , "" said George Noel - Clarke , an EU political officer in Kabul .
"" The Taliban are clearly trying to embarrass him but he dealt with it quite well . ""
The jirga , hailed by western leaders as a critical first step to peace was dismissed yesterday as a "" PR exercise "" by the leader of the country 's opposition , who said he would not attend the event .
Abdullah Abdullah – who won millions of votes and came second in last year 's presidential elections – said the way delegates had been selected by government officials meant they did not represent all Afghan opinion : "" Had it been a national jirga and a national effort we would have supported that effort . ""
He said the event "" seemed like a PR exercise to show that we are making an effort to reach peace in this country "" .
Huge amounts of effort went into organising the three - day conference which is being held in the same cavernous marquee that was used for the 2002 loya jirga that agreed Afghanistan 's post - Taliban constitution .
The National Consultative Peace Jirga will be asked to consider an ambitious government proposal to offer jobs and other economic incentives to Taliban foot soldiers who agree to stop fighting .
Such schemes are unlikely to be too controversial .
Far more divisive , however , will be how future negotiations with the Taliban should be handled and what , if anything , should be offered to insurgent leaders in return for peace .
Foreign officials say a broad national consensus is essential to avoid the perception that any peace deal is , in the words of one western diplomat , a "" Pashtun to Pashtun stitch - up "" .
The 1,600 delegates include some 550 women , the number of which were increased after Hillary Clinton expressed concerns to Karzai that women risked being overlooked ."
2010-06-02,"The national consultative peace jirga had hardly got going in Kabul yesterday when it was interrupted by the nearby impact of rockets , gunfire and three suicide bombers detonating their belts .
President Hamid Karzai called the Taliban "" brothers "" and "" dear Talibs "" in his speech to the assembly , but the feeling , evidently , was not mutual .
Mr Karzai acknowledged their fighting was a reaction to injustices done by local Afghans who had "" disturbed them "" and by foreign troops .
What was missing in this analysis was his government 's role in inflaming the insurgency .
Why would even the middle - ranking Taliban accept money to reintegrate into Afghan society from the very people whose misdeeds had caused them to fight ?
The answer to this is the sort of fix Mr Karzai 's foreign backers have got used to : avoid the most egregiously corrupt governors by distributing the money locally , through community heads .
In other words , Afghan governance is to be improved only by circumventing key parts of the Afghan government .
The military campaign is tying itself in similar knots .
The British commander of Nato forces in southern Afghanistan , Major General Nick Carter , can insist as loudly as he likes that command is blind to nationality .
The fact is that for the second time in recent memory , an American force has taken over command from a British one that has bitten off more than it can chew .
The parallels with Basra 's painful memories are real .
In both cases , a British force went in undermanned , underequipped , and blithely underinformed .
In both theatres of war , British troops fanned out into the hinterland , only to find themselves pinned back in their bases .
In Helmand there was no fighting before the British troops were deployed four years ago .
Today parts of the province are recovering , such as the capital Lashkar Gah .
But areas like Marjah and Sangin remain bitterly contested .
Greater numbers of US troops are encountering much the same difficulties .
In the Nad Ali area , there are not enough US or Afghan forces to command the loyalty of local villagers .
The Afghan government has not sent enough administrators or police to establish a government .
So much for the promise that General Stanley McChrystal made to unpack government from a box .
Three months later , he has grown impatient with the operation .
The Marjah campaign , which was designed as a blueprint for how the Taliban could be rolled back , has become – in Gen McChrystal 's words – a bleeding ulcer of the campaign .
There could be bigger wounds yet .
The forthcoming operation in Kandahar will not be a battle , we are told .
More of a process .
But whether troops arrive in this big central Asian city by helicopter or by taxi , the shooting will start , and when it does another major conflagration will have been sparked , another battlefield demarcated .
The new government of David Cameron has an opportunity to take fresh stock .
It could decide to simply go with the flow , in the knowledge that US and British troops will be fighting in Afghanistan for years to come .
Barack Obama 's promise to time - limit his surge has already been shelved .
July 2011 is not now the date when US troops will start to be withdrawn .
It has become instead the high watermark of the troop surge .
Which is a different thing .
Much will be made of the fact that some provinces will be returned to the control of the Afghan national army .
Pashtuns from the south still only make up around 3 % of this army , so that , in the areas that have become the cockpit of this war , there is no possibility of US and British troops handing over control to local forces , unless they are Taliban ones .
Or this government could make a bold decision – to withdraw troops from the front , use them to secure Kabul and set themselves the more modest aim of doing the things that work .
Not fighting wars they can never win , but training Afghans to help themselves ."
2010-06-04,"Delegates at Afghanistan 's peace jirga brought the three - day gathering to a close today with calls for ceasefires and prisoner releases , and for the Afghan government and insurgents to start talking to each other .
Other suggestions , made by 26 working groups representing 1,600 delegates from around the country , included a ban on "" un - Islamic "" television programmes , the removal of senior insurgents from "" blacklists "" kept by the US and the United Nations , and the demand that the Taliban cut ties with al - Qaida .
But with the recommendations carrying no legal weight , Hamid Karzai 's government will be able to decide which ones will be enacted .
The final resolution merely said that the government would "" establish a framework for negotiations with those who are dissatisfied with the government "" .
Despite the wide range of suggestions , Karzai told delegates that there was now a clear direction for peace talks . ""
Now the path is clear , the path that has been shown and chosen by you , we will go on that step by step and this path will , God willing , take us to our destination , "" he said .
The working groups spent much of the day announcing their proposals .
The majority of them said talks between the Taliban and the government sides were essential .
Others said that insurgents who come over to the side of the government should be given legal amnesty .
Karzai 's hopes that the meeting would give him a national mandate to start a peace process were dented by the fact that most of Afghanistan 's legal opposition chose to stay away .
Abdullah Abdullah , the politician who polled second in the first round of last year 's presidential election , said he would not attend because the delegates had been handpicked by the government and were not representative of the country .
Abdul Rashid Dostum , the powerful Uzbek warlord from northern Afghanistan , also stayed away , as did Haji Mohammad Mohaqeq , a leader of the Hazara community .
All three men were associated with groups that fought against the Taliban in the 1990s .
There was also anger that organisers broke a promise for delegates to elect a chairman and instead simply appointed Burhanuddin Rabbani , a Tajik leader and former president .
Observers said that while some working groups engaged in lively debates about the issues , others drifted away on the second day or simply stayed in their rooms .
Active insurgents were not invited , and the Taliban made clear its disdain for the gathering both in published statements and also by attacking the jirga on its opening day with rocket propelled grenades and militants wearing suicide bomb vests ."
2010-06-06,"Two of the most internationally respected members of Hamid Karzai 's government resigned today over security breaches at last week 's "" peace jirga "" that allowed the gathering of 1,600 national leaders to come under Taliban rocket attack .
The resignation of Hanif Atmar , the British university educated interior minister , and spy chief Amrullah Saleh will be regarded as a huge setback for foreign - backed efforts to improve security and to reform the corrupt , barely literate and largely untrained police force .
A western security expert who has worked closely with both men said the double resignation was a "" disaster "" and ensured that the international mission in Afghanistan "" was now doomed further "" .
He said : "" These are two of the most important people in the security sector who were finally getting a better reputation for their organs and clearing up corruption within them .
If they are replaced by corrupt cronies then we might as well all pack up and go home now . ""
The resignations also prompted speculation in Kabul that Karzai had seized the opportunity to get rid of two men he had lost trust in , despite the strong support they had from foreign embassies .
Saleh was especially valued as a seasoned intelligence officer who , even before being appointed to head the National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) , had forged close links with the CIA and MI6 when he was a key aide to Ahmed Shah Massoud , the legendary anti - Taliban resistance leader . ""
The significance of their removal is very profound and speaks volumes about the growing paranoia in the palace about the loyalties of those who have been central to the Karzai administration for the last several years , "" said Candace Rondeaux , senior Afghanistan analyst at the International Crisis Group .
Foreign diplomats and palace insiders all say the relationship between Karzai and the two men has been stormy for some time , with the Afghan president subjecting them to ferocious tongue lashings , prompting Atmar to offer his resignation earlier this year .
Saleh told friends that he had been considering resignation after feeling he had lost Karzai 's support . ""
This was the final slap in the face for the international community , "" said one former senior Afghan diplomat .
"" It was their way of telling the Americans they can no longer protect Amrullah and it was their way of telling the British that they could longer protect Atmar . ""
The passing of Saleh , who has publicly accused the Pakistani intelligence service of being responsible for numerous Taliban attacks inside the country , is likely to delight Pakistan , which had promised better relations if he was removed .
But a palace official insisted that the resignations simply reflected a "" major security breach and lack of preparation "" at an event called to discuss plans for a peace process with the Taliban .
"" If the rockets had landed a few metres in a different direction then we would have had 1,600 people dead in the tent , "" the official said .
The Karzai aide also said that Atmar and Saleh explained themselves to a cabinet security committee today but their account was found to be "" divergent from reality "" .
Today the interior ministry gave more details of how the attackers managed to penetrate a security perimeter manned by 12,000 security guards .
A spokesman said two of the attackers disguised themselves as a couple , with one wearing a burqa .
A grenade launcher and an AK-47 rifle were wrapped in cloth and made to look like a swaddled child , the ministry said ."
2010-06-09,"President Hamid Karzai has lost faith in the US strategy in Afghanistan and is increasingly looking to Pakistan to end the insurgency , according to those close to Afghanistan 's former head of intelligence services .
Amrullah Saleh , who resigned last weekend , believes the president lost confidence some time ago in the ability of Nato forces to defeat the Taliban .
As head of the National Directorate of Security , Saleh was highly regarded in western circles .
He has said little about why he quit , other than that the Taliban attack on last week 's peace jirga or assembly in Kabul was for him the "" tipping point "" ; the interior minister , Hanif Atmar , also quit , and their resignations were accepted by Karzai .
Privately Saleh has told aides he believes Karzai 's approach is dangerously out of step with the strategy of his western backers . ""
There came a time when [ Karzai ] lost his confidence in the capability of the coalition or even his own government [ to protect ] this country , "" a key aide told the Guardian .
Saleh believes Karzai has long thought this , but his views were crystallised in the aftermath of last year 's election when millions of votes were found to be fraudulent ; Karzai blamed the US , UK and United Nations for the fraud .
According to the source , Saleh is deeply concerned by Karzai 's noticeably softer attitude towards Pakistan .
The president has long dropped his past habit of excoriating Pakistan for aiding the Taliban .
Saleh also echoes complaints of US commanders that Karzai refuses to behave like a commander - in - chief , and is not publicly leading the counterinsurgency campaign devised by Stanley McChrystal , the US commander of Nato forces .
In London today , the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , warned that progress needed to be made .
"" In all coalition countries the public expects to see us move in the right direction [ but ] will not tolerate the perception of a stalemate , where we are losing our young men . ""
Gates also warned of "" a high level of violence , especially this summer "" , as US forces push deeper into southern provinces where the Taliban are strongest .
Today in the south , insurgents shot down a Nato helicopter , killing four US troops , while a British soldier died in a separate attack .
In Islamabad in Pakistan , an assault on a depot by insurgents destroyed 50 lorries belonging to the Nato military supply chain .
Saleh 's resignation on Sunday , along with Atmar , was a huge blow to the government , which is otherwise largely lacking in high - calibre senior officials .
He was strongly supported by the CIA and MI6 , and had a reputation as hardworking and honest .
His six years at the head of what is probably Afghanistan 's least dysfunctional state body gave him extensive access to Karzai , a man he still regards as a "" patriot "" and whom he is reluctant to publicly criticise .
But , according to Saleh 's aides , the final straw came last Sunday when Karzai apparently questioned his loyalty during a stormy meeting at the presidential palace , appearing not to believe Saleh and Atmar 's account of how two insurgents armed with rocket launchers , one dressed as a woman , were able to get so close to a meeting of 1,600 national leaders .
Saleh 's colleagues say that Karzai even accused the two men of a plot with the Americans and the British to wreck his peace plan .
Saleh 's friends say that , because Karzai believes Nato is unable to deal with insurgent sanctuaries on the eastern border , he is looking for an alternative strategy : rather than use western support to "" harden "" Afghanistan against its neighbour , he is instead striking a less robust attitude to Pakistan and the Taliban .
The former intelligence head is outraged by the tone of the jirga , which stressed the role of the weak and corrupt Afghan state in fomenting insurgency .
And he was appalled by Karzai 's post - jirga announcement that a commission would be set up to release Taliban prisoners not held on solid evidence – such evidence in many cases came from Saleh 's directorate .
But Karzai is not alone .
McChrystal and diplomats have for months argued that Pakistan is rethinking its support for the Taliban after deadly attacks on Pakistani cities , and say arrests of Taliban commanders , such as Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in February , are proof of the new mood in Pakistan – something Saleh disputes .
Casualties rise
There has been an increase in violence in Afghanistan as US commanders put the final touches to a plan to secure the Taliban 's southern heartland of Kandahar , an operation they hope will turn the tide of the war .
The latest casualties yesterday took Nato 's toll to 29 deaths in nine days , according to an AP count .
The United States , whose some 94,000 troops vastly outnumber the rest of the allies ' contributions in Afghanistan , has lost 17 service members since Sunday .
The downing of an American Blackhawk helicopter in Helmand province saw four American crew die , but a couple of wounded British soldiers being carried on board survived and were transferred to another Blackhawk .
Their injuries are said to be not life - threatening .
Helmand provincial spokesman Daoud Ahmadi said the helicopter was shot down about midday in Sangin district during an operation involving Nato and Afghan security forces .
Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said the insurgents shot off two rockets to down the helicopter .

2010-06-10,"Poor old David Cameron .
He flies into Kabul ready to promise all kinds of assistance for the Afghan police , army and governance , trumpeting the importance of "" the national security approach "" .
Unfortunately , he arrives just at a point when Afghanistan 's national security strategy itself may be crumbling into disarray .
The resignation of interior minister Hanif Atmar and the head of Afghanistan 's intelligence agency , the National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) , Amrullah Saleh , risks creating a period of instability that threatens British policy here as well as that of other western allies .
Atmar and Saleh 's failure to prevent the rocket and suicide bomber attack on last week 's peace jirga – although none of the 1,600 delegates were injured – was held up as the reason for their forced resignations , but the rift goes much deeper than that .
Both men were staunch opponents of opening peace talks with the Taliban and both have had significant fallings - out with Karzai in the past .
Saleh , in particular , was concerned at Karzai 's softening attitude towards Pakistan .
In an interview last night on Afghan TV , Saleh made it clear he held Pakistan responsible for much of the Taliban insurgency .
Karzai 's overtures towards Pakistan are proving unpopular with both the public and within government , viewed as an eccentric move especially at a time when western support for Pakistan is shifting and its role in the Afghan insurgency facing closer scrutiny .
One rumour here is that Saleh 's removal was a Pakistani condition for directing the Taliban into peace talks .
Another is that the president 's latest decision to set up a commission to review the cases of Taliban prisoners held without sufficient evidence may have been the last straw .
Whatever the truth , the departure of these two men , both highly respected by Afghanistan 's western allies , leaves a power vacuum in two of the most crucial areas for Afghanistan 's stability .
And this void wo n't be an easy one to fill , not least because the term of parliament expires next Monday , followed by the start of the campaign season and the departure of most candidates to the provinces .
Parliament will only sit again following the elections due on 20 September .
Kabul is now braced for further attacks with militants expected to exploit the confusion in the wake of the resignations , not to mention the already floundering fight against organised crime and corruption .
The NDS is one of the few institutions that is not only functioning but also a model for other government bodies , says political analyst Haroun Mir .
"" If we have an incompetent director the whole institution could unravel within months and we would face a disaster . "" A summer of potential violence also risks serious effects on Barack Obama 's intention to begin a US withdrawal next year , a plan that relies on strengthening the capacity of Afghan forces – in particular , the police .
In one fell swoop , it seems , Karzai has managed to get rid of two of his most able lieutenants , imperil the country 's security strategy and drive a wedge between himself and his western backers .
It does n't appear too rational .
But some here say that Karzai has long gone beyond sound judgment .
"" I think Karzai is in survival mode , "" says Mir .
"" He is all about tactics and no longer has any strategy , otherwise he would be behaving differently .
He feels he is being attacked from all sides and that there is a conspiracy against him , both from the west and within his own country . ""
It seems that Cameron is only the latest in a long line of western leaders to have stood shoulder - to - shoulder with Karzai , making pledges of unity and support through slightly clenched teeth ."
2010-06-10,"David Cameron today flew into Kabul amid tight security on a military aircraft in his first visit to Afghanistan since moving in to Downing Street a month ago .
The prime minister , who will hold talks this morning in Kabul with Hamid Karzai , the president , choose Afghanistan for his first visit outside Europe to show that it will be his government 's top foreign policy priority .
Elaborate security precautions were put in place for the trip , which comes just over a week after insurgents launched a rocket attack on a nationwide peace jirga – or council – in Kabul .
The rockets exploded near the jirga tent as Karzai invited the Taliban to follow a peaceful path .
A news blackout was imposed until this morning on today 's trip , which started when Cameron left the Commons yesterday after prime minister 's questions for a civilian flight to Abu Dhabi .
The prime minister , accompanied by his new national security adviser , Sir Peter Ricketts , and other senior No 10 officials , was picked up in the Gulf by an RAF C130 Hercules aircraft for a four - hour flight to Kabul .
The prime minister was given body armour for the flight and the Hercules is equipped with flares to deter an attack .
It also lands in a sharp "" corkscrew "" manoeuvre to make it more difficult to target .
Cameron wants to use today 's trip to show four groups that Afghanistan will be his top foreign policy priority .
The groups are : the 9,500 British troops in Afghanistan , most of whom are fighting the Taliban in the south in Helmand province ; British voters , many of whom have told opinion pollsters that they can not understand why Britain is still committed to Afghanistan ; Karzai ; and Barack Obama , who will receive the prime minister at the White House next month .
On his first full day in office as prime minister last month , Cameron convened a meeting of his new national security council .
The prime minister received Karzai at Chequers during his first weekend in office .
The two men have spoken on the phone since .
Cameron will today offer important support for Karzai , who is regarded warily in Washington for failing to do enough to tackle corruption .
Karzai alarmed many western capitals on Sunday when he sacked two highly regarded security officials , ostensibly for failing to prevent the attack on the peace council .
Amrullah Saleh , the head of Afghanistan 's intelligence agency , and Hanif Atmar , the interior minister , had both served Karzai since he became president in 2002 .
Saleh was understood to be uncomfortable with a key concession from Karzai as he reaches out to elements of the Taliban .
This is to release Taliban prisoners who faced evidence that is too weak to convict them .
While Britain shares some of the concerns about Karzai , it supports the attempts to wean members of the Taliban off the path of violence .
They have to renounce violence and accept the Afghan constitution to be allowed a role in mainstream politics .
British officials stress that the Afghan government is in the lead on this .
Cameron is keen to adopt a fresh approach to Afghanistan after the last government was damaged by persistent reports that it had failed to equip British troops properly when the decision was taken to deploy to southern Afghanistan in 2006 .
In all , 294 British servicemen and women have died in Afghanistan since Britain deployed there in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
Lance Bombardier Mark Chandler , 32 , of 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery , became the 294th victim yesterday when he was killed in Helmand during a gun battle with insurgents in the province 's Nad - e Ali district .
The prime minister came into office believing there were two broad ways in which he could improve on Labour 's record .
These are to ensure : •
Troops are properly equipped .
It is understood that the military told the prime minister in his first days in office that problems of equipment – kit and helicopters – were solved long before Labour left office .
•
Better coordination between the military , civilian and development sides of British involvement in Afghanistan as the emphasis is placed on stabilising the country rather than creating a perfect society .
Three senior members of the national security council – foreign secretary William Hague , defence secretary Liam Fox , and international development Andrew Mitchell – demonstrated this approach by travelling to Afghanistan together last month .
But Cameron may have to show some humility today after Fox ran into trouble for using pejorative language about Afghanistan to illustrate the government 's belief that stability comes first .
Fox said British troops were not in Afghanistan "" for the sake of the education policy in a broken 13th century country "" .
The new government acknowledges it is working within a broader strategy established by Obama in his speech at the West Point Military Academy last December .
This is to send in an extra 30,000 troops this year for a surge that will start to draw down next year .
Sources talk of inheriting a strategy which Britain will help to shape from now until the run - up to a Nato summit in November .
This will take place a month before a review by Obama .
Officials say there are three priorities for Britain : • Encourage Karzai as he develops his political strategy , symbolised by the peace jirga , to achieve a semblance of national unity by trying to persuade some elements of the Taliban to enter the mainstream .
•
Intensify the training of Afghan security forces , particularly the army , so they will be able to take greater charge as the surge is drawn down .
•
Ensure that Britain 's three contributions – military , development and civilian – work together more effectively ."
2010-06-26,"World leaders issued a stark warning yesterday to the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , demanding detailed plans of how he will take over responsibility for the country 's security and drive out corruption within five years .
The message from the G8 leaders , who are gathered in Canada , will be seen as setting a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops .
It will also be seen as a vindication for David Cameron , who said yesterday that he hoped British soldiers would be out of the country in the same time period .
But the message is likely to trigger controversy , as many warn that Afghanistan is far from stable .
Nick Harvey , the armed forces minister , said yesterday that there would be no withdrawal before ministers were satisfied that the country would not "" slip back into being a haven for international terrorism "" .
One of the country 's foremost experts warned that Afghanistan is edging towards the "" horrendous "" scenario of civil war and that its population increasingly believes international forces are losing the battle with the Taliban .
In an interview with the Observer , Michael Semple , the former head of the EU mission in Afghanistan , said that the security situation was unravelling to a point where the country could implode into civil chaos .
Semple – who is said to retain extensive high - level contacts within the Taliban and advises several government agencies working in Afghanistan – added that last week 's dismissal of Nato 's top commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , could further undermine trust among the Afghan people in the coalition .
"" There is a widespread perception [ in Afghanistan ] that Nato is not winning this , "" he said .
"" A lot of people now expect that the Nato campaign will fail .
They do n't think that Nato will see it through , and the government is not strong enough to continue .
They expect there will be another round of civil war and they are getting ready for that . ""
Semple said talk of withdrawing international forces , including Britain 's 10,000-strong presence in the south , was helping push towards civil war .
Cameron has repeatedly stressed his desire to bring home troops as soon as possible – making his views most clear on Friday when he insisted he wanted them back by the next election .
Yesterday he led discussions on the issue with other G8 leaders , arguing that the time had come for Karzai to prove he could deliver on anti - corruption , electoral reform and good governance .
In a passionate speech , Cameron said he wanted to see the military surge bound together with a political drive .
His views were reiterated in the G8 communique , which said : "" The Kabul conference in July will be an important opportunity for the government of Afghanistan to present its detailed plan and show tangible progress in implementing the commitments made in January 2010 including measures to … make concrete progress to reinforce the formal justice system and expand the capacity of the Afghan national security forces to assume increasing responsibility for security within five years .
"" The prime minister 's apparent eagerness for a full withdrawal is understood to be causing consternation among policymakers in Washington and Kabul , who believe it is sending signals to the Afghan people that UK troops are preparing to go home .
Semple said evidence was emerging on the ground that the country was tilting towards civil war – a situation that has dogged Afghanistan for much of its 300-year history .
Semple , a fellow at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , said there were signs of a three - way jostling for power evolving between pro - Taliban Pashtun , anti - Taliban Pashtun and non - Pashtun groups .
"" The civil war scenario is a horrendous position .
You can already see elements of that at the moment .
The reality is that the Nato campaign is just about keeping a lid on it , but not forever . ""
You handle the drawdown wrongly , you get basically ambushed in Afghan politics and you get this prospect of a civil war , "" said Semple , who as the third - highest - ranking diplomat in the country was expelled by the Afghan government in 2007 for pursuing talks with the Taliban .
Last week Britain 's special envoy to Afghanistan , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , stepped down after clashing with senior Nato and US officials over his insistence that the military - driven counter - insurgency effort was failing .
The veteran diplomat likened the battle in Afghanistan to "" a civil war "" , and said that the need for peace talks with the Taliban was imperative .
Cameron has yet to clarify his views on negotiations with the Taliban , but is said to be increasingly anxious over the number of British troops being killed , and has braced the public for further casualties during the summer "" fighting months "" ahead .
A total of 307 UK servicemen and women have died since operations began in October 2001 , with 18 fatalities so far this month .
Yesterday thousands of Britons turned out across the UK to mark Armed Forces Day and show their support for servicemen and women .
Cameron 's withdrawal strategy remains dependent on accelerating the size and capabilities of the Afghan army .
Although the Ministry of Defence insist that the growth of that force is on track , Semple said that was far from the case .
"" All Afghan army units involved in recent operations alongside Nato have been operating at around about half strength , mainly because of retention issues , "" he said ."
2010-07-01,"A US House of Representatives panel has voted to cut almost $ 4bn ( £ 2.68bn ) in aid to the Afghanistan government after allegations of corruption .
News reports have alleged that large amounts of cash have been flown out of the country , while President Hamid Karzai 's government has blocked corruption investigations of political allies .
The move to withdraw aid came as the US senate voted unanimously to confirm General David Petraeus as commander of the Afghan war , and the UK defence secretary Liam Fox insisted the British army must not leave Afghanistan "" before the job is finished "" .
A subcommittee of the House of Representatives voted yesterday to block $ 3.9bn ( £ 2.6bn ) in aid that the Obama administration sought for Kabul , although the panel 's chair , Nita Lowey , said the aid could be reconsidered once the Afghanistan government 's efforts to fight corruption have been reconsidered .
Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that more than $ 3bn in cash has been flown out of Kabul International airport in the past three years , while The Washington Post alleged that officials in Karzai 's government have been blocking corruption investigations of political allies .
"" The cash – packed into suitcases , piled onto pallets and loaded into aeroplanes – is declared and legal to move , "" the Wall Street Journal said .
"" But US and Afghan officials say they are targeting the flows in major anti - corruption and drug trafficking investigations because of their size relative to Afghanistan 's small economy and the murkiness of their origins . ""
Last year the gross domestic product of Afghanistan was $ 13.5bn , according to the CIA world factbook .
Lowey said she has written to US government auditors asking them to audit all US aid to Afghanistan from the last three years .
The aid withdrawal came as the US senate voted 99 - 0 in favour of appointing Petraeus to command the Afghan war , after the dramatic sacking of the previous commander Stanley McChrystal last week .
However the unanimous support for Petraeus , seen by some as Obama 's last hope in Afghanistan , came amid growing anxiety in among both Democrats and Republicans about an unpopular war , in which casualties are rising , ahead of the November US congressional elections . ""
Regardless of who is in command , the president 's current strategy in Afghanistan is counterproductive , "" said Democrat Senator Russ Feingold after voting for Petraeus – whom he stressed was "" clearly qualified "" for the job .
In the UK , Liam Fox appeared to defy David Cameron 's weekend pledge to withdraw all British troops from Afghanistan by 2015 , saying an early withdrawal of coalition troops from Afghanistan would risk a return of civil war and act as a "" shot in the arm to jihadists "" .
"" Were we to leave prematurely , without degrading the insurgency and increasing the capability of the Afghan national security forces , we could see the return of the destructive forces of transnational terror , "" he said .
"" Not only would we risk the return of civil war in Afghanistan , creating a security vacuum , but we would also risk the destabilisation of Pakistan with potentially unthinkable regional , and possibly nuclear , consequences . ""
Fox said Britain would be betraying the sacrifices of its fallen soldiers if it left "" before the job is finished "" , adding that British forces would be among the last to leave Afghanistan , as they are stationed in Helmand , one the most dangerous provinces in the country ."
2010-07-01,"So the Taliban leadership are loudly announcing that they will not be entering into talks with either Hamid Karzai or any foreign powers until coalition troops withdraw .
The tone of their latest declaration is impressively scornful .
"" We are certain that we are winning , "" announces the statement from a spokesman for the Taliban leadership .
"" Why should we talk if we have the upper hand , and the foreign troops are considering withdrawal , and there are differences in the ranks of our enemies ?
"" It seems clear that the Taliban leadership , ever media - savvy , have taken the opportunity of the Stanley McChrystal debacle to make some point - scoring noise .
Whether there is any substance behind their contemptuous rhetoric is a different matter .
"" I do n't think this statement will change policy in any way , "" says one British diplomat .
"" Of course the Taliban are going to say this publicly .
Does that mean that everyone amongst their ranks thinks this ?
Of course not . ""
And while not claiming any knowledge of the current state of contact with the insurgents , he added : "" It would be wrong to rule out the possibility – or even likelihood .
Quiet contact is a tried - and - tested method in these situations , and especially in Afghanistan , where they have an established tradition of talking to their enemies . ""
So will such triumphant statements increase support for the Taliban locally ?
Some recent acts have suggested an increasing desperation by insurgent forces , such as the brutal lynching of an eight - year - old boy in Helmand after he was accused of spying for the British — or after his father refused to pay hundreds of dollars to a local Taliban leader .
But for the average Afghan , it 's far from a straight choice of preferring the Taliban over the coalition forces .
The biggest problem people have with the foreign troops is that they will keep on killing innocent civilians .
Why ca n't the most powerful army in the world tell the difference between a wedding party and a bunch of fighters with Kalashnikovs , they ask , not unreasonably .
That does n't mean they want them to withdraw and leave them to the none - too tender mercies of the Taliban , or , more likely , another descent into anarchy and factional fighting .
The country is still far from stable , with a lack of good governance , political clout and rampant corruption .
A recent survey showed that 59 % of people felt that corruption was the greatest problem faced by their country , even more so than security or unemployment .
Ask about corruption here and you will be treated to a blistering account of the manoeuvrings of local warlords , businessmen and politicians , tales of multimillion dollar tax exemptions and Dubai mansions gifted for political favours .
Graft counts for around a quarter of the country 's GDP and Afghanistan is the world 's second most corrupt country after Somalia , according to Transparency International . ""
Maybe this is one area where we can look forward to being top of the league , "" one businessman friend told me with a bitter laugh .
The problem only seems to be getting worse .
Almost $ 4bn ( £ 2.7bn ) of US aid to Afghanistan was blocked this week because of concerns over corruption .
But what is to be done ?
The coalition needs some sort of stability to continue their military adventure here , stability which can be partly bought at the cost of keeping former warlords in power and turning a blind eye to fraud .
Aid money keeps flowing in , increasingly linked to military operations .
In the latest counterinsurgency strategy in Kandahar , Operation Hamkari ( co - operation ) will see the insurgent side handled by the security forces while the US provides $ 90 m of aid for the region .
More aid and more fighting , with a questionable amount of progress .
Talking to the Taliban may be an inevitable part of our exit strategy , but only good governance will go anyway towards finding a long - term solution .
But if the policy options come down to continuing a military surge that ca n't and wo n't work , or simply upping and leaving the country , then the outcome is simple ; it 's the Afghans who will be the losers , again ."
2010-07-19,"The White House is revising its Afghanistan strategy to embrace the idea of negotiating with senior members of the Taliban through third parties – a policy to which it had previously been lukewarm .
Negotiating with the Taliban has long been advocated by Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , and the British and Pakistani governments , but resisted by Washington .
The Guardian has learned that while the American government is still officially resistant to the idea of talks with Taliban leaders , behind the scenes a shift is under way and Washington is encouraging Karzai to take a lead in such negotiations .
"" There is a change of mindset in DC , "" a senior official in Washington said .
"" There is no military solution .
That means you have to find something else .
There was something missing . ""
That missing element was talks with the Taliban leadership , the official added .
The American rethink comes in the aftermath of the departure last month of General Stanley McChrystal , the top US commander in Afghanistan .
Barack Obama , apparently frustrated at the way the war is going , has reminded his national security advisers that while he was on the election campaign trail in 2008 , he had advocated talking to America 's enemies .
America is reviewing its Afghanistan policy which is due for completion in December , but officials in Washington , Kabul and Islamabad with knowledge of internal discussions said feelers had been put out to the Taliban .
Negotiations would be conducted largely in secret , through a web of contacts , possibly involving Pakistan and Saudi Arabia or organisations with back - channel links to the Taliban .
"" It will be messy and could take years , "" said a diplomatic source .
The change of heart by the US comes as Afghanistan hosts the biggest international gathering in its capital for 40 years , with representatives from 60 countries including Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , and Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary - general .
The dominant theme of the Kabul conference is "" reintegration "" , which involves reaching out to low - level insurgents to encourage them to lay down their arms .
Earlier this year Richard Holbrooke , Obama 's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , distinguished between "" reintegration "" , which the US supported , and "" reconciliation "" or negotiating with senior Taliban .
Holbrooke said : "" Let me be clear .
There is no American involvement in any reconciliation process .
"" There is growing disenchantment in the US with the war in Afghanistan and members of the Senate 's foreign relations committee last week questioned Holbrooke over what they described as a lack of clarity on an exit strategy .
The US has no agreed position on who among the leaders of the insurgency should be wooed and who would be beyond the pale .
The Taliban leader , Mullah Omar , would be a problem as he provided Osama bin Laden with bases before the 9/11 attacks .
The US would also find it problematic to deal with the Pakistan - based insurgents led by Sirajuddin Haqqani , whose group pioneered suicide attacks in Afghanistan .
The third main element in the insurgency is Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , who has hinted he is ready to break ranks .
A source with knowledge of the process said : "" There is no agreed US position , but there is agreement that Karzai should lead on this .
They would expect the Pakistanis to deliver the Haqqani network in any internal settlement . ""
The US has laid down basic conditions for any group seeking negotiations .
They are : end all ties to al - Qaida , end violence , and accept the Afghan constitution .
A senior Pakistani diplomat said : "" The US needs to be negotiating with the Taliban ; those Taliban with no links to al - Qaida .
We need a power - sharing agreement in Afghanistan , and it will have to be negotiated with all the parties . ""
The Afghan government is already talking to all the shareholders ‚ the Taliban , the Haqqani network , Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , and Mullah Omar .
The Americans have been setting ridiculous preconditions for talks .
You ca n't lay down such preconditions when you are losing . ""
Some Afghan policy specialists are sceptical about whether negotiations would succeed .
Peter Bergen , a specialist on Afghanistan and al - Qaida , told a US Institute of Peace seminar in Washington last week that there were a host of problems with such a strategy , not least why the Taliban should enter negotiations "" when they think they are winning "" .
Audrey Kurth Cronin , a member of the US National War College faculty in Washington , and the author of How Terrorism Ends , said talks with Mullah Omar and the Haqqani network were pointless because there would be no negotiable terms .
She said there could be talks with Hekmatyar , but these would be conducted through back channels , potentially by a third party .
Given his support for jihad , she said , "" it would be unreasonable to expect the US and the UK to do so "" .
Asked how Obama 's Afghan strategy was progressing , a senior former US government official familiar with the latest Pentagon thinking said : "" In a word , poorly .
We seriously need to be developing a revised plan of action that will allow us a chance to achieve sufficient security in a more sustainable manner .
"" Officials have mentioned possible roles in negotiation for the UN and figures such as the veteran UN negotiator , the Algerian Lakhdar Brahimi , who heads , along with the retired US ambassador Thomas Pickering , a New York - based international panel which is looking at such a reconciliation .
Another name mentioned is Michael Semple , an Irishman based in Boston at Harvard 's Kennedy School who has extensive contacts with the Taliban ."
2010-07-25,"A stream of US military intelligence reports accuse Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) spy agency of arming , training and financing the Taliban insurgency since 2004 , the war logs reveal , bringing fresh scrutiny on one of the war 's most contentious issues .
At least 180 files contain allegations of dirty tricks by the powerful agency with accounts of undercover agents training suicide bombers , bundles of money slipping across the border and covert support for a range of sensational plots including the assassination of President Hamid Karzai , attacks on Nato warplanes and even poisoning western troops ' beer supply .
They also link the ISI to some of the war 's most notorious commanders .
In April 2007 for instance , the ISI is alleged to have sent 1,000 motorbikes to the warlord Jalaluddin Haqqani for suicide attacks in Khost and Logar provinces .
But for all their eye - popping details , the intelligence files , which are mostly collated by junior officers relying on informants and Afghan officials , fail to provide a convincing smoking gun for ISI complicity .
Most of the reports are vague , filled with incongruent detail , or crudely fabricated .
The same characters – famous Taliban commanders , well - known ISI officials – and scenarios repeatedly pop up .
And few of the events predicted in the reports subsequently occurred .
A retired senior American officer said ground - level reports were considered to be a mixture of "" rumours , bullshit and second - hand information "" and were weeded out as they passed up the chain of command . ""
As someone who had to sift through thousands of these reports , I can say that the chances of finding any real information are pretty slim , "" said the officer , who has years of experience in the region .
If anything , the jumble of allegations highlights the perils of collecting accurate intelligence in a complex arena where all sides have an interest in distorting the truth . ""
The fog of war is particularly dense in Afghanistan , "" said Michael Semple , a former deputy head of the EU mission there .
"" A barrage of false information is being passed off as intelligence and anyone who wants to operate there needs to be able to sift through it .
The opportunities to be misled are innumerable . ""
The shaky intelligence does not mean the US does not believe the ISI is supporting the Taliban .
The spy agency nurtured the Taliban in the 1990s and , although it purported to sever its ties after 9/11 , is believed to maintain the relationship .
The British and US governments have repeatedly urged Pakistan to root out the Taliban from their sanctuary inside the border , with little effect .
In July 2008 the deputy head of the CIA , Stephen Kappes , flew to Islamabad to reportedly confront the ISI with evidence that the agency orchestrated a suicide attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul that month which killed 54 people including the Indian defence attache .
The CIA claimed to have intercepted phone conversations between ISI officers and the militants who carried out the attack .
Pakistani strategists see the Taliban as a useful proxy to marginalise the influence of arch - rival India .
Indeed plots to attack Indian facilities in Afghanistan provide some of the most plausible allegations in the files .
One report from November 2007 said the ISI was plotting an attack on the Indian consulate in Jalalabad ; another , titled "" ISI order murder and kidnappings "" , has the agency offering between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000 for the assassination of Indian road workers .
But many of the 180 reports appear to betray as much about the motivation of the sources than those of the alleged foreign puppet - masters .
Some US officers were aware of this .
One report from 2006 notes that an informant "" divulges information for monetary remuneration and likely fabricated or exaggerated the above report for just that reason "" .
Some of the most striking claims come from the National Directorate of Security , Afghanistan 's foremost spy agency and a bitter rival to the ISI .
In July and August 2008 the NDS passed information to the US that three Pakistan - trained militants plotting to kill Karzai had been groomed by a named ISI officer and had trained at the Zarb Momen camp outside Karachi .
The attackers were Palestinian and Arab , the report said , and intended to strike during a visit by Karzai to a Kabul mosque or the luxury Serena hotel .
But the report 's strong assertions fade under retrospective scrutiny .
The predicted assault on Karzai never took place ( the last reported attempt was in April 2008 , four months earlier ) , and there is no known militant camp called Zarb Momen in Karachi , a city with hundreds of hardline madrasas .
The al - Rashid Trust , a charity with militant links , publishes a magazine by the same name , said Amir Rana , an Islamabad - based militancy expert .
The miltiary 's grading system offers one way of sifting the ISI file .
Some 27 of the 180 reports are graded as C3 and above , meaning they come from a "" fairly reliable source "" and are "" possibly true "" .
But many such reports appear highly implausible .
In February 2007 the ISI and insurgents planned "" to buy alcoholic drinks from markets in Miranshah [ in Pakistan 's tribal belt ] and Peshawar [ in order to ] mix them with poison and use them for poisoning ANSF and ISAF troops "" according to a C3 report .
The Karzai plot is assessed to be "" probably true "" .
Apparently more credible reports of ISI skulduggery are marked SEWOC , or Signals Intelligence Electronic Warfare Operations Centre , signifying they come from intercepted communications .
One SEWOC report , in December 2007 , accused the ISI of deploying children as suicide bombers .
But the military source said that such intelligence was also prone to distortion , and that its value depended on whose conversation was being eavesdropped .
"" If we ever found out anything that the ISI or Pakistani military were somehow complicit in the insurgency , it never came from these sources .
Never , "" he said .
One name that frequently surfaces is that of General Hamid Gul , director general of the ISI between 1987 and 1989 , who is referenced in eight reports .
One has him smuggling magnetic mines into Afghanistan to attack Nato troops ; in another he is plotting to kidnap United Nations staff to bargain for imprisoned Pakistani militants .
A report from January 2009 has Gul meeting Arab militants in Pakistan 's tribal belt to send suicide vehicles into Afghanistan .
"" It was not known whether Hamid Gul was acting with the knowledge or consent of the ISI , "" the report states .
But while Gul , 73 , is a well - known fundamentalist ideologue in Pakistan , experts say he is unlikely to play a frontline role in the fighting .
Afghan informers may have used his name – he is notorious in Afghanistan – to spice up their stories , said Semple .
"" There 's a pattern of using a dramatis personae of famous ISI officers and Afghan commanders , and recurring reports of dramatic developments such as the delivery of surface - to - air missiles , to give these reports credibility , "" he said .
"" But most of them are simply fabricated . ""
Afghanistan has a long history of intelligence intrigues that stretches back to the early 19th century .
Afghans have learned to use intelligence as a tool to influence the foreign powers occupying their land .
In the past quarter century it has become a lucrative source of income in a country with few employment opportunities .
Since 2001 intelligence has become a tool to influence US policymakers , who enjoy the greatest military clout in the region but are poorly informed about its intricacies .
The retired US officer said some NDS officials "" wanted to create the impression that Pakistani complicity was a threat to the US "" .
And more broadly speaking , "" there 's an Afghan prejudice that wants to see an ISI agent under every rock "" .
US generals are aware of the problem .
In January Major General Michael Flynn said foreign newspaper articles about Afghanistan were more useful than the information collected by his own soldiers in the field .
The huge intelligence apparatus in Afghanistan was "" only marginally relevant "" to Nato 's overall war plan , he said .
"" We 're no more than fingernail - deep in our understanding of the environment . """
2010-07-26,"Hamid Karzai is said to be shocked by the massive leak of classified military documents , but to be hoping further allegations of links between Pakistan and the Taliban will support his claim that Islamabad is directly supporting the insurgency .
Waheed Omar , the Afghan president 's spokesman , told journalists the Afghan government would not seek to exploit revelations of previously unknown incidents in which Nato troops have killed Afghan civilians , even though in the past Karzai has publicly berated the US and its allies after high - profile tragedies .
Omar said : "" As far as the substance of these leaked documents , the president 's reaction was that most of this is not new and has been discussed in the past , and has often been raised in the past with our international partners . ""
Omar praised the "" good progress "" made over the last 18 months to lower the number of civilians accidentally killed .
General Stanley McChrystal , the recently sacked US commander of Nato troops in Afghanistan , took the issue particularly seriously and introduced tough rules of engagement restricting the use of force by foreign soldiers .
Meanwhile , William Hague , the foreign secretary , speaking in Brussels , said the leaks would not harm international efforts in Afghanistan . ""
A good deal of progress is being made , in building up the capacity of the Afghan state and in Afghanistan working together with so many nations in the world , "" he said .
"" So I hope any such leaks will not poison that atmosphere , and I do n't think they will . ""
But observers in Kabul warned that allegations of Pakistani involvement – while not new – could heighten tensions with Afghanistan 's neighbour . .
Haroun Mir , a political analyst , Karzai critic and parliamentary candidate , predicted that the intelligence documents alleging skulduggery by Pakistan 's Inter - Service Intelligence agency ( ISI ) wwould make it harder for the coalition to tolerate anything less than full Pakistani support in fighting the Taliban . ""
For us , this is no secret –
it is something we have been talking about since day one .
But now there is no secret left .
These are no longer allegations ; these are facts , "" he said .
"" It is up to the US and the UK to do something about it .
Every day we see Nato soldiers die and Pakistan is very clearly linked to these killings , but there is no reaction .
The west just rewards bad behaviour by the Pakistanis . ""
He said that when the details are re - reported by Afghan media , they will fuel popular conspiracy theories that the western powers are not serious about beating the Taliban and instead are looking for excuses for the permanent occupation of Afghanistan .
Any anti - Pakistani uproar will probably disrupt the detente between Karzai and Pakistan 's leadership .
For months now Karzai has pointedly dropped his old anti - Pakistani rhetoric , and has held a series of meetings with Pakistan 's army chief , Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , and Ahmad Shuja Pasha , the head of the ISI – the very organisation cited in the documents as being part of an alleged plot to assassinate the Afghan president .
Mir said : "" We have all been trying to warn President Karzai that you can not trust the Pakistanis .
They are not co - operating with the US and the UK , so why should they co - operate with Afghanistan ? """
2010-07-29,"Hamid Karzai has called on Nato to destroy insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan , escalating a war of words sparked by allegations the Taliban are receiving official Pakistani support made in this week 's leak of US military intelligence documents .
The Afghan president said the war on terrorism was not based in Afghanistan , "" but rather this war is in the sanctuaries , funding centres and training places of terrorism which are outside Afghanistan . ""
Whether we are able to destroy these sanctuaries or not is another question .
We will try what we can … our international allies have this ability , but the question is why they are not doing it ? ""
His comments mark a return to the fiery language directed against Pakistan not seen for many months from the Afghan leader , who has been working hard to forge better ties with Islamabad .
In Washington Barack Obama held a special meeting of national security advisers to discuss Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Among those taking part were the defence secretary , Robert Gates , the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , the head of the CIA , Leon Panetta and , by video conferencing , the US commander in overall charge in Afghanistan , General David Petraeus .
The meeting was scheduled before the Wikileaks disclosures about failures in the Afghanistan war and the allegedly duplicitous role of the Pakistan intelligence agency .
The leak has dominated the news agenda in the US all week .
Focus in the last 24 hours has switched from concern about the failures of the war to whether the lives of Afghan informers have been put at risk .
Earlier this week Rangeen Dadfar Spanta , Afghanistan 's national security adviser , called on the west to change its policy towards Pakistan in light of the Wikileaks revelations .
David Cameron added fuel to the fire by telling an audience in India that Pakistan must not be allowed "" to promote the export of terror , whether to India or whether to Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world . ""
The Afghan government has long claimed Pakistan is playing a double game , supplying a vital land route for Nato equipment into Afghanistan while tolerating the Taliban in and around the city of Quetta .
Afghan security officials have frequently accused Pakistan 's spies in the Inter - Services Intelligence agency of involvement in attacks inside Afghanistan .
Although Kabul says the leaked US intelligence documents back up its claims , Karzai criticised the publication of sensitive information .
"" I heard this yesterday … that names of certain Afghans who co - operate with the coalition Nato have been also revealed in these documents , "" he said .
"" This indeed is extremely irresponsible and shocking because , whether those individuals acted legitimately or illegitimately by providing information to Nato forces , they are lives .
And the lives are in danger now . ""
Though his remarks are a return to normal for a politician whose public denunciations of Pakistan have angered the US for years , some analysts believe the Wikileaks revelations are a setback for Karzai , spoiling his efforts to reach an understanding with Pakistan 's top leadership .
Karzai has had several meetings recently with the chiefs of the Pakistani army and the ISI , prompting concern from his opponents that he is preparing to sell out to a neighbour seeking a degree of control over affairs inside Afghanistan .
Ahmed Rashid , a respected Pakistani analyst of the Afghan conflict , argues in this week 's Spectator the leak has inconvenienced all sides .
He writes : "" A few months ago Hamid Karzai would have been thrilled to have confirmation that American officers are speaking openly about how divisions of Pakistani intelligence are helping the Taliban .
But after spending eight years criticising the ISI , he recently decided to cosy up to them . """
2010-08-16,"Under plans announced by a spokesman for Afghan president Hamid Karzai today , private security firms in Afghanistan will be disbanded within four months , and replaced by the Afghan police force .
According to the most recent data from the US Department of Defense ( DoD ) , there are around 112,000 contractors employed by the US military currently working in Afghanistan .
Of those , 16,733 are private security contractors ( PSCs ) , protecting personnel , convoys and bases .
By contrast , 11,610 of the 95,000 DoD contractors in Iraq work in the private security field .
Those employed in Afghanistan are overwhelmingly Afghan nationals ; 70 % of all contractors and 93 % of PSCs , compared to just 18 % of all contractors and only 10 % of PSCs working in Iraq who are Iraqi .
Only 0.8 % of contractors in Afghanistan who work in private security are American citizens ( 9 % in Iraq ) .
The ratio of contractors to troops also differs between the two theatres of war .
In Afghanistan , there are 1.42 contractors to every US soldier , while in Iraq the ratio is much lower at 1:1 .

2010-08-16,"Afghanistan 's substantial private security industry , which guards everything from western embassies to Nato supply convoys , is set to be scrapped within four months under dramatic new plans from Hamid Karzai .
According to Karzai 's spokesman , the Afghan president is due to publish a decree that will bring forward plans to dissolve all private security companies and hand over responsibility to the country 's still ill - trained and often corrupt police force .
In November , Karzai said the firms , which employ tens of thousands of gunmen , would be phased out by late 2011 .
The sudden announcement caught the private security industry by surprise , with many western managers in Kabul simply refusing to believe that the international community , which relies heavily on private armed guards to secure embassies and other facilities , would tolerate Afghan police guarding their foreign staff .
"" If you go and talk to any of the big donors you will find that none of them will stay in the country if they ca n't have international security companies protecting them , "" said one senior executive of a major international security company .
He said his organisation was still absorbing the unexpected news , saying the threat to shut down security companies "" seems to be a bit of a cyclical issue coming back every four to six months "" .
"" It seems to be almost every time there is push from the US on anti - corruption , there is push back by the Afghan government saying [ corruption ] is all the private security companies ' fault , "" he said .
The Kabul - based manager for another large foreign security company said the plan was "" completely unfeasible "" . ""
The Afghan security forces do n't have the resources , the ability or the training to take over .
And most importantly , they are not trusted by our clients who would sooner pull out than be protected by the Afghan police . ""
He said the sudden announcement was typical of the Afghan government . ""
Transition might work if there is a sensible timescale and the clear demonstration of capacity , but the way this government does things is to make instant decisions without any planning . ""
He also echoed the views of others in the private security market who see years of government attempts to regulate the sector as driven by official corruption .
"" Afghanisation is often used as an umbrella , an excuse to pull someone else 's hand out of the money pot and shove yours in – that 's a huge contributory factor with what 's going on . ""
The industry is seen by the Afghan government and its key allies as a source of instability , with many of the companies little more than private militias operating in their own specific parts of the country .
Currently , there are 52 registered companies with around 30,000 staff .
However , there are also huge numbers of unregistered companies , including 22 in the southern province of Kandahar alone .
Some estimates say there could be as many as 50,000 people working for private security companies in Afghanistan .
A recent US Congress study heavily criticised a $ 2.2bn ( £ 1.4bn ) US government contract for trucking services , which said some of the security companies involved in protecting road convoys were paying protection money directly to insurgents .
For years , the average pay for Afghans working for private security companies has outstripped those for policeman and soldiers , making it difficult for the government to recruit its own security forces .
Today a Nato military spokesman said the alliance was "" in total support of the Afghanistan president 's intent to do away with security companies and to do away with the need for private security companies "" .
However , he said this should be done "" in a logical and sequential manner and as conditions permit "" .
The government has made various attempts to clamp down on the operations of the private security industry , recently ordering guards at all companies to wear a standardised uniform , which is due to come into effect in the coming weeks .
But for all the trouble such companies cause , the entire military effort in Afghanistan has essentially outsourced most of its logistics requirements to the private sector , making it totally reliant on security contractors to bring in food , fuel and equipment to Nato bases all over the country .
The Afghan army and police are currently experiencing breakneck growth and undergoing reform programmes to try to make them ready to take over from foreign troops by 2014 .
Most embassies would not want to be guarded by an Afghan police force plagued with corruption and largely illiterate .
A western security official predicted that most embassies would try to avoid any ban , possibly citing a longstanding agreement between Nato and the Afghan government that gives near - total immunity to contractors working for the international community .
Another option would be to issue embassy guards with diplomatic passports .
The UK and US embassies said they could not comment on the matter until the presidential decree was published .
Karzai first announced his plans in his inauguration speech last November after he was reappointed president in the wake of national elections . ""
The goal of a powerful national government can be realised by the strong presence of national security forces in all parts of the country , "" he said at the time . ""
Within the next two years , we want operations by all private national and international security firms to be ended and their duties delegated to Afghan security entities . """
2010-08-17,"Electoral officials in Afghanistan have decided not to open nearly 900 polling stations in the most violent areas of the country for next month 's parliamentary election , in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the massive fraud that wrecked last year 's presidential contest .
Despite worries about disenfranchising large numbers of voters , the country 's independent election commission is expected to announce tomorrow that it has been forced to abandon initial plans to open 6,835 polling centres , after Afghan security chiefs and Nato commanders decreed that parts of the country are too dangerous for voting to take place .
According to an IEC spokesman , President Hamid Karzai and General David Petraeus , the commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan , reviewed the proposed list of polling stations on Saturday , which led to the electoral body removing an additional 100 stations that the security forces had said were safe .
Hardest hit will be the south and the east where the population is largely Pashtun , the ethnic group from which the Taliban derive much of its support .
"" We have no option but to close these polling stations , "" said Farid Afghanzai , an IEC spokesman , who said the commission was acutely aware that many people would be unable to vote .
Last year Karzai insisted on as many voting centres opening as possible in the insurgency - torn south , leading to so - called "" ghost polling stations "" in areas so dangerous that election monitors had no chance of being present to record or prevent massive electoral fraud , including ballot boxes being stuffed with crudely filled - in voting papers .
A total of 2,545 candidates , including 410 women , are competing for 249 seats in the Wolesi Jirga , Afghanistan 's lower house , on 18 September .
Kabul 's 33 seats are being contested by 662 people , partly because candidates from insecure parts of the country have chosen to stand in the capital instead .
Foreign election experts have in general been pleased with Afghanistan 's preparations for this year 's election . ""
In a sense it is a benefit that we had such a bad one last year , "" said one western official closely involved with monitoring elections who did not wanted to be named .
"" It 's a sort of reference point for them to make improvements . ""
However , even optimistic observers say there are still enormous potential problems , including a chaotic registration system that has issued some 17 m voter cards – an estimated 5 m of which are thought to be duplicates or fraudulently acquired .
Others fear that the risks of a botched election are so great that it must be postponed , even though candidates have already spent fortunes covering Afghanistan 's cities with posters . ""
If thousands of people in the Pashtun belt are unable to vote there will be huge questions about disenfranchisement , "" said Candace Rondeaux , a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group .
"" It will give the Taliban another excuse to point at this as yet another western experiment aimed at excluding large swathes of the population from the political process . ""
She said the current record levels of Taliban violence could lead to around one - third of polling stations not opening on the day , potentially threatening the legitimacy of the new parliament .
Qari Yousuf Ahmadi , a Taliban spokesman , told the Guardian that the movement has not yet decided whether it will launch the sort of violent intimidation campaign that kept people from the polls last year and which included threats – carried out in at least one case – to cut off the fingers of anyone who voted .
This year 's campaign has already been hit by violence : two candidates have been murdered and three kidnapped , and there have been reports that others have received death threats .
Another concern is whether the Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) will have the ability to process large amounts of fraud , particularly as the most experienced foreign commissioner has recently returned home to South Africa amid fears that he is seriously ill .
Last year the watchdog was drawn into fierce political battles with Karzai and his allies after it uncovered evidence that one in three of his votes were fraudulent .
The board , which was deliberately set up to be dominated by a majority of three non - Afghans , was accused of foreign interference and was deeply resented by Karzai .
In a move that caused international outrage , he issued a decree giving him full power to appoint all of the commissioners .
Consequently , this year two of the five are not from Afghanistan , including Johann Kriegler , the judge who has gone back to South Africa .
An spokesman for the ECC said he could not say when Kriegler would return to Afghanistan or whether his departure was linked to illness ."
2010-08-27,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has criticised American plans to start withdrawing troops from the country next summer , saying that naming the date has given the Taliban insurgency "" a morale boost "" .
His remarks echoed claims earlier in the week by the head of the US Marine Corps that plans to begin drawing down forces in Afghanistan from July were invigorating insurgents .
General James Conway said foreign forces should only withdraw when Afghan forces are ready and able to take over – a view also expressed earlier this month by the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan , General David Petraeus .
In a statement following a meeting with US congressmen in Kabul , Karzai said civilian casualties caused by allied military operations were hampering the campaign against the Taliban .
The US has sent an extra 30,000 troops to Afghanistan since December 2009 in an effort to defeat the insurgency .
Karzai also criticised a lack of concentration on "" destroying the terrorists ' refuge "" in Pakistan .
In a BBC interview , the Afghan government 's national security adviser , Dr Rangin Dadfar Spanta , said fighting the war on Afghan soil was not enough .
"" Even if we defeat the Taliban , al - Qaida and other terrorist groups within Afghanistan , [ if ] we do n't destroy the recruitment centre , we do n't destroy the causes , it is not possible to win the war , "" he said .
Spanta has repeatedly accused Pakistan of nurturing terrorism by providing sanctuary and support to the Taliban and other militant networks .
He says Islamabad still regards Afghanistan as within its sphere of influence .
The Republican congressman Bob Inglis , who was in the US group that met Karzai , said the president asked for more help in stopping attacks from Pakistan . ""
He seemed pretty pumped up , very determined and energetic and optimistic , which was not the way I thought we 'd find him , "" Inglis told the Associated Press news agency .
Inglis said the group raised the issue of corruption and received assurances from Karzai that he was working on it .
Last month , one of Karzai 's security advisers , Mohammad Zia Salehi , was arrested by an anti - corruption taskforce on charges of soliciting a bribe , but was released after the president 's intervention .
The Washington Post has alleged that Salehi is one of a number of high - ranking officials being paid by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .
The New York Times has previously alleged that Ahmed Wali Karzai , the president 's half - brother , was also being paid by the CIA .
The CIA has disputed the claims , calling them dangerous and counterproductive .
Ahmed Wali Karzai , the head of the provincial council in Kandahar , has denied accusations of being linked to the opium trade ."
2010-08-29,"One of Afghanistan 's most senior government prosecutors said yesterday that he was forced into retirement after aggressively promoting corruption investigations against top officials , including one of Hamid Karzai 's most trusted aides .
Fazel Ahmed Faqiryar , a lawyer well - regarded by foreign rule - of - law experts , lost his position as deputy attorney general at a time of growing US impatience with President Karzai over his apparent attempts to block sensitive cases and to rein in the powers of the western - backed Major Crime Task Force , the so - called "" Afghan FBI "" hailed as the centrepiece of a new push against corruption .
Speaking in his flat in Kabul , Faqiryar said he was made to retire last week because of his stance against the corrupt activities of some of the country 's best - connected people , including Mohammed Zia Salehi , the head of Afghanistan 's National Security Council .
Salehi was arrested in July after being caught accepting a bribe of a car for his help in derailing a major fraud enquiry .
But there are fears that the breakthrough investigation , led by an elite unit supported by officers from the FBI and the UK 's Serious Organised Crime Agency , could come to nothing after Karzai put massive pressure on the attorney general 's office for Salehi to be released .
Yesterday Faqiryar said the Salehi investigation was just the tip of an iceberg of cases against top officials prepared by Afghan investigators and prosecutors .
But he said nearly all had been stalled by Mohammed Ishaq Aloko , the attorney general who answers directly to Karzai . ""
He was always asking us to delay that case on that governor or that minister .
Or he would say we ca n't send that high - profile case to court , "" he said .
He said a number of cabinet ministers , Afghan ambassadors serving abroad and provincial governors have solid cases against them , largely involving money creamed off contracts or other illegal kickbacks .
The departure of Faqiryar will further heighten US concerns that Afghan anti - corruption measures are not receiving adequate support .
One western diplomat who works on rule - of - law issues , said pressure from foreign countries was not working and was unlikely to in the future . ""
These people are untouchables because there is no political will to do anything about it .
No matter what outside pressure there is , Karzai always blocks these prosecutions , we have known that for a long time , "" the diplomat said .
At 72 years old , Faqiryar was due to retire , and Aloko had recommended his departure to Karzai more than a month ago , but nothing happened .
All of that changed when the palace was outraged by a television interview done by Faqiryar 's deputy , Amrodin Wafa .
He not only said that numerous ministers were under investigation , but that Salehi had been ordered three times to come to the attorney general 's office to help investigators , but had refused .
Salehi was initially arrested on July , but was soon released after he called Karzai for help .
The eight - month investigation , which included hours of intercepted phone calls , also revealed that Salehi was charged with dipping into a presidential slush fund to pay off Karzai 's political allies .
After the short - lived arrest of his close aide , Karzai publicly made clear his fury with the MCTF , saying that foreigners were interfering in Afghanistan 's affairs , and that the task force would be brought under his control and all its cases reviewed .
The Salehi scandal , the complaints of senior Afghan investigators and prosecutors that their work has been obstructed and Karzai 's vow to neuter the MCTF has created a major row with Washington .
With fears that stories of Karzai protecting corrupt cronies could destroy critical support for the war in Afghanistan in the US Congress , which has already $ 4bn in financial aid in protest against Afghan corruption , Senator John Kerry travelled to Kabul this month to urge Karzai to take the issue more seriously .
While Karzai publicly promised to respect the independence of the MCTF his office has still not yet published a promised decree establishing its powers .
Faqiryar said that after a promising start the MCTF had been destroyed by political interference .
"" It was doing very well before with the help of the FBI , but I do n't think they [ will be able to arrest ] high - profile people as long as certain elements interfere , "" he said .
"" The fight against corruption wo n't get anywhere . ""

2010-08-29,"After 37 years , 295 episodes and countless shots of one woman 's wrinkled stockings , the final edition of Last of the Summer Wine is broadcast tonight .
The gentle show is a favourite of both the Queen and the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , but the BBC announced this year that it would not recommission another series .
Many of the programme 's most famous characters will be absent from the final episode , but little has changed in the Yorkshire village of Holmfirth since the first edition went out in 1973 .
Nora Batty and her ill - fitting hosiery will not make an appearance ; nor will Compo , her beanie - hatted admirer – the actors in both roles have long since died .
But 89-year - old Peter Sallis , still playing grumpy old Clegg , will feature .
In its 1980s heydey , the Sunday night institution attracted audiences of 19 million .
It is still an enormously successful export for the BBC , showing everywhere from Arkansas to Afghanistan .
Filmed in Holmfirth , in West Yorkshire , the show helped the town flourish after the demise of its textile industry .
Every day , busloads of fans visit the Last of the Summer Wine museum and take refreshment in the Wrinkled Stocking tea room , or get their picture taken on Nora Batty 's steps .
Some Holmfirth residents ended up with parts in the programme .
Ron Backhouse , who runs The White Horse , the local pub , also played the on - screen landlord for 18 years after pulling pints for the production team .
Greg Christofi , who represents Holmfirth Central for Holme Valley parish council , said the town would miss the series but was more than prepared to cope in its absence .
"" The programme has been really good for us , it 's brought a lot of attention to Holmfirth .
We are proud of it .
It has showcased our town and has been good for the local economy . ""
Colin Frost , who leads Last of the Summer Wine tours , said visitor numbers this summer were up , and – despite the fact the cameras have stopped rolling –
he predicted TV repeats and DVDs would win over new generations . ""
Ask yourself : how long have the Brontes been dead ?
And how busy is Haworth ?
"" he told the BBC .
"" There 's still interest from all over the world .
It 'll never die . """
2010-09-03,"Officials in Afghanistan are resisting US pressure for a wide - ranging clean - up of Kabul Bank , which is mired in allegations of corruption that have engulfed some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the country .
The stand - off came as the bank 's third - biggest shareholder , Mahmoud Karzai – the elder brother of President Hamid Karzai – called for a US bailout of the stricken bank .
The central bank on Tuesday ordered that the chairman and chief executive of Kabul Bank , who are both large shareholders in the bank , should step down from their positions and a government official be appointed to manage the bank .
But western officials with intimate knowledge of the financial drama said the US treasury wanted to see much stronger action .
That would include bringing the bank into line with international norms , not least the appointment of a fully independent board capable of standing up to overmighty shareholders .
Such independence would risk bringing to light allegations that members of the country 's business and political elite have , for years , apparently got away with using deposits of thousands of ordinary Afghans to fund lavish lifestyles .
The bank 's funds are said to have been used to invest in loss - making enterprises and , allegedly , the re - election campaign of President Karzai .
In the words of one foreign official , the US treasury is anxious to "" rip the lid "" off the cowboy capitalism that has been allowed to flourish at Kabul Bank .
But sources close to the negotiations say the central bank is under intense pressure to resist US demands .
"" What [ the US treasury is ] asking for is not completely unreasonable , from a prudential regulatory perspective , "" said one official .
"" But there are lots of assets off the books .
The hunch is that shareholders would like to continue to use bank assets how they want , rather than bring it into line with international best practice . ""
The central bank 's spokesman could not be reached by phone today .
Earlier in the week Abdul Qadir Fitrat , the bank 's governor , said the removal of Sher Khan Farnood as chairman and Khalilullah Frozi as chief executive had been a long - planned decision to bring to an end the situation where the two largest shareholders controlled all the operations .
But western officials and banking industry sources say the government was forced to clean up the bank 's suspected dubious practices after infighting between the two men threatened the bank 's future .
The collapse of the institution that manages the salaries of the country 's police and army would create havoc , as well as hitting the Afghan economy .
Mahmoud Karzai , a minority stakeholder with 7 % of the shares , said he welcomed a full audit of the bank and that he was concerned about three problems that may have occurred under Farnood and Frozi
: lending over the bank 's limits , lending to shareholders and investing outside the country in "" risky businesses "" .
When asked whether he thought anyone should go to jail if fraud is uncovered he said , "" I do n't think so because that would create chaos .
Maybe there should be fines or something like that . ""
But he said he would never let the bank be taken over : "" It 's an independent bank owned by the shareholders and we will not allow the government or anyone else to take it over . ""
Karzai had earlier told the Boston Globe that "" America should do something "" and the US treasury should agree to guarantee the bank .
But when contacted by the Guardian he was anxious to sound a note of confidence , and said that with the bank 's $ 400 m in cash he did not think a bailout would be necessary .
He said he only floated the idea of the US paying money because he held the American embassy and US newspapers responsible for starting the panic when they reported Kabul Bank had made $ 300 m in losses , which he strongly denied .
But Karzai conceded that it had already suffered a bank run , with almost $ 160 m withdrawn in the last two days alone – a huge amount considering Afghanistan 's tiny banking sector .
Despite efforts by Karzai and the finance minister to assure customers , the test will be whether the panic continues when banks open tomorrow .
With so many of the bank 's assets unlikely to be easily sold for cash a bailout could be huge , perhaps requiring $ 600 m , in the estimate of one bank executive .
The financial scandal is a huge embarrassment for Afghanistan , with many leading figures linked to the unorthodox bank whose brazen business practices were allowed to flourish despite a modern banking law drawn up by foreign experts .
In a country that lacked any banking infrastructure in late 2001 , the bank mushroomed into Afghanistan 's largest financial institution by attracting depositors who had never had bank accounts before , allegedly in part by running a lottery system where account holders had the chance to win large prizes .
Sources claimed those deposits were then used to fund enterprises belonging to shareholders or their families , while investors wanting to set up legitimate businesses often got nowhere ."
2010-09-07,"Well - known Afghan journalist Sayed Hamid Noori died on Sunday after being found with stab wounds outside his Kabul home .
President Hamid Karzai issued a statement ordering authorities to spare no effort in bringing the killers to justice .
Noori , a former state television presenter and newspaper editor , was vice president of Afghanistan 's Association of Independent Journalists ( AIJ ) and a teacher of young journalists .
AIJ president Abdul Hameed Mubarez said Noori had left home after receiving a series of phone calls , suggesting that he either knew his assailants or had been set up .

2010-09-27,"Top echelons of the Taliban have approached the government in Kabul about peace talks , said General David Petraeus , the Nato commander in Afghanistan yesterday .
Petraeus told reporters that there have been no substantive negotiations so far , but news of the Taliban 's approaches ahead of the establishment of a high peace council this week could signal that direct talks are not far off .
Although there have been contacts at various levels between President Hamid Karzai 's government and the Taliban for several months , Petraeus 's comments are the first time they have been revealed to be at such a high level .
"" There are very high - level Taliban leaders who have sought to reach out to the highest levels of the Afghan government , and they have done that , "" he said .
Karzai , in a reflection in his lack of confidence in coalition forces to defeat the insurgency , has made repeated efforts to reach out to members of the Taliban calling them "" brothers "" and "" dear Talibs "" and asking that their leaders be removed from a UN sanctions list .
But it doing so , he has drawn scorn from some political allies , among them Afghanistan 's ethnic minorities who fear a new wave of repression if the Taliban is allowed to share power .
American military commanders have backed the Afghan president 's efforts , saying they reflect a similar approach to Sunni insurgents in Iraq . ""
President Karzai 's conditions are very clear , very established , and we support them as we did in Iraq , as the British did in Northern Ireland …
this is the way you end insurgencies , "" said Petraeus .
Karzai 's spokesman , Waheed Omer , confirmed to reporters that there have been high level contacts and signals but said they do not amount to negotiations .
"" There are signs that they are ready for talks , and this intensified after the president announced the programme of reintegration and reconciliation after the peace jirga ( council ) , "" he told the New York Times .
"" There have been different levels of contact - sometimes direct and sometimes indirect . ""
Karzai is expected to appoint the high peace council this week ."
2010-09-28,"Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , wept today as he appealed to his compatriots to "" come to their senses "" on the day his government launched a "" high peace council "" to bring an end to the war with the Taliban .
The appointment of the 68-member council is seen as opening the door to direct discussions with senior elements of the Taliban who have approached the government about talks .
But the council – which will be the sole body overseeing negotiations with the insurgents – has been criticised as dominated by government sympathisers and former warlords with blood on their hands .
Missing are former Taliban leaders who have been involved in back channel efforts to establish peace talks , and representatives of civil society .
Only eight of the council 's members are women .
Karzai launched the Process of Peace , Reconciliation and Reintegration yesterday with an emotional speech in which he called on Afghans to move more rapidly toward peace or risk seeing another generation forced into exile and losing their national identity .
"" I do not want Mirwais , my son , to be a foreigner , I do not want this .
I want Mirwais to be Afghan , "" said a weeping Karzai , who spent years in exile in Pakistan in opposition to the Soviet occupation and then the Taliban . ""
Therefore come to your senses …
you are witnessing what is happening on our soil and only through our efforts can our homeland be ours .
"" Karzai 's appeal will resonate with many Afghans who fear the conflict with the Taliban will drag on indefinitely .
For that reason , many have thrown their support behind Karzai 's push for negotiations with the insurgents , although others say they fear talks might result in the Taliban returning to power .
General David Petraeus , the Nato commander in Afghanistan , this week revealed that the top echelons of the Taliban have approached the government in Kabul about peace talks .
A Pentagon analyst , who did not wish to be named because he is not authorised to speak to reporters , said there are direct phone discussions between the Afghan government and some leaders of the Taliban and other insurgent groups .
There was a "" momentum toward the opening of a frank dialogue "" , but that did not mean the two sides were near agreement .
Karzai said responsibility for handling negotiations would lie with a council that includes two former presidents and at least two former Taliban officials as well as clerics . ""
The government of Afghanistan with further seriousness … should take vigorous steps for bringing peace to this soil as soon as possible , "" he said at an international literacy day event at a Kabul school .
Shortly before Karzai spoke a suicide bomber driving a motorised rickshaw killed a deputy provincial governor and five other people in eastern Afghanistan , the latest casualties in one of the bloodiest years of the war .
Karzai 's peace plan is centred on luring foot soldiers away from the battlefield with cash and work while seeking reconciliation with insurgent leaders .
Initial responses to the appointment of the council 's 68 members from Afghan civil society , analysts and diplomats in Kabul were not encouraging .
Zabi Mazoori , a member of the civil society group on transitional justice , said : "" I support any efforts that can lead to bringing peace in Afghanistan but many of the members of this committee are accused of committing crimes and killing civilians when in power .
They should have chosen people who are neutral and not accused . ""
Mazoori expressed the concern of many Afghans that negotiations could lead the Taliban back to power . ""
Before 2001 when they were in power they committed some of the most horrific crimes – group massacres , burning entire areas down into the ground , "" he said .
"" They did not give any rights to minority groups .
Hopefully this council will not compromise with the rights we have had for the past nine years . ""
Rachel Reid , a Human Rights Watch analyst , said : "" Many of these men are unlikely peacemakers .
There are too many names here that Afghans will associate with war crimes , warlordism and corruption .
This is a disappointing outcome for Afghan women and girls . ""
Karzai 's spokesman , Waheed Omer , defended the selection .
Those chosen were "" very influential "" .
The Pentagon analyst said that while some Taliban leaders were feeling pressure from the US - led international force in Afghanistan , others believed the government was in the weaker position and they could win big concessions .
As critical as those named to the council are those missing such as the former Taliban foreign minister , Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil , and Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef , former Taliban ambassador to the UN .
Both are said to be involved in back - channel discussions and their omission was seen as a surprise .
"" Those who are the most influential and most respected with the Taliban are not there ‚ "" one diplomat said .
The names were "" the usual suspects "" and that was "" not encouraging "" ."
2010-09-28,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , today appealed for reconciliation as he named some of the members of a peace council that will try to reach out to the Taliban .
Karzai wept as he called on Afghans to "" come to their senses "" and move more quickly towards peace or risk seeing the next generation flee abroad and lose their Afghan identity .
"" I do not want Mirwais , my son , to be a foreigner – I do not want this .
I want Mirwais to be Afghan , "" he said at an international literacy day event at the Amani high school in Kabul . ""
Therefore , come to your senses ...
you are witnessing what is happening on our soil and only through our efforts can our homeland be ours . "" .
The president spent many years in exile in Pakistan during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s and during the later Taliban rule .
His show of emotion came as the Afghan government announced the appointment of almost 70 people to a new "" high peace council "" , formalising the attempts already under way to reconcile with key Taliban leaders .
Waheed Omar , an Afghan presidential spokesman , said the council would guide contacts with Taliban leaders who have got in touch with leading government officials either directly or through back channels .
"" In the past , there have been no negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban ... only there were some contacts and some signs from both sides , "" Omar said .
Any future contacts , talks or negotiations would be handled through the peace council , he added .
The body includes two former presidents and at least two ex - Taliban officials , as well as clerics and women .
Its members were agreed after talks with tribal chiefs and powerbrokers , some of whom sided with the US in the toppling of the Taliban .
The Afghan government said it would reconcile with those who renounced violence , embraced the Afghan constitution and severed links with terrorists .
General David Petraeus , the Nato commander in Afghanistan , said yesterday that high echelons of the Taliban had approached the Afghan government about peace talks .
Although there have been contacts at various levels between Karzai 's government and the Taliban for several months , Petraeus 's comments revealed for the first time that they had been at a senior level .
"" There are very high - level Taliban leaders who have sought to reach out to the highest levels of the Afghan government , and they have done that , "" he said .
Karzai has made repeated efforts to reconcile with members of the Taliban , calling them "" brothers "" and "" dear Talibs "" and asking that their leaders be removed from a UN sanctions list .
He has been criticised by some political allies , including ethnic minorities and women 's groups who fear a new wave of repression if the Taliban is allowed to share power .
US military commanders , however , have backed his efforts , saying they reflected a similar approach to dealing with Sunni insurgents in Iraq .
In June , Karzai summoned a peace jirga , or traditional gathering , of tribal and community leaders , which accepted his proposal to form a council to seek peace .
But the Taliban rebuffed the idea of talks , saying all foreign forces must first leave Afghanistan .
Karzai 's peace plan involves luring footsoldiers away from the battlefield with cash and job incentives while seeking reconciliation with senior militant leaders by offering them asylum in Muslim countries and striking their names off the UN blacklist .
Donor nations – most of them western countries – have pledged to provided tens of millions of dollars to help lure away Taliban fighters .
This year has been the bloodiest since 2001 , when US - led forces overthrew the Taliban in the weeks after the September 11 attacks on the US .
The conflict is turning into a political liability for the US president , Barack Obama , who wants to start withdrawing US troops from next July if conditions allow .
In the latest violence , police said a suicide bomber killed a deputy provincial governor and five others in eastern Afghanistan .
The bomber rammed a motorised rickshaw loaded with explosives into one of two vehicles in a convoy taking deputy governor Khazim Allayar to his office in Ghazni city .
Police said Allayar 's adult son , a nephew , a bodyguard and two civilians were also killed and a number of others were injured ."
2010-10-06,"There is a clear and pressing need to end the monumental folly of prosecuting a war in Afghanistan .
It is spreading in intensity into the tribal areas of Pakistan and could yet rattle a weak civilian government in Islamabad to bits .
To persuade themselves that they are prevailing , the US , Britain and their allies maintain the illusion that they are building the capacity of the Afghan state , when that claim is being routinely undermined by corrupt elections and a president in Hamid Karzai who packs his administration with his relatives .
Belief in the nation - building project has collapsed .
The bar of success is being lowered .
The war has become both a magnet for , and training ground of , no less than two generations of jihadis , each more determined than the last .
It is the rallying cause for terrorist acts against civilian targets across the world .
Enormous military resources are being devoted to fighting the Taliban on both sides of the border – there are 140,000 Pakistan military in the tribal areas alone .
Yet all that has been accomplished is a larger battlefield and a more intense battle .
The Pentagon 's initial optimism that a surge of US troops would push the Taliban out of Helmand and Kandahar has faded , even before troop levels have peaked .
Everyone knows that this conflict can only end in a negotiated solution , but no one yet can imagine it happening .
It is against this background that we reveal today that talks have been taking place with the Haqqani network , a group based in North Waziristan and one of the most feared insurgents in Afghanistan .
This is separate from the report in the Washington Post that Karzai has been holding secret high - level talks with the Quetta Shura , the Afghan Taliban organisation based in Pakistan , about a comprehensive settlement .
But taken together there is now credible evidence of a desire in Washington as well as in Kabul to address the leadership of the main Taliban groups , to reconcile the so‑called irreconcilables , and not rely on a policy of removing them .
It is not clear who is forcing whom to the negotiating table .
It is assumed that the Taliban are propelled by a surge of drone strikes and by the desire of an older generation of fighters who know the benefits of peace to negotiate a deal , before they lose control altogether to radical Islamists .
But too much also is unknown – how far these talks have gone , and whether indeed they present a viable alternative to the Taliban strategy of waiting the Americans out .
For there is a third and more potent enemy that the US faces .
It is chaos , the inability to stick to one course of action and to bend competing actors to that end .
The war could continue simply because its momentum is now unstoppable ."
2010-10-07,"Both the Afghan and US governments have recently made contact with the most fearsome insurgent group in Afghanistan , the Haqqani network , the Guardian has learned .
Hamid Karzai 's government held direct talks with senior members of the Haqqani clan over the summer , according to well - placed Pakistani and Arab sources .
The US contacts have been indirect , through a western intermediary , but have continued for more than a year .
The Afghan and US talks were described as extremely tentative .
The Haqqani network has a reputation for ruthlessness , even by the standards of the Afghan insurgency , and has the closest ties with al - Qaida .
But Kabul and Washington have come to the conclusion that they can not be excluded if an enduring peace settlement is to be reached .
A senior Pakistani official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said "" you would n't be wrong "" when asked whether talks involving Haqqani , Karzai and the US were taking place .
But he refused to comment further , citing the sensitivity of the matter .
Calls and emails soliciting comment from the US state department were unreturned by late last night .
A senior western official said the US now considers the Haqqani network to be more powerful than the Quetta Shura , the 15-man leadership council headed by the Taliban 's leader , Mullah Omar . ""
The Quetta Shura is still important but not as much as people thought two years ago .
Its prestige and impact have waned , and they are increasingly less important on the battlefield .
Now the military threat comes from the Haqqanis , "" the official said .
The twin poles of the insurgency are located at least 250 miles apart along the Durand Line , the lawless Pakistani border .
The Haqqanis , who come from Khost in Afghanistan , are anchored in the Pakistani tribal area of North Waziristan .
The Washington Post reported yesterday that there had been top - level contacts between Kabul and the Quetta Shura , but not the Haqqani network .
Kabul and the Haqqanis have also denied any contacts .
The CIA chief , Leon Panetta , said in June that he did not believe the group had any real desire for reconciliation .
However , the contacts were confirmed to the Guardian by western , Arab and Pakistani official sources , who all said the Haqqanis sense that a negotiated settlement is the most likely outcome of the conflict , which enters its 10th year today , and are anxious not to be excluded .
Speaking of Sirajuddin Haqqani , who has taken over military leadership of the Haqqani group from his ailing father , Jalaluddin , a diplomat involved in the discussions said : "" The ice has broken .
He realises he could be a nobody if he does n't enter the process . ""
Drawing a parallel with the Northern Irish peace process , the diplomat said : "" The Haqqanis know they have to make the transition from the IRA to Sinn Féin . ""
According to several sources , a Haqqani delegation , including Sirajuddin 's brother and uncle , visited Kabul accompanied by senior officers from the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) – the group 's sponsor since the start of the conflict – for talks with Afghan officials .
A diplomatic source familiar with the talks said the Haqqani side had been noncommittal . ""
Even though they were sitting opposite each other talking , they were saying : ' Imagine if we did have talks , what would be the political framework ? '
""
A source directly involved in the reconciliation process said there had also been a face - to - face meeting between Karzai and Sirajuddin Haqqani on the Afghan - Pakistan border in the spring , but this could not be confirmed .
A report by Al - Jazeera television to this effect in July was strenuously denied by both sides .
The indirect contacts with the Americans have been made through a non - governmental western intermediary , who has met Haqqani representatives in Pakistan several times in the past 18 months , and who has conveyed messages to and fro .
Different diplomatic sources gave different accounts of the Haqqanis ' readiness to take part in a preliminary dialogue .
One said the relentless targeting of the Haqqani network fighters and leaders by US drones had devastated morale .
"" There is war - weariness on both sides .
Not just in the west , "" the diplomat said .
Another said the announcement by the US president , Barack Obama , that the troop drawdown would begin next July , had in turn encouraged the Haqqanis to come forward . ""
That conveyed a message that the Americans would not be there for ever , and they definitely were in the market for talks , and that opened a door , "" the source said .
He predicted that talks with both the Haqqanis and the Quetta Shura would begin in earnest in December , after the winter snows cut the passes between Pakistan and Afghanistan and effectively end the fighting season .
In any future talks the critical demand from both Kabul and Washington would be for the Haqqanis to sever their ties to al - Qaida , whose leaders , including Osama bin Laden , are believed to be sheltering in the caves of North Waziristan .
A Pakistani official said yesterday that he believed the group was ready to make that step . ""
This is the end of the road for al - Qaida in Waziristan , "" the official said ."
2010-10-21,"More than a billion dollars worth of aid projects in Afghanistan will have to be cancelled by the end of the month if Hamid Karzai persists with his demand that all private security companies should be disbanded by the end of the year , according to figures seen by the Guardian .
Foreign contractors insist on private security companies to protect their staff , and warn that the presidential decree , first issued in August , will put workers in jeopardy .
Now figures presented by companies running aid projects to the US Embassy in Kabul show that the proposed revolution to the country 's security industry will "" severely handicap the counter - insurgency strategy "" in the country and "" put in jeopardy substantial humanitarian and development efforts "" .
The report , collated by Overseas Security Advisory Council , a group representing the private sector but which works under the auspices of the US State Department , offers the best available guess of the effect on development work by 59 organisations that work on US funded projects , including massive road - building programmes and agricultural support .
The estimates suggest that of a total of $ 5.1bn worth of US aid earmarked for spending by the 59 companies , 18 projects worth $ 1.4bn would have to be shut down , starting at the end of this month .
Four more projects worth $ 484 m would have to be almost completely closed down while other contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars would only continue on a much diminished scale .
The figures were presented to the US embassy earlier in the week by the concerned companies .
Karzai has long made clear his opposition to unpopular private security companies .
He announced in November that they should be disbanded by late 2011 , saying that only the Afghan army and police should have the right to carry weapons .
But there is widespread scepticism about his motives for suddenly bringing forward the deadline . ""
He needed something to get leverage on us after we started beating him up on [ the need to end government ] corruption , "" said one US official .
"" Security companies is perfect because he knows we ca n't function without them . ""
Other western diplomats have argued the decision was more a sign of the president 's chaotic style of decision - making that is largely unchecked by a strong civil service capable of querying policy decisions .
The US and the Nato International Security Assistance Forces ( ISAF ) have publicly endorsed the president 's desire to rid the country of security companies , but believe he is trying to implement it far too quickly and have been frantically lobbying for concessions .
A senior ISAF officer said that it would "" take years "" to fully withdraw private security guards from Afghanistan .
"" There is only so many police and they are already needed somewhere else , "" he said .
"" The people doing the job today are paid a much higher salary than the government can afford .
I do n't think they are the ones hanging out for that job . ""
David Petraeus , the commander of ISAF , has personally warned Karzai of the debilitating effect the move would have on the aid effort .
So far the lobbying has prompted Karzai to exempt companies that guard embassies , military installations and "" depots used by foreign forces "" .
But the large number of foreign aid contractors who insist on providing armed guards for their expat staff have not been exempted .
On Sunday Karzai 's office remained defiant , publishing a statement that called for all other private security firms to be "" considered as a serious threat against national security and Afghanistan 's sovereignty and shall , with no exception , go through the disbandment process "" .
"" The government needs to understand that time is running out , "" said one manager from a major implementing partner .
"" On 1 November all these companies will have to issue termination letters to local and international staff because it will take time to wind down projects and bring assets out of the country . ""
There are signs the government may consider allowing companies to remain operating on a case by case basis .
Today the interior ministry asked all private security companies to provide reasons why they should continue to exist – a move described as "" absurd "" by one contractor ."
2010-10-24,"Recent widely - reported contacts between senior Taliban and the Kabul government have little to do with a peace settlement and involve scarcely more than exchanges of cash and prisoners , diplomats and observers have told the Guardian .
They say contacts with the Taliban have been under way for several years and reflect how war is waged in Afghanistan , where talking and fighting at the same time are common .
But the encounters have been hyped as signs of a move towards peace as part of a misinformation campaign aimed at the Taliban leadership , or to reinforce the impression that Nato and Afghan forces are making strategic gains .
Anticipation of a breakthrough rose earlier this month after Nato officers and Afghan officials briefed journalists that there had been high - level contacts between President Hamid Karzai and senior Taliban members .
Karzai claimed to "" have had personal meetings with some Taliban leaders "" and has set up a high peace council with the aim of pursuing a political settlement .
Nato officials spoke of meetings with four Taliban commanders , including a top member of the movement claiming to express its "" collective will "" with the approval of its leader , Mullah Omar .
The US and Nato commander in Afghanistan , General David Petraeus , even said his forces had facilitated the talks by allowing Taliban officials to fly to the meetings in safety .
But according to officials briefed on the talks , there is , in the words of one source , "" less than meets the eye "" .
The Taliban member who flew to Kabul to meet Karzai was influential , but not a member of the Quetta Shura leadership council , and probably did not represent its views .
Karzai did not raise the prospect of power - sharing or division of territory , but rather sought to buy his Taliban interlocutors off one by one by offering cash .
In each case , the Taliban commanders asked for small amounts of money , gave no undertakings on future actions , and returned to their havens in Pakistan .
The New York Times today quoted unnamed officials as alleging the Karzai government was using a slush fund supplied by Iran to buy the loyalty of Taliban commanders , and to bribe members of the Afghan parliament as well as tribal elders .
According to one source , the Taliban participants also asked for the release of family members and friends from Afghan prisons .
Parallel contacts between Kabul and the Haqqani insurgent network , based in Pakistan 's North Waziristan tribal territory , are also reported to have been unproductive .
Commenting on the accounts , Michael Semple , a former UN and European envoy with a history of contacts with the Taliban , said : "" We know this kind of thing has been going on for a long time .
That is the way Karzai operates , but it 's also standard operating procedure for Afghanistan . ""
Semple , who is now at the Carr centre for human rights policy at Harvard University , said : "" It 's traditional for people on either side to develop linkages .
The enemy go to the other side and make tactical requests .
It 's not just money but also requests for brothers and cousins to be let out of jail .
Its a case of : give me a few bob and free my cousin . ""
He added that the fact the talks were being leaked so freely by Kabul and Nato suggested there was little substance to them . ""
If this were a serious process they would be guarding its confidentiality for dear life , "" he said .
Baryalai Helali , a member of the High Peace Council , said there had been contacts between the top of the Taliban and the government since 2002 .
For its part , the Taliban has vehemently denied the existence of any talks , distributing an email last week accusing Nato forces , "" their Afghan puppets and western media outlets "" of "" organised propaganda "" designed to make it "" appear as though mujahideen of the Islamic emirate were ready for negotiations and that they have made progress in that regard "" .
Wahid Mujda , a political analyst who served in a mid - ranking capacity in the Taliban government of the 1990s , said something was going on – but not the start of a serious peace process .
He suspected one of the men involved in the talks was Maulvi Abdul Kabir , a member of the Quetta Shura reportedly arrested in Pakistan in February . ""
Once you are arrested you no longer have any authority to talk on behalf of the Taliban , "" he said .
"" And the Taliban have been very consistent that they will never talk to what they regard as a puppet government and will only talk direct to the Americans .
It is very strange to me that there would be such a big change from Mullah Omar . ""
Alex Strick van Linschoten , an expert on the Taliban based in Kandahar , agreed .
"" People in conflict in Afghanistan will always extend contacts with each other .
It does n't mean peace is at hand , "" he said .
"" We are at the middle of the middle of this thing , not even the beginning of the end . ""
He suggested the reports of peace contacts were being stoked by Nato to create a favourable backdrop to the December Afghan strategy review in Washington , where the Obama administration will assess progress and make decisions on US commitments in Afghanistan .
Nato officials pointed out they had been cautious in describing the contacts and had been sceptical over claims by Taliban participants to represent the Quetta Shura or Mullah Omar .
One official , however , admitted one reason the contacts had received so much publicity was an attempt to confuse Taliban leaders : "" This is about throwing sand in their ears , "" the official said ."
2010-10-25,"Hamid Karzai has admitted that his chief of staff collects "" bags of money "" , containing hundreds of thousands of euros , from the Iranian government each year .
The Afghan president told a press conference that the cash was used to pay his office expenses and that he was happy to take large sums from Iran , Afghanistan 's most important ally and the main regional enemy of the US . ""
This is nothing hidden , "" Karzai said .
"" We are grateful for Iranian help in this regard .
The United States is doing the same thing .
They 're providing cash to some of our offices . ""
He said that once or twice a year Iran provided as much as € 700,000 ( £ 625,000 ) and that the money was handled by Umar Daudzai , the powerful chief of staff who is known for his anti - western views .
The New York Times reported on Sunday that at the end of an official visit by Karzai to Iran , Daudzai was handed bags of cash by an Iranian official as he waited to board the presidential plane .
Karzai 's admission over Iran 's role at the heart of the Afghan administration clears up a long - standing mystery surrounding the funding of his office .
It had long been assumed Karzai had access to a sizeable slush fund because of his habit of disbursing money , cars and other gifts to political allies and others considered due awards .
Iran has long sought influence inside Afghanistan .
Karzai has caused embarrassment in Washington by inviting Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to Kabul , where the leader then launched a public tirade against US policy and called for American troops to withdraw .
Karzai insisted , however , that there was nothing untoward about the Iranian payments .
"" They want good relations in return … Afghanistan and Iran have neighbourly relations , "" he said .
"" We have also asked lots of things in return in this relationship …
so it 's a relationship between neighbours .
It will go on and we 'll continue to ask for cash help from Iran . ""
White House spokesman Bill Burton said the international community should have "" every reason to be concerned about Iran trying to have a negative influence on Afghanistan . ""
Asked about Karzai 's assertion that the United States had also in the past provided cash in bags , another White House spokesman PJ Crowley said this had happened but was not taking place now . ""
Going back a number of years , because of the nature of the Afghan financial system , there have been times where assistance has come into Afghanistan in the form of cash , "" Crowley said .
"" That 's not the form that our assistance takes today . ""
During his press conference , held with Emomali Rahmon , the the president of neighbouring Tajikistan , Karzai also insisted on the closure of all private security companies which he said were responsible for "" the deaths of Afghan children "" and caused "" blasts and terrorism "" ."
2010-11-02,"One year ago Hamid Karzai was declared re - elected as president of Afghanistan , ending an election that had no legitimacy in the eyes of ordinary Afghans .
The presidential election last year was a fraud , with ballot stuffing , vote buying and massive corruption reported by the world 's media .
Even if the independent election commission had not cancelled the planned run - off between Karzai and his main challenger , Abdullah Abdullah , it would have represented only a choice of the "" same donkey with a new saddle "" .
People had no incentive to participate as they knew that both main candidates would bring nothing positive for Afghan people .
Karzai had lost his popularity way before the 2009 election .
This was due to the ever increasing corruption of the government , the never - ending crimes of the many fundamentalists and warlords in his regime , and the financial scandals and corruption of his brothers .
In Kandahar people even started calling Ahmed Wali Karzai the "" little Bush "" , after the hated US president .
The vast majority of Afghans have lost all hope in Karzai .
For us his words and actions have no value , and that includes his latest "" peace negotiations "" and other measures .
Including killers like Mullah Omar and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the government is not about negotiating for peace , but completing the decades - old circle of warlordism and fundamentalism .
It 's important to say that these so - called elections have n't damaged Afghanistan as much as the US and its Nato allies have , with their bombing and occupation .
Wikileaks has exposed some of the truth about the civilian toll of this war against the Afghan and Iraqi peoples .
Afghans hold the US and Nato , and their puppet Karzai , responsible for these war crimes .
They claim to fight terrorism , but in fact they are the biggest terrorists in the eyes of our people because of their crimes and brutalities .
Unfortunately the Afghan people are not yet strong enough to drive out the US , overthrow the mafia government of Karzai and bring an end to the crimes of the Taliban and other fundamentalists .
Our history proves that this resistance to occupation will continue until we have won our freedom .
Until both the US and the fundamentalists – of both the Northern Alliance and Taliban brands – are driven out of power in Afghanistan , we can not see a bright future .
It is now more than five years since I was elected to the Afghan parliament .
My experience of this "" democratic process "" was to see my microphone cut off , and to be threatened with death by other MPs – many of whom teamed up to remove me illegally from my seat .
My case alone is enough to prove that women 's rights in Afghanistan have not truly been safeguarded – our situation was just invoked to justify the war .
In fact , it 's important to remember another document that Wikileaks exposed earlier this year : a CIA paper assessing western public opinion on the war that recommended using "" testimonials by Afghan women "" expressing fear about a Taliban takeover in the event of Nato pulling out .
A Time cover story featuring the disfigured Bibi Aisha was a clear example of using the plight of women as war propaganda .
The headline – "" What happens if we leave Afghanistan "" – could have , or should have , been "" What happens while we are in Afghanistan "" , because crimes of mutilation , rape and murder against women are commonplace today .
Many warlords and commanders aligned with Nato and Karzai carry out their sexist , misogynist crimes with impunity .
Time could , for example , have done a cover story condemning the law signed by Karzai in 2009 that legalised crimes against Shia women , or about the shocking levels of women committing suicide by self - immolation .
We had another so - called parliamentary election in September , but I chose not to run .
Any hope I had for using the ballot box to achieve change in Afghanistan is gone .
Like last year 's presidential vote , September 's election was full of the buying and selling of votes – one province , Paktika , reported a turnout of 626 % .
This sort of thing is the reason elections in Afghanistan long ago became a bad joke .
Tomorrow there is an election in the US , and it is now two years since Barack Obama was elected president .
His surge of troops has brought only a surge of violence , and his expansion of the war into Pakistan has claimed many innocent lives .
Obama promised "" hope "" and "" change "" , but Afghans have seen only change for the worse .
Here he is now seen as a "" second Bush "" .
The only change that can make us hopeful about the future is the strengthening and expansion of a national anti - fundamentalist and democracy - loving movement .
Such a movement can be built only by Afghans .
And while we want the world 's support and solidarity , we neither need nor want Nato 's occupying forces ."
2010-11-15,"The White House and the head of Nato have defended US tactics against the Taliban after the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , again angered Washington by publicly criticising military operations and calling for a reduction in the number of troops on the ground .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , threw her support behind targeted assaults and raids against Taliban fighters after Karzai told the Washington Post that they increase Afghan civilians ' hostility to coalition forces and help the insurgents .
Karzai said : "" The time has come to reduce military operations [ and ] boots in Afghanistan … to reduce the intrusiveness into the daily Afghan life . ""
Nato 's military commander in Afghanistan , General David Petraeus , responded to Karzai 's demands by warning that his criticisms threaten to undermine the war and could make Petraeus 's position "" untenable "" , the Post reported .
Clinton today supported Petraeus , saying that while the US shares some of Karzai 's concerns about the toll of raids on civilians , the strategy is right .
"" We believe that the use of intelligence driven , precision , targeted operations against high - value insurgents and their networks is a key component of our comprehensive civilian - military operations , "" she said .
The head of Nato , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , also backed US military tactics days before Barack Obama , other Nato leaders and Karzai are to meet in Lisbon to map out a gradual shift in security responsibility from foreign troops to Afghan forces , beginning next year .
The US said it expects the plan to confirm that Nato forces will remain to carry out combat missions until 2014 .
Rasmussen said that the military assault against the Taliban must continue in order to force them to the negotiating table : "" I consider it of utmost importance to continue our military operations because it is the increasing military pressure on the Taliban and the Taliban leadership that has stimulated the reconciliation talks .
"" I ca n't say I agree with everything President Karzai has stated on all issues , but we also have to accept that he is the elected president of the country and of course he can express his views as he wishes .
"" The Afghan government tried to undo some of the damage caused by Karzai 's interview , the latest in a series of public disagreements with the Americans , who have come to view him as erratic .
Karzai 's spokesman , Waheed Omar , said that the full text showed that the Afghan president was "" very clear about his confidence in General Petraeus "" .
He said that Karzai was not making a "" critique "" of the overall strategy in Afghanistan , and that he had been speaking in the context of the transition plan , which calls for Afghan forces to gradually take the leading role in operations .
He said that the international coalition understood the government 's "" traditional and cultural sensitivities "" over raids on homes by foreign soldiers .
Nato officials have been irritated by the quotes because Afghan forces are involved in night raids –
something the government has been lobbying for years for .
One diplomat described Karzai 's remarks as "" astounding and breathtaking "" .
He said : "" Is it right to undermine the strategy of your partner so directly and fundamentally in public without telling him first ? ""
Others have reacted with resignation given Karzai 's history of contentious comments .
said one aAnother official said : "" It is not helpful a few days before Lisbon .
But a reliable partner in Kabul is a registered trademark , not an actual reality .
"" Obama 's special representative , Richard Holbrooke , reiterated that while some US troops will be pulled out of Afghanistan next year , the combat mission will go on at least until 2014 .
"" We do not have an exit strategy but a transition strategy , "" Holbrooke said , adding that "" 2014 is not the end of international presence in Afghanistan [ but ] to be sure there will be some drawdown [ of troops ] in July next year .
The size and pace will be decided by the president . ""
The Taliban leader , Mullah Mohammad Omar , said that the insurgents had no intention of negotiating with Karzai 's government , despite claims that the two sides are already talking .
He said the Taliban would escalate their attacks on Nato forces to "" compel the enemy to come out from their hideouts and then crush them through tactical raids "" ."
2010-11-18,"Afghanistan The "" war on terror "" and the Taliban will dominate Saturday morning in Lisbon , with Nato leaders joined by Hamid Karzai , government figures of all 50 countries engaged in the Afghan campaign , and Ban Ki - moon , the UN chief .
Exit strategy and transition to Afghan ownership are the key topics .
David Cameron said this week 2015 was a "" clear deadline "" for the withdrawal of UK troops .
The aim is to try to discern "" a light at the end of the tunnel "" , with leaders seeking to chart a transition plan being effected from next summer and aiming for a main evacuation of foreign forces by 2014 - 15 .
The idea is to name as soon as possible which of Afghanistan 's 39 provinces are ready to be handed over to the Afghan National Army and to civil governorship .
There is a risk of humiliation in naming areas ripe for Afghan government and decisions later being reversed .
Also , Nato remains short of 2,000 trainers for the Afghan army , hurting the exit strategy .
Russia Barack Obama 's campaign to "" reset "" relations with Moscow may be set back by his mid - term election battering and its impact on arms control with the Russians .
But President Dmitry Medvedev will also be in Lisbon for a Russia - Nato summit amid signs of a warming .
The US and Germans are keen to rope the Russians into revised missile shield plans in Europe .
Eastern Europe , perennially wary of the Russians , has been given security assurances in return for being nicer to Moscow .
The prospect of a US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan appears to be encouraging Moscow to see that US success could be in Russia 's interest .
The Russians are pledging more help on allied transit in and out of Afghanistan , co - operation on countering the heroin trade , and on training .
There could be a short - term boost to Russia - west relations .
Longer - term problems remain .
The Europeans Twenty - one of the EU 's 27 countries are in Nato , yet the two organisations occupy parallel universes in Brussels .
It 's a hardy perennial , Nato - EU frictions in places from Kosovo to Afghanistan , as well as at the policy and strategy level .
Catherine Ashton , EU foreign policy chief , wrote to Nato chief , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , this week pledging fresh efforts to do something about it .
The biggest problem is ( in Nato ) Turkey and ( in EU ) Cyprus .
Both the union and alliance have imported the Cyprus dispute to paralysing effect .
The Turks make demands on the EU and veto Nato collaboration , while the Greek Cypriots block the EU from working with Turkey and Nato .
No breakthrough expected .
All for one and one for all Nato 's core mission of mutual defence in Europe has been fraying since the end of the cold war and because of ever more ambitious and expensive expeditionary campaigns in the Balkans and Asia .
The former Soviet captive states of central and eastern Europe have been complaining loudly about the erosion of Article 5 security guarantees , given the rise of Vladimir Putin 's Russia and since cyber - attacks on Estonia in 2007 and the Russian war in Georgia in 2008 .
The new Nato concept will re - emphasise Article 5 and mutual defence .
The east Europeans are a bit more relaxed ."
2010-11-20,"Nato leaders today set a deadline of the end of 2014 for a halt to combat operations in Afghanistan , agreeing on an exit strategy to extricate the vast majority of the 138,000 international troops waging an increasingly unpopular war .
A summit of Nato leaders in Lisbon , attended by Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , and Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary general , agreed on a "" transition strategy "" for Afghanistan which is to phase in the handover of the country 's provinces to Afghan security forces from next year , completing the shift within four years .
But while David Cameron and his ministers insisted that 2015 was a "" clear deadline "" for an end to UK combat operations and the pullout of most British forces , Nato and UN leaders were much more guarded .
"" We will not transition until our partners are ready , "" said Anders Fogh Rasmussen , the Nato secretary general .
"" We will stay to finish the job ...
The process must be conditions - based , not calendar - based .
We have to make sure we do n't leave Afghanistan prematurely . ""
Ban added : "" We must be guided by reality , not schedules . ""
Nato leaders stressed that nine years into the war on the Taliban and al - Qaida , things were going well despite the high level of casualties .
Some 650 coalition forces have been killed this year , by far the highest rate of deaths since the war began in late 2001 – 40 % up on last year and double the rate of two years ago .
Karzai used the meeting with Obama and western leaders to complain about night raids on Afghan homes and villages and about civilians deaths from US air attacks .
Despite the friction between Karzai and the Americans , sources said that Obama was sympathetic and supportive of the Afghan leader .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , by contrast , told Karzai pointedly that the Nato attacks had to continue in order to produce results .
"" We all want to reduce civilian casualties , but we need to keep the pressure on , "" she told the summit , according to witnesses .
"" Our publics would be concerned to learn that our troops are not welcomed by the Afghan people . ""
Nato leaders emphasised that Afghan army and police forces are now at a level of more than 260,000 , growing to more than 300,000 next year and that the international forces will be able to gradually pull out , leaving behind training missions which will not engage in combat ."
2010-11-24,"Afghan officials released the results of parliamentary elections today , but the long - awaited announcement appeared to satisfy no one , with protesters blocking roads around the country and the attorney general announcing an investigation into alleged widespread corruption by electoral authorities .
There was a stony silence from President Hamid Karzai , who fears the electoral hammering of the majority Pashtun community could worsen ethnic tensions .
More than two months after Afghans went to the polls , the independent election commission ( IEC ) announced results for all but one of the country 's provinces and declared what was only the second democratic contest for parliament in the country 's history as the vote a "" major success "" .
The IEC disqualified 24 preliminary winners for irregularities – almost one in 10 of the contenders for the 249 seats in parliament .
It also invalidated some 1.3 m of the 5.6 m votes cast .
Protesters and failed candidates took to the streets carrying banners to demand the election be annulled .
Roads were blocked in some parts of the country .
The attorney general , Mohammad Ishaq Alako , a Karzai appointee , is threatening to investigate the IEC , alleging that commissioners attended meetings in Dubai where they accepted bribes to favour some candidates .
The "" decision about the Afghan election has been made in Dubai and in Kabul 's foreign exchange market "" , he said on national television .
The opposition leader , Abdullah Abdullah , said that the election had been deeply flawed and that some supporters had been unfairly disqualified .
The political complexion of the next parliament is still unclear .
Abdullah said he believed that he would eventually lead a coalition of around 90 MPs – a huge step forward in forging a united front against the president .
Unlike the last parliament , only a minority of MPs will be Pashtuns , who have traditionally held sway in Afghanistan , will make up only a minority of MPs .
The prospect of disenfranchisement among Pashtuns , who also account for the vast majority of Taliban members , is a cause of deep concern for Karzai .
Diplomats say he put great pressure on the IEC to amend the results , and Abdullah echoed concerns made over recent weeks the president might simply refuse to recognise the results .
With both the US embassy and the European Union expressing satisfaction with the outcome , however , it appeared unlikely that Karzai would now risk triggering a constitutional crisis by refusing to inaugurate parliament .
But his reaction may depend on the outcome in Ghazni province – the only constituency for which final results have not been released .
The Ghazni result is intensely controversial because , although a Pashtun majority province , insecurity and fraud ensured that all of the 11 seats were wonby ethnic Hazara candidates , according to preliminary results .
Abdullah has warned that the province 's final results should be decided only on numerical grounds and there should be no political interference ."
2010-11-26,"Peace talks conducted with an impostor who posed as a Taliban leader , and which led to a meeting with Hamid Karzai in Kabul and thousands of dollars in "" goodwill payments "" , were started by the Afghan government and approved by the former American commander , Stanley McChrystal , the Guardian has learned .
This account sharply contradicts claims made by the Afghan presidency , which has put the entire blame on Britain , apparently supported privately by US officials .
In fact , the overriding desire to find a negotiated end to the conflict , particularly on the part of David Cameron , appears to have generated credulity on all sides , and led to an embarrassing debacle that has lessened trust and set back hopes of meaningful negotiations in the near future .
Sources close to the contacts said the impostor , who claimed to be Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour , the Taliban 's deputy leader , was originally introduced by an insurgent commander in Kandahar to the then Afghan interior minister , Hanif Atmar .
This Taliban commander , Muhammad Aminullah , is close to the movement 's overall leader , Mullah Omar , and has led some of the fiercest Taliban fighting in the Zhari and Panjwai districts of Kandahar province .
When he was picked up and held in a Nato raid in January this year , the Afghan government complained that he was a longstanding channel of Atmar 's to the Taliban , and asked for him to be freed .
In return , Aminullah offered contacts with Mansour , suggesting he might be open to political talks .
The deal was approved by McChrystal , then the commander of Nato and US forces in Afghanistan , and a supporter of reconciliation efforts .
McChrystal asked MI6 to develop the contacts , rather than go to the CIA , which was not empowered by the necessary White House directive to enter into direct talks with Taliban officials .
The absence of such a "" presidential finding "" is seen by many diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic as an obstacle to progress towards a political settlement .
At this point , MI6 , delighted to have been given the mission , appears to have got carried away with enthusiasm for the "" breakthrough "" , and brushed aside doubts raised by both US and British officials about "" Mansour 's "" credibility . ""
Our friends got very excited , "" one official involved in the discussions recalled .
"" I remember everyone being very pompous and secretive about this . ""
McChrystal 's successor , Gen David Petraeus , is believed to have had doubts about Mansour 's identity , but ultimately encouraged the contacts and discreetly publicised them .
Last night
the head of the US military , Admiral Mike Mullen said the US had suspected the self - described Taliban leader was an imposter .
"" There were very early initial suspicions .
And it took a little while to verify who he was or who he was n't .
And , in fact , it turns out he was n't the guy he was claiming he should be . ""
After the coalition took office in May , both Cameron and William Hague were briefed about the talks with Mansour .
The prime minister 's eagerness to pursue a negotiated settlement contributed to an echo chamber in which more cautious voices were drowned out .
A series of meetings at a Nato military base in Kandahar culminated in the supposed Taliban leader being flown to Kabul in a British military plane to meet Karzai just over three months ago .
In that meeting , and at some of the preliminary meetings , the impostor ( reported by the Washington Post , citing Afghan intelligence , to be a grocer from Quetta ) , was given tens of thousands of dollars as a reward for attending and as encouragement to develop the dialogue .
It is unclear how much of that money was paid by Britain and how much by Karzai , who keeps his own fund , partially financed by Iran , for such purposes .
The US has insisted no American money was used .
It was at the meeting with Karzai that "" Mansour 's "" identity was definitively challenged , leading to his unmasking earlier this week .
McChrystal , who has retired from the US army , could not be reached for comment and Atmar , who was in London this week , did not reply to emails seeking comment .
Interviewed in today 's Washington Post , Karzai 's chief of staff , Mohammad Umer Daudzai , squarely blamed the British for the fiasco . ""
This shows that this process should be Afghan - led and fully Afghanised , "" Daudzai said .
"" The last lesson we draw from this : international partners should not get excited so quickly with those kind of things … Afghans know this business , how to handle it . ""
Another Afghan official echoed that account , telling the Guardian : "" Generally speaking , British intelligence has been the main director and architect of the peace plan ; and in this particular case the mediators were British . ""
The official also blamed the Pakistani intelligence agency , the ISI , which he said introduced the fraud to MI6 .
The Guardian , however , could find no confirmation of any role played by the ISI , which is frequently blamed for setbacks by the Kabul government .
British intelligence is conducting an inquiry into the episode , in part to uncover the motive .
One theory is that it was an exercise in kite - flying by the Taliban , to discover what Kabul and the British were offering , without risking a senior figure in the movement .
Taliban leaders have been wary about attending meetings with would - be mediators , fearing they are on a Nato hit - list , known as the Joint Priority Effects List .
A Nato source said : "" If you look at it from their point of view , as soon as they turn up for a meeting , they give us an eight - digit map reference of where they are .
This , on the other hand , is no risk . """
2010-11-26,"President Hamid Karzai 's chief of staff has joined US officials in blaming Britain for an embarrassing gaffe in which an impostor met Afghan and Nato officials before it was discovered he was not the Taliban leader they thought he was .
It was revealed this week that the impostor – understood to be a shopkeeper from Quetta in Pakistan – was masquerading as Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour , the second highest ranking official in the Taliban .
He attended three meetings in Kabul .
Karzai 's aide , Mohammad Umer Daudzai , has accused British authorities of bringing the man to the presidential palace in July or August and said the US and Britain should stay out of delicate negotiations with the Afghan insurgents . ""
This shows that this process should be Afghan - led and fully ' Afghanised ' , "" Daudzai said , according to the Washington Post today . ""
The last lesson we draw from this : international partners should not get excited so quickly with those kind of things … Afghans know this business , how to handle it .
We handle it with care , we handle it with a result - based approach , with very less damage to all the other processes . ""
Daudzai said Afghan authorities first made contact with a man claiming to be a representative of Mansour six to eight months ago .
He was ready to arrange peace talks , and said Mansour wanted a timeline for foreign troop withdrawal and a constitutional change to incorporate Islamic law .
Karzai 's officials , Daudzai said , decided not to meet Mansour 's associate "" because he was unknown , very junior "" .
The British took over , he said , and used that contact to arrange for Mansour to visit Kabul .
Daudzai said British representatives , but not Americans , were at the meeting with Karzai .
According to the Post , Daudzai said the impostor may have been sent by Pakistan 's spy agency to "" test the system "" , but "" we ca n't say for sure "" .
Britain and other European countries "" are in haste "" to move peace talks with the Taliban forward , perhaps to speed up their troops ' departure , he said , arguing that Afghanistan 's 70-member peace council , which includes former Taliban officials , should be leading the process .
A former senior Afghan official involved in the case told the paper the British had provided logistical help to bring Mansour to Kabul , and characterised Daudzai as making political attack on the west when the Afghans were responsible for the meeting .
He said public discussion of the case put at risk the life of the man who attended the meeting , as well as those of Afghan agents in Pakistan , and had "" ruined the entire process "" . ""
And if he 's not the person – and there has never been evidence produced that he is not that person – then they jumped to a conclusion before looking at the evidence , "" the official said , adding that the man who attended the meeting passed identification screening tests with 95 % certainty .
The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd reported yesterday that people familiar with the con , as she described it , said that "" the British spent a year developing the fake Taliban leader as a source "" , adding that General David Petraeus , the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan , reportedly was "" buying into it "" .
Officials who insisted on remaining anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter confirmed that Britain was being held responsible for the episode .
There was said to be "" some truth "" in the US reports .
The impostor is understood to have been paid a large sum in the hope that he would remain in the talks .
Since Mansour is a high - profile Taliban leader , foreign and Afghan officials came to suspect anything was wrong only when an Afghan negotiator who had met Mansour said he did not recognise the man at the talks .
Separately , General Sir David Richards , the head of Britain 's armed forces , has said in an article that former warlords and their private militias have a "" positive role "" to play in Afghanistan 's future . ""
Many Afghan warlords have transformed themselves into businessmen , and many of them are well connected in the political world , "" he said .
"" Curbing the excesses of these powerbrokers is essential .
At the same time , however , the stability they and their private militias offer can be utilised for the good of Afghanistan . ""
Richards co - authored the article , for the US journal Foreign Affairs , with Greg Mills , a former adviser to Afghan forces in Kabul and now the head of the Brenthurst Foundation , a South Africa - based thinktank set up by the Oppenheimer family ."
2010-11-30,"Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , has been sheltering a Pakistani rebel for several years , much to the annoyance of Pakistan 's generals , US embassy cables show .
Brahamdagh Bugti , a leader of the nationalist insurgency in Balochistan province , emerges as a pawn in often stormy relations between Kabul and Islamabad that are spiced with intrigue and failed American efforts to broker a solution .
A stream of Pakistani demands for Bugti 's return are stonewalled by Karzai ; Bugti is accused of kidnapping a senior UN official ; and the Islamabad CIA station chief is roped into an initiative to move Bugti to Ireland that turns out to be based on a false promise .
Bugti 's case was a "" neuralgic "" one for Pakistani generals , Americans believed .
The Bugtis are at the forefront of a rebellion that seeks greater economic and political autonomy for Balochistan , Pakistan 's largest but least developed province .
The 20-something rebel fled Pakistan in 2006 after surviving a military assault that killed his grandfather , Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti .
Since then Pakistani generals have frequently accused Kabul of secretly sheltering the young rebel .
In 2007 , General Pervez Musharraf said Bugti was "" enjoying freedom of movement to commute between Kabul and Kandahar , raising money and planning operations against Pakistani security forces "" .
When the US assistant secretary of state , Richard Boucher , said Karzai had promised that nobody would be allowed to use Afghan territory to attack Pakistan , Musharraf replied : "" That 's bullshit . ""
The controversy touches on one of the Pakistani military 's core fears : that India could use Afghan - based proxy forces to foment upheaval in Pakistan .
In 2007 Musharraf said he had "" ample proof "" of Indian and Afghan support for Bugti ; the prime minister , Shaukat Aziz , said Bugti had travelled to Delhi on a fake Afghan passport .
American analysis suggests the fear of Indian meddling helps explain Pakistan 's support for militant proxies such as the Afghan Taliban ; a view supported by a veiled threat Musharraf issued through a US diplomat .
"" If India wants to continue , let 's see what our options will be , "" he reportedly said .
Karzai , meanwhile , has refused to bend to Pakistani demands to surrender Bugti , accusing Islamabad of using the issue to deflect attention from its support of the Taliban . ""
Fomenting uprising does not make one a terrorist , "" he said in one meeting before asking US officials to stop taking notes because the matter was "" too sensitive "" .
In public , Afghan officials have consistently denied sheltering Bugti , but in a meeting with a senior UN official in February 2009 , Karzai "" finally admitted that Brahamdagh Bugti was in Kabul "" , the cables recorded .
The admission followed the kidnapping of a senior American UN official , John Solecki , in Balochistan .
After Solecki was snatched from Quetta , Balochistan 's capital , in early February , Pakistan 's army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , told the US he had phone intercepts that proved Bugti had orchestrated the kidnapping .
On 15 February , the US asked the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , to call Karzai , urging him to speak with Bugti and have Solecki released .
Karzai agreed , but said he doubted Bugti was involved .
US officials later complained that Karzai was blocking American contact with the rebel .
Solecki was released on 4 April in Balochistan .
Speaking to the Guardian by phone later that year , Bugti denied any role in the kidnapping , but admitted he was leading the fight against Pakistan 's army . ""
We want ownership of our own resources , our land , our coastal belt – nothing else , "" he said .
"" We want to solve this problem politically ; nobody wants to use the gun .
But because of what is happening the armed struggle is necessary . ""
Bugti declined to say where he was speaking from .
Bugti supporters say he is under tight Pakistani surveillance in Kabul and so , fearing for his life , they tried to move him to safer exile last December , the cables showed .
In Islamabad , one of Bugti 's uncles told US and UN officials that the "" deputy prime minister "" of Ireland had unofficially agreed to grant Bugti asylum .
This information triggered a meeting between a senior UN official and the US ambassador .
Subsequently the CIA station chief met with the head of Pakistan 's intelligence service ( ISI ) , General Shuja Pasha , to discuss the matter .
But Pasha blocked the initiative , saying Bugti should be forced to "" return to Pakistan to stand trial for his crimes "" , and the US and UN dropped the idea . ""
While getting Bugti out of Afghanistan is still a good idea , we do not believe UNHCR should be involved , "" the cable noted , referring to the UN refugee agency .
However , the entire scheme may have been based on nothing .
The uncle told the Guardian he had never claimed to have secured asylum for his nephew in Ireland . ""
This is news to me , "" he said .
"" I have no knowledge or information about this . ""
The substantial , if publicly underplayed , US strategic interest in Balochistan is reflected in the number of cables on the province .
Balochistan contains vast and largely untapped mineral resources , Taliban training camps , and is a major route for US military supplies being trucked into Afghanistan , second only to the Khyber Pass .
Balochistan is also home to a secretive desert airstrip used by the CIA to launch drone attacks on al - Qaida and Taliban targets in the tribal belt .
By removing Bugti from Afghanistan US officials believe they could remove an "" irritant "" in Pakistan - Afghanistan relations .
They also fear he could be traded against other militants of greater interest .
Last February , after the arrest of the senior Taliban leader Mullah Barader in Karachi , US diplomats said to "" watch out for consideration of some type of exchange of Barader with Bugti "" .
But Barader remains in Pakistani custody and Bugti may no longer be in Afghanistan .
A senior western official in Islamabad said the rebel had applied for asylum in France , which was refused , and in Norway , where the application was pending .
A senior UN official said Bugti was sheltering in the United Arab Emirates ; a human rights official said he sometimes travels to Geneva .
Also , the diplomats said , Pakistan 's military chiefs – Kayani and Pasha – would be reluctant to lose a "" huge potential propaganda pawn in Barader "" .
The cable said that while Bugti may be a core issue at some political level , the "" truths Barader could tell about ISI not to mention a host of other Pakistani notables , likely outweigh any potential wins in bringing Bugti to Pakistani justice "" .
The allegations appear to be accurate .
In a January 2007 meeting with assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher , Karzai said that more than 200 Bugtis had fled Pakistan into Afghanistan .
He had advised them to seek asylum with the UN but many were frightened and had gone into hiding ."
2010-12-02,"He may be vital to western plans in Afghanistan but Hamid Karzai is regularly described by frustrated diplomats and foreign statesmen as erratic , emotional and prone to believing paranoid conspiracy theories .
On some occasions Karzai 's own ministers accuse him of complicity in criminal activity , including ordering the physical intimidation of the top official in charge of leading negotiations with the Taliban .
In memos back to Washington , released by WikiLeaks , the current US ambassador , Karl Eikenberry , adopted a particularly weary tone when describing often bizarre meetings with the mercurial president .
In one in 2009 , Karzai argued that the US intended to "" divide Pakistan and weaken Afghanistan in order to pursue its fight against terrorist groups "" ; and suggested the US and Iran were working together to support his main political rival in the presidential elections .
Eikenberry "" pushed back hard "" against Karzai 's claim in what appears to have been a heated exchange .
Eikenberry concluded it was unlikely Karzai would ever break his habit of blaming the US and its allies for Afghanistan 's troubles and not addressing his own shortcomings . ""
Indeed his inability to grasp the most rudimentary principles of state - building and his deep seated insecurity as a leader combine to make any admission of fault unlikely , in turn confounding our best efforts to find in Karzai a responsible partner . ""
Eikenberry identified two competing personalities in Karzai . ""
The first is a paranoid and weak individual unfamiliar with the basics of nation - building and overly self - conscious that his time in the spotlight of glowing reviews from the international community has passed .
The other is that of an ever - shrewd politician who sees himself as a nationalist hero who can save the country from being divided by the decentralisation - focused agenda of Abdullah [ Karzai 's main rival in the 2009 election ] . ""
Omar Zakhilwal , the much respected finance minister , told the Americans Karzai was "" an extremely weak man who did not listen to facts but was instead easily swayed by anyone who came to report even the most bizarre stories or plots against him "" .
He said an "" inner circle "" of top ministers had developed a system to work together to influence Karzai when he started "" going astray on such matters "" .
Overall , "" Karzai is at the centre of the governance challenge "" , says a briefing paper written by the embassy for Robert Gates , the US secretary of defence , in late 2008 .
"" He has failed to overcome his fundamental leadership deficiencies in decisiveness and in confidence to delegate authority to competent subordinates .
The result : a cycle of overwork / fatigue / indecision on the part of Karzai , and gridlock and a sense of drift among senior officials on nearly all critical policy decisions . ""
International statesmen who meet Karzai occasionally have also expressed concerns .
Nursultan Nazarbayev , the president of Kazakhstan , said in a meeting with General David Petraeus last year : "" Karzai is weak , but it 's better to keep him on . ""
In a conversation with John McCain in 2008 , David Cameron said that "" each year he had the sense Karzai 's sphere of influence was shrinking "" .
Relations between Karzai and the British have long been strained .
The cables identify the problem as a fundamental disagreement between the two sides about how best to pacify Helmand .
For Karzai the solution was to "" bring the tribes to our side "" by appointing a corrupt but powerful tribal bigwig as governor .
The UK , on the other hand , believed clean and effective local government was the answer .
On several occasions the British thwarted Karzai 's plan to replace Gulab Mangal – the technocratic governor of Helmand praised to the skies by the US and UK – with Sher Mohammad Akhundzada , a leader of the Alizai tribe who served as governor of the province from 2001 to 2005 .
Once Gordon Brown had to tell Karzai that "" Akhundzada was not an acceptable alternative , given his history of corruption and involvement in drug trafficking "" and that Karzai was being deceived about the state of Helmand by scheming palace advisers .
British opposition created more recriminations , with a bitter Karzai telling a district governor that Helmand "" is not part of my administration "" but is "" controlled by foreigners "" .
The cables reveal that Karzai first tried to reinstate Akhundzada , – described as a "" known warlord and criminal "" – three months after the appointment of Mangal in March 2008 .
There was another effort in 2009 when Karzai argued that gaining the support of Akhundzada 's Alizai tribe was key to gaining stability in Helmand 's most troubled districts , including Sangin and Musa Qala .
Karzai argued with the US that it was better to have "" a bad guy on your side "" rather than him "" working for the Taliban "" .
But in its analysis the US embassy said a "" key underlying calculation "" of Karzai 's was that Akhundzada could turn out his Alizai tribe to vote for the president in the 2009 election .
There are signs that the UK worried about Karzai 's lack of public appreciation for the British effort .
In November 2008 David Miliband was recorded asking Karzai to write "" an open letter to the British people "" designed to reassure the UK public about the "" Afghan project "" .
Frustration with the Karzai family occasionally bubbles over among diplomats .
The Canadian ambassador William Crosbie told his US counterpart in February that they must be "" prepared for a confrontation with Karzai "" to prevent the rampant fraud that wrecked the presidential elections happening again in this year 's parliamentary poll .
He said Canada would demand that the "" international community ... stand up for the silent majority or be blamed for letting Karzai and his family establish across the country the system of patronage and control that exists in Kandahar "" .
But perhaps the most damning accounts of Karzai 's style of governing are from the president 's close colleagues .
In 2009 Umar Daudzai , Karzai 's chief of staff , told the Americans he was "" ashamed "" of an incident in which Karzai pardoned five border policemen who had been caught transporting 124 kg of heroin in an official vehicle .
The episode sent relations between Karzai and Washington into one of its periodic lows , with many assuming that Karzai had freed the men because their extended family had contributed to his re - election campaign .
Speaking generally about the release of drug traffickers , Mohammad Daud , deputy minister of interior with responsibility for tackling illegal drugs , is quoted in a cable as telling assistant US ambassador Anthony Wayne that he had learned "" some members of the president 's family had been receiving money from those seeking the pardon and release of convicted traffickers "" .
Daud described their release as a "" big psychological blow "" to him and the country 's counter - narcotics police force .
Masoon Stanekzai , a senior government official charged with disarming militias and "" reintegrating "" Taliban insurgents , is reported to have feared for his own life after defying Karzai 's many demands to remove two provincial election candidates from Helmand from a blacklist so they could stand .
Both were known drug traffickers and members of illegal militias .
Stanekzai told the embassy that he received threats and menacing visits to his office from the men , who on one occasion brought along a 54-man militia that Stanekzai was supposed to have disbanded .
The highly respected minister said the president himself was involved in the threats .
The cable says : "" Karzai himself has made no overt threats but he [ Stanekzai ] believes the president is behind a litany of visits Stanekzai has had by known warlords – including the two narcotics traffickers – accompanied by their private militias in the past two weeks .
"" The incident was "" an example of Karzai meddling in the elections by using intimidation to protect known thugs "" ."

EO 12958 DECL :
02/16/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREL , PTER , SNAR , AF , PK , IR SUBJECT :
PRESIDENT KARZAI PREVIEWS STRATEGIC REVIEW IDEAS FOR USD / P
FLOURNOY 1 .
( C NF )
President Karzai on February 15 told Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Flournoy that his government welcomed the opportunity to join in the USG 's strategic policy review .
He suggested his team likely would advocate for : 1 ) greater efforts to target terrorist leaders and sanctuaries in Pakistan ; 2 ) additional work to strengthen Afghan communities to enhance security ; and 3 ) new multilateral talks with individual groups of Taliban who agree to respect the Afghan constitution .
On the contentious issue of civilian casualties , Karzai expressed satisfaction with the recent agreement on specific military operations and a willingness to move forward .
The President predicted Iran would respond positively to the new US administration 's offers of dialog .
-----------------
FOCUS ON PAKISTAN
----------------- 2 .
( C NF )
The fight for stability in Afghanistan must be taken to the terrorist planners and their sanctuaries in Pakistan , Karzai said .
He noted he had long argued for greater efforts in this direction , including in public remarks in Kabul in 2005 .
Karzai expressed frustration that the close relationship between the United States and Pakistan had yet to yield a serious campaign against terrorist leaders operating there .
Instead , he argued , Afghanistan paid the price of perceived US and Pakistani reluctance to grapple with the problem .
Pakistan , of course , had long used Islamic fundamentalism as a policy tool .
But "" Pakistan is a puzzle to me now , "" Karzai admitted .
"" I see things happening on a massive scale in the northwest that are not the work of ISI , "" the Pakistani intelligence service .
3 .
( C NF )
On cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan , Karzai said , "" Zardari is of a different ( positive ) mindset . ""
The Pakistani President has yet to move , however , from good intentions to implementation , and is weak .
Karzai asked Flournoy whether the US strategic review envisioned more direct bilateral military cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan , with the US or NATO as broker , or whether only greater US - Pakistan military cooperation was under consideration .
Flournoy replied that the regional strategic review , while urgent and extremely important to the new US administration , was only just underway .
-----------------------
RENEW COMMUNITY SUPPORT
-----------------------
3 .
( C NF )
The President underscored his analysis that the support of communities was key to countering the insurgency .
When I first returned to Afghanistan , Karzai mused , I had only 14 American soldiers with me .
But we had the Afghan people with us , they believed in the moral correctness of what we were doing , and even Helmand was safe for girls to go to school .
Now , 4000 ( sic ) British soldiers are in Helmand , and the people are not safe .
"" We must stand on a higher moral platform than the bad guys , "" the President said .
4 .
( C NF )
Community empowerment is not about the arming the tribes , Karzai noted .
Media speculation about this approach is misleading .
We need ordinary people , the elders and the villagers , to trust in the government 's ability to do the right thing , and give them what they need to be able to defend themselves , the President said .
In turn , the government must minimize civilian casualties , limit night raids , and make sure women and children are protected during military operations .
Increasing the numbers and capabilities of the police and army , and strengthening government institutions , are also important , Karzai added .
----------------------
TALK TO AFHGAN TALIBAN
---------------------- 5 .
( C NF ) Afghanistan and the US together should formally launch a process of peace - making with those Taliban who are not al Qaeda or part of any terrorist network , Karzai proposed .
There are groups and individuals who would accept the Afghan constitution , who have "" run away "" from us because of our own failings , he said .
Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , and religious leaders have the right resources to make such a process work and should participate .
But US partnership with Afghanistan is key to success and has been the missing element in efforts to date .
6 .
( C NF )
If there really was a Taliban movement , Karzai said , I would be greatly worried by US reports that Iran is supporting the Taliban .
But I do not think the Taliban is really a movement .
It is the result of three decades of past Pakistani policy , plus a lot of poor , desperate kids who lack KABUL 00000376
002 OF 002 connection to a family or community .
-------------------------
FRIENDS DESPITE FRICTIONS ------------------------- 7 .
( C NF )
On several topics , Karzai said , recent frictions in the bilateral relationship represent "" annoyances "" between "" friends . ""
"" We have been hurt by some recent statements , "" he said , and also I know my "" loud speeches "" on civilian casualties hurt your feelings .
Still , the two nations have common interests , and the two peoples are friends .
Afghanistan is very grateful for the generosity of US aid in reconstruction and development .
The agreement on civilian casualties is a "" good start "" and we can now move forward to implement it and so speak with one voice on this issue .
On Iran , Karzai said , Afghanistan can not be a channel , but we can help you convey the nuances of your demands .
Iran is likely to respond positively to US offers of dialog even though it will never give up its nuclear programs .
Progress in curbing poppy cultivation this year probably largely reflects market forces such as high wheat prices .
Afghans consider poppy "" not respectable , "" however , and with stability and hope for the future will respond to international efforts to replace its cultivation with alternate livelihoods .
8 .
( C ) Comment :
Coming in the immediate aftermath of Special Representative Holbrooke 's visit , this meeting reflected Karzai 's effort to stick by his agreement to re - found the relationship .
His calm , constructive comments on civilian casualties contrast sharply to his attitude previously .

Classified By : Charge Christopher Dell for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) 1 .
( C ) SUMMARY :
Assistant Secretary for
South and Central Asian Affairs Richard Boucher 's August 27 meetings with President Karzai , Foreign Minister Spanta , Lower House Speaker Qanooni and National Security Advisor Rassoul spanned a range of key topics .
Boucher , Karzai and Rassoul agreed to focus on themes of economic cooperation , intelligence- sharing , refugees , controlling illicit border traffic , and engaging the tribes during the upcoming trilateral meeting between Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte , Rassoul , and Pakistani National Security Advisor Aziz .
Karzai 's vision of a UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan largely mirrors U.S. thoughts on the issue .
Discussion of counternarcotics and governance led Karzai to make a pitch for the international community to give the Afghan government room to do governance "" the Afghan way . ""
Boucher pressed Spanta and Qanooni to ensure that Iran 's role in Afghanistan is limited to a constructive one .
End Summary .
------
JIRGAS ------
2 .
( C ) Karzai seemed pleased when Boucher shared that the recent Afghanistan - Pakistan jirga had been portrayed favorably in the U.S. media .
Karzai commented that six months would be an ideal time frame after which to host the next jirga in Pakistan .
Both agreed that the Afghan jirga was an important confidence - building measure , but Boucher expressed his hope that the next jirga in Pakistan might produce more concrete agreements .
He raised the upcoming visit of Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte as an opportunity to capitalize on the momentum of the jirga and ensure continued progress towards the next one .
Boucher raised the idea of having the Afghan and Pakistani National Security Advisors meet together with Negroponte during his visit to Jalalabad near the Afghan - Pakistani border and proposed that the three work together to identify specific issues where the greatest cooperation is needed ( such as economic cooperation , intelligence - sharing and controlling illicit border traffic ) .
Boucher also pushed for a discussion of how to engage the tribes along the border , whose buy - in is essential to the staying power of any future jirga agreements .
Karzai , Spanta and Rassoul were each on board with this .
3 .
( C ) Karzai shared that there was a recent gathering of Pakistani tribal chiefs in Peshawar during which the chiefs expressed a desire for the same rights and freedoms as ordinary Pakistani citizens .
However , Karzai noted that these same tribes had recently refused to celebrate Pakistani Independence Day .
Karzai said the Pakistani government needed to pull tribal leaders into a system of formal representation , while Boucher noted that Pakistani Interior Minister Sherpao did not think a political party system within the Tribal Areas would be feasible in the near term .
4 .
( C )
In a separate discussion with Boucher , National Security Advisor Rassoul said Karzai had initiated the process of finalizing the list of participants in the commission that will implement the agreements from the first jirga .
Boucher seconded Sherpao 's desire to see a commission comprised of those "" who can get things done . ""
In an encouraging sign , Rassoul acknowledged that Sherpao had been a very helpful partner in the lead - up to , execution of and follow - up to the first jirga .
Rassoul stated that the first task would be to work on the continuation of dialogue with the "" opposition , "" including Taliban .
Boucher pushed specifically for the jirga commission to identify who the opposition is and relayed Sherpao 's interest in bringing those "" who are not part KABUL 00002998 002 OF 006 of the Taliban but sympathetic to them into the jirga process . ""
Both agreed that Afghanistan 's official reconciliation process ( commonly referred to as "" PTS "" ) is not appropriate for high - level leaders and large groups , so the jirga commission could play a role in defining a more appropriate process for people in this category .
5 .
( C )
Boucher shared his opinion that Pakistan is "" making a real effort now by going after the hardest targets , including Pakistani and Arab insurgents , "" which has already yielded results .
Rassoul noted that his government is considering using the Provincial Communications Center model ( currently used to coordinate information among the Afghan National Security Forces at the provincial level ) to set up a nexus for intelligence - sharing between the Afghan and Pakistani governments .
Pakistan is concerned about Baluch rebels who are operating in and supported from Afghanistan , and Boucher stressed the importance of the Afghan government doing all it can to crack down on this .
6 .
( C )
During the meeting with Spanta , the Foreign Minister indicated that while he had been skeptical about the jirga himself , he had considered it a major success in the end .
He said that the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs was sending five newly appointed diplomats to Pakistan for training -- a significant goodwill gesture following the jirga , as Afghanistan has refused educational assistance from Pakistan in the past .
Spanta said Musharraf 's appearance at the end of the jirga was a real high point .
Boucher emphasized that it was Karzai 's urging that changed Musharraf 's mind .
Boucher clarified that Musharraf 's initial decision not to attend was not a snub to the jirga itself but a cautionary move by Musharraf , who feared the Pakistani Supreme Court would rule to allow former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan .
Spanta conceded that , "" We know Sharif is bad news .
He is the author of Islamic radicalism in our region . ""
Boucher agreed that Sharif could return to lead a movement that is pro - Islam , anti - Musharraf and anti-
U.S. ----------------
UN SPECIAL ENVOY
---------------- 7 .
( C )
When Boucher asked Karzai his thoughts on the best role for a UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan , Karzai stated , "" If it would be a UN Envoy that would bring better coordination among the international community at capitals and also cause better coordination in Afghanistan , and within the Alliance on Afghanistan , then good .
But if it is someone who would set up a parallel government of internationals , then no . ""
At one point Karzai stated , "" I do not want a stronger UN , "" then clarified that "" I want the UN to be a stronger coordinator of the international community , yes , but not a parallel government in Afghanistan . ""
( Note : The British have indicated their vision of a Special Envoy who would be based in and work primarily in Afghanistan , whereas the U.S. and Afghan sides envision an envoy who would spend a great deal of time fund - raising and coordinating donor strategies in donor country capitals .
End note . )
8 .
( C )
During his meeting with Rassoul , Boucher commented that the French government had been considering running a Provincial Reconstruction Team and that the French Ministers of Defense and Foreign Affairs plan to visit Afghanistan soon .
Boucher , Rassoul , and the Ambassador discussed future prospects for other donor country involvement in Afghanistan , noting that the Canadians were "" iffy "" and that the Dutch may leave after 2009 .
The British , French , Australians and U.S. will likely stay KABUL 00002998 003 OF 006 for longer periods .
Rassoul asserted the importance of "" Afghanizing "" the war in Kandahar both in order to reduce Canadian casualties , which might encourage the Canadians to stay longer , and to prepare the Afghan National Army and police for Canada 's likely withdrawal .
Boucher noted that after a withdrawal of maneuver troops , the Canadians may still be willing to run a Provincial Reconstruction Team focused on development , as well as the training and equipping of Afghan National Security Forces .
Boucher noted that as 2009 is an election year , it would be good to encourage donor countries to stay throughout 2009- 2010 .
He also expressed hope that efforts to engage Pakistan now would increase security significantly in the next year or two , perhaps encouraging other countries to stay present in Afghanistan .
------------------------------------
LOOKING AHEAD ON ERADICATION EFFORTS
------------------------------------
9 .
( C )
Boucher noted that the UN Office of Drugs and Crime had released its latest assessment of drug production in Afghanistan .
He highlighted the report 's findings that while the number of poppy - free provinces had increased from six to thirteen , overall production in Afghanistan had increased by 34 per cent , particularly in Helmand .
Karzai reiterated his position against an aerial eradication campaign .
When Boucher asked Karzai for his thinking on ground - based spray , Karzai replied , "" We have not said no , but we 're not saying yes either .
We would have to inform the population and do it in a way that does not create enmity . ""
The Ambassador noted the difficulties in relying on manual eradication and pointed out that 16 of the 135 eradicators had been killed last year .
Boucher assured Karzai that the aerial spray decision was one for another year . ""
Another few years , "" Karzai interjected .
Boucher planted the idea of eventually doing aerial spray in Taliban controlled areas and manual eradication in those parts still loyal to the central government .
Karzai gave no immediate reaction .

The discussion on increased drug cultivation in Helmand sparked Karzai 's thoughts on establishing and maintaining central government authority in the provinces .
According to Karzai , "" The question is why do we have Taliban controlling these areas now when two years ago I had control of Helmand ?
When Sher Mohammad was governor there , we had girls in schools and only 160 foreign troops .
The international community pushed me to remove him and now look where we are . ""
Referring to Sher Mohammad , Karzai retorted , "" My question for you is , do you want a bad guy on your side or working for the Taliban ?
Where Afghans are in charge , drugs are less but where the international community is in charge , drugs are up .
""
The Ambassador countered that the scenario is more accurately read as the international community has invested its resources and manpower in the tougher provinces where , not coincidentally , the Taliban have stepped up their counterinsurgency and drug cultivation efforts to discredit both the Afghan government and international community .
Karzai conceded but added that the Afghan people do not see it that way from the ground .

Pressing the issue more firmly , Boucher asked Karzai whether it is possible to have the Afghan government in control using good guys , rather than the likes of Sher Mohammad as its agents . ""
Yes , but that is a gradual process , "" said Karzai .
Maintaining that KABUL 00002998

"" the most important thing is bringing the tribes to our side , "" he explained that the problem with the international community 's approach to date is that "" You are trying to pick and choose tribal chiefs ( who will expand the presence of the central government into rural areas ) , but that is not how the tribal system works .
A tribal chiefdom is jealously guarded .
It can not be taken by force and it can not be imposed from the outside .
When we distort tribal structures , the vacuum is filled by the Taliban , and that is exactly what has happened in Helmand and Uruzgan . ""
He noted that Kandahar is an exception because of his outreach to all the tribal chiefs there .
According to Karzai , "" the people in Helmand and Uruzgan are uneducated , so you have to fight the Taliban with local ingredients , "" unlike in more developed Kandahar .
He added , "" We can not bring tribal chiefs on board with governors because we say to them that we want you to support the governor , but we single out particular chiefs and say we do n't want them involved in the process .
Whether we like it or not , we have to work with these people . ""
Karzai and Rassoul both indicated that Karzai is currently focused on an outreach campaign to win backing from tribal leaders in Helmand .

Boucher informed Karzai that he would meet with Lower House Speaker Qanooni later that day .
Boucher told Karzai that his message to Qanooni would be : "" Political opposition is okay , but it has to be constructive . ""
Karzai 's advice was to remind Qanooni that he would not hold his position without U.S. backing .
As the conversation turned to political parties , Karzai commented , "" I will not be a political party man , but I will support parties , "" presumably referring to his rumored alliance with the newly formed Republican Party .
13 .
( C )
During the meeting with Qanooni , Boucher emphasized that Iran and Russia should not be given inroads for influence in a way that would disrupt the system .
Boucher clarified that while Iran 's investment in cultural and educational institutions was acceptable , its role in smuggling weapons into Afghanistan was not .
Qanooni responded by assuring Boucher and the Ambassador that Afghanistan continues to see the U.S. as its "" long - term partner . ""
Stressing that "" We are not asking Afghans to choose sides , "" Boucher expressed U.S. understanding for Afghanistan 's need to cultivate cooperative economic , business , cultural , and "" normal "" political relationships with Iran but reiterated that the line should be drawn at any activities that are disruptive to the establishment of a strong central government in Afghanistan .
Qanooni indicated that , aside from Iran and Russia , people allied with the Hizb - i - Islami Gulbuddin party continue to seek more positions of influence within the Afghan government administration .

( C ) Pointing out that , "" The security problems in southern Afghanistan are spreading to the north , "" Qanooni added that , "" While others think the security situation will remain in control , I and other members of Parliament have some concerns . ""
He pointed to recent Taliban activity in Kapisa , Nuristan , and Baghlan as evidence of this . ""
Only Panjshir is protected , "" he stated .
When Boucher asked how Taliban are able to operate in the north , where Pashtuns are a minority , Qanooni insisted that the Taliban have located and begun to infiltrate the predominantly Pashtun districts which are scattered around the north .
15 .
( C ) Qanooni mentioned the formation of a special committee from the Lower House that will be KABUL 00002998

( Note : He was referring primarily to the decision of Parliament to impeach Foreign Minister Spanta and Minister of Refugees Akbar .
Karzai mentioned that the Palace has also established a committee of six ministers to settle the issue with Parliament .

The topic of Iran also surfaced during Boucher 's meeting with Spanta , who acknowledged , "" We agree with the U.S. and U.K. that Iran is engaged in a lot of interference , but our interest in dealing with Iran is to be careful not to open a second front along the Iranian border with Afghanistan . ""
Spanta noted the Afghan government 's recent decision to reject a Memorandum of Understanding on military cooperation proposed by Iran .
Spanta also shared that Karzai had raised the issue of Iran 's involvement in smuggling weapons into Afghanistan with Iranian President Ahmedinejad , who Spanta said , "" denied it , of course , but the point was made . ""
Spanta noted that Iran was primarily invested in supporting political parties , mobilizing Shia mullahs , influencing the Afghan media , and providing material support to the Taliban .
He added that Iran is funding the completion of a railway that will go from Iran into Afghanistan and end outside Herat City .
Spanta expressed his uncertainty about the complicity of the Iranian Foreign Minister in providing material support to the Taliban , stating that "" He promised me he is not involved , but said that he is involved in supporting political parties in Afghanistan . ""
17 .

Spanta commented that his biggest problem is that Iran continues to send back Afghan refugees - both those who are registered and those who are not - and added that Iran does not coordinate with the Afghan government on the forced returns .

REGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION -----------------------------
18 .
( C )
Spanta explained that Afghanistan continues to work with Pakistan on transit trade and updating their formal treaty from the 1960 's .
They would also like to address this in the framework of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation .
Afghan Commerce Minister Farhang will travel to Pakistan shortly in hopes of making some progress .
Spanta moved next to a request for U.S. financial assistance for the upcoming conference of the Economic Cooperation Organization ( ECO ) , October 16 - 20 , 2007 in Herat , which is focused on regional economic cooperation between Afghanistan , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkey , Turkmenistan , Iran , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , and Pakistan .
Boucher promised to pass on the request but cautioned Spanta that the prospects were not good given how soon the conference would take place and the lack of U.S. membership in the organization .
19 .

Boucher stressed to Karzai and Spanta the need to follow - up on the success of the Tajik- Afghanistan bridge opening with a trucking and transit agreement that allows Afghan and Tajik vendors and distributors to transport their goods across the border .
The Ambassador pitched the idea of a truck leasing consortium project that would allow small- scale distributors , who could not afford to own trucks , to rent them when transporting their products .
Both Karzai and Spanta welcomed the idea .
Spanta noted that Afghan Commerce Minister Farhang will soon travel to Pakistan to discuss similar issues .
20 .

Spanta also noted that the Chinese are increasingly interested in becoming a regional economic partner as well as knowing more about what the larger international community is doing to invest in Afghanistan .

The October 3 meeting of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board will also focus on regional economic cooperation .
This will be an important follow - up to the success of the Tajik- Afghanistan bridge opening and an opportunity to capitalize on the momentum of the jirga , with economic cooperation presenting a clear win - win for all parties involved .

10/17/2018 TAGS PTER , PREL , AF SUBJECT : QAYUM KARZAI AND AMBASSADOR DISCUSS SAUDI RECONCILIATION TALKS REF : A. KABUL 2746 B. RIYADH 1510
Classified By :
Ambassador William B. Wood for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) 1 .
( C ) SUMMARY .
On October 13 , Abdul Qayum Karzai described to the Ambassador the potential Saudi reconciliation process .
He and Abdullah Anas developed the current initiative a year ago and secured Taliban engagement through Anas ' connection to Mullah Abdul Salam Zaif ( former Taliban Ambassador to Pakistan ) .
He led a recent Afghan delegation of 17 , including former Taliban officials , to Saudi Arabia for an informal meeting of mullahs and an iftar dinner with the King .
Qayum expressed concern about the fragility of the process and its vulnerability to being "" usurped "" by the government .
Saudi Arabia agreed to continue facilitating talks , but was firm it would not serve as an intermediary for the Taliban - they must work directly with Afghanistan .
Qayum said the King is concerned about being too closely linked to the Taliban and that media speculation regarding the recent Saudi - hosted event made some officials there nervous .
Qayum assured the Ambassador the U.S. would be consulted at every step and asked that the U.S. urge the Saudis to remain engaged .
( Qayum is President Karzai 's brother and an American citizen . )
2 .
( C )
For the past two and a half years , Qayum said he had been seeking a "" bottom - up "" process for engagement with reconciliable Taliban outside a governmental framework .
Although many senior Taliban were interested in ending hostilities , individual reconciliation was not an option for them politically .
In October 2007 , Qayum met with Abdullah Anas ( former Algerian mujahideen commander now living in London ) to discuss Anas ' proposal of engaging Muslim clerics and scholars to create a framework for talks with the Taliban .
Qayum suggested Saudi Arabia or Dubai .
Anas agreed and began to consul prominent Muslim scholars , rallying them around their shared concern that Taliban violence gave Islam "" a bad name "" throughout the world .
SEEKING SAUDI INVOLVEMENT 3 .
( C )
Anas and Qayum met with Dr. Mansour , advisor to King Abdullah , to ask Saudi Arabia to host the first engagement in this process : gathering a "" group of mullahs . ""
Mansour reacted positively to Saudi Arabia serving this role , in part because as it would dilute Saudi Arabia 's identification with Pakistan - and extremism .
According to Qayum , Mansour stated "" the international community sees us as a front . ""
Qayum noted that the Saudis see a directly link between Afghanistan 's security and their own stability concerns .
TALIBAN MULLAH ZAIF AGREES
TO PARTICIPATE 4 .
( C )
In April 2008 , Qayum hosted Dr. Mansour , Anas and Mullah Abdul Salam Zaif , former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan and informal line to Mullah Omar , at his home in Kandahar .
Qayum said that when his guests arrived the television was showing footage of a Taliban bombing attack on a mosque earlier that day .
The men were visibly upset by the carnage , including Zaif .
The shared reaction to the bombing set the tone for constructive talks and Zaif agreed to participate .
Qayum shared his view that Zaif is trying to carve a political space within the Taliban for reconciliation .
QAYUM PREPARES THE GROUND AND THE SAUDIS ENGAGE - CAUTIOUSLY 5 .
( C )
As a result of Qayum 's , and then President Karzai 's , meetings with Dr. Mansour , King Abdullah called Karzai directly to discuss the proposed process .
( The King 's role energized Karzai 's interest in the process for the first time . )
Over the next few months Qayum hosted a number of Taliban representatives in Kandahar to continue preparations .
6 .
( C )
Through the spring and summer representatives from both Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan shuttled back and forth .
Qayum and former Kandahar Governor Asadullah Khalid worked KABUL 00002782
002 OF 003 closely together , traveling to Saudi to meet with Mansour and Prince Miqrin , head of Saudi intelligence .
Mansour made more visits to Kabul and Anas continued to serve as go - between with Zaif and Taliban .
In August , Saudi Arabia agreed to host an initial contact meeting during Ramadan -- stressing the importance of maintaining a low profile .
While indicating the King Abdullah 's desire to assist , Miqrin made it clear the King was approaching the process cautiously and did not want to be linked too closely to the Taliban .
Miqrin said Saudi Arabia did n't want "" to be alone in this , "" highlighting the importance of keeping the U.S. and U.K. informed .
Miqrin also stressed the Taliban leadership should not see Saudi Arabia 's willingness to support the talks as an indication the country would serve as an intermediary ; the Taliban must pursue the reconciliation process directly with Afghanistan .
THE SEPTEMBER MEETING 7 .
( C )
In organizing the trip , Qayum , Mansour and Zaif agreed the focus would be on religious activities and peaceful exchanges , in keeping with the Ramadan season .
Both sides agreed a large group would not be advisable so there were 17 in the Afghan delegation , and only a subset would attend all meetings .
In addition to Zaif , Maulavi Ahmad Mutawakkil ( Taliban ex - Foreign Minister ) , Maulvi Abdul Hadi Shinwari ( former chief justice ) and current Afghan senator Arsala Rahmani agreed to attend .
Qayum denied reports that Hekmatyar sent a representative ; he said Hekmatyar 's nephew was in Saudi Arabia at the same time , but did not participate in the talks .
8 .
( C ) Qayum said the Saudis orchestrated the encounter carefully .
When the Taliban group arrived , Qayum went to his room while Mansour remained with the group to welcome them .
Mansour , like Miqrin , made opening points to the Taliban : Saudi Arabia condemned the killing of innocents in Afghanistan and viewed the Afghan constitution with the same respect as its own ; both share a common basis in the Koran .
The Saudis further clarified they would not support any Taliban proposals that infringed on the authority of the central Afghan government - such as the establishment of autonomous regions .
9 .
( C ) Qayum said Prince Miqrin called him just before dawn to brief him on the dinner and meeting .
Miqrin said a large group had come from Medina to meet the Afghan delegation and there had been an enthusiastic response from the Quetta participants .
Qayum said everyone reacted nervously when details of the process first leaked to the media - especially the Taliban participants and the Saudis .
Miqrin suggested an alternative location might be needed for talks - perhaps Dubai .
QAYUM DETERMINED
TO KEEP PROCESS DISCIPLINED AND
OUT OF GOVT HANDS 10 .
( C )
The Ambassador praised Qayum 's leadership on this important issue .
He stressed that such talks require discipline and patience .
Afghanistan must deal from a position of strength .
Qayum agreed , saying that if the military pressure on the Taliban eased the process would fail .
He confided what he had told Dr. Mansour - that the engagement must be kept simple and focused at the beginning - with the same facilitators guiding it until it matured .
It would collapse if too many people - or governments - became involved .
Qayum repeatedly expressed concern that the government might "" usurp "" the process : "" An Afghan government - based negotiation would lead to everyone at the table demanding a slice ( of the government ) , but the government would be unable to satisfy all of these competing demands and would take the blame for the negotiations ' failure .
"" 11 .
( C )
The Ambassador asked that the U.S. be advised if Afghanistan engaged any Taliban with ties to Al Qaeda and/or global terrorism in the reconciliation process - figures like Mullah Omar and Mullah Barader .
The U.S. did not oppose this KABUL 00002782
003 OF 003 process , stressed the Ambassador , but would not be a participant either .
Qayum accepted this and commented that he saw no way for Mullah Omar to survive the process - he did n't have the intelligence or popular support to emerge on top .
He and Barader were hated by too many elements within the Pashtun spectrum .
Perhaps exile was an option for them .
In closing , Qayum assured the Ambassador that the U.S. would be kept informed of all developments .
COMMENT 12 .
( C ) Qayum has President Karzai 's confidence , but is a neophyte in such a process .
The encounter in Saudi Arabia was with Afghan and Taliban proxies , rather than decision - makers .
It is especially unclear what connection Zaif and the other so - called Taliban representatives have with the Taliban leadership , although there are reports that Zaif met with two representatives from the Quetta Shura who had shadowed the delegation to follow developments and report back .
President Karzai is interested in this process at least as much because it represents a step forward in support from King Abdullah as because it holds some prospect for neutralizing some or all of the Taliban .
That said , this encounter could bring Saudi Arabia closer to Afghanistan and could have some benefits with the Taliban , especially if other pressures on the Taliban continue to grow .
We intend to be supportive , but without unrealistic expectations , and certainly with no direct U.S. involvement .
WOOD"
2010-12-02,"Britain 's four - year military stewardship of the troubled Helmand province has been scorned by President Hamid Karzai , top Afghan officials and the US commander of Nato troops , according to secret US diplomatic cables .
The dispatches expose a devastating contempt for the British failure to impose security and connect with ordinary Afghans .
The leaked US embassy cables covering Afghanistan also reveal : • Widespread suspicion of high - level corruption in the Afghan government , with one cable detailing how the vice - president was carrying $ 52 m in his suitcase when he was stopped at Dubai airport .
•
Iran 's growing influence in Afghanistan as Tehran finances senior politicians and , the cables allege , trains Taliban militants .
•
Anger among America 's allies when they discovered that the US military was charging a 15 % handling fee on hundreds of millions of dollars being raised internationally to build up the Afghan army .
The criticism of the British operation in Helmand centres on its failure to establish security in Sangin – the town which has become totemic as the place that has claimed more British lives than any other in Afghanistan .
The Helmand governor , Gulab Mangal , told a US team led by the vice - president , Joe Biden , in January 2009 that American forces were urgently needed as British security in Sangin was inadequate and did not even extend to the town 's main bazaar , according to a cable sent from the US embassy in Kabul .
"" I do not have anything against them [ the British ] but they must leave their bases and engage with the people , "" Mangal said .
In another cable in January 2009 the governor , who has received strong backing from the UK and the US , is reported to have delivered a scathing dressing down to British officials on the state of security in Sangin . ""
Stop calling it the Sangin district and start calling it the Sangin base – all you have done here is built a military camp next to the city , "" he said .
British troops , the same cable reported , told US officials that immediately outside the town "" cowboy country begins "" .
The problem was not a lack of troops , according to Mangal .
Even if they brought in thousands more , "" they would need a new plan and shift of focus to connect with people "" , he told Biden .
At the time the British effort was paralysed as it awaited a surge of US troops and the vast discretionary Cerp ( commander 's emergency response programme ) funds enjoyed by US commanders , the cable said .
"" The UK effort in Helmand is already in a ' wait and see ' mode , wildly speculating when and where US troops will go , obsessed about Cerp amounts , and doing nothing to correct the difficult situation already in Sangin , "" the embassy reported .
Karzai repeatedly muses to his US interlocutors on why the arrival of British troops coincided with a rapid deterioration in security in Helmand in 2006 .
In the aftermath of the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 Karzai recalled that he entered the south of the country with just 14 US special forces and that soon afterwards "" even Helmand was safe for girls to go school .
Now , 4,000 [ sic ] British soldiers are in Helmand and the people are not safe "" .
On several occasions Karzai is reported to have disparaged the UK military and blamed its approach – which rejected his preferred "" tribal solution "" of appointing an alleged drug trafficker as provincial governor – for the absence of security in Helmand .
At a meeting with Senator John McCain in December 2008 he said he was relieved that US marines were being sent to reinforce the British - led mission in Helmand and "" related an anecdote in which a woman from Helmand asked him to ' take the British away and give us back the Americans ' "" .
In another meeting with US officials , Rangin Dadfar Spanta , then foreign minister , expressed disappointment at the ordering of an extra 2,000 British soldiers to Helmand , arguing "" they were not ready to fight as actively as American soldiers "" .
The UK military effort in Helmand , which has grown to 10,000 troops and a cost of more than £ 5bn a year , is criticised by top US officials , who fear the British have bitten off more than they can chew with Afghanistan 's largest and most troublesome province .
In late 2008 , with concerns turning to security for the following year 's presidential election , the embassy said that without US support "" we and Karzai agree the British are not up to the task of securing Helmand "" .
Mangal appeared to agree , saying that US marines were providing the "" right model "" in Garmsir , another Helmand town .
They had remained in place for long enough to allow the bazaar , schools and clinics to reopen .
A successful handover had then been planned to ensure the new security zone could be maintained by the UK and Afghan security forces . ""
Unfortunately , the UK has not built on the US achievement by expanding the security zone around Garmsir still further , "" the cable said .
The British operation also attracted criticism from Dan McNeill , the commander of Nato forces in 2007 - 08 , for its failure to deal decisively with the drug trade in Helmand .
In mid-2007 McNeill was said to be "" particularly dismayed by the British effort .
They had made a mess of things in Helmand , their tactics were wrong , and the deal that London cut on Musa Qala had failed , "" he is reported as saying of a ceasefire agreement with the Taliban that allowed the British to pull besieged troops out of the town of Musa Qala in 2006 .
"" That agreement opened the door to narco - traffickers in that area , and now it was impossible to tell the difference between the traffickers and the insurgents .
The British could do a lot more , he said , and should , because they have the biggest stake , "" he said .
Britain 's presence has steadily increased since it first deployed units in Helmand in 2006 .
But a senior Whitehall official , Philip Barton , told the US embassy that "" the cupboard was bare "" and Britain could not deploy any more troops to Afghanistan .
The US embassy commented : "" HMG wants to be completely in synch with the US when the president announces the rollout of our strategy in Afghanistan .
[ Gordon ]
Brown 's government is eager to avoid the inevitable loss of political capital that would result if the media and Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition pounce on an apparent disconnect between US and UK views on the way forward in Afghanistan .
"" Another factor driving British thinking is increased irritation at some allies who , in the UK 's view , are not pulling their weight in Afghanistan .
Interlocutors most frequently cite Germany and France in this regard "" ."
2010-12-02,"Iran is financing a range of Afghan religious and political leaders , grooming Afghan religious scholars , training Taliban militants and even seeking to influence MPs , according to cables from the US embassy in Kabul .
The dispatches , relating conversations between American and Afghan officials , build up a picture of mounting Iranian involvement in its eastern neighbours .
In perhaps the most revealing , a top Hamid Karzai aide recently revealed to have received sacks of cash from the Iranian government told a senior US diplomat that all sorts of Afghan officials were on Tehran 's payroll , including some people nominated for cabinet positions .
Omar Daudzai "" also asserted that in addition to financing Afghan religious leaders , Iran had provided salary support for some [ Afghan government ] deputy ministers and other officials , including ' one or two even in the [ presidential ] palace ' , "" he told the then deputy US ambassador , Francis Ricciardone , in February . ""
Daudzai claimed that some of these officials had been relieved of their duties because ' you ca n't be an honest Afghan if you receive a package [ from Iran ] . '
"" The incident is striking because Daudzai attracted headlines in October when Karzai admitted his chief of staff had received "" bags of cash "" , containing hundreds of thousands of euros , from an Iranian official during an official trip with the president to Tehran .
The money was to support Karzai 's office , something the diplomatic cables reveal the Americans were told about in 2009 .
Daudzai told Ricciardone his government preferred the US 's sustained cash support to the occasional and unpredictable payments from Iran .
He said Afghans were trained to fight with the Taliban inside Iran and thousands of Afghan religious scholars were on the Iranian payroll , with the entire project co - ordinated by an official in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 's office .
His discussion with US diplomats , and many other cables concerning Iran , illustrate Kabul 's awkward relationship with a neighbouring country that provides financial aid but also bribes Afghan MPs and supplies weapons to insurgents .
In late 2007 the US under - secretary of defence for policy , Eric Edelman , told Karzai that "" Iranian meddling is getting increasingly lethal "" .
The warning came amid reports of the Taliban being provided with training camps inside Iran , explosively formed projectile weapons , and shoulder - held surface - to - air missiles capable of shooting down Nato planes .
The cable said Karzai believed Iran was trying to sabotage Afghanistan 's development to prevent it from becoming an important regional transit hub , and to protect its natural gas exports to India and Pakistan from central Asian competition .
Another 2009 report warned of Iranian officials in the Afghan parliament who "" routinely encourage parliament to support anti - coalition policies and to raise anti - American talking points during debates "" .
Mirwais Yasini , the deputy speaker of the lower house , is reported to have told a US official that an Iranian intelligence officer put pressure on him to change parliament 's agenda to allow for a debate about civilian casualties caused by Nato operations , and offered him "" support "" if he agreed .
When Yasini refused , two MPs raised the subject in a different debate , using identical talking points to the ones the Iranian spy had tried to push on him earlier .
Despite such provocation , the Afghan government has been reluctant to publicly criticise Iran 's behaviour , despite regular US pressure for them to speak out .
In an August 2007 meeting , the Afghan foreign minister , Rangin Dadfar Spanta , explained to Richard Boucher , then assistant secretary for south and central Asian affairs , that his government had to concentrate on the main threat – Pakistan 's support for insurgents – and could not afford to antagonise Iran .
"" We agree with the US and UK that Iran is engaged in a lot of interference , but our interest in dealing with Iran is to be careful not to open a second front along the Iranian border with Afghanistan . ""
However , Spanta , who told the Americans elsewhere that he believed "" Iran is at least as dangerous as Pakistan "" , claimed to have raised the issue with the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He "" denied it , of course , but the point was made "" .
He also took the matter up with the Iranian foreign minister who "" promised me he was not involved , but said that he is involved in supporting political parties in Afghanistan "" .
Daudzai also tackled Iranian officials about it , saying in February that the Iranians had stopped even denying the claims ; instead they "" just remain silent "" .
He told Riccciardone that claims that he personally was "" too pro - Iranian "" were slurs put out by his enemies .
He said that when he was appointed ambassador in Tehran the regime considered his appointment "" tantamount to establishing a US embassy "" and sent people to follow him everywhere he went ."
2010-12-03,"Foreign diplomats in Kabul fear that the publication of secret cables that portray the president of Afghanistan and his government in a deeply unflattering light will lead to a further slump in US - Afghan relations .
The US embassy , led by Karl Eikenberry , the ambassador who described Hamid Karzai in classified cables as "" a weak individual unfamiliar with the basics of nation - building "" has for the last week been engaged in pre - emptive damage limitation .
On Monday Eikenberry released a statement saying : "" The United States is absolutely committed to building and strengthening a long - term partnership with the Afghan people and the Afghan government .
Our shared goals do not change based on the release of purported diplomatic reporting from the past .
"" The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , also phoned the Afghan president to reassure him of US support .
But it remains to be seen whether the relationship will be weakened .
US diplomats in Kabul are furious with WikiLeaks , and believe it could do real damage to the vital relationship .
One official said the embassy had not yet got over the leaking earlier this year of a Eikenberry cable that argued a troop surge was unlikely to succeed because Karzai 's inept style of government meant the Afghan president was "" not an adequate strategic partner "" .
"" We never really recovered from the strategic partner cable , and we are worried this will make it worse , "" the official said .
With the government not working during the Afghan Friday weekend , there was no immediate official response , although a source close to Karzai 's office said they were still absorbing all the news .
Of even greater concern for the Americans is that the private but highly critical remarks about Karzai by some cabinet ministers could lead to some of the country 's few competent administrators losing their jobs .
They include Omar Zakhilwal , the highly regarded finance minister , who was quoted as saying that Karzai is "" an extremely weak man who did not listen to facts but was instead easily swayed by anyone who came to report even the most bizarre stories or plots against him "" .
One western diplomat said it was hard to know whether Zakhilwal would cling on : "" In a normal country it would be the honourable thing to tender his resignation , but it 's very hard to know . ""
The Canadian ambassador , William Crosbie , has reportedly offered to resign because of a published minute of a meeting with Eikenberry that said they must be "" prepared for a confrontation with Karzai "" to prevent the sort of rampant fraud that wrecked the 2009 presidential elections being allowed to occur in this year 's parliamentary poll .
He said Canada would demand that the "" international community must stand up for the silent majority or be blamed for letting Karzai and his family establish across the country the system of patronage and control that exists in Kandahar "" .
In Pakistan political and military leaders continued to grapple with the fallout from a storm of damaging revelations .
This morning the prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , chaired a meeting of senior ministers and generals following reports of perilous rifts inside the country 's fragile power politics .
According to the dispatches , the army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , threatened to oust the president , Asif Zardari , last year , while Zardari was so fearful of his fate that he made plans for his possible assassination .
Clinton phoned Zardari yesterday in an attempt to put the embarrassment behind them .
Zardari 's spokesman , Farhatullah Babar , said the leaks were "" out of context "" and "" did not reflect the true nature of the official correspondence "" .
Meanwhile morning newspapers continued to lead with stories gleaned from the files , while several rightwing commentators claimed the document dump was part of a US conspiracy to smear Muslim countries .
In Kabul , there appeared to be widespread agreement on the streets with Eikenberry 's assessment of Karzai as a weak leader .
Abdul Wahid , a Kabul shopkeeper , said : "" I agree that he ca n't make decisions and he does n't have a good administration to help him .
The people around him do n't want this government to succeed .
Karzai himself is a good man but the people around him are a mafia . ""
Ahmad Behzad , a politician , said : "" Karzai is seriously weak and that has given the terrorists the opportunity to destabilise the country .
He is not governing in the best interests of the country .
Eikenberry is right . """

Iran is extending its influence in Afghanistan in the same way it did in Iraq .
It has been supporting insurgent groups as well as financially backing politicians ."
2010-12-03,"The Ministry of Defence defended the conduct of operations in Helmand yesterday after revelations that the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , and the US commander of Nato troops had accused British troops of failing .
The criticism centred on a failure of the British military to impose security and to connect with Afghan civilians during a four - year stewardship of Helmand , Afghanistan 's largest and most troubled provice .
They came to light in a series of secret dispatches from the leaked US diplomatic cables .
The town of Sangin has claimed more British lives than any other in Afghanistan .
But US general Dan McNeill , who led Nato forces in Afganistan in 2007 - 2008 , is recorded as "" particularly dismayed "" by the British effort which had "" made a mess of things "" in the province .
An MoD spokesman said : "" UK forces did an excellent job in Sangin , an area which has always been and continues to be uniquely challenging , delivering progress by increasing security and taking the fight to the insurgency .
That work is now being continued by the US marines as part of a hugely increased Isaf [ the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ] presence across the whole of Helmand province . ""
"" Both Afghan leaders ( including the governor of Sangin ) and the US marines have publicly recognised and paid tribute to the sacrifice and achievements of the UK forces in that area . ""
Publically , the US has hailed British operations .
During the transfer of Helmand to US command earlier this year , Major General Richard Mills called the performance of British troops in the province as "" nothing short of magnificent "" .
But the cables also show negative comments were made by the governor , Gulab Mangal , who told a US team led by vice - president Joe Biden in January 2009 that "" I do not have anything against them [ the British ] but they must leave their bases and engage with the people . ""
Former defence secretary Geoff Hoon responded yesterday that he had raised concerns about the level of manpower needed for deployment in Helmand . ""
[ I ] basically said that we could do this , but only once we had drawn down significant numbers in Iraq , "" he told the Times .
Hoon , who left the MoD in 2005 , added : "" I was more concerned not about the ability of the men on the ground to do the job ; I had no doubt they could do the job . ""
My concern was whether we had enough resources overall to both do the job in Iraq , the existing job in Afghanistan ( because we were already fairly heavily deployed there ) as well as a new one .
That was the bit I was bothered about . ""
The efforts made by British troops were also strongly defended by Anthony Philipson , whose son James was one of the first soldiers to die in Helmand .
"" We have done the best we could with some of the finest infantry in the world ; we have taken terrible casualties .
Yes , the place is still a hotbed of violence , but I think it always will be . """
2010-12-04,"A senior member of Afghanistan 's cabinet has warned that the release of leaked US diplomatic cables will damage the country 's relations with the US .
Finance minister Omar Zakhilwal said it would no longer be "" business as usual "" between the government and US ambassador Karl Eikenberry after the leaking of the dispatches that portray the president of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai , and his government in a deeply unflattering light .
Zakhilwal also denied a report in a US embassy cable dated 26 February 2010 that he called Karzai an "" extremely weak man who did not listen to facts but was instead easily swayed by anyone who came to report even the most bizarre stories or plots against him "" .
The report is "" absolutely , categorically wrong and false , "" the highly regarded minister said .
US diplomats in Kabul are furious with WikiLeaks , and believe the leaked dispatches could do real damage to the vital relationship .
Of even greater concern for the Americans is that the private but highly critical remarks about Karzai by some cabinet ministers , including Zakhilwal , could lead to some of the country 's few competent administrators losing their jobs .
One western diplomat said it was hard to know whether Zakhilwal would cling on : "" In a normal country it would be the honourable thing to tender his resignation , but it 's very hard to know . ""
The US embassy , led by Eikenberry , who described Karzai in classified cables as "" a weak individual unfamiliar with the basics of nation - building "" , has for the last week been engaged in pre - emptive damage limitation .
On Monday Eikenberry released a statement saying : "" The US is absolutely committed to building and strengthening a long - term partnership with the Afghan people and the Afghan government .
Our shared goals do not change based on the release of purported diplomatic reporting from the past .
"" The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , also phoned the Afghan president to reassure him of US support .
One official said yesterday the embassy had not yet got over the leaking earlier this year of a cable that argued a troop surge was unlikely to succeed because Karzai 's inept style of government meant the Afghan president was "" not an adequate strategic partner "" .
"" We never really recovered from the strategic partner cable , and we are worried this will make it worse , "" the official said .
Karzai 's spokesman , Waheed Omar , has said that the presidential office was reviewing the documents , but that he did not believe they would strain US - Afghan relations ."
2010-12-07,"David Cameron flew into Kabul today for talks with Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , and admitted that leaked diplomatic cables exposing Afghan and US criticisms of Britain 's strategy in Helmand had raised "" embarrassing questions "" for Nato forces fighting the Taliban .
The prime minister is meeting Karzai and General David Petraeus , head of the International Security Assistance Force , after spending last night at Camp Bastion in central Helmand .
They are due to discuss progress in Afghanistan – described by Cameron 's aides as a "" military stock - take "" – as well as plans for the transition to an Afghan - led security force .
Cameron is particularly keen to discuss the "" reconciliation process "" by which forces are now attempting to win round low - level insurgents through offers of better work or lifestyles to sit alongside the military campaign against hardcore Taliban militants .
He also announced that £ 33 m from the cross - government Afghanistan fund will be used to refurbish 48 police stations and checkpoints in Helmand .
Yesterday , Cameron visited British and Afghan troops in Helmand , where he declared his "" cautious optimism "" for the progress being made and revived prospects for withdrawing some troops next year .
But he acknowledged the controversy caused by the leak of confidential US diplomatic cables by the WikiLeaks website , was hanging in the air .
Karzai , top Afghan officials and the US commander of Nato troops all expressed concerns over the failure of British troops to wrest control of parts of Helmand and connect with local people .
Concerns were also expressed about profound and widespread corruption in Afghanistan .
All the cables were more than a year old .
Yesterday , Cameron told troops at Camp Bastion : "" Of course WikiLeaks has led to lots of embarrassing questions and all the rest of it
but I think in the end it does n't change any of the fundamentals between Britain and America
, it does n't change any of the fundamentals between Britain , America and Afghanistan . ""
He revealed that he had Sunday lunch with the US ambassador to London before flying to Afghanistan . ""
The British - American relationship is incredibly strong , "" Cameron said .
"" When you look at actually what was said it was relating to a previous period where we all know now there were n't enough troops in Helmand .
We came in 2006 with a few thousand troops there are now 30,000 troops in Helmand . ""
General Sir David Richards , the chief of defence staff , addressing a press conference with Cameron , added : "" At no stage were they criticising our forces abilities it was all about our inability to produce the force rations the PM has been talking about since .
"" Karzai was described in one cable from the US ambassador Karl Eikenberry as having an "" inability to grasp the most rudimentary principles of state - building "" and having a "" deep - seated insecurity "" as a leader .
Asked about Karzai , Cameron said : "" Of course there will be areas of frank exchanges of views , areas of disagreement
but I 've met President Karzai consistently over the past five years and got to know him .
You have to appreciate that of course there are times of frustrations , but you have to appreciate that we want someone who is going to speak up for Afghanistan and who wants to take control of Afghanistan and who wants an Afghanistan without foreign forces on the soil .
That 's in our interest as well as his interest . """
2010-12-07,"David Cameron and the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , today attempted to heal the diplomatic damage of the WikiLeaks revelations that top Afghan officials strongly criticised Britain 's role in Helmand province , claiming they did n't want to let this come between their "" strong "" relationship .
But both Cameron and Karzai , speaking from the presidential palace in Kabul after an hour - long meeting , acknowledged that some of the allegations contained in the leaked cables were true – in particular , the lack of personnel to adequately control the wartorn region .
Cameron said : "" I do n't want the WikiLeaks to come between our strong relationship .
Some of the WikiLeak[s ] references [ were to ] not [ having ] enough troops and that was true if you look back to 2006 ...
It was that we did n't have the forces on the ground . ""
But he insisted that the American troop surge this year had changed that and allowed a greater focus on the central Helmand region , giving rise to "" cautious optimism "" about progress to bring peace to Afghanistan .
Karzai said : "" The WikiLeaks documents are having some truths and some not so truths in them .
Britain has been a steadfast supporter of Afghanistan and the Afghan people .
Britain has contributed in its sacrifice of its soldiers ... for which the Afghan people are grateful .
My word to the British people from the Afghan people is gratitude . ""
Cameron and Karzai discussed the ongoing combat , transition towards the 2014 deadline to hand over complete control of security to the Afghan national army and what Britain 's role would be after the end of the combat phase in 2015 .
One No 10 official said : "" The president is asking the UK to play a greater role in training the Afghan national army , as we begin to draw down combat troops and play less of a direct role .
You could imagine Britain playing a role in officer training in Kabul , for instance . ""
Cameron sent a message to the Afghan people saying that even after the complete withdrawal of troops in 2015 , Britain would remain a "" close and reliable friend "" providing non - military support in the form of aid and diplomatic support .
Cameron 's two - day visit to Afghanistan has been quietly shaped by the fallout from the WikiLeaks revelations .
On Sunday before flying out he had lunch with the American ambassador to London .
He has also met the key players while in Afghanistan including the governor of Helmand , Gulab Mangal , and General David Petraeus , the American head of the international security force in the country .
Mangal was behind one of the most damaging leaked cables , in which he was said to have claimed that British troops were failing properly to police the notoriously dangerous Sangin district and did n't leave their base enough .
Cameron said of his meeting with Mangal : "" It 's very good to see my friend Governor Mangal again
and I 've been very struck on this visit by the progress being made here in Helmand . ""
Whether it is distribution of wheat seed and the decline in the poppy crop , whether it 's the increase in security , whether it 's the fact the government is more effective in collecting taxes , whether it 's the number of schools that are open , the number of children going to school , a number of things seem to be moving in the right direction in a very positive way
and I think a lot of that is the governor of Helmand and the very good work he 's been doing .
"" Making light of what has clearly been a tricky diplomatic period after the WikiLeaks revelations , Karzai said : "" You should wait for the British WikiLeaks . ""
Cameron responded : "" We were always nice about you , "" to which Karzai answered : "" Most of the time . ""
Questioned earlier by an Afghan journalist about Britain 's record in Helmand , Cameron said : "" Britain performed very well in Sangin .
We were stationed there between 2006 and 2010 and did very good work in Sangin
but since the arrival of US marines we 've been able to make sure our forces are better balanced and so Britain is concentrated in central Helmand and the US are covering other parts of Helmand and we now have a better balance of forces and it means development and progress can take place in all parts of Helmand . """
2010-12-07,"David Cameron landed in Camp Bastion yesterday to pay a seasonal visit to the troops accompanied by the ghosts of Christmas past .
Tony Blair , on his first Afghan visit , recalled being met by Hamid Karzai and a haphazard guard of honour in uniforms "" begged , borrowed , or stolen "" from the armies of the world .
Gordon Brown 's last trip in March was dogged by accusations that troops were ill - equipped for the task .
Cameron 's own first visit as prime minister in the summer was disrupted by a suspected assassination attempt .
Cameron had three messages to show he has learnt each of these lessons : that there is progress – slow , painful and rife with setbacks , but progress nonetheless – being made to improve security ; that the new Afghan National Army and police forces are being trained ahead of schedule ; and that the British troops are now better equipped .
He came bearing promises of new Warthog armoured tanks before Christmas , and a doubling of the capability of new generation "" Reaper "" drones .
Speaking from Camp Bastion , Cameron said : "" We are not aiming for a perfect Swiss - style democracy in the Hindu Kush .
We are aiming for an Afghanistan that has a basic level of stability and security , and a growing economy , so that people can share in its prosperity .
You are beginning to see some positive signs of that . ""
This Christmas , the 10th since the war began in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on New York and the fifth that British Forces have been deployed on the ground , is set to be the beginning of the end .
There are international promises that the Afghan National Army will begin to take responsibility from July next year .
Cameron said yesterday there was still the possibility of the beginnings of phased withdrawal next year – though No 10 insisted it was not a certainty – in a concerted effort to dampen expectations of imminent withdrawal .
The American - led review of the deployment of troops expected by the end of this year has now been "" downgraded "" , the description used by Downing Street , in favour of the longer - term targets for the end to the conflict .
But the view from Helmand suggests that the real battles to make the country safe and self - sufficient are still only just beginning .
David Eastman , the official spokesman for Taskforce Helmand , describes this year 's consolidation of British troops in central Helmand , backed up by the extra 20,000 US troops taking over the wider district , including the notorious Sangin base from which so many UK soldiers have died , as the breakthrough that is needed .
"" It 's all moving , but it 's moving at Afghan speed , "" he says .
"" We may be able to do it faster
but we do n't want it to collapse like a deck of cards behind us . ""
Cameron 's aides distributed dossiers documenting the progress that has been made : 75 % of the National Afghan Police now are now trained , the Afghan National Army is beginning to lead its own missions in the war , there are poetry readings and concerts in the stadiums where the Taliban used to stage executions , and 37 % of girls aged 12 - 16 can now read and write , compared with 10 % of those in their twenties .
But the same document acknowledged that violence has increased in some regions , and the BBC yesterday reported the results of a poll of 2,000 Afghans , which revealed that this year 27 % thought that attacks on international forces were justifiable – compared with just 8 % last year .
Yesterday , the flags were flying at half mast across Camp Bastion after the 101st death of a British soldier this year was confirmed , taking the total to 346 over the 10 years and close to the record set last year of 108 .
In the dusty grey plains of Camp Bastion , the four - mile by two - mile strip where the majority of 9,500 British forces are based , Foreign Office officials now say that the working relationship between the international and Afghan security forces is the key to successful transition .
Captain Faramoush is the second in command of the Afghan National Army brigade training centre at Bastion , where new recruits are sent from across the country to learn the art of spotting and disposing of road side devices .
Speaking via a translator , he says he is confident that by the 2015 deadline they will be able to "" stand on their own two feet "" .
But only with the right equipment , he adds .
"" If we have everything , equipment , aeroplanes , like your country has , we will take the security for ourselves , "" he says .
The other major problem , he says , is the turnover of recruits who join on three - year contracts and invariably leave .
It means that young soldiers with as little as six months ' training are doing the most dangerous work of disposing of explosives .
Once they gain sound experience , they move on .
But the leak of 250,000 diplomatic cables , including those documenting severe criticisms of the British role in Afghanistan , casts a shadow over that process of multilateral collaboration .
Cameron boarded his flight to Afghanistan straight from Sunday lunch with the American ambassador in London , and similarly the troops here in Bastion have to work alongside Americans and Afghans whose leaders criticised their work in the leaked cables .
One senior Foreign Office source working in the region said British troops were stung by the reports .
"" One soldier I spoke to was more angry at the Afghan comments than those from the Americans . ""
He said : ' Why are n't they grateful ? '
"" Around the camp , soldiers say are not keen to discuss their views of WikiLeaks .
But they recognise the term and its significance here .
Trooper Ben Granville , demonstrating one of the new Warthog armoured vehicles , which he says he has witnessed saving lives , is impatient and dismissive of the row .
"" To be honest , we do n't take notice of things like that .
We 've enough on our plate . """
2010-12-07,"8.18am : David Cameron is in Afghanistan this morning .
He has just been holding a press conference in Kabul .
My colleague Polly Curtis is travelling with him and this morning she 's already filed a fresh story about his talks with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
Back in London , the key event is going to come at 3.30pm , when Kenneth Clarke , the justice secretary , unveils his green paper on rehabilitation and sentencing .
My colleague Alan Travis has already outlined many of the measures that the document will contain and Clarke has just given an interview about his plans to the Today programme .
( I 'll summarise what he said shortly . )
But the Commons statement should still be pretty interesting , partly because we 'll find out how much opposition Clarke attracts from the Tory right
( Travis says in his story that the green paper was delayed because Downing Street had "" presentational concerns "" about Clarke 's plans ) and partly because we might learn more about where Labour stands on this issue .
At the moment it 's still not particularly clear whether Labour is going to try outflanking Clarke on the right .
Otherwise , it 's a patchy day .
At some point the Home Office is going to make a statement about student visas .
Alan Travis ( busy man ) says that up to 120,000 international students from outside the EU who come to Britain to take "" below - degree - level "" courses could be refused entry .
Iain Duncan Smith is giving a speech on welfare reform at 11.45am .
Nick Clegg is also meeting Lib Dem MPs to discuss tuition fees , but that will be taking place tonight , after I 've closed for business .
Until then , I 'll be covering all the breaking political news , as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web .
8.47am :
Michael Howard ( now Lord Howard ) was on the Today programme earlier this morning .
Rather to the disappointment of the producers , I assume , he said that he expected he would agree with everything that Kenneth Clarke would be proposing today .
I warmly welcome [ Clarke 's ] approach to rehabilitation and
I hope I 'm going to be able to agree with everything in the green paper .
But Howard did confirm that there was still one issue on which he and his former cabinet colleague did n't see eye to eye .
The one point where I do disagree with him is when he suggests that the remarkable fall in crime we have seen since 1993 has nothing to do with the rise in the prison population .
We have seen a very significant increase in the prison population since 1993 and an almost halving in the rate of crime .
These two things have gone together - they are connected .
9.19am :
And here are the main points from Kenneth Clarke 's interview with the Today programme .
Some of the quotes are from PoliticsHome .
•
He said that it was wrong to keep sending more people to prison .
He mocked the idea that there was anyone who thought that having 85,000 people in prison was n't enough .
He also said that even in "" the most rightwing states in the United States of America "" the authorities had given up just trying to increase the prison population .
There has been a huge increase in the number of people in prison .
It is not only not good value for money .
Even more importantly , I do n't think that is the right way to protect people .
•
He claimed that it was not possible to prove a link between the number of people in prison and the crime rate .
"" You ca n't prove it one way or the other , "" Clarke said .
"" You could have charts [ of some countries ] where you get falling crime and it matches a falling prison population . ""
•
He said the measures being announced today would cut the prison population by about 3,000 .
•
He said more rehabilitation was needed to stop a "" criminal underclass "" being nurtured in prisons .
"" We 've got to stop having this revolving door where people go into prison , serve their time , come out and within less than a year half of them have committed some more crime , "" he said .
He accused Labour of neglecting this issue .
The prison system at the moment is not doing one of the jobs it 's meant to do , that is stopping developing a criminal underclass who just keep committing more crime as soon as they come out .
That 's because we 're not tackling the problems of drugs , not tackling the problems of alcohol abuse , not tackling the problems of mental illness in prisons .
We 're not helping the ones that can go straight .
•
He said that he expected Michael Howard to agree with everything he was announcing today .
In jovial terms , he criticised the Today programme for trying to stir up a row between them .
9.39am :
Earlier I said it would be interesting to see what Labour has to say about Kenneth Clarke 's sentencing green paper .
Judging by a comment released last night , the party is going to attack it on the grounds that it 's a spending cut .
This is statement issued by Sadiq Khan , the shadow justice secretary .
A sentencing review that should have been about reducing reoffending and protecting the public seems to have become just an exercise in cutting costs .
Sadly , despite Cameron 's rhetoric about putting the public first , the government have retreated to a traditionally Tory ideological approach , setting an arbitrary target for the prison population , rather than addressing the primary concern of protecting the public .
This suggests that we 're in the curious position where a sentencing green paper that at face value appears rather liberal is getting more support from Michael Howard ( see 8.47am ) than from Labour .
I 'm sure the position will become clear in the Commons this afternoon .
10.10am :
In the Commons this afternoon the European Union bill is going to get its second reading .
This is the measure that says the government will have to hold a referendum if it plans to transfer any more power to the EU .
On the BBC News this morning , William Hague , the foreign secretary , claimed this was "" the most important piece of legislation on European matters since Britain joined the EEC as it was then in the early 1970s "" .
The bill also contains a "" sovereignty clause "" , which makes it clear that EU law does not undermine the sovereignty of parliament .
Today the European scrutiny committee has published a report explaining how this will work .
The committee , which is chaired by Bill Cash , the Tory MP , says : "" The evidence we received suggests that the legislative supremacy of parliament is not currently under threat from EU law . ""
10.11am :
Philip Davies , the Tory MP for Shipley , has been on Radio 5 Live to say that he has "" concerns "" about Kenneth Clarke 's plans to cut the number of people in jail .
"" There is no reason why rehabilitation ca n't take place in prison , "" he said .
According to PoliticsHome , he also said that David Cameron should not be making too many concessions to the Liberal Democrats .
We ca n't have the tail wagging the dog as far as the coalition is concerned .
The Conservatives make up five - sixths or four - fifths of the coalition and you know , the prime minister ought to remember that he is also in coalition with the Conservatives .
10.15am :
Ken Livingstone has named Val Shawcross as his running mate in the London mayoral contest in 2012 .
If Livingstone wins , Shawcross will be deputy mayor .
10.31am :
My colleague Matthew Weaver is writing a WikiLeaks live blog which is covering the news of the arrest of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .
10.45am :
For the record , here are the latest YouGov GB polling figures .
Conservatives : 42 % ( up 5 points since the general election )
Labour : 39 % ( up 9 )
Lib Dems : 10 % ( down 14 )
Government approval : -8
11.17am :
You can read all today 's Guardian politics stories here .
And all the politics stories filed yesterday , including some in today 's paper , are here .
As for the rest of the papers , here are some articles I found particularly interesting .
•
Tim Shipman and Stephen Wright in the Daily Mail say one in seven House of Commons passholders is a foreign national .
Incredibly , researchers are subjected to less stringent checks than cleaners and catering staff ...
A senior source said the Security Service MI5 is rarely asked to examine the suitability of would - be researchers and claimed the vetting system is a ' hopeless mess ' .
Yet up to 1,000 of the 6,500 passholders who work regularly on the Parliamentary estate are understood to be foreign nationals .
And Commons insiders complained that when more rigorous vetting does take place , MPs complain to House authorities , urging them to nod through the applications .
•
Rachel Sylvester in the Times ( paywall ) says that privately Kenneth Clarke is in favour of scrapping minimum sentences altogether .
There has been intense nervousness in Downing Street about a tabloid , and backbench , backlash if the Government is seen to be going soft on criminals .
Left to his own devices , Mr Clarke would have gone far further in creating alternatives to prison and reducing the jail population .
Privately he sees no reason not to scrap minimum sentences altogether , although he understands this would be politically impossible for the worst crimes including murder .
"" It 's time somebody stood up to the tabloids and the bang-'em - up brigade , "" a senior source at the Justice Department says .
•
Jonathan Aitken in the Times ( paywall ) says Clarke 's rehabilitation green paper will include measures to make community punishments tougher .
Six weeks ago Crispin Blunt , the Prisons Minister , made a series of unannounced visits to groups of young offenders serving community sentences on projects in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire .
At the first group , the incognito minister discovered that only four of the twelve offenders had bothered to turn up .
At the second , only five out of ten had .
Dismayed by the prevailing rate of no - shows , for which the only sanction was that the absent offenders postponed their hours of rehabilitation work , Mr Blunt resolved to give punitive teeth to the community payback scheme ...
So a package of carrot - and - stick reforms has been devised to deliver community sentences more robustly .
A young offender who fails to turn up will , without further recourse to the courts , have to pay a fine .
If the fine is not paid , assets such as his mobile phone or CD player will be seized by bailiffs .

Nick Clegg in the Financial Times ( subscription ) says the government 's university reforms will make Britain fairer .
The uncomfortable truth is that the growth in the university population in recent years has done little or nothing to boost social mobility .
The student population has become more middle - class dominated .
The coalition is intent on making universities more effective engines of social mobility .
The proposed new £ 150 m national scholarship fund will give additional financial help to the poorest applicants .
Tougher access requirements for those who want to charge up to the £ 9,000 cap will open the doors of the best universities to a wider mix .
For the first time since Labour introduced fees , part - time students will also be brought into the same funding system as full - time students .
This means they will no longer be singled out , unfairly , to pay up - front fees .
•
And Philip Stephens in the Financial Times ( subscription ) says the government should have cut winter fuel payments to find more money for universities .
This did not happen because of the structure of the coalition , he says .
The Treasury , the big spending departments such as health , work and pensions , education , local government and home affairs , and the Foreign Office , are all in the hands of Tory ministers .
The result is a dynamic in which policy formulation and initiative and the setting of priorities rest almost entirely with Mr Cameron 's party .
Mr Clegg 's role is essentially reactive .
Somehow , the deputy prime minister has to change the balance of power .
If not , the tuition fees fiasco may well turn out the first of many .
11.45am :
In his FT article ( see 11.17am )
Nick Clegg said the government 's university reform plans would include a £ 150 m for a national scholarship fund .
David Willetts , the universities minister , gave more details of how this will work at the weekend .
He said it would enable the poorest students to have their fees paid for up to two years .
A university thinktank , Million+ , has strongly condemned the plan .
It says the government scheme could actually end up penalising those doing most to promote social mobility , because universities charging more than £ 6,000 a year in fees will have to fund a year 's tuition for poor students ( those who were eligible for free school meals when they were at school ) .
Pam Tatlow , the chief executive of Million+ , has explained her concerns in a letter to Willetts .
Here 's an extract .
Free school meal students are not evenly distributed between universities …
[ proposals ] that require universities to match - fund a year 's free tuition for students who have previously been in receipt of free school meals would have damaging consequences for universities which contribute most to social mobility and who admit more students from disadvantaged and free school meal backgrounds .
11.56am :
Michael Gove , the education secretary , has praised the Labour MP David Lammy for highlighting figures about the tiny number of black students admitted to Oxbridge .
Gove blamed Labour .
According to PoliticsHome , this is what he told BBC News .
David 's research is entirely welcome and it shows the government of which he was part -
and I 'm a great fan of his - absolutely failed to advance social mobility .
It 's a scandal .
The chances of a poor person going to Oxbridge under Labour were 2000 - 1 against .
The reason for that is that our schools system is not good enough .
12.18pm :
Damian Green , the immigration minister , has published a consultation document on his plans to reform the student visa system .
The Home Office press release is here and the consultation document is here .
The number of people from outside the EU coming to the UK on student visas has gone up from 272,000 in 1999 to 489,000 in 2009 , according to the document .
Green wants to cut these numbers drastically .
Here are his plans .
•
Issuing student visas only to people doing degree - level courses , or to people with highly - trusted sponsors .
•
Requiring students to show "" clear evidence of academic progression "" if they want to extend their study .
Students could be required to leave the UK and re - apply for a visa from abroad .
•
Stopping students doing courses involving a high level of work experience .
The minimum ratio of study to work is due to go up from 50:50 to 66:33 "" so that these type of courses become less attractive to people using them as a way to gain access to the UK employment market "" .
•
Imposing tougher English language requirements on students .
•
Limiting the amount of work students can do when they are studying .
•
Stopping dependents of students from being allowed to work .
•
Tightening the accreditation regime for colleges that take foreign students .
12.35pm : David Cameron does n't have his own Downing Street photographer any more .

12.59pm : Here 's a lunchtime summary .
•
Damian Green , the immigration minister , has published a consultation document on plans to cut the number of people coming to the UK with student visas .
"" I believe attracting talented students from abroad is vital to the UK but we must be more selective about who can come here and how long they can stay , "" he said .
"" People imagine students to be those who come here for a few years to study at university and then go home - that is not always the case .
Too many students coming to study at below degree level have been coming here to live and work , rather than studying .
We need to stop this abuse . ""
My colleague Alan Travis has the full story .

A
pro - Labour think tank has welcomed Kenneth Clarke 's plans to cut the prison population by putting more emphasis on rehabilitation and the use of community sentences .
Nick Pearce , director of the Institute of Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) said : "" It is very welcome to see a Conservative politician have the courage of his liberal convictions and argue that the prison population should fall , not rise .
Our prisons are overcrowded and locking so many people up costs this country a fortune .
More importantly , prison does n't work for many offenders - because a lack of rehabiliation schemes in prisons mean they are more likely to reoffend on release .
Well designed alternatives to prison for less serious offenders have been shown to work and they are much less costly . ""
Clarke said in an interview this morning that he wanted to end the "" bang 'em up "" culture .
"" We have to stop having this revolving door where people go in prison , serve their time and within less than a year half of them have committed more crime , "" he said .
( See 9.19am . )

David Cameron has said that he does not want the Wikileaks revelations to damage relations between Britain and Afghanistan .
He made his comments at a press conference in Kabul alongside the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
Cameron said the two countries had a strong relationship .
Karzai said the Afghan approach to the British was one of gratitude .
1.04pm :
My colleague Alan Travis points out that the figures in the student visa consultation document suggesting that there has been an 80 % increase in the number of students coming to the UK from outside the EU since 1999 ( see 12.18pm ) are misleading .
The 489,000 figure for 2009 includes multiple visits by the same person and "" student visitors "" - visitors who happened to be students but who were n't coming to the UK to study .
The "" student visitor "" category was only created 2007 .
Alan says that it is much better to compare the 272,000 figure for 1999 with 273,000 , the number of visas issued to students coming to study in the UK in 2009 .
Another 30,000 dependent visas were issued , taking the total for 2009 to around 300,000 .
That 's an increase of just over 10 % over 10 years .
The "" increased by nearly 80 % "" claim in the document is bogus .
1.27pm :
Shirley Williams ( Lady Williams ) has just been on the World at One defending the government 's plans to raise tuition fees .
She said that the proposals were "" very fair indeed "" because of the measures they include to help poor students and that social mobility was being "" at long last seriously addressed "" .
But she did say it was a mistake for Lib Dem candidates to sign the pledge before the election saying they would vote against a tuition fee increase .
When it was put to her that this did not reflect well on Nick Clegg , she said he did not know how bad the economic situation was going to be . ""
He did not have any idea at the time of the sheer scale of what we are up against , "" she said .
1.38pm :
The Tory MP Philip Davies has already criticised Kenneth Clarke 's sentencing plans today ( see 10.11am ) but he 's been expanding on his views on the Daily Politics show .
According to PoliticsHome , he complained that it was "" actually very difficult "" to get sentenced to prison these days .
I made a big thing in my election in Shipley that we would want to send more people to prison and provide more prison places ...
These panaceas that we 're always offered about fewer prison places and lower re - offending rates and less crime
, it 's just an absolute nonsense .
It 's actually very difficult to get into prison these days ...
Last year , almost 3,000 burglars with 15 or more previous convictions were n't sent to jail , over 4,500 violent offenders with 15 or more previous convictions were n't sent to jail .
People who went to court with over 100 previous convictions were more likely not to be sent to prison than sent to prison .
1.55pm : Reorganising the railways could cut running costs by up to £ 1bn a year , Philip Hammond , the transport secretary , said today .
He produced the figure as he published an interim report from Sir Roy McNulty , who has been reviewing the industry .
( McNulty says savings of this order could be achieved without services being cut , but not until 2018 - 19 . )
There are more details in this press notice from the department for transport .
This is from Hammond .
Incentives on the railway have become blurred and interests mis - aligned , to the detriment of efficiency , value for money and passenger satisfaction .
At present Network Rail answers to its regulator , not to its customers , the train operators .
Meanwhile , train operators have no interest in Network Rail 's costs , since any increases or decreases are passed straight through to the government .
This situation can not be allowed to continue .
All the players in the industry need to be pulling in the same direction in the interests of passengers and taxpayers .
Sir Roy McNulty has pointed the way and I am establishing a high - level group , which I will chair , to drive reform .
Hammond has also announced that he wants new rail franchises to last for longer .
In future they will last for around 15 years , instead of around seven years as they do now .
The West Coast Main Line franchise will be the first to be awarded on this basis , beginning in April 2012 .
2.29pm :
To be honest , it 's not the most exciting day on record here at Westminster .
If you want some really dramatic political news , try Dublin , where the finance minister Brian Lenihan is about to deliver a budget of such severity that it will make George Osborne look like Father Christmas .
My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering it on a live blog .
Apparently politicians face a 20 % pay cut .
2.48pm :
Maria Eagle , the shadow transport secretary , is n't impressed by Philip Hammond 's plans to save money through rail reorgansation .
( See 1.55pm . )
She 's put out this statement .
I share the coalition 's desire to see costs fall within the rail industry and welcome the work of the McNulty report that the last Labour government commissioned .
Yet all we 've seen today are more delays from the government as their plans for the future of rail franchises and industry reform are shunted into next year .
Since the election they have delayed the date for completion of Crossrail and Thameslink , delayed giving the green light to electrification of the Great Western Mail Line beyond Bristol and the Midland Main Line and delayed announcing the replacement of inter - city rolling stock .
The only thing not being delayed is the massive hikes in ticket prices that risk driving people off the railways and back onto the roads .
3.00pm : The IPPR has come out in favour of the government 's plans for sentencing reform today .
( See 12.59pm . )
But the pro - Labour think tank is n't very happy about the plans to cut the number of foreign students coming to the UK .
( See 12.18pm . )
This is from Sarah Mulley , an IPPR associate director .
Cuts in the number of foreign students will only have a limited impact on net migration levels over the long - term because so few stay permanently .
To have a serious impact the reduction of foreign students will need to be massive and will hit university and college income at a time of funding cuts .
Foreign students contribute a huge amount to the UK education sector and to the wider economy .
It is right to clamp down on abuse of the visa system but these proposals are driven primarily by the government 's objective of reducing net migration by more than half .
In its efforts to meet this objective , the government risks causing significant harm to a highly - successful export sector at a time when the economy is still vulnerable .
Half of foreign degree students actually start their studies in the UK on a sub - degree level course .
English language courses at UK colleges sell Britain and British business to the rest of the world .
3.09pm : Here 's an afternoon reading list .
•
David Hughes at the Telegraph has been reading the opening pages of Gordon Brown 's new book .
There is an extraordinary disclaimer in the opening pages of Gordon Brown 's Beyond The Crash which might go some way towards explaining our economic plight .
He writes : "" I am neither a finance expert nor a trained economist but fear of making technical mistakes ( of which , I am sure , this book is full ) should not silence us altogether when the task before us is so urgent . ""
Hang on .
Is n't this the chap who ran the UK economy for a decade ?
Who treated the Treasury 's expert officials with open contempt and relied instead on a handful of cronies ?
Who proclaimed the end of boom and bust , before presiding over the biggest bust since the 1930s ?
And all the while he was an amateur .
I 'll be jiggered .

Peter Kellner from YouGov says the polling figures show quite how much damage the tuition fees issue has done to the standing of the Liberal Democrats .
It 's clear from these figures that Clegg 's U - turn on tuition fees has played a big part in his party losing around half its General Glection vote .
My belief is that his problem is not just , or even mainly , about tuition fees as such .
Rather it is to do with the wider nature of his party 's image .
Past YouGov surveys have found that voters do n't like politicians who evade straight questions , break their promises , or try to spin their way out of awkward political corners .
A large part of the Lib Dems ' appeal in the spring was that they promised a different style of politics , more candid and more honest than Labour or the Conservatives .
Clegg fostered this image assiduously .
When Lib Dem MPs publicly signed the pledge to oppose tuition fees , they were not just asserting a particular education policy ; they were also seeking to exploit their reputation for a more decent form of politics .
That reputation now lies in tatters .

3.20pm :
Kenneth Clarke , the justice secretary , will be on his feet in the Commons soon to make a statement about the government 's rehabilitation and sentencing green paper .
He has already given an interview about this today to the BBC .
( See 9.19am . )
We 've already got a reasonable idea of what he 's going to propose .
But we do n't know how it 's going to go down well with Tory MPs .
And we have n't heard much yet from Labour about the plans .
So far they 've just been attacking them on the grounds that they involve spending cuts .
( See 9.39am . )
3.35pm :
Kenneth Clarke is making his statement now .
He says the government wants to make "" radical reforms "" to the criminal justice system .
Despite record spending , the criminal justice system ( CSJ ) is not delivering what really matters .
The CSJ "" falls short "" of what is required .
Around half of offenders released from prison reoffend within a year .
Three quarters of people sentenced to youth custody reoffend within a year .
Criminals must face "" robust and demanding "" punishments .
• Criminals to have to do more work in jail .
•
Community punishments to be made tougher .
•
Offenders to have to do more to provide compensation to victims .
3.38pm :
Clarke is still speaking .
He says more must be done to stop prisoners reoffending .
There will be a "" revolutionary shift "" in the way rehabilitation is funded and supplied .
Providers will be paid by results .
There will be more competition across offender management services .
3.39pm :
Clarke says 20 Acts have changed the sentencing framework over the last 10 years .
•
Sentencing laws to be simplified .
•
Community orders to be reformed , to give managers more discretion .
Dangerous offenders will still be managed responsibly .
•
Anyone who commits a crime with a knife can expect to be sent to prison .
There will be a further statement when the government publishes its response to the green paper consultation .
3.43pm :
Labour 's Sadiq Khan is speaking now .
He says the last government cut crime by 43 % between 1997 and 2010 .
Labour will support any "" sensible "" measures to reduce offending .
Can Clarke confirm that the entirety of the Conservative party 's manifesto on law and order has been "" put in the bin "" ?
Will Clarke confirm there has been a U - turn over knife crime ?
David Cameron promised increased prison capacity .
But there has been another U - turn .
The promises were a bluff .
The manifesto was "" a bluff on crime and a bluff on the causes of crime "" .
This review is all about reducing the prison population to cut costs , Khan says .
Can Clarke confirm that he will publish the detailed assumptions his officials have made about crime trends ?
Khan says he does not think there is a direct link between crime levels and the prison population .
But he does not agree with Clarke 's claim that there is no link at all .
There is some connection , Khan says .
Will Clarke accept that reoffending rates for women , young men and young offenders went down under Labour ?
Clarke is aiming at some of the right goals .
But cutting the justice department 's budget by 23 % will make it hard for him to achieve what he wants .
How can the Conservative party claim to be the party of law and order ?
Khan suggests the public could be at risk .
We could be in for a care in the community mark two , but this time with prisoners .
Khan accuses Clarke of "" complacency "" .
Labour will judge the measures by whether they make people safer .
3.50pm :
Kenneth Clarke is replying to Sadiq Khan now .
He says Khan did not criticise any of his proposals .
He says that when Khan was interviewed by the Guardian recently , he said that he did not disagree with anything Clarke had said .
The assumption that the prison population will fall by 3,000 is an estimate , Clarke says .
Clarke says the last government managed to get so many people sentenced to jail that they could not accommodate them all .
Some 80,000 prisoners had to be reduced early .
Clarke says most of the Ministry of Justice sayings do n't come from the prisons budget .
Would Labour spend more , he asks .
3.54pm : Kenneth Clarke says MPs from all parties support the need for more emphasis on rehabilitation .
3.55pm :
Labour 's Jack Straw asks Clarke why he wo n't acknowledge that crime fell under Labour .
Clarke says crime did fall under Labour , as it did across "" most of the Western world "" .
He quotes Newt Gingrich .
Gingrich said prison budgets should not always be protected .
Clarke says Alastair Campbell has also endorsed Clarke 's approach in his blog .
Clarke says he has the support of Newt Gingrich and Alastair Campbell ; Jack Straw is the representative of a "" failed past "" .
3.58pm :
Labour 's David Blunkett said he said much the same as Clarke has said about the importance of rehabilitation when he was home secretary .
But wo n't cuts in police spending make it impossible to cut crime ?
Clarke says that the government has to address the deficit .
4.00pm :
Edward Leigh , a Conservative , says communities deserve a break from crime .
Will burglars continue to go to prison ?
Yes , says Clarke .
"" I have read extraordinary suggestions that we are letting out burglars , robbers , "" Clarke says .
But that 's not true .
They are the "" core population "" of the jails .
4.04pm :
Tom Brake , a Lib Dem MP , asks how many vulnerable women will be spared jail as a result of these "" sensible "" proposals .
Clarke says he does not have a figure .
But there are some vulnerable women who should not be going to jail , he says .
4.05pm :
Keith Vaz , the Labour chair of the home affairs committee , says he supports the plans in principle .
But he wants to know if the government is still committed to sending anyone caught carrying a knife to jail .
Clarke says anyone caught using a knife should expect to go to jail .
As should anyone caught carrying a knife who might be about to use it .
But Clarke says he wants to avoid setting fixed sentences for specific crimes .
( As the BBC reported last night , the government has dropped its plans for automatic jail sentences for carrying a knife . )
4.10pm :
Labour 's Chuka Umunna asks for an assurance that cuts will not be imposed on Brixton prison .
Around 80 % of offenders there have short sentences , Umunna says .
Clarke says every department faces financial constraints .
It is not true to say that you can not make savings .
Competition will be used to keep costs down , he says .
4.13pm :
Clarke says he will consider allowing judges to impose higher sentences for dangerous driving .
4.15pm :
Clarke says it will take time to achieve the changes he is proposing .
4.18pm :
Labour 's Luciana Berger asks if more money will be available to pay for the rehabilitation measures proposed .
Clarke says that if Labour can not move on from the proposition that the solution to every problem involves spending more money , it will have no role in the government of this country .
4.20pm :
Clarke says the rules given to judges relating to how they explain their sentences are "" a hopeless mess "" and need to be changed .
4.22pm :
Priti Patel , a Conservative , asks if Clarke will ensure that paedophiles get locked up .
Clarke says that he sometimes feels he is listening to a "" loony tunes "" debate in this country .
He certainly believes in locking up paedophiles , he says .
He appeared to be calling Patel a loony !
I 'll post the full quote later .
4.25pm :
I 'd like to post a link to the green paper , but the most recent item on the Ministry of Justice website is about a "" best practice "" agreement signed with Russia last month .
I do n't remember that getting a lot of publicity .
4.29pm :
Paul Maynard , a Conservative , praises Clarke for ignoring "" the siren voices of populism "" that have been heard from both sides of the Commons .
4.31pm :
Labour 's John Mann asks if his community ( Bassetlaw ) can have an exemption from Clarke 's plans .
Clarke praised the work Mann has done on tackling drug crime in his constituency .
He says that Mann has shown that effective policy making is not all about money .
Clarke says he is not proposing that all repeat offenders should be spared jail .
4.38pm :
Clarke has finished his statement now .
I 'll wind up soon .
But first here 's what Clarke said to the Tory MP Priti Patel .
( See 4.22pm . )
She asked to reassure her constituents that dangerous criminals , such as paedophiles , would continue to receive robust jail sentences .
This is how Clarke replied :
Yes .
It 's sometimes quite difficult to debate law and order in this country .
I have occasionally to listen to a kind of loony tunes debate about whether I 'm starting by releasing murderers , rapists , burglars or paedophiles .
I believe serious criminals should be in prison .
I 've never met a sane person who wishes to disturb that .
I actually believe in long and severe sentences for people guilty of such a serious crime as paedophilia .
He was n't quite calling Patel a loony .
And , to be fair to her , she was asking Clarke to give an assurance to her constituents .
She was n't necessarily saying that she personally thought Clarke was about to let convicted paedophiles roam the streets .
But the exchange does provide a sense of what Clarke feels about his Tory critics .
5.17pm :
Here 's an afternoon summary .
• Kenneth Clarke has said that plans in his green paper on sentencing and rehabilitation will cut reoffending . ""
The green paper is an important change of direction in penal policy which will put more emphasis on reducing reoffending without reducing the punishment of offenders , "" he said .
"" By reforming criminals and turning them away from a life of crime we will break the cycle .
This will mean fewer crimes , fewer victims and safer communities .
"" Labour 's Sadiq Khan condemned Clarke for trying to achieve his aims when spending was being cut , but he did not criticise Clarke 's actual proposals .
Most government MPs were supportive , although a few Tory rightwingers expressed concern about the plans .
Clarke complained about having to put up with a "" loony tunes debate "" from people who accused him of wanting to release dangerous prisoners .

David Willetts , the universities minister , has released details of what universities will have to do to improve access to students from poor backgrounds .
"" I 'm emphasising to our universities that if they want to charge over £ 6,000 a year to our undergraduates , then I am looking to them to do everything they can to make sure they are attracting our brightest and best students , "" he said in a statement .
But Aaron Porter , president of the National Union of Students , said Willetts 's proposals would make little difference . ""
David Willetts is on another planet if he thinks that by telling universities to ' do all they can ' on access that they will actually do so , particularly the elite institutions which have such a woeful record on access for under - represented students , "" Porter said .

2010-12-08,"A new deal for military families – setting up talks with the banks to improve mortgage lending to members of the armed forces and a £ 10 m "" pupil premium "" to be paid to their children 's schools to fund additional pastoral care – will be announced by the government today .
David Cameron , speaking in Afghanistan where he met President Hamid Karzai and General David Petraeus , the American commander of international forces , said he wanted to ensure the "" inevitable disruption "" of military life did not cause greater problems for personnel and their families .
The government will today publish an armed forces bill , requiring ministers to update parliament every year on progress of the military covenant to strengthen the nation 's deal with the forces and their families .
The Ministry of Defence will also publish a report on the military covenant , commissioned by the coalition from Hew Strachan , professor of war history at Oxford University , which will highlight the growing problems facing military families in securing bank lending to buy a home . ""
A growing percentage of service personnel can experience difficulty in obtaining mortgages because they have a poor credit history , "" it will say .
The Treasury will chair talks between banks , representatives of the armed forces and the housing minister , Grant Shapps .
Service families ' credit ratings are often downgraded on account of the fact that they have to move around regularly .
"" The prime minister believes there is a real problem facing service families , through no fault of their own , and we want banks to get to the bottom of it , "" the prime minister 's official spokesman said .
Schools will be awarded extra funds for every child they accept from a military home under the pupil premium scheme , which is being introduced in April .
The scheme will reward schools for taking children from the poorest homes .
Children of forces families on average achieve better results than other pupils , but the government wants to give schools extra money to help with the pastoral care of children whose parents may be in combat and who regularly change schools as their parents are posted to different locations .
It will amount to a few hundred pounds for each child each year – adding up to as much as £ 10.8 m for the 36,000 pupils affected .
Cameron said : "" Our service personnel make an extraordinary contribution to British life .
Those serving on the front line risk their lives for us on a daily basis .
So all of us – the government , the private sector and voluntary organisations – need to go the extra mile for them .
I want to … make sure that the inevitable disruption associated with military life does not lead to greater problems .
It is important that service personnel are able to get their foot on the housing ladder the same way as other people do … and that their children are given the support they need at school . """
2010-12-15,"Mark Zuckerberg , the billionaire co - founder of Facebook , was today named Time magazine 's 2010 person of the year .
Zuckerberg , 26 , beat a string of notable personalities to the accolade – including WikiLeaks editor - in - chief Julian Assange and the president of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai .
The 33 rescued Chilean miners and the rightwing US Tea Party movement were also named as runners - up .
Time magazine 's annual accolade is given to the person or thing judged to have most influenced the culture and the news during the past year for good or for ill .
Zuckerberg was honoured "" for connecting more than half a billion people and mapping the social relations among them ; for creating a new system of exchanging information ; and for changing how we all live our lives "" , Time journalist Lev Grossman said .
The Time editor , Richard Stengel , announced the winner on NBC Television 's Today show .
Ben Bernanke , the cerebral American economist , took the prize last year , following US president Barack Obama in 2008 and Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin in 2007 .
The most notable runner - up is Assange , who is currently in prison pending an appeal against a decision yesterday to grant him bail over sexual allegations in Sweden .
Assange comfortably won the readers ' choice award for Time 's 2010 person of the year , announced earlier this week .
He beat Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the prime minister of Turkey , by more than 230,000 votes to scoop the prize .
Time 's decision has not gone down well among Assange 's supporters .
Many commenters on Time 's official announcement are critical of the magazine 's choice .
Matthias , for example , says : "" Why do you let people vote if you just pick your own candidate ?
Assange was first !
Shameless cowards . ""
Nello Margiotta commented : "" Mark Zuckerberg who ?
it 's only a political choice of the director of Time Magazine ; obviously for people in the net the person of the year is Julian Assange . ""
But Zuckerberg , a Harvard dropout , is marked out as one of the world 's youngest billionaires – and now one of the youngest recipients of Time 's prestigious accolade .
"" In less than seven years , Zuckerberg [ has ] wired together a twelfth of humanity into a single network , thereby creating a social entity almost twice as large as the US , "" said Grossman .
"" We have entered the Facebook age , and Mark Zuckerberg is the man who brought us here .
"" Zuckerberg is also an unlikely philanthropist .
Earlier this month , he pledged to give away at least half of his fortune to charitable causes as part of a campaign led by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and businessman Warren Buffett .
In September , Zuckerberg pledged to donate $ 100 m ( £ 63 m ) over five years to the Newark and New Jersey school system .
"" People wait until late in their career to give back .
But why wait when there is so much to be done ? "" said Zuckerberg last week .

2011-01-21,"Farooq Wardak , the Afghan education minister and a key ally of President Hamid Karzai , claims that the Taliban leadership no longer opposes education for girls .
The question is not whether this claim is true – teachers and students who continue to be terrorised by Taliban attacks would find it laughable – but why a senior Afghan official would engage in such misinformation .
The education ministry 's own statistics show that 20 schools were bombed or burned down between March and October 2010 .
At least 126 students and teachers were killed in the same period – an increase from the previous year .
It 's hard to know how many of these attacks were carried out by the Taliban , but the evidence in many cases points in their direction .
Attacks are often preceded by a threatening "" night letter "" like this one , sent last year to a school in Kunduz , in the north : "" You were already informed by us to close the school and not mislead the pure and innocent girls under this non - Muslim government …
This is the last warning to close the school immediately ...
If you remain in the province , remember that you along with your family will be eliminated .
Just wait for your death . ""
In another case , a female teacher received a letter that said : "" We Taliban warn you to stop working , otherwise we will take your life away .
We will kill you in such a harsh way that no woman has so far been killed in that manner .
This will be a good lesson for those women like you who are working . ""
Another teacher quit after receiving a letter with a Taliban insignia in October 2009 : "" We warn you to leave your job as a teacher as soon as possible , otherwise we will cut the heads off your children and we shall set fire to your daughter . ""
When I showed some of these letters to Wardak last July , he passed his eyes over them briefly , then cast them aside , saying : "" If we had time I could explain to you how I know that this is the handwriting of Pakistanis , not Afghans . ""
He went on to question whether Mullah Omar , the Taliban leader , really exists .
This was a startling lesson in revisionism about the Taliban .
Today , just as when the Taliban were in power pre-9/11 , some rural communities are able to negotiate with them to stop attacks on education .
Afghan parents want their children educated , including their daughters , and fight for it , even when it puts them at risk .
But the Taliban usually draws the line at educating girls over about age 10 , when puberty and demands to segregate the sexes take precedence .
And not all attacks are about gender .
Many schools and teachers are attacked as visible agents of the government in small rural communities or as symbols of western influence and teaching .
When in power the Taliban claimed that girls were being denied education only because of scant resources , a claim that Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef , the Taliban 's former ambassador to Pakistan , recently repeated .
However , when I interviewed Mullah Zaeef about attacks on education several years ago , he dismissed Human Rights Watch 's findings of systematic attacks as a fabrication .
Wardak plays down Taliban attacks on women and girls because he has become a leading government proponent of the need for reconciliation with the Taliban .
It suits his agenda to whitewash continuing Taliban crimes .
And , like many Afghan politicians , he prefers the conspiracy claims – that the Taliban are an entirely Pakistani creation , rather than confronting the messy reality of a home - grown movement that is as much a product of Afghan reality as of Pakistan 's intelligence agency .
There is a risk that some politicians in the UK , US and elsewhere , nervous about mounting casualties and dwindling public support for the war in Afghanistan , will seize on such claims .
Governments seeking an exit strategy may also find it convenient to play down Taliban abuses against women and girls .
While most women in Afghanistan desperately want peace , they do n't want a peace deal that is blind to the price they may pay .
That requires realism about the nature of the insurgency .
Although a comprehensive peace deal seems distant for now , small local deals are already taking place under the name of "" reintegration "" of Taliban fighters , with the promise of jobs and other enticements .
But there is no vetting system to stop a commander who is notorious for attacking girls ' education from becoming a local security chief , or even a district governor , with all the obvious risks to women and girls .
Instead of trying to soften the image of a group synonymous with the oppression of women and girls , the education minister should focus on increasing opportunities for their schooling , and on protecting girls ' education from attack .
Attacking schools is a war crime and should never be glossed over .
Those who threaten , bomb and burn down schools should instead be held to account ."
2011-02-07,"The Munich Security Conference adopted its characteristically upbeat tone on Afghanistan once again this year .
From President Hamid Karzai down , one speaker after another agreed that the strategy was working and steady progress was being made .
Karzai himself insisted his people were telling him that security was better than the year before , which was in turn better than the year before that .
For another point of view , it is worth taking a look at a new paper out today by New York University 's Centre on International Cooperation .
It is titled : "" Separating the Taliban from al - Qaida ; the core of success in Afghanistan "" and essentially argues that the current "" surge "" is taking the US and Nato further away from that critical goal .
The authors , Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn are researchers and writers based in Kandahar , and consequently have better access to the Taliban that just about anyone else writing on the subject .
They point out that when Osama bin Laden and his followers arrived in Afghanistan from Sudan in 1996 , they landed in Jalalabad where they were hosted by mujahedin commanders bin Laden knew from the war against the Soviet Union , not by the Taliban .
En route to capture Kabul in September 1996 , the Taliban took Jalalabad , thus inheriting custody of bin Laden and the group around him .
When the Taliban did inherit al - Qaida , they were split on how to deal with it .
While Mullah Omar saw bin Laden "" as an important connector to the wider Muslim world "" , a group around Mullah Mohammad Rabbani viewed him as nothing but trouble and an obstacle to international recognition .
But Rabbani died in April 2001 , marginalizing the internal opposition to the link and effectively sealing the fate of the Taliban regime .
When the US and its allies attacked , many Taliban went back to their villages , but the Bush policy of making no distinction between Taliban and al - Qaida meant they were often tracked down by US Special Forces .
Sitting it out was not an option .
The paper makes the argument that the Taliban insurgency was avoidable and that separating the old - school Taliban leaders from al - Qaida is not impossible .
It lists the signs the Taliban have sent to that effect , but says the leadership will play that card at the end of negotiations , not at the start .
The authors even quote "" a senior Taliban political strategist "" as envisioning the movement one day conducting counter - terrorist operations against al - Qaida , with US special forces along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
While this idea seems impossible to implement at present , it signifies considerable flexibility within the senior Taliban leadership
However , the authors argue that the ' decapitation strategy ' pursued by US and Nato troops under General David Petraeus is making an eventual deal less likely .
While there is ample manpower to fill the places of Taliban commanders killed and captured , the influx of more ideological and less nationalistic young members has weakened the leadership .
The likely outcome Strick and Kuehn say , is "" a still growing and ever more radical and largely leaderless insurgency "" .
If a political settlement is indeed being sought , there is little sense in trying to destroy the organisations one wants to talk to This argument is portrayed as dangerously illogical by most of the US and Nato military leadership , who say the Taliban will never negotiate unless and until they feel they are losing .
I talked to a member of the international contact group in Munich over the weekend who took a middle view .
Military pressure is essential he says , but he could see a situation in which the pressure , and the manner in which it is applied , becomes counter - productive . ""
That time is approaching , "" he said ."
2011-03-01,"The UK government is on track to deliver on its strategy in Afghanistan and remains "" cautiously optimistic "" about the progress made , David Cameron has said .
The prime minister met the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , in Downing Street to "" take stock "" and to discuss three priorities for the year : capitalising on the momentum created in the military campaign , the continuing to bolster the Afghan security forces , and beginning the process of transferring responsibility for security into Afghan hands .
Flanked by Karzai at a press conference , Cameron said the "" cautiously optimistic "" assessment he made on his last visit to British bases in Afghanistan , in December , was unchanged . ""
Real progress is being made every single day , with our support , "" he said .
While real challenges remained , Afghan forces were increasingly successful and would begin to take the lead in security matters this year .
There would be no UK forces in combat roles in Afghanistan by 2015 , Cameron said .
"" Taken together with the tangible inroads British troops are making in taking on the insurgency , including in its former heartlands in Helmand province , where British forces continue to push back the enemy in an extremely dangerous environment , there is , I believe , clear evidence that we have the right strategy , we have the resources to back it up , and we are on track to deliver it . ""
Cameron told Karzai Britain and Afghanistan would continue to "" have a very strong relationship "" after 2015 – "" a relationship based on diplomacy , on trade , on aid , on development , on military training [ and ] above all on friendship , because Britain is an all - weather friend , not a fairweather friend "" .
He told the Afghan president it was "" vital "" that he to took forward the wide - ranging reforms needed to help create "" a strong and sustainable Afghan state which the international community can go on investing in and supporting "" .
Alongside the military campaign , real progress on the political front was also crucial to ensure this year could be a decisive one for peace . ""
While the military campaign is while hugely important , it is only part of the equation .
So this year , we need real progress on [ an ] Afghan - led process of reconciliation and reintegration under which it is made clear to the insurgency that if they are willing to take certain steps – abandon violence , cut ties to al - Qaida , accept the basic tenets of the Afghan constitution – then they would be welcomed back into the mainstream of Afghan life .
"" It is time for the Taliban to start to make this journey and to make this year a decisive year for peace in Afghanistan . ""
Karzai offered the gratitude of the Afghan people to the UK , thanking British taxpayers for their financial support , and British servicemen and women for their sacrifices .
He said he was working towards a complete transition in 2014 , which would mean the whole country being looked after by Afghan forces and being under an Afghan system of governance by then .
But he said this would not mean a complete removal of the international presence in his country : countries such as the UK would continue to have a "" supportive role "" , in terms of training , and "" building capacity "" .
"" Afghanistan will be honoured to have an enduring relationship with the United Kingdom , "" said Karzai .
"" Afghanistan will try its best , its utmost , to take the help you provide to us and use it in a manner that will provide Afghan people with a better future , a peaceful future , a future in which Afghanistan will be a partner with you but not a burden for you as we move forward . ""
Cameron was questioned on the government 's decision to make 11,000 redundancies in the British armed forces – potentially including some troops who are now on the frontline in Afghanistan .
The prime minister conceded that cutting about 5,000 personnel from the army , 3,300 from the navy and 2,700 from the RAF would be "" difficult "" for those affected .
But he said the losses were necessary to "" modernise and update "" Britain 's forces in readiness for future challenges .
"" We do n't take any of these decisions lightly , and they will have a difficult impact on the people involved , "" he said .
"" And we must do everything we can to help them .
But it 's right to make the decisions and modernise the armed forces .
At the end of this process , we will still have probably the fourth largest defence budget anywhere in the world . ""
Yes , it is difficult taking these decisions .
But it is absolutely vital , because if you just stay where you are and you do n't modernise your armed forces , you will not be able to cope with the threats and difficulties that a nation like Britain will face in the future . """
2011-03-01,"David Cameron has stressed that the UK and international allies must plan "" for every eventuality "" in Libya , though he appeared to play down suggestions that the UK might directly arm opposition forces .
The prime minister said Britain 's immediate focus was to exert maximum effort to "" isolate and pressurise "" Muammar Gaddafi 's regime , during a brief press conference held with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , who is visiting London .
Pressed on the situation in Libya and the plans being put in place to ramp up the pressure on Gaddafi to step down , Cameron said it was the job of leaders and presidents to "" look around the corner "" and plan for every eventuality .
He vowed that the Libyan people "" would not be left to their fate "" in the face of some "" very immediate dangers "" from Gaddafi . ""
As I said , we should be planning now to see what we can to do to stop that , "" said Cameron .
But pressed to give further details of comments made on Monday to the Commons in which he said that the government "" should consider "" arming the opposition , the prime minister applied more measured tones .
He told journalists the government should be making contact and getting "" a greater understanding "" of the opposition forces , which have occupied Benghazi and control large parts of the north African country .
"" We are trying to step up our contact with them so we can get to know them better , what their intentions are , "" he said .
"" I do n't think we should go beyond that for now , but clearly we hope this will come to an end more quickly . ""
The international community should be working out what it can do to "" step up the pressure and keep that regime as isolated as it can be and hope that will bring it to an end , but be prepared for what might lie ahead "" , said the prime minister .
This was despite "" all sorts of legal and political difficulties "" , as well as "" difficulties of resources "" .
He said that the immediate priority was both the evacuation of British citizens from Libya , and applying "" maximum possible pressure "" both internationally and nationally .
The next stage was planning for the potential humanitarian crisis that could unfold unless events came to a quick end , he said .
But Cameron did not rule out the need for military action on the ground , if Gaddafi continued to use violence against his own people .
"" It is not acceptable to have a situation where Colonel Gaddafi can be murdering his own people , using aeroplanes and helicopter gunships and the like , "" he said .
"" And we have to plan now to make sure that if that happens we can do something to stop it , and that 's why I have said it 's right for us to plan – look at plans – for a no - fly zone .
That 's why I 've asked the chief of defence staff to do that . ""
And yes , we should also be making contact with , getting a greater understanding of , the opposition forces that are now in Benghazi and in control of quite a lot of the country .
"" We are trying to step up our contact with them so we can get to know them better – what their intentions are .
And I do n't think we should go beyond that for now , but clearly we hope this will come to an end more quickly . ""
But I think our job is to try and look around the corner and plan for every eventuality , and I note that other allies in Nato and the US are doing exactly the same thing .
And that is right . ""
He added : "" What I 'm going to be doing today , tomorrow and in the future is making sure that we are doing everything we can to get the international community to think ahead about what might be necessary to try and bring this to an end as quickly as possible . ""
Cameron , who chaired the national security council this morning , said discussions involved looking at what more could be done with allies to ensure events in north Africa and the Middle East led to a "" democratic awakening and not a time of risk and difficulty "" .
Cameron confirmed on Monday that Britain supported sanctions agreed by the EU , including an arms embargo , an assets freeze and visa ban .
The prime minister spoke to the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , later in the day , when the two leaders agreed that French and British experts should work together on "" policy options "" , and that there should be an early European council meeting to discuss further measures to isolate the regime .
European leaders are likely to meet towards the end of next week to discuss how to broaden and strengthen sanctions against the Libyan regime in an attempt to force Gaddafi to step down , according to the prime minister 's spokesman ."
2011-03-02,"Afghanistan 's small band of independent - minded media outlets is a little smaller with the demise of Kabul Weekly , a lively newspaper that claims it has been put out of business after daring to criticise Hamid Karzai .
On Wednesday staff met with their editor , Mohammad Faheem Dashty , for the final time after producing the last edition of a newspaper that has been a regular sight on the streets of the capital since 2002 .
Dashty said he had no choice but to shut down after more than a year of losses in a media market where most publications are simply bankrolled by warlords . ""
To preserve our independence we tried to rely on the normal revenue streams of newspapers around the world , advertising and subscriptions , but in Afghanistan everything is political , "" he said .
After years of modest profitability , things went awry during the 2009 presidential election when Kabul Weekly earned the ire of Karzai 's presidential campaign with a front - page article claiming the president was looking weak after allegedly losing the support of Afghanistan 's western backers .
Karzai 's campaign manager , who now serves as his official spokesman , promptly dropped the political ads it had been running in the paper .
But more serious was the drying up of advertising from the country 's biggest companies , including banks and airlines , although Dashty wo n't say which ones . ""
All these companies were financing the presidential campaign so they could make back their money through legal and illegal contracts after he won , "" he said .
The demise of a paper that has been vocal in its opposition to Karzai further concentrates media power in Afghanistan in the hands of powerful interest groups .
The hundreds of newspapers , radio and television stations that have sprung up since 2001 are nearly all paid for either directly by the government or by a motley band of still powerful warlords who use newspapers and television stations to beat the drum for their own , often ethnic , interests .
"" This one is paid for by the Iranians , this one the Americans , "" Dashty says as he tosses a pile of the day 's papers – which he claims are bankrolled by foreign intelligence services – across his desk in his central Kabul office .
"" This one is a daily with a print run of 10,000 , no adverts and it is not sold anywhere – how do they pay for that ? ""
Government antipathy towards Kabul Weekly was not helped by the fact that Dashty is the nephew of Abdullah Abdullah , Karzai 's main challenger in the presidential election .
But the editor denies any bias , pointing to the paper 's habit of "" criticising almost everyone "" , including his own father , a former government official , who was attacked in Kabul Weekly 's pages for failing in his official role to keeping the country 's mountainous roads open .
"" There is no such thing as total independence , "" said Dashty .
"" But we did our best . """
2011-03-07,"Blackwater looks set to survive an Afghan government clampdown on mercenaries after Hamid Karzai was forced by his western partners to abandon a complete disbandment of private security companies .
Under plans to be announced by the Afghan government this month many security contractors , whom Karzai regards as being little better than militias , will be allowed to continue operating for another year .
As part of a complex new transition strategy the government is giving them until 21 March 2012 before most security for development projects is taken over by the Afghan Public Protection Force .
The APPF is a government security service intended to assume control over the country 's hugely lucrative commercial security industry , which employs around 30,000 guards .
Western and Afghan officials say the draft plans drawn up by former Karzai opponent Ashraf Ghani will actually allow companies to keep supplying private guards and security services to development projects indefinitely .
According to a list seen by The Guardian 11 companies operating in Afghanistan that have a good reputation with government officials will enjoy favoured status in taking over contracts .
Xe Services , formerly known as Blackwater , is included in that group despite being banned in Iraq and notorious for its activities in Afghanistan .
Seven companies deemed too closely linked to senior Afghan officials have been sent orders to disband within 90 days .
They include NCL , which is owned by the son of the defence minister and has interests in a $ 2.2bn US government transport contract .
Another company , Watan , is frantically trying to win a stay of execution by arguing that its owners , the Popal brothers , are not as closely related to the Karzai family as widely believed .
Karzai had previously described the companies as "" thieves by day , terrorists by night "" .
Last August he wanted them all disbanded by the end of 2010 .
That decree sparked months of chaos and acrimonious wrangling between Karzai and his overseas allies .
The foreign ministry refused to issue new visas to foreign guards .
"" Karzai is doing what the Americans are telling him to do because he has no choice , "" said a senior western diplomat .
"" But if he thought in terms longer than just the next 24 hours he would not have got himself into this mess . ""
Karzai is said to be unhappy with parts of the new plan .
He must give it his assent before it is due to come into effect on 21 March , the Afghan new year .
David Petraeus , the top US commander in Afghanistan , has helped to put pressure on Karzai .
Afghan officials are acutely aware that without a bridging agreement billions of US aid dollars could be threatened by the general 's forthcoming testimony to the US Congress on the security situation in Afghanistan .
Karzai had already conceded that embassies and Nato , which rely on private guards to protect supply convoys , could continue to use security companies .
But questions remained over development projects , such as road construction , that the US regard as essential for winning over ordinary Afghans .
Under the new plan companies guarding reconstruction projects will be able to have 500 of their own guards , or up to 1,000 if they pay a one - off fine .
For contracts requiring more than that the companies will be expected to recruit , train , arm and pay new APPF guards who will then take control of the contract after 12 months .
If the APPF proves not up to the job the private company will continue to be in control , according to the draft proposal .
Many officials think that is likely . ""
Building up Afghan capacity so that it is big enough , is clean and not corrupt is a huge task that I think could take at least two years , "" said General Manan Farahi , a senior adviser to the country 's interior minister who has been closely involved in the issue .
Kabul 's expatriate security contractors will be able to reinvent themselves as consultants to the APPF .
"" There 's no incentive in it for the companies who are being asked to train up these guards and then just hand them all over with all their equipment , "" said a manager for a large security company .
"" But most of us will keep our jobs as consultants and be simply rehired ...
Most of my clients want to see an expat to keep an eye on things . ""
Blackwater 's clean slate Eyebrows were raised among Kabul 's security contractors when it emerged this month that one of the most notorious companies in the industry was deemed free of any offences .
Out of 52 companies on a list of security providers drawn up by the Afghan government Blackwater , or Xe Services as the US company is now known , was among nine considered to be in good standing .
That is despite a 2009 incident when two allegedly drunk employees working for a subsidiary company killed two Afghans after opening fire on their car .
Most of the other companies scrutinised by officials were deemed guilty of considerably less serious crimes , including possession of unregistered guns , having too many guards and tax violations that they will have to rectify in order to keep operating .
A US Senate inquiry has found that the Blackwater subsidiary , called Paravant , illegally signed out 500 machine guns from a US military store under the name Eric Cartman , the South Park character .
In September a US court declared a mistrial in the case of the two contractors involved in the 2009 Kabul shooting .
A jury considering claims that the men were acting in self - defence was unable to reach a unanimous verdict .
That the CIA - connected company remains welcome in Afghanistan , where it works on huge contracts to train up the Afghan security forces , is in sharp contrast to Iraq .
The Iraqi government refused to renew its operating licence after Blackwater contractors were involved in a notorious 2007 shootout that let 17 civilians dead .
It prompted the company to change its name to Xe Services ."
2011-03-08,"The vexed question of the terms under which US forces should remain in Afghanistan after the official pullout date of 2014 will be thrown open to the Afghan people , Hamid Karzai has promised .
In a speech marking International Women 's Day , Karzai said that a loya jirga , or gathering of tribal grandees , would be held as soon as Washington and Kabul had finished negotiating a long - term deal .
Karzai 's spokesman said it was too early to say whether it would be a full court loya jirga , like the one convened in 2003 to approve the Afghan constitution , or more like the consultative "" peace jirga "" called last summer to consider peace talks with the Taliban .
The issue of whether to allow permanent bases for US forces has sparked a heated debate .
Anti - Americanism , fuelled by botched military operations and civilian deaths , is at an all - time high .
Many religious leaders have condemned the plan .
One senior diplomat in Kabul told the Guardian it was unlikely a loya jirga would approve the long - term stay of US soldiers .
But most Afghan officials believe bases are vital for protecting the country from meddling by Pakistan , Iran and India .
In confidential US cables released by WikiLeaks , it was revealed that the Afghan president had offered Kandahar and Bagram airfields as permanent US property .
The US ambassador , Karl Eikenberry , told Karzai the US had no interest in permanent bases – something the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , has repeated .
However , a long - term presence looks inevitable with few Nato officials believing the Taliban insurgency will be stamped out by 2014 .
Karzai is increasingly focused on the transition from Nato to Afghan control of security , and will soon announce which provinces will be handed over first .
He also called for the removal of Nato 's provincial reconstruction teams , security companies and a flagship local policing initiative he described as being little better than "" militias "" ."
2011-03-10,"At a time of unprecedented tension between the west and Hamid Karzai over the killing of civilians , Nato has accidentally shot dead one of the Afghan president 's own family members during a botched night raid .
Officials in the southern province of Kandahar said Haji Yar Mohammad Karzai , a second cousin of the president , was killed during an operation by US special forces in Karz , the ancestral Karzai home on the outskirts of Kandahar city .
In what appears to have been a major intelligence failure , the 63-year - old tribal elder was mistaken for the father of a Taliban commander .
This week the UN released figures showing the total number of civilians killed last year by the coalition and the Taliban reached an all - time high of 2,777 , reflecting an escalation of violence by both sides .
Mahmoud Karzai , one of the president 's brothers , said he "" smelled a very deep conspiracy "" over the killing of Haji Yar Mohammad and said he feared Nato had been fed false information by someone from within the Karzai family .
In keeping with the Islamic tradition of burying people within 24 hours of death , senior tribal leaders , including president Karzai 's powerful half brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai , gathered in Karz for the funeral on Thursdayafternoon .
Karzai 's spokesman , Waheed Omar , said the president was informed of the death in the morning and ordered an immediate investigation by Afghan security forces .
"" Like always with any other civilian casualty the president was saddened because he takes the loss of life extremely seriously , "" he said .
Accounts of events from people in the village varied in small details , but all agreed that the operation happened sometime after midnight morning and that US soldiers were involved .
"" There were many tanks that came and surrounded the house , but they did not attack any other building , "" said Haji Padshah .
"" The Americans went in , brought out Haji Mohammad and shot him . ""
Ahmadullah Nazak , chief of Dand district , where Karz is located , added that two of his bodyguards and a neighbour were arrested .
"" We do n't know why the operation was carried out in his village , whether he was [ targeted ] or somebody else , "" he said .
morning Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) initially claimed that its forces had killed the "" father "" of a Taliban commander who was wanted for his role in making car bombs .
In the lead story of Isaf 's daily "" morning operational update "" the coalition said it had successfully "" captured a Taliban leader , killed one armed individual and detained several suspected insurgents "" .
After ordering everyone to leave the building so they could search it someone spotted "" an armed individual with an AK-47 in an adjacent building within the compound "" .
The statement continued : "" The security force assessed the male as an immediate threat to the security force , and engaged him .
The individual killed was the father of the targeted individual . ""
In the late afternoon , after news had broken that Karzai had been killed , the coalition published an "" update "" correcting its initial claim that the dead man was the father of an insurgent and saying an inquiry had been launched .
Aktar Mohammad , a neighbour of Karzai , said the old man had a gun to defend his property , like everyone else in the village .
Mahmoud Karzai , one of the president 's brothers , said the killing was a "" shocking development "" and said he could not understand why Nato forces would be hunting down insurgents in the town of Karz , which is in the relatively peaceful district of Dand . ""
Karz is our stronghold , there are absolutely no Taliban there
and there never will be , "" he said .
Despite the Karzai family 's grip on power for nearly 10 years , Karz remains a relatively poor and undeveloped village surrounded by farmland .
Mahmoud Karzai said he believed there was a "" deep conspiracy "" behind the killing harking back to a family feud during the jihad against the Soviet Union of the 1980s when Yar Mohammad killed one of his cousins , Khalilullah Karzai .
The 30-year - old dispute was widely cited as the reason why Yar Mohammad 's 18-year - old son , Waheed , was shot dead in Karz in October 2009 .
"" If this is a deliberate set - up where the US military is being given false information to settle a personal vendetta then this is very serious , "" Mahmoud Karzai said .
If true , embarrassment over a blood feud within Afghanistan 's most powerful family might have prompted the relatively subdued response by Karzai to the killing .
Ahmed Wali Karzai said the killing was a mistake and that the dead man had been carrying a weapon because he was threatened by the Taliban . ""
These misfortunes happen every day , "" he said .
Nonetheless , the murder of a relative in a country where family and tribe is all important could stoke recriminations over Nato blunders .
The timing of the incident is extremely unfortunate as Karzai has recently increased his criticism of the Nato - led coalition for killing civilians , particularly after the recent killing of nine young boys in the eastern province of Kunar who were mistaken for insurgents .
In November Karzai called on the coalition to stop the "" kill and capture "" night raids that Nato commanders say have been highly effective in disrupting insurgent networks .
Although figures released by the UN on Wednesday showed that in 2010 75 % of civilian deaths were caused by insurgents , Karzai has tapped into public anger at the accidents of foreign troops , in part to confound the widespread view that he is a puppet of the US .
He even went so far as to reject an apology issued by the US commander , David Petraeus after the killing of the boys in Kunar ."
2011-03-10,"A furious row between Nato - led forces and the Afghan president over the killing of civilians looks set to turn into a full - blown crisis after an elderly cousin of Hamid Karzai was killed during a botched Nato operation .
Officials in the southern province of Kandahar confirmed that Haji Yar Mohammad Karzai , a second cousin of the president , was accidentally shot during an overnight operation in the family village of Karz .
Senior tribal leaders , including Karzai 's powerful brother Ahmed Wali Karzai , had gathered for the funeral in keeping with the Islamic tradition of burying the dead within 24 hours .
Athough details are scarce , it appears that a major intelligence failure could have been responsible for the deaths after Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) issued a statement correcting an earlier press release that had claimed a man killed in operations in the area was the father of a Taliban leader .
The original statement said the Taliban leader was being targeted for distributing materials to make car bombs that were being used throughout Kandahar province .
It said soldiers had approached a compound and called for all the people inside to come out so they and the building could be searched .
Deadly force was used after a man was seen carrying a weapon , according to the first statement : "" A member observed an armed individual with an AK-47 in an adjacent building within the same compound .
The security force assessed the male as an immediate threat to the security force , and engaged him .
The individual killed was the father of the targeted individual .
The leader and suspected insurgents were detained as a result of initial questioning at the scene .
"" The new statement said the coalition was "" now aware of conflicting reports about the identities of those involved "" and an inquiry had been launched .
Karzai 's spokesman , Waheed Omar , said the president had ordered an immediate investigation by Afghan security forces . ""
Like always with any other civilian casualty the president was saddened because he takes the loss of life extremely seriously , "" Omar said .
Details of what happened are still unclear , although one senior member of the Alokozai tribe , who attended the funeral , said the attack took place at some point after midnight and American soldiers were responsible . ""
There were many tanks that came and surrounded the house , but they did not attack any other building , "" said Haji Padshah .
"" The Americans then went in , brought out Haji Mohammad and shot him . ""
Ahmadullah Nazak , district chief of the area , said two of his bodyguards and a neighbour were arrested in the operation .
"" We do n't know why the operation was carried out in his village , whether he [ Karzai 's cousin ] was aimed at or somebody else .
He was an old man at the age of 60 , he had no official job , "" Nazak said .
Mahmoud Karzai , another of the president 's brothers , said the killing was a "" shocking development "" and he could not understand why Nato forces would be hunting for insurgents in Karz , which is in the relatively peaceful district of Dand , not far from Kandahar City . ""
Karz is our stronghold , there are absolutely no Taliban there
and there never will be , "" Mahmoud Karzai told the Guardian .
He said he "" smelled a very deep conspiracy "" behind the episode , possibly involving a family feud within the Karzai clan that goes back to the jihad period of the 1980s . ""
If this is a deliberate setup where the US military is being given false information to settle a personal vendetta then this is very serious , "" he said .
"" I hope there is a full investigation . ""
He said the president was not close to his cousin and they had not seen each other for a long time .
Nonetheless , the murder of a relative in a country where family and tribe is all - important is likely to stoke government rage at Nato blunders .
The timing of the incident is especially unfortunate as Karzai has been ratcheting up his criticism of the Nato - led coalition for killing civilians , particularly after nine boys were killed recently when an attack helicopter mistook them for insurgents .
Although figures released by the United Nations on Wednesday showed that 75 % of civilian deaths in 2010 were caused by insurgents , Karzai has tapped into public rage at the accidents of foreign troops , in part to confound the widespread view that he is a puppet of the US .
He even rejected an apology made by General David Petraeus , commander of Nato and US forces in Afghanistan , after the incident with the nine boys ."
2011-04-03,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , appears to have added fuel to the violent protests in Afghanistan after calling on the US Congress to condemn a Christian preacher 's burning of the Qur'an .
Karzai 's demand came despite a statement from Barack Obama denouncing the behaviour of American pastor Terry Jones as "" an act of extreme intolerance and bigotry "" .
But the Afghan president , in a meeting on Sunday with the US ambassador , Karl Eikenberry , and David Petraeus , the US commander of Nato forces in the country , demanded that the top US lawmaking body should condemn Jones .
The report of the national security council meeting , issued by Karzai 's office , highlights the concern of some analysts that the president is pandering to the demands of anti - western protesters rather than attempting to quell violence that has already cost dozens of lives , including the seven UN officials killed by a mob in Mazar - e - Sharif on Friday .
On Sunday violence continued for a second day in the Taliban heartland city of Kandahar , with at least one person killed , while protests also raged in Jalalabad where students blocked a road to Kabul .
Karzai has been bitterly criticised by some for drawing attention to the Qur'an fire in the first place .
Though it was largely ignored by the media , Karzai issued a press release on 24 March , four days after the book - burning in Gainsville , Florida , condemning the "" crime against a religion and entire Muslim umma [ community ] "" .
He said the US and UN should "" bring to justice the perpetrators of this crime "" .
Western officials showed their dismay .
Petraeus issued a statement with Nato 's Kabul ambassador , Mark Sedwill , condemning "" any disrespect to the holy Qur'an and Muslim faith "" .
Jones has claimed the FBI told him a $ 2.4 m bounty had been put on his head in Pakistan .
In interviews he said he was "" saddened "" by the violence .
He had promised in September not to set fire to the book , then he and his congregation discussed shredding , shooting , or dunking it in water instead .
Jones said his desire to shed light on the "" dangerous book "" won out , so the burning was streamed on the internet , with Arabic subtitles to reach Muslims . ""
For some of them , "" he said , "" it could be an awakening . """
2011-05-02,"Hamid Karzai 's reaction to the news of Osama bin Laden 's violent death in Pakistan could be best summed up as ' I told you so . '
Speaking in front of a packed hall in his palace in Kabul , the Afghan president said the discovery that the world 's most wanted man was holed up in a garrison town in Pakistan proved that the west 's entire military strategy is misconceived . ""
Year after year , day after day , we have said the fighting against terrorism is not in the villages of Afghanistan , not among the poor people of Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" The fight against terrorism is in safe havens .
It proves that Afghanistan was right . ""
In recent months Karzai has become increasingly strident in his criticism of the US - led coalition , saying it has focused on counter - insurgency operations in the Pashtun south of the country rather than the Taliban safe havens over the border .
He also hinted that the Pakistani state itself was complicit in hiding the Saudi terrorist leader , saying Bin Laden had "" hidden himself in the military bases of Abbottabad "" .
But the Afghan president appealed for peace with Pakistan , saying "" I want good relations with the neighbouring countries whatever they have done . ""
And he called on the Taliban to stop killing their fellow Afghans , asking "" who are you fighting for ? "" .
Although the killing of Bin Laden will strengthen Karzai 's argument with the US , some analysts and officials expressed fears that his demise could hasten the end of the huge US - led military and development effort in Afghanistan . ""
While thrilled to see the removal of the worst enemy of Islam who inflicted irreparable damage to image of Islam and Muslims , my concern is his death becomes the justification for US premature disengagement from the region , "" one senior Afghan government official who specialises in foreign affairs said .
It was a view echoed by Ahmed Wali Massoud , an Afghan politician and brother of Ahmed Shah Massoud , the legendary resistance fighter who was assassinated just days before the September 11 attacks in 2001 on the orders of Bin Laden . ""
Already the US has been thinking about shifting its policy on the war on terror and there is a risk that the American public will continue to question why their troops are still fighting there , "" he said .
But Massoud warned that his killing would not make "" any practical difference to the war in Afghanistan "" . ""
Symbolically this is huge because he was such an iconic figure , but this is not the end .
Al - Qaida is still there and there are so many other groups that are just as ideologically strong . ""
The younger generation of the Taliban have come up and they now make up the bulk of the Taliban ideologically and are not very different from al - Qaida itself .
We believe there is still scope for operations in Afghanistan , because the threat is still here . ""
Despite recent reports that al - Qaida has tried to re - establish a foothold in Afghanistan , particularly in mountainous areas of the north - east where US troops have pulled back , analysts have long declared that the group is largely irrelevant to the fighting in Afghanistan .
But other experts said that far from being a setback , the killing of Bin Laden could improve the chances of peace .
Michael Semple , a former EU diplomat who was expelled from the country in 2007 for talking to the Taliban , said the death of Bin Laden "" removes any illusions that al - Qaida was a force to reckon with in Afghanistan "" .
"" This gives America an ideal opportunity to play its needed role in responsibly winding down the conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan , "" said Semple , who works as an academic at Harvard .
He added that the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , the US military outfit that runs "" kill and capture "" operations against insurgents , needed to take a back seat after a huge intensification of its efforts in the last year .
He said : "" This of course will require diplomacy rather than just counter - terror .
JSOC has played its role , now it 's time for state "" .
The fact that the raid happened inside Pakistani territory where the Afghan Taliban enjoy sanctuary could also put pressure on the insurgent high command to come to the negotiating table , he said .
Taliban spokesmen said they were suspicious of early media reports of Bin Laden 's death and said they would reserve comment until they were certain it was true .
But one Taliban commander , who escaped from Kandahar prison last week , told the Guardian he had no doubts and was "" very sad "" at the news because "" the Americans will be happy "" . ""
In the Islamic countries Osama is a respected person .
I hope Muslims join with us after this killing and stand beside us against the Americans , "" he said , speaking by phone from an unknown location .
He warned it would make no difference to the strength of the insurgency inside Afghanistan .
"" We have lost thousands of people , but every year we get stronger , "" he said .
"" We do not rely on foreigners to fight or us .
Almost 500 people escaped with me from Kandahar prison and they were all Afghans .
There were no foreigners . ""
On the streets of Kabul this morning public reaction was muted .
"" Thousands of people die every day and he is just one of the thousands , "" said Zaikira , a 49-year - old money changer .
"" It wo n't change the war .
We have had fighting in Afghanistan for centuries , and it will continue for hundreds more . """
2011-05-02,"Pakistan 's government is facing deeply uncomfortable questions in the US and beyond over the presence of Osama bin Laden near a military facility less than two hours from the capital , Islamabad – and angry claims from Afghanistan that its own position has been vindicated .
Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , hinted that the Pakistani state itself was complicit in sheltering the terrorist leader , saying Bin Laden had "" hidden himself in the military bases of Abbottabad "" .
The killing has revived questions about alleged links between al - Qaida and elements in the country 's security forces .
Ironically , only 10 days ago Pakistan 's army chief addressed cadets at that town 's military academy – the equivalent of Sandhurst in the UK or West Point in the US – claiming the army had broken the back of militants linked to al - Qaida and the Taliban .
Islamabad had long insisted that Bin Laden was not hiding in Pakistan but in neighbouring Afghanistan , but tensions with the US had mounted in recent months over cross - border drone attacks and the government 's faltering efforts to tackle the Pakistani Taliban .
Pervez Musharraf , president of Pakistan from 2001 to 2008 , described Bin Laden 's death as a "" positive step "" , but criticised the US for launching the raid within his country 's borders .
Calling it a victory for the people of Pakistan , Musharraf said he also expected some short - term instability due to acts of revenge .
"" It 's a very positive step and it will have positive long - term implications , "" Musharraf told Reuters in Dubai , where he has a home . ""
Today we won a battle , but the war against terror will continue . ""
Musharraf said , however , that the operation infringed on Pakistan 's sovereignty : "" It 's a violation to have crossed Pakistan 's borders . ""
But suspicions of complicity will centre on the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan 's powerful security and spy agency , which is widely considered untrustworthy by its western partners .
"" For some time there will be a lot of tension between Washington and Islamabad because Bin Laden seems to have been living here close to Islamabad , "" Imtiaz Gul , a Pakistani security analyst , told Reuters . ""
Pakistan will have to do a lot of damage control .
This is a serious blow to the credibility of Pakistan . ""
In Kabul , Karzai seized on the news of Bin Laden 's death to criticise the US - led coalition , complaining that it was focused on counter - insurgency operations in the Pashtun south of Afghanistan rather than Taliban safe havens over the border . ""
Year after year , day after day , we have said the fighting against terrorism is not in the villages of Afghanistan , not among the poor people of Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" The fight against terrorism is in safe havens .
It proves that Afghanistan was right . ""
Aminuddin Muzafary , secretary of the High Peace Council established by Karzai , said Bin Laden 's death "" removed the curtain from Pakistan 's face . ""
He added : "" His death shows the unfaithfulness of Pakistan but it is also possible that it was a business deal between the CIA and the ISI .
Time will reveal whether or not this was a deal or something else . ""
The news was "" very worrying , "" said Abdullah Abdullah , Afghanistan 's top opposition leader .
"" Just a few weeks ago the Pakistanis were insisting that the US military and intelligence operations should be stopped in Pakistan and their agents should leave the country .
"" Afghanistan 's intelligence service has long believed that their Pakistani counterparts were harbouring Bin Laden .
Last year , shortly after he was sacked by Karzai , Amrullah Saleh , the former head of the National Directorate of Security , claimed the ISI knew exactly where the al - Qaida leader was hiding .
Saleh told the Guardian that the Pakistani state deliberately kept Bin Laden safe so that the west would ignore its nuclear programme .
He said : "" They built their nuclear bomb under the very watchful eyes of the west .
How did they escape from that danger ?
By creating another crisis for you .
If I make an analogy – you have a pain in your finger and pain in your kidney , which one [ do ]
you go [ for ] first ?
They created a kidney pain for United States through Bin Laden and Taliban so you give up talking about the pain from the nuclear bomb .
"" Elements within the ISI have long been accused of sympathy for militant Islamism and of aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan and insurgents in Kashmir as part of their regional rivalry with India .
The Indian home ministry issued a statement expressing "" concern that terrorists belonging to different organisations find sanctuary in Pakistan "" .
In London the Pakistani high commissioner , Wajid Shamsul Hasan , insisted that Islamabad had no idea of Bin Laden 's whereabouts until the US operation .
"" Nobody knew that Osama bin Laden was there – no security agency , no Pakistani authorities knew about it , "" Hasan told BBC Radio 5 Live .
"" The fact is that the Americans knew it and they carried out the operation themselves and they killed Osama bin Laden and then later our president of Pakistan was informed that the operation was successful , and that 's it . ""
But the chairman of parliament 's foreign affairs committee Richard Ottaway said : "" Unfortunately , I am not sure that the government of Pakistan speaks for the whole of Pakistan .
It is a divided country with lots of tribal loyalties , and there are clearly internal divisions within Pakistan 's security services ."
2011-05-05,"Thousands of Afghans have attended a heated rally in Kabul decrying peace talks with the Taliban in a show of strength by those opposing any return to power of the hardline movement .
Crowds carrying green flags and wearing ribbons of the newly established National Movement gathered under a vast series of tented canopies in the capital days after the event was called on Monday – the same day that news broke that Osama bin Laden had been killed by US special forces in Pakistan .
The killing of the man who was sheltered by the Taliban regime in the 1990s has prompted heady speculation that an "" end game "" to the 10-year conflict could now be at hand , with the Afghan government under President Hamid Karzai and the Taliban - led insurgency striking a deal .
But "" deal making "" were dirty words to the crowd gathered at the rally in Kabul on Thursday morning .
Banners lining the tent said "" We did n't vote for Karzai to make deals , "" and "" Do n't sacrifice justice for dealing . ""
Speeches were interrupted several times by chants from the crowd of "" Death to the Taliban .
Death to the suicide bombers .
Death to the Punjabis
"" – a reference to the demonstrators ' view that the Taliban is under the control of Pakistan 's spy service .
The event was organised by Amrullah Saleh , the country 's former spy chief and outspoken critic of Karzai 's efforts to reach out to the Taliban .
Saleh , a burly and comparatively young man who earned the respect of the CIA during his sometimes brutal leadership of Afghanistan 's intelligence service , received a rapturous reception from the flag - waving crowd when he marched into the tent with a phalanx of bodyguards .
Speaking to a crowd that organisers claimed , not unreasonably , was about 15,000 strong , Saleh said he had "" for years "" warned that al - Qaida and the Taliban were being protected in Pakistan , something that had been "" proved "" by the killing of Bin Laden in a Pakistani garrison town this week .
Saleh said efforts to reach out to the Taliban ignored what he claimed was the vast majority of people who oppose the insurgents .
And he expressed anger at Karzai 's description of the Taliban as disaffected "" brothers "" .
"" They are not my brother , they are not your brother –
those are our enemies , "" he told the cheering crowd .
Since being sacked by Karzai last year , Saleh has been developing a political profile for himself , travelling the northern regions of the country to warn people of Karzai 's peace plans and recruit people to his cause .
But Thursday 's event , held outside a gaudy wedding hall on one of the city 's busiest roads , appeared to be a deliberate effort by the party to burst on to the national scene as a force to be reckoned with .
Unusually for a political rally in Afghanistan , the master of ceremonies was a woman , who welcomed the crowds and introduced the speakers .
It appeared part of an effort to highlight the Taliban 's harsh treatment of women , who during the Taliban government were restricted from education , employment and even venturing out of their homes without a male relative .
Although aides to Saleh said he had been planning the event for the past two weeks , his rapid mobilisation of so many people since Monday highlighted one of the main pitfalls on the road to a possible negotiated peace with the Taliban – that it would not be accepted by many Afghans , particularly those who are not Pashtuns , the country 's largest ethnic group .
Some have even warned that a rapid peace deal could rekindle civil war in the country , particularly as the strongest opposition to a Taliban return to power comes from within the ranks of the Northern Alliance , the old coalition of largely non - Pashtun communities from the north of the country who fought bitterly against the Taliban takeover of the country in the 1990s .
Saleh himself was an aide to Ahmed Shah Massoud , the leader of the Northern Alliance who was assassinated days before 9/11 on the orders of Bin Laden .
Although Saleh described the anti - Taliban movement as a non - tribal group covering the whole nation , at the rally on Thursday the audience appeared to be disproportionately made up of northerners , with a heavy representation of burly men from Panjshir , a valley north of Kabul that resisted the Taliban , who were assisting with security and crowd control .
Western diplomats have long warned that any political arrangement to bring the conflict to a close must not be , in the words of one , "" a Pashtun - to - Pashtun stitch - up "" .
But there is little sign that Karzai has succeeded in getting national buy - in for his peace plans .
Last year the Afghan president hosted a national "" peace jirga "" designed to win a national mandate for pursuing peace plans .
Unfortunately the event , which was boycotted by most of the leading non - Pashtun warlords and civil war leaders , was criticised by some for being unrepresentative ."
2011-06-06,"On his first day on the job as Her Majesty 's ambassador to Kabul in 2007 , Sherard Cowper - Coles told the mission 's top SIS ( MI6 ) officer that his priority would be to develop a good relationship with President Hamid Karzai .
The gruff northern spy quickly puts him right .
Oh no it wo n't .
Your key relationship will be with the American ambassador .
He matters most to us That dependent relationship is one of the central themes of Cowper - Coles memoir of his three years spent as ambassador and the UK special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
It is a dependence only skimpily veiled by the hubris and narcissism of Whitehall which is determined to be seen as driving events on the ground .
It was such personal and institutional vices that led to Britain 's ill - fated decision to deploy over three thousand troops in Helmand in 2006 .
Not long after that , Zamir Kabulov - the long - serving Russian ambassador who had been in Afghanistan on and off since 1977 - confided in his new British counterpart ( in Cowper - Coles ' phonetic spelling ) : I have a very varm feeling toward you Sherard .
You are making all ze same mistakes as ve did .
On his departure for Kabul for the first time , Cowper - Coles was handed a stack of policy documents with grandiose titles like "" UK strategy for Afghanistan "" , obscuring the fact that strategy was made in Washington and the Tampa headquarters of US Central Command .
As the years passed and Helmand descended deeper and deeper into conflict , British mandarins would routinely visit the front and return with confident reports of progress made "" while challenges remain "" .
Cowper - Coles confesses : Such was the pressure not to sound defeatist that all of us indulged from time to time in such self - congratulatory vacuities In private , however , Cowper - Coles quickly became a trenchant critic of the Britain 's army - driven military - first engagement in Afghanistan , and the most brutally honest diplomat in Kabul .
A half - hour conversation with him was generally a sobering corrective to the usual ' happy talk ' disseminated at Nato briefings .
That ' happy talk ' was not necessarily intended to deceive , Cowper - Coles argues .
Military intelligence is produced by serving officers who are , he says : part of a machine which understandably places a premium , especially in war , on optimism , loyalty and , to some extent , group think Embedded journalists also find themselves enmeshed in a web of obligations ( conscious or otherwise ) to the brave soldiers who have kept them safe on the battlefield .
The memoir is based on memory and "" four daily line of scribble in a rough and ready diary "" .
Cowper - Coles was not given access to the official record .
There make be a little too much here on the endless round of parties and morale - boosting fun and games at the Kabul embassy , but the book more than makes up with some telling anecdotes .
My favourite is the account of a huddle with President Karzai over the fate of a small heavily - contested slice of Helmand around Musa Qala .
We called for a map .
But it turned out that the president 's staff had no map of their country available .
I therefore pulled out an RAF map of the country , which I always carried in my briefcase .
The map was meant for aircrew to help them escape and survive if they were forced down in hostile territory .
It was printed on something like silk , so that it could be folded tight and concealed .
It bore a legend , in six central Asian languages and English , indicating that the bearer came in peace , help in returning him to friendly forces would be handsomely rewarded .
We stood round , peering at the map , trying without success to find the hamlet , Shah Kariz , in which Mullah Salam had his compound .
This was how the supreme command of the war operated .
Cowper - Coles and his boss , David Miliband , began to champion a change of course towards the pursuit of talks with the Taliban , first privately and then publicly in a speech at MIT in March 2010 .
That policy has since been adopted by the Obama administration .
For some months , Marc Grossman , the US special envoy has been looking for an authentic Taliban representative to talk to , and may or may not have found one in the form of a former aide to Mullah Omar , Mohammad Tayyab Agha .
It is still far from clear whether this road will lead anywhere , but there seems little doubt it is worth a try .
It also seems clear that a deal would have been easier several bloody years ago .
The Cowper - Coles memoir is a chronicle of at least some of that wasted time ."
2011-06-17,"The Afghan government will struggle to pay its bills "" within a month "" after the International Monetary Fund rejected proposals for resolving the Kabul Bank scandal , western officials have warned .
Although the war - torn country 's biggest bank nearly collapsed last September , the government of Hamid Karzai and the international community are still at loggerheads over plans to fund an $ 820 m ( £ 507 m ) bailout as well as how the disgraced former managers and shareholders who helped themselves to hundreds of millions of dollars should be prosecuted .
As long as the IMF declares the plans to be inadequate , many countries , including Britain , are legally barred from pumping money into a government that is almost completely reliant on foreign cash to pay civil servants ' salaries .
It was reported by Reuters that the IMF has now formally rejected the Afghan government 's proposals , meaning aid disbursements will remain on hold .
The failure to reach a deal by a deadline of last Saturday also meant a $ 70 m payment from the World Bank 's Afghan reconstruction trust fund was automatically withheld .
Two senior western officials said the government will face a cash crisis in the coming weeks and could struggle to pay staff bills , although one predicted this would be avoided by cutting other spending priorities .
Last month , Omar Zakhilwal , the country 's finance minister , told the Guardian that suspension of aid payments "" has already had an effect on us , no doubt about it "" .
He insisted that the Afghan government had done "" 95 % of what was asked of us "" by the IMF , including effectively nationalising Kabul Bank , stripping the shareholders of their rights and putting all unrecovered loans into receivership .
But although he claimed the remaining issues "" were inconsequential to Kabul Bank "" the IMF sees two aspects as vitally important .
Firstly , an agreement that Afghan taxes , not foreign aid , will repay the $ 820 m taken out of central bank reserves last year to prop up the bank .
Second , they want serious criminal investigations against managers and shareholders , many of whom enjoy high level political support , who illegally borrowed huge sums of interest - free cash from the bank .
Although the finance ministry has drawn up plans to increase its tax - raising efforts in order to pay off the bailout in annual instalments , horrified MPs have already rejected one budget request for $ 73 m and is also likely to reject a supplemental budget due to be presented by Zakhilwal soon . ""
The IMF tells me , this is our demand , give me condition by this date the parliament must approve this line in the budget , "" explained Zakhilwal .
"" I am a minister , can I chose the parliament timeline ?
On these issues the international community totally disregards the legal processes of Afghanistan .
"" Many MPs argue that the money should be found by simply selling off the assets illegally bought by shareholders and managers , including a gas distribution company , an airline and luxury villas in Dubai .
Although a $ 10 m forensic audit by Kroll may help identify many deliberately hidden assets , most western experts doubt more than half of the outstanding $ 910 m will be recovered .
So far just $ 61 m has been retrieved .
Zakhilwal also argued that prosecutions could only be handled by the attorney general and warned that the complicated inquiry can not be rushed .
"" The attorney general can arrest people , but after 15 days with not case they have to be acquitted – that would be even more embarrassing for us , "" Zakhilwal said .
Although the finance minister insisted the attorney general was "" absolutely committed "" to a thorough investigation , the international community is sceptical , not least after Afghanistan 's top law officer threw out a case last year against one of Karzai 's key aides who had been wire - tapped soliciting a bribe .
One alternative plan is for a special court of handpicked judges deemed to be reasonably honest and well - versed in finance to hear the case .
Credible prosecutions are vital , not just to appease public anger , but also because many of Kabul Bank 's assets are in Dubai .
Under United Arab Emirates law it is impossible to seize properties until criminal investigations have begun .
Not only does Afghanistan face a cash crunch , the showdown with the IMF also threatens to derail plans , pushed hard by Hamid Karzai , for a far greater proportion of international aid to be spent through official channels , rather than on projects outside the control of the government .
A key element of the "" transition "" strategy by which the foreign intervention in Afghanistan will be greatly reduced by the end of 2014 , the international community last year agreed that 50 % of spending will go through the government by 2012 .
But it is now feared that if the Afghan government continues to be considered unworthy of international investment by the IMF the country will have to return to patchwork of bilateral funding agreements ."
2011-06-20,"The ground is being readied at last for talks between the US and the Taliban .
Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , and Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , have just confirmed that preliminary contacts are under way .
Equally important , the UN security council 's sanctions list has been divided so as to separate Taliban leaders from those of al - Qaida , making it easier politically to remove restraints on the freedom of Taliban leaders to travel safely to meet negotiators .
There is a long way to go before full - scale talks begin , not least in creating a consensus in Washington behind their necessity .
In a television interview on Sunday , Gates declared : "" We have said all along that a political outcome is the way most wars end .
The question is when and if they [ the Taliban ] are ready to talk seriously . ""
His other comments made it clear the same question applies to the Americans .
Gates argued that further US military pressure was needed on the Taliban . ""
Talks yes , but not yet "" has long been the Pentagon position , articulated repeatedly by General David Petraeus , the US commander in Afghanistan , who will have even more access to President Obama in his next post as CIA chief .
Heated debate is going on in Washington over how many troops Obama will announce he is to start bringing out next month , and how soon the departing contingent will leave .
Whatever number is chosen will be a fudge , designed to satisfy the majority of Americans who have lost faith in the Afghan war , as well as the military hawks .
The Republicans are in an encouraging state of confusion with the first signs emerging that on Afghanistan , next year 's presidential candidate might attack Obama "" from the left "" by arguing for a faster US pullout .
But Obama 's announcement on a limited withdrawal will mean little unless accompanied by a clear statement that he intends to negotiate an end to the conflict , just as Lyndon Johnson eventually promised during the Vietnam war , though it took the Republican Richard Nixon to carry the talks through .
American decision - makers have still not grasped that the Taliban 's main motivation – as revealed in several surveys of insurgents – is a desire to end foreign occupation of their country .
US officials , political as well as military , produce endless briefings that claim people join the Taliban because of money , unemployment , or local disputes over land and family honour .
When Karzai himself warned the Americans this weekend that "" history shows what Afghans do with trespassers and occupiers "" and made the blindingly obvious point that the Americans are in Afghanistan primarily for their own purposes , US commentators referred to him as "" ranting "" , "" erratic "" , and "" perhaps struggling with a mental illness "" .
Karl Eikenberry , the US ambassador in Kabul , said he felt hurt by Karzai 's statements because "" America has never sought to occupy any nation in the world .
We are a good people . ""
Karzai is in a difficult position .
Like the Taliban , he wants to end his country 's occupation though he is not sure how to do it , given the countervailing pressures from the insurgency and the Americans , as well as from the anti - negotiation Tajik warlords who surround him and his Pashtun cronies , who have done well economically from the money the Americans have thrown at the country .
The main thing he must do now is postpone the talks on long - term US bases that the US is trying to push through under the guise of a "" strategic partnership agreement "" .
Support for a long - term US military presence in Afghanistan flies in the face of serious negotiations to end the war .
It will also undermine the prospects for any regional agreement between Afghanistan and its neighbours .
Russia , China and the four central Asian states who make up the influential Shanghai Co - operation Organisation came out at a summit meeting last week for a "" neutral "" Afghanistan .
That is also the position of India and Iran .
No peace deal in Afghanistan will stick unless the era of outside interference by its neighbours comes to an end , so the concept of "" neutrality "" must be upheld .
Having US forces in Afghanistan "" to protect Afghan neutrality "" is dangerous nonsense .
Besides ending foreign occupation , the biggest challenge is to end Afghanistan 's 35 years of civil war .
Only talks among all the Afghan stakeholders and parties , including the Taliban , can do that .
The Americans can not control the outcome but they should not impede it either .
That is why Obama 's declaration of support for a ceasefire and negotiations on a full withdrawal of US and other foreign troops would be his best contribution to getting the comprehensive settlement that Afghans desperately want ."
2011-06-23,
2011-06-23,"Afghanistan 's security forces are growing in stature and can be entrusted with securing the country 's future after the withdrawal of US troops , according to president Hamid Karzai .
Responding to Barack Obama 's announcement that a third of US troops in Afghanistan would be withdrawn by September next year , Karzai said the US president had made the right decision and thanked the international troops for their support . ""
The Afghan people 's trust in the Afghan army and police is growing every day and preservation of this land is the job of Afghans , "" Karzai told a news conference .
"" I welcome the decision of the US president today on pulling out [ some of ] ... its troops from Afghanistan and I consider this a right decision for the interest of both countries . ""
But the Afghan Taliban said the plan to withdraw 10,000 US troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year was only symbolic and that more serious steps would be needed "" to stop this pointless bloodshed "" .
"" Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan once again wants to make it clear that the solution for the Afghan crisis lies in the full withdrawal of all foreign troops immediately and [ while ] this does not happen , our armed struggle will increase from day to day , "" the Taliban said in an emailed statement .
The Nato secretary general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , said "" the tide is turning "" in Afghanistan , with the Taliban under increasing pressure and government security forces getting stronger .
In this context , he said , the drawdown of troops was the "" natural result "" .
Rasmussen said Obama 's decision was taken in close consultation with the allies and said the handover to Afghan security was still on track to be completed in 2014 .
France followed Obama 's televised announcement by issuing its own statement on the future of the 4,000 French troops in Afghanistan .
The office of the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , said there would be a progressive withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan , who would follow a timetable comparable to that of the staggered pullout of American troops , starting this summer .
Sarkozy was one of five leaders Obama called before his speech to inform them of his decision .
The French statement said : "" Given the progress we have seen [ in Afghanistan ] , France will begin a gradual withdrawal of reinforcement troops sent to Afghanistan , in a proportional manner and in a calendar comparable to the withdrawal of American reinforcements . ""
French troops have been involved in the US and Nato - led Afghanistan operation since 2001 , with 62 soldiers killed , and there has been growing frustration within political circles in the country over the long campaign .
The German foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle , welcomed Obama 's announcement and expressed his hope Germany 's contingent of 4,900 troops would be reduced before the end of the year .
Germany has yet to settle on details of its own pullback but Westerwelle said "" the prospect of withdrawal is now becoming concrete "" .
He described the US president 's speech as a "" clear commitment "" to the internationally agreed strategy of gradually handing over responsibility for security to Afghan forces and said : "" It is also our aim to be able to reduce our own German troop contingent for the first time at the end of this year . """
2011-07-05,"David Cameron has dismissed critics within his own party opposed to his pledge to increase spending on aid at a time of severe cuts in public expenditure .
Cameron made the comments in Kabul , at a news conference with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
He sought to underline that Britain 's reduction in frontline troops by 2014 did not mean the end of support for Afghanistan .
Asked whether an increase in aid to Afghanistan would now be needed to compensate for the withdrawal of troops , Cameron said : "" To people who are hard - headed about aid and possibly even hard - hearted about aid , I would say the programme we have in Afghanistan , trying to help the people and government of Afghanistan , to have a stronger , more secure , more stable country is not just good to people in Afghanistan , it 's good for people back home in Britain . ""
Cameron has pledged that the coalition will meet the UN target of 0.7 % of GDP being allocated to international aid by 2013 .
It currently stands at 0.52 % of GDP .
The pledge to increase spending on international aid at the same time as making cuts to other departments dates back to Cameron 's early attempts to modernise the party , but he been buffeted by increasingly confident voices in the last few months .
A leaked letter from his defence secretary , Liam Fox , recently said there were dangers in such an inflexible target , suggesting it might limit the room for manoeuvre of ministers in foreign affairs .
The Department for International Development said £ 102 m was spent on aid in the last financial year and it would rise this year to £ 178 m .
Of these totals , 16 % goes to Helmand province , where British troops operate .
In Afghanistan 's capital , Cameron said : "" Our aid programme in Afghanistan is one of our largest aid programmes anywhere in the world . ""
In the debate that we inevitably have in Britain about whether it 's right to be spending money on aid , I would say this is a great example of a country that , if we walk away from and if we ignore and forget about , the problems come visited back on our doorstep . ""
How do we know this ?
Because we 've done it before .
We walked away from Afghanistan in the past .
The problem of drugs got worse .
The problem of terrorism got worse .
The problem of extremism got worse .
The problem of asylum and immigration got worse . ""
He said his two aid priorities were to save lives and put money into previously broken states .
Karzai said : "" I would like to thank Britain for the assistance already delivered to the Afghan people in both treasure and blood of the British people and the taxpayers ' money . ""
Of course .
Afghanistan would find it desirable if Britain could continue to help Afghanistan , continuing to build its infrastructure and delivery of services to the Afghan people . """

2011-07-12,"Ahmed Wali Karzai , the powerful half - brother of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has been killed by one of his security guards inside his own house in Kandahar , according to the local chief of border police . ""
Ahmed Wali Karzai was killed at about 11.30am .
He was killed by his bodyguard inside his house , "" said General Abdul Razaq .
Razaq said an investigation into the assassination was under way .
A tribal elder in Kandahar province also confirmed the death of Ahmed Wali Karzai .
Karzai was seen as a keystone of security in the south and his assassination will raise fears about a potential power and security vacuum in the insurgent - ridden region .
Haji Padsha , an elder of the Alikozai tribe , said Ahmed Wali Karzai had been shot on his return from a meeting with foreigners at the former house of Mullah Mohammed Omar , the fugitive leader of the Afghan Taliban .
Karzai had come under criticism in the past from local Afghans for renting the property to international officials .
It was reported in the New York Times in 2009 that he received rent from the CIA and American special operations forces for allowing them to occupy a large compound outside the city that is the former home of Mullah Mohammed Omar .
The Kandahar Strike Force , an militia run by the CIA , also shares the compound .
Ahmed Wali Karzai was a powerful figure in Afghan politics .
He was said to be a key figure in the illegal Afghan opium trade and was also reported to be on the payroll of the CIA , both allegations he denied .
He said international forces used these charges to deflect their own failings in Afghanistan .
Ahmed Wali Karzai was the head of the provincial council in Kandahar , Afghanistan 's second biggest city , and had been the target of previous assassination attempts .
In 2009 four suicide bombers stormed the provincial council office in Kandahar , killing 13 people .
Ahmed Wali Karzai claimed he was the target of the attack .
The government media and information centre in Kandahar sent out a message via Twitter confirming the death of Ahmed Wali Karzai ."
2011-07-12,"Ahmed Wali Karzai , the powerful half - brother of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has been killed by one of his security guards inside his house in Kandahar , raising the prospect of turmoil in a city widely seen as the key to the war in Afghanistan .
The president confirmed the death at a press conference in Kabul intended to mark the visit of the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , to the capital . ""
Ahmed Wali Karzai was killed at about 11.30am , "" General Abdul Razaq , Kandahar 's chief of border police , said .
"" He was killed by his bodyguard inside his house . ""
Officials said the assassin , named as Sardar Mohammed , reportedly Ahmed Wali Karzai 's chief of security , had been killed on the spot . ""
After Sardar Mohammed killed Ahmed Wali Karzai , other bodyguards shot Sardar Mohammed , ""
Colonel Mohammad Mohsen , of the Afghan national army 205 Atal ( Hero ) Corps in Kandahar , said .
"" The bodies have been taken to the [ local ] hospital .
We expect some officials including President Karzai to come to Kandahar for his brother 's funeral . ""
Razaq said an investigation into the assassination was under way , but according to initial reports from Kandahar , Sardar entered his boss 's home and approached him with papers to sign , shooting him at close range with a pistol concealed under the papers .
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assassination , saying it was one of their "" biggest and most successful "" operations .
However , western officials said it was possible that he could have been killed as part of a settling of scores among tribal leaders or drug traffickers .
Ahmed Wali Karzai had frequently been accused by western officials of being a regional kingpin and warlord in the opium trade .
He also faced allegations of being on the CIA 's payroll .
He rejected all the charges , claiming they were made by western forces to cover their own shortcomings .
Ahmed Wali Karzai was a powerful figure in Afghan politics .
He had been a member of the provincial council in Kandahar since 2005 and was its chief at the time of his death , although his family , tribal and business contacts gave him influence far beyond his official title . ""
He was the president of Kandahar , "" said provincial elder Abdul Samat Zarih .
"" The governor , police chiefs and other officials all had to discuss things with him before they made a decision . ""
Zarih added that Ahmed Wali Karzai had many enemies , including the Taliban . ""
Maybe the Taliban killed him because he was close to the government .
Maybe he did n't obey or follow whatever the foreigners said to him .
It 's a situation in which you ca n't figure out what is going on , "" he said .
Ahmed Wali Karzai was also seen as a keystone of security in the south and his assassination will raise fears about a potential power and security vacuum in the insurgent - ridden region .
President Karzai also valued him as a trusted liaison between the government in Kabul and the nation 's second - biggest city .
"" People are asking what tomorrow will bring , "" said a senior US official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
"" Who is capable of replacing Ahmed Wali on the provincial council ?
As an intermediary between Kabul and Kandahar ?
Who is going to try and keep at bay the different rivalries bandaged over for the last few years ?
Who will fill the various holes occupied by AWK ?
These are all important questions . ""
He added his death was "" first and foremost a setback for Afghanistan as a whole "" .
Other western officials predicted that although there would be "" turbulence "" in the short term , while a new power structure took shape in Kandahar , in the longer term the absence of Ahmed Wali Karzai as a power broker could provide an opportunity to strengthen legitimate local government .
Ahmed Wali Karzai had been the target of previous assassination attempts .
In 2009 four suicide bombers stormed the provincial council office in Kandahar , killing 13 people .
Departing US commander General David Petraeus said the International Security Assistance Force had halted the Taliban 's momentum in key areas .
However , the Taliban strategy of targeted assassinations in Kandahar province demonstrates its continued ability to strike Isaf and the Afghan government where it hurts .
The Kandahar deputy governor , Abdul Latif Ashna , and provincial police chief , General Mohammad Mojayed , were killed in suicide attacks this year .
The Taliban claimed responsibility for both deaths .
The Isaf spokesman , Carsten Jacobson , agreed it was not yet certain the Taliban had carried out the attack .
He denied the assassination was a setback for Isaf .
"" We must find out how he was killed , "" Wahid Mujda , a former member of the Taliban turned analyst , said .
"" We do n't know whether it was carried out by a power rival or by the Taliban . ""
Mujda added the death would have an impact on the government and the progress being made in reconciliation talks with the Taliban .
Karzai supported the peace process and had chalked up a few reintegration successes in the province .
Haji Padsha , an elder of the Alikozai tribe in Kandahar province , said Karzai had been shot on his return from a meeting with foreigners at the former house of Mullah Mohammed Omar , the fugitive leader of the Afghan Taliban .
Karzai had come under criticism in the past from Afghans for renting the property to international officials .

2011-07-13,"With helicopters flying overhead and tight security on the ground , the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , led thousands of mourners in a funeral procession to bury his half - brother in the family 's ancestral village of Karz .
Karzai pushed through his bodyguards to climb down to the freshly dug grave of Ahmed Wali Karzai , saying a final farewell before throwing stones on the casket , following Islamic custom .
The president later appealed to fellow Afghans to stop the violence.""Once again I call on the Taliban , my dears , my brothers and friends , come and join me in building the country .
Stop destroying the country , "" he said .
Karzai , dubbed the president of Kandahar , was killed on Tuesday at his home by his trusted security chief , Sardar Mohammad .
Rumours circulated that Mohammad 's remains had been strung up at a city centre roundabout after he was shot dead by another bodyguard .
Mohammad 's motives for killing his boss are not clear and a personal clash has not been ruled out , although the Taliban has claimed responsibility for the assassination .
Immediately after the funeral , President Karzai placed a turban on the head of Shah Wali Khan , another of his half - brothers , but he made no official announcement as to who would become the new provincial council head .
The funeral procession set off from the Mandigak Palace , the governor of Kandahar 's residence , to a burial plot in Dand district at 7 am local time on Wednesday .
Karzai was joined at the funeral by Kandahar 's governor , Tooryalai Wesa , and the mayor of Kabul , Muhammad Yunus Nawandish .
Helmand 's governor , Gulab Mangal , was caught in a roadside bomb attack in Kandahar 's Maiwand district as he travelled to the funeral .
Two of his guards were injured , although he was unhurt .
Mourners said that Ahmed Wali Karzai would be a great loss , in Kandahar but also in the provinces of Helmand , Uruzgan and Zabul where he was a respected tribal elder .
Khalid Ahmad , a youth association leader , 30 , travelled from neighbouring Zabul for the funeral .
"" I have sat down with Ahmed Wali Karzai and had tea with him whenever I had problems and he was always very helpful , "" he said .
"" He had a good relationship with people , with young people , and he tried to help everybody .
I hope that his elder brother , Shah Wali Khan , works the same way with us . ""
Haji Nik Mohammad from Helmand was also there to pay his respects .
He said Ahmad Wali Karzai would be sorely missed as a facilitator among all tribes .
"" When people had problems that the governor or the police chief could not solve they came to Ahmed Wali Karzai , "" he said .
"" No one can replace him .
He was good to all tribes . ""
While it is true that many credited Ahmed Wali Karzai with keeping the lid on tribal tensions in the province , his detractors suggested that he was the cause of more problems than he solved .
His system of patronage politics alienated members of other tribes , making them more sympathetic to the Taliban .
At a press conference after the killing , President Karzai said : "" This is the life of the people of Afghanistan .
Afghan families , every one of us , have suffered from it and we hope , God willing , for our suffering to be over . ""
The brothers ' father , Abdul Ahad Karzai , was assassinated in 1999 .
Ahmed Wali Karzai 's body was released to the family on Tuesday afternoon from the Mirwais hospital , in Kandahar .
Islamic custom stipulates that a body must be buried within 24 hours , but a memorial is scheduled for Thursday to allow more members of the family time to travel to Kandahar .
Kandahar 's police chief , General Abdul Razaq , said an investigation had been launched into the assassination .
Local media reported claims from officials that a number of arrests had been made on Tuesday night , but a spokesman for the interior ministry declined to confirm that .
The Taliban adopted a strategy of targeted assassinations in Kandahar after its members had their freedom of movement within the province curtailed by the influx of soldiers of the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) during the 2010 surge .
More than half of all assassinations in Afghanistan since March occurred in Kandahar , according to a recent UN report ."
2011-07-13,"I was being ushered out of the office of a senior Nato officer in Kandahar when he turned to me and said : "" If I was a young man , I 'd be fighting with the Taliban . ""
As they prepared their Kandahar offensive last summer , a British - led command group came to the conclusion the real trouble in Kandahar was not the Taliban but what became known as "" malign actors "" .
The actor in chief was the man universally referred to as AWK – Ahmed Wali Karzai , the brother of President Hamid Karzai , who was killed yesterday .
I ca n't name the officer who spoke to me .
But Nick Carter , a British major general then in charge , was equally blunt about where the trouble lay .
Deploying a complicated chart of Pashtun tribes , he explained how the origin of the Taliban could be linked to the dominant power held across southern Afghanistan , both in the 1990s and after 9/11 , by a small sway of "" king - making "" tribes , including the Popalzai of Karzai 's family and the larger Alikozai and Barakzai groups .
Thus the formation of the Taliban was , in great measure , a revolt of the excluded .
When they arrived after 9/11 in Afghanistan , the US chose to ally with warlords from these tribes to push out the Taliban .
And , in the years that followed , rather than break those ties and widen the circle of power , Nato got to be ever more dependent on these men .
As the journalist Anand Gopal has explained brilliantly , powerbrokers such as AWK and the Barakzai strongman and former Kandahar governor Gul Agha Sherzai not only seized control of Nato purse - strings by acquiring lucrative contracts , but they also manipulated US intelligence and US special forces to gain help with their predatory and retaliatory agenda .
Facing the risk of constant arrest and harassment , they drove the former Taliban over the border into Pakistan , where the movement began to be reconstituted .
On the streets of Kandahar , where I stayed unembedded last year , I reported on how it was obvious the armed militias of AWK and other strongmen like Sherzai who ruled the roost were feared far more than the Taliban .
Perched on a strategic trans - Asia highway , Kandahar is essentially a giant truck stop .
The smuggler was and is king .
Most of the media – then obsessed by calling the city a "" Taliban stronghold "" – failed to grasp it .
I remember getting an email from a senior US officer after the district governor of Arghandab , just outside the city , was gunned down , in a killing blamed widely on the Taliban . ""
Do n't be fooled , "" he told me .
This was not the Taliban 's work .
"" It 's more like a mafia hit , "" he said .
In the face of such analysis , Carter and his then commander , General Stan McChrystal , decided to face down AWK .
A US intelligence chief paid him a visit – threatening that if he put a step wrong they would put him on the target list .
There was a discussion about whether he could be forced into exile . ""
If we are going to conduct a population - centric strategy in Afghanistan , and we are perceived as backing thugs , then we are just undermining ourselves ,
"" Major General Michael T Flynn , then the senior US military intelligence official in Afghanistan , was quoted as saying .
But ultimately the US and Nato backed down .
They worried about the power vacuum AWK would leave behind .
They knew how dependent they were on him : it was AWK and Sherzai who staffed and guarded the Nato bases , who secured their vital road movements , provided intelligence and who supplied the manpower for some secret strike forces run by the CIA and US special forces . ""
Every place has a king and you know better than me who is king of Kandahar , "" a local human rights activist , Shahid Hussein , told me .
"" It is Ahmed Wali Karzai , and he is not doing it just because he is the brother of the president ; he is doing it because he is backed by the Americans . ""
But , as senior generals told me , the real trouble was politics .
It was all really a "" matter of Kabul "" .
The problem of "" malign actors "" such as AWK could only be solved not by military force , but by a political process : President Karzai had to find a means to divorce himself from the warlords such as his brother and broaden the base of his political rule .
It was a fanciful dream .
What Nato lacked , and lacks now acutely , was the luxury of time .
McChrystal and his successor , General David Petraeus , won their surge of military force in Afghanistan – but it was extracted from Washington at the price of a drastic timetable , driven by a political and popular demand for a quick exit .
And so , just as the US hurried to defeat the Taliban in 2001 and needed the warlords to accomplish that task , as they prepare to leave , they risk depending on men such as AWK to secure their withdrawal .
They fear there really is n't time to reshape Afghan politics .
A case in point is an ally of AWK and notorious gangster in his own right , the border police chief Abdul Razaq .
Far from ending ties with him , Razaq and his militia were brought in by Nato to play a crucial role in the military offensives last year ; and when the police chief of Kandahar was slain this year , Razaq was brought in to fill his shoes .
In this triumph of realpolitik , the death of AWK is a big setback .
With the fundamental dynamics unchanged , a new strongman will finally emerge as boss .
But in the meantime there will be some chaos .
The warlords will squabble in a bloody fashion among themselves and – like in The Godfather – will "" go to the mattresses "" .
Hamid Karzai is also personally wounded .
He rules through powerbrokers and – without his anchor down south – will likely be more rudderless than usual .
And yet in his death there is some hope .
AWK ruled by fear .
Cowed by his militias , we found not a single local journalist , for instance , who dared criticise him last year .
If there is a chance to change those dynamics , to remake the politics , to break the power of the warlords , then this is it .
But do n't hold your breath ."

2011-07-15,"The death of Ahmed Wali Karzai , who was killed by a close associate this week , epitomised the chaos , uncertainty and betrayal that have characterised much of the post-2001 western intervention in Afghanistan .
The course of his life , both as a refugee after the invasion of his homeland by Soviet forces in 1979 and after returning at the fall of the Taliban regime , reflected the troubles afflicting Afghanistan in recent decades .
The half - brother of the president , Hamid Karzai , Ahmed Wali was shot three times in his residence - cum - office in the southern city of Kandahar by a trusted commander , who had worked for his victim for many years as a bodyguard .
Ahmed Wali Karzai was born in the small southern Afghan town of Karz , son of a senior leader of the Popalzai tribe and well - known politician who was later killed in exile by the Taliban .
He had six brothers and a sister .
Little is known about his childhood , but the 1960s and early 1970s are now seen as a golden time of relative stability in the country .
In his late teens , however , Karzai was forced to leave Afghanistan .
His father opposed the Marxist regime in power in Kabul since 1978 , and fierce fighting had broken out , pitting rebels against government and then Soviet forces , which arrived in 1979 in the part of the country where the family lived .
These southern and eastern provinces were to suffer massive damage during the subsequent decade - long Soviet occupation and the civil war that followed .
Karzai found his way to the US and worked in an Afghan restaurant in Chicago .
He travelled to Pakistan regularly and was in Quetta , the southern Pakistani city , when his brother , Hamid , headed into Afghanistan as the Taliban regime crumbled .
Highly practical , he provided crucial logistical support for his brother 's risky , but eventually successful , bid to rally local tribes against the hardline Islamic militia .
Following the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , Hamid Karzai consolidated his and his family 's power in Kabul , and Ahmed Wali Karzai rose rapidly to become a major power broker in the family 's native south - east .
His election to the Kandahar provincial council in 2005 was the formal recognition of already extensive informal influence .
However , the sometimes charming and occasionally forceful Karzai was already attracting controversy .
Secret American intelligence briefings from 2006 alleged that he was in league with the narcotics barons who had exploited the poor security and governance of the south to boost production massively .
Detailed charges appearing in the American press , often as a result of leaks from frustrated officials , led to repeated calls for his dismissal and removal from Kandahar , with one American ambassador suggesting that he be sent overseas as an ambassador .
All accusations were denied , no direct evidence ever appeared , and protection came from two powerful sources : his own brother in Kabul and the American secret services , which saw Karzai as a useful asset .
The CIA is believed to have used him to raise a secret force to hunt insurgents and other targets and to gather intelligence .
Karzai 's many tribal connections and influence were seen as useful in stabilising the south and , when it became of interest , in communicating with the insurgents themselves .
He managed to retain his position in Kandahar – even after apparently playing a key role in the intimidation and fraud that marred the presidential election of 2009 , and as new American commanders introduced fresh strategies .
In their efforts during the past 18 months to regain full control of the south of the country , senior international officers in Afghanistan decided that it was better to co - opt Karzai rather than confront a man whose capacity to cause them trouble was evident .
Karzai had survived another turn of Afghan politics and war .
His skill , wile and connections were insufficient , however , to allow him to survive indefinitely .
He is survived by a wife and , it is thought , four children . •
Ahmed Wali Karzai , born 1961 ; died 12 July 2011"

2011-07-18,"The assassination of a close ally and mentor of Hamid Karzai a week after the killing of the president 's powerful half - brother has raised new questions over whether Afghanistan 's precarious power structure could collapse even before the departure of western combat troops in 2014 .
Jan Muhammad Khan was killed when two gunmen stormed his walled compound in Kabul on Sunday night , holding off Afghan security forces until Monday morning .
The attackers also gunned down an MP from Khan 's home province , Uruzgan , before being killed themselves .
The assassinations of the two powerful warlords , who once seemed unassailable , have caused widespread shock .
Ahmed Shah Behsad , an MP from Herat , said : "" These killings show the weakness of failure of Karzai 's politics .
The situation is crisis .
Karzai has lost control of the country . ""
The Taliban said they carried out the killing , but that could not be confirmed .
It is also unclear whether they were behind the death last week of Ahmed Wali Karzai , the president 's half - brother , who was shot at close range by his own security chief at his home in Kandahar .
A week on , explanations ranged from a vendetta over money to the possibility that the security chief had been "" turned "" by the Taliban in Pakistan .
The two targets had much in common .
Ahmed Wali was the president 's closest sibling and the mainstay of his support in Kandahar .
Khan was described by some as a surrogate father to the Karzai brothers , and he held similar sway over Uruzgan .
Both men were warlords who had built their power on force and were reported to have amassed fortunes from the drug trade .
In the absence of more legitimate institutions , western forces had relied on them to help fight the Taliban .
Ahmed Wali ran a paramilitary group called the Kandahar Strike Force , which co - operated with Nato special forces and the CIA .
Khan , another member of the president 's Popolzai tribe , had left Uruzgan in 2006 on the insistence of Dutch troops unhappy with his drug - running , but his influence persisted .
His nephew , Matiullah , runs a private army in Uruzgan that helps fight the Taliban and protects Nato convoys for cash .
Khan was believed to have helped the US target suspected Taliban fighters – and his rivals .
Thomas Ruttig of the Kabul - based Afghan Analysts Network wrote on Monday : "" With his rivals , [ Jan Muhammad Khan ] dealt ruthlessly .
He labelled them Taliban , and sent the special forces after them – who misinterpreted their mandate to support the ' central government ' as supporting one man against his personal rivals and who appreciated his qualities as an effective Taliban hunter . ""
Two months ago a key Karzai ally in the north , police chief Muhammad Daoud Daoud , was killed in Takhar province by a Taliban suicide bomber who infiltrated a meeting between local officials and Nato officers .
The spate of high - profile assassinations has come amid a string of other killings of figures within the country 's informal power structure – a network of establishment figures , warlords and drug - runners .
Cumulatively , observers say , the killings have sapped Hamid Karzai 's political strength and undermined his ability to withstand a Taliban onslaught when western troops leave .
Gerard Russell , a former British diplomat to Afghanistan , said : "" The balance of power is being radically destabilised , and central government is losing any prospect of wielding authority .
The targets are really the linchpins of the post-2001 security settlement , and they are being pulled out one by one .
So it 's even more serious that it looks .
Afghanistan has been built on building blocks like these . ""
Khan 's killing coincided with departure of General David Petraeus , the architect of Nato 's military strategy in Afghanistan , to become CIA director in Washington , and came a few hours after a ceremony on Sunday to mark the start of transition from Nato to Afghan - run security in the first Afghan province , Bamiyan .
A similar handover will be marked this week in Lashkar Gah , the British - garrisoned administrative centre of Helmand province , where seven Afghan policemen were killed at a checkpoint on Monday .
The transition is due to be completed by the end of 2014 , when all western combat troops are due to have left .
However , several observers said that the spate of killings of Karzai relatives and lieutenants raised doubts that the president 's authority would hold up that long .
"" The biggest thing is the psychological impact on Karzai losing two people very close to him and to the family , "" Ruttig said .
"" In a system here that is very patronage - based , that he is not able to protect his closest allies will have consequences .
People will hedge their bets , in case the Taliban come back one day .
They will make deals so they can survive that .
With the first western soldiers leaving there is an atmosphere of concern and fear .
People sending their sons out of the country to study or giving money so smugglers can take them abroad …
they do n't trust that the institutions are sustainable enough to survive . ""

This article was amended on 19 July 2011 because the original said that Ahmed Shan Behsad 's area as an MP was Uruzgan ."
2011-07-28,"An apparent campaign to eliminate Hamid Karzai 's most important allies in southern Afghanistan has continued with an assault on the base of the powerful warlord Matiullah Khan .
At least 17 people were killed when half a dozen insurgents armed with machine guns and suicide bombs launched an assault on buildings in Tirin Kot , the capital of Uruzgan , a province adjoining both Kandahar and Helmand .
Khan was unharmed in the attacks , which targeted the compound of his militia – regarded as a semi - official force – the local police headquarters and the provincial governor 's house .
Khan told the Guardian that two members of his force were wounded and one policeman was killed .
He said a local journalist was killed when the office of the state broadcaster RTA was attacked .
The reporter , Omaid Khapalwak , worked for an Afghan wire service and the BBC .
"" We have very good security here so they were not able to enter my battalion 's camp , so they attacked the television station instead , "" Khan said .
He blamed the attack on Pakistan and Iran , saying they gave orders to the Taliban . ""
They want to kill all the elders and leading people in Afghanistan so that this country will become the slave of Pakistan , "" he said .
Mohammad Nabi , the head of the main hospital in Tirin Kot , said the attack began when a suicide car bomber drove into the front gate of the governor 's compound , damaging the nearby women 's hospital .
He said one child had been killed , in addition to more than 20 people injured .
The attack , for which the Taliban claimed responsibility while it was still under way , will be embarrassing for the government and Nato , given Tirin Kot 's size , importance and recent claims that security has improved there .
The attempt on Khan 's life follows the recent assassinations of three crucial pillars of Karzai 's power base in southern Afghanistan : Ahmed Wali Karzai , the Afghan president 's brother ; Jan Mohammad Khan , one of the leading figures in Uruzgan ; and Ghulam Haider Hamidi , the mayor of Kandahar .
Ahmed Wali , Jan Mohammad and Matiullah Khan have much in common .
All three had been condemned as troublemakers by Nato chiefs who said their monopolisation of the south 's booming war economy and the exclusion of other tribal groupings from power and wealth helped fuel anti - government resentment and Taliban recruitment .
They also all represent rival centres of power to official government institutions that have struggled to develop in the shadow of such powerful warlords .
Despite concerns over the impact of what Nato calls "" malign actors "" , it has been unable to dislodge them in part because they play a vital role in supporting military operations .
Matiullah Khan 's 2,000-man militia , for example , effectively controls the vital highway linking Kandahar to Tirin Kot .
Without him crucial supplies would not be able to reach the Dutch , Australian and US troops who have all operated in the province over recent years .
Securing convoys has earned him a fortune in fees of up to $ 1,700 ( £ 1,050 ) per truck , which he collects from logistics companies .
His militia also won him the respect and support of US special forces , who conduct joint operations with Matiullah 's men despite some reports that he has also co - operated with insurgents and drug traffickers .
From the same Popolzai tribe as the Karzai family , Matiullah formed a close operational alliance with Ahmed Wali and other strongmen in the south .
He is the nephew of Jan Mohammad Khan .
The loss of so many Karzai allies comes at a time when the president has become ever more isolated and unpopular .
He is also engaged in a bitter dispute with parliament over last year 's election results , prompting some MPs to call for him to be impeached ."
2011-08-06,"A US helicopter crash in eastern Afghanistan has killed 31 US special forces and seven Afghan soldiers .
The crash happened on Friday night when the helicopter was taking the soldiers back to their base after an operation .
The Taliban have claimed responsibility , saying their fighters downed the helicopter in a battle with Nato troops , according to the office of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
The Islamist group said eight of its fighters had been killed in the fighting .
The incident is believed to be the biggest single loss of life for US forces in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001 .
Nawaz Haqyar , a provincial police chief , said the helicopter had come down in Maidan Wardak province , west of the capital , Kabul .
Karzai said he has sent his condolences to Barack Obama ."
2011-08-10,"An attempt by Hamid Karzai to resolve the world 's longest running and most bitter election dispute has backfired after the Afghan president issued a decree of such ambiguity that both sides claimed victory .
Baffled lawyers pored over the text , which simultaneously supports and undermines a controversial special court backed by Karzai , but damned as unconstitutional by many , that has called for a quarter of MPs in the country 's parliament to be turfed out of office .
The stakes in the 11-month standoff between Karzai and the country 's parliament have become higher since the president said was unhappy with last September 's election result that diluted the strength of his fellow ethnic Pashtuns .
Various attempts have been made to overturn the results , including shambolic constituency recounts ridiculed by election watchdogs .
Those efforts have appalled foreign diplomats and sitting MPs , including an influential faction agitating for Karzai 's impeachment .
So a decree published by Karzai 's office on Wednesday looked at first blush like an extraordinary and abject climbdown by a mercurial president with a long record of defying the international community .
The Independent Electoral Commission 's top electoral official hailed the decree as a proof that , after months of wrangling , the president was backing his organisation as the final arbiter of the results .
William Patey , the British ambassador , said the decree "" provides the opportunity for the conclusion of the parliamentary crisis "" , adding he looked forward to the IEC "" completing their work as soon as possible "" .
Simultaneously , however , a group of former MPs who lost their seats claimed the decree , in effect , ordered the IEC to enforce the special court 's decision to replace 62 members .
That was because although the decree acknowledged the primacy of the IEC , it also said the "" findings of the special court and appeal court must be applied by the IEC "" .
An Afghan lawyer who regularly deciphers government decrees said "" the government is playing a trick "" designed to force the IEC 's hand .
The International Crisis Group interpreted the document as a "" muddled and fumbling approach to find a compromise "" , whereby Karzai would agree to just a handful of MPs being evicted .
But ICG analyst Candace Rondeaux warned that Karzai is so weakened politically that parliament might refuse to accept even that . ""
At this stage I just do n't think Karzai has enough money [ to bribe MPs ] or political influence to get parliament to accept it , "" she said .
But if he fails to make any changes , Karzai will further alienate disgruntled powerbrokers who want to reclaim seats they regard as "" theirs "" ."
2011-09-12,"US - backed Afghan militias are committing murder , rape , torture and extortion , risking increasing support for the insurgent groups they were designed to fight against , a prominent human rights group has said .
Militias including the Afghan Local Police ( ALP ) – seen as a key plank in Nato 's troop reduction plans – suffer from poor oversight and no accountability , and are prone to act with impunity , Human Rights Watch said .
The ALP programme was introduced by the former commander of foreign forces in Afghanistan , General David Petraeus , despite opposition from a sceptical President Hamid Karzai , who had it "" forced down his throat like a foie gras goose "" , a military official told the Guardian .
One of Petraeus 's predecessors , General Dan McNeill , had rebuffed British attempts to arm militias after warning in 2008 that "" there has been some good work here to get those things back in the box "" .
The year - old ALP scheme is the latest attempt by the Nato - led mission in Afghanistan to create local militias in areas where the country 's security forces are lacking .
According to Petraeus , it was "" arguably the most critical element in our effort to help Afghanistan develop the capability to secure itself "" .
It is supported by US special forces and overseen by the Afghan ministry of the interior , and is being expanded after initial success in some areas where the local militias beat back insurgents .
But Human Rights Watch 's 102-page report , Just Do n't Call it a Militia , details how the US - funded "" high - risk "" and "" quick - fix "" solution has been plagued by poor design , a lack of oversight and insufficient vetting of the 7,000 recruits , some of whom are criminals or insurgents .
The US has approved funding for a further 23,000 ALP recruits .
Human Rights Watch says the ALP has improved security in some areas , but it has uncovered multiple examples of human rights abuses that threaten to undermine its worth .
In one of the worst examples of brutality , ALP militiamen detained two teenage boys on suspicion of planting roadside bombs in the district of Shindand , in Herat province .
An elder told Human Rights Watch : "" Other elders and I went to the ALP base to collect [ one of the boys ] .
He had been beaten and nails had been hammered into his feet .
"" The most serious cases of abuse involve the killing and gang rape of child suspects , beatings , land grabs and the forcible collection of ushr , an informal tax .
None of the cases have resulted in any action against the perpetrators , often because of the ALP 's links to powerful figures , the report says .
"" Patronage links to senior officials in the local security forces and the central government allow supposedly pro - government militias to terrorise local communities and operate with impunity , "" said Brad Adams , Asia director at Human Rights Watch .
The report details the expansion of Afghan government - backed militias , which are known as arbakai , in the northern province of Kunduz in order to "" prevent a Taliban takeover "" .
The district governor of Khanabad , Nizamuddin Nashir , told Human Rights Watch the groups were operating lawlessly . ""
They collect [ taxes ] , take the daughters of the people , they do things against the wives of the people , they take their horses , sheep , anything , "" he said .
Human Rights Watch called for the disbandment of such irregular armed groups and for the US and Afghan governments to tighten vetting procedures and provide better oversight of the ALP .
It also wants to ensure that allegations of abuse are investigated in accordance with the Leahy law , which forbids US military assistance to any foreign security force involved in human rights abuses for which it is not held accountable . ""
While there is a need for more security at the village level , the Afghan and US governments should be very careful not to repeat the mistakes of militias past , "" Adams said .
"" If quick corrections are not made , the ALP could end up being just another militia that causes more problems than it cures . ""
A spokeswoman from the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force said the report "" potentially provides a way ahead in refining and improving areas "" where the programme was deficient .
Isaf would work with the Afghan government in investigating the allegations of abuse and mistreatment noted in the report , the spokeswoman added ."
2011-09-20,"Hopes of ending the war in Afghanistan through a negotiated settlement appeared in tatters on Tuesday after insurgents assassinated Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani , a former president of Afghanistan appointed by Hamid Karzai to begin peace talks with the Taliban .
At around 6 pm local time a bomb ripped through Rabbani 's house in the heart of Kabul 's diplomatic district , just a stone 's throw from the US embassy which was attacked by militants last week .
Sources close to Rabbani said the former president died in the explosion and Masoom Stanekzai , another key official in charge of Karzai 's reconciliation strategy , was seriously injured .
Such an apparently deliberate attack on a still - embryonic peace process that has created tensions within Afghanistan and between its neighbours is likely to tip the country further into political crisis .
Unconfirmed reports indicated that the two men were holding a meeting with a pair of insurgents to discuss peace plans .
That raises the possibility that one of the insurgents could have been the bomber .
Mohammad Aslam , a baker whose shop is just down the road from the house , said he thought the blast came from within the house as the sound of the explosion was "" extremely weak "" .
Rabbani , who was chairman of the High Peace Council which was set up by Karzai last year to develop a framework for peace , regularly held meetings with insurgents on either side of the Afghan - Pakistani border .
A Tajik and former warlord from northern Afghanistan who fought against the Taliban , he was a controversial choice .
Although many analysts argued that the Taliban would never take a man with his history seriously , his appointment was also designed to appease northern , non - Pashtun Afghans who were deeply suspicious of any peace deals .
Rabbani 's death is likely to embolden those opposition figures who are most strongly opposed to a peace talks with insurgents ."
2011-09-20,"Hopes for a peaceful end to the 10-year war in Afghanistan were in tatters after a suicide bomber with explosives concealed in his turban killed Hamid Karzai 's chief peace envoy .
The assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani by men posing as leading Taliban envoys looked certain to tip the country even deeper into crisis .
Rabbani was a former president of Afghanistan , respected religious scholar and chairman of the country 's high peace council .
The explosion in the heart of Kabul 's diplomatic district kills off a peace process that was already on life support .
It also deprives President Karzai of an important ally who had flown into Kabul specifically to meet the men claiming to be Taliban envoys and emboldens his enemies who are implacably opposed to the idea of powersharing with armed insurgents .
"" This absolutely shows that peace with the Taliban is dead , "" said Ahmed Wali Massoud , the brother of a famous anti - Taliban guerrilla leader who was killed by suicide bombers days before the terrorist attacks of September 11 .
"" It does n't work , it wo n't work , "" he added .
The high peace council , a body set up last year by Karzai , has been trying to get talks off the ground against an increasingly inauspicious background .
Insurgent groups have stepped up their attacks , not least launching spectacular assaults in the Afghan capital and assassinating key Karzai allies .
And a set of secret talks mediated by the German government with a senior Taliban official has already collapsed .
Last week Rabbani led a conference of provincial governors and officials in the southern city of Kandahar to develop policies for reintegrating insurgents who want to give up the fight .
Not surprisingly a meeting with two men claiming to be
senior Taliban officials was the first thing on Rabbani 's agenda after flying back to Kabul from a subsequent trip to Dubai .
According to an aide to Rabbani they said they represented the Quetta Shura , the Taliban 's governing body , and had an important message to deliver .
Not only were the visitors deemed too important to search thoroughly , inspecting a turban is still generally seen as disrespectful , even though there have been three other cases this year of the headgear used to conceal bombs .
The aide said that when Rabbani entered the room one of them approached him , hugging him tight and placing his head on his victim 's chest .
Shopkeepers nearby heard a muffled bang from inside the building , which was still loud enough to set off the "" duck and cover "" alarms at the US embassy a short distance away .
The former president was killed instantly while four others in the room were injured , including Masoom Stanekzai , a highly - regarded technocrat who runs the day - to - day operations of the peace council and had brought the men to Rabbani 's house .
The second man was also seriously injured .
His turban was burning when he was found , according to an official from the country 's interior ministry .
He was taken to hospital , where strenuous efforts were made to keep him alive in the hope he would help investigators with their enquiries .
On hearing the news Karzai scrapped plans to participate at the United Nations general assembly and announced that he would immediately return from New York to Kabul .
Rabbani 's killing is also looks set to exacerbate already acute ethnic tensions in the country .
A Tajik and former warlord from northern Afghanistan who fought against the Taliban
, Rabbani was a controversial choice as a point man on reconciliation issues .
But although many observers argued that the Taliban would never take a man with his background seriously , his appointment was also designed to appease northern , non - Pashtun Afghans who were deeply suspicious of any peace deals .
Haroun Mir , a political analyst with a background in northern mujahideen groups , said the death would "" increase the ethnic and geographic divide "" in Afghanistan .
"" There were voices in the north that were critical of the peace process , but because of Rabbani 's involvement , and because he was so respected , they kept quiet .
These more critical voices will not now remain quiet .
"" Abdullah Abdullah , the country 's leading opposition figure , said the death of Rabbani showed the insurgents were trying to wipe out the political figures who ruled the country before the emergence of the Taliban in the 1990s .
"" We should recognise and know our enemy from lower ranks up to the top officials of the country because by any means , by any way , they are trying to kill us and eliminate all high ranking officials and jihadi leaders . ""
Former intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh , a northerner who has warned in the past that the north might be forced to rearm if a Karzai cut a "" deal "" with the Taliban , once again warned of the risk of "" civil unrest "" .
"" The killing of Rabbani who had devoted his life to serving Afghanistan and to peace once again reminds us that reconciliation can not be possible from a position of weakness but strength only , "" he said .
"" It is time for us to unite for change and for defeat of the Taliban . """
2011-09-21,"The Taliban have refused to accept or deny responsibility for the assassination in Kabul of former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani , which has plunged the country into a deep political crisis .
On the first of three days of national mourning following the killing on Tuesday of Hamid Karzai 's chief peace negotiator , the Taliban 's spokesmen published a statement on their website refusing to discuss the incident and contesting an earlier report by the Reuters news agency that said the Taliban accepted responsibility .
"" Our position on this issue is that we ca n't talk about it and all the media reports that claim responsibility are groundless , "" it said .
"" Right now we do n't want to talk . ""
Their reticence to comment on the killing – by a man posing as a senior Taliban envoy with explosives hidden in his turban – is in stark contrast to the aftermath of other spectacular attacks in the capital : the Taliban 's PR department often feeds details to the media while their operations are still ongoing .
Diplomats say it raises the possibility that Mullah Omar and other high - ranking Taliban leaders may not have approved , or even have been aware of , an operation conducted by a splinter or affiliated group linked to Pakistan 's powerful military intelligence agency , the ISI , which has long - standing ties to militant groups .
A western expert on the Taliban , who did not want to be identified , said senior figures within the movement had tried to bypass the ISI and hold direct talks with Karzai 's government and the US , and Pakistan had responded with ruthless efforts to reassert control of any negotiations .
He said spectacular attacks in Kabul in recent months were probably designed to derail any independent Taliban contacts with the government , while the killing of Rabbani could have been aimed at putting all talks on hold for several months .
"" It is not that they want to close the door on one set of negotiations [ with Rabbani ] but on all kinds of negotiations , "" he said .
"" They would rather have no talks than some talks that they ca n't control . ""
Diplomats are bracing themselves for the possibility that blame will be pinned on the Haqqani network , a militant group that nominally follows Omar but is believed to be heavily influenced by the ISI .
If the recent rhetoric of US ambassadors in the region is anything to go by , it is already in a state of apoplectic anger over Pakistan 's role in supporting Haqqani , which has been blamed for several major attacks , including last week 's 20-hour assault on the US embassy in Kabul .
That fury would grow if Haqqani was implicated in the hugely destabilising killing of Rabbani .
"" There is no doubt that there is a very serious conspiracy by those opposed to peace talks , "" said Ahmed Rashid , an influential Pakistani commentator who strongly supports a political settlement in Afghanistan .
"" They are trying to sabotage them before they take off .
"" There was no love lost between Rabbani and the Taliban , a movement he fought against .
And the Taliban have a stated policy of trying to kill members of the high peace council , the body that Rabbani chaired .
But some analysts think killing him would be a step too far , even for the Taliban .
Wahid Mujda a political analyst who held a mid - level position within the old Taliban regime , said its Quetta Shura would be reluctant to claim credit for killing a figure who commanded respect among a large group of Afghans , not least among his fellow Tajiks ."
2011-10-01,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has ruled out further attempts to negotiate peace with the Taliban .
He said the killing of Burhanuddin Rabbani , the former Afghan president who was leading efforts to broker peace with the terrorist group , had convinced him to focus on dialogue with Pakistan instead .
Karzai , who for years pushed for reconciliation with the Taliban , said his position had changed after Rabbani was killed at his home on 20 September by a suicide bomber purporting to be a Taliban peace emissary .
Attempts to negotiate with the insurgent movement were futile , said the president in a videotaped speech released by his office on Saturday .
"" Their messengers are coming and killing …
So with whom should we make peace ? ""
Karzai said in the recorded address to the country 's senior religious leaders .
"" I can not find Mullah Mohammad Omar , "" Karzai said , referring to the Taliban 's one - eyed leader .
"" Where is he ?
I can not find the Taliban council .
Where is it ? ""
I do n't have any other answer except to say that the other side for this negotiation is Pakistan .
"" Most of the Taliban leadership is thought to be living in Pakistan , and its governing council known as the Quetta Shura is based in the southern Pakistani city of Quetta .
It has long been believed that the Pakistani government has sheltered and influenced the group .
The Afghan government said on Saturday it had evidence that Rabbani 's assassination was planned by Taliban figures living in Quetta ."
2011-10-03,"The commander of Afghanistan 's most notorious militant outfit , the Haqqani network , has denied playing a part in the assassination of President Hamid Karzai 's main peace envoy two weeks ago .
"" We have n't killed Burhanuddin Rabbani , "" Sirajuddin Haqqani said in an audiotape message delivered to the BBC Pashto service , referring to the peace envoy killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul on 20 September .
It was the first public pronouncement by the Haqqanis on an issue that has triggered a fresh war of words between Pakistan and Afghanistan and killed off near - term hopes of starting peace talks to end the conflict .
On Monday Islamabad lashed out at Afghan accusations that its Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) spy service engineered the assassination to control the barely - nascent Taliban peace process . ""
Instead of making such irresponsible statements , those in positions of authority in Kabul should seriously deliberate as to why all those Afghans who are favourably disposed towards peace and towards Pakistan are systematically being removed from the scene and killed , "" Pakistan 's foreign ministry said in a statement .
Afghan investigators allege that Rabbani 's assassin was a Pakistani whose mission had been controlled from the western Pakistani city of Quetta , where the Taliban "" Quetta shura "" is allegedly based .
If true , that would discount the role of the Haqqani network , which operates further east along the lawless border .
Nonetheless , the Haqqanis remain a major point of contention between Pakistan , Afghanistan and the US .
Two weeks ago the outgoing US military chief , Admiral Mike Mullen , caused consternation with allegations that the Haqqanis were a "" veritable arm "" of the ISI .
He hinted that the ISI had directed a daring guerrilla assault on the US embassy in Kabul on 13 September , as well as a giant truck bomb three days earlier that wounded 77 US soldiers at a base south of Kabul .
But in recent days the White House and State Department have rowed back on Mullen 's comments , saying that while the ISI has allowed the Haqqanis to operate from Pakistani soil there is no evidence that Pakistani spies directed the embassy assault .
The furore has left Pakistan more estranged than ever from its Afghan neighbours and its putative American allies .
A senior Pakistani intelligence official insisted to the Guardian that the Haqqanis operate from Afghan soil , echoing comments Sirajuddin Haqqani recently made in an interview from Reuters .
But he said he admitted that Haqqani 's father , the elderly Jalaluddin who founded the militant network in the 1980s , is resident in Miram Shah , the main town in North Waziristan in Pakistan 's tribal belt .
Jalaluddin is seriously ill and living in the town with relatives , the Pakistani official said .
He did not offer any proof to back up his assertion .
A senior western official in the region confirmed that Haqqani senior was "" bedridden "" .
But , he added , "" I do n't know where that bed is . """
2011-10-05,"India 's decision to underwrite and , in effect , guarantee Hamid Karzai 's feeble Afghan government is not wholly lacking in logic .
In a strategic pact signed on Tuesday , the two countries pledged to co - operate on trade and counter - terrorism , and Delhi agreed to train and equip Afghan security forces .
With US and Nato forces edging towards the exit in 2014 , it follows that Delhi , the region 's military and economic heavyweight and an aspiring superpower , should take up the strategic slack .
But that is not how Pakistan or the Taliban will see the newly announced bilateral security , political and commercial "" partnership "" .
India may yet pay heavily for its presumption .
India 's role , or "" meddling "" , in Afghanistan is already viewed with enormous suspicion in Islamabad , which nurtures a visceral fear of encirclement arising from its bruising , losing wars with its far larger southern neighbour .
Pakistan privately regards Afghanistan as its own backyard , to such an extent that it is widely believed to fund and collude with terrorist groups such as the Haqqani network in order to maintain its influence and keep the Kabul government weak and off - balance . ""
Pakistan has pursued a double game toward Afghanistan , and using terrorism as a means continues , "" Karzai complained this week before travelling to India .
Pakistan – or at least elements of its security and intelligence services – has been accused by Kabul of complicity in last month 's murder of Burhanuddin Rabbani , the former Afghan president and peace talks negotiator .
India , meanwhile , has detected Pakistan 's hand in the bombing of its Kabul embassy in 2008 and again in 2009 , as well as terrorist attacks on Indian soil .
Pakistan denies all the allegations .
Demonstrating that he , too , can play both sides against the middle , Karzai offered reassurances on Wednesday that the partnership deal with India was not aimed at Islamabad . ""
Pakistan is a twin brother , India is a great friend .
The agreement that we signed yesterday with our friend will not affect our brother … the signing of the strategic partnership with India is not directed against any country .
It is not directed against any other entity .
This is for Afghanistan to benefit from the strength of India , "" he said .
Karzai 's sudden attack of tact is not born of bonhomie .
It reflects the political reality that a lasting settlement in Afghanistan is impossible without Pakistan 's agreement , or at least acquiescence .
Writing in the Washington Post , John Podesta and Caroline Wadhams of the Centre for American Progress voiced widely shared American exasperation that Pakistan 's leaders were not using their unmatched influence to advance a constructive vision for Afghanistan . ""
Pakistani officials appear unwilling to articulate a preferred alternative strategy [ or ] a desired end - state … instead , Pakistani engagement in Afghanistan for the past 10 years has taken the form of hedging and spoiling , "" they wrote .
Karzai 's attempt to sweeten the pill may also reflect his desire to keep open the possibility of a negotiated settlement with the many - headed Taliban despite Rabbani 's death and the continuing insurgent violence .
The Taliban will not have forgotten India 's backing of the non - Pashtun Northern Alliance in the 1990s , which eventually swept them from power in 2001 with US help .
The idea of India playing an enhanced security role inside Afghanistan , as agreed in Delhi this week , is thus likely to be rejected by them as more unwelcome foreign interference .
Karzai noted bitterly last week that if peace were ever to come to Afghanistan , his government needed to talk to Pakistan , not India or the US .
India has been expanding its involvement in Afghanistan since 2001 , opening provincial consulates , embarking on road and infrastructure programmes , and donating about $ 2bn in bilateral aid .
But this week 's agreement represents a substantial and risky increased commitment .
Nobody in Delhi is talking about Indian troops or security forces on the ground in Afghanistan .
But the Afghan forces training role India has accepted marks it out as Nato 's successor , and potentially a target for insurgent wrath .
Manmohan Singh , India 's prime minister , seemed to brush aside such concerns when he met Karzai .
"" Our co - operation with Afghanistan is an open book .
We have civilisational links , and we are both here to stay …
India will stand by the people of Afghanistan as they prepare to assume responsibility for governance and security after the withdrawal of international forces in 2014 , "" Singh said .
These are fateful words .
They may come back to haunt the Indians once the Americans have gone .
Given the rapid fraying of US - Pakistani relations since the discovery earlier this year of Osama bin Laden living in a Pakistani garrison town , and given the deep unpopularity of the Afghan war at home , Washington is doubtless quite happy to let its bumptious new ally India pick up the challenge of preventing Afghanistan slipping back into civil war .
It enables Barack Obama , or his successor , to claim that the war was not in vain and has been followed through with a regionally guaranteed settlement .
India 's leaders one day may come to rue their vainglorious generosity in picking up the hot potato that the US , Britain and the rest all gingerly dropped .
It seems a high price to pay for outflanking Pakistan ."
2011-10-17,"Pakistani militants are exploiting a security vacuum left by the departure of US troops from a swath of eastern Afghanistan to mount attacks inside Pakistan , triggering cross - border violence that has claimed dozens of lives and inflamed already tense relations between Islamabad and Kabul .
The Pakistani military on Monday called on the government of Hamid Karzai to arrest and hand over Maulvi Fazlullah , a Pakistani Taliban leader also known as "" Mullah Radio "" who , it said , had been using Afghan soil to mount cross - border raids that have killed dozens of soldiers in recent months . ""
Information about these individuals and groups has been passed to the Afghan government and Nato but no action has been taken , "" said Major General Athar Abbas , the Pakistani military spokesman .
"" Fazlullah is going from strength to strength , day by day . ""
Afghans claim that the Pakistani military has responded to the incursions by indiscriminately firing artillery across the border , hitting villages in attacks that have killed at least 43 civilians since last May. "" They want to destroy Afghanistan , "" Ehsanullah , a 25-year - old teacher from Kunar province told the Guardian . ""
They want people to rise up and demonstrate against the government and the Americans . ""
Most fighting in Afghanistan is concentrated in the south and west , in territory controlled by Taliban and Haqqani network fighters .
But the Taliban 's Pakistani cousins have taken advantage of the US departure from Kunar and Nuristan , in the east , to open a new front in the conflict .
President Barack Obama pulled most US forces from the two provinces in 2009 as part of the "" surge "" into the southern provinces .
American generals considered them virtual lost causes .
Taliban fighters had overrun a small US base in Nuristan in 2008 , killing nine US soldiers , while years of fighting in Kunar 's Korengal valley had caused heavy casualties with little progress to show .
Now about 3,500 US troops remain in Kunar but none in Nuristan .
The diminished western presence has facilitated Pakistani Taliban fighters , led by Fazlullah , who fled the Swat valley following a major offensive in 2009 .
They have joined forces with local fighters and Maulvi Faqir Muhammad , another Pakistani fugitive , to mount attacks into Pakistan .
In June , Taliban fighters rounded up 16 Pakistani border guards in Dir district and killed them on video .
In late August , hundreds of fighters slipped into neighbouring Chitral for a night raid that killed at least 35 soldiers as they slept in their tents , prompting the first Pakistani army deployment to the area since the Taliban insurgency began .
Pakistani forces have responded to the incursions by shelling suspected Taliban positions .
But some shells have crossed into Afghanistan , often landing in inhabited areas .
Sadar Owila , an elder from Kunar , narrowly avoided death in mid - September when , he claimed , a Pakistani shell exploded beside his vehicle moments after he entered a mosque . ""
The windows shattered and my driver was injured by shrapnel , "" he said .
"" The people in the mosque said that if they die there , at least they will go to paradise . ""
He added that over 100 families had left the border area for safety elsewhere .
Aminullah Amarkhil , a police chief in charge of a 100-mile stretch of frontier , said that 43 people had been killed and 54 wounded since May.
Abbas , the Pakistani spokesman , admitted some shells were falling in Afghanistan , but said it was not "" intentional fire "" .
The cross - border shelling has led to a storm of protest in Kabul , where parliamentarians have angrily accused President Karzai of "" going soft "" on Pakistan to facilitate contacts with the Taliban .
A profusion of conspiracy theories and misinformation on both sides of the border further complicates matters .
Many Afghans see the Pakistani shelling as part of a nefarious policy directed by the main military spy service , Inter - Services Intelligence .
Several villagers from border regions told the Guardian that Pakistan was trying to clear civilians from the areas , or seize control of the Kunar river .
Many insisted their territory was largely insurgent free and said Pakistani accounts of Taliban attacks were overblown .
But across the border , senior politicians and police officials claimed Nato soldiers were orchestrating the Taliban raids as part of an unspecified plot to destabilise Pakistan .
"" The Nato forces and the Indian army are helping these people .
They are supporting them , giving money to them , running training camps .
It is quite clear , "" said Muhammad Anwar Khan , a provincial parliamentarian with the ruling Pakistan People 's party from Upper Dir .
The Pakistani indignation has an ironic twist .
The military has long been accused of supporting Taliban fighters in Waziristan and other tribal districts at the western end of the border ; now they find themselves under attack in the opposite direction on the eastern side .
While intensified US operations in southern Afghanistan over the last two years have produced impressive results – the number of attacks initiated by insurgents on Nato and Afghan forces are well down on previous years – the east has deteriorated .
And Kunar and Nuristan pose particular problems .
Although the provinces , with their multiple smuggling routes and cross - border traffic by insurgents , lumber smugglers and other groups , are important to both the government and the militants , they are also exceptionally difficult to control .
The latest exchanges could be a harbinger of what lies ahead after most western troops leave in 2014 .
Western strategy hinges on handing control to a beefed - up Afghan army supported by a much smaller western contingent of perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers .
But if the Pakistani and Afghan governments have failed to secure their common border areas by then , the Taliban could step up attacks in both directions across the porous border , with dire consequences for stability in both countries ."
2011-10-23,"The US reacted with dismay on Sunday after the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , said that he would side with Pakistan in the event of any war with America .
Karzai 's remarks will be greeted with outrage by an American public already thinking him ungrateful for US military and financial support .
In an interview on Geo Television , Pakistan 's largest satellite network , hours after a visit to the region by the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , Karzai said : "" If there is war between Pakistan and America , we will stand by Pakistan . ""
He put his hand on his heart and described Pakistan as a "" brother "" country .
The remark , which went further than other Karzai outbursts critical of the US , was viewed negatively not only in the US but in Afghanistan where opponents accused him of hypocrisy given Kabul 's difficult relationship with Pakistan .
The US embassy in Kabul , responding to reporters ' questions , said it was up to the Afghan government to explain Karzai 's remarks .
An embassy spokesman , Gavin Sundwall , tried to play down the row .
He told the Associated Press : "" This is not about war with each other .
This is about a joint approach to a threat to all three of our countries : insurgents and terrorists who attack Afghans , Pakistanis and Americans . ""
A western diplomat , speaking anonymously , described Karzai 's comments as unfortunate . ""
The phraseology could have been better , "" the diplomat said .
Karzai 's words were being interpreted as an attempt to mollify Pakistan ahead of a US - Afghanistan military strategic agreement to be completed within the next few months . ""
[ Karzai 's remarks are ] essentially reassurance to Pakistan that the US strategic relationship will not be used to threaten Pakistan , "" the diplomat said .
The statement was widely interpreted as a rhetorical flourish rather than as a significant offer of defence co - operation .
Despite tension between Pakistan and the US , open warfare is a remote possibility .
Clinton on Sunday said there were no plans to put US troops into Pakistan but acknowledged differences with the country over securing an Afghan peace deal .
"" We have to have a very firm commitment to an Afghan - led reconciliation peace process , "" Clinton told CNN , adding that Pakistan was not yet fully aboard . ""
We 're about 90 % to 95 % in agreement between the US and Pakistan about the means of our moving toward what are commonly shared goals , and we have a work plan and a real commitment to making sure we are as effective as possible together . ""
Clinton 's comments follow her warning to Pakistan that the US would act unilaterally if Islamabad failed to crack down on the Taliban - linked Haqqani network inside its North Waziristan sanctuary .
Karzai , who is scrambling to ensure his political future before the US military drawdown in 2014 , needs Pakistani help to bring the Taliban to peace talks .
In the event of a conflict , his army , which is dependent on US money and training , would be in no position to back Pakistan .
Nevertheless , the interview with Geo was at stark variance with the tone during the visit to the region by Clinton and David Petraeus , the CIA director .
Clinton had flown to Islamabad and , in a four - hour meeting with Pakistan 's top generals , called on the military to bring the Haqqanis to the negotiating table , destroy the group 's leadership , or pave the way for the US to do so .
Karzai 's interview with Geo was aired barely 24 hours after Clinton left .
He said Afghanistan owed Pakistan a great debt for sheltering millions of refugees over the past three decades , and stressed that his foreign policy would not be dictated by any outside power .
"" Anybody that attacks Pakistan , Afghanistan will stand with Pakistan , "" he said .
"" Afghanistan will never betray their brother . ""
Karzai has wildly swung away from , and then closer to , Pakistan over the past 18 months as efforts to draw the Taliban into peace talks have gained momentum .
First he welcomed the Pakistani military chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , and the ISI spy chief , General Shuja Pasha , to talks in Kabul but then , this month , flew to New Delhi to sign a "" strategic partnership "" with India that strengthened trade and security ties between the two countries but infuriated Pakistan , where the movewas seen as a fresh sign of Afghan perfidy .
Karzai is trying to strike a balance , reaching a peace deal but also managing criticism from non - Pashtun groups and their political representatives , who accuse him of getting too close to Pakistan ."
2011-10-23,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has said he would side with Pakistan in the event of war with the US in a surprising political twist that is likely to disconcert his western allies .
"" If there is war between Pakistan and America , we will stand by Pakistan , "" Karzai said in a television interview .
He put his hand on his heart and described Pakistan as a "" brother "" country .
The statement was widely interpreted as a rhetorical flourish rather than a significant offer of defence co - operation .
Despite recent tension between Pakistan and the US , open warfare is a remote possibility .
Karzai – who is scrambling to ensure his political future in advance of the US military drawdown in 2014 – needs Pakistani help to bring the Taliban to peace talks .
In the event of any conflict , his army , which is wholly dependent on US money and training , would be in no position to back Pakistan .
Nevertheless , the interview with Geo , Pakistan 's largest network , was at stark variance with the tone set during a visit to the region by Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , and David Petraeus , the CIA director , days earlier .
In Kabul , Clinton bluntly warned Pakistan that the US would act unilaterally if Islamabad failed to crack down on the Taliban - linked Haqqani network inside its North Waziristan sanctuary .
She then flew to Islamabad to deliver the message in person during a four - hour meeting with Pakistan 's top generals , calling on them to bring the Haqqanis to the negotiating table , kill the group 's leadership or pave the way for the US to do so .
Karzai 's interview with Geo was aired barely 24 hours after Clinton left the region .
He said Afghanistan owed Pakistan a great debt for sheltering millions of refugees over the past three decades , and stressed that his foreign policy would not be dictated by any outside power .
"" Anybody that attacks Pakistan , Afghanistan will stand with Pakistan , "" he said .
"" Afghanistan will never betray their brother . ""
Karzai has wildly swung away from , and then closer to , Pakistan over the past 18 months as efforts to draw the Taliban into peace talks have gained momentum .
First he welcomed the Pakistani military chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , and the ISI spy chief , General Shuja Pasha , to talks in Kabul .
But then this month he flew to New Delhi to sign a "" strategic partnership "" with India that strengthened trade and security ties between the two countries but infuriated Pakistan , where it was seen as a fresh sign of Afghan perfidy .
Karzai is trying to strike a delicate balance between reaching a peace deal and managing stringent criticism from non - Pashtun groups and their political representatives , who accuse him of drawing too close to Pakistan .
The latest comments reignited that criticism , as evidenced in lively debates on Afghan television talkshows on Sunday .
Karzai has appeared increasingly isolated since the killing of his powerful half - brother Ahmed Wali Karzai and peace envoy Burhanuddin Rabbani .
Analysts say Pakistani policy is driven by a desire to ensure that its arch - rival India does not enjoy political or military support from Kabul .
Pakistan 's military and ISI spy service have offered to facilitate talks with the Taliban but can not become a guarantor to their success , an official told the Dawn newspaper .
"" Pakistan must not be blamed in case of failure of attempts [ by the US ] for reconciliation with the Taliban as it does not spoon - feed them , "" the official said ."
2011-11-11,"Afghanistan 's communications infrastructure has become the latest casualty of the intensified war between Nato and the Taliban , with mobile phone companies reporting crippling attacks on their network of transmission masts .
The onslaught came in the wake of a decree by Hamid Karzai ordering phone companies to defy insurgent demands to shut down transmission networks in large parts of the country during the night .
The mobile phone networks are a key battleground in the war on the Taliban as the vast majority of anti - insurgent tipoffs from Afghan civilians are made at night , through phone calls .
The phone industry says the damage has been so great that the numbers of hours of coverage available to all phone users has fallen significantly – the first time there has been such a fall .
After a decade of explosive growth in public access to phones , which are now part of everyday life for millions of Afghans , the falloff is an extraordinary change of fortunes for an industry that is often cited as one of the country 's biggest post-2001 success stories .
The Taliban began attacking transmission masts in 2007 , but the damage was limited and the attacks were often aimed only at extorting money from companies .
But since mid - summer attacks have soared , with up to 30 towers being destroyed or damaged in one 20-day period .
Previously a loss of five would be considered a bad month .
Insurgents have also become much more destructive .
"" They used to just blow up our fuel tanks , "" a senior executive of an Afghan telecoms company said .
"" Now they put fuel inside the control room with all the equipment , absolutely destroying everything . ""
Some masts have even been blown completely out of the ground by insurgents wiring them up with huge quantities of explosives .
And they have focused many attacks on critical hub relay towers , which has the effect of bringing down services in many other locations .
In some cases entire provinces have lost all phone services for days on end .
"" We have heard that the Taliban now have telecom engineers advising them on how they should attack our sites , "" said another executive from one of the country 's main phone providers .
By forcing a night - time communications blackout the Taliban demonstrate the continued weakness of the Afghan government , western officials say .
But it is stopping anti - insurgent tipoffs that is really key .
"" If the masts are off Afghans ca n't report anything , "" said Beth Bierden , the US military director of Telecommunication Advisory Team , based at Nato 's headquarters in Kabul .
"" If you see an insurgent you ca n't call the police to say check this out . ""
Special forces ' night - time kill and capture operations also substantially rely on intelligence gleaned from tipoffs and phone intercepts .
Not surprisingly the US has made several efforts to drag the telecom companies into the war effort , even to the extent of spending tens of millions of dollars on a largely unused parallel phone system .
But after 12 July the Afghan government also joined the campaign to force the country 's mobile phone companies to defy the Taliban after Karzai , sitting in his presidential palace in Kabul , was unable to call friends , allies and government officials in the key southern city of Kandahar .
Earlier that same day the president 's powerbroking brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai , had been shot dead by his own bodyguard and the president was frantically working out how to retain his family 's grip on Kandahar .
Furious , Karzai then issued a decree ordering the phone companies to turn on their masts or risk losing their licenses .
Kandahar City has enjoyed 24-hour coverage ever since , but the Taliban responded by ratcheting up their attacks .
Despite US and government pressure the phone companies have still not completely complied , fearing even more attacks on their masts , offices and staff if they agree .
"" We 're not going to turn on our masts and become part of the army of the Afghan government , "" said an executive .
"" I 'm not going to switch on my sites because my towers are being attacked , my people are being attacked and the government is not doing anything to help me . ""
The US has spent millions of dollars finding other ways to bring round - the - clock phone calls to the insurgency 's heartlands .
One $ 68 m initiative involved building 20 masts on secured Nato bases deep inside Taliban territory in the Helmand river valley and along the southern portion of Highway One .
They hoped villagers would then roam on to the US - provided network after the main carriers turned off their masts in the evening .
But all four major phone companies refused to co - operate , fearing the rest of their network would be attacked , not just in insecure areas , but also in more stable parts of the country .
Even clever technical fixes to conceal the identity of the phone company carrying the calls were rejected .
"" They said it was going to be anonymous , but some Talib sitting in Sangin ca n't read English anyway , "" the tower provider said .
"" He is not going to know which company it is , but he 'll attack them all the same .
""
The industry 's rejection of the plan means that although all 20 masts are on , almost no one is using them .
Calls can only be made with a US - military - provided sim card , and callers can only make emergency calls to the police and army within the same tiny network .
In the words of one telecoms expert , the US - built network is almost certainly "" the most expensive phone network in the world "" on a per user basis .
The industry is also appalled by the huge price tag put on a barely used network , with one executive calculating that for $ 68 m most companies could have built almost 300 masts .
Bierden conceded that the project was not gaining as many callers as they wanted , but insisted the programme would be expanded .
Future plans include an additional 23 district capitals receiving the US - provided phone masts .
The hope is the US towers will eventually be handed over to Afghan Telecom , a state - owned company that does not have its own GSM network . ""
By putting these networks out there , we can help solve that security problem , "" Bierden said .
"" By allowing people to talk to each other the insurgents do n't have the upper hand . """
2011-11-14,"A tribal gathering to debate a long - term military and economic pact between Afghanistan and the US after most foreign troops quit the country has been widely dismissed as a mere rubber stamp for decisions already made by Hamid Karzai .
But the four - day meeting of politicians and elders – due to start on Wednesday in a secondhand beer tent – has already generated death threats and boycotts by the Afghan president 's political enemies and raised the spectre of Taliban attacks .
Kabul police said they shot dead a suicide bomber who tried to enter the tent where this week 's loya jirga will be held to discuss the scope of future relations with the US and efforts to breathe life into Taliban peace talks .
The man , who was apparently trying to get into the Kabul Polytechnic buildings in the same enclosure as the jirga tent , was shot before he could do any damage .
Two other people were later arrested .
Security around the cavernous tent , which once housed Oktoberfest drinkers before being donated to Afghanistan by Germany in 2002 , has been high for days .
On Wednesday it will host around 2,000 politicians , tribal powerbrokers and elders from around the country .
Every intersection of every major road in the sleepy residential neighbourhood near the tent has been manned by armoured vehicles and Afghan soldiers on alert .
The last time a gathering of tribal elders was held at the site last summer the meeting was attacked by rockets and insurgents wearing suicide vests .
But the Taliban claimed to have already undermined the security laid on for this year 's discussion by publishing online what they said was a "" re - composed "" version of the official security plans for event , including a satellite image of the venue and phone numbers of key officials .
The Taliban said they proved they had top - level informants within the Afghan government .
Afghan and Nato officials said the documents were fake .
But even if it was just an elaborate "" fabricated piece of propaganda "" , in Nato 's phrase , the Taliban have nonetheless paid the four - day jirga a compliment by focusing so much time and effort on trying to disrupt it .
Last month they vowed to execute anyone who attended .
The conventional wisdom among diplomats and analysts is that the meeting will be heavily stage - managed to do exactly what Karzai requires of it .
"" It 's all about artificially generating legitimacy , with all the real decisions taken behind the curtain "" a senior government official said .
Karzai 's fear , he said , was that in signing a strategic partnership without national consensus – however spurious –
he would look like "" an American puppet "" .
Even one jirga attendee who is firmly in the Karzai camp admitted the meeting would not have much legitimacy . ""
Honestly , most of the members of the jirga will be friends of the government , "" said Moen Marastial , an ex - MP and former Karzai election campaign manager .
"" They have been chosen by the government and they are most likely to support whatever the government has decided .
"" Karzai 's political opponents are appalled by the whole thing , denouncing it as illegitimate and a pale imitation of a loya jirga as described by the country 's constitution .
Many fear Karzai 's successive use of what are now called "" traditional "" loya jirgas lays the groundwork for an illegal rewriting of the country 's constitution , perhaps even to extend his rule .
More than a 100 MPs have vowed to boycott it , and it was denounced by opposition leaders at a conference in Kabul on Sunday .
Under discussion will also be Karzai 's proposal to abandon peace talks with the Taliban in favour of dealing directly with the Pakistani government ."

2011-11-16,"Hamid Karzai has told a national gathering of Afghan elders that he will not sign a much - delayed military pact with the US until night raids by foreign forces come to an end , a demand that threatens to complicate the deal .
In a fiery speech on Wednesday at the opening session of a loya jirga , a grand assembly of more than 2,000 delegates held amid tight security , the Afghan president said continued US military and economic help after the end of the Nato combat mission in 2014 was vital to avoid civil war .
But he presented himself as the leader of a proud country whose sovereignty must be respected , and set firm terms to be met before any deal could be concluded .
"" We want to have a strong partnership with the US and Nato , but with conditions , "" he said .
"" We want our national sovereignty , and an end to night raids and to the detention of our countrymen . ""
Night raids and Nato - run prisons have long been the main sticking points between the two sides during private negotiations .
Some diplomats have predicted the president 's rhetoric on the raids could reduce room for compromise and delay the signing of a strategic partnership .
Many Afghans see night raids and house searches as grave insults to the Afghan tradition of respect for the sanctity of private homes .
But military commanders say such operations are an effective tool against Taliban fighters and have the added advantage of minimising Afghan and Nato casualties compared with daylight operations .
An Afghan official said Karzai did not expect to achieve a complete end to night raids , but wanted Afghans to be put in charge of such operations .
"" That 's what needs to change to give true meaning to Afghan sovereignty and an equal partnership , "" the official said .
In a portion of his speech that prompted applause and cheering , Karzai said that western powers should not "" interfere in our internal affairs "" , adding : "" The relationship between us and the Americans should be like two independent countries , definitely independent . ""
In recent years foreign pressure to curb corruption and to root out fraud during the 2009 presidential election has been resented by Karzai .
To the delight of his audience he said that although the US was powerful , Afghanistan was nonetheless a "" lion "" . ""
In the jungle everyone is scared , even of the sick lion , "" he said .
"" America should treat us like a lion .
We are ready to sign a strategic agreement between a lion and the US . ""
Despite his denunciation of US military tactics , Karzai praised progress made in developing Afghanistan in the past decade and said the country must strike a long - term pact to avoid slipping back into civil war , as happened after the US lost interest in Afghanistan in the early 1990s .
It was a view echoed by the jirga 's chairman , Sibghatullah Mojaddedi , a former president of the country , who said a strategic partnership was vital to curb interference in Afghan affairs by Pakistan . ""
If Pakistan thinks the Afghan nation will be a slave and puppet government they are just dreaming , "" he said .
Karzai also sought to reassure Afghanistan 's neighbours , who are wary of a long - term US presence in the country .
Karzai promised the US would never be allowed to launch strikes against other regional powers from "" Afghan soil "" ."
2011-12-01,"Taliban leaders living in Pakistan were offered resettlement packages for their families in Hamid Karzai 's failed attempt to find peace partners free from the influence of Pakistani spies , Afghan officials have revealed .
Officials said the Afghan president 's effort to find representatives to talk for the insurgents were scuppered by their unwillingness to jeopardise families given sanctuary in Pakistan , where they live under the sway of the Inter - Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) , which is accused of supporting the Taliban .
The initiative highlights the extraordinary grip Pakistan has over the Taliban leadership .
And it showed the desire of the Karzai government to peel away a faction within the Quetta Shura , the insurgency 's main decision - making body .
One diplomat in Kabul said families of high - ranking Taliban are often moved around Pakistan against their will and live under a loose house arrest .
To overcome the problem the Afghan government , with Nato backing , hatched secret plans to move entire families to protected areas in Afghanistan . ""
Such an operation would be difficult but not impossible , "" said a senior Afghan government official who did not wish to be named .
"" We have a red line on allowing our security forces to conduct operations inside Pakistan , but we were prepared to move the families .
It would not have been a James Bond - style operation .
We would have just used a few henchmen . ""
The effort never came to anything , he said , and the most recent offers to move families are on hold after the assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani , Karzai 's peace envoy .
After Rabbani 's death in September the Afghan president abandoned efforts to talk to the Taliban , saying he would engage directly with Pakistan .
Foreign experts and Afghan officials say the issue of families is a big stumbling block to peace efforts , giving the ISI an iron grip over the Taliban . ""
Every Taliban commander has his family in Pakistan , "" said a former Afghan official who has met the insurgents ' representatives in the past .
He said the ISI tried to ensure all high - ranking Taliban kept their families in Pakistan .
That included Quetta Shura members , frontline commanders and the "" shadow governors "" running the Taliban 's alternative government in the Afghanistan 's 34 provinces .
"" It is a deliberate policy of ISI , who can not trust people to fight unless they bring their family to Pakistan , "" the official said .
"" Any Taliban leader who wants to do something different will have to think twice because the family will be at risk .
"" That is what happened when it was revealed earlier this year that a Taliban functionary , Tayeb Agha , had been holding secret talks with the Americans . ""
The story is that his family house was immediately surrounded and secured by the Pakistani police , "" said Antonio Giustozzi , research fellow in the Crisis States Centre at the London School of Economics .
"" His father was put under house arrest until Agha returned to Pakistan . ""
"" There is a group interested in talks , "" a western official said .
"" They are fed up with the way they live : they know they are being used by Pakistan and that they can be manipulated at a moment 's notice . ""
Karzai has struggled to turn such disillusionment into substantive talks , and has suffered a series of setbacks in his efforts to talk to the other side .
In February 2010 , Abdul Ghani Baradar , one of the Taliban 's most senior leaders who is from Karzai 's Popolzai tribe , was arrested in Pakistan after he was found to have been talking unilaterally to the Afghans .
Islamabad refused to hand over Baradar 's young son to Afghan custody , despite lobbying by Kabul .
Last year it was revealed that a man posing as a Taliban envoy who met the Afghan president was an impostor .
The final disaster for Karzai 's policy was when a Taliban suicide bomber killed Rabbani .
Although the peace process is now generally thought to be on hold , foreign diplomats say the US has kept open lines of communication with the Taliban .
Unlike the rounds involving Agha , the latest talks are being kept as secret as possible .
One American official said the process is being led by Marc Grossman , the US special representative to the region , who remains convinced a Taliban group can be "" peeled off "" from Pakistani influence . ""
Details about this process are in very short supply , "" said Giustozzi .
"" But the fact that it is continuing suggests the Pakistanis are allowing it to happen and have their own people involved .
In that sense , it has their backing . """
2011-12-04,"The head of an internationally backed corruption watchdog in Afghanistan has warned that members will resign in protest if the government of President Hamid Karzai does not start prosecuting senior officials .
Speaking in the runup to Monday 's Bonn conference on Afghanistan , Drago Kos severely criticised the two Afghan institutions in charge of tackling corruption : the attorney general 's office and the high office of oversight ( HOO ) .
"" We are not satisfied with their work .
If they take the lead , there will be impunity .
Nobody is ever brought to court .
There are no prosecutions .
Cases just stop at the HOO or the police or the attorney general 's office .
Orally , they support our work , but nothing is done , "" said Kos .
The independent anti - corruption monitoring and evaluation committee was created this year largely at the prompting of the US and British governments , but Kos said so far there had been no prosecutions of top Afghan figures implicated in corruption .
"" We will have no problem to leave as soon as possible .
If there are no changes , there is no point for us to stay .
We are out of here , "" said Kos , who also chairs the Council of Europe 's anti - corruption group .
Ten years ago an agreement in Bonn formally recognised the Karzai government after the fall of the Taliban and marked the formation of the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) .
A decade on , Karzai is still battling the Taliban and Isaf is due to withdraw its combat forces with no victory in sight .
Kos , like many western officials in Kabul , sees endemic corruption as a principal factor in the stalemate .
"" Corruption is Afghanistan 's number one problem .
It 's not security , not the Taliban .
Those are dramatic but corruption affects the lives of all the people .
It is felt by everyone . ""
Last year the country 's largest private financial institution , Kabul Bank , virtually collapsed after some $ 900 m in unsecured loans to insiders such as the president 's brother , Mahmoud Karzai , and Abdul Haseen Fahim , the brother of vice - president Qasim Fahim .
Kos said it : "" It was not a bank .
It was a Ponzi scheme . ""
So far there have been no prosecutions .
"" This government has to prove it is serious .
Only way to prove that is by bringing people in top position to court , "" he said .
He criticised the attorney general 's strategy of putting the recouping of the lost funds over prosecutions .
"" We say it is easier to bargain with suspects when your freeze their assets , "" he said .
The attorney general 's office rejected criticism of its investigation of the Kabul Bank , which it said was progressing "" normally "" .
The deputy attorney general , Rahmatullah Nazari , said : "" MEC has asked us for a clarification , but it shared the issue with the media before our clarification . ""
Some western officials suggested it would be impossible , after more than three decades of warfare , to hold the Kabul government to too high a standard , and called on the international community to be realistic in its expectations of the Bonn conference .
A senior US official said : "" Success would be an Afghan state that is stable enough to have a minimal level of confidence of its citizens .
A state that would be able to secure itself past 2014 , on the road to democracy and a decreasing dependence on aid . ""
The official pointed to a recent national opinion survey by the Asia Foundation which found that 73 % of Afghans asked thought the government was doing a good job .
More respondents ( 46 % ) said the country was moving in the right direction , than said it was moving the wrong way ( 35 % ) .
Among the pessimists , nearly half said security was the main problem , while only 16 % cited corruption .

2011-12-04,"The appalling case of Gulnaz ( Afghan woman jailed for being raped to be freed – if she marries her attacker , 2 December ) is a stark reminder of how much is at stake over women 's human rights in Afghanistan , as it moves ever closer to talks with the Taliban and a future without international forces in the country .
For years we 've been deeply concerned at the imprisonment of Afghan women for zina or "" moral "" crimes and it 's totally unacceptable that this is still going on .
Hamid Karzai 's intervention in this one case appears to do nothing to address the underlying injustice of allowing women to be jailed for "" immorality "" , shockingly , even when they have been the victim of rape .
The wider concern now is that the highly secretive reconciliation talks with the Taliban will involve the Afghan government trading away women 's rights .
The international meeting in Bonn today to discuss the future of Afghanistan needs to ensure that women 's rights are reinforced , not diluted as a sop to armed groups or the country 's cultural conservatives .

A 352,000-strong Afghan army is estimated to cost $ 8bn per year ( Report , 2 December ) .
Average income in Afghanistan is $ 900 a head .
This army under the new plans will cost almost 50 % of GDP , or $ 450 per head .
How long before it all goes to pot ?
It is hard to believe that the Americans have spent $ 1 trillion of borrowed money in Afghanistan and achieved absolutely nothing , other than thousands of dead soldiers and tens of thousands of dead Afghans .

2011-12-05,"An international conference in Bonn has promised continued support for Afghanistan after the withdrawal of Nato combat troops in 2014 .
But Afghan community organisations and aid agencies said the democratic gains of the past decade were already under threat from cuts in western aid budgets .
The conference — coming exactly a decade after an international agreement in Bonn to recognise the government of Hamid Karzai and the creation of a Nato - led security force — pledged to provide economic assistance to the Afghan government until 2024 , when the International Monetary Fund predicts the country will become self - sufficient , largely from revenue from its mineral wealth .
The German foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle told the conference : "" We send a clear message to the people of Afghanistan : We will not leave you on your own .
We will not leave you in the lurch . ""
"" The United States intends to stay the course with our friends in Afghanistan , "" the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said , adding that the American commitment was for the "" long haul "" .
"" We will be there with you as you make the hard decisions that are necessary for your future . ""
But Clinton added that in return for economic support , Afghans had to live up to their commitments "" on taking difficult decisions to embrace reform , lead in their own defence and strengthen an inclusive democracy rooted in the rule of law . ""
Wazhma Frogh , an activist in the Afghan Women 's Network , welcomed the pledged support , saying : "" To many people this is just another conference on Afghanistan , but for Afghans on the ground it is more important .
People fear that they could lose their rights that they have won so far . ""
But Frogh also voiced concern that , despite the promises made at Bonn , continued support for gender equality , civil society organisations and a free media was already drying up as the West fails to escape from recession and starts cutting aid budgets .
Development aid from US , Afghanistan 's biggest donor by far , has fallen from $ 3.5 billion last year to about $ 2 billion this year .
Within that , the budget for supporting democracy , governance and civil society organisation fell by more than half from $ 231 million to $ 93 million and the allocation of support for "" rule of law "" dropped from $ 43 million to $ 16 million .
"" We are already seeing the impact of the cuts on the ground .
There is a decrease in international aid on democracy .
Projects on gender equality and strengthening the media have closed down , "" Frogh said .
Louise Hancock , Oxfam 's policy and advocacy advisor in Afghanistan said : "" The Afghan people needed to be here to hear that there will not be abandoned but at the moment it is just a lot of talk .
Already there are projects on education for girls that are shutting down , and one of the biggest fears is that when the troops go , the funds will drop , and drop quickly . ""
Britain has pledged to maintain its development aid to Afghanistan at the current level of £ 178 million a year .
William Hague said the the government would also be talking its allies in the next few months on how much would be spent on further help in supporting Afghan security forces after 2014 .
"" The conference has broadened the understanding around the world that our support will continue to be necessary .
Nobody should think about walking away after 2014 , whether it 's western Nato nations or Arab nations , "" the foreign secretary said .
The Gulf Cooperation Council is due to meet in February to discuss Arab support for the Afghan economy and its security forces .
There will be an global economic aid pledging conference in Tokyo in July and a Nato summit in Chicago the next month , where the final size of the Afghan security forces will be decided .
"" There are three reasons why I believe that the international community will continue to be generous despite the fiscal squeeze , "" Simon Gass , Nato 's top civilian representative , told the Guardian .
"" The first is that the costs after 2014 will be a fraction of what we are spending now because of the large number of troops .
Second , Afghanistan will still be one of the poorest countries on earth and would under any circumstances attract a lot of financial help .
Third , if we do not fund Afghanistan , for example by not paying for the Afghan security forces , we will put at risk all we have achieved in the last ten years . ""
This is a matter of self interest , not philanthropy .
If Afghanistan turned back to chaos , our countries would face flows of drugs and migrants , as well as instability in a sensitive part of the world . """
2011-12-05,"One of Afghanistan 's most prominent women 's rights activists , Selay Ghaffar , says she fears the fragile gains won by Afghan women over the last 10 years could be severely compromised if the international community rushes into closed - door peace talks with insurgent groups and Hamid Karzai 's government .
On Monday world leaders gather in Bonn , Germany , for the next round of talks to discuss the planned 2014 withdrawal of international troops and the transition to Afghan - run security .
But while concern for women 's rights was held up as a justification for military intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 , Ghaffar says it looks all too likely that gender equality is already off the negotiating table .
The UK government is among those quick to point out the growing visability of women in Afghan society - in schools , workplaces and political office - over the last 10 years .
But these gains are fragile , says Ghaffar , who heads up a Kabul - based NGO , Humanitarian Assistance for the Women and Children of Afghanistan , which runs women 's shelters and legal aid programmes for women in rural areas .
For example , there is now a national ministry for women 's affairs , but it is neglected , she says ; in 2008 the government launched a 10-year national action plan for women , but so far there 's little to show for it ; there are more women MPs , but they are often pushed into largely symbolic roles .
To ensure lasting change , women must be included in all stages of the transition process , says Ghaffar .
She expresses concern over the deteriorating security situation in areas currently under transition , and the failure to adequately include women in the recruitment and deployment of new security and police forces in these areas .
"" The biggest fear we have right now is reconcilliation with the Taliban , "" says Ghaffar .
"" Will women play a role in these discussions ?
Will women 's rights be part of the negotiations ?
"" Talks with insurgent groups , including the Taliban , are among the most contentious issues on the Bonn conference table .
Along with other women 's rights activists , Ghaffar has been closely tracking the series of opaque high - level international conferences on the future of Afghanistan .
Last year , when no women were invited to the conference in London , she got in with a press pass .
She has been invited to attend Bonn as a delegate -
she 's the only female civil society delegate .
Ghaffar 's invitation - and the fact that women will make up 33 % of the Afghan government delegation - seems a significant breakthrough .
However , Ghaffar is quick to temper these victories with a heavy dose of realpolitik : being allowed in the door is not the same thing as making decisions . ""
Bonn is just a formality , "" she says , angry at having been shut out of the crucial pre - conference preparations , where agendas are shaped , documents drafted and alliances built .
The way she describes it makes it sound like she 's been invited to play a game in which the winner has already been chosen .
The growing number of women in political office and leadership positions in Afghanistan is often cited as an example of success for women 's rights .
Some 28 % of Afghan parliamentarians are now women - a higher proportion than in France , Canada and Britain .
But while women may be at the table , is anyone listening to them , says Ghaffar .
"" Are they being invited to discussions ?
Are their voices really included ?
""
Similar questions have been raised regarding the participation of women in the high peace council set up by the Afghan government to negotiate with the Taliban : women hold just nine seats on the 79-member council , and women 's rights activists say these are largely symbolic positions .
This disconnect between formal representation and real social change was the subject of this year 's flagship report from the new UN agency for women , which emphasised how the huge improvements made in the legal position of women over the last century have not always been translated into progress on the ground .
Ghaffar says international aid donors must use their muscle to make sure women 's rights are explicitly recognised in any international declarations on the future of Afghanistan .
According to World Bank estimates , foreign aid accounted for nearly half of the country 's GDP in 2008 - 09 .
But Ghaffar has little praise for the multi - billion dollar international aid effort in the country , and dismisses past promises to support Afghan women as paper - thin .
In a position paper prepared ahead of Bonn , activists with the Afghan Women 's Network point out that while the focus of international aid has "" shifted drastically "" from socio - economic and development projects to those that support transition and peace processes , concern for women 's empowerment and gender equality has been largely left behind .
Ghaffar is not expecting anything dramatic to come out of the conference , but it does offer a window of opportunity .
"" We want honest commitments from the Afghan government and the international community that democracy , human rights and women 's rights will be delivered .
And that peace will come with justice . """
2011-12-14,"An Afghan woman who was jailed after being raped by a cousin has been released from the Kabul prison where she has spent more than two years , although her lawyer has warned her future remains far from certain .
Gulnaz , a 20-year - old who is known by one name , was set free on Tuesday night , nearly two weeks after Hamid Karzai , the Afghanistan president , ordered her release .
Her case has highlighted the issue of "" moral crimes "" , which lawyers say have no basis in Afghan law .
Despite being the victim of a rape at the hands of a cousin , a day labourer called Asadullah Sher Mohammad , she was charged with "" adultery "" after reporting the attack to police and sentenced to 12 years in prison .
For two years and three months
Gulnaz had been living in the Badam Bagh prison in Kabul with her daughter , who was conceived by the rape .
Karzai had come under growing pressure in the weeks leading up to the recent conference on Afghanistan held in Bonn to release Gulnaz , who has become a symbol of the highly conservative Islamic country 's failure to substantially improve the lot of women in the last 10 years .
Although the government said she would be released without any conditions , she has come under heavy pressure , including from a judge , to marry Sher Mohammad , who is in another prison in Kabul serving a rape sentence .
Kimberley Motley , an Kabul - based American lawyer who has worked on Gulnaz 's case , said she had "" major concerns "" about the extraordinary pressure her client has come under since Karzai announced her clemency – including from Sher Mohammad 's father . ""
He was allowed to have continued access to her while she was in prison , and he has been in there in the last five days to try and make her sign a document , "" she said .
"" We have no idea what this document is , and neither does she because she was unable to read it . ""
No decision has been made whether Gulnaz , who has been moved to a safe place in Kabul that her supporters do not wish to be identified , will agree to marry her attacker , although she has previously said she might do so for the sake of her daughter .
She has also demanded a dowry before agreeing to marry her attacker , and suggested that one of Sher Mohammad 's sisters should marry her brother in order to protect her from reprisals .
Motley said she should not have to marry her rapist .
"" There are women in Afghanistan who are single mothers who are able to work and to survive , "" she said .
"" She definitely has an uphill battle to fight , but it is ridiculous to say that if she does not marry this man her life is ruined .
"" Efforts to bring her plight to public attention were first made by Clementine Malpas , a British film - maker who was commissioned by the European Union to produce a documentary about women 's rights in Afghanistan .
The EU , however , refused to allow the film , called Injustice , to be distributed or broadcast , saying it would jeopardise the lives of the women involved ."
2012-01-05,"Hamid Karzai , furious at being sidelined from Afghan peace talks , has thrown his government into yet another dramatic confrontation with the international community by demanding the US hand over control of its main military prison in Afghanistan .
Officials at the US embassy and Nato headquarters in Kabul scrambled to deal with the unexpected announcement , which comes amid humiliation for Karzai over US efforts to set up an overseas political office for the Taliban despite the minimal involvement of the Afghan government .
Karzai said a commission had been established to oversee the transfer , within a month , of the detention centre at Parwan , which replaced the old prison at Bagram airbase , north of Kabul .
Bagram became infamous during the "" war on terror "" for holding the most "" high - value "" Taliban and al - Qaida detainees .
The shock announcement coincided with the parading at a press conference of two British private security workers who were arrested in Kabul on Wednesday with a car full of undocumented assault rifles .
The government said the two men would be charged for illegal gun running and their company , a Canadian organisation called GardaWorld , would be closed .
Although the US has long agreed in principle to transfer its military prisons to Afghan control , the timetable has repeatedly slipped .
The new deadline set by Karzai will be impossible to meet , not least because of grave concerns among the international community about the way Afghanistan treats the prisoners it already has responsibility for .
A UN report in October found that torture was rife in some Afghan prisons , including of inmates that had been transferred from Nato custody .
The Afghan government , however , has drawn up its own report on Bagram that Karzai said detailed "" many cases of violation of Afghan constitution and other applicable laws of the country , the relevant international conventions and human rights "" .
A senior western official closely involved in detention issues said the US was concerned that Afghan guards would have trouble maintaining the equipment at the new Parwan detention facility
Nonetheless , Karzai has been adamant his government should gain complete control over all Afghan prisons , including Bagram and the issue has been one of the key sticking points in negotiations between Washington and Kabul over a much - delayed strategic pact that will determine the US role in the country after 2014 .
"" It 's classic Karzai off his meds moment , "" said one western official in Kabul , alluding to a long track record of behaviour the international community has regarded as highly erratic .
Karzai has successfully deployed such brinkmanship before , not least in August when he stunned the diplomatic corps by ordering that tens of thousands of private security guards should be disbanded within four months .
A compromise was eventually reached that will lead to greater government oversight of private security contractors .
Afghan government officials said Karzai was extremely displeased at being kept out of secret negotiations between the US and the Taliban that look set to lead to the establishment of a political office for the insurgent movement in Qatar .
Last month Karzai withdrew his Qatari ambassador to express his anger at the plans .
Although Karzai has long favoured political efforts to bring the war to an end , he has insisted that it be controlled and organised by his government .
The Taliban think otherwise .
In a statement released this week announcing its willingness to set up an office the movement made no mention of the Afghan government whatsoever .
It said the only two parties to the conflict of any importance were the US and the insurgents themselves .
Nato 's International Security Assistance Force and the US embassy declined to comment ."
2012-01-12,"Afghan president Hamid Karzai and US defence secretary Leon Panetta have led a chorus of condemnation of American soldiers filmed urinating on the bodies of dead Afghans as "" inhumane "" and "" utterly deplorable "" .
The Pentagon said it has identified two of the four marines responsible for the latest in a series of abuses by US forces which is likely to further inflame hostility to Nato troops in Afghanistan and reinforce the perception that there is an institutional problem in the American military .
Panetta said he had viewed the graphic video of four US marines urinating on three bloodied corpses .
As they are filmed by a fifth soldier , the marines sigh with relief , laugh and make comments including "" have a great day , buddy "" and "" golden , like a shower "" .
"" I have seen the footage , and I find the behaviour depicted in it utterly deplorable , "" said Panetta .
"" Those found to have engaged in such conduct will be held accountable to the fullest extent .
"" The soldiers in the undated video , which was posted anonymously on the web , appear to be members of Scout Sniper Team 4 , a US marine unit based in North Carolina that served in Afghanistan until last autumn .
The military said it knows the names of two of those in the video and that they are no longer serving with the unit , but it declined to make their identities public .
It is not clear who the dead Afghans are .
They are possibly Taliban fighters but their corpses are not shown with weapons .
Karzai said in a statement that he was "" deeply disturbed "" by the desecration of dead bodies which is defined as a war crime by the Geneva conventions . ""
This act by American soldiers is completely inhumane and condemnable in the strongest possible terms .
We expressly ask the US government to urgently investigate the video and apply the most severe punishment to anyone found guilty in this crime , "" he said .
The Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) said it "" strongly condemns the actions depicted in the video , which appear to have been conducted by a small group of US individuals , who apparently are no longer serving in Afghanistan "" .
"" This disrespectful act is inexplicable and not in keeping with the high moral standards we expect of coalition forces , "" it said .
John McCain , a navy veteran and the leading Republican on the US senate 's armed services committee , said the video "" makes me so sad "" .
"" There should be an investigation and these young people should be punished , "" he said .
A leading negotiator in Karzai 's peace council , Arsala Rahmani , said that the film will have a "" very , very bad impact on peace efforts "" .
"" Looking at such action , the Taliban can easily recruit young people and tell them that their country has been attacked by Christians and Jews and they must defend it , "" he said .
But the Taliban , while criticising the actions of the marines as "" shameful "" , said the latest revelations of abuse by US forces will not block attempts to get talks started to bring an end to the Afghan conflict .
A Taliban spokesman , Qari Yousuf Ahmadi , told the BBC that it is not the first time Americans had carried out such a "" wild action "" .
But another different Taliban spokesman , Zabihullah Mujahid , said the video "" is not a political process , so the video will not harm our talks and prisoner exchange because they are at the preliminary stage "" .
The exposure of the video , widely viewed on the web , comes as the Obama administration attempts to begin peace talks with the Taliban before the US begins to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan .
Marc Grossman , the White House special representative , will meet Karzai in Kabul this weekend as well as officials in Turkey , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
Last week , the Taliban announced it would to set up a political office in Qatar which appears to be an important step toward negotiations .
Washington is considering reciprocating by releasing several Taliban prisoners from the Guantanamo jail as a confidence - building measure .
While the latest revelation of abuses does not appear likely to derail the latest peace effort it again raises questions about whether there is a culture of abuse in US forces serving in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Last year , 11 soldiers were convicted over the murders of three Afghan civilians by a "" kill squad "" and the subsequent cover up .
It was revealed that some of them collected body parts , including fingers and skull parts , as trophies , and posed for photographs over the corpses of their victims .
This week , a US marine went on trial over the killing of 24 Iraqis , including women and children , in their homes .
Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich faces charges of manslaughter over the killings as he commanded a group of soldiers who burst into the victims ' homes in Haditha in search of combatants .
Seven other soldiers also charged were either acquitted or had the case against them dropped .
The US military is also still grappling with the legacy of the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , and its role in the torture of alleged terrorists ."
2012-01-28,"British troops will only be withdrawn from Afghanistan when Afghan security forces are ready to take over their role , David Cameron said on Saturday .
Speaking with Afghan president Hamid Karzai at Chequers , he said "" I do n't want to see some sort of cliff edge in 2014 when all of the remaining troops come out at once but clearly , between now and 2014 , the rate at which we can reduce our troops will depend on the transition to Afghan control in the different parts of Afghanistan and that should be the same for all of the members of Nato . ""
Cameron 's comments follow the decision of France to withdraw its troops a year ahead of schedule after four French soldiers were killed by an Afghan soldier they were training .
The move has been criticised in Afghanistan .
The prime minister said Britain "" has paid a heavy price "" for fighting insurgency but insisted progress was being made .
He paid tribute to the latest British casualty in Afghanistan , a soldier from the 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment , and said his thoughts were with the man 's family .
A total of 397 British forces or Ministry of Defence personnel have died while serving in Afghanistan since October 2001 .
Cameron and Karzai signed a pledge setting out the next stage in relations between Britain and Afghanistan .
The "" enduring strategic partnership "" renews a 2005 agreement and sets out a shared vision of a secure , stable and prosperous Afghanistan able to maintain its own security and prevent the country from being used as a safe haven for international terrorists .
Cameron said the level of violence was down across the country , particularly in Helmand , and the building of the national army and police force were "" on target "" .
"" I think part of achieving that is not just what we are doing on the ground with all the Nato partners but also the need for what the president
and I have often spoken about , for a political process that ensures all Afghans , if they give up violence , if they give up terror , can play a part in a strong democratic state for the future . ""
Karzai said Britain had been Afghanistan 's "" steadfast friend "" over the last decade .
The Afghan people "" appreciate "" the sacrifices that have been made , he added .
"" May I convey to the people of Britain the gratitude of the Afghan people for all that Britain has offered Afghanistan , for having been ready to sacrifice , and having been ready to share , hard earned taxpayers ' money with Afghanistan for the benefit of Afghan life . """
2012-02-16,"Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , confronted the Pakistani leadership on Thursday on a visit to Islamabad as his frustration with the country he accuses of harbouring the Taliban boiled over .
Karzai 's language and tone flared to such an extent that the Pakistani prime minister , Yousuf Raza Gilani , intervened and called a halt to a meeting of the full delegations of the two countries , according to officials on both sides .
After a break , a smaller meeting of just the top officials was held , on the first day of a two - day visit to Islamabad .
The Afghan president has long demanded that Pakistan bring the leadership of the Taliban to the negotiating table , including its chief , Mullah Mohammad Omar .
The Afghan side 's main meeting on Thursday was with the combined Pakistani civilian and military leadership , which went on for around three hours , with the Pakistani prime minister , foreign minister , army chief and head of the intelligence service all present .
At one point , apparently directing his remarks to Pakistan 's foreign minister , Hina Rabbani Khar , Karzai asked : "" Would you be willing to stop girls studying in schools and university in Pakistan ? ""
The Taliban , when it ruled Afghanistan in the 1990s , stopped the education of girls and banned women from working .
According to one insider , Karzai also bluntly demanded that Pakistan produce the Taliban to negotiate with him during his visit to the country .
The source said that the Pakistani side was shocked by the Afghan leader 's aggression .
The nascent peace process , which offers the only hope for an end to the decade - long Afghan conflict , depends crucially on Afghanistan and Pakistan being able to co - operate .
Islamabad denies that the Taliban leadership and Mullah Omar is on its soil , but Kabul and the west believe that they have sanctuary there , giving Islamabad decisive leverage over any negotiations .
Karzai is understood to deeply resent what he feels is his government 's marginalisation in the peace dialogue , which he sees as being controlled by the US or Pakistan , despite both countries repeatedly saying they want an "" Afghan - led "" process .
US - backed efforts in recent months to open an office for the Taliban in the Gulf state of Qatar , to kickstart talks , was an initiative that Kabul felt excluded from .
Pakistan 's relationship with Afghanistan is only just recovering from accusations last year that the ISI was behind the assassination of Kabul 's peace envoy , Burhanuddin Rabbani .
Ahead of the Karzai visit , the Afghan ambassador in Islamabad , Umer Daudzai , a key adviser to the president , told a Pakistani newspaper : "" President Hamid Karzai will expect Pakistan to facilitate contacts and dialogue with Taliban . ""
Pakistan says that it will aid Kabul 's peace efforts but has never spelt out what it is capable of delivering .
Conversely , Pakistan says that it is unclear what Karzai is demanding of it .
"" We told them ( the Afghan side ) that you need to clarify what it is that you want , "" said Khar , speaking to a small group of foreign press following the official meetings .
"" We need to understand each other much better . ""
"" We will not block any process that works towards reconciliation . ""
Khar described the discussions with the Afghan delegation as "" hard "" and "" serious "" but declined to go into any details .
"" We do n't have Mullah Omar to bring , "" she said .
"" That 's the crazy perception about Pakistan .
It 's ridiculous . """
2012-02-21,"Pakistan will not support a US - driven initiative to start Afghan peace talks in Qatar until it is clear that they have the backing of the Kabul government , the Pakistani foreign minister , Hina Rabbani Khar , has said .
In an interview with the Guardian , Khar said even after a visit by the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , to Islamabad last week , it was unclear whether he really wanted his government to hold talks with the Taliban in Qatar .
The Taliban has announced its readiness to negotiate with the international community in the Gulf state and has moved some of its officials there with the encouragement of US and other western governments .
Over the course of the past two months , Karzai initially objected to Qatar being a venue , recalling his ambassador in protest when the initiative was announced .
He then appeared to relent , but recently raised the possibility of separate talks in Saudi Arabia , to the irritation of Washington officials .
"" We are waiting for him to determine the course of action of his government and once that is done , we will want to be seen to be fully supporting it
…
The messages from Kabul are a bit confusing .
At first they say they are supporting it
but they say they are recalling their ambassador because they think they have not been taken into confidence , "" Khar said .
"" For us , the dangers of being supportive of something where there is not enough clarity on whether the Afghan government is fully behind it , fully owns it , fully drives it , are too high .
The stakes are far too high . ""
She added : "" What we expect of Afghanistan and the Karzai government is that they share very clearly with the rest of the world and with us what it is they truly want to do .
Yes , they want the path towards peace and reconciliation .
They have already said that .
But how do they plan to achieve it ? ""
Khar insisted that Pakistan would not actively hinder the effort to hold talks in Qatar , and denied reports that Islamabad had blocked some Taliban officials from flying to Doha to participate .
However , in a reminder of the fragility of the Afghan - Pakistani relationship , the foreign minister again rejected Afghan pressure to allow Kabul officials have access to Taliban figures they believe to be in Pakistan , repeating longstanding Pakistani denials that Islamabad has any idea of the whereabouts of the Taliban leader , Mullah Omar .
"" I am not an authority on where Mullah Omar is , but I do know that Pakistani authorities do not know where Mullah Omar is .
I know that much , "" she said , adding : "" Pakistan 's view is that everything the Afghans ask us which is doable , which is realistic , which is based on facts , we will do … but it has to be based on facts . ""
However , Khar would not say whether Afghan officials would be allowed to meet one of Omar 's deputies , Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , who is in Pakistani custody .
During his visit to Islamabad on Friday , Karzai expressed frustration with Pakistani policy , saying "" impediments "" in the relationship should be removed "" sooner rather than later "" .
Pakistan 's ambivalence over the effort to open a dialogue in Qatar has contributed to the poor state of Pakistan 's relationship with the US , which reached a new low in November when Nato cross - border fire from Afghanistan killed 24 Pakistani soldiers .
Khar is due to meet the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , in London this week
but she said she had no power to seek an improvement in the relationship until Pakistan 's parliament had published the results of its own review .
Khar denied that her government was delegating a politically tricky issue , arguing that the parliamentary review of US policy was "" something to be proud about "" and would improve bilateral relations in the long term .
"" I think this relationship has been missing a great deal of credibility and a lot of that is because the relationship has always peaked during dictatorships and because a lot of the terms of the relationship are not very transparent , "" she said .
"" What this government is doing is trying to get some of that credibility back
…
Once you are able to do that
I think we will turn out to be much more effective partnership . ""
By way of contrast , the minister praised Pakistan 's relations with the UK , which she said worked well because they were "" predictable "" , adding that Britain had been understanding over Islamabad 's opposition to US drone strikes inside Pakistani territory .
At a joint press conference with Khar on Tuesday , William Hague described the British relationship with Pakistan as "" deep , long term and strategic . ""
The foreign secretary said Afghan - led efforts towards reconciliation and a lasting peace settlement in Afghanistan were "" vital to the long term security of Britain and Pakistan and to the region "" ."
2012-02-23,"An Afghan soldier shot dead two American soldiers , as the Taliban called for attacks on military bases and convoys in retaliation for the burning of copies of the Qur'an .
As a third day of violence raged across Afghanistan in retaliation for the desecration by US soldiers , Barack Obama sent a letter of apology to the president , Hamid Karzai . ""
President Obama has written that the incident in their facility was not intentional , and assured the president of full co - operation , "" the statement said .
Obama expressed his administration 's "" regret and apologies over the incident in which religious materials were unintentionally mishandled "" , said White House national security council spokesman Tommy Vietor .
The violence began when Afghan workers at the Bagram airbase discovered copies of the Qur'an among a pile of waste paper sent for incineration late on Monday evening , and pulled them from the flames .
Karzai told MPs that a US soldier had acted "" out of ignorance and with poor understanding "" of the Koran 's importance as Islam 's holy book , a presidential statement said .
Thousands of Afghans took to the streets the next day , and their numbers have grown as news of the burning spread across the country .
Embassies , the United Nations and other foreign organisations have restricted travel and kept their staff inside fortified compounds to protect them from possible violence .
Today demonstrators burned cars outside a Norwegian base in the north and attacked a French compound in eastern Kapisa province .
In Kabul there were some injuries but no deaths , as a heavy police presence contained riots .
Elsewhere security forces struggled to cope , and the US embassy extended a travel ban to parts of northern Afghanistan .
The Afghan National Army soldier who turned his gun on US troops appeared to have been stationed on a joint base , inside the security cordon that protected other foreign troops from the enraged crowds .
"" More than 1,000 people were protesting today in Khogyani district , and they marched towards Kaja where there is a US base , "" said Haji Mohammad Hassan , district governor for Khogyani .
"" In part of the US headquarters a soldier opened fire on the Americans , and after that ran away to hide himself among the protesters , and is still with them . ""
Two civilians were also killed when someone opened fire near the base , Hassan added , but he could not confirm the source of the shots .
Although anger has been directed at foreign troops and foreign governments , most of the 11 people killed and dozens injured have been Afghans .
A call for calm from Karzai late on Wednesday night did little to quell the rage .
There are fears of further violence on Friday if imams take up the issue in their sermons .
A report on the incident by senior clerics and Nato officials is expected to reach Karzai by the end of the week .
Obama 's was the latest in a string of rapid but apparently ineffectual efforts by top US civilian and military officials to contain the damage , which is expected to complicate efforts by Kabul and Washington to seal a strategic deal to keep some US troops in the country past 2014 .
The US and Nato commander in Afghanistan , General John Allen , rushed to deliver a fervent apology to the "" noble people of Afghanistan "" within hours of the burning .
The US defence secretary , Leon Panetta , also apologised for the "" inappropriate treatment "" of copies of the Qur'an .
In April 2011 , when news that a US pastor in Florida had burned a Qur'an reached Afghanistan , seven foreign UN workers and at least 13 Afghans were killed in protests that raged for several days ."
2012-03-02,"Hopes that the US can fix conditions for a long - term military presence in Afghanistan before an unofficial May deadline are fading because Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , is not prepared to compromise on two demands that have stalled negotiations for months .
Washington and its allies want to have the US - Afghan strategic partnership agreed before May , when a Nato conference in Chicago is expected to pledge long - term help to Kabul with finances and military training .
But negotiations have dragged on for over a year and Karzai is adamant he will not give ground on his two main demands – for Afghan control of jails and an end to night - time raids on Afghan homes .
Western officials say the first is not practical and the second would compromise the military effort .
"" If they do n't change their position there will be no strategic partnership before Chicago , "" said a senior Afghan official familiar with the negotiations .
"" We are not willing to compromise when it comes to sovereignty . ""
The strategic partnership deal would allow US forces to stay in some current large bases in Afghanistan , to help train Afghan soldiers and police .
The bases could also be used for drone strikes on militant areas in Pakistan .
The deal would give western leaders a security rationale for spending money in Afghanistan after combat troops are withdrawn in 2014 , and also aims to reassure Afghans the west will not cut and run .
A string of top diplomats and politicians have urged Karzai to sign . ""
The Afghan government , especially the Afghan president , is under a lot of pressure from all sides – there are some indirect threats being made as well , "" said the Afghan official , who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the negotiations .
But Karzai has long said that for a deal to go ahead the US must hand over all jails on Afghan soil to his government 's control and end controversial night - time hunts for insurgents and their supporters .
He repeated that position in a phone call earlier this week with the Nato secretary general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , who was urging Karzai to sign the deal ahead of the Chicago summit , according to the presidential palace . ""
Before the US - Afghan strategic partnership document can be signed , the foreigners have to respect the national sovereignty of Afghanistan , "" a palace statement , released late on Wednesday , quoted Karzai telling Rasmussen . ""
No Afghan [ prisoners ] should be in the hands of foreigners , and foreign troops should hand over all the jails they have now to the Afghan government , and stop the night raids . ""
US officials had suggested resolving the impasse by hiving off the two most controversial points into a separate document and agreeing to hash them out later , but Karzai has rejected that as a compromise of Afghan sovereignty . ""
The US idea is not accepted at all , we have to reach an agreement on these two points before signing any strategic partnership document , "" the official said .
The US is reluctant to hand over jails in part because Afghanistan 's judicial system does not currently have the capacity to run them .
Night raids are contentious because western military commanders consider them perhaps the most effective tool in their arsenal , saying they take out senior leaders with minimal risk to innocent civilians .
Afghan leaders say they are dangerous and intrusive , cause too many deaths of non - combatants and turn Afghans against the war .
Diplomatic manoeuvres that put Afghans officially in charge of prisons while leaving US forces organising day - to - day management , or gave US troops a role providing intelligence and support to Afghan - led night raids , could resolve some of the difficulties .
But western diplomats warn that Karzai may be badly misjudging the mood in an economically battered America , whose diplomats are also distracted by security concerns in other volatile areas from Syria and Yemen to Somalia . ""
The Afghans still really believe that the Americans need to be here , "" said one senior Kabul diplomat who asked not to be named .
"" I think they are underestimating how much things have changed , and US concerns are focused elsewhere – and they can not manage without this support . ""
The World Bank forecasts Kabul will have a $ 7bn ( £ 4.4bn ) hole in its annual budget after 2014 .
Mining projects may one day allow it to be self - sufficient , but they are in the very early stages of development , so foreign cash will be needed for years to pay the army .
While several other nations have signed their own long - term strategic deals – Britain has promised an officer training academy modelled on Sandhurst – all of them are unofficially contingent on a US deal ; without an American lead , no one wants to stay .
The US embassy insists that there is no timeline for a deal , although repeated unofficial deadlines have passed without anything being pinned down .
"" We are not going to comment on ongoing negotiations , "" said Gavin Sundwall , spokesman for the US embassy in Kabul .
"" We want to get the right agreement , not necessarily a quick agreement , so there are no timelines . """
2012-03-09,"The United States has agreed to transfer its main prison in Afghanistan to the control of the Afghan army .
The deal , signed on Friday , at the last minute before a deadline set by Karzai , involved compromises by both sides on an issue that has contributed to months of stalemate in US and Afghan efforts to agree a long - term strategic partnership deal .
The Bagram prison was at the heart of recent deadly protests over the burning of copies of the Qur'an by foreign forces , and has long been resented by the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , as a high - profile violation of national sovereignty .
Karzai had demanded control of the jail by Friday .
Management of the complex will now be handed over to a three - star Afghan general as soon as he is named .
The 3,000 Afghan prisoners held there will only gradually be transferred to Afghan custody over six - months , and US forces will provide "" technical and logistical support "" for a further six months .
US officials involved in the negotiations said their top general would also retain an indefinite ability to monitor prisoner conditions and veto any prisoner release through a "" bilateral committee on detentions "" .
That appears to be a tacit recognition of US concerns about Afghan capacity and standards .
The US has long said Afghanistan does not have enough trained guards for the sprawling prison , and Washington has concerns that the Afghan government has sometimes been too quick to release suspected insurgents .
The ability to monitor prisoners is critical because the US is legally bound to ensure humane treatment of anyone it detains , even if passed into other nations ' custody , and the Nato - led coalition last year halted prisoner transfer to some Afghan jails because of torture concerns .
The fate of about 50 prisoners who are not Afghan nationals is under discussion .
The first 500 Afghan prisoners could be handed over to their government 's control within 45 days , US officials said .
The west is keen to have a strategic partnership in place before a Nato conference in May which is expected to set long - term funding for Afghanistan after the 2014 withdrawal of foreign combat troops .
A deal to keep US bases in Afghanistan would allow western leaders to argue that it was not a one - way flow of benefits . ""
This memorandum is an important step forward in our strategic partnership negotiations , "" said General John Allen , commander of the US forces in Afghanistan , at the signing ceremony .
"" It is yet another example of the progress of transition , and our efforts to ensure that Afghanistan can never again be a safe haven for terrorists . "" US and Afghan officials will move on to discussing control of controversial night - time operations to capture or kill insurgents .
Karzai has said they must end before Kabul will sign off on the strategic partnership but western generals say the war is lost without them .
However Karzai 's defence minister , Abdul Rahim Wardak , suggested that a compromise might also be possible on that issue . ""
In the coming few days we will continue our negotiations with government of the United States of America , and will discuss and finalise a new document which is the Afghanisation of the special operations , "" he said at the signing ceremony . ""
By signing the special operations document and this memorandum the conditions of the government of Afghanistan will be fulfilled to pave the way for signing the strategic partnership document with United States of America . """

The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , condemned the shootings as "" intentional murders "" and demanded an explanation from the US .
The victims of the shootings , which left up to 16 civilians dead , included nine children and three women , Karzai 's office said in a statement .
"" This is an assassination , an intentional killing of innocent civilians and can not be forgiven , "" Karzai said .
He said he has repeatedly demanded the US stop killing Afghan civilians .
The White House said it was deeply concerned by initial reports of the incident and was monitoring the situation closely .
General John Allen , the top US commander in Afghanistan , issued a statement pledging a "" rapid and thorough investigation "" into the shooting spree , and said the soldier will remain in US custody .
Eleven members of one family who lived just a few hundred metres from the soldier 's base in the Panjwai district of southern Kandahar province were killed when he broke into their compound after 3 am and sprayed it with bullets , villager Ustad Abdul Halim said .
The father of the family , Wazir , and one child survived only because they were away from their home . ""
Wazir and his young son were in Boldak district when it happened , "" Halim said by phone from the village , where survivors and government officials from nearby Kandahar city gathered to bury the dead .
The attacks took place in the villages of Balandi and Alkozai , and the US soldier went into three different houses and opened fire , Associated Press reported .
The area is a former Taliban stronghold that has seen years of heavy fighting between insurgents and coalition forces .
It is not the first time US soldiers have intentionally killed Afghan civilians but the death toll is unprecedented for a single soldier .
The soldier , who the Nato - led coalition said was arrested after the assault , appears to have made no attempt to cover up the shootings .
Allen , in his statement , offered his regret and "" deepest condolences "" to the Afghan people and vowed that he will make sure that "" anyone who is found to have committed wrong - doing is held fully accountable "" . ""
This deeply appalling incident in no way represents the values of [ the International Security Assistance Force ] and coalition troops or the abiding respect we feel for the Afghan people , "" said Allen .
"" Nor does it impugn or diminish the spirit of cooperation and partnership we have worked so hard to foster with the Afghan National Security Forces . ""
Caitlin Hayden , a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council , said that President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting incident .
She said , "" we are deeply concerned by the initial reports of this incident , and are monitoring the situation closely . ""
Anti - foreigner sentiment is already running high in Afghanistan after US troops burned copies of the Qur'an and sparked days of deadly protests .
The burnings sparked violent protests and attacks that killed some 30 people .
Six US service members have been killed in attacks by their Afghan colleagues since the Qur'an burnings came to light .
Sunday 's killings risk rekindling that anger .
The coalition 's deputy commander , Adrian Bradshaw , acknowledged there had been deaths , although he did not give a number .
"" I can not explain the motivation behind such callous acts , but they were in no way part of authorised ISAF military activity , "" he said in a statement . ""
An investigation is already under way and every effort will be made to establish the facts and hold anyone responsible to account .
"" Photographers at the burials saw the bodies of at least 15 bodies riddled with bullets .
Halim put the death toll at 16 , with others who were injured receiving treatment in a Nato military hospital .
Halim and another man from the village , Haji Satar Khan , said four people from the family of Fahed Jan , and one child from another family died in addition to the 11 members of Wazir 's family .
The killings sparked a demonstration in the district , prompting the US embassy to warn residents and travellers in Kandahar to exercise caution .

2012-03-11,"Afghan President Hamid Karzai said on Sunday he would meet western demands to sign by May a much - delayed pact defining the country 's long - term relationship with the US , but the agreement may not initially establish the size or location of US forces remaining in Afghanistan .
Karzai was speaking at an event in Kabul before news reached the capital that a US soldier had shot dead 16 Afghan civilians , most of them women and children , on a night - time killing spree outside his base in southern Afghanistan .
In the speech to mark International Women 's Day , which fell on the Afghan weekend , he said the US and its allies would provide $ 4.1bn a year in support for Afghanistan 's security forces after their own combat forces leave in 2014 .
That figure has been tentatively agreed by Karzai and his backers as the cost of supporting the country 's army and police . ""
The $ 4.1bn is what is believed will be the annual cost of ANSF ( Afghan national security force ) sustainment post-2014 , "" said a western official , who declined to be named .
"" The Afghans have in fact pledged that GIRoA ( the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan ) will pay $ 500 m of that amount annually , with donor and coalition nations making up the rest . ""
Karzai recently reached a last - minute deal with the US military to hand over the sprawling Bagram prison to Afghan control , removing one of the key obstacles to agreeing a strategic partnership deal that has stalled for months .
US and Afghan officials will now move on to the other main block : controversial night - time operations to capture or kill insurgents .
Karzai has said they must end before Kabul will sign off on the strategic partnership , but western generals say the war is lost without them .
The west is keen to have a partnership in place before a Nato conference to be held in Chicago in May , expected to formally seal support for Afghanistan after 2014 .
A deal to keep forces in Afghanistan would allow western leaders to argue that the funding is not a one - way flow of cash but provides a critical benefits for their own national security .
"" We have agreed to sign the strategic pact before the Chicago summit , "" Karzai said .
However , the pact will not initially seal key issues such as agreement on bases the US can use in Afghanistan and how many troops will be stationed there .
"" Discussions about the use of Afghan military facilities … in Afghanistan will happen one year after the pact is signed , "" Karzai said ."
2012-03-15,"Another day , another body - blow in Afghanistan .
Except Thursday saw not one but two heavy diplomatic punches thumping into the solar plexus of the bruised and battered Nato coalition : a decision by the Taliban to boycott nascent peace talks ; and a demand by President Hamid Karzai that US , British and other coalition troops withdraw back to base .
How many more hits can the west 's Afghan strategy take before it finally gives up the ghost ?
The policy 's many critics , backed by sceptical public opinion in the US and Britain , say it is already dead and gone .
Seen this way , the Afghanistan talk - in featuring Barack Obama and David Cameron in Washington this week resembles a discussion between two undertakers about the most fitting way to dress a corpse .
The nub : how to get out fast – without appearing to get out fast .
For the Oval Office record , nothing will shake Obama 's 2014 timetable for handover and withdrawal .
About 23,000 US troops are due to leave by September , out of a total of 91,000 .
White House armchair colonels hint that this schedule may be speeded up , in defiance of Pentagon advice .
Defying the top brass has great appeal for Democrats in an election year .
But such tinkering aside , the policy 's basic planks remain unchanged .
Afghanistan was Obama 's war of choice .
He picked it in preference to Iraq , ordered a General Petraeus - patented surge , went after the bad guys and now , like Bush before him , is preparing to declare a victory , whatever the facts .
Yet just how long Obama and Cameron can hold this line is ever more open to question .
Writing in the New Yorker , Steve Coll suggested the policy was disintegrating under the weight of its own wrong assumptions – and would not last until 2014 .
"" The most glaring one is that Nato 's surge in 2009 could induce better governance
…
There are at least two other dubious assumptions .
One is that Afghan politics will be cohesive and stable enough in 2014 to bear the pressures of a dramatic reduction of foreign troops .
A second is that Afghan security forces will be capable and politically unified enough to take on the burden assigned to them , "" Coll said .
Coll argues that it is not too late for Obama to recognizse the policy is fatally flawed , and that to persist with it inflexibly is folly .
The US and Britain should consider , for example , paying greater attention to the broad political goals enunciated by Afghan leaders , and not just by Karzai . ""
These goals include an end to night raids , greater and faster sovereignty over international military operations , and a review of the arming and supervision of militias .
Even the announcement of such a direction might arrest the despair and contention that surrounds the American - Afghan partnership , bogged down for months in increasingly implausible negotiations over a strategic partnership accord . ""
For veteran reporter Sandy Gall , recent events pail into significance compared with what may happen when Nato leaves .
"" Afghans already feel that electoral considerations are more important to the west than the key question of whether the raw , new Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police will be up to the task of guaranteeing the country 's security , especially if Pakistan 's intelligence agency , the ISI , continues to back the Taliban , "" Gall said .
Civil war beckoned , he warned .
The Washington Post also said that humility , and a rethink , were badly needed lest Afghan policy definitively crash and burn . ""
Mr Obama and his aides have done much to damage the relationship between the two countries and public morale on both sides , "" it said .
Obama 's people had disrespected President Hamid Karzai and pursued talks with the Taliban over his head , unwisely overruled Pentagon advice , and let politics dictate strategy . ""
Afghans , the Taliban and neighbours such as Pakistan can reasonably conclude that the United States , rather than trying to win the war , is racing to implement an exit strategy in which the interests of Afghans and their government are slighted , "" it said .
In other words , in Afghanistan , it 's time to swallow pride and wise up , before it really is too late ."
2012-03-15,"The Taliban have suspended talks with the US , saying in a statement that they were presented with unacceptable demands .
The move leaves the west 's political strategy for Afghanistan in tatters days after a US soldier 's massacre of 16 civilians raised questions about the future of the military campaign .
Within minutes of the insurgents ' announcement , President Hamid Karzai delivered another blow to western plans by calling for US troops to leave Afghan villages immediately .
In a statement following a meeting with the US defence secretary , Leon Panetta , in Kabul , Karzai said he would like to see foreign efforts shift to economic assistance and reconstruction .
If that demand is met , it could spell the end for the current coalition military strategy of pushing out insurgents and winning over civilian populations village by village .
The Taliban 's decision last year to open an office in Qatar raised hopes that – after years of false starts and dead ends – there might be a real prospect of at least coming to the negotiating table with the insurgent group .
Hope of a decisive military victory over the Taliban has long been abandoned , so negotiations are a key part of western efforts to organise a withdrawal of combat troops in 2014 without allowing Afghanistan to slide back into civil war .
The statement did not go into the precise details of the US demands that prompted the Taliban to abandon talks , but it described Washington as "" shaky , erratic and vague "" and rejected any discussion with the government in Kabul as pointless .
"" They turned their backs on their promises and started initiating baseless propaganda portraying the envoys of the Islamic Emirate as having commenced multilateral negotiations for solving the Afghan dilemma , "" the statement said .
However it did leave open the possibility that dialogue could resume in the future . ""
The Islamic Emirate has decided to suspend all talks with Americans taking place in Qatar from today onwards until the Americans clarify their stance on the issues concerned , "" the Taliban said , using their own name for the insurgent movement , the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan .
The International Assistance Security Force said it was aware of Karzai 's statement and that it would continue to be discussed in diplomatic channels .
The US embassy could not immediately be reached for comment on either statement ."
2012-03-16,
2012-03-16,"The President of Afghanistan warned he was frustrated over western killings of civilians , as he accused the US of obstructing an Afghan investigation into the massacre of 16 civilians last Sunday .
At a meeting with the investigation team and family members of the victims , most of them women and children , Hamid Karzai asked the army chief of staff to investigate villagers ' claims that there was more than one attacker – contradicting the official US version of events .
He also confirmed a demand made on Thursday that foreign forces leave Afghan villages .
"" This has been going on for too long .
You have heard me before , therefore , it is by all means the end of the rope here , "" he said of the killings , which he described as the latest of "" hundreds "" of such incidents nationwide .
"" This form of activity , this behaviour , can not be tolerated .
"" he said .
Karzai has always been outspoken about civilian deaths at the hands of foreign troops .
But the latest broadside comes as his financial and military backers are grappling with the implosion of their strategy for Afghanistan .
His words are likely to put more strain on the relationship between Washington and Kabul that some feel is already in crisis .
His call for an investigation into whether more than one person was behind the massacre implies that he does not trust the US military or political hierarchy to tell the truth about the killings . ""
On the question of the account of the one person , supposedly , who has done this , the story of the village elders [ in the Panjwai district of southern Kandahar province ] and the affected people is entirely different .
They believe it is not possible for one person to do that , "" Karzai told journalists after the meeting .
Many people in Afghanistan believe the US staff sergeant detained over the shootings did not act alone .
"" When I saw my wife 's body , her hand had been cut off .
This was not the work of one person , "" a man from a family who lost 11 members told the meeting .
"" Helicopters were over the village … we have witnesses that saw it was more than one person , "" he added , although , like all those who testified , he did not personally witness the attack .
Western military officials have said helicopters were sent to pick up the injured .
Groups of soldiers seen later in the village were a search party sent out when the killer 's absence was noticed , they said , and surveillance video backed up the conclusion there was a single killer .
Karzai said his investigators did not find the US surveillance video they were shown convincing .
The army chief of staff reported to the meeting that a key US commander had not returned his calls while he was investigating the attack . ""
The Afghan investigation team did not receive the co - operation that they expected from the United States , therefore these are all questions that [ we ] will be raising , and raising very loudly and raising very clearly , "" Karzai said , referring to whether the killer acted alone .
Afghans were weary of killings by foreign troops after "" hundreds "" of civilian casualty incidents , he told the meeting , a point he underlined when he told US President Barack Obama in a morning phone call that his call for foreign forces to leave Afghan villages was serious .
Rural settlements are not centres of terrorism , he added ; the West should look instead to neighbouring countries , while Afghans could sort out their own disagreements .
The White House said later that during the conversation the two leaders "" agreed to further discuss concerns voiced by President Karzai about the presence of foreign troops in Afghan villages "" .
If troops retreat to major bases and end patrols , as Karzai has demanded , it would mean an end to the western military approach in Afghanistan .
Hopes of progress towards a political settlement were also dented by a Taliban announcement on Thursday that the group is suspending peace negotiations with the US .
Karzai and the Panjwai villagers also dismissed reports that before the shooting spree , the father of two had suffered some kind of breakdown .
The New York Times quoted an unnamed US official saying he may have "" snapped "" after drinking alcohol illicitly .
"" They said he was a madman , but how can a madman go out from headquarters ?
Why did n't he kill his friends there ? ""
one village elder , who did not give his name , asked Karzai .
The lawyer for the staff sergeant accused of the killings said he is a decorated survivor from three tours of duty in Iraq .
The Seattle attorney John Henry Browne said the soldier believed he would not return to a tour of duty before being sent to Afghanistan .
Originally from the US Midwest , the soldier had been injured twice in Iraq , and was loath to go to Afghanistan , Browne said .
The day before the killings , he witnessed a friend having his leg blown off .
The staff sergeant was due to arrive at a detention facility at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , last night from Kuwait ."
2012-03-19,"When the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , called for an investigation to determine whether a US soldier who massacred nine Afghan children and seven other civilians had acted alone , he was voicing a question on the lips of most Afghans .
The 38-year - old staff sergeant Robert Bales has been depicted as a mentally strained , "" rogue "" killer by US and Nato military officials , who have shown Afghan officials surveillance video of his solitary return to base among other evidence that he acted alone .
Among Afghans however there is a widespread belief that the soldier had companions , and perhaps official sanction , on his shooting rampage .
The implication that the US is lying about perhaps the worst military killings in Afghanistan reflects how far a decade of spiralling war has eroded trust between the Nato - led coalition and Afghans . ""
In four rooms people were killed , children and women were killed , and then they were all brought together in one room and then put on fire ; that one man can not do , "" Karzai told journalists , after hearing from a relative of the worst - affected family who survived because he was away that evening .
The scale of the massacre shocked the West , because although there have been far larger death tolls from air strikes , they have been accepted in foreign troops ' home countries as tragic mistakes .
But for many in Afghanistan , the shooting spree is just the latest in a string of tragic and unnecessary killings by soldiers who have lots of firepower and little accountability , and who usually move in groups .
"" This is not like past civilian casualty incidents .
This was n't a mistake in the heat of battle , the result of poor intelligence , or an indiscriminate reaction .
But in Afghan eyes it looks pretty much the same , "" said Erica Gaston , a human rights lawyer working on Afghanistan and Pakistan for the Open Society Institute .
The foreign military 's poor handling of other civilian deaths has made Afghans more likely to believe that there could be some kind of cover - up involved in the account of a lone , rogue gunman , she added .
"" The lack of meaningful public accountability and explanation of past civilian casualties incidents has led to a widespread – if unfair – perception that international military wantonly kill Afghans with impunity . ""
The massacre also came after a string of damaging revelations about US soldiers ' conduct in Afghanistan , that heavily undermined trust in their conduct and motives .
Last year a group were tried for murdering three Afghan civilians for sport , in January a video surfaced of marines apparently urinating on Taliban corpses , and deadly violence erupted in February over the burning of copies of the Quran by US troops .
"" I have encountered almost no Afghan who believes it could have been one person acting alone , whether they think it was a group or people back at the base somehow organising or facilitating it , "" said Kate Clark , of Afghanistan Analysts Network .
Rumours and conspiracy theories spread easily in Afghanistan , a country where internet is an elite luxury , and outside cities many people do not have electricity , much less television .
But a conviction the US is not telling the truth about the Panjwai killings – and their wider aims in Afghanistan – is not confined to the poor or illiterate . ""
The aim of the US in our country is to kill our people every day , and take our country under their control , "" said Mohammad Baqar Shaikhzada , a mullah and former Member of Parliament who now preaches at the Jafaryia mosque in the centre of Kabul and said he believes there were several gunmen .
"" It is the job of the people of Afghanistan to show a reaction against the people of America , and that reaction has to be jihad , "" Shaikhzada added .
Feeding suspicion , Karzai also complained the US is not collaborating with his investigative team , as lawmakers and many other Afghans demand a speedy trial and death by hanging for the killer .
But Washington 's ability to answer Afghan questions over the massacre , may be limited by its promises to bring him to justice through the complex and slow - moving US legal system .
Prosecutors in such a high - profile case are likely to be taking extreme caution to avoid any misstep that could allow defence lawyers to win Bale 's freedom on a technicality , rather than a court - room examination of his guilt .
"" I think the differences lie in part in the fact that it is vital that the US investigators conduct their investigation with regard for the due process rights of the suspect , "" said one US official who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the subject .
"" The United States wants justice as much as anyone in Afghanistan for this terrible act , which has horrified every American , however the premature release of evidence could ultimately undermine prosecutorial efforts . ""

2012-04-04,"Hamid Karzai is to set up a special prosecutors office and court to tackle a $ 900 m ( £ 567 m ) banking corruption scandal that threatened funding for his Afghan government , and has demanded all bad loans be repaid within two months .
Diplomats in Kabul were cautiously optimistic about the surprise announcement , which is the first sign for months of serious government action over the Kabul Bank scandal , a case that has become a benchmark for the Karzai administration 's willingness to tackle rampant corruption .
Detention terms have also been tightened on the two main suspects , the bank 's chairman , Sherkhan Farnood , and CEO , Khalilullah Ferozi , said a source with knowledge of the investigation .
They have officially been under house arrest , with leave to travel in order to identify and transfer assets , but have been seen around Kabul enjoying meals at high - end restaurants and gambling with friends , according to the New York Times .
Kabul Bank , which had ties to the family of Karzai and his first vice - president , nearly collapsed in 2010 and has since been described by western officials as a virtual Ponzi scheme .
An initial Afghan investigation found there was no paperwork on loans worth nearly $ 500 m .
Karzai 's announcement followed the completion of a months - long independent forensic audit that should give a much clearer idea of who is responsible for what portion of the missing money .
"" We look forward to seeing the results of these decisions , especially the return of assets stolen from Kabul Bank and prosecution of those responsible for the crisis , "" said a US official who declined to be named .
The plan was settled at a meeting packed with most of Afghanistan 's top economic and legal officials , including the head of the central bank and the attorney general , suggesting Karzai had marshalled the support of the country 's elite .
"" It was decided that a special prosecutors office and a special tribunal be set up at the earliest to conduct the investigation and bring to the table those who have illegally taken loans from Kabul Bank and who are involved in the bank 's financial crisis , "" the president 's office said in a statement .
Some western officials said the decisions to set up a special court rather than referring cases to the attorney general , and to set a two - month limit for loan returns , suggested political motives behind the move .
The outgoing British ambassador to Kabul , William Patey , said in an interview last month that Britain could withdraw funding for the Afghan security forces if the government fails to tackle rampant corruption , and described the handling of Kabul Bank as a "" litmus test "" . ""
Kabul Bank is so symbolic , because it 's two people [ Farnoon and Ferozi ] who have been caught red - handed , "" he said .
The announcement comes weeks before a Nato conference is expected to agree billions of dollars in long - term funding for Afghanistan 's security forces , and shortly before the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is due to check progress on tackling the scandal .
The IMF last year suspended millions of dollars of aid to Afghanistan because it was not satisfied with the government 's efforts , and could potentially do so again . ""
Progress on asset recovery related to Kabul Bank is one of the benchmarks for the upcoming first review of Afghanistan 's IMF programme , "" said the US official ."
2012-04-12,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has said he is considering stepping down a year early , potentially clearing the way for his successor to manage the departure of foreign troops from Afghanistan .
Presidential elections are due in 2014 , the same year western combat soldiers will complete their withdrawal .
Karzai said he was weighing up concerns that managing big changes in leadership and security at the same time could be too heavy a strain on his country , after a decade with him in charge and foreign troops on the ground .
"" I have been talking about this for some time now , and this is quite a good consideration , [ whether ] we can not have all of that accomplished in 2014 because of the heavy agenda , "" Karzai told a news conference in Kabul , held with the visiting Nato secretary general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen . ""
Should we allow the transition process to complete itself in 2014 , but bring the presidential election one year earlier to 2013 ?
"" he said .
He also raised the possibility of bringing the security handover forward .
Earlier this year he called for a speeded - up transition schedule .
Influential Afghans were last week questioning whether the election could go ahead on schedule , with talk of either delaying the vote or bringing it forward by a year .
The independent election commission said then it will not move the date , and no one else has the authority to do so , but if Karzai chose to resign it would probably precipitate a poll .
Named interim president in 2002 , Karzai won five - year terms in 2004 and 2009 and so is barred by the constitution from standing again .
He has repeatedly said he will not seek another term in office , but both Afghan rivals and western diplomats in Kabul have voiced concerns he may use worries about security and stability to extend his rule .
According to an influential member of the Kabul establishment , Karzai believes that if elections can not take place in 2014 , "" he will hang in there for a couple more years . ""
Even if Karzai does step down from the presidency in 2013 , he is unlikely to abandon politics entirely , one analyst and former official said .
"" I do n't think that he is ready to give up power in the near future , but he is thinking of a creative solution acceptable both to Afghans and the international community , "" said Davood Moradian , a political science professor at the American University of Afghanistan and former chief policy adviser to the Afghan foreign minister .
Moradian said some of Karzai 's advisers were attracted by the "" Putin model "" .
The Russian president , Vladimir Putin , stepped down as president after two terms , as required by his country 's constitution , but became a powerful prime minister and this year was re - elected as president ."
2012-04-16,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has blamed intelligence failures , especially by Nato , for an 18-hour siege of the capital , Kabul , and simultaneous attacks across eastern Afghanistan that the Taliban said they had rehearsed for months using mock - up buildings .
The rattle of gunfire and regular explosions kept Kabul on edge overnight on Sunday , as Apache attack helicopters strafed an unfinished high - rise commandeered by insurgents , and continued long after the morning call to prayer .
Thirty - six insurgents were killed in the co - ordinated assaults in the east , west and centre of the capital , and across three cities in eastern Afghanistan .
But the civilian toll from hours of fighting in urban centres across the east was relatively low , with four dead and several dozen more injured , according to Karzai , who praised Afghan security forces for the speed and bravery of their response .
The parliament building , US , German and British embassies , and some Nato military camps were among the high - profile and well - defended buildings targeted .
A Taliban spokesman said the group had carefully rehearsed for months , even building small military models and pre - positioning weapons in the high - rise building sites they used as bases .
"" Our military experts sketched maps of the targets and also created a mock - up of them where fighters carried out practice before carrying out the large - scale operations in four provinces , "" Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters news agency by phone .
Karzai described the attacks as an "" intelligence failure for us and especially Nato "" and has called for an investigation , his office said in a statement .
The criticism underlined divisions between Karzai and his backers .
The US defence department spokesman George Little said the Pentagon did not believe there had been an intelligence failure .
"" If we 're held to the standard to have to know precisely when and where each insurgent attack is going to occur , I think that 's an unfair standard , "" he told Reuters .
"" This is a war zone . ""
The attacks also raised questions about efforts to boost Afghanistan 's forces as foreign troops leave .
Afghan forces drew widespread praise for their handling of the attacks , but they are still heavily reliant on the west for military intelligence .
Fighting near the heart of Kabul 's diplomatic district began with an apparent diversionary attack .
As the militants drove up to their building site base in a SUV , one fighter jumped into the street and ran off to attack the heavily defended gate of the National Directorate of Security , according to Major Sayed Abdullah , an NDS commando who was at the gate .
He said the fighter was killed almost immediately , but the attack gave his comrades time to take up their positions .
After a grenade bounced without exploding , they rammed the building site gate open with their car .
There are strong suspicions that the fighters must have stashed weapons and other supplies in the building in preparation for the attack , because their ammunition held out so long , another intelligence official said .
Bullet casings were scattered throughout the building , and empty water bottles and empty cartons of cream lay near a grenade and a tangle of wires that soldiers warned could be a booby trap .
Hours after the attack ended , US troops with sniffer dogs checked the building for undetonated explosives , as security officials snapped pictures of the bodies and discussed the support the fighters must have received . ""
Look at their expensive snacks , "" said a police general , Khalil Momenzada , pointing at a half - eaten bag of cashews that lay next to shattered teacups and an upended thermos .
"" Of course someone must have helped them , prepared all these things for them . """
2012-04-19,"President Hamid Karzai has condemned pictures of US troops posing with the mangled remains of a suicide bomber and other insurgent corpses as inhumane and provocative , and called for a faster handover of control over security to Afghanistan 's forces to avoid similar incidents in future .
US military and civilian leaders attempted to douse the latest scandal involving American troops in Afghanistan by swiftly condemning the photographs , published by the Los Angeles Times , which said it had 16 other images it had not made public .
"" It is such a disgusting act to take photos with body parts and then share it with others , "" Karzai said in a statement from his office that warned previous "" similar incidents of odious nature "" had sparked an angry reaction among Afghans . ""
The president underlines that the only way to put an end to such painful experiences is through an accelerated and full transition of security responsibilities to Afghan forces , "" the statement said .
It did not address the presence of Afghan police officers , at least one of whom appeared to be posing for the camera , in one of the published photos .
Barack Obama on Wednesday demanded an investigation and for those responsible to be held accountable and the US defence secretary , Leon Panetta , made one of several apologies .
The Pentagon , which asked the LA Times not to publish the images , had said they could be used as Taliban propaganda to incite attacks on US targets .
The US newspaper said the soldier who supplied the photographs – on condition of anonymity – cited them as evidence that failures of leadership and discipline were risking troops ' safety .
The strongly worded and co - ordinated official US responses began even before the Times broke the story and reflected official sensitivity after other cases of misconduct in Afghanistan .
In January , marines were found to have filmed themselves urinating on Afghan corpses .
In February , the burning of Qur'ans at a US base triggered deadly riots .
Last month , a staff sergeant allegedly killed 17 civilians , mainly women and children .
Among Afghans in Kabul there was condemnation of the photographs for breaking moral codes , and concern they could be used to recruit insurgents , but little sense of the personal outrage following the Qur'an burnings and civilian deaths ."
2012-04-22,"Afghanistan and the United States have agreed the contents of a long - awaited deal to define their relationship after most foreign troops leave at the end of 2014 , although the document sidesteps some of the thorniest questions about the US military presence .
Negotiations on the strategic partnership deal have dragged on for over a year , initially held up by two demands from the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , that he said were critical to restoring national sovereignty :
Afghan control of jails and an end to night raids on Afghan homes .
Western officials argued for months that the first demand was not practical and the second could undermine the military effort , but they eventually agreed compromises on both .
The main US prison is now in the middle of a six - month handover , and Afghan forces have taken control of night raids , under two separate agreements signed within a month of each other , paving the way for the strategic partnership deal . ""
Today Afghanistan and the US initialled and locked the text of the strategic partnership agreement , "" said Karzai 's spokesman , Aimal Faizi .
"" This means the text is closed , and both sides will now review the document and do a final consultation .
In the US it will go to the houses of Congress and the president ; in Afghanistan the president will consult with national leaders plus both houses of parliament . ""
Both sides agreed to set aside difficult questions about long - term US access to military bases and the status of any US forces that do stay on in Afghanistan .
These issues will be negotiated in a separate deal some time before 2014 .
Washington and its allies wanted to have the US - Afghan strategic partnership agreed before May , when a Nato conference in Chicago is expected to pledge long - term help to Kabul with finances and military training .
By opening the way for a smaller but longer - term US presence in Afghanistan , the agreement would give western leaders a rationale for supporting Kabul after combat troops are withdrawn in 2014 .
It also aims to reassure Afghans that the west will not cut and run , and is critical to Afghanistan 's financial stability .
The World Bank forecasts the country will have a $ 7bn ( £ 4.4bn ) hole in its annual budget after 2014 .
"" We are expecting the signature some time before Chicago , although there is no date yet , "" Faizi said .
Earlier this week it looked as if the pact might have been thrown back into question when Karzai demanded that the US write a pledge for funding of the Afghan security forces into the document .
"" They are providing us with money , there is no doubt about that .
But they say they will not mention the amount in the agreement .
We say : give us less , but mention it in the agreement .
Give us less , but write it down , "" Karzai was reported by the Associated Press to have said in a speech in the capital commemorating a revered Afghan writer .
The international community has informally agreed to spend around $ 4bn a year supporting the Afghan police and army , with the bulk of that coming from the US , some from European allies and around $ 500 m a year from the Afghan budget .
Karzai said he wanted a written commitment of at least $ 2bn , rather than a verbal promise of a higher figure , but the deal does not contain any firm figures .
The US government was not available for comment ."
2012-04-22,"Relations between the US and Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , came under renewed strain after a senior Congressman highly critical of the Kabul government was barred from entering Afghanistan .
Congressman Dana Rohrabacher , Republican chairman of the House foreign affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigation , has been an outspoken opponent of Karzai .
Rohrabacher has engaged with other Afghan leaders about a more decentralised form of government for Afghanistan and called for a US investigation into alleged government corruption .
He had been leading a delegation to Afghanistan but was stopped in Dubai on Friday on his way to Kabul .
The other members of the delegation had visas for Afghanistan but Rohrabacher did not .
According to his press spokeswoman , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , personally intervened to convey a message from Karzai that the congressman would not be welcome and asking him not to continue to Kabul .
Rohrabacher was still in Dubai on Sunday but scheduled to depart on Monday .
Karzai has repeatedly infuriated the Obama administration with his sharp public criticism of the US , even as Washington spends billions of dollars on security and aid in Afghanistan .
Blocking entry to a member of Congress adds to the growing tally of incidents that have strained ties .
"" This does n't look great a month before Chicago , "" a senior diplomat in Kabul said .
Nato is due to hold discussions at the Chicago summit next month on future relations with Afghanistan , and the US and its allies are expected to seal an agreement for long - term funding of the Afghan police and army .
Tara Olivia Setmayer , communications director for Rohrabacher , said : "" Karzai told the state department he was not welcome and secretary Clinton personally conveyed that sentiment to Mr Rohrabacher and asked him not to continue on to Kabul with his fellow members .
Out of respect , he obliged . ""
Setmayer said Rohrabacher had been a vocal critic of government corruption and "" the US 's failed strategy of foisting a western - style democracy from a central government in Kabul .
He has advocated involving the former Northern Alliance factions in the government , much to the chagrin of Karzai . ""
Rohrabacher has been in discussion with Afghan leaders for several months about a less centralised form of government .
In January the Afghan foreign ministry criticised what they saw as interference by the congressman in Afghanistan 's domestic affairs , after a meeting with several opposition leaders in Berlin .
Rohrabacher has had a long and colourful association with Afghanistan dating back to the 1980s when he accompanied mujahideen forces fighting the Soviet Union .
He became personal friends with many of the commanders who , with the support of US forces , toppled the Taliban government .
Among them was Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dostum with whom Rohrabacher remains in dialogue , and whom the delegation met on Sunday ."
2012-05-13,"A former Taliban minister turned government peace negotiator has been shot dead while sitting in traffic in Kabul , overshadowing news of a security transfer designed to showcase Afghanistan 's ability to tackle the insurgency on its own .
The killing was a blow to President Hamid Karzai 's hopes of bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table as western troops head home rather than attempting to fight them into submission .
Arsala Rahmani was the second senior member of Karzai 's high peace council to be killed in less than a year , after a suicide bomber targeted the group 's head , Burhanuddin Rabbani , last year .
A white car pulled up next to Rahmani 's SUV in traffic at about 8.30am , his grandson Mohammad Wares told the Guardian .
A hand with a pistol reached out , and Rahmani 's bodyguard turned round to see Rahmani collapse , bleeding from the chest .
"" There was only one bullet .
They shot him through the small back window , "" Wares told the Guardian .
"" They took him to the hospital , but he passed away there .
"" The killer has not been caught , and the Taliban denied any role in the shooting , although the group has a standing threat against members of the high peace council .
It has said it will not negotiate with the government of Karzai , whom it has condemned as a "" puppet "" .
Diplomats said the Taliban had the most immediate motive for targeting someone who was a figurehead for government efforts to negotiate . ""
The obvious message is that there is no way of relating to the Taliban other than through their formal channels , the political committee and the leadership , "" said one senior diplomat .
"" I do n't think it 's because he 'd tried anything spectacular , I think it 's more that he is considered a traitor . ""
A deputy minister for education under the Taliban government , Rahmani wore thick horn - rimmed glasses that belied his sharp eye for political shifts .
He had served as prime minister under a previous government , and in recent years the septuagenarian 's black - dyed beard and black turban were a familiar sight at gatherings of the powerful or influential .
He was one of several former members of the Taliban who were removed from a UN blacklist in July 2011 , eliminating a travel ban and an assets freeze in a move seen as key to promoting the peace effort .
The Nato - led coalition fighting in Afghanistan said the assassination suggested the Taliban had little interest in negotiating an end to the war . ""
This attack is clear evidence that those who oppose the legitimate government of Afghanistan have absolutely no interest in supporting the peace process on any level but through murder , thuggery , and intimidation , "" the International Security Assistance Force said in a statement .
The killing came hours before Karzai announced the start of the third phase of a gradual security handover to the Afghan police and army , designed to pave the way for all foreign soldiers to return home by the end of 2014 .
The extension included challenging areas such as the city of Kandahar , once the Taliban 's main centre of power , and in theory puts the capitals of all Afghanistan 's provinces under the control of the national army and police .
The announcement was welcomed as a sign of progress by the army and police , which have been expanding rapidly and long struggled to deal with a host of problems ranging from rampant drug abuse to corruption and high levels of attrition .
Nato 's senior civilian representative in Afghanistan , Simon Gass , said : "" [ This ] has been enabled by the great strides made by the Afghan national security forces who have repeatedly shown their ability to maintain security . ""
It means that officially three - quarters of Afghans will live in areas controlled by their own security forces .
But the actual handover can take up to 18 months , making the transition as much aspiration as achievement . ""
The transition of security responsibility in a designated area is a process that only takes place when the [ Afghan forces ] have the capability to take the lead role in maintaining their own security and can adequately deal with security situations that may arise in these areas , "" the Nato - led coalition said .
"" The complete process of transition in an area can take 12 - 18 months . ""

2012-05-20,"Barack Obama pressed the Afghanistan leader Hamid Karzai at the Nato summit in Chicago on Sunday to engage with greater urgency in secret talks with the Taliban about a political settlement .
Obama also urged Karzai to implement electoral reforms to cut down in the 2014 presidential election the kind of corruption that tarnished Karzai 's re - election in 2009 .
The pair were speaking at the opening of a two - day Nato summit in Chicago aimed at drawing up detailed plans for the withdrawal of the US - led , 130,000-strong international force by the end of 2014 , and for a more modest presence beyond that date .
After their meeting , Karzai reaffirmed his support for a timetable , which requires the Afghan army to take over the lead in combat by the middle of next year .
Karzai added that he was "" very much looking forward to an end to the war "" and the day when Afghanistan would "" no longer be a burden on the world "" .
Obama said the Nato summit was about "" painting a vision , post-2014 , in which we have ended our combat role , the Afghan war as we understand it is over , but our commitment to friendship and partnership with Afghanistan continues . ""
He added : "" Both of us recognise that we still have a lot of work to do .
The loss of life continues in Afghanistan .
There will be hard days ahead , but we 're confident that we 're on the right track . ""
Public weariness with the war has grown in the US and in other countries among the 50-strong international coalition .
Almost all international forces are scheduled to be out by the end of 2014 after helping to maintain security for the presidential elections that year .
Karzai has said he will not be standing again .
The Obama administration had hoped Chicago would be the venue for a major announcement of a political settlement with the Taliban .
But these hopes crumbled when the Taliban walked away from reconciliation talks in March .
Secret talks have since been resumed , according to US officials .
But Karzai , facing internal political opposition to the idea of reconciliation , has been reluctant to reach a deal .
Obama flew to Chicago on Saturday night after 24 hours of negotiation with the leaders of the G8 at the presidential retreat Camp David which was dominated by the euro - zone crisis but also addressed issues such as Afghanistan .
As well as pressing Karzai on a political settlement , Obama is having to focus on keeping the international force together , with some countries already preparing to leave early .
The new French president , François Hollande , is standing by a pledge to end French involvement in combat operations at the end of this year .
But he has offered a compromise that would see many of the troops remain in Afghanistan beyond that date in other roles .
The head of Nato , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , promised on Sunday that the French decision would not precipitate a sudden exodus by other countries .
"" There will be no rush for the exits , "" Rasmussen said .
"" Our goal , our strategy , our timetable remain unchanged . ""
Rasmussen predicted a compromise would be reached that will see France move into a non - combat role in support of the international mission .
After the 2014 pullout , a Nato force will be left behind , in part to help with training .
No figure has yet been announced but US commanders in Kabul have spoken of around 15,000 - 20,000 personnel .
Announcements about contributions from Nato countries towards the $ 4.1bn needed to finance that force for ten years are to be made at the Nato summit .
Among the contributions , Britain is promising to provide $ 110 m a year , Germany $ 200 m and Australia $ 100 m .
The US is to take up the bulk of the costs , anything from between 50 % and 75 % .
Obama is also planning to speak on the sidelines of the Nato summit with the Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari .
The US and Pakistan are engaged in negotiations about re - opening a supply route to Afghanistan through Pakistan closed in protest over the killing of Pakistan troops in a US air strike .
The White House national security spokesman Ben Rhodes , briefing reporters on a flight to Chicago , predicted the issue of the border closure would be resolved soon .
Although the US - led forces are able to transport supplies though alternative routes from the north of Afghanistan , it is more expensive .
"" On the supply lines , we believe that this is going to be resolved .
There have been positive steps , statements made by the Pakistanis , and we 're currently negotiating the opening of the supply lines with them ; we expect that to take some time .
So there is still work to be done through those negotiations , "" Rhodes said .
"" We 're not anticipating necessarily closing out those negotiations this weekend . """

He continued : "" A lot of it is happening , frankly , at the working level between our governments .
We 'll obviously keep you updated , but it 's our sense that both sides want to get it done , it will get done .
But right now , we 're in a process of negotiation about how exactly that 's going to happen . ""
Rhodes said Obama had not been briefed about the arrest of three activists alleged to have been planning to throw molotov cocktails at Obama 's campaign headquarters in Chicago as well as the home of Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel .
"" We 're very confident in the ability of Chicago , together with the United States government , to have a very successful event over the course of the next two days .
"" If these more serious allegations are true , then I think it was effective work in making sure that they could n't pose any additional threat to public security , "" Rhodes said ."
2012-05-26,"A brain drain of bright young women is already taking place in Afghanistan before the 2014 handover that many fear will mean a reversal of advances in women 's rights .
The lack of commitment by the Afghan government to equality and to tackling the high rates of ill - treatment of women in the home and in the workplace is raising real fears they will be at the bottom of the political agenda in the push for power after Nato forces leave the country .
Worsening security for civilians – casualties among ordinary Afghans have risen year on year for the last five years with 3,021 killed in 2011 , and women are thought to be suffering disproportionately – has led to rising numbers of women and girls leaving education and the workforce and staying indoors , according to Guhramaana Kakar , a gender adviser to President Hamid Karzai .
Speaking to the Observer , Kakar said negotiations between the government and the Taliban and other insurgent groups were ignoring women 's rights .
A recent survey by charity ActionAid suggested 86 % of Afghan women were fearful of a return to Taliban - style rule .
One in five worried about the education of their daughters but 72 % said their lives were better now than a decade ago .
"" Women do want the progress that has been made over the past 10 years to continue , but they are being kept away from the political processes , "" Kakar said .
"" All Afghans , men and women , want a country without foreign troops , but I think the international community should be putting women on the agenda and making sure their security and freedoms are secured , directly and indirectly . ""
She criticised the recent Nato conference in Chicago for completely ignoring the issue .
"" Women are regularly harassed in the workplace , they are exploited and credit for their achievements taken by men , while also being targeted by insurgents for going to work or school .
They suffer the worst in the security situation and , even at home , they are subjected to violence and abuse which is tacitly sanctioned by the courts and the government . ""
Kakar has been involved in peace negotiations with the Taliban and believes more women should be allowed into the political system .
"" We have many women in parliament but they are given very weak roles .
We have very brave women who are gaining respect and in some cases are trusted more than the men to negotiate , because they are seen as having less political baggage . ""
If more women were allowed into the provincial and peace councils , this would be a big show to the insurgents that they can not reverse 10 years of women 's advancements .
"" Growing levels of violence against women and a disregard by many courts for their legal protection has led to horrific stories of children being raped and then imprisoned for adultery , and schoolteachers being attacked for teaching girls .
ActionAid 's head of public affairs , Melanie Ward , said the security situation was an enormous threat to women .
""
Experience tells us that an increase in attacks on women is often an early warning sign that the Taliban is regaining control in an area . ""
"" Security for women can not be divorced from the wider security agenda in Afghanistan . ""
Selay Ghaffar , chief executive of the Kabul - based NGO Humanitarian Assistance for the Women and Children of Afghanistan , says many young women are leaving .
"" They see no future for themselves in Afghanistan so the bright ones are seeking scholarships or work abroad .
We have had two schools for girls burned down near the capital in recent days , acid attacks on girls going to school , increasing stories of rape and of kidnap . ""
Many NGOs who try to help women have been killed .
Billions of dollars from international organisations have been poured into Afghanistan and ended up in the pockets of male politicians , while women are left to feel insecure in their own land .
For those who can not leave , it is sending them back into the home ; many women are deciding to stop work . ""
During the first few years after international troops entered the country a lot of things changed in Afghanistan , "" she said .
"" There was positive progress and change in the day - to - day lives of many Afghan women .
Unfortunately , since 2007 , things changed dramatically as insecurity has increased [ and ] discrimination against women at all levels has increased .
Life has become more difficult for women but they are not willing to be pushed back into the box .
"" Why should all the plans for the future of Afghanistan ignore half of its population ? """
2012-05-27,"A Nato air strike has killed eight members of one family at their home in a part of eastern Afghanistan that has seen heavy fighting this year , officials say .
President Hamid Karzai sent a team to look into the strike , which local officials said they had not been informed about .
"" There was no co - ordination , [ Nato ] did n't seek the help of Afghan forces , "" said Rohullah Samoon , spokesman for the governor of Paktia province .
He added that he was sure that Mohammad Shafi , the head of the family , was not linked to the insurgency .
The Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) said troops fighting in the area on Saturday had called for support from planes or helicopters , but only after the Taliban launched an assault on them .
Justin Brockhoff , a spokesman for Isaf , said on Sunday : "" According to our initial operation reports , Afghan and Isaf troops were attacked by a large group of insurgents in southern Paktia .
The troops responded to the attack by returning fire , and requested close air support . ""
Karzai has long criticised Nato for not doing enough to prevent the killings of innocent civilians , which have become a major irritant in relations with his foreign partners .
He warned earlier this month that the deaths could undermine a deal laying the framework for ties with the US after 2014 , when most foreign combat forces will have left Afghanistan . ""
If the lives of Afghan people are not safe , the signing of the strategic partnership has no meaning , "" the Associated Press quoted Karzai 's office as saying .
Last year was the deadliest on record for Afghan civilians , according to UN statistics , with more than 3,000 killed in insurgency - linked violence .
The UN estimated the Taliban were responsible for over three - quarters of these deaths , but the insurgents are less often the target of Afghan public anger over civilian casualties .
Meanwhile , a British soldier was killed on Saturday by an explosion in the Nahr - e Saraj region of southern Helmand province , the Ministry of Defence said .
Three other foreign soldiers were killed by homemade bombs in other parts of southern Afghanistan on the same day , Nato said in a statement , but did not release their nationalities .
There have been 166 foreign troop deaths in Afghanistan this year ."
2012-06-06,"The man who has been nominated as Afghanistan 's new ambassador to the UK has been accused in the US of fraud and appears to have landed the job thanks to his contacts with Hamid Karzai 's powerful family .
Mohammad Daud Yaar is at present director of economic affairs at the foreign ministry in Kabul , and a key conduit between the Afghan government and donor agencies and embassies .
In 2010 a family of Afghan immigrants accused Yaar , in a civil court in California , of defrauding them .
He admits to owing them $ 100,000 .
Officials in Kabul have confirmed that Yaar has been nominated as the ambassador to London .
He has yet to take up his post .
The Foreign Office says it is unclear when he will arrive and adds that he is not ambassador yet .
Yaar denies fraud and says he intends to repay the money .
Afghan sources said Yaar secured the UK job following intense behind - the - scenes lobbying by Mahmoud Karzai , the president 's influential brother , whose business activities in Afghanistan are also being investigated in the US .
Yaar spent about 20 years in the US .
He lived with Ahmed Wali Karzai ( a brother who was killed ) in the late 1980s and 90s , when the family ran a restaurant in Chicago .
Ahmed Wali shared the business with Mahmoud and another Karzai brother , Qayum .
Yaar 's appointment to the high - profile London post is likely to raise questions about alleged rampant corruption and nepotism at the heart of the Karzai administration .
Ahead of the Afghan president 's departure from office in 2014 , family members have been fighting among themselves for control of the fortune they have amassed over the past decade , the New York Times reported this week .
The feuding within the Afghan elite has intensified as the 2014 deadline for the withdrawal of US , British and Nato troops draws nearer .
There are fears in Kabul that once the soldiers are gone , and if the west 's financial and military support drops off , the country could slip back into civil war .
Many people who have grown rich in Afghanistan are looking for a safe haven abroad for their assets , and often for their families as well .
Yaar returned to the country in 2009 .
He left the US following the settlement of a civil action against him .
The plaintiffs , two Afghan - born brothers , Jamal and Ajmal Staneckzai , claim he "" tricked , defrauded and deceived "" them over the 2001 purchase of a house in Fresno , California .
Yaar insisted the case , from California 's superior court in Contra Costa , was a business deal gone wrong .
He vehemently denied fraud .
"" If I had committed fraud , why did they settle ? "" he told the Guardian in his office in a low - rise building inside the sprawling grounds of the Afghan foreign ministry .
He added : "" It was a business agreement and the other side backed off [ from their side of the deal ] and went to the courts .
They could n't prove anything . ""
Yaar said he was planning to pay off the remainder of the money he owed as soon as he could afford it , but his home in California was in negative equity and his small government salary in Kabul did not leave room for savings .
He stressed : "" My intention was to help these guys to solve their housing problem . ""
But one of his alleged victims said that Yaar was not a fit person to become ambassador to the UK , let alone hold responsibility in Kabul for big financial issues .
Speaking by phone , Jamal Staneckzai told the Guardian he had wanted to buy a home for his elderly parents , Ghani and Amani , who fled Afghanistan in the 1980s during the Soviet occupation .
Unable to get a mortgage , he and four other families from the close - knit Afghan community in California turned to Yaar for help .
Yaar bought a property in 2001 on their behalf , but registered it in his own name .
The Staneckzais made regular mortgage payments , with several family friends providing the initial deposit as a loan , he said .
In 2005 the Staneckzais were finally able to get a mortgage .
When they asked Yaar to transfer the property to them he refused and sold it to them for $ 358,900 , promising to refund the net proceeds .
Instead , Yaar pocketed the cash , Staneckzai alleges "" I was a part - time student at university back in 2001 , which is why I could n't get a loan .
We regarded Yaar as a close and respected uncle .
He told us , "" you guys will pay the mortgage costs and I will transfer everything back to you "" .
Instead he took every dollar from us .
He took our equity . ""
In January 2009 the family 's lawyer , Bashir Ghazialam , filed court papers alleging "" breach of trust , breach of fiduciary duty and fraud "" .
In August 2010 he obtained a judgment against Yaar and his wife , Sadia , for $ 120,000 , after the Yaars paid only $ 10,000 of agreed damages .
Asked about the case Ghazialam said caustically : "" If this guy becomes ambassador to the UK
I might as well give up my law licence .
""
In Kabul , Yaar denied that the Staneckzais had provided money for the deposit , even though the court claims give details of family friends who say they provided the cash .
One friend is Khodaidad Karzai , one of the president 's uncles , whom , the Staneckzais say , lent them $ 5000 .
Yaar , however , insisted he paid the deposit himself .
Educated , clever , and a fluent English speaker , Yaar has a colourful biography .
After graduating he taught economics in Kabul for several years .
He fled the country in 1978 after the Soviet - backed government broke up an underground opposition group that he belonged to and which was centred on the university .
The group 's members agreed to write letters to foreign newspapers under fake names exposing the atrocities of the Afghan communist regime and its Soviet backers in Moscow .
Surviving members of the group said Yaar was the only one to escape .
They suspect they might have been betrayed by a mysterious relative whom Yaar brought to a meeting the day before the arrests began .
"" We were holding a meeting in July , and Daud Yaar came and brought a strange man we did n't know .
That evening we went to jail , "" said one surviving member of the group , who asked not to be named .
"" My view is that [ the man ] was a spy for the communist government .
I was a prisoner for a year and a half .
They tortured us and we came close to being hanged . ""
Yaar said his relative was also later arrested and badly tortured , adding : "" I do n't believe that he would give me or the others to the military . ""
Yaar spent 10 years in Germany before moving in 1987 to the US , where he shared a house with the Karzais .
Some sources said he worked before 9/11 as an informal PR adviser to the Taliban 's New York representative , Hakim Mujahid .
Yaar dismisses this .
Of the Taliban , he said : "" I think they deceived everybody –
they deceived the king , Professor Rabbani .
They said they were going to disarm the country but it turned out they were just a bunch of crooks and terrorists . ""
In California he worked as a part - time economics professor while amassing a property empire that included at least six houses .
Back in Kabul his connections got him a post on the Afghan National Security Council , chaired by Hamid Karzai .
He was a key liaison between the council and a UK - funded agency , Adam Smith International .
In 2010 Yaar became the director of economic affairs at the Kabul foreign ministry , a plum job .
He now liaises between the Afghan government and western donors on financial issues .
British diplomats in Kabul appear unaware of the fraud allegations and have declined to comment .
The appointment follows a year in which the key London post lay vacant as the Afghan government struggled to find a consensus candidate for what is considered one of the most senior and prestigious diplomatic posts .
At one point Yaar was in the frame to become ambassador in Washington .
The job eventually went to the deputy foreign minister Eklil Hakimi .
Yaar then got London as a consolation prize , one source suggested .
His predecessor in the UK , Homayoun Tanda , struggled to make his mark .
US diplomats who met him in 2009 noted that Tanda knew French fluently but could speak only "" broken , heavily accented English "" and that he "" struggled "" to communicate .
This made it difficult for the Afghan government get its message across to British officials and the media , the US mission in London noted ."
2012-06-09,"The Afghan government has hit out at the US for failing to consult with local forces ahead of an airstrike that killed 18 civilians , suggesting future such raids would be viewed as a breach of its pact with Washington .
An investigation into Wednesday 's night - time raid found that it was the result of "" a one - sided decision , and not co - ordinated with Afghan security forces "" , President Hamid Karzai 's spokesman Aimal Faiz said .
He went on to suggest that a repeat of the unilateral strike would be seen as a violation of a pact between the two countries over who takes the lead in "" special operations "" in the country .
Signed in April , the agreement puts the Afghan government in charge of such manoeuvres – a move designed to resolve some of the longstanding tensions between the two countries .
The fallout from the deadly strike – alongside news Saturday that four French soldiers in Afghanistan were killed by a suicide bomber wearing a burqa – have reaffirmed fears that Nato 's exit strategy will be far from orderly .
As part of the transition of power , more agreements are expected to be signed handing responsibility for security matters to Afghan forces .
But investigators looking into the circumstances surrounding the latest loss of civilian life in an airborne attack concluded that the call was made by US authorities alone .
Wednesday 's raid took place at a village in the Logar province in which militants were believed to be hiding .
US military officials have said such attacks are key in capturing or killing Taliban fighters .
But they have been resisted in Afghanistan , leading to a rift between Karzai and Washington .
Faizi said on Saturday that investigators told the president Afghan forces had surrounded the house prior to the airstrike .
But the US troops decided not to wait for them to try and flush out the militants , opting instead for aerial bombardment .
It was only later that they discovered that women , children and old men were inside the house .
On Friday , the senior American commander in Afghanistan apologised over the incident .
After flying to Logar province , Marine Gen John Allen promised to "" do the right things by the families "" of the bereaved .
A Nato investigation ruled that coalition forces were responsible for the killings , but made no mention of a violation of the special operations agreement , to the anger of Afghan officials .
"" This airstrike was a one - sided decision , and not coordinated with Afghan security forces , "" Faizi said .
He added that in the future , the Afghan government would consider such actions as a breach of the special operations pact .
The spokesman said : "" The continuation of uncoordinated operations and civilian casualties are against the recent decisions made between Afghanistan and the United States . ""
The Afghan government felt betrayed by the US , he said , adding : "" The expectation of the Afghan government and the Afghan people was that a new page would open between Afghanistan and the United States . ""
A Nato spokesman declined to comment on the Afghan findings ."
2012-06-10,"The US has vowed not to launch future air strikes in residential areas in Afghanistan , President Hamid Karzai has said , following the death of 18 civilians in a raid last week .
Speaking after a meeting with US ambassador Ryan Crocker and Nato commander General John Allen , Karzai said he had been given a "" commitment "" that American forces would cease bombing such targets .
It follows widespread anger in Afghanistan over a raid on Wednesday that killed women , children and elderly people in a home that US forces believed was harbouring a Taliban militant .
The Afghan government has hit out angrily at Nato over the raid , saying that it it violated a pact Kabul had with Washington over who would take the lead in "" special operations "" .
An inquiry into Wednesday 's attack in Lognar province found that it was the result of "" a one - sided decision , and not co - ordinated with Afghan security forces "" , President Karzai 's spokesman Aimal Faiz said on Saturday .
Investigators told Karzai that Afghan forces had surrounded the house prior to the American air strike .
But US troops decided not to wait for them to try and flush out the alleged militant , opting instead for aerial bombardment .
It was only later that they discovered that civilians were inside the house .
Nato initially said it had come under fire first , leading to the call for an air strike .
But the deaths of civilians has angered many within Afghanistan and strained already fragile relations between Washington and Kabul "" If the bombings on Afghan homes continue , they will be regarded as a violation and an act of aggression , "" Faizi said following the strike .
On Friday , Allen , the senior American commander in Afghanistan , apologised over the incident .
He did so again on Saturday after being summoned – along with Crocker – to a meeting with Karzai . ""
The Nato commander once again officially apologised about the civilian casualties in Baraki Barak district of Logar , "" according to a subsequent statement from the Afghan president 's office .
It added that Allen also agreed that the raid violated an agreement with Kabul in both "" text and spirit "" .
Signed in April , the agreement puts the Afghan government in charge of special operations in the country - a move designed to resolve some of the longstanding tensions between the two countries .
The unilateral decision behind Wednesday 's strike breached that understanding , Afghan officials have said .
Allen "" gave a commitment that his forces will not launch air strikes in residential areas "" Karzai 's office said .
The fallout from the deadly strike – alongside news Saturday that four French soldiers in Afghanistan were killed by a suicide bomber wearing a burqa – have reaffirmed fears that Nato 's exit strategy will be far from orderly .
Nato is committed to a military drawdown programme that will see troops leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 .
As part of that process , more agreements such as the one that the US is alleged to have violated on Wednesday are expected to be signed , handing greater responsibility for security to home - grown forces ."
2012-07-18,"David Cameron has landed in Afghanistan amid tight security to pay a visit to British troops in Helmand province as many of their colleagues embark on Olympics guard duties back in Britain .
A strict news blackout on the trip was partially broken when Hamid Karzai , the president of Afghanistan , announced on Tuesday that the prime minister would be visiting his country .
Cameron flew into Camp Bastion , the main British base in Helmand Province , after an overnight flight on an RAF C17 Globemaster military transporter from Britain .
The blackout was lifted early on Wednesday afternoon –
6.00pm local time – after the prime minister had spent the day visiting troops at Camp Bastion and at forward operating base further south .
The prime minister said he was confident that Britain remains on track to withdraw all combat troops by the end of 2014 because the process of handing control to Afghan forces was successfully under way .
Britain is to withdraw 500 troops by the end of this year , taking total troops numbers to 9,000 .
The prime minister said he would make an announcement by the end of this year on further troops withdrawal in 2013 .
He said : "" We need to consult very carefully with military commanders to look very carefully at how you go from where we are now to where we need to be in 2014 .
I have said before I do n't want to see a cliff edge .
But I am absolutely convinced there will be opportunities to reduce troop numbers next year .
"" There is a balance you have to strike .
On the one hand we want to support , mentor and partner our Afghan partners .
But on the other hand we need to help them stand on their own two feet .
The impression I am getting is they are stepping up to the plate and performing increasingly well .
"" There is a balance between staying on and supporting and pushing them forward to do more work themselves and getting the timelines right between now and 2014 .
I am convinced it is doable , it is deliverable .
It needs careful , patient work to get it right . ""
The prime minister makes a point of visiting British troops stationed in Helmand province at least twice a year , usually just after parliament rises for the summer and Christmas recesses .
Morale among some troops is said to be low after they returned home from Helmand only to discover they were needed for Olympics duties .
None of the troops seen by the prime minister in Afghanistan are likely to be called up for the Olympics .
On this visit Cameron will be assessing progress in handing over security duties to the Afghan national army ahead of the ending of all Nato combat missions by the end of 2014 .
All areas under British command since troops were deployed to Helmand in 2006 are in transition to Afghan control .
In May this year Karzai announced the third tranche of transition , which will include the Helmand district of Nahri Sarraj .
This followed an operation last December when more than 280 British forces joined up with 550 Afghan troops in Operation Winter Success to clear Taliban forces from the area where three Helmand provinces meet — Nad Ali , Lashkar Gah and Nahri Sarraj .
Nato forces started to hand over security to Afghan forces in Lashkar Gah in July last year in the first tranche .
The second tranche began in Nad Ali last November .
Government sources said Cameron understood that the last 30 months before the final withdrawal of all Nato combat troops would not be easy .
"" There is still a challenge in tackling the insurgency , "" one source said .
The threat to British troops , often from Afghan forces , was highlighted earlier this month when three British soldiers were killed by an Afghan policeman in a "" green on blue "" attack at the Kamparack Pul compound in Helmand .
The prime minister will tread carefully on negotiating with the Taliban .
Britain 's official position is that talks can only open with the Taliban if it renounces violence and signs up to Karzai 's political process .
Unofficially , Britain 's position was recently expressed by David Miliband , the former foreign secretary , who spoke of the "" need for and difficulties in "" embarking on "" serious discussion with the Taliban about the future of Afghanistan "" .
Miliband 's remarks were made in a special edition of the New Statesman the former foreign secretary guest edited .
This included an interview with one of the Taliban 's most senior commanders by the former UN envoy Michael Semple .
The Taliban commander told Semple the insurgents acknowledged the need to seek a settlement in Afghanistan because they could not win a war , and capturing Kabul remained a "" very distant prospect "" .
The commander was dismissive of Karzai and said the only forces of consequence in Afghanistan were the Americans and the Northern Alliance .
The Taliban sent representatives earlier this year to Qatar as a first step towards negotiations with the US .
But the talks stalled amid annoyance from Karzai that he had been excluded .
Cameron has had a mixed experience on visits to Afghanistan .
A visit to Camp Bastion last December had to be aborted when a sandstorm forced his plane to divert to Kandahar .
In July 2010 the prime minister had to abort a visit to a forward operation base in southern Helmand after the military intercepted intelligence which suggested that the Taliban were planning to attack a high - profile visitor .
This led to a review of the arrangements for the prime minister 's visits to Afghanistan ."
2012-07-19,"David Cameron will break new ground on Thursday when he holds a joint meeting in Kabul with the Afghan president Hamid Karzai and the new Pakistani prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf .
Downing Street believes the meeting , the diplomatic highlight of the prime minister 's second day in Afghanistan , will show the importance Britain attaches to the "" Af - Pak "" strategy .
This is the phrase coined by Barack Obama to denote the significance of treating Afghanistan and Pakistan as equally important – and linked – challenges .
British officials see the meeting as a rare chance for Cameron to assess the joint commitment of Afghan and Pakistani leaders to dealing with the insurgent threat which straddles their borders .
Nato forces are handing over control of Afghan security to local forces to ensure that all combat troops are withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2014 .
One source said : "" It is an important meeting .
It is an opportunity for the three leaders to talk .
But it is important not to over - play the outcome .
This is a good chance .
It is a good opportunity to talk about how they can work together . ""
Britain wants to encourage greater co - operation between Afghanistan and Pakistan as they confront the "" circle of violence "" which comprises the Taliban and the Pakistani - based insurgent Haqqani network .
Relations are often strained between the two countries because Pakistan 's ISI intelligence service encouraged the Taliban in the 1990s as a way of strengthening Islamabad 's influence in Afghanistan .
One source said : "" It is in the interests of Afghanistan and its neighbours that there is a secure and stable Afghanistan .
That is in their mutual interests . ""
Cameron will adopt a cautious approach to his new Pakistani counterpart .
There are concerns about the way in which Ashraf was installed after his predecessor , Yousuf Raza Gillani , was recently disqualified from office .
The prime minister will make clear in his talks with Karzai that Britain will maintain a significant security and diplomatic presence in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of all Nato combat troops at the end of 2014 .
Britain is taking a leading role in helping to establish an officer training staff college in Kabul .
Karzai let slip details of the prime minister 's trip on Tuesday when he mentioned Britain 's role in helping to create an Afghan national officer academy .
"" We are going to sign the agreement for a training centre the British are going to make for our forces , "" Karzai said .
He added Britain 's involvement in India highlighted its strength in training overseas armies ."
2012-07-19,"David Cameron has warned the Taliban it would be a grave mistake to believe insurgent forces can destabilise Afghanistan by mounting a major offensive when Nato ends combat operations in 2014 .
Amid concerns among senior British military figures that the government may withdraw troops too quickly , the prime minister said the Taliban should "" be in no doubt "" about the ability of Afghan forces to confront the insurgency .
But the prime minister , who was speaking at a press conference with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , in Kabul , said the Taliban would be welcome to join the political process if it renounced violence .
Britain and other Nato countries are to withdraw all their combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014 .
A process to hand over security to Afghan forces in stages was agreed at a Nato summit in Chicago earlier this summer .
The summit was followed by a major donors ' conference in Tokyo .
The prime minister said to Karzai : "" Over the last three months , the international community has made clear our commitment to securing Afghanistan 's future and prosperity for decades to come .
We want to work with you to transform the future together . ""
In remarks aimed at the Taliban , the prime minister said : "" I think this sends a very clear message to the Taliban : you can not wait this out till foreign forces leave in 2014 because we will be firm friends and supporters of Afghanistan long beyond then . ""
Cameron added : "" What I would say to the Taliban is be in no doubt there is a very clear and strong plan to transfer lead security responsibility from very capable Isaf [ International Security and Assistant Force ] forces , including British forces , to very capable Afghan forces .
"" I am content that they will be able to defeat an insurgency .
Of course , we would make even further political progress if there were successful political talks and if the insurgency was to come to an end in that way .
But the Taliban should be in no doubt that we will be handing to a very capable , very large , well - equipped Afghan army , security forces , local police . ""
The prime minister signalled Britain 's continuing commitment to Afghanistan after 2014 by signing an agreement in the grounds of the presidential palace for a "" Sandhurst in the sand "" officer training camp in Kabul .
This will involve 90 members of the British army who will mentor Afghan forces .
Karzai praised Cameron as a longstanding friend of Afghanistan .
But Britain has privately been irritated that Karzai has stalled peace talks with the Taliban .
Tentative discussions in Qatar involving the Americans ran into trouble after Karzai indicated he had been excluded .
The prime minister showed the need for dialogue when he said : "" So now is the time for everyone to participate in a peaceful political process in Afghanistan .
All those who renounce violence , who respect the constitution , can choose to have a voice in the future prosperity of this country rather than continuing in fighting to destroy it .
"" There are fighters who are leaving the battlefield who are giving up their fighting and who want to be part of a successful future Afghanistan . ""
Karzai insisted he was committed to reconciliation . ""
The peace process is the most important of our pursuits for Afghanistan it remains the highest priority . ""
The prime minister highlighted another British concern – the need for improved relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan – by pressing for a joint meeting in Kabul on Thursday with Karzai and the new Pakistani prime minister , Raja Pervaiz Ashraf .
Downing Street saw the meeting as an important way to encourage the neighbours to work together on countering the various insurgencies and to promote dialogue .
But the prime minister made clear more needed to be done .
"" That [ peace ] plan would be improved by further political discussions , by better co - operation between Afghanistan and Pakistan , but it is not dependent on those things . """
2012-07-19,"David Cameron has delivered a blunt warning to the Syrian president , Bashar al - Assad , that he must leave power immediately or watch his country descend into civil war .
In some of the first remarks by a western leader after the assassination of members of the Assad inner circle in Damascus , the prime minister said a lack of change at the top would lead to revolution from the bottom in Syria .
The prime minister , who was speaking at a press conference in Kabul with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , also urged Russia to "" step up to the plate "" and stop vetoing UN sanctions against Assad .
Asked what his message was to Assad after the escalation of violence in Syria , the prime minister said : "" I would have a very clear message for President Assad : it is time for him to go .
It is time for transition in this regime .
Clearly Britain does not support violence on either side .
But if there is n't transition , it is quite clear there is going to be civil war .
That is the clear fact we can all see on the ground . ""
The regime has done some truly dreadful things to its own people .
I do n't think any regime that carries out acts as they have against their own citizens , and continues to do so , should survive .
That regime should go . ""
Cameron highlighted British and EU impatience with Vladimir Putin , who has vetoed a series of proposed UN security council resolutions that would have imposed tough sanctions on Syria .
Russia has been joined by China , one of five permanent members of the UN security council which have the power of veto .
Britain , the US and France also have vetoes .
Cameron said : "" The message to President Putin and to all those on the UN security council is : it is time for the UN security council to pass clear and tough messages about sanctions –
I believe under chapter seven of the UN – and to be unambiguous in this . ""
Obviously we are a UN security council with permanent members and permanent members that have vetoes .
We ca n't pass these things without everybody stepping up to the plate and taking the right action .
But I would appeal to those who in the past have held out against tough action against Syria : what more evidence do we need about a regime that had brutalised its people ? ""
The prime minister said there was a clear alternative facing Syria . ""
The alternative to political transition at the top of Syria is revolution from the bottom in Syria .
It is in everybody 's interests – the Syrian people , the region , the wider world , the fight against terrorism – that transition takes place quickly .
The sooner that happens , the sooner the people of Syria can be freed from the tyranny under which they are currently suffering .
"" The prime minister 's remarks show that Britain believes the violence in Syria on Wednesday , which saw the assassination of Assad 's brother - in - law and his defence minister , may mark a turning point .
Britain has believed it would take a rapid escalation of events on the ground to persuade Putin to change tack .
Diplomats are likely to note that the prime minister said he would like a new UN security council resolution to be agreed under chapter seven of the UN charter , which authorises the use of force .
British sources said Cameron believes this would provide crucial legal authority for non - military intervention in Syria .
But invoking chapter seven could provide legal cover for military intervention at a later stage , though this would depend on the wording of the security council resolution .
The sources pointed out that chapter seven is mentioned in the draft resolution .
Russia has been wary of supporting a new UN resolution on Syria partly because it believes that Britain and France stretched the resolution agreed on Libya .
This authorised military action to protect civilians from aggressive attacks by the regime in Tripoli .
Moscow believes that London and Paris bent the law to use the security council to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi ."
2012-08-04,"Afghanistan 's parliament has voted to remove the country 's two top security ministers from their jobs , a move that could disrupt the handover from western to Afghan troops , and destabilise a government already under pressure over corruption .
MPs passed votes of no confidence in the defence minister , Abdul Rahim Wardak , and the interior minister , Bismillah Khan Mohammadi , criticising them on Saturday for failing to prevent cross - border shelling from Pakistan and security lapses that contributed to the murder of a northern MP at his daughter 's wedding last month .
President Hamid Karzai 's office issued a statement acknowledging the vote , which neither condemned nor endorsed it .
He promised a decision on the ministers ' future after a meeting of his national security council on Sunday .
The ministers may stay in power , as Karzai has effectively ignored previous parliamentary votes against some of his ministerial candidates by appointing them in an acting capacity then leaving them on the job for months at a time .
But he has recently promised both his people and the international community a clean - up of the country 's notoriously corrupt government . ""
The president has to introduce [ new candidates ] before a month is up , "" said Kabul MP Arfanullah Arfan .
"" We are concerned that it should n't be like it was in the past , when acting ministers spent a long time in their jobs .
If this happens again , parliament will take a very serious decision . ""
Wardak , who has been defence minister for nearly eight years and was previously deputy minister , has strong support from western powers in Afghanistan , and with their help has has overseen the expansion of the army 's ranks to over 185,000 .
In the 1980s he fought against the Soviet and Afghan government troops as a mujahideen commander .
He has also studied in the US , and speaks fluent English .
Mohammadi , who also fought as a mujahideen commander , is an ethnic Tajik from the Northern Alliance power block that fought the Taliban in the 1990s and were key to the group 's ousting in 2001 .
He served as chief of staff to the army from 2002 to 2010 , before taking up his current job .
The parliamentary vote came days after an Afghan television station reported that the finance minister , Omar Zakhilwal , another minister who has enjoyed the support of western nations in Afghanistan , had stashed away over $ 1 m ( £ 640,000 ) in foreign bank accounts .
The report prompted calls for an investigation into Zakhilwal 's finances , but he denied any wrongdoing and told the Tolo television channel that the money came from legitimate sources .
He had earned up to $ 1,500 a day as a consultant before taking up his current job in 2009 , he added .

2012-08-07,"A remote - controlled bomb has ripped apart a bus in a popular picnic spot just a few miles north - west of Kabul , killing nine civilians and injuring five others , in a worrying sign of violence encroaching upon the Afghan capital .
Paghman district is secure enough that a mob of furious villagers chased down and attacked a man they spotted detonating the explosives , something Afghans in insurgent - dominated areas would be unlikely to risk for fear of reprisals .
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , condemned the attack .
"" Terrorists who plant roadside bombs on public routes during the holy month of Ramadan , targeting and killing innocent Muslim civilians , are definitely neither Muslims nor Afghans , "" he said in a statement .
The Taliban periodically mount spectacular , deadly attacks inside Kabul , and there have been high - profile kidnappings and assassinations in the capital too .
But the buried bombs that are one of the biggest dangers of the war for non - combatants in the rest of Afghanistan are rare around Kabul , which has a heavy presence of Afghan security forces and foreign troops .
As the Nato - led coalition starts taking soldiers home , however , there are concerns that even once - peaceful parts of the country are seeing an increase in violence .
The site of Tuesday 's early - morning bombing was just a few minutes ' drive from a lakeside hotel where five men killed 13 people and took hundreds hostage in a 12-hour siege in late June .
The Taliban said that attack targeted a place frequented by officials and foreigners who drank and gambled , but the hotel was actually packed with ordinary Afghan families escaping the noise and chaos of the capital in an area that had previously seemed immune to violence .
Last month two large roadside bombs killed nine policemen in central Bamiyan province , the first Afghan security force deaths since 2008 in a place often considered an island of relative calm .
And this weekend an insurgent attack in the same province killed two New Zealand soldiers and injured six , New Zealand 's highest loss from a single attack in more than a decade in Afghanistan .
Paghman is a lush area of valleys dotted with small walled gardens where Kabul residents often go at weekends to escape the city .
The bomb was hidden under a bridge , and exploded as the bus crossed it , Mohammad Zahir , a director of Kabul police , told Associated Press .
The bus was believed to be carrying local residents to work in the city .
Police arrested the man who villagers had captured and beaten . ""
A Taliban member who was behind the IED ( improvised explosive device ) attack in Paghman this morning was arrested by police .
He is badly beaten by public , "" the ministry of interior spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said on Twitter on Tuesday morning .
The Taliban did not immediately claim responsibility for the bombing , which appears to violate orders from the group 's leader to minimise civilian casualties . ""
In terms of the blast this morning I am not claiming responsibility .
We are still researching and talking to our officials in Kabul , "" said insurgent spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid .
The Taliban have a record of both claiming and denying attacks for strategic reasons , regardless of their actual role in the violence ."
2012-08-09,"Diplomats filing into the conference room at Afghanistan 's finance ministry had expected a bland update on accountability targets from the finance minister .
Instead , he brought out personal financial papers and begged for support in the face of what he described as politically motivated corruption allegations , eventually breaking down in tears .
Hazrat Omar Zakhilwal , a young technocrat who has been lionised as a dynamic reformer by many western diplomats , said he had "" acted naively "" in his handling of $ 2 m ( £ 1.3 m ) of campaign funds for President Hamid Karzai 's re - election campaign in 2009 , but denied any wrongdoing .
He launched an impassioned 45-minute defence of his behaviour , waving bank statements and tax receipts , and said he feared for his life and his family 's safety because of his role in trying to clear up a $ 900 m banking scandal , according to sources who attended the meeting , or heard first - hand accounts .
One diplomat described the meeting as "" more emotional than factual "" .
Zakhilwal began weeping towards the end of the meeting and had to leave the room briefly , several sources said , but he returned to finish his presentation .
Stunned diplomats , gathered from across the international community and including senior UN officials , made no comments and asked no questions .
"" I do n't think he necessarily expected support in the room , "" said one western diplomat .
"" But maybe he was hoping that the major donor nations – ones like the US , Britain , Japan – would tell Karzai that if he tries to sack him and can not replace him with a credible minister to follow up on [ funding commitments from July 's ] Tokyo [ aid conference ] , that funds may be reduced . ""
Afghanistan 's Tolo television station made allegations late last month that Zakhilwal had stashed large quantities of money overseas .
But he has hit back with a formal request for the attorney general to investigate his finances , saying the money was earned legitimately from lucrative consulting work done before he took office in 2009 , and real estate investments buoyed by Afghanistan 's decade - long property boom .
An aide , Najib Manalai , told the Guardian that descriptions of the minister crying in Wednesday 's meeting were "" exaggerated "" and said he had not expressed concerns about his family 's safety .
Zakhilwal denied he had asked for support , or that he had admitted any mistakes in handling election funds .
"" I have not asked donors for help , in fact do n't need their help .
I had invited them to brief them on what was going on and about my decision to ask the attorney general to investigate both the accusation against me as well as violations of my rights , "" he said in an emailed message .
Diplomatic sources confirmed details , including Zakhilwal 's tears .
One said he wept in front of the ambassadorial corps .
The $ 2 m figure he cited in connection to the election , and the request for support , were also mentioned , said a diplomat .
Many diplomats in Kabul , despite their commitment to fighting Afghanistan 's rampant graft , recognise that it is difficult for senior officials to stay entirely clean in a system of patronage politics riven with corruption .
Some take a pragmatic "" good enough "" approach to working with and supporting officials they consider relatively untainted .
There is little doubt that Zakhilwal created enemies with his handling of Kabul Bank , a lender that nearly collapsed in late 2010 when it emerged that members of the Kabul elite had been treating it as a kind of private piggybank .
The government 's slow handling of the scandal jeopardised millions of dollars in aid last year and Zakhilwal played a key role in convincing international donors that Kabul was making progress .
Officials argue they have now drawn up charge sheets and recovered tens of millions of dollars , but critics point out that there have still been no prosecutions . ""
Kabul Bank , he said , is certainly a big factor in the smearing campaign , "" the aide Manalai said when asked about Zakhilwal 's comments that he was being persecuted for his clean - up efforts .
The question marks over Zakhilwal 's job come just after parliament voted to unseat the defence and interior ministers , leaving the country without its two most important security officials in the middle of the fighting season .
The defence minister , Abdul Rahim Wardak , who stepped down shortly after the vote , was another western favourite who had been in the job for eight years .
Diplomats warned that his departure could complicated the handover of security from foreign to Afghan forces ."
2012-09-09,"Some senior Taliban figures are ready to negotiate a ceasefire and might be ready to accept a long - term US military presence in Afghanistan as part of a comprehensive peace deal , according to a report to be published on Monday based on interviews with Taliban officials and negotiators .
The report , published by the Royal United Services Institute , finds that the Taliban is determined to make a decisive break with al - Qaida as part of a settlement and is open to negotiation about education for girls , but is adamantly opposed to the constitution which it sees as a prop for President Hamid Karzai 's government .
The Taliban insurgents will not negotiate with the Karzai government largely because of its record of corruption .
They do not trust Kabul to run fair elections , which suggests that , even if the moderates interviewed in the study prevailed within Taliban circles , serious obstacles to a peace deal would remain .
The institute 's report , entitled Taliban Perspectives on Reconciliation , is the product of interviews with four unnamed figures , two of whom were ministers in the former Taliban government and are still close to the inner circle of leadership .
One is described as being "" closely associated "" with Mullah Mohammad Omar , the Taliban leader .
A third is portrayed as "" a senior former mujahideen commander and lead negotiator for the Taliban "" , although not part of the movement itself , and the fourth is said to be "" an Afghan mediator with extensive experience negotiating with the Taliban "" .
The report concludes : "" The Taliban would be open to negotiating a ceasefire as part of a general settlement , and also as a bridge between confidence - building measures and the core issue of the distribution of political power in Afghanistan . ""
A ceasefire would require strong Islamic justification , obscuring any hint of surrender , "" it adds .
Even more surprising , in view of the official Taliban propaganda portraying it as leading a struggle against foreign invaders , the report says the insurgents are "" prepared to accept a long - term US military presence in Afghanistan "" .
According to one interviewee , described as a founder member of the Taliban , a settlement that left US troops operating out of five primary military bases – Kandahar , Herat , Jalalabad , Mazar - e - Sharif and Kabul – might be acceptable as long as the US presence "" does not impinge on our independence and religion "" .
In other words , the Taliban might accept continuing US counter - terrorist operations targeting their former ally , al - Qaida , as long as the bases were not used as a launching pad for attacks on other countries or for interference in Afghan politics .
The report even suggests that the Taliban would co - operate in tracking down al - Qaida members , noting that the leadership and base "" deeply regret "" their past association with the global jihadist group .
Michael Semple , one of the report 's co - authors and a former EU envoy to Afghanistan , said that interviewees represented a significant but not yet dominant strand in Taliban views .
"" We are not saying that this is some kind of poll that says three out of four Taliban members are in favour of a ceasefire , "" he said .
"" But there is a part of the movement who see there is no prospect of a military victory and so ceasefire would make sense .
This is not the official line , but rather the outer fringe of Taliban thought .
It 's not mainstream yet . ""
Semple , now at Harvard University , interviewed another Taliban commander in July , who also admitted there was no prospect of an insurgent victory , but he said that commander was not part of the institute 's study .
Contacts between US officials and Taliban representatives have stalled largely because of failure to conclude a confidence - building deal to exchange five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay for a US soldier captured by insurgents .
Substantive talks , which were due to be held in Qatar , are expected to remain on hold until after the US presidential election in November , but senior US officials said they were holding discussions this week with Pakistan , where the Taliban leadership is based , about the safe passage of insurgent officials for future peace talks . ""
Reconciliation remains a key component of our strategy , "" a senior US official said .
"" The safe passage working group was meeting this week alone as a piece of that , and Ambassador [ Marc ] Grossman [ the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan ] will embark on an upcoming trip at some point to continue to pursue this in a very robust manner .
… ""
Another senior official stressed that the official US designation on Friday of the Haqqani network , a Taliban faction based in the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan , would not rule out future talks with the group , and would not lead to the financial sanctions against Pakistan .
The official disowned allegations made last year by Admiral Mike Mullen , the outgoing chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , who described the Haqqani network as "" a veritable arm "" of Pakistani intelligence .
"" I want to just unequivocally state that this in no way is the consensus , unanimous view of this administration ; that we are making absolutely no effort to begin a process to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism , "" the US official said .
Semple said he did not think the designation of the Haqqanis would have any serious impact on future peace talks . ""
The US have already given them a good few chances to to do politics , "" he said .
"" They are really at the heart of the nastiest part of the armed struggle . """
2012-09-12,"Hamid Karzai , the president of Afghanistan , has condemned the film that sparked violence in Libya and Egypt as an abhorrence and insult to all Muslims , warning that it would damage inter - faith relations .
The strongly worded statement is likely to be the first many Afghans hear of the once obscure , 13-minute film , which was made by a California property developer and attacks the prophet Muhammad , suggesting he was a fraud .
The low - budget film , appearing like a trailer , was first shown on YouTube , then on Egyptian television .
Karzai called for "" efforts to prevent the release of this insulting film "" , but did not call for restraint in demonstrations , or criticise the rioting , or the death of the US ambassador in Libya .
Instead he said the production would fan tension , and called for the film to be banned . ""
This offensive act has stoked inter - faith enmity and confrontation and badly impacted the peaceful coexistence between human beings , "" the English - language statement said .
Clerics warned that the film was likely to kindle anger among devout Afghans , with a real possibility of more violence .
Said Hosain Alami Balkhi , an influential MP and cleric , said : "" I am sure in the future when the nation and society understand about the film , that this is an insult to Islam , there will be a very serious reaction , as there was before when the Qur'ans were burned [ by US troops at an airbase ] .
"" If the US insults the prophet , their sons and soldiers are in Afghanistan , and the people of Afghanistan always show that they are very sensitive about their religion . ""
News usually travels slowly in a country where most people are illiterate and an electricity supply is an elite privilege .
Protests are most likely to erupt after Friday prayers when preachers might discuss the film .
Afghanistan has endured deadly riots several times in recent years in response to western actions viewed as insulting to Islam .
Last year after Karzai condemned the burning of a Qur'an by the American pastor Terry Jones ( who has supported the controversial new film ) an angry mob stormed a UN office in normally peaceful north Afghanistan and killed seven foreign employees .
Five Afghans also died in the protests , and at least a dozen others in rioting in Kandahar .
This year American soldiers accidentally burned copies of the Qur'an at a US airbase north - east of Kabul , again sending the country into paroxysms of violence .
In both cases many western diplomats were angry that Karzai did not do more to stave off violence ."
2012-09-12,"The film that sparked the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi caused uproar across the Muslim world .
Protesters took to the streets in some countries , US citizens were warned to keep a low profile and public condemnations of the film were issued .
Afghanistan The president , Hamid Karzai , condemned the movie , which he described as "" inhuman and insulting "" .
The US embassy in Kabul appealed to Afghan leaders for help "" maintaining calm "" over the film , a statement said .
An Afghan official said the government had temporarily blocked access to YouTube to prevent people from watching the film .
Aimal Marjan , general director of information technology at the ministry of communications , said the site was blocked for about 90 minutes on Wednesday until YouTube took the video down .
Access to the site was then restored , he said .
The government decided to temporarily deny access to YouTube because of concerns the video could spark protests , he added .
The Taliban called on Afghans to prepare for a fight against Americans and urged insurgents to "" take revenge "" on US soldiers . ""
The Islamic Emirate calls on religious heads around the country to completely inform Muslim followers of the inhumane acts of Americans … and make them ready for a long - term fight , "" the group said in a statement , using the name it calls itself .
Earlier this year , Afghans rioted after US soldiers serving at Bagram prison north of Kabul mistakenly burned hundreds of Qur'ans and other religious materials .
Egypt
The Muslim Brotherhood called for a nationwide demonstration on Friday to protest at "" insults to the prophet "" .
The rallying cry followed a protest in Cairo on Tuesday , in which Islamist demonstrators climbed the walls of the US embassy and tore down an American flag .
Four people were later arrested , and security forces were searching for others who took part in the protest .
The Egyptian president , Mohamed Morsi , asked the Egyptian embassy in Washington to take legal action in the United States against makers of the film , the official state news agency said .
Morsi had requested the mission take "" all legal measures "" .
Mahmoud Hussein , the Muslim Brotherhood 's secretary general , posted a message on the party 's website calling for all Egyptians to join a "" peaceful protest to condemn insults to religious convictions and insults to the prophet "" after noon prayers on Friday in front of main mosques across Egypt .
Another group , the Salafi Call , demanded the suspension of co - operation between Egypt and the US "" until [ the US government ] takes practical measures to stop this farce "" .
Gaza Dozens of people joined a protest in Gaza City , some carrying swords , axes and black flags , and chanting : "" Shame on everyone who insults the prophet , "" and : "" Death to America . ""
The rally was organised by supporters of the militant organisation the Popular Resistance Committees .
Hamas , the larger militant group that governs Gaza , also condemned the film .
Its religious affairs minister , Ismail Radwan , called it an "" insult to the millions of Muslims all over the world "" .
Lebanon Hezbollah condemned the film as an attack on religious belief which it said reflected western policy .
In a statement that made no reference to the killing of US diplomats in Libya , the Shia militant group said the film was an "" immoral act which represents the highest degree of aggression against the highest human right … for respect of beliefs and sanctities "" .
The film aimed to stir tensions and hatred between Muslims and Copts in Egypt and reflected "" the true position of the American - Zionist alliance towards Islam and Muslims "" , it said .
"" In this context , the statements of official US condemnation no longer fool anyone , "" Hezbollah said .
Algeria and Tunisia US embassies in Algeria and Tunisia warned Americans to avoid crowded places , saying that even gatherings intended as peaceful could turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence .
The Algiers embassy said unspecified groups were using online social networks to organise demonstrations "" to protest a range of issues "" there on Wednesday .
The statement out of Tunis cited "" media reports "" indicating protests were planned , but said the embassy remained open ."
2012-09-20,"One of Britain 's allies in the Afghan war has been been sacked in a political shakeup by President Hamid Karzai that saw 10 provincial governors replaced or removed .
Karzai announced he would remove Mohammad Gulab Mangal from office as governor of the vital province of Helmand , a central focus in the Afghan war and the responsibility of the British military .
Karzai 's office declined to say why Mangal had been removed or if he would be reappointed to another governorship or political position .
The southern province was the centre of the Afghan drug trade and a Taliban stronghold , making it a focal point for NATO and Afghan officials .
Helmand claimed nearly double the number of coalition soldiers ' lives compared to Kandahar , the second most deadly province in Afghanistan .
Mangal played a key role in efforts to regain control of the province , quickly winning favour among international military and diplomatic officials .
When he came to office in Helmand in 2008 , he 'd held governorships continuously since 2004 starting in Paktika and then moving to Laghman .
He presided over Helmand during one of the most critical periods of the war , overseeing the influx of surge troops as NATO forces launched the Marjah offensive in 2010 , one of the biggest campaigns of the Afghan war . ""
Before his governorship there was complete insecurity in the province , "" said Muhammad Hassan Haqyar , an independent political analyst in Kabul , who explained that the province saw major improvements under Mangal 's watch .
"" There were also the good relations he had with the foreigners .
They were definitely good for the people of Helmand .
If you have good relations with international organizations , it helps you bring reconstruction to the province . ""
The British embassy in Kabul put out a statement saying Mangal "" made a real difference to the life of ordinary Afghans in Helmand "" .
Previous attempts to oust Mangal by Karzai led to direct intervention from senior British figures , as he was seen as a man with whom they could work .
Still , in manyways Mangal remained a controversial figure .
Despite his generally positive relations with foreigners , the release of the Wikileaks diplomatic cables in 2010 revealed that he did not always have glowing reviews of his international counterparts .
In the cables , Mangal privately criticised the British military for not leaving their bases enough and having only limited interaction with the local population .
Among locals , there were also allegations that Mangal and his administration used the poppy eradication program to extort farmers and generate revenue for his administration .
While these allegations were never confirmed , they were common .
Despite these allegations , a number of locals say that during Mangal 's tenure as governor the province , witnessed dramatic improvements in both security and development .
Habiba Sadat , a member of parliament from Helmand , says that while she never had any personal problems with the governor , he was regarded as a divisive figure in the province . ""
When I myself used to go to Helmand people would come cry to me because they had problems with the current governor .
Also the security problems have recently increased and there were several attacks against police and checkpoints , "" she says .
"" This was the right decision .
A lot of people in Helmand are happy about it . ""
Throughout Afghanistan , a total of 10 governors , including Mangal , will be removed or reassigned .
The move comes during efforts by the Karzai administration to improve government efficiency to address concerns among foreign donors .
"" We needed to change some governors because some provinces need better governance and better governments , some provinces needed fresh blood , and some governors will change to other provinces , "" says Hamid Elmi , a spokesman for Karzai .
"" Of course some governors were not able to carry out their duties and they were not efficient any more so we needed fresh blood . ""
In Afghanistan , governors are appointed by the president rather than elected .
The 10 provinces with new governors include Kabul , Helmand , Takhar , Faryab , Logar , Laghman , Wardak , Baghlan , Nimroz , and Badghis ."
2012-09-20,"The meeting took place on Monday last week in building 101 on the main road just outside the town of Gereshk .
At one end of a long table was an oversized portrait of Hamid Karzai , and sitting opposite it was Saleem Rodi , the quietly spoken district governor .
Rodi was chairing this gathering , huddled around him were the most senior security officials in the area – Afghan and British – and they were in conspiratorial mood .
The subject was the insurgency , their aim was surprise , and their plans had a name : Operation Qalb ( Heart ) .
Rodi said only the people in the room knew the details of the forthcoming attack , and secrecy was paramount if the Taliban were to be caught unawares ; other missions had been hindered by leaks .
He wanted to hear from everyone around the table about how civilian casualties could be minimised if and when the shooting started .
"" We have sacrificed a lot of blood already , "" he said .
Helmand province has been the fiercest battleground in Nato 's fight with the Taliban over the last 11 years , and its central district of Nahr - e Saraj has become the most violent area within it .
There is no place quite like it .
Eighteen British soldiers have died there since the beginning of the year , nine in the last 10 weeks .
Afghan soldiers have perished in even greater numbers , 25 since April .
Hours before this security meeting , a government official was assassinated less than a mile away .
The violence here has polarised opinions about the state of the country .
No other place in Afghanistan better reflects the competing views about the future – the claims and counter claims about what can and can not be achieved in the two years before combat troops from Nato 's International Security and Assistance Force ( Isaf ) leave Afghanistan for good .
This urgency prompted British and Afghan commanders to undertake another big heave during this summer 's fighting season , co - ordinating three major operations in an attempt to drive the insurgents into sparsely populated desert areas where , it is hoped , they will struggle to mount meaningful attacks against the main towns .
Two of these assignments have been in Nahr - e Saraj , where Afghan and British troops have pushed into badlands that have been a haven for the Taliban for nearly 20 years , and even longer for the narco - gangs they are often aligned with .
British commanders say this is the main reason why casualties have been so high : because the fight is being taken to the insurgents , not the other way around .
But despite having overwhelming military superiority , these gains are gradual and sometimes come at a terrible cost .
Whether the areas can be held in the long term is a question nobody can answer .
One British officer involved in both operations in Nahr - e Saraj conceded he was surprised by the insurgents ' resilience .
"" I am constantly amazed by them , "" he said .
"" They are completely over - matched by us and the Afghan army .
We keep killing them , but they keep coming back for more . ""
Unable to fight face to face , the insurgents have been attempting to derail the clearance strategy with a mix of roadside bombs and sniper fire .
But another tactic has proved much more successful .
Their ability to "" turn "" members of the Afghan security forces to attack Isaf soldiers prompted Nato 's hasty decision to reduce some joint patrols with Afghan troops .
The so - called green on blue killings have not all been engineered by the insurgents , but they now know how to hurt the western alliance – and will try harder .
For the British , one of the main aims of Operation Qalb is to reinforce security around Gereshk , the busy town that accounts for more than half of the people in Nahr - e Saraj .
Having driven the insurgents out of Gereshk , street by street , building by building , this is one of the military 's showpiece legacies .
The bazaar here used to look like a bomb had hit it , or several probably .
Now that it is vibrant and comparatively calm , business has begun to take root .
In the last two years , 500 shops have been built in the town , and all have been bought .
Talking to Afghans who live there , it is obvious they are grateful for being in the security bubble .
They also admit feeling apprehensive about what will happen when Isaf leaves .
Bahlool Khan , who has just been re - elected as chair of the Gereshk local council , said : "" In the past there was a lot of fighting .
There was a lot of bloodshed and people were killing each other .
There was no education , no health .
People were hiding behind walls .
Nobody trusts the insurgents .
People have not forgotten . ""
One woman living in Gereshk added : "" The women living here are quite happy to have Isaf around .
The girls are going to school again .
We do n't want the old tribal wars to come back .
It has become more peaceful , especially in the bazaar .
We do n't want to go back to the Taliban days when Isaf goes . ""
The best way to protect them , Afghan and Nato commanders have decided , is to push the insurgents further away from the town , deeper into Helmand .
The Afghan army has taken the lead in the two most recent operations , supported by Danish and British forces , including the Grenadier Guards , who are stationed at Main Operating Base Price , a short drive from Gereshk .
The tactic is simple , but requires feats of co - ordination to get right .
On Monday and Tuesday nights last week , 1,200 Afghan troops from the 3rd Kandak ( battalion ) , along with 200 British soldiers and advisers , left their neighbouring camps to take up discreet positions in the insurgent - filled region of Pulpazay .
Forming a steel ring around villages and compounds , the Afghan National Army ( ANA ) began a series of house to house searches , gradually sweeping its way through the area , flushing out insurgents .
Commanders who have been on previous operations say few insurgents stand and fight , and those who try do not come out alive .
The ones who run are caught in the net around the village and are handed over to the police .
All the details of this latest operation have not been disclosed yet because it is not over .
But the early days of the mission suggest at least some success .
Forty - four improvised explosive devices were discovered , as well as "" a significant weapons cache , radio equipment and hundreds of rounds of ammunition "" .
It will be another week before this mission finishes , by which time the ANA hopes to have built permanent checkpoints to deter the insurgents from coming back again .
Locally elected councillors have been preaching there too , offering modest gestures – such as repairing a roof or well – to help persuade those who might be sceptical about whether their "" liberation "" will last , or do them any good .
The facts that the ANA is taking the lead in these exercises and that Nahr - e Saraj has elected officials are regarded by the British as a measure of the progress that has been made in this district over the last three years .
But can the Afghan army , which has basic equipment and is still evolving as a fighting force , continue to protect the safer areas , let alone take on the insurgents in places where the Taliban appear to remain strong ?
British commanders believe they can do the former but are more hesitant about the latter . ""
Last year there was violence inside populated areas ; this year , the violence is still at the same level , but it has been displaced , "" said Brigadier Doug Chalmers , commander of Task Force Helmand .
"" Everyone talks about Nahr - e Saraj as if it is toxic .
There is a northern part of the district that has a lot of insurgency activity inside rural villages .
But the actual city of Gereshk is growing .
It is not a city under siege , otherwise it would be withering .
Gereshk gives me confidence we are providing the environment for the Afghans to regain a bit of control . ""
If people were n't bothering to invest , I would be nervous that what we are doing here might be a bit transitory .
But if you go there , it is a bustling regional town .
How much better could it be ?
External investors are oblivious to the violence .
"" There are big caveats , as Chalmers acknowledges .
"" Is it going to continue to move forward ?
I think it will , but I ca n't guarantee that it will .
Will there be the same level of change that we have seen over the last two years ?
The answer is , I am not sure there will be .
The Afghans will do things differently , and as they take responsibility , it will change the dynamic in a way that we do n't really know yet . ""
Chalmers said it may be more important to the Afghan security forces to hold what they already have .
"" The fact that there may still be an insurgency when we have gone , is that going to affect the city of Gereshk , or will Afghans be prepared to tolerate that ?
My feeling is that they are slightly more pragmatic than the west .
They know what matters . ""
The local security forces were already reaching out to the insurgents , he said , and local accommodations and agreements could follow .
This could lead to deals that leave the Afghan government in control of some areas , and the Taliban free to live in others .
That is not what the UK had once hoped for , but it might be Helmand 's best hope now .
"" Our job is to enable the Afghans to enter the conversation from a position of strength , "" said Chalmers .
"" It is very difficult to have those conversations with people if you are the weakling in the room .
And it is very difficult for us as genuine outsiders to do that level of negotiation .
A lot of it is quite local , village to village .
It is very difficult for us to do , and I do n't think it is right for us to do . ""
Chalmers admitted anxiety about relinquishing all control to the Afghans , as Nato is gradually doing as part of its withdrawal strategy .
He likened it to a parent watching a child going to university , and becoming truly independent .
"" I have to force myself to accept that the only way for this to work is to let go . ""
General Adrian Bradshaw , commander of British forces in Afghanistan , and deputy to Isaf 's commander , General John Allen , said the high levels of violence this year in places such as Nahr - e Saraj were symptomatic of something else .
He believes the Taliban are pushing back as hard as they can because their leaders are preparing to enter the political and reconciliation process .
"" What we would expect from an insurgency entering the political arena is to seek to maximise the bargaining position .
It is often suggested that the Taliban will simply wait us out until 2015 and scale down their effort , and what we are seeing now does not represent the maximum effort .
I do n't think that is credible at all . ""
What they will be doing now , and what they have been doing all of this summer , is absolutely maximising their effort to full capacity because they have to maximise their bargaining position when entering the negotiating arena .
All the indications we get from intelligence suggest there is a real push on their junior commanders , from their senior commanders sitting outside the country , to keep up the fight . ""
Bradshaw said he believed the Taliban had been struggling with funding because they made no money out of opium poppies last year .
The insurgents were also short of weapons , he added .
"" [ They ] are now coming to the realisation that keeping on and keeping on , pounding themselves against us and our Afghan partners , is not delivering .
This is the beginning of an understanding by their higher command that they have to find an alternative approach .
And there are signs that some of them are looking to do just that .
We are seeing it to a certain degree at all levels .
We see signs from mid - level fighters of dissatisfaction .
"" Some of them leave the organisation and weare aware that at higher level there also people interested in a political path , or at least concluding that they will not achieve their political ends by military means alone . ""
However , Bradshaw admitted it would be wrong to suggest the insurgency was in any way spent .
"" I do n't want to paint too rosy a picture of the situation .
The fact remains that the insurgency is still a significant threat to peace and stability . ""
And nowhere more so than in Nahr - e Saraj .
The area has always been a hotbed of tribal and gang rivalry , quite separate from the insurgency .
The assassination of a government official in the district last week was not claimed by the Taliban .
That kind of murder is not uncommon in Helmand ; such attacks happened before UK troops arrived , and they will continue once they have gone .
British commanders accept that and understand better than perhaps ever before that their forces have probably done as much as they can , or were ever likely to be able to do , in a society as complex and feudal as Afghanistan .
Now it is up to the Afghans themselves .
One of the men who will have most responsibility for the security of Nahr - e Saraj in the coming years is Colonel Hamayoon , the 36-year - old commander of the ANA 's 3rd Kandak .
The officer has been working with the British over the last two years , and says he has learned a great deal from them .
Like all commanders in every military , he wants better equipment and more of it .
But there is a greater need : he wants to go it alone , without Isaf . ""
This is our country and our people , and it is our obligation to take responsibility for their safety .
There will be peace .
The only question is when . """
2012-09-23,"Two prominent Irish politicians have flown to Afghanistan to offer advice to Hamid Karzai 's government that could help to kickstart a formal process of peace talks with the Taliban .
The unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson and the nationalist Denis
Haughey are in Kabul as part of a UK - led initiative to give impetus to reconciliation and reintegration with the insurgents .
With the Taliban seemingly inching towards talks to end the conflict , it is hoped the experiences of the Irish peace process will give Afghans the belief that a political solution is possible , despite years of bloodshed and bitter ethnic rivalry .
Sir Richard Stagg , the UK ambassador to Afghanistan , told the Guardian he hoped "" the visit should bring home to people that you can change things , just as France and Germany did in 1945 .
However ghastly , however bloody , however deep the feuds , the hatreds , a moment can come , does come , when they can be addressed . ""
Speaking in Kabul on the first day of talks with members of Afghanistan 's High Peace Council – the body set up by Karzai , the Afghan president , to reach out to the Taliban – Donaldson said he would talk to the insurgents directly , if that was what was needed , and he underlined that both sides would have to get used to dealing with people who had "" blood on their hands "" .
"" You do n't make peace with your friends .
You have to be able to talk to the Taliban .
In Northern Ireland , I lost members of my family .
I do n't come to this from the perspective of some high - minded theoretical approach about peace building .
You have to take hard decisions .
I hope we will be speaking to people who will have the ear of the Taliban to communicate to them what we have said .
"" Donaldson added : "" We have n't come here to tell the Afghans what to do .
We do n't have a template with Northern Ireland stamped on it .
We are here sharing our experience of peace building with Afghanistan and we hope to show even the most intractable conflicts can be resolved if there is the willingness and leadership required .
You need a process .
Peace is not an event , and in Northern Ireland it is still ongoing . ""
The discussions he had had so far revealed that the Afghans were keen to start a formal process but unsure how to start it , Donaldson said .
And they wanted the international community to support , but not interfere , with any talks before the withdrawal of Nato 's combat troops at the end of 2014 , he added .
Stagg said the visit of the two Irish politicians might help to show Afghans that "" even those who are deeply embroiled in a very violent and bloody feud which looks insoluble can actually , if they are willing to make some big choices themselves , find a way to a better environment , a more stable and peaceful one .
"" I hope not to try to ' teach lessons ' on the basis of our Northern Ireland experience , but more to talk through what happened and allow the lessons to emerge naturally .
Despite some awful things happening , we have ended up with people on both sides sharing power in government .
There is a message there .
"" They are n't easy and even when you think they are all done , there may be eruptions from the past , and the answer to that is to address those rather than to fall back to your positions before the agreement . ""
The visit has been arranged and funded by the British government , and Donaldson and Haughey are both involved in a newly formed NGO , the Causeway Institute for Peace - building and Conflict Resolution .
It comes amid ongoing violence , including a series of "" green on blue "" attacks – where members of the Afghan security forces have turned their guns on troops working for Nato 's International Security and Assistance Force .
When David Cameron went to Kabul in July , he mentioned that Northern Ireland might be able to offer Afghanistan some help in any peace process .
"" I have seen it in my own country in Northern Ireland , where people who were involved in trying to kill , maim and bomb civilians , police officers , army personnel and even politicians have actually become politicians themselves and are now involved in the governance of that country . """
2012-09-24,"Two US marines are facing criminal charges for urinating on the bodies of dead Taliban fighters in Afghanistan , after their actions were caught on a video that circulated widely on the internet , the US military said on Monday .
Staff sergeants Joseph W Chamblin and Edward W Deptola will face courts martial , the first criminal charges faced by anyone over the incident .
The video prompted widespread anger in Afghanistan earlier this year ; the Afghan President Hamid Karzai called the marines ' actions "" inhuman "" .
Chamblin and Deptola , were also charged with "" posing for unofficial photographs with human casualties "" , and will face charges over failing to report or stop misconduct by junior marines , the military said .
Three marines have already been disciplined over the urination incident .
Although the video was circulated on the web in January 2012 , the incident actually took place on or around July 27 , 2011 , during a counter - insurgency operation in Afghanistan 's Helmand province , an internal investigation showed .
The video showed four men in army combat gear urinating on the bodies of three men lying on the ground .
The voice of a fifth man can be heard from behind the camera .
The military said on 27 August that three marines had pleaded guilty to charges over the video , but their punishment fell short of criminal prosecution and the men did not face courts martial .
Two of the three pleaded guilty to wrongfully posing for an unofficial photograph with human casualties and admitted urinating on the body of a dead Taliban fighter .
The third pleaded guilty to failing to report the mistreatment of human casualties by other marines , and admitted making a false statement to an investigative officer about his knowledge of the video , according to the Military Times .
The three men face punishments within the military , such as a reduction in rank or extra duties , meaning their names would not have to be published in public .
Chamblin and Deptola , however , also face a series of charges for failing to supervise junior marines .
This includes simple things like failing to require them to wear protective equipment to more serious breaches , like failing to report the "" negligent discharge "" of a grenade launcher .
Deptola is also charged with failing to stop the unnecessary damaging of Afghan compounds , the marines said .
The marines said there were other pending cases in the video investigation .
They declined to elaborate on the incident in which the negligent actions took place ."
2012-10-06,"Insurgents in eastern Afghanistan killed two US soldiers on Saturday , hours after defence secretary Leon Panetta had criticised President Hamid Karzai for failing to recognise the sacrifice of Nato forces .
The soldiers , who were members of a special - operations team , died in a fire - fight in Wardak province , south - west of Kabul .
Their deaths bring the number of international troops killed in Afghanistan this year to 296 , including at least 257 Americans .
The development came amid a spat between Washington and Kabul over what is seen as failing US commitment to tackling terrorism in Pakistan .
At a press conference on Thursday , Karzai criticised the the White House for concentrating on going after insurgents in his country , rather than militants based across the border .
He accused the US of playing a "" double game "" .
Karzai also said Nato was not providing enough weapons for home - grown Afghan forces , suggesting that he might have to appeal to other countries , such as China and Russia , to get them .
The comments drew an uncharacteristically angry response from Panetta .
Speaking in Peru on Friday , the defence secretary said the Afghan president should be thanking allied troops rather than criticising them .
"" We have made progress in Afghanistan because there are men and women in uniform who have been willing to fight and die for Afghanistan 's sovereignty , "" he told reporters .
"" Those lives were lost fighting the right enemy not the wrong enemy and I think it would be helpful if the president , every once in a while , expressed his thanks for the sacrifices that have been made by those who have fought and died for Afghanistan , rather than criticising them . ""
More than 2,000 Americans have been killed in Afghanistan since the conflict began in October 2001 .
Tensions between the two countries have worsened amid a spate of so - called "" green on blue "" attacks , in which members of Nato forces have been killed by insurgents posing as Afghan police or members of the home - trained security force .
Panetta has indicated that this increase in insider attacks will not alter plans for US withdrawal from Afghanistan .
American troops are due to be pulled out by the end of 2014 , handing the responsibility for security to Afghan forces .
However , it is thought that as many as 20,000 US personnel could remain past that date , to assist in training and counterterrorism efforts ."
2012-10-18,"The president , Hamid Karzai , has said he will not accept foreigners on a key election watchdog , a move that risks undermining the credibility of a presidential poll in 2014 .
Karzai also said Afghans would not be willing to grant foreign troops immunity from prosecution while the country was at war , a position that could jeopardise plans for a long - term foreign military presence in the country . ""
The presence of foreigners in the Electoral Complaints Commission [ ECC ] is against the sovereignty of Afghanistan , "" Karzai said at a news conference in Kabul with the visiting Nato chief , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , according to Reuters .
The 2014 election coincides with the departure of Nato - led troops from Afghanistan , and is expected to lay the foundation for the country 's future without the coalition or Karzai , who has ruled for a decade and can not stand for the top office again under Afghan law .
There are already concerns about the potential for fraud , after widespread corruption marred votes in 2009 and 2010 .
Rights groups warned that the ECC would be weakened by the loss of members best able to ignore internal political pressure . ""
In the 2009 - 2010 elections the ECC was the only entity that was involved in the whole process who came out looking good … and that seemed to be due in no small part to the fact that they had internationals involved who did n't have a dog in the fight , "" said Heather Barr , Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch .
"" So it 's really concerning to see that particular institution changed and possibly made less immune to external influence in the runup to what is going to be a very critical election . ""
Karzai 's spokesman Aimal Faizi said foreigners were still welcome as election monitors , but that the Afghan government was able to ensure the poll was fair .
Rasmussen and Karzai also discussed a role for foreign troops after 2014 .
"" This will not be a combat mission .
It will focus on training , advice and assistance .
And we are actively planning for that mission "" , Rasmussen said .
The US and Afghanistan are involved in sensitive negotiations about the shape of a long - term military presence , expected to lay the groundwork for similar deals with other Nato countries .
The most challenging detail is expected to be the legal status of US forces ; the Iraqi government 's refusal to grant immunity precipitated the final pullout of US troops there last year .
Karzai said Afghans would not tolerate such protections either , unless the country became more secure .
"" If Afghanistan is stable and peaceful , the Afghan people will not have much problem with immunity but if Afghanistan is not peaceful or continues to be in a state of war , the Afghan people will not see the benefit of partnership for them , "" Faizi said .
"" Once they have security and peace they will agree with the issue of immunity and it will be easier for the president to go to the people and ask for immunity . """
2012-11-07,"In Afghanistan , there had been little interest in the election , probably because most people felt US policy towards their country was already broadly fixed , with a Nato - agreed deadline of 2014 for the withdrawal of most troops .
President Hamid Karzai and other officials , including the governor of Kandahar province , the Taliban 's birthplace , sent congratulations to Obama on his re - election .
Karzai , whose relationship with the US has often been stormy , said he hoped Obama 's second term would allow greater co - operation between the two countries .
The statement of congratulation said : "" President Karzai also hopes that with the re - election of President Obama , the bilateral relations between Afghanistan and the United States could further expand on the basis of mutual interests of the two countries . ""
The Taliban , whom the US military have now been fighting for over a decade , were less welcoming .
America should focus on its domestic challenges , and leave Afghanistan as soon as possible , they said in a statement after the election results were announced .
"" Obama should take advantage of his second term , and use the opportunity to prevent the US from trying to police the world , and focus instead on solving the problems of Americans , "" the statement said .
"" Obama has realised that Americans are tired of the war and the back - breaking costs of wars .
Therefore he should withdraw the occupying forces from our country as soon as possible and prevent the death of more Americans .
Some members of Afghanistan 's tiny tech - savvy elite were already looking ahead to their own presidential poll , set for 2014 ; there are widespread fears that the vote will be plagued by fraud and security problems , as the last two elections were .
Lotfullah Najafizada , head of current affairs at the influential Tolo TV channel , tweeted : "" The US election is over – smooth and transparent .
What lessons could be learned from it for new democracies such as Afghanistan ? """
2012-11-14,"Pakistan has finally agreed to long - standing demands by Afghanistan to release Taliban prisoners as part of efforts by Hamid Karzai to kickstart a peace process with the Islamist rebel group .
The agreement marked the culmination of more than a year of often acrimonious diplomacy between the two countries , but doubts hung over whether the prisoners to be released were the top - level insurgent leaders demanded by Salahuddin Rabbani , the Afghan official leading efforts to establish talks with the Taliban .
Anywhere between seven and 14 are to be released , but some analysts expressed fears that Afghanistan had been fobbed off with relatively unimportant commanders .
According to Pakistani intelligence officials one name was definitely not on the list : Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , a former deputy head of the Taliban movement who hails from the same Pashtun tribe as Karzai .
His arrest by Pakistani authorities in the city of Karachi in 2010 has long been regarded by analysts as a deliberate move to scupper fledgling talks between one of the most senior insurgent leaders and the Karzai government .
Kabul has demanded his release ever since .
Pakistan has been accused of playing a "" double game "" with the Afghan Taliban , simultaneously giving some support to the Islamist insurgents while being a nominal ally of the Nato countries struggling to bring greater security to Afghanistan .
Diplomats and analysts believe Baradar was arrested because his discussions with the Karzai government were outside the control of Pakistan 's intelligence services .
Rabbani , who has held the position of chairman of the High Peace Council for more than a year , had long refused to visit Islamabad unless the Pakistani government was prepared to include the fate of Baradar on its agenda .
That he turned up in the Pakistani capital this week for days of meetings with civilian and military leaders was taken as a sign the Taliban reconciliation process involving Pakistan was back on track .
But some Afghan analysts continue to doubt Pakistani intentions .
"" This is the game of Pakistan to deliver smaller fish just to extract maximum outcomes but delivering something insignificant , "" said Davood Muradian , director of a Kabul security thinktank .
Last month an Afghan official intimately involved in the negotiating process said Rabbani would demand the release of three prisoners initially : Baradar , Mullah Nooruddin Turabi and Anwar al haq Mujahid .
On Wednesday the BBC reported that Turabi , a former justice minister strongly associated with some of the worst excesses of the Taliban while they were in power in the late 1990s , would be among those released .
Mujahid , a former commander of Taliban faction the Tora Bora Military Front , owes his importance to his father , Younis Khalis , one of the most important mujahideen leaders who fought against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Afghan negotiators also wanted the three men to be released unconditionally , and not into Afghan custody .
Officials said it was worth running the risk they might return to the battlefield because they would have more credibility as peace negotiators .
On Wednesday it was also unclear whether the Pakistanis had agreed to that demand .
Many experts wonder whether the prisoner release will change anything .
"" The reality check is that the war continues , "" said Michael Semple , a former UN and EU diplomat and expert on the Taliban who has long advocated peace talks .
"" Prisoner releases are only useful in a peace process if they address injustice or are part of moves towards a cessation of violence . ""
Putting fighters back on the street without other elements of a ceasefire may sustain the conflict rather than promoting peace .
"" Rabbani is the son of the former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani who was assassinated last year by a man who concealed a bomb in his turban .
The incident appeared to scupper hopes of a negotiated settlement to the war in Afghanistan , with many Afghans assuming Pakistan was responsible for his killing .
Hopes are rising once again , in part because of public and private assurances from senior Pakistani civilian and military leaders who have told Afghan , British and US diplomats that they are committed to a political process .
Diplomats say the powerful army chief Ashfaq Pervez Kayani is , in private , adamant that Pakistan does not want to see the violent return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan , fearing that would only further destabilise Pakistan .
But scepticism remains about Pakistani intentions . ""
The Pakistanis have never ' seen the light ' : they want to be involved to maximise their bargaining position and not ' lose ' on the investment that they have made in backing the Taliban , "" said a western official in Kabul who has been closely involved in peace efforts .
He added that although Pakistan wants a political deal to end the conflict , it does not want one on terms that are unacceptable to the Afghan government .
In the meantime , Pakistan continues to back not only insurgents , but increasingly "" younger and more radical elements with whom they put direct advisers "" , he said ."
2012-11-29,"An Afghan man has slit the throat of a teenage relative because her family turned down his marriage proposal , police say , as activists report a sharp increase in attacks on women in Afghanistan .
President Hamid Karzai marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on Thursday with a speech calling on clerics and community leaders to help stamp out what he described as a "" social menace "" .
"" It destroys love , passion and respect , "" Karzai said in his radio broadcast to the nation .
"" Children who grow up in families that experience violence may be more depressed and violent .
"" The teenager who was killed , Nishina , 15 , was attacked in Kunduz province on Tuesday morning as she was fetching water from a well near her home .
She was set on by a cousin and nephew who slit her throat , said Sayed Sawar Hosseini , spokesman for the provincial police chief .
""
A guy by the name of Mohammad Sadeq , he is her cousin , he had proposed to her on his brother 's behalf , but Nishina and her family refused the proposal , "" Hosseini said by phone . ""
He came back two days ago and attacked her .
Through the co - operation of the family in the area we have finally arrested both of them . ""
The family wanted to see the men hanged , he added .
The killing of Nishina comes almost a year after four men in Kunduz disfigured a teenager and her two sisters with acid , also for turning down a marriage request .
There has been an unusually high number of women attacked and murdered in the province since then , including one husband who killed his wife because he was angry that all their children were girls .
"" We are very concerned about violence against women in Kunduz , "" said Nadira Giyah , head of the department of women 's affairs in the province for the last four years .
"" It has really increased very suddenly over the last nine or 10 months . ""
Three years ago , Giyah 's office dealt with dozens of cases of suicide but just a couple of murders , she said .
But this year they have handled 11 killings , and other parts of the country are seeing similar trends . ""
The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission has recorded an alarming increase in the number of cases of violence against women this year and the murder in Kunduz seems to fit a pattern that has become all too familiar , where men feel free to murder a woman who has angered them , "" said Heather Barr , Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch .
"" The government 's failure to effectively enforce the 2009 law on elimination of violence against women encourages men to believe that they can kill and attack women with impunity . ""
Activists also said they were concerned about a recent demand by the country 's conservative council of clerics , who last year described women as "" secondary "" to men , to be given the power to issue legally binding religious decrees .
The influential group made the request to Karzai during a regular meeting at the presidential palace , Afghanistan 's Tolo television station reported .
Campaigner Wazhma Frogh said : "" I 'm not very worried that it will get implemented .
They have a meeting with President Karzai every week , and he does listen to them , but not much gets implemented . ""
But what is worrying for me is the mentality for this country .
We do risk going backwards .
One day we hear that women ca n't travel alone , another that you are a lesser human being , then this about sharia law .
But how is that possible in a country where you have a constitution , supreme court , and judiciary ? ""

2013-01-07,"The Afghan president is on his way to Washington for what is likely to be a tense visit , with the two uneasy allies set to discuss details of a long - term US military presence in the central Asian nation .
Hamid Karzai , who will meet Barack Obama , wants Washington to stump up for planes , helicopters , heavy weapons and other advanced military equipment for Afghanistan 's still - shaky armed forces .
He also wants more aid money to be channelled through ministries rather than spent by western aid agencies .
The US president is weighing up how many of its troops should remain in Afghanistan when the Nato - led combat mission there ends in 2014 .
But any plan needs Afghan approval , and hanging over the discussions is the question of immunity for US soldiers .
Iraq 's refusal to agree to this condition in effect ended the US presence there , and there are fears it could be a major obstacle to a long - term US presence in Afghanistan .
Karzai , who has criticised Nato and US measures he believes violate national security , admitted this could be a stumbling block in talks .
Karzai may be banking in part on western fears that if cash and other support for the government and security forces are cut , and Afghanistan slips back into civil war or the Taliban gain ground , it could once again become a haven for al - Qaida or similar groups .
"" The world needs us more than we need them , "" Abdul Karim Khurram , Karzai 's chief of staff , told the Washington Post shortly before the visit .
But diplomats in Kabul warn that Karzai may have underestimated US fatigue with the war , and anger over its cost , at a time when the national economy is struggling .
Rampant , large - scale corruption in Afghanistan also makes it harder to justify aid spending to voters tightening their belts at home .
Karzai 's government in turn has accused the west of fuelling corruption and waste in the way it spends money in Afghanistan .
The finance minister , Omar Zakhilwal , is pushing for more money to be put straight through the government budget to be spent by ministries like education and health , rather than channelled through foreign aid organisations .
"" We believe that the way the US money is spent here , there 's a lot of waste , particularly money spent through contractors and outside sources , "" Zakhilwal told the Wall Street Journal before the visit .
Much of the aid cash flowed back to the US through "" big consultant salaries and overheads "" , he added .
Karzai has other grievances which are likely to add to challenges at the talks .
Among the complaints are that the US military is still holding Afghan prisoners in Afghanistan , despite a deal last year to hand over the US jail and the men inside it . ""
The war has been fought in a very incorrect manner ...
It did n't improve the situation , it worsened it , "" Khurram said ."
2013-01-08,"With the US poised to draw down its military forces from Afghanistan and peace talks with the Taliban seemingly back on the agenda , President Hamid Karzai arrives in Washington on Tuesday for three days of discussions with far - reaching implications for both countries .
On Friday Karzai holds his first face - to - face talks with President Obama since last year 's Nato summit in Chicago , shortly after the pair had signed a long - term strategic partnership .
Karzai has said that the main topic of discussion will be the continued US military involvement in Afghanistan .
The Obama administration is committed to withdrawing the majority of its 60,000-strong military stationed there by the end of next year – with the size of the remaining force still to be decided , as well as the key question of legal immunity for US military operating in the country .
Under the agreement signed last year , some US troops may remain to train Afghan forces and continue to fight al - Qaida cells .
General John Allen , the Nato commander and top US general in Afghanistan , has recommended keeping between 6,000 and 15,000 troops in the country after 2014 .
An unnamed US official told Reuters the White House has asked for scenarios for between 3,000 and 9,000 troops to remain .
But the Afghan leader is said to want an end to US military operations in villages , as well as protection from militants based across the border with Pakistan .
Karzai also wants the US to provide helicopters , heavy weapons and other advanced military equipment for Afghanistan 's army as well as warplanes for the Afghan air force , and for humanitarian and reconstruction aid to be channelled through Afghan government ministries rather than via western aid agencies .
Kabul has accused the US of fostering corruption by giving funding directly to warlords .
Officials are also to broach the on - again , off - again peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government .
The prospects for talks has been helped by Pakistan 's recent release of groups of imprisoned Taliban commanders , including eight people on New Year 's Eve , following an improvement in the Afghan - Pakistan relations that are crucial to any hopes of a peaceful settlement .
Hopes have been further raised by a meeting in France between the Taliban and the Afghan High Peace Council last month , which US officials have described as "" promising "" .
Direct talks with the Karzai government have been ruled out by the Taliban , which wants to negotiate with the American government , while the US says that the Taliban should speak directly to the Afghan government .
To foster negotiations President Obama is likely to urge that Kabul support the Taliban 's establishment of a political consulate in Qatar .
Other topics to be discussed during the Washington meetings include the fate of Afghanistan 's Parwan Detention Centre , which was to have been handed over to Afghan control last year but now seems likely to stay under US control until 2014 .
The Afghan leader will also meet secretary of state Hillary Clinton – who is back at work after hospitalisation from a blood clot and concussion – and plans to give a high - profile speech at Washington 's Georgetown University .
Karzai is also expected to visit his ally Asadullah Khalid , the head of Afghanistan 's homeland security agency , who is in the US receiving medical treatment after being injured in a Taliban assassination attempt in Kabul last month ."
2013-01-09,"US officials have raised the possibility of a complete military withdrawal from Afghanistan for the first time , as President Hamid Karzai arrived in Washington for three days of discussions over military and economic ties .
In a briefing for journalists in advance of Karzai 's visit , Ben Rhodes , deputy national security adviser , said the White House is prepared to consider all options for US troop levels after 2014 , including a so - called "" zero option "" if conditions allowed .
On Friday Karzai holds his first face - to - face talks with President Barack Obama since last year 's Nato summit in Chicago , shortly after the pair had signed a long - term strategic framework agreement .
The Obama administration is committed to withdrawing the majority of its 68,000-strong military stationed there by the end of next year – with the size of the remaining force still to be decided , as well as the key question of legal immunity for US military operating in the country post-2014 .
The talks between the two governments were "" not aiming to keep a certain number of US troops in Afghanistan "" , said Doug Lute , deputy assistant to Obama and White House coordinator for South Asia .
The final number would be "" significantly lower "" than the 68,000 troops currently on the ground , Lute said .
"" They are going to be talking about missions and authorities , not numbers , "" Rhodes said .
Asked if the troop level options included zero , Rhodes replied : "" That would be an option we would consider . ""
Later he added : "" We would n't rule out any option … we 're not guided by keeping any [ specific ] number of troops in the country . ""
The White House warned that no agreements or decisions are expected to result from this week 's visit by Karzai , describing it as "" a good time for the two presidents to sit down and consult "" ahead of the US military draw - down and the Afghan elections scheduled for April 2014 .
Under the strategic framework agreement signed last year , some US troops may remain to train Afghan forces and continue to fight al - Qaida cells .
General John Allen , the Nato commander and top US general in Afghanistan , has recommended keeping between 6,000 and 15,000 troops in the country after 2014 .

But the Afghan leader is said to want an end to US military operations in villages , as well as protection from militants based across the border with Pakistan .
The final number of any US forces in Afghanistan after 2014 would depend on the perceived strength of al - Qaida and its affiliates in the country , the progression of Afghan security forces , and the legal protection granted to US forces by the Afghan government – the last a sticking point in the bilateral security agreement being negotiated between the two governments with a deadline of November this year .
"" I think they will have very candid discussions about the sorts of immunities that the bilateral security agreement might have , "" Lute said .
Karzai also wants the US to provide helicopters , heavy weapons and other advanced military equipment for Afghanistan 's army as well as warplanes for the Afghan air force , and for humanitarian and reconstruction aid to be channelled through Afghan government ministries rather than via western aid agencies .
Kabul has accused the US of fostering corruption by giving funding directly to warlords .

Direct talks with the Karzai government have been ruled out by the Taliban , which wants to negotiate with the American government , while the US says that the Taliban should speak directly to the Afghan government .
"" We have a clearer path toward Afghan - led peace talks than we have had in the past , and I think that is what will be discussed , "" Lute said .
The Afghan leader will also meet secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Thursday – who is back at work after hospitalisation from a blood clot and concussion – as well as outgoing defense secretary Leon Panetta .
Karzai also plans to give a high - profile speech at Washington 's Georgetown University .
Karzai is to visit his ally Asadullah Khalid , the head of Afghanistan 's homeland security agency , who is in the US receiving medical treatment after being injured in a Taliban assassination attempt in Kabul last month ."
2013-01-10,"On Tuesday , Obama administration spokesperson Ben Rhodes announced for the first time that the US may consider a "" zero option "" – that is , pulling all troops out of Afghanistan – by the end of 2014 .
While the administration has insisted that it will not debate troops numbers with Afghan President Hamid Karzai during their meetings this week , only the division of "" missions and authorities "" between the US and Afghanistan , everyone knows that this is a lie .
What is really at stake in these meetings is the number of troops – and the corresponding political investment that the US will have in Afghanistan 's stability – after the end of the formal combat mission .
There is little doubt today that the US is heading for the exits in Afghanistan .
In 2009 , President Obama committed the US to moving from a combat to a support mission for the Afghan military units by 2014 , while drawing down the total number of US troops from the 68,000 currently present .
The "" US - Afghanistan strategic partnership "" commits the US to stay in some capacity until 2024 , but it does not specify how many troops will remain or what they will do .
Until recently , the Obama administration was considering a range of options , from drawing down the number of troops by 30,000 by June 2013 , to a more gradual drawdown , proposed by General John Allen , which would leave between 6,000 - 15,000 troops in country after formal combat operations end .
Facing enormous budget pressures and rapidly declining public support for the war , the Obama administration has begun to consider even lower numbers , such as 3,000 - 4,000 troops , or even a pullout of all but its special forces .
It has already significantly reduced the number of civilians who will remain in Afghanistan and scaled back its ambitions for reconstruction and aid in the country .
The reaction to the airing of the "" zero option "" in Afghanistan has been predictable .
While it is highly likely that this option is little more than a negotiating ploy , it has drawn out all of those who have a vested interest in preserving an indefinite American role in the country .
Thursday , Afghan MPs warned that the US risks a return to civil war if it pulls all of its troops out of the country , and emphasized that training and equipment of the Afghan National Army – now underway for 12 years , to little effect – must continue apace .
Fred and Kimberly Kagan , both of whom served as advisors to General David Petraeus in Afghanistan and wrote op - eds in favor of the war effort , recently attacked the "" zero option "" and accused the administration of throwing away everything the US had fought for .
Neoconservative John Bolton has also accused the administration of seeking an excuse for a withdrawal and called plans for a zero option a "" guarantee of a Taliban takeover "" .
A number of high - ranking former Pentagon officials have also come out against the zero option .
On 2 January , former General Jack Keane blasted the administration for not making withdrawal plans based on "" conditions on the ground "" .
Last Monday , retired General Stanley McChrystal publicly called for an enduring "" security presence "" in the country .
All of this suggests that there are strong institutional forces within the Pentagon , and among some quarters of the Republican party , that will seek to keep bases and significant military forces in Afghanistan as a way of preventing a civil war and retaining some influence over the Karzai government .
The Obama administration should ignore these arguments and keep the zero option on the table for three reasons .
First , keeping a sizable number of troops – for example , 15,000 troops – will do relatively little but provide the Taliban with a rich set of targets .
The current US force – four times that size – is unable to stop the growing violence in the country or halt the Taliban infiltration of military and police units .
A much smaller force of 15,000 troops , finding itself under heavy demand by the Afghan military in its struggle against the Taliban , would be no more capable to stop these trends than the current , reasonably well - equipped , US forces .
Unless the US limits the size of its force and the scope of its "" support missions "" , it will wind up backstopping a corrupt , incompetent and desertion - prone Afghan military in the midst of a civil war , while having fewer logistical and supply resources than it does now .
Moreover , unless the issue of legal immunity for US troops in Afghanistan is resolved , there is also the chance that most US forces will be largely confined to bases , especially if they lose some of their logistics assets .
This was the case at the end of the Iraq mission .
The key difference with Iraq is that these US bases will be an attractive target amid a civil war .
The likely result is that American troops will be hunkered down in bases , awaiting risky support operations in the midst of a civil war , while more and more attacks occur on their doorstep .
Second , it is unclear that retaining a residual force in Afghanistan will convey any of the "" influence "" that opponents of the "" zero option "" presume .
The presence of a small combat force is unlikely to affect the calculations of Hamid Karzai , who has proven himself more than willing to engage in conspiracy theories and attack the US , if it conveys a domestic political advantage .
It is a regular trope among Republican circles to argue that military bases convey influence , and to point to Iraq – where the US sought military bases , but eventually gave up due to concerns over American soldiers falling under Iraqi jurisdiction – as an example where its departure led to growing authoritarianism and a foreign policy sympathetic to America 's enemies .
Yet these critics never spell out why the mere presence of a token number of US troops is going to significantly influence the decisions of a government with vastly different interests than Washington .
The US - Afghanistan relationship will be shaped by much bigger political and economic forces , especially as the Karzai government decides how to respond to a resurgent Taliban .
The presence or absence of a small contingent of US forces is unlikely to have any impact on that relationship .
Third , the presence of US troops , even in a support capacity , will further the culture of dependency that has permitted the worst abuses of the Karzai government to continue .
The military has received billions in aid and years of direct combat support and training .
The result has not been the creation of a reliable US partner , but rather a military prone to desertions and poor performance .
Today , the Afghan government remains unable to field more than one combat brigade – out of a total of 23 created since 2001 – that can fight on its own .
Moreover , this culture of dependency has sustained a government that stole an election , engaged in blatant corruption and shown signs of increasing brutality .
In late 2012 , the Karzai government blocked investigations into how friends of the Karzai family turned the Afghan central bank into a Ponzi scheme , and resumed public hangings of Taliban fighters and criminals .
At the same time , Karzai has blamed the US for generating insecurity in Afghanistan and has had the gall to suggest that continuing immunity for US troops after 2014 will be conditional on their ability to provide "" peace and stability "" for his country .
The lesson of the last 12 years is that Karzai can only get away with this because the US so desperately needs him in place in order to justify its counterinsurgency strategy .
All of this suggests that the "" zero option "" is a serious one : it should stay on the table , if only to provide a wake - up call to the Karzai government .
Only by threatening to cut the government of Afghanistan completely loose from US combat and military support – and by having it look deep into the abyss , to realize what defeat by the Taliban would really mean – will Karzai and his allies have any incentive to get serious about fighting the Taliban and governing the country properly .
Any more than a token presence of US troops will perpetuate this culture of dependency and stop this reckoning from occurring .
It would also allow the Karzai government to limp on with its half - hearted war against the Taliban indefinitely , as the Afghan people continue to suffer .
If the Afghan government is to survive , it needs to take up its own fight , rather than continually looking over its shoulder for American support , and blaming the American forces when things go wrong .
It is now time for the US to look seriously at the zero option and to develop plans for removing all combat troops , except for a small special operations force to target exclusively on the 100 or so surviving al - Qaida operatives remaining .
However many Americans remain there , the war against the Taliban needs to be President Karzai 's from 2014 onwards , and the consequences of failure should be owned by him .
After more than 2,156 US troops killed and 18,109 wounded ( pdf ) since 2001 , and more than $ 590bn given in aid , it is time to call an end to America 's war in Afghanistan .
With such losses , it is hard to accept that the US war in Afghanistan will end without a decisive victory , but keeping substantial American troops present in the country indefinitely will confer no real political or strategic advantages – while risking death and injury to even more young Americans ."
2013-01-11,"Barack Obama was meeting the Afghan president Hamid Karzai on Friday , in an attempt to pin down arrangements for Afghanistan after the formal withdrawal of US and other coalition forces at the end of next year .
Relations between the two have long been difficult , and the White House meeting is the first conversation since the autumn , a long gap given that the US is still at war and American troops are still taking casualties .
The main issue to be resolved is how many US troops will be left in Afghanistan after 2014 .
US officials have suggested between 3,000 and 9,000 .
One official , reflecting frustration with America 's lack of progress in Afghanistan , even suggested all US forces might be pulled out .
The outgoing US defence secretary Leon Panetta , speaking at a press conference on Thursday , refused to discuss figures and said no option had been taken from the table .
But Panetta hinted the US was not about to totally abandon Afghanistan after 2014 , describing as "" enduring "" the relationship between the two countries .
"" We have poured a lot of blood and treasure into this war .
We have made a lot of progress as a result of sacrifice by our people , and we 're not gon na walk backward , "" he said .
The US has 66,000 troops in Afghanistan and other Nato forces 34,000 .
Most are to be withdrawn by the end of 2014 .
The US attempted to negotiate a similar post - war deal in Iraq to leave a small force behind , but failed to reach agreement with the Iraqi government .
Although relations with Karzai have been testy , the chances of a deal are higher , mainly because the Afghanistan government is keen to have US troops continuing to bolster Afghan forces .
Karzai 's visits to Washington in the past have been unpredictable affairs .
He has portrayed himself as a grateful ally at White House and other official engagements , but given speeches and press interviews elsewhere expressing hostile comments about his hosts .
The Obama administration has at times shown its frustration in public and at others times dismissed Karzai 's comments as intended for internal Afghanistan consumption ."
2013-01-11,"Barack Obama and Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai came close to sealing a deal at the White House on Friday that would keep a small US force in the country after the pullout of most international forces at the end of 2014 .
Obama also hinted that that pullout may be accelerated , citing a speedier than predicted handover to Afghanistan security forces this spring . ""
That does n't mean that coalition forces , including US forces , are no longer fighting .
They will still be fighting alongside Afghan troops , "" Obama said .
"" It does mean , though , that Afghans will have taken the lead , and our presence , the nature of our work , will be different .
We will be in a training , assisting , advising role .
"" There are 66,000 US troops and 33,000 Nato and other international forces left in Afghanistan .
An early return of troops , with only a vestige of the force left behind in 2014 , would be popular in the US where there is little enthusiasm – or , in some cases , even interest – in the war .
Visits by Karzai to Washington in the past have been fractious , and Obama looked tired on Friday after hours of negotiation .
But both men made sufficient concessions to pave the way for a bilateral security agreement to keep US troops in Afghanistan post-2014 .
No agreement was reached on the precise number , with estimates ranging from between 3,000 to 9,000 .
A deal with Afghanistan would contrast with Iraq , where Obama was criticised for failing to secure a deal to retain a military presence in the country after formal withdrawal .
Republicans , in particular , saw this as scant reward for US involvement in Iraq .
The sticking point for the US , which pulled the last of its forces from Iraq in December 2011 , was the refusal of the Iraqi government to guarantee immunity from prosecution for American forces stationed in the country – and this issue cropped up again with Karzai .
As part of the negotiations , Karzai managed to wring from Obama a series of concessions , including a faster timetable for withdrawal of international forces from Afghan villages , their presence being a frequent source of tension .
He also secured the transfer of Afghan detainees held by international forces to Afghanistan government control .
Karzai , in a fairly emollient mood compared with some previously testy visits to Washington , told the White House press conference : "" With those issues resolved , I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for US troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised , Afghan law will not be compromised . "" Obama , at the press conference , was anxious to emphasise that US involvement in Afghanistan was winding down . ""
Starting this spring our troops will have a different mission – training , advising and assisting Afghan forces .
By the end of next year –
2014 – the transition will be complete .
This war will come to a responsible end , "" Obama said .
Asked if the war had been worth it , Obama opted for a few minutes of reflection . ""
Have we achieved everything that some might have imagined us achieving in the best of scenarios ?
Probably not .
This is a human enterprise and you fall short of the ideal .
"" Did we achieve our central goal , and have we been able to shape a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan government that is willing to cooperate with us to make sure that it is not a launching pad for future attacks against the United States ?
We have achieved that goal .
We are in the process of achieving that goal .
"" Karzai has been resistant in the past to entering into negotiations with the Taliban , a course advocated by Washington .
But Karzai gave ground at the White House , confirming on Friday the long - awaited opening of a Taliban office in Doha to facilitate negotiations .
Obama views the role the US role after 2014 as minimal , the job of small force left behind as simply to advise , train and assist Afghanistan forces in battling al - Qaida and affiliated groups .
"" It is a very limited mission .
It is not one that would require the same kind of footprint obviously that we have had over the last 10 years in Afghanistan . ""
He confirmed his main concern was to secure immunity for US troops post-2014 . ""
President Karzai 's primary concern … is making sure Afghan sovereignty is respected .
If we have a follow - on force of any sort past 2014 , it has to be at the invitation of the Afghan government and they have to feel comfortable with it .
"" I will say , and have said to President Karzai , that we have arrangements like this with countries all around the world , and nowhere do we have any security agreements with a country without immunity agreements for our troops . ""
Obama added : "" It will not be possible for us to have any kind of US troop presence post-2014 without assurances that our men and women operating there are somehow subject to the jurisdiction of another country . ""
Karzai , in response , signalled he would comply . ""
The bilateral security agreement is in the interest of both countries .
We understand the issue of immunity is of very specific importance for the United States , as was for us the issues of sovereignty and detentions and the continued presence of international forces in Afghan villages and the very conduct of the war itself , "" he said , adding these had all been satisfactorily resolved .
One of the issues that has caused the US and other international governments engaged in Afghanistan the most angst is the high level of corruption .
Asked at the press conference , Karzai remained vague , acknowledging that there is corruption in Afghanistan and that the government was involved .
Progress had been made in combating it , Karzai said , but he was not satisfed .
Asked about a promise to protect women 's rights , Obama was unequivocal . ""
The Afghan constitution protects the rights of Afghan women .
And the United States strongly believes that Afghanistan can not succeed unless it gives opportunity to its women .
We believe that about every country in the world . ""
And so we will continue to voice very strongly support for the Afghan constitution , its protection of minorities , its protection of women .
And we think that a failure to provide that protection not only will make reconciliation impossible to achieve , but also would make Afghanistan 's long - term development impossible to achieve . ""
Karzai restricted his response to : ""
Indeed .
Indeed . """
2013-01-14,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has asked Washington to give his country drones and universities to replace the soldiers it has stationed there now , and said he will let the Afghan people decide whether a small contingent of US troops could stay on after most leave in 2014 .
Karzai seemed upbeat and relaxed on his return from a trip to Washington to meet Barack Obama , smiling , laughing , and even describing the pleasant sound of a flag fluttering on his official car in a news conference broadcast live on national TV .
The Afghan leader has been as vocal in demanding continued US spending in his impoverished country as he has been with concerns about the presence of US troops on the ground .
But he apparently returned pleased with agreements over long - term supplies and funding , and with hints of a speeded - up withdrawal of US forces .
He said : "" We should n't think that when foreigners leave our country that we are not capable of protecting it ...
We do n't want the US soldiers present in Afghanistan but we want their economic support .
"" Afghanistan will need help with soldiers ' salaries and military hardware for many years to come , if its army is to have any hope of holding off the Taliban .
Karzai said he was confident Washington would share even advanced technology with his country .
"" We asked them to give us drones , and they agreed and promised them to us , "" he said , detailing the outcome of the trip and adding that he wanted more foreign cash for education as well .
"" We asked the Americans to make universities in eight zones . ""
He dismissed fears that violence would spread as foreign troops headed home , leaving behind Afghan forces heavily dependent on recent recruits and short on key capacities ranging from air power and heavy artillery to intelligence gathering and bomb disposal .
"" When foreigners leave , Afghanistan will never become unsafe ; it will become safer , "" he said , underlining his oft - repeated view that Nato forces on the ground are a lightning rod for violence .
Karzai had gone to meet Obama with a long list of demands and an aggressive delegation ; his chief of staff told the Washington Post just before the trip : "" The world needs us more than we need them . ""
After hours of negotiations , the two presidents came close to sealing a deal that would keep a small US force in the country to train Afghan soldiers and pursue al - Qaida and similar groups after the pullout of Nato combat troops at the end of 2014 .
Karzai said he would call a traditional loya jirga gathering of influential Afghans from around the country to decide whether US forces could be granted immunity from prosecution in the country , which is a red line for Washington .
Iraq 's refusal to agree to this term precipitated the US military departure from the country in 2011 , and without it no US soldiers will stay in Afghanistan .
"" The Afghan government can not make that decision .
It is the decision of the people of Afghanistan , "" Karzai said .
"" So a loya jirga of the people of Afghanistan should decide . ""
The US embassy did not respond to a request for comment on his remarks .

2013-01-24,"John Kerry , who is shortly expected to be confirmed as the next US secretary of state , has warned that Afghanistan must hold a legitimate presidential election next year or risk being totally abandoned by western governments after the withdrawal of foreign combat forces is complete in 2014 .
Kerry said in his nomination hearing before the Senate foreign relations committee that he had played a role in helping Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , hold on to power despite a tainted election victory , and that it could not be allowed to happen again .
In a broad - ranging , three - hour hearing , Kerry also warned that "" China is all over Africa "" and said that the US needed to exert new influence on the continent .
He spoke passionately about the need for international cooperation to battle climate change , saying that countries should not be afraid of responding to it , but of not doing so .
Kerry also warned that battles between the president and Congress over debt , budgets and other finances were damaging the US 's standing in the world . ""
Foreign policy is economic policy , "" he said .
"" It is urgent that we show people in the rest of the world that we can get our business done in an effective and timely way . ""
Most senators on the foreign relations committee were fulsome in their praise of Kerry , who is himself a senator and more usually chairman of the same committee .
Leading Republicans , such as John McCain , endorsed his nomination and said they expected he would be swiftly confirmed as secretary of state by the full Senate .
Kerry was asked several times about the looming US military withdrawal from Afghanistan – although the largest American civilian overseas operation will remain – and what can be done to create stability .
He warned that "" there can not be an effective peace "" without hanging on to "" the gains "" which include constitutional government , the rights of women and girls and their role in Afghan society .
Kerry said that a central factor in stabilising Afghanistan would be ensuring that next year 's presidential election is legitimate , after the tainted process which put Karzai back in power . ""
Having an acceptable election –
it 's not going to be perfect , we 're not going to be able to have perfection in this process for a lot of different reasons – but having an election that passes muster and is acceptable according to international standards and observers will be critical to our ability to have the kind of transition we want to have , and to have confidence that the government that succeeds in 2014 has legitimacy , "" he said .
"" If it does n't have legitimacy , if we do n't succeed in that effort , it 's going to be very , very difficult to convince the American people , and to convince our allies in ISAF and beyond , to stay engaged in this effort . ""
Kerry acknowledged that he had helped win recognition for Karzai 's questionable victory in the last presidential ballot .
"" I went through this personally with President Karzai in the last election where there were serious questions about the propriety of the process and we had to sort of strike a compromise about it , "" he said .
"" I do n't think they 'll be room for a compromise in the aftermath here .
I will certainly make sure that we 're riding herd on it very very closely . ""
Kerry said that in the face of budget cuts in the US , it was important to maintain funding for overseas policies that strengthen the American economy .
He flagged up the rapidly growing influence of Chinese businesses in Africa .
"" China is all over Africa , "" he said .
"" I mean all over Africa .
And they 're buying up long - term contracts on minerals , you name it .
There are some places where we 're not in the game , folks .
I hate to say it .
We 've got to get in it .
But it takes a little bit of resourcing .
Believe me , somebody 's paying for those folks [ the Chinese ] to be over there , investing in their investment of time .
"" We have to be prepared because I think that what we bring to the table is frankly a lot more attractive than what a lot of other countries bring to the table .
People like to do business with American businesses .
They think we 're open , we 're accountable , we have freedom of creativity .
"" I think that if we can organise ourselves in this sector we can win .
And when I say win , I do n't mean win on Cold War terms .
I mean win in terms of business contracts , business opportunities , jobs for Americans , ability to export .
"" Kerry was asked about a range of Middle East issues .
He said the US was working on how to hasten the fall of President Bashar Assad in Syria .
"" We need to change Bashar Assad 's calculation , "" he said .
"" Right now President Assad does n't think he 's losing and the opposition thinks it 's winning .
That is not an equation that allows you to reach some accommodation for transition .
The goal of the Obama administration , I think the goal of the international community , is to effect some kind of orderly transition .
"" We have to increase the readiness of president to see the die is cast , the handwriting is on the wall , to be willing to make a judgement here that will save lives and hold the state together in a transition . ""
Kerry mostly repeated the administration 's line on Iran 's nuclear programme and the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
He warned the Palestinians against taking Israel to the International Criminal Court .
In recent days , the Palestinian leadership has said it will ask the ICC to investigate whether Jewish settlements in the West Bank breach the laws of war , if Israel continues to expand its colonies in the occupied territories .
Republican senator for Kentucky Rand Paul pressed Kerry on why the US is still sending weapons to Egypt after its first elected president , Mohamed Morsi , was revealed to have said that Jews are descended from apes and pigs .
Kerry said Morsi 's comments were "" reprehensible , degrading and unacceptable "" and said he should apologise .
But Kerry added that it was important to maintain good relations with the Egyptian leader , in part to help preserve the Israeli - Egyptian peace accord .
Paul also challenged Kerry on whether the president has the authority to unilaterally make war , as Barack Obama did in Libya , noting the nominee 's opposition to the US bombing of Cambodia ordered by President Richard Nixon during the Vietnam war .
In 1971 , Kerry gave evidence to the Senate foreign relations committee after returning from a tour of duty in Vietnam .
Paul said the constitution did not give the president the power to make war .
Kerry responded that congressional approval "" just does n't work in some instances "" .
"" There are occasions where the president of the United States has to make a decision immediately , "" he said .
Kerry cited the invasions of Grenada and Panama , saying he supported both military interventions although they appeared to be poor examples as neither required an urgent decision by the president that required him to bypass Congress .
Paul pressed Kerry on whether there was a difference between Nixon 's bombing of Cambodia and Obama ordering the assault on Libya .
Kerry said Cambodia was different .
"" It is because it was an extension of a war that was prosecuted without the involvement of Congress after a number of years , "" he said ."
2013-02-03,"It has been more than a decade since Hamid Karzai , whose job a US diplomat described as the most difficult in the world , took a holiday .
But the man once hailed in the west as the suave , stylish embodiment of a new Afghanistan will be taking a long rest next year when he steps down as president of his fractured and impoverished country .
The Afghan constitution does not allow him to run in another election .
Nato - led forces are also due to leave at the end of 2014 , so the country will face the future without the leader and the foreign military presence that have defined much of the last decade .
"" It is true that I have n't taken a holiday .
I have n't noticed that I have n't taken a holiday , "" he told the Guardian and ITN in an exclusive interview in London , where he joked that the seven - hour flight to the UK was enough of a rest for now .
"" I 'll be taking a long holiday a year from now . ""
Of course I have felt the strain , of course one needs time off
but it depends on whether one can afford it or not .
I feel I can not afford it , I feel I should continue to work for another year and then take a good leave and recuperate . ""
Karzai took power as a temporary leader after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , then won two successive presidential polls , in 2004 and 2009 .
Charming , clever , and fluent in Pashtu , Dari , English and Urdu , he made Esquire magazine 's list of best - dressed men in 2004 , and seemed at home anywhere from the remotest corners of Afghanistan to western capitals .
Tall and energetic , wrapped in a traditional Afghan chapan robe of woven blue , green and purple silk , and wearing a karakul cap of silver lamb 's fleece , Karzai has a charisma and focus that cut through lingering jetlag and a cold .
That personality has helped him build relationships with everyone from Prince Charles – whom he describes as a "" very fine gentlemen "" – to the senior council of Afghan clerics who recently ruled that women were "" secondary "" to men .
But there is a steely edge beneath the mannered exterior , and a strong nationalist sentiment , forged in part through years fighting the Soviets and then the Taliban , which brought him into conflict with western countries supporting his government financially and with troops .
He objected to much about the military presence as it escalated over the last decade , from night raids on Afghan homes to the creation of militia - like local police .
Meanwhile , diplomats were also cooling on the relationship , and Karzai earned a reputation as erratic , emotional and prone to believing paranoid conspiracy theories , according to leaked US diplomatic cables .
Ties were perhaps irretrievably damaged during the 2009 presidential elections , which were marred by allegations of massive fraud , when Karzai felt western allies were trying to remove him from power .
His critics now describe him as an obstructive protector of corrupt relatives and cronies , pointing to a brother in the southern city of Kandahar who , before he was assassinated , was alleged to have links to drug traffickers , and another who was a shareholder in a bank that nearly collapsed under $ 900 m ( £ 560 m ) of bad loans .
He is politically astute and has outmanoeuvred many of the western military commanders and ambassadors who traipsed through the imposing stone entrance of his palace fort over the last decade , helped perhaps by the fact that they came and went while he stayed put to watch many repeat their predecessors ' mistakes .
Ryan Crocker , former US ambassador to Kabul , described Karzai 's job as the most difficult in the world ; it is certainly one of the most dangerous .
All but one of the men who have ruled Afghanistan since the king was deposed in the 1970s has met an unnatural end .
Several were killed by their successors .
Karzai has said he will not leave Afghanistan after he steps down , which means the question of who takes over could be one of life or death for him , although he says he is not worried .
"" I do n't feel any danger at all , none .
I am in my country , and safe and sound , "" he said .
The death toll from the years of war that have convulsed Afghanistan includes his father , his brother and many friends , colleagues and political allies and rivals .
He has survived at least four assassination attempts since taking power , with security tightening each time .
Controls at the vast fortified palace where he lives are now so strict that visitors below ministerial rank are not even allowed to keep their pens , getting standard - issue ballpoints once they have checked in their belongings and passed several body searches .
Karzai rarely leaves the palace , and when he does he usually travels by aeroplane or helicopter , even across the capital .
But he shrugged off the security constraints .
"" I have seen a lot more protection elsewhere , "" he said when asked about life as possibly the world 's most heavily guarded head of state .
"" That danger is always there in life .
In Afghanistan it 's there in one way , in the west in lots of other ways .
"" Accidents are part of life .
So no , I do n't feel fear .
Danger is there
but I am not afraid of it . ""
He has fiercely protected his family 's privacy , perhaps for security or perhaps haunted by the memories of a previous ruler penalised for setting a liberal example by encouraging his wife to wear western clothes and uncover her head .
His wife , a doctor who once worked in tough refugee camps in Pakistan , has not made a public appearance for years .
A picture that allegedly showed his young son playing with a tame deer was spread across Afghan Twitter and Facebook pages within hours by people fascinated by the possible glimpse of the first family .
Karzai set diplomatic circles in Kabul buzzing last year when he named his first daughter Malalai , a popular Afghan name but also that of a heroine of the 19th - century fight against the British , with whom his government has had a strained relationship .
He fought the Soviets and then the Taliban while brothers were running restaurants in the US , but unlike many of the commanders who have supported him and held senior positions in his governments – from army chief of staff , provincial governors and ministers to first vice - president – he has no military power base .
He says his decade - long efforts have not been for personal gain – he reportedly earns $ 525 a month – but for the good of the country .
"" It 's my country , we have to build it .
Look how long it took you to build Britain into the good country that it is today .
Someone did a great work there in the past , someone sacrificed , perhaps millions of people did hard work for centuries to bring you to where you are .
"" Afghanistan has to do the same , he said .
"" Every citizen of Afghanistan has to work hard .
And I , as the president of Afghanistan , have to be at the frontline of that hardship and hard work . ""

Constitution will prevent him standing again"
2013-02-04,"Q :
President , thank you very much for talking to us , it 's an honour for us .
British and coalition troops are preparing for a long pullout .
It 's a time of transition .
Transitions are often risky times , dangerous times , and some people are predicting a very dangerous period ahead for Afghanistan .
What risks do you think lie ahead for Afghanistan ?
Is this a dangerous moment ?
A :
Transition of course has difficulties , of course as far as the abilities of the Afghan state are concerned .
We are a newly rebuilding state of all the institutions that any state would need to make it run .
That rebuilding has been going on now for 10 years , some with tremendously good success , some relatively all right .
In areas where we began late , of course , this progress has to take some more years to come , the stability of institutions would take some more years to come .
But that is not our concern , nor am I or the majority of Afghan people concerned about the end state of the transition , we will be fine .
The important element for that state of being fine , for stability in Afghanistan , for continued progress in Afghanistan , even of the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan , is the good intention of our neighbours and the well - planned and of course also well - intentioned exit of foreign forces and the staying elements of those foreign forces in Afghanistan in the form of strategic agreements and eventually the – how should I put it ?
–
the continued stay of the United States forces in Afghan facilities .
So those elements will determine how stable and strong we are .
On our own , as Afghans , we will be good .
It 's the external factors that will determine the extent of progress and stability or the lack of it .
But it 's a period full of risk , the next 18 months ?
Indeed , as any other social , political exercise , we will have our difficulties , we will have our challenges , but our challenges , our difficulties will not translate into instability .
They will be challenges like we all have in our societies , we must overcome it .
I am not concerned about stability .
The instability , or difficulty , will be more external than internal to us , and that 's what we are working on , that 's why we are here in London for the tripartite [ meeting with the UK prime minister , David Cameron , and the Pakistani president , Asif Ali Zardari ] today and tomorrow .
For years we heard that British , American , coalition troops would pull out when the time was right , when there was stability , when there was security , because not to do so would be a betrayal , would be wrong .
And yet troops are pulling out , and there is no , hand on heart
, there 's no complete security , there 's no total stability .
This is a strange situation and , again , full of risk .
Well , it depends on the purposes we all have .
The international community , led by the United States , came to Afghanistan in the aftermath of 9/11 .
And with an objective to fight terrorism , and to secure the west and the United States , by extension , from Afghanistan .
Now that they have planned to leave , it is perhaps in the western capitals
they have concluded that they are more secure , that terrorism is on defeat , that also in Afghanistan there is n't a terrorism to fight , therefore they are leaving .
The other side could be that they have felt that there was no fight in Afghanistan from the very first day , that terrorism was not in Afghanistan to be found , that they had to go to the [ Taliban 's ] sanctuaries long time back , that they did n't do that and since they can not do that even today there is no point for them to stay in Afghanistan , so they would like to leave , but stay a residual force behind to continue to provide stability and training to the Afghan forces .
In any case we respect the decision of our partners to leave in bulk , and to provide Afghanistan resources enough to look after itself , and that 's a good situation for us all .
It 's good for the west and our allies , because that spares them a lot of resources and money .
It 's good for us because , after all , it 's our country , and we have to protect it and provide for it .
Given the help , we 'll be happier and better able to do it .
But they are not leaving with the job done , are they , because there is no security , there is no stability ?
Depends on how one defines the job done .
As I explained earlier , in the first part of the question , it 's either of the two , they feel fulfilled with regard to the objective of fighting terrorism and weakening al - Qaida , or they feel that they were fighting in the wrong place , in the first place , so they should discontinue doing that and leave .
We in Afghanistan are not so much into whether they have succeeded or failed , the international forces , we in Afghanistan are more into bringing an end to the three decades of suffering of the Afghan people , in one name or another , for one so - called cause or another .
And we want the foreign forces to leave our villages , to leave our towns and homes , we do n't want our civilians to face guns any more .
But we want a relationship with our allies in a manner that will keep us in their help , and that will also enable us to defend and provide for our country better than we can do on our own , alone .
You want to see the gun removed from Afghan life , but even when the British , when the American , when the coalition troops go , there is little sign at the moment that the Taliban will lay down their weapons .
Is there any real hope of reconciliation with the Taliban , is there any hope of a political solution ?
Left to Afghan devices , yes .
Left to Afghans , with Afghans , yes .
Left to an intra - Afghan dialogue between the Taliban and the Afghan peace council , yes .
Together with external factors , it 's a bit more complicated , and that 's the element we are trying to work out .
With Pakistan , for example ?
With Pakistan , with the United States , with our other neighbours and the players that we have , the region as a whole .
But the Taliban seem in no mood to have reconciliation talks with you .
A lot of the Taliban want to see you dead .
Well , they may want me dead personally , but there are thousands of Taliban and Taliban leaders who are in contact with us , who want to talk to their fellow Afghans , who recognise that that 's the only way forward .
Now I have heard statements , in the name of the Taliban , that they do n't want to talk to the Afghan government or the Afghan high peace council .
We do n't see those statements as coming from the Taliban per se , we see those statements as having been spoken in the name of the Taliban , but are not factually Taliban statements , we know that .
The Taliban are being used ?
In a manner of speaking , yes .
The name of the Taliban is used .
But they are still a force to be reckoned with .
Do you expect their attacks to grow as British and American coalition troops pull out , that they will increase the pace , the spectaculars that we sometimes see in Kabul ?
From the Afghan Taliban
no , definitely not .
From those Taliban who are Afghans , or inside Afghanistan , who have a motivation against foreign forces for reasons of religion , or other reasons , and those who have been affected by events in Afghanistan , and for its sake have taken up again , the exit of foreign forces will not bring more violence for them to perpetrate against their own people , but a serious , strong , good reduction in violence will occur .
But from the external forces acting in the name of the Taliban , we will have to wait and see .
Just to go back to Britain and its legacy in Afghanistan .
There was news last week that an agricultural park , which was meant to provide farmers with an alternative to growing poppy , to growing that which would fuel the drug industry , has closed .
Britain has put millions into it .
It was promised that there would be 4,500 jobs .
It 's closed .
Not a single major infrastructure project has been funded by Britain , even the Kajaki dam , the third turbine , remains unused .
You must be very disappointed really with the legacy that Britain will leave behind when its final troops pull out .
Well I 'm not aware of a farm , whether there ever was a project on the cards by the British government .
But I am aware that the British government was among the first governments that began providing funds directly to the Afghan government , so they have had a contribution to enabling Afghanistan to spend its resources , or the money that is being given to us directly , better , and more accountably .
Britain has had that contribution .
Britain is establishing a Sandhurst - style school for military training in Kabul , and a lot more that Britain has done , we are thankful for that .
Of course , Kajaki dam is not a British project , it 's an American project , and it has not happened so far , much to our disappointment .
It could have been done had it been given to Afghans to complete .
But Britain 's role at this point is highly valued in the pursuit that it has for the peace process in Afghanistan and for bringing Afghanistan and Pakistan together in a close dialogue for improved relations , and towards , hopefully , once the ground is ready and our friends in Pakistan give us that ground , that platform to stand on , for a strategic partnership between Afghanistan and Pakistan to take place .
Britain is playing a significant role .
Do you think Pakistan has really had a genuine change of heart about supporting or promoting peace in Afghanistan , because in the past you have been quite critical about their intentions .
And as a part of that , we 've seen a lot of reports about progress on talking about talks , meeting with the Taliban , but do you think that in the next few months we could see the beginning of actual talks rather than talks about talks ?
Yes .
We are already , by the way , talking to the Taliban , there is contact between us , significant contact going on , away from international eyes of course .
Whether Pakistan has a change of heart , well , Pakistan is suffering in ways a lot more than we in Afghanistan are suffering , there are daily attacks in Pakistan , on Pakistani soldiers , on Pakistani civilians .
Schools are closed , I was reading the other day that only in areas close to the Afghan border and around the city of Peshawar , 800 schools were shut or destroyed by the militants , by the Taliban in Pakistan , or in the name of the Taliban in Pakistan .
So Pakistan indeed should , or must , find it absolutely necessary for survival , to begin to address the question of extremism and terrorism and to begin to improve relations with Afghanistan , as two sovereign , good neighbourly countries .
Just to follow up on the talks , obviously there have been these contacts about setting up the office , about how talks might begin , but these are the preliminaries to actual peace negotiations of some kind .
Do you think those actual talks might start , could we see your government and the Taliban sitting down at a table together to talk about peace within months ?
Within weeks ?
Nothing has really happened so far as talks are concerned between us and the Taliban where the central piece is the Qatar office , the Doha office .
From that perspective , not much has happened and we hope something will happen .
But other than that , the talks between Afghans , the Afghan - to - Afghan talks , that is going on for quite some time between us and the Taliban .
But that will not produce the results that we need , because if it were for us , the Afghans , the Taliban and the rest of Afghans to talk , we would have reached results a long time back .
It is the external factors that are important here .
And in the Doha talks , in the office for the Taliban in Doha , we are actually thinking more of the external elements there involved in talks with us for a result - oriented negotiation than anything else .
So that 's the purpose there .
In other words , there will not be peace in Afghanistan by having an agreement only between us and the Afghan Taliban .
Peace will only come when the external elements involved in creating instability and fighting , or lawlessness in Afghanistan , are involved in talks and have reached agreements with Afghanistan , whether directly with us or somehow through the name of the Taliban .
And what is the likelihood of that ?
The likelihood ?
If I were to say I was very optimistic , it would n't be right , but I am a lot better positioned to speak optimistically today than I could , say , a year ago .
Can I ask about British troops in Helmand ?
You were quoted saying in 2008 : "" Why do we have Taliban controlling these areas when two years ago I was in control .
When Sher Mohammad Akhunzada was governor we had girls in schools and only 160 foreign troops .
""
Do you think the heavy Isaf [ International Security Assistance Force ] presence that we have seen in Helmand over the last six years has been a positive thing for the people who live there ?
Factually , what I said then was true , and it remains to be true today .
In 2002 through 2006 , Afghanistan had a lot better security .
When we had our own presence there , with very little foreign troops , schools were open in Helmand and life was more secure .
But I am not going to blame , and it should not be seen as such , I do n't want to be interpreted as saying that the arrival of foreign troops brought less security or worsened security for us .
Whatever happened is the past , and now we are looking forward to the future .
We appreciate the sacrifices of the British forces and the contributions that they have made , we appreciate the sacrifices of all other foreign forces in Afghanistan , and we also would like our allies in the west to recognise the immense sacrifices of the Afghan people in the last 10 years , the immense loss of life and the suffering that the Afghan people put up with .
And from that perspective , from that recognition , we should move forwards towards the peace process and towards the establishment of partnerships as we have now with Britain and others , and to bring success by making it tangible for the Afghan people to see and touch .
But in Helmand and other places , things could have been done so very differently ?
I would fully agree with you on that , yes .
And indeed in the whole of the country .
Principally what ?
Well , money could have been better spent , there could have been a lot less corruption , in Afghanistan .
So often in the past many years the Afghan government was blamed for corruption .
I knew , not in the beginning , but later as I looked into the question more deeply , I knew that yes , we had corruption in the Afghan government system , in the delivery of services .
But that was , in comparison to the corruption coming through the international donor contracts , and the way the money was spent , really insignificant .
So money could have been spent better .
Money could have been spent on infrastructurally important projects for our economic sustainability , and for a lot more work in Afghanistan .
And militarily things could have been done so very differently .
You 've been very critical of night raids , of special forces operations in Helmand , in Kandahar ?
Absolutely , that was one of the most difficult aspects of our relationship with the United States in particular .
Britain , by the way , did a lot better there , listened to us , had much better behaviour , together with Germany .
But with the United States we had a serious difficulty with regard to night raids and civilian casualties , which has now improved after much work .
I only wish that this could have been done easier and earlier .
The United States has been talking about leaving a residual force in Afghanistan , but they have also said there is the "" zero option "" , a complete pullout , leaving no troops behind at all .
You would welcome , would n't you , the idea that there would be no foreign troops whatsoever at the end of next year ?
Well that 's utopian state of mind , and we wish to have that utopian state of mind ,
that 's ideal , no doubt , why would n't I , or why would n't any citizen of a country , want no troops on our side ?
There 's a but coming ?
There 's a but coming , and the but part is that we have been in a process of undermining – rather , seeing the destruction of Afghanistan for the past 30 years , under various garbs , under various slogans , under various circumstances .
Afghanistan needs to rebuild itself , to rebuild the times of its youth , to rebuild our human capital , to rebuild our infrastructure , to rebuild state institutions , especially those institutions that will provide protection to the population and defend the country .
For that we need the presence of the international community with us , our allies .
Now our allies have interests too , and part of those interests are having some force left in Afghanistan , having the use of Afghan facilities , which we recognise also brings much good to Afghanistan .
But we like to do this in a manner that will make sure Afghan interests are kept in mind and handled well while we provide the facilities to our friends , and the permit to station some forces in Afghanistan .
So it 's good for us in short , and I do n't think there is a zero option .
Zero option would be a failure , not success .
The international community spent tens of billions of dollars of aid in Afghanistan , but among my reporting in recent months has been a story about acute malnutrition in southern Afghanistan , children dying of cold in northern Afghanistan .
It remains one of the poorest countries in the world .
Do you think that money from the west has been well spent ?
Has there been value both for Afghans and the western citizens who have paid that money in taxes ?
The western assistance in Afghanistan on education and health was well spent , largely well spent .
The western assistance in Afghanistan on providing us the basics of infrastructure and electricity and water management , and in providing for proper use of our water resources , has not been well spent .
Western assistance to Afghanistan in other areas has not been well spent .
But the fact that we are a poor country remains to be true , but it would not have changed even if all the money that the west brought to Afghanistan was spent well in our country , we would still have remained a poor country .
The question of malnutrition in children , in all other issues , it 's not only a question of lack of economic means , but also lack of overall development – lack of education , our cultural environment , our lack of access to health clinics , difficulty to travel from place to place .
So all of those combined gave us this difficulty , money immediately will not relieve you of those problems , but time and well - planned economic activity will relieve you of that problem .
Just following up on the issue of the Taliban 's external support .
You raised in 2009 the question of reports that mystery helicopters were ferrying the Taliban to northern Afghanistan .
Obviously Pakistan does n't have helicopters inside Afghanistan .
Can you talk a little about the kind of support you think the Taliban are getting from beyond Pakistan , and is that still an issue ?
Well , we were talking mainly of our neighbours when it comes to large support that the Taliban receive .
The question of helicopters inside Afghanistan ferrying Taliban from one place to another will make it a lot more closer to ourselves and our allies , and I do n't want to go into that discussion now that there is a process of withdrawal , now that there is talk of transition and strategic partnership .
Can I ask you about an issue that is very sensitive here .
Many coalition troops , British and American troops , have been killed recently in so - called insider attacks where their Afghan colleagues have turned on them .
What are you , what is your army , doing to try to stop insider attacks ?
This is a very important issue and one that unfortunately has happened , and has pained us and pained our allies .
We have a responsibility to protect our allies , who are actually guests in our country , so we see this as a serious breach of hospitality , that we are known for in the world , and that we have to improve and make better .
So this is an important question , and we are working on it .
In what way ?
What can you do practically to stop it ?
In lots of ways , we should find out the reasons .
We know some of the reasons .
We try our best to train our troops better , to inform them better , and also there has to be a lot more cultural sensitisation by our allies when they send troops to Afghanistan .
Plus much more .
Prince Harry has just left Afghanistan , and when he was there he did interviews in which he spoke of killing Taliban .
You may have heard some of the words he used and the way he expressed himself .
Do you think the words he used , or the way he expressed himself , do you think Prince Harry spoke rather unwisely ?
Well , Prince Charles , the father of Prince Harry , is a very fine gentleman , a man for whom I have tremendous respect .
For years , even when I was a student in Simla , I used to read about his dislike of modern architecture and the cement buildings and I entirely agreed with him .
Prince Charles is a great representative of Britain and the British ways of life .
Prince Harry is a young man , we do give exits to young men when they make mistakes .
Were you upset about how he expressed his days and weeks of service there ?
Well , as I said , he 's a young man , and young men do make mistakes talking , while behaving , all of us have gone through that period , so let 's drop it there .
This is a dangerous moment , a time of transition .
Do you fear for your life in the months ahead ?
Well , I 've had dangers come to me in the past as well , before I was the president , when we were fighting the Soviets , when I was fighting – rather I should say struggling against the Taliban , and since I 've been the president .
That danger is always there in life .
In Afghanistan it 's in one way , in the west it 's in lots of other ways .
Accidents are part of life .
So no , I do n't feel fear .
Danger is there , but I am not afraid of it .
It comes with the job ?
It comes with life .
Of course , in our case it is a lot closer , but danger is part of life , and part of work .
And in our case it 's closer to us than perhaps to others .
But in Afghan history , when foreign forces have pulled out , presidents are very vulnerable .
Well it 's very different this time .
In that sense , no , I do n't feel any danger at all , none .
I am in my country , and safe and sound .
What is it like being president of Afghanistan for 12 years ?
I understand you have n't had a holiday in all that time , you 're probably the most heavily guarded head of state ?
I do n't think so
, I have seen a lot more protection elsewhere .
How do you manage living with that kind of pressure .
Why do you make those sacrifices ?
It 's my country , we have to build it .
Look how long it took you to build Britain to the good country that it is today .
Someone did a great work there in the past , someone sacrificed , perhaps millions of people did the hard work for centuries to bring you where you are .
Afghanistan needs to do the same .
Every citizen of Afghanistan has to work hard .
And I , as the president of Afghanistan , have to be at the frontline of that hardship and hard work .
Where do you see Afghanistan in 10 years , not talking about the immediate transition ?
Ten years from today Afghanistan will be twice or three times better than what it is today , a better economy , a more educated population , a youth rising in higher standards of education , stronger institutions and a country that 's much safer and better off than it is today .
Of course it will not be rich by western standards , but it will be more well off than it is today .
And what is the biggest risk that could prevent Afghanistan getting to that point ?
The risk is continuation of foreign interference and lack of recognition by Afghans ourselves , the Afghans , to take the opportunity and move forward , that risk in Afghanistan as far as we are concerned is much less .
We have recognised our mistakes in the past and we know that a good future lies ahead of us , but we need to work for it , and work hard for it .
And is it true that in your working hard for it , you have n't taken a holiday for 12 years ?
It is true that I have n't taken a holiday , yes .
I have n't noticed that I have n't taken a holiday .
I 'll be taking a long holiday a year from now .
You have n't felt any strain from 10 years without a break ?
Of course I have felt the strain , of course one needs time off , but it depends on whether one can afford it or not .
I feel I can not afford it , I feel I should continue to work for another year and then take a good leave and recuperate ."
2013-02-04,
2013-02-04,"When Prince Harry compared fighting in Afghanistan to playing a video game , the Taliban were quick to accuse him of mental illness and cowardice , joining a chorus of criticism from all sides .
But in Afghanistan 's highest reaches of government he has found at least one ally .
President Hamid Karzai , usually quick to condemn western mis - steps in his country , told the Guardian that the young royal 's comments may have been a mistake , but he should be let off the hook because of his age . ""
Prince Harry is a young man , we do give exits to young men when they make mistakes , "" said Karzai , who is visiting the UK for a high - level conference , and also expects to meet Prince Charles before flying home .
A long - standing friendship with Charles , whom he described as a "" great representative of Britain "" , may have contributed to Karzai 's uncharacteristic reticence . ""
Prince Charles , the father of Prince Harry , is a very fine gentleman , a man for whom I have tremendous respect , "" Karzai told the Guardian and ITV News in an exclusive interview , when asked whether he thought Harry had spoken unwisely .
But he also drew a telling contrast with Prince Charles 's more peaceful reputation , as he reminisced about years of admiration for his friend 's vocal advocacy of traditional building styles . ""
For years , even when I was a student in Shimla , I used to read about his dislike of modern architecture and the cement buildings and I entirely agreed with him .
Prince Charles is a great representative of Britain and the British ways of life , "" he said .
Karzai is visiting the UK for a trilateral meeting with the British prime minister , David Cameron , and the Pakistani president , Asif Ali Zardari , with the aim of improving fractious relations between the south Asian neighbours and ultimately pave the way for a peace deal with the Taliban .
He arrived shortly after the broadcast of several media interviews Harry gave to mark the end of a 20-week deployment as a co - pilot in an Apache attack helicopter stationed in Camp Bastion , in turbulent southern Helmand province .
Initially , much of the coverage of Harry , which included shots of him ripping out an earpiece as his aircraft was scrambled for an engagement , was greeted largely with admiration .
But the description of his job as a "" joy "" sat uneasily with admissions that he had probably killed Taliban fighters from the helicopter .
"" Take a life to save a life , that 's what we revolve around .
If there 's people trying to do bad stuff to our guys , then we 'll take them out of the game , "" he said .
"" I 'm not here on a free pass …
Our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground and if that means shooting someone who is shooting them , then we will do it . ""
The prince , who was in charge of firing the Apache 's Hellfire air - to - surface missiles , rockets and 30 mm gun , also said his taste for video games helped him in battle .
"" It 's a joy for me because I 'm one of those people who loves playing PlayStation and Xbox , so with my thumbs I like to think I 'm probably quite useful , "" he said .
Pushed again about the remarks , Karzai said most people had made mistakes in their youth and should n't be hounded for that . ""
As I said , he 's a young man , and young men do make mistakes talking , while behaving , all of us have gone through that period , so let 's drop it there . ""
Harry 's enemies on the battlefield , who have also said they are targeting Karzai even as his government tries to reach out to them , were not so reticent , describing the young prince as a coward who ran away from fighting the mujahideen , or "" holy warriors "" , as the militants like to call themselves .
"" I do n't believe that he participated in the fighting , "" said Zabiullah Mujahid , a spokesman for the Taliban .
"" Maybe he has seen the mujahideen in a movie , but that 's it . ""
He accused Harry , who has now completed two tours in one of Afghanistan 's roughest provinces , of staying away from the fight .
"" I think he has a mental problem , that 's why he is saying it is a game , "" he said .
"" These kind of people live like diplomats in Afghanistan , they ca n't risk themselves by standing against the mujahideen . """
2013-02-07,"Living in the shadow of terror and the threat of assassination around the clock , Hamid Karzai could be forgiven for indulging in a bit of relaxing comfort whenever he gets the chance .
But to touch down in London and check into Claridge 's , one of the most luxurious hotels in the world , the day he issued a decree back home to curtail government expenses is , at best , a sign that the Afghan president is prone to a touch of political frailty like the best of his western counterparts .
For this is where he and an entourage of 40 officials stayed on their whistlestop visit to London for talks with the Pakistan president , Asif Ali Zardari , on Monday night .
Rooms at Claridge 's , a byword for refined luxury and a hotel favoured by royalty and celebrity alike , cost anything from £ 300 but the individually crafted suites favoured by hundreds of heads of state over the years cost thousands a night .
The top - of - the - range Brook penthouse , where the truly rich and famous stay , is bigger than a standard Victorian terraced house at just under 185 square metres ( 2,000 sq ft ) . ""
Designed by Veere Grenney , this elegant art deco - style apartment is decorated in gentle lilac with light oak floors "" and "" an idiosyncratic blend of old and new furnishings , "" gushes the hotel 's website .
The nightly tariff , available on request , is a cool £ 6,900 a night .
Impecunious VIPs can opt for the cheaper suites at about £ 1,000 a night .
But even a budget - conscious , non - drinking guest is not going to come off lightly after a stay in Claridge 's .
A non - alcoholic raspberry crush in the Fumoir bar will set the purse back £ 8 , while classic afternoon tea , albeit accompanied by a selection of finger sandwiches and a selection of pastries , costs £ 40 a head .
It is a world away from Arg - e - Shahi Palace , Karzai 's fortress compound in central Kabul where four checkpoints and a battery of army personnel and sniffer dogs protect the president from the constant threat of attack .
One US diplomat described his job as "" the hardest in the world "" .
Four of Afghanistan 's past six presidents have been murdered , three of them in office .
But the irony of a luxury stay in Claridge 's will not be lost on the Afghan electorate .
According to the usually reliable Tolo News , Karzai has ordered government departments to cut back on purchases of deluxe , expensive equipment in favour of domestic products . ""
All ministries and government offices are required to economise on the expenses of stationery , oil materials , repairs and other expenditures , to avoid any unnecessary expense and above - standard per diems for trips out of the country , and to reduce expenses , "" the decree states , reported Tolo News on Monday , just as Karzai was meeting the Prince of Wales , who the president has said "" is a very good friend of Afghanistan "" .
The Afghan embassy was not available for comment .
The use of high - cost items at government departments has been heavily criticised in the past , especially because most of these products are mainly funded with budgets from the international community .
However , it is the first time that the president has so formally addressed it .
So who foots the bill ?
According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) , all heads of state invited on official visits to the UK are treated to stays in first - class hotels such as Claridge 's .
The cost of 10 of Karzai 's entourage was paid for by the British taxpayer , with the remainder on the Afghan tab .
An FCO spokeswoman said : "" Heads of state on guest of government visits are able to stay in a range of hotels of a similar level , including Claridge 's .
Accommodation is determined by a variety of factors , including suitability for a head of state , location and security .
As you would expect , we do not go into detail on accommodation or other arrangements for visiting heads of state .
"" The FCO is said to be proud to have run the trilateral event hosted by the prime minister in Chequers and will have seen the cost of putting up part of Karzai 's entourage as money worth spending – especially if it leads to a deal .
Charming , clever , and fluent in Pashtu , Dari , English and Urdu , he made Esquire magazine 's list of best - dressed men in 2004 , and seems at home anywhere from the remotest corners of Afghanistan to western capitals .
Karzai took power as a temporary leader of his country after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , then won two successive presidential polls , in 2004 and 2009 , and confesses he is looking forward to a rest .
He told the Guardian in an interview on Monday that it is a decade since he took a holiday .
And Karzai is certainly not the first head of state from a country relying on foreign aid to stay at the hotel .
Foreign aid accounts for 40 % of Malawi 's budget yet President Joyce Banda stayed there shortly after she rose from vice - president to the top job last year .
During the Olympics a team of 16 from Malawi stayed for 11 nights , while a team of nine from Gabon had an eight - night stay during the Games .
Karzai 's friendship with Prince Charles , who he describes as a "" very fine gentlemen "" , has also yielded dividends for Afghanistan and the owners of Claridge 's .
The Turquoise Mountain Foundation charity was founded at the request of the prince in 2006 to protect and encourage ancient Afghan craftsmanship in calligraphy , woodwork , jewellery and ceramics .
It was subsequently commissioned by the Maybourne Hotel Group , which owns Claridge 's , to craft The Prince 's Lodge Suite at the Connaught , an exquisite room involving 37 square metres of carved dark walnut for a four - poster bed , alcoves , architraves and cabinets ."
2013-02-13,"A Nato air strike in eastern Afghanistan has killed 10 civilians , five of them children , and wounded five other children , Afghan officials said .
Civilian deaths in air strikes have been one of the most emotive and high - profile issues of the war in Afghanistan , although in recent years UN statistics show that the Taliban have caused the majority of civilian casualties .
If confirmed the latest deaths are likely to spark protests and renew tensions over civilian casualties between the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , and the Nato - led military coalition .
A single home in the remote Sultan valley , in Kunar province , was hit by bombs around 3 am on Wednesday , said Wasifullah Wasifi , spokesman for the provincial governor .
Four Taliban commanders were also killed in the attack , said Farid , chief of staff for the Kunar governor who , like many Afghans , goes by only one name .
"" Four women and five children were killed , and five children wounded .
One man , who was the leader of the family , was also killed , according to reports from the site , "" Farid told the Guardian by phone from Kunar . ""
Four Taliban commanders were also killed in this incident , but it is not clear in what part of the site they were , whether they were inside the house .
We have sent a delegation to the site . ""
The MP for Kunar , Haji Sakhi , said : "" There is no government control in that area , it is all controlled by militants .
Several times we have complained to ministry of defence , ministry of interior and presidential palace about it . ""
Two Pakistani Taliban and three Afghan Taliban were killed .
Among them was a well - known commander from the area , Qari Shah Pur , "" he said , adding that "" seven people were also arrested by Nato , [ and ] those still there say they were innocent "" .
The Nato - led coalition declined to confirm whether there had been an air strike in the area overnight , saying only that it was looking into allegations of civilian casualties .
"" We are looking into allegations of civilian casualties and we are assessing the circumstances , "" said a spokesman in Kabul , Major Gary Allen .
"" I can not even confirm the raid or air strike .
We are trying to assess what exactly did happen . ""
Heavy publicity around air strikes that have killed civilians in Afghanistan have sometimes meant that other types of explosions have been mistaken for such incidents .
The deaths came hours before President Barack Obama announced that he would be withdrawing 34,000 US troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year , and a similar number in 2014 , which he said would bring an end to the US war in Afghanistan .
A small number of US and Nato forces are expected to stay on to help train Afghan soldiers and possibly target groups like al - Qaida in lawless parts of the country , but Obama has said they will not be involved in the domestic fight against Taliban insurgents ."
2013-02-24,"The Afghan government has ordered US special forces to leave one of Afghanistan 's most restive provinces , Maidan Wardak , after receiving reports from local officials claiming that the elite units had been involved in the torture and disappearance of Afghan civilians .
US military officials have rejected the allegations but President Hamid Karzai , who convened a meeting of the Afghan national security council on Sunday , appears to believe the evidence was strong enough to demand US special forces leave Maidan Wardak within two weeks .
Security in the province bordering Kabul has deteriorated over the past year , and it has become a focus of US - led efforts to stop insurgents reaching the capital .
The decision could have implications for relations with Washington and for US plans to maintain a counter - terrorist force in Afghanistan after Nato combat troops leave in 2014 .
The provincial governor and other officials from Maidan Wardak presented evidence against US forces at the national security council meeting .
The presidential palace later issued a statement saying : "" After a thorough discussion , it became clear that armed individuals named as US special forces stationed in Wardak province engage in harassing , annoying , torturing and even murdering innocent people . ""
A recent example in the province is an incident in which nine people were disappeared in an operation by this suspicious force and in a separate incident a student was taken away at night from his home , whose tortured body with throat cut was found two days later under a bridge , "" the statement added . ""
However , Americans reject having conducted any such operation and any involvement of their special force . ""
The Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) in Kabul said it was aware of the order , but declined to provide further information .
It was also unable to confirm the number of US special forces in Maidan Wardak .
"" We take allegations of misconduct seriously and go to great lengths to determine the facts surrounding them , but until we 've had a chance to talk to senior government of Afghanistan officials , we 're not in a position to comment further , "" an Isaf spokesman said .
Aimal Faizi , spokesman for Karzai , said the decision came after of months of reports of abuse .
"" People have been complaining about US special forces units torturing people , killing people in that province , and nine individuals were taken from their homes recently and they have just disappeared and no one knows where they have gone , "" Faizi said .
"" These individuals in the US special forces , who are behind these crimes like murdering and torturing people and harassing people , this is in itself an elemental factor in the deteriorating security situation .
"" Afghanistan 's elite commando forces , including the 1st , 2nd and 6th special operations kandak , also operate in Maidan Wardak , often working alongside US special forces .
Faizi said that this association had also fuelled negative feeling towards the Afghan government in the area , something officials wanted to stem .
Lotfullah Najafizada , the head of current affairs at TOLOnews television channel , said : "" President Karzai apparently believes that the US special forces are more part of the problem than the solution . ""
The banning of US special forces from Maidan Wardak following steadily mounting unease expressed by the Karzai government over Nato operations .
After last week 's National Security Council meeting , an order [ http://president.gov.af/en/news/17522 ] was issued for Afghan forces "" to impede operations "" by parallel militias set up by foreign coalition forces outside the Afghan military chain of command , which have long been a source of irritation to Karzai .
Afghan forces were also banned from calling in Nato airstrikes after nine civilians were killed in a single incident .
The palace announcement served as a reminder that the size and nature of western forces remaining in Afghanistan after 2014 are far from agreed .
Karzai was reportedly irked but reports from a Nato meeting in Brussels on Friday [ http://www.navytimes.com/news/2013/02/ap-german-minister-says-us-to-leave-8k-12k-troops-afghanistan-022213/ ] , at which a follow - out force of 12,000 was discussed .
Leon Panetta , the outgoing US defence secretary was quoted as saying that the mainly American force would be deployed in all areas of the country .
Observers in Kabul suggested that Karzai 's announcement was intended as a message to Washington not to take Afghan acquiescence in US decisions on bases and unilateral counter - terrorist operations for granted .
There have also been tough negotiations between the Washington and Kabul over American demands that serving US soldiers should have immunity under Afghan law . ""
This decision is going to complicate the negotiations over bilateral security agreements with the United States , "" Najafizada said .
The Americans want to be able to carry out unilateral counter - terrorist operations after 2014 which can justify their presence domestically in the US , but now it seems to be the hard piece to negotiate , along with immunity . """
2013-03-10,"Strained US - Afghan ties have suffered a fresh blow after newly appointed US defence secretary Chuck Hagel cancelled plans for his first joint news conference with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , the second reminder of serious tensions in a brief visit to Afghanistan .
US officials cited security concerns , but the decision came just hours after the Afghan leader accused America of colluding with the Taliban to keep foreign troops on Afghan soil .
Afghan officials said the presidential palace , where the men planned to meet the press , was totally safe .
"" It does n't make any sense , "" said one Afghan official , who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorised to discuss the sensitive issue .
"" It was supposed to take place at the palace , we do n't see any security problems there . ""
US officials said the decision was taken because security concerns were raised , and only after consultations with the Afghan government .
But it was the second time in two days that US - Afghan tensions had been made public : on Saturday the planned handover of the final batch of Afghan prisoners held by US forces was also cancelled at the last minute .
Both of the planned displays of public trust and unity were called off in the wake of remarks by Karzai , although US and Afghan officials declined to comment on whether there was any connection with the subsequent halt of the transfer and cancellation of the press conference .
Earlier on Sunday Karzai had said that recent suicide bomb attacks in Kabul and Khost province , in which 17 people died , were a sign of shared Taliban and US efforts to justify a longterm foreign troop presence . ""
The explosions in Kabul and Khost yesterday showed that they [ the Taliban ] are at the service of America , "" Karzai said in a nationally televised speech to mark International Women 's Day .
"" They are trying to frighten us into thinking that if the foreigners are not in Afghanistan , we would be facing these sorts of incidents . ""
The top US and Nato commander in Afghanistan strongly denied any link with insurgents .
"" We have fought too hard over the past 12 years , we have shed too much blood over the last 12 years , to ever think that violence or instability would be to our advantage , "" General Joseph Dunford told journalists travelling with Hagel , the Associated Press reported .
Saturday 's cancellation of the prisoner transfer came after Karzai told the opening of parliament that some of the men held by US forces were innocent and he would free them when they had been handed over .
US officials have said they have detained some prisoners based on classified intelligence they can not share , but do not hold anyone without cause ."
2013-03-11,"The White House rejected as "" categorically false "" a claim by Afghan president Hamid Karzai that the US was effectively colluding with the Taliban in maintaining violence to prolong America 's presence in the country .
Karzai 's outburst on Sunday , while new US defence secretary Chuck Hagel was making his first visit to the country , highlighted tensions between Washington and the Afghan government as Nato forces withdraw from the country and negotiations continue over the number of troops to be left behind after 2014 .
The White House response to Karzai 's latest criticism of the US came as an Afghan dressed in a police uniform opened fire in the disputed Wardak , province killing two US soldiers and at least two Afghans .
One of the Americans killed was a special forces operative from the Green Berets , CNN reported .
Karzai had set Monday as the deadline for the withdrawal of all US special operatives from Wardak province after allegations of abuse , but the US has so far refused .
At the daily White House briefing on Monday , press secretary Jay Carney said : "" Any suggestion that the US is colluding with the Taliban is categorically false .
Secretary Hagel addressed the questions with president Karzai in their meeting .
"" The US has spent enormous blood and treasure for the past 12 years supporting the Afghan people in an effort to ensure stability and security in that country .
The last thing we would do is support any kind of violence , particularly involving innocent civilians .
"" Carney was measured in his response , resisting a call at the press conference to use more strident language .
In the past , the Obama administration responded more vigorously to critical comments by Karzai but concluded this was counter - productive .
Carney suggested the latest comments would not have an impact on the schedule for withdrawal , which he stressed had been put in place with agreement with Nato and other allies .
"" There is no question there have been a number of difficult security incidents , and there have been comments by President Karzai with which we have disagreed .
But our policy has not changed .
We went into Afghanistan because we are attacked from Afghanistan . ""
A decison on the size of the post-2014 US force would be made at a later date by Obama .
, Carney added .
The latest insider attack capped a troubled three - day visit by Hagel .
The faltering start will provide more material for his many critics in Congress who opposed his nomination , particularly after his hesitant appearance at his Senate confirmation hearing .
A press statement from Isaf military headquarters in Afghanistan said the two Americans were killed in an apparent ' green - on - blue ' incident , along with at least two Afghan soldiers .
A further 10 were wounded .
The attacker used a machine - gun mounted on a truck in the village of Jalrez .
Hagel failed to resolve the dispute in Wardak province over withdrawal of special operations forces .
He was also scheduled to hand over control of Parwan prison to Afghan authorities but this was cancelled a day before the ceremony .
It is understood the deal collapsed amid continued disagreement over detention of prisoners without trial , and a US demand that it have power to block the release of inmates it considers particularly dangerous ."
2013-03-24,"Washington has sealed plans for the much - delayed handover of the last Afghan prisoners it holds on Afghan soil , removing a major irritant to ties with Kabul and leaving the UK as the only foreign power still jailing Afghans in their own country .
Britain halted transfers to Afghan jails over torture concerns , and after Monday 's ceremony to give Afghanistan full control of the Bagram prison , could face greater pressure from Afghan president Hamid Karzai over that stance .
The Afghan leader has long been an outspoken opponent of foreign - run jails that he sees as a serious violation of national sovereignty , but until now had focused most of his attention and political firepower on getting US forces to relinquish their huge prison near Kabul .
Dozens of detainees captured by the British military may be his next target .
The men have been in legal limbo in a Helmand prison since the high court blocked a determined attempt by the Ministry of Defence to transfer them to Afghan jails , when evidence was presented that they could face torture there .
The prisoners are not being tried in either the UK or Afghan judicial systems , but British commanders are not willing to release men they consider dangerous militants .
Karzai demanded their transfer after the ruling , but since then the UN and an Afghan government delegation have both found evidence of torture in some Afghan jails .
The Bagram jail , near the airbase of the same name , became notorious among Afghans after US abuse led to the deaths of at least two prisoners .
The US military also ran a secret prison there which Afghans dubbed the "" black jail "" , the International Committee of the Red Cross told to the BBC in 2010 .
After years of demands from Karzai for the transfer of the jail , a deal was reached a year ago to start a slow handover , to be completed in September 2012 .
But the US and Afghanistan clashed repeatedly over the long - term detention of some of the men captured by Nato forces during a decade of fighting .
A new handover date was set for early March , during a visit by US defence secretary Chuck Hagel .
But days before Hagel landed , Karzai told the opening of Afghanistan 's parliament that some of the men held by US forces were innocent and he would free them when they had been handed over .
Shortly afterwards the transfer ceremony was cancelled .
US officials have said they detained some prisoners based on classified intelligence they can not share , but that they do not hold anyone without cause .
The handover of Bagram prison probably means that the Afghan government has agreed to extend the US provision of "" administrative detention "" for cases where classified evidence can not be presented in court or would not result in a conviction .
Afghanistan has not previously used the system , which has been criticised by human rights groups .
The US will probably continue to hold some foreign prisoners captured in Afghanistan , as the focus of Karzai 's objections has been detention of his own citizens , Afghan and Nato sources have said ."
2013-03-31,"British commanders have warned that the war against the Taliban is entering its most critical phase as Afghanistan 's security forces prepare to fight the insurgency on their own for the first time without Nato troops alongside them on the frontline .
President Hamid Karzai is expected to announce that the Afghan army and police will shortly take the lead in combat operations across the whole of Afghanistan , and senior officers interviewed by the Guardian said the next six months – known as the "" fighting season "" – would show if the bold strategy had paid off .
In Helmand , where British forces have been based since 2006 , commanders believe the Afghan National Security Forces ( ANSF ) will be able to cope .
But they also insisted that UK combat troops would remain on standby until the end of 2014 to help "" in extremis "" – and that the ANSF had to try to reduce the number of casualties it has sustained .
Brigadier Bob Bruce , the commander of Task Force Helmand , denied the approach was a gamble , and said it was the right time for UK forces to step back to allow the Afghans to gain confidence before Nato combat troops withdraw next year .
"" This is their problem .
This is their insurgency .
We know for a fact there is no military solution to the insurgency ; there is no way the military is going to win a counter - insurgency [ war ] because it is essentially a political issue .
It is a battle of offers : the offer the government makes to the people and the offer the insurgents make to the people . ""
Bruce admitted the campaign was "" at a very challenging stage "" .
"" It is a period of some uncertainties but we reduce the risk by retaining combat capability right to the end , to the end of 2014 .
We will have the capability to do so , at a reducing scale .
We are here to support them if they really struggle . ""
"" I am not interested in gambles .
People 's lives are at stake .
This is a plan at the end of a long campaign .
It is a plan that has some risk , but that has been carefully mitigated .
I know they are good enough .
They are genuinely very capable now . ""
Bruce said the ANSF was a new and developing force and it needed to be weaned off the support of Nato 's International Security and Assistance Force ( Isaf ) .
In recent weeks , the Afghans had asked for help on low - level operations but the UK had refused .
"" They are finding their feet and they are doing this in contact with a pretty ruthless and determined enemy .
They have had a pretty hard fight , as have we .
Confidence comes when you have overcome a challenge and this summer will be their biggest challenge yet . ""
He added : "" We will not let them fail .
When they really need us , we will intervene . ""
Lieutenant General Nick Carter , the most senior British officer in Afghanistan , and deputy commander of all Nato forces , said people should not be surprised if UK troops were called into action between now and the end of next year , when Nato formally ends 13 years of operations .
"" We want the Afghans to manage this on their own but we do still need to be prepared to support them in the event of this fighting season becoming very intensive .
And that is why it is important that we still have combat power available .
"" People should not be surprised if there is a setback that needs to be dealt with , because Afghanistan is still a very difficult place and there is a good deal more work to be done . ""
Carter admitted the ANSF were taking too many casualties – 1,100 deaths in six months last year , a rate he described as "" unsustainable "" .
He said the high numbers were "" indicative of the challenges "" still facing the Afghans , and warned it would damage confidence unless it could be brought down . ""
Most of their casualties are caused by IEDs [ improvised explosive devices ] .
Their counter - IED capability is developing and they find more IEDs than we do , but they need greater capacity . ""
The top of the Afghan army and Afghan MoD [ defence ministry ] need to recognise they have to drive a culture down through the army , to get leaders to acknowledge that the casualty rates are unsustainable
And they have to do something about it , "" he said .
Carter also took issue with those who used a phrase coined by the Americans , "" Afghan good enough "" , as the benchmark for success .
It was first coined by the Americans and has been adopted by politicians and thinkers on both sides of the Atlantic .
"" I have never liked that phrase because it is patronising , "" he said .
"" My sense is that Afghanistan has reached a point of progression .
Progress now needs to be maintained over the next 10–20 years and we need to help stimulate this mood and this momentum . ""
As you travel in that direction you will obviously have speed bumps , and we are not going to solve many of the problems overnight but provided you get some development in civil society terms that becomes irreversible , and I think we are not far away from that point .
You can park thoughts like being ' good enough ' , and you can see Afghanistan being pointed in a direction that is progressive and meets people 's expectations . ""
Nic Hailey , acting UK ambassador in Kabul , said it was "" inevitable "" that parts of Afghanistan would not be under ANSF control by the end of 2014 .
He warned that the Taliban were divided internally about whether to enter the political process before next year 's presidential elections ."
2013-04-19,"President Hamid Karzai is determined to curb CIA operations in Afghanistan after the death of a US agent and 10 Afghan children in a battle he believes was fought by an illegal militia working for the US spy agency .
The campaign sets the Afghan leader up for another heated showdown with the US government , and will reignite questions about the CIA 's extensive but highly secretive operations in the country .
Karzai 's spokesman Aimal Faizi said the CIA controlled large commando - like units , some of whom operated under the nominal stamp of the Afghan government 's intelligence agency , the National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) , but were not actually under its control .
"" Some of them are said to be working with the NDS , but they are not armed by the NDS , not paid by the NDS , and not sent to operations by the NDS .
Sometimes they only inform the NDS minutes before the operation , "" Faizi said .
"" They are conducting operations without informing local authorities and when something goes wrong it is called a joint operation .
"" One of these groups was involved in a battle with insurgents in a remote corner of eastern Kunar province in early April that left several Afghan children dead , Faizi said .
Karzai has fired the provincial head of intelligence in connection with the incident .
The US citizen who died during the battle was advising the Afghan intelligence service , and the airstrike that killed the children is believed to have been called in after he was fatally injured .
The US embassy declined to comment on CIA issues , but sources with knowledge of the battle said he was an agent , and his name has not been released , usually an indication of intelligence work .
Bob Woodward in his 2010 book Obama 's Wars described a 3,000-strong Afghan militia working for the CIA , and Faizi said the Afghan government had little information about the teams .
"" There is a lack of clarity about their numbers and movement , "" he said when asked how many men the CIA had on their payroll , or where these large teams might be based .
Woodward said the unofficial commando units were known as counter - terrorism pursuit teams , and described them as "" a paid , trained and functioning tool of the CIA "" , authorised by President George W Bush .
They were sent on operations to kill or capture insurgent leaders , but also went into lawless areas to try to pacify them and win support for the Afghan government and its foreign backers .
Woodward said the units even conducted cross - border raids into Pakistan .
In the wake of the Kunar battle , Karzai has also ordered his security officials to step up implementation of a presidential decree issued in late February abolishing "" parallel structures "" .
Faizi said this order was aimed primarily at dismantling CIA - controlled teams .
"" The use of these parallel structures run by the CIA and US special forces is an issue of concern for the Afghan people and the Afghan government , "" he said .
For Karzai the move is another step towards reasserting Afghan sovereignty , part of a long campaign waged against US forces and their allies .
He has already won control of the main US - run prison in the country , and ended unilateral night raids on insurgent hideouts that coalition commanders once described as critical to the war .
But Karzai 's move comes at a critical time for an already volatile relationship , when Washington and Kabul are trying to negotiate what , if any , military presence the US will have in Afghanistan beyond 2014 , and curbing the CIA 's reach could strike at the heart of US strategic interests there .
Barack Obama has been clear that the US does not plan to fight the Taliban after next year .
Instead some foreign troops will train Afghan soldiers to fight the insurgency while US special forces pursue groups such as al - Qaida hiding along the lawless border with Pakistan .
While the US is expected to keep a few thousand soldiers in Afghanistan , bolstered by troops from Nato allies , Obama has also made clear there is "" zero option "" of a complete US withdrawal , as happened in Iraq ."
2013-04-25,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has heeded a call from a conservative clerical group to halt the broadcast of "" un - Islamic "" films and serials , issuing a vague decree that some see as a move to stifle debate before presidential elections next year or even to placate the Taliban .
The Ulema Council complained to Karzai that there were "" many TV stations that turn to vulgarisms and broadcast immoral programmes , which are counter to national interests and Islamic values "" .
Karzai said in a statement : "" The ministry of information and culture must prevent [ television channels ] from broadcasting programmes which are vulgar , obscene and un - Islamic and are counter to social morality . ""
Over the past decade Afghanistan has experienced a boom in communications , after television was banned during the Taliban 's five years of rule .
Encouraged and sometimes funded by western governments , there are now dozens of television channels operating in the country , with around 36 in Kabul alone .
Rafi Ferdous , a government spokesman , said the ministry would halt the broadcast of television shows and films that were "" against our society 's norms , values and Islamic fundamentals "" .
But besides mentioning Bollywood films – known for their hip - shaking musical numbers – he was not specific about what exactly would be banned .
Anticipating anger from viewers and rights monitors , Ferdous emphasised that the government respected "" the freedom of media and speech according to the instructions of the Afghan constitution in which social norms , values and religious fundamentals are the basic reasons to be respected by everyone "" .
But Abdul Mujeeb Khalvatgar , the head of Nai , an independent media watchdog and training centre , said : "" I have seen the decree .
It is vague and against the constitution and the law on the media .
According to the suggestions of the Ulema Council , television should be careful about airing or broadcasting films or serials that are against – and this is the vague part – against the public ethics of Afghanistan and the sub - rules of Islam .
But those sub - rules are different from one person to the next , from one sect to the next .
"" It is my professional and personal opinion that they are trying to limit the free access of information before the presidential election , "" he said .
It could also be an attempt to "" make the Taliban happy , to pull them in for reconciliation "" , Khalvatgar added ."
2013-04-30,"The CIA and MI6 have regularly given large cash payments to Hamid Karzai 's office with the aim of maintaining access to the Afghan leader and his top allies and officials , but the attempt to buy influence has largely failed and may have backfired , former diplomats and policy analysts say .
The Guardian understands that the payments by British intelligence were on a smaller scale than the CIA 's handouts , reported in the New York Times to have been in the tens of millions , and much of the British money has gone towards attempts to finance peace initiatives , which have so far proved abortive .
That failure has raised questions among some British officials over whether eagerness to promote a political settlement may have been exploited by Afghan officials and self - styled intermediaries for the Taliban .
Responding to the allegations while on a visit to Helsinki on Monday , Karzai said his national security council ( NSC ) had received support from the US government for the past 10 years , and the amounts involved were "" not big "" and were used for a variety of purposes including helping those wounded in the conflict .
"" It 's multi - purpose assistance , "" he said , without commenting on the allegations that the money was fuelling corruption .
Yama Torabi , the director of Integrity Watch Afghanistan said that the presidency 's low - key response to the reports had "" outraged people "" . ""
As a result , we do n't know what was the amount of money that was given , what it was used for and if there was any corruption involved .
Money when it is unchecked can be abused and this looks like one .
In addition , it can be potentially used to corrupt politicians and political circles , but there is no way to know this unless there is a serious investigation into it , "" Torabi told The Guardian .
Kabul sources told the Guardian that the key official involved in distributing the payments within the NSC was Ibrahim Spinzada , a close confidant of the president known as Engineer Ibrahim .
There is , however , no evidence that Spinzada personally gained from the cash payments or that in distributing them among the president 's allies and sometimes his foes he was breaking Afghan law .
Officials say the payments , referred to in a New York Times report as "" ghost money "" , helped prop up warlords and corrupt officials , deepening Afghan popular mistrust of the Kabul government and its foreign backers , and thereby helped drive the insurgency .
The CIA money has sometimes caused divisions between the various branches of US government represented in Kabul , according to diplomats stationed in Kabul , particularly when it helped give the CIA chief of station in Kabul direct access to Karzai without the US ambassador 's knowledge or approval .
One former Afghan budgetary official told the Guardian : "" On paper there was very little money that went to the National Directorate of Security [ NDS , the Afghan intelligence service ] , but we knew they were taken care of separately by the CIA . ""
The thing about US money is a lot of it goes outside the budget , directly through individuals and companies , and that opens the way for corruption . ""
Khalil Roman , who served as Karzai 's deputy chief of staff from 2002 until 2005 , told the New York Times : "" We called it ' ghost money ' .
It came in secret , and it left in secret . ""
One American official told the newspaper : "" The biggest source of corruption in Afghanistan was the United States . ""
Sources said the MI6 aid was on a smaller scale , and much of it was focused on trying to promote meetings between Karzai 's government and Taliban intermediaries , as was embarrassingly the case in 2010 when MI6 discovered a would - be Taliban leader in talks with Karzai was an impostor from the Pakistani city of Quetta .
The British payments have also been designed to bolster UK influence in Kabul , in what a source described as "" an auction with each country trying to outbid the other "" in the course of an often fraught relationship with the Karzai government .
Vali Nasr , a former US government adviser on Afghanistan , said : "" Karzai has been lashing out against American officials and generals , so if indeed there has been funding by the CIA , you have to ask to what effect has that money been paid .
It has n't clearly brought the sort of influence it was meant to . ""
Nasr , now dean of the Johns Hopkins school of advanced international studies and author of a new book criticising US policy in Afghanistan , The Dispensable Nation , said : "" If the terms of such payments are not clear , the question is how well do they tag with US policy …
The CIA has a narrow , counter - terrorism purview that involved working with warlords , but that is quite a different agenda , on how we conduct the war or how we build a government . ""
The CIA has also been heavily criticised for conducting drone attacks against suspected militants over the border in Pakistan and for calling in air strikes inside Afghanistan while on joint operations with NDS units , leading to civilian casualties .
A report on Monday by the Afghanistan Analysts Network , a thinktank in Kabul , said the latest such NDS - CIA operation , in Kunar province on 13 April , killed 17 civilians .
Kate Clark , one of the network 's analysts , said : "" It is one thing to conduct covert operations in a hostile country .
I 'm flabbergasted that the CIA is running these kind of covert operations in a friendly country .
It runs counter to accountability , democracy and the rule of law , and is damaging what the US is trying to do . ""
The CIA puts certain things as a priority – whether someone is against al - Qaida , for example – and damn the rest . """
2013-05-09,"The United States wants to keep troops at nine bases across Afghanistan , the country 's president , Hamid Karzai , said on Thursday – a larger number than expected given Washington 's scaled - back ambitions for shaping the country 's future .
Karzai , who has often been a fierce critic of the foreign forces that have dominated his country for years , was surprisingly conciliatory about the prospect of a long - term US presence .
Keeping American soldiers on the ground was in Afghan interests , he said , as long as the soldiers came with support for the Afghan government and economy .
"" We can agree to give them the bases – them staying on after 2014 is for the good of Afghanistan , "" Karzai said in a speech at Kabul University . ""
The condition is that they bring peace and security and take action quickly … on the basic strengthening of Afghanistan , helping the economy of Afghanistan . ""
The uneasy allies are currently thrashing out a bilateral security agreement ( BSA ) to define the terms for their future co - operation , and Karzai 's comments were the first real insight into the slow and difficult negotiations .
"" We are trying to ensure the interests of both countries are satisfied in this agreement , "" Karzai told students and dignitaries gathered to celebrate the university 's 80th anniversary . ""
We want roads , electricity , hydropower dams , and strengthening of the Afghan government . ""
He may nonetheless have annoyed American officials by revealing details about strategic planning on future commitments to Afghanistan that had been kept under tight wraps .
President Barack Obama has made clear that the US will not fight the Taliban after the Nato - led mission to Afghanistan ends next year ; any troops that stay on will concentrate instead on training Afghan soldiers and tackling al - Qaida and similar groups in the lawless border areas near Pakistan .
Facing budget pressures at home , and a declining appetite for risking lives and US money in Afghanistan , Obama has explored a range of possibilities for supporting Afghanistan in future – including a "" zero option "" that would see the US foot the bill for much of the Afghan military but without any presence on the ground at all .
But the relative weakness of the Afghan army – which is struggling to master key capabilities from bomb detection and heavy weaponry to air power and medical evacuation – means that there is an expectation of some kind of long - term presence to help government forces hold off the battle - hardened Taliban .
The US embassy declined to confirm that Karzai had described its intention to remain in nine bases accurately , but said that it was not trying to secure title to land , or unlimited rights to keep forces on Afghan soil . ""
President Obama has made it clear that we do n't seek permanent military bases in Afghanistan , "" said US embassy spokesman David Snepp .
"" We anticipate that the BSA will address access to and use of Afghan facilities by US forces in the future . ""
The places in which the US wants to keep troops include the capital , Kabul , the sprawling Bagram airbase , which has been the heart of operations in the east , the restive southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand , and Shindand in the west , where Nato is training the Afghan airforce , Karzai said .
The other bases are in the northern hub of Mazar - i - Sharif , the western city of Herat , near the Iranian border , and eastern Gardez and Jalalabad , which is a key gateway to Pakistan and a base for drones .
Karzai 's speech also included an attack on Pakistan after days of skirmishes between Afghan and Pakistani forces along their contested border , so the public embrace of a long - term US military presence may have been intended as a reminder to Islamabad that his country has a powerful ally with a stake in keeping the government in Kabul afloat .
Afghanistan has long accused its neighbour of covert support for insurgent groups that have found safe havens in its lawless mountain regions .

2013-05-20,"Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , has arrived in Delhi on a three - day visit during which he is expected to ask India to boost its assistance to Afghan armed forces .
The request would heighten tensions in the region , and raise concerns among western observers of a fierce battle for influence in Afghanistan after the bulk of US forces are withdrawn next year .
Key Karzai aides said last weekend the Afghan leader would be asking India to help "" with military needs and shortages "" .
India and Afghanistan signed a strategic agreement two years ago and a number of Afghan army officers are being trained at Indian institutions .
Officials in Kabul have repeatedly stressed that they are short of planes , heavy weapons , armoured vehicles and a range of other military supplies .
However , any transfers of Indian arms to Kabul would be seen as deeply provocative by neighbouring Pakistan , where senior military decision - makers have long been concerned about Indian influence in Afghanistan .
Indian officials told the Guardian they saw the statements from Kabul as "" messaging "" , rather than a serious proposal .
"" There are mechanisms to discuss those kind of issues .
We are already providing equipment and assistance within our modest capabilities , "" one senior official said .
He also stressed that Delhi was also aware of "" regional sensitivities "" .
Over the coming months , Indian policymakers will have to balance a desire to bolster influence in Kabul with hopes to improve relations with Islamabad .
The election of Nawaz Sharif for a third time as Pakistan 's prime minister 10 days ago has been broadly welcomed in Delhi .
Sharif , a rightwing businessman , has said he wants to see better ties with his country 's giant eastern neighbour .
Afghan officials have explicitly linked the appeal for military assistance to a series of recent clashes between Pakistani and Afghan border guards and even suggested that they might ask India for artillery .
Both Kabul and Islamabad accuse each other of harbouring militants who launch cross - border raids .
The Afghan ambassador in Delhi last week said that Karzai would seek further co - operation to tackle "" terrorist groups "" .
"" The Afghans are sending a very clear signal to India saying they are looking for more commitment .
They are looking at the situation post-2014 and telling the Indians : show us that you are serious , "" said Raja C Mohan , a respected Delhi - based analyst .
Karzai 's visit to Delhi , ostensibly to collect an honorary degree , follows that of Li Keqiang , the Chinese prime minister , in a hectic few days for diplomacy in the Indian capital .
Though Li made India the first destination of his maiden overseas trip , talks with Indian officials were overshadowed by a recent standoff between Indian and Chinese troops at a remote disputed point on their long and often ill - defined border .
The confrontation in Ladakh , in the western Himalayas , was resolved only two weeks ago .
Though both Li and his Indian counterpart , Manmohan Singh , emphasised their desire to focus on trade between the two emerging economic powers , tensions were evident .
Indian officials told the Guardian that the border dispute had prompted a review of the relationship with Beijing . ""
It was best to indicate that upfront as an area of concern , "" one said .
Li will travel on Tuesday to Islamabad , underlining another dynamic in the region with the potential to cause instability .
Though the depth of the relationship is sometimes exaggerated , Pakistan and China have built closer links in recent years .
India is also concerned about Beijing 's relationship with Sri Lanka and its presence in Bangladesh ."
2013-06-09,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has demanded the return of Afghans held prisoner by the UK military in Helmand , giving London a two - week deadline that is legally impossible for the government to meet .
Last year UK courts banned the government from transferring the prisoners to their own justice system because of widespread torture in Afghan prisons .
This month the defence secretary , Philip Hammond , announced that Kabul and London had agreed safeguards to protect prisoners from torture , and handovers would start after three weeks .
The delay is a requirement to allow for any legal challenges to the decision , and is almost certain to stretch far longer , as lawyers acting for the prisoners have said they will challenge the decision in court .
But Karzai has demanded custody of the prisoners by 22 June .
His spokesman said the British legal system should not be used as an excuse to delay the handover .
"" We are living in Afghanistan and we are talking about Afghans detained on Afghan soil and held in Afghanistan .
According to our laws this is a breach of sovereignty , "" Aimal Faizi told the Guardian . ""
The UK … is another country with its own laws and sovereignty , [ which ] do n't mean anything here in Afghanistan . ""
His tough stance sets the stage for weeks or even months of confrontation , even though the UK insists it is as keen to transfer the prisoners as Karzai is to take custody of them .
"" It is UK government policy to transfer UK - captured detainees into Afghan custody at the earliest opportunity .
It has been the threat of UK court action that has prevented us from transferring detainees to the Afghan authorities since last November , "" the British Embassy said .
"" We must be satisfied that they do not face a real risk of serious mistreatment or torture .
As a matter of priority the UK has been working with the Afghan government to identify a safe transfer route . ""
Nato has periodically halted , then resumed , transfers of prisoners to Afghan authorities over torture concerns documented in detail by the UN .
The Afghan government has also conceded there was torture in some jails , but has been persistent in calling for control of all Afghan prisoners detained domestically .
Karzai had previously focused his ire on the US forces , who held a far larger number of people in a more notorious prison attached to the Bagram airbase .
This year the US handed over the vast detention complex it had built and originally run .
The UK says the men held in Helmand will be sent to this jail , which is large enough to manage all stages of detention , and open to UK monitoring to ensure there are no abuses . ""
The facility at Parwan also includes a justice centre and is a properly resourced national facility at which both investigations and prosecutions can take place .
There is no need , therefore , to transfer detainees to other facilities . ""
But lawyers say previous agreements to keep prisoners in jails where the UK could monitor them for signs of torture were flouted by the Afghan government and there was nothing to suggest the latest deal had any better safeguards .
"" Our client Serdar Mohammed , who brought the case which provoked the moratorium on transfers [ to Afghan authorities ] last November , was transferred [ between Afghan jails ] and then tortured in exactly the way the MoD said would be impossible in an earlier case in 2010 , "" said Richard Stein from the Leigh Day law firm .
"" It is particularly concerning that the current proposals for transfer do not contain an express assurance from the Afghan authorities that there will be no onward transfers , even though the MoD accepts that NDS [ National Directorate of Security , the Afghan intelligence service ] facilities are not safe . ""
The drawdown of foreign forces means the fate of their prisoners is mostly a legacy issue .
Almost all military operations are now joint with Afghan troops , who officially capture and process anyone detained during night raids or elsewhere ."
2013-06-19,"The US was scrambling to salvage a plan to open peace talks with the Taliban on Wednesday amid a diplomatic row between Washington and the Afghan president Hamid Karzai over how the process was announced .
Repeated phone calls by John Kerry , the US secretary of state , appeared not to have mollified Karzai , who accused the Obama administration of duplicity .
Irritated by a press conference in Qatar at which the Taliban effectively portrayed itself as a government in exile , Karzai suspended talks on a long - term security deal to keep US troops in Afghanistan after Nato leaves in 2014 .
News on Tuesday that American diplomats would sit down with Taliban leaders – the first direct talks since the US helped oust the group from power in 2001 – prompted speculation that real progress towards a negotiated end to the war in Afghanistan might be in sight .
But while the Taliban hinted at meeting US demands of a break with al - Qaida – saying Afghan soil should not be used to harm other countries – there was only the barest of nods to the Afghan government 's request that they talk to the current administration and respect the constitution .
They infuriated Karzai by displaying a white Taliban flag and repeatedly referring to the "" Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan "" , the name the group used when they ruled from Kabul .
The Taliban also claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on the Bagram air base that killed four Americans on the same day that the tentative deal about talks was announced .
On Wednesday the US suspended plans to attend the talks , which were due to begin in Doha , the capital of Qatar , this week .
Ambassador James Dobbins , its special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , will now remaining in Washington until further notice .
A state department spokeswoman said the US had also asked the Qatari government to remove a sign from outside a new Taliban office in Doha that proclaimed it as representing the "" Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan "" .
However , wider tensions remain , particularly over the US role in the newly announced peace talks .
"" We are still in discussion with the Afghan government about the appropriate next steps , "" said state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki , who confirmed Dobbins would remain in the US for now .
"" I do n't have any updates on if and when he will travel . ""
Earlier on Wednesday , the Associated Press reported president Karzai would not now continue peace talks with the Taliban unless the US stepped out of the negotiations .
He also suspended talks with the US about handing over security to Afghan forces , citing the Taliban naming of its office as one of Kabul 's concerns .
In a statement Karzai said the office was "" totally contradictory to the guarantees that were made by the USA to Afghanistan "" .
The US says all four parties , including Qatar , had agreed that the Taliban would describe their office in Doha as "" the political office of the Afghan Taliban "" rather than anything that would hint at diplomatic recognition of Taliban sovereignty claims over Afghanistan .
The BBC reported later that the subsequent removal of the sign in Doha might have placated Karzai somewhat and that he may be willing to continue with security handover talks at least .
Nevertheless , the affair has cast a shadow over what Washington had hoped would prove to be breakthrough peace negotiations with the Taliban after 12 years of fighting in the country .
The State Department said the US remained committed to making the talks happen , but acknowledged it had been a shaky start .
"" We always knew there would be bumps in the road , "" said spokeswoman Psaki .
"" Clearly this has been challenging . ""
She denied that Washington had been partly to blame for the breakdown in relations after conflicting messages about the US role appeared to be relayed to Kabul on Tuesday .
"" I am not going to place fault , "" said Psaki .
"" The conditions were agreed by all four parties . ""
The US had pledged the Taliban would only be able to use the Doha as base for talks , not as a political platform , and Karzai felt the Tuesday press conference was a clear violation of that promise , an official Afghan source told the Guardian .
More significant than the name of the Taliban office is the insistence of the US in taking part in broad negotiations at all .
The Afghan government would prefer the US to restrict its role to fringe issues such as the fate of prisoners held by the Taliban .
Washington concedes that the process has to be "" Afghan - led "" to be successful , but the state department repeated claims made by unnamed administration officials on Tuesday that the US wishes to discuss broader issues with the Taliban such as renouncing violence , links with al - Qaida and women 's rights in the country .
Psaki also rejected criticism that the US had caved in by agreeing to meet with the Taliban before it severed links with al - Qaida .
In 2011 , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton had described the issue as an "" unambiguous red line for reconciliation with the insurgents "" , without which the Taliban would not be allowed to be part of a political peace process .
This apparent precondition is now a US negotiating aim instead .
"" We do n't expect that they would decry Al - Qaeda and denounce terrorism immediately off the top – this is the end goal , "" said Psaki on Wednesday .
Kerry rang Karzai on Tuesday night after the initial announcement of talks began to rattle the Kabul government and again on Wednesday following the angry Afghan statement in response .
"" I do n't think there was any confusion but this is a fluid process and it is not unusual for them to be speaking regularly , "" said Psaki .

2013-06-25,"Taliban gunmen launched a suicide attack near the presidential palace and CIA offices in Kabul after using fake security passes to get into the fortified diplomatic zone and killing three checkpoint guards .
Attackers jumped out of a vehicle at a roundabout near the Salam Khana (
Welcome Home ) gate of the presidential palace and opened fire on guards and the former Ariana hotel nearby , which has been used as a CIA base for more than a decade .
A spokesman for the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , said the fighting never approached the palace 's inner area of homes and offices , which lies behind walls that are dozens of metres thick in places .
Journalists who had gathered for early security checks before a presidential press event witnessed the attackers pile out of a minivan .
They fled behind a shrine for shelter , scooping up a young student who had been heading for classes at a nearby school , and took cover as fighting raged for about 90 minutes .
All escaped unhurt .
The Taliban claimed responsibility .
It was the first complex attack since the group said last week that they were open to peace talks . ""
This is very much a message that ' we can still do war as well as peace ' , "" said Kate Clark , of the Afghanistan Analysts Network .
Ariana Square , the scene of the attack , is notorious in Afghanistan as the place where the Taliban hung the body of the former president Najibullah from a lamppost when they took control of the city in 1996 .
Nowadays it is so heavily secured that it is virtually empty of traffic and pedestrians .
The attackers arrived along a road leading up from the river with just one relatively lax checkpoint before the outer palace gate .
The other access roads are more heavily guarded with outer checkpoints and then high security posts , where most vehicles and passengers need prior authorisation to continue .
Kabul 's police chief , Ayoub Salangi , said the attackers had fake identification from a compound inside the unofficial green zone , which is dotted with embassies , military bases and ministries .
"" It was clever of the guards at the gate to recognise the fake identification card and when they understood that , they stopped them and two or three attackers jumped out from the vehicle and fighting started , "" Salangi said .
If the negotiations go ahead they will be the first in the 12-year - long war .
Karzai withdrew his government from negotiation plans after the Taliban presented their Doha villa as a quasi - embassy for a government - in - exile with their white flag flying and a name plaque boasting that it housed representatives from the "" Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan "" .
The flag and plaque have gone , and the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan is in Kabul to try to convince the president to rejoin talks on peace and a long - term US military presence in the country .
Karzai withdrew from the security negotiations in anger at what he said was US duplicity over the peace talks .
Also on Tuesday morning a roadside bomb killed 10 women and children and an elderly man who were travelling in a minibus in southern Kandahar province , the local government said .

2013-06-29,"Military commanders are pressing for international forces to be allowed to provide extensive logistical advice to Afghanistan until 2020 , after concluding that local security forces will be unprepared for full operations when the Nato mission ends next year .
In a sign of tensions between Downing Street and the military , the prime minister used a visit to Afghanistan to rule out any British involvement in such a role after Nato concludes its combat operations at the end of 2014 .
Speaking at a press conference in Kabul with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , David Cameron hailed the work of Afghan security forces , though he left open the possibility that other Nato countries could provide logistical support after 2014 .
He said : "" There will be no British combat troops after the end of 2014 .
British troops are coming home .
That is happening right now . ""
After 2015 , we have said that our contribution will be an officer - training academy , which President Karzai asked us to establish .
We have not made any other commitments , and nor have we been asked to .
Of course , other Nato countries may choose to do more and assist the Afghan forces – not in a combat role .
But from everything I have heard , the Afghan forces are doing a good job ; they are highly capable , motivated and they are capable of delivering security . ""
The prime minister spoke out after military sources raised the alarm about security in Afghanistan after 2014 .
Sources said they have concluded that Afghan forces will need highly technical military advice on providing close air support , the distribution of food and fuel , and on medevac facilities .
There were concerns recently in Sangin when an Afghan brigade had to call off a mission after running out of fuel .
British military commanders have been able to make their assessments after Nato handed control of security for the whole of the country to Afghan forces this month .
The commanders have concluded that a great deal has been achieved , but that Afghan forces will not have built their capacity to full operational levels by the time Nato combat troops leave at the end of 2014 .
The signs of disagreement between No 10 and the military emerged as the prime minister visited Afghanistan amid heavy security after the recent Taliban attack on the green zone in Kabul .
An unusually strong blackout was imposed on the visit after the Taliban intercepted communications on the prime minister 's travel plans to the country in 2010 .
Cameron arrived after Lieutenant - General Nick Carter , the deputy commander of Nato operations in Afghanistan , told the Observer that opportunities to build a dialogue with the Taliban were missed in the past decade .
The US recently announced that it would hold talks with the Taliban , who have been allowed to open a political office in the Qatari capital , Doha .
Cameron indicated that he had some sympathy for Carter 's view .
But he made a point of acknowledging the unease of the families of fallen soldiers about the government 's decision to endorse talks with the Taliban . ""
What I would say to everybody ... is that we should be very proud of the work that British armed service personnel have done here in Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" We came here in 2001 with a very clear purpose – that was to stop this country being used as a base for terrorist attacks against Britain .
We have been successful in that task .
"" The prime minister came close to endorsing Carter 's criticisms of the failure in the past to reach out to the Taliban .
He told Sky News in Lashkar Gah : "" I think you can argue about whether the settlement we put in place after 2001 could have been better arranged .
Since I became prime minister in 2010 , I have been pushing for a political process and that process is now under way . ""
The US agreed to talk to the Taliban after dropping a series of pre - conditions which had included an unequivocal renunciation of al - Qaida and an agreement to abide by the Afghan constitution .
The Taliban simply said it agrees that Afghanistan should not be used as a base to attack other countries .
British diplomatic sources voiced strong support for the change of tack by the US .
They even suggested that the Afghan constitution could be amended to take account of some of the Taliban 's concerns .
One source said the constitution follows a winner - takes - all approach which concentrates strong powers in the hands of the president .
This is not seen to be compatible with a process of reconciliation .
But the other key Taliban demand – to give the constitution a more Islamic flavour – is regarded as unacceptable because diplomatic sources believe the constitution is sufficiently Islamic .
Any changes to the constitution would take place after the presidential election in April 2014 .
Karzai has to stand down as president after serving two terms .
The sources said that Taliban prisoners would have to be released as part of negotiations .
They would be free to play a role in the Afghan armed forces .
The prime minister announced during his visit that a wall at the main British army base at Camp Bastion , which commemorates soldiers who lost their lives in the conflict , is to be dismantled and rebuilt in Britain with funds from the Libor bank fines .

2013-07-09,"The Obama administration may close down the US military presence in Afghanistan more abruptly than previously planned with a "" zero option "" being weighed for the country after 2014 , the Pentagon said on Tuesday .
President Barack Obama is considering removing all troops by the time that a previously stated deadline to recall combat personnel lapses at the end of next year , defense spokesman George Little confirmed in a news briefing .
The administration had been in talks with Afghan president Hamid Karzai to leave a "" residual force "" in the country beyond the 2014 pullout , mainly to assist in training and security matters .
White House spokesman Jay Carney later confirmed that the so - called "" zero option "" is under consideration .
The possibility of an accelerated drawdown process was first reported in the New York Times .
Responding to questions over the possibility of no troops being left , Carney said : "" It 's of course an option . ""
"" Because the issue here is not the number of troops for their own sake .
The issue is how do we best … implement our policy objectives ? ""
The Pentagon declined to comment on defense secretary Chuck Hagel 's personal views over the so - called "" zero option "" .
Meanwhile , Carney dismissed the notion that it was growing too late in the day to make major new adjustments to the Afghanistan endgame .
"" There 's no decision that 's imminent , "" Carney said .
"" We 're 18 months from the end of 2014 , and we are in the process of drawing down our forces already , and that process will continue …
I think there 's ample time . ""
The White House said a residual force staying in Afghanistan into 2015 is also still an option .
The pace of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan is the subject of faltering negotiations between Washington and the Karzai government .
The relationship between Washington and Kabul has been hit by issues including civilian casualties and the use of drones by the US military .
Karzai has also reacted angrily to US plans to meet with the Taliban for peace talks in June , accusing the US of duplicity .
Obama , meanwhile , has repeatedly pushed to accelerate the pullout from Afghanistan .
In his state of the union address in February , the president announced that he would draw down the US presence from the current force of 63,000 troops to about 34,000 within one year ."
2013-08-08,"A bomb hidden in a cemetery killed seven Afghan women and seven children who had gathered to mark the festival of Eid al - Fitr at the grave of a relative , as President Hamid Karzai called for the Taliban to lay down their arms and join peace talks .
The bloody start to a festival that is supposed to be a time of joy and family reunions underlined the intensity of Afghanistan 's conflict this summer .
In a separate incident on the eve of the festival , gunmen shot dead a female senator 's eight - year - old daughter and her driver .
The senator , Rouh Gul Khairzad , and other relatives were injured but survived the ambush in Ghazni , an increasingly violent province south of Kabul .
In Helmand on the same day , a suicide bomber targeted the car of the provincial police chief , killing three of his bodyguards , though the commander escaped unharmed .
Nato troops are in the middle of a drawdown that will end next year , and insurgents are testing the skills and resolve of the Afghan police and army taking over from them .
The graveyard bombing happened in a rural area of eastern Nangahar province .
The district chief , Mashoq Malam , told the Associated Press : "" These are cruel people who do n't respect God or Islam and planted a mine on a grave .
As soon as the poor women and children gathered by the grave , it exploded .
"" The bomb was hidden on the grave of a tribal elder who had been killed about eight months ago by the Taliban .
The dead elder 's brother told the Associated Press that he had lost at least one child in the attack and the family was devastated .
"" My family is finished .
These people are inhuman , "" said Haji Ghalib , a former anti - Soviet fighter who said he had spent time in Guantánamo Bay prison as a suspected Taliban sympathiser but was now on a government commission to try to broker peace talks .
The rural deaths came days after the provincial capital , Jalalabad , which lies near the border with Pakistan , was shaken by three consecutive days of attacks .
In the first , an assault by gunmen on the Indian consulate in the city , several children studying in a nearby mosque were among nine civilians killed .
Two other attacks including a magnetic bomb attached to a police car claimed several lives .
Karzai , who is due to step down next April , condemned the "" cowardly "" attack on civilians on a day that should be filled with joy .
"" They even attack in a Muslim cemetery on the start of Eid , they kill our innocent countrymen , "" he said .
Earlier in an Eid speech after prayers in the capital , Kabul , he called on the insurgents to lay down their weapons and stop killing innocent civilians , highlighting the high toll from roadside bombs during the holy month of Ramadan ."
2013-10-08,"Hamid Karzai has ruled out signing a security deal with the United States until disagreements over sovereignty are resolved .
In angry remarks , the Afghan president condemned the Nato alliance for a military occupation that had caused "" a lot of suffering , a lot of loss of life and no gains because the country is not secure "" .
At a press conference where he discussed the Bilateral Security Agreement ( BSA ) that keeps foreign troops in Afghanistan , Karzai was questioned about a Nato airstrike on 5 October in Nangarhar province that the Afghan government claimed killed five civilians .
He cast doubt over whether the agreement would be renewed .
Karzai said : "" The United States and Nato have not respected our sovereignty .
Whenever they find it suitable to them , they have acted against it .
This has been a serious point of contention between us and that is why we are taking issue of the BSA strenuously in the negotiations right now , "" Karzai said .
"" They commit their violations against our sovereignty and conduct raids against our people , air raids and other attacks in the name of the fight on terrorism and in the name of the resolutions of the United Nations .
This is against our wishes and repeatedly against our wishes , "" Karzai said , using some of his harshest language to date against the US - led military coalition . ""
The United States and its allies , Nato , continue to demand even after signing the BSA they will have the freedom to attack our people , our villages .
The Afghan people will never allow it . ""
Separately , in an interview with the BBC 's Newsnight programme , Karzai – who is serving his final six months in office – hit back at previous remarks by Barack Obama , the US president , who has described his Afghan counterpart as unreliable and ineffective .
"" They want us to keep silent when civilians are killed .
We will not , we can not , "" said Karzai .
Nato says the Nangarhar attack was retaliation for insurgents trying to mortar the base and while it believed no civilians were hurt , it had opened an investigation into the incident .
Karzai said he will convene a council of elders in one month to help him make a decision on the pending security agreement .
The US wants a deal by the end of October to give American and Nato military planners enough time to prepare for keeping troops in the country after the scheduled 2014 withdrawal instead of a total pullout similar to the one in Iraq .
Karzai told Newsnight that his priorities included bringing the Taliban back into government under a power - sharing agreement .
"" They are Afghans .
Where the Afghan president , the Afghan government can appoint the Taliban to a government job they are welcome , "" he said .
"" But where it 's the Afghan people appointing people through elections to state organs then the Taliban should come and participate in elections . ""
He rejected the idea that womens ' interests would be harmed by bringing the Islamist hardliners back into power .
"" I have no doubt that there will be more Afghan young girls and women studying and getting higher education and better job opportunities .
There is no doubt about that ; even if the Taliban come that will not end , that will not slow down . """
2013-10-08,"Coming from a man who owes his job and probably his life to US and British military support , President Hamid Karzai 's stinging criticisms of Nato 's performance in Afghanistan may seem a little hypocritical .
But with western politicians and generals busily conspiring to declare the 12-year war a success ahead of next year 's withdrawal , Karzai 's comments are a salutary reminder that all is far from well in Afghanistan – and that things could turn very messy , very soon .
Karzai 's main point – that Nato operations have caused "" great suffering and loss of life "" among the Afghan civilian population and have failed to secure the country – is difficult to dispute .
It is one of those uncomfortable home truths that western leaders intent on justifying the human and material cost of the 2001 intervention , and on getting out on schedule , just do not want to hear .
Time and time again , Karzai has angrily denounced military strikes that accidentally killed civilians , and complained that US forces override or ignore Afghan sovereignty .
After the most recent incident on Friday , Karzai weighed in again in person . ""
President Karzai strongly condemned the Nato air strike in which he says five civilians , including three students aged 10 , 14 and 16 , were killed in eastern Nangarhar province on Friday night , "" a statement from Karzai 's palace said .
Civilian casualties are reportedly on the rise again after falling back .
Figures collated by the Guardian suggest a total of 14,728 civilians have died in the past six years , though vastly more were killed by the Taliban than by Nato .
Rising losses among the nearly 350,000-strong Afghan army and police , and a desertion rate of about 50,000 a year , also support Karzai 's contention that control of large parts of the country remains tenuous .
Nato generals are adamant they are on course for a smooth handover of security responsibilities by December 2014 .
The top British commander in Afghanistan , Lt Gen John Lorimer , said in June the Afghan military was proving an "" effective force "" that was "" going on the front foot "" against the insurgents .
But last year about 10 times as many Afghan army and police were killed compared with Nato troops , and the figures this year are believed to be even higher .
Some Afghan politicians and independent analysts believe another civil war is inevitable once Nato leaves and that , whatever western leaders say , the Kabul government will be powerless to prevent it .
Karzai 's outburst is the product of other frustrations , including his belief that the US engaged in "" duplicitous "" behaviour in attempting to engage Taliban elements in peace talks , ostensibly behind his back .
Karzai says he wants an accommodation with the Taliban before he is obliged to stand down after next April 's presidential poll – but understandably wants to do so on his terms , not Washington 's .
Karzai and the Obama administration are also at odds over post-2014 security arrangements , with no agreement yet on a renewed bilateral security agreement ( BSA ) or a continued non - combat Nato presence .
One problem is that US policymakers and commentators differ over Afghanistan 's strategic importance .
Some believe a stable , pro - western Pakistan is a more vital American interest – another irritant for Karzai , who has often clashed with Islamabad and claims that Afghan insurgents operate with impunity from Pakistani bases .
Bad feeling in Washington about Karzai stems partly from the steep cost of supporting the Afghan economy and the endemic official corruption and drug - peddling that has damaged his government 's reputation .
His frankness has frequently prompted a sharp US response .
In 2009 , Barack Obama reportedly called Karzai an ineffective and unreliable partner .
And Washington Post journalist and author Bob Woodward , a White House insider , told CBS in 2010 that Karzai suffered mental health problems .
"" Karzai is a diagnosed manic depressive , somebody who has mood swings .
Sometimes it 's controlled , sometimes it 's not .
If you just look at what he has said in public and on the record , you know , one moment he 's totally embracing us , the next moment he 's denouncing the United States , "" Woodward said .
"" Karzai seems determined to exit having left the equivalent of a poison pill to his successor , "" said Anthony Cordesman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies .
"" He has never been willing to come to grips with the military realities shaping the war … Almost every week he creates a new and unnecessary problem in US and Afghan relations , evidently on the assumption that the US … has serious rather than marginal strategic interest in Afghanistan . ""
Whatever the Americans say , Karzai 's latest broadside looks like the beginning of an increasingly problematic , dangerous countdown to April 's presidential election , which features no obvious successor and far too many unsettling echoes of the pre-2001 past .
Among the candidates and their running mates are former warlords including Ismail Khan , General Abdul Rashid Dostum , and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf , the man who invited Osama bin Laden to set up shop in Afghanistan in 1996 .
Western countries will probably be rooting for the former foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , who was runner - up in the 2009 election .
Their support could prove fatal to his cause .
No one knows what the poll 's outcome will be or what will ensue .
But by this time next year , Obama and others may have cause to miss their old sparring partner Karzai ."
2013-10-12,"Reports that the US arrest of a senior Taliban commander was carried out despite his being in the custody of the Afghan government threatened on Saturday to overshadow talks between the US secretary of state , John Kerry , and Afghan president Hamid Karzai .
The talks are part of a last - ditch effort to negotiate a security pact which would determine , among other things , how many US troops stay in the country after 2014 .
Kerry and Karzai said later on Saturday that major issues over a bilateral security agreement had been resolved but the question of immunity for US troops would have to be decided by a assembly of elders and leaders .
One sticking point in the talks had been a US request to run independent counter - terrorism missions on Afghan territory .
On Saturday , however , the Afghan government said the US had seized a senior Pakistani Taliban leader , Latif Mehsud , from Afghan intelligence agents attempting to recruit him .
On Friday a State department spokeswoman , Marie Harf , said US forces had captured Mehsud , whom she described as a senior commander with Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan , also known as Tehriq - e - Taliban Pakistan .
She said the group had claimed responsibility for the attempted 2010 bombing of Times Square in New York , as well as many attacks within Pakistan .
Harf did not say when Mehsud 's arrest happened or where he was being held .
A spokesman for Karzai , told the Washington Post Mehsud had been taken by the US from a government convoy in the east of the country .
The spokesman said : "" The Americans forcibly removed him and took him to Bagram . ""
Earlier on Saturday , regarding the talks , Kerry told reporters and US embassy staff : "" We will try to see if we can make a little more progress , which we have been doing . ""
Karzai 's spokesman told reporters : "" There are still issues we are finalizing , therefore there is a need for a third round of talks this evening . ""
Kerry told US Embassy staff after the meetings recessed that "" we 've had a terrific day .
We 're going back to the palace to enjoy dinner with the president and more importantly we 're going to see if we can make a little more progress , which is what we have been trying to do all day long .
"" If this thing can come together , this will put the Taliban on their heels , "" he added .
"" This will send a message to the community of nations that Afghanistan 's future is being defined in a way that is achievable . ""
While the US is keen to conclude the negotiations quickly , the Afghan president has said the pact can wait until after the country 's elections , which are due in April .
Progress towards an agreement was made on the first day of talks , on Friday , according to both Afghan and US officials .
Most foreign combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and without a deal the United States could pull out all of its forces in an outcome known as the "" zero option "" , which was unthinkable until a few months ago .
The collapse of similar talks between the US and Iraq in 2011 – triggered partly by Baghdad 's refusal to provide immunity to US soldiers serving there – led to the US pulling its troops out of the country .
Afghan security has been deteriorating , increasing worry about the country 's prospects after western forces leave .
On Saturday , a car bomb killed four people in the eastern city of Jalalabad .
Efforts to draw the Taliban into negotiations have come to nothing .
The militants say they will fight on until all foreign forces leave and they dismiss Karzai as a US "" puppet "" ."
2013-11-20,"The US and Afghanistan governments have reached terms on a deal that would ensure an American presence in the war - ravaged country beyond the formal 2014 end of combat .
US secretary of state John Kerry , who had been in difficult long - distance negotiations with Afghan president Hamid Karzai throughout the week , announced the agreement in Washington on Wednesday , ahead of a large - scale national gathering in Kabul expected to give Karzai wider political cover for agreeing to a residual US presence in Afghanistan .
The deal , known as the Bilateral Security Agreement , ensures that a rump US force will continue to train , advise and equip the roughly 350,000 Afghan soldiers , police and airmen that it has assembled almost from scratch over the last half decade .
A draft accord published on the Afghan government ’s website holds that the US shall not conduct any combat operations “ unless otherwise mutually agreed ” , but appears to give them relatively wide leeway for the counter - terror missions that are a priority for Washington .
US commanders and politicians have said their forces will try to tackle al - Qaida but only train and equip Afghans to fight the Taliban , leaving them to fight alone after 2014 .
The final deal came only hours before around 3,000 elders , power brokers and other delegates from around the country meet to discuss the deal and ultimately vote on whether Karzai should sign it .
The hand - picked representatives are widely expected to approve the agreement , after airing opposition views .
The agreement paves the way for the longest US conflict in history – one launched in the weeks after September 11 and which has claimed 2,153 US military lives and tens of thousands of Afghan civilian lives – to enter a murkier phase .
Left out of the accord is the war ’s other principal combatant .
Years of furtive efforts to broker talks with the Taliban have not achieved any tangible results , and the insurgent group have vowed to keep fighting while there are any foreign boots on Afghan soil .
While US , UK and Nato combat will formally end , the US will subsequently negotiate a residual force of as - yet undetermined size , to be stationed throughout a handful of Afghan military bases , as well as some bases of which the accord grants the US “ exclusive use .
”
Pentagon sources have said in the past year that Bagram , Kandahar , Jalalabad and Mazar - e - Sharif are on the list of potential bases .
Marine General Joseph Dunford , the US / Nato military commander in Afghanistan , is said to favor a post-2014 force of roughly 10,000 to 13,000 troops , about a fifth of the current US deployment .
The draft text published by the Afghans explicitly states that “ US military operations to defeat al - Qaida and its affiliates may be appropriate in the common fight against terrorism , ” leaving the door open both to US raids , probably by special operations forces , after 2014 .
“ US military counter - terrorism operations are intended to complement and support [ Afghan ] counter - terrorism operations , with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people , including in their homes , ” the draft text reads .
There is also a concession to Afghan demands that the US offer guarantees against external aggression , but the language is vague indicating the US would have “ grave concern[s ] ” over attacks by foreign entities into Afghanistan – most likely from Pakistan – but not committing to any specific military response .
The draft sidesteps the question of drones based on Afghan soil .
They have been used for strikes in neighbouring Pakistan , and are expected to continue to launch missions from the range of bases offered to US force under the deal .
The language about the sanctity of the Afghan homes has been among the most controversial in the document , as has assurances the US demands that it will have the exclusive legal jurisdiction and control over any US personnel suspected of committing crimes in Afghanistan .
Earlier on Wednesday , the State Department strongly denied that the US would issue any apology to Afghanistan over mistakes made in the 12-year old war .
Jen Psaki , the top State Department spokeswoman , said earlier reports of a forthcoming apology were erroneous , but added it was possible that the US would provide “ reassurances ” to Afghanistan “ addressing past issues , such as civilian casualties ” .
Although the accord paves the way for a residual US force in Afghanistan on an open - ended stay , it represents a political victory for the Obama administration , which had vowed to a domestic US audience it would bring the war to a conclusion .
Pending the Afghan loya jirga ’s anticipated approval of the accord , the deal contrasts sharply with the 2011 exit of practically all US troops from Iraq – a circumstance forced onto Washington by an Iraqi government that would not permit the US to prosecute its own forces , a deal - breaker for the Pentagon .
Instead , whatever comes of the longest US war in history will come by diplomatic accord between Washington and its erstwhile Afghan ally ."
2013-11-21,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has reluctantly urged his countrymen to let US forces stay on in the country for another decade , saying that although there is no trust between him and Washington , a small American military presence is Afghanistan 's best hope of stability .
But Karzai told a grand assembly gathered to vote on a draft security pact between the two nations that even if they approve it , he might leave the deal to be signed by his successor as president next year .
This is likely to unnerve American officials who want their future role settled .
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Barack Obama wants the security pact approved and signed by Afghanistan 's government by the end of this year .
"" We hope that they will move quickly to approve the text of that agreement , "" Earnest said .
US defence secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters that Karzai 's move "" puts the United States in a very , very difficult position "" . ""
Until we get that BSA ( bilateral security agreement ) , we ca n't do any more than train and it really needs to be done by the end of this year , "" Hagel said .
It was not clear how serious Karzai was about a delay .
A master of brinkmanship , the Afghan leader has used ultimatums to squeeze concessions from his western backers in the past , but has also smoothly stepped away from red lines when sensing defeat , including bowing this year to a US demand that its troops be granted immunity from the Afghan judicial system .
Addressing 2,500 delegates gathered from across Afghanistan for the loya jirga – a hybrid of tribal tradition and modern referendum –
Karzai urged them to think of future generations .
"" Where is the advantage in this agreement ?
Why should we sign it ?
"" he asked a gathering where a mix of turbans and striped silk chapan coats , pakool hats from the Panjshir valley and colourful headscarves showcased the country 's diversity .
"" It gives us the opportunity to move from our current situation to a stable situation , "" he said .
Karzai read out to delegates a letter he said came from Obama , promising respect .
"" We will continue to make every effort to respect the sanctity and dignity of Afghans , in their homes and in their daily lives , just as we do for our citizens , "" a copy shared by presidential aides read .
There was high drama before the opening , with the wording of the deal only pinned down hours before the crowd flooded into the purpose - built hall , thrown up a few years ago to replace a recycled Oktoberfest tent that hosted the first loya jirga after the Taliban 's fall .
The bilateral security agreement paves the way for up to 15,000 foreign troops , more than half of them American , to stay on in nine bases across Afghanistan until 2024 .
Nato combat forces will leave at the end of next year , and the agreement is vital to ensuring Afghans get the funds and training they need to support a relatively weak military .
The US troops will also use their bases to chase al - Qaida and linked groups along the Pakistani border .
Although the loya jirga technically has a deciding vote on the future of the deal , the four - day meeting is expected to be more political theatre than a real test , as Karzai , with one eye on his legacy , seeks to spread the political risk of signing off on a long - term US presence .
"" What comes out pretty clearly when you talk to people who are on the organising committee or ordinary delegates [ is that ] pretty much everyone is in favour of the Americans having a troop presence .
Not absolutely everyone , but there is a surprising consensus ,
"" one western diplomat said.""If
that 's the overwhelming picture , then surely Karzai is going to get that through in some way . ""
The elaborate choreography of Karzai 's opening speech was briefly interrupted by a senator from western Afghanistan who accused him of selling out the country with a deal to allow US forces to enter Afghan homes in "" exceptional circumstances "" when their lives are at risk .
"" Every situation is serious for them , "" said Belquis Roshan .
"" All those people who have been killed by American soldiers were exceptions.""She was escorted out of the room by security , and two later interruptions from the crowd were to praise the president , one with shouts of : "" Long live Karzai ! ""
The question of whether foreign soldiers should be allowed to enter Afghan homes on military missions , considered a gross violation of privacy here , had been the cause of last - minute delays to the draft and was a main focus of Karzai 's speech .
He Karzai had originally called for an absolute ban , unless the US apologised for past mistakes , but eventually conceded to Washington 's demands .
It may have been heartfelt , as Karzai has long been a staunch advocate of barring western soldiers from Afghan houses , but it was also politically astute before a conference at which delegates include the relatives of civilians killed by both the Taliban and Nato forces .
The dispute shifted the focus of his speech away from the US requirement that their troops have immunity from the Afghan judicial system , which is highly emotive .
The Afghan leader said he had canvassed regional powers , including India , China and Russia , as well as the government of Pakistan and all of them except Iran had urged him to sign the security pact for the sake of Afghanistan 's future .
He finished what is likely to be one of the most significant speeches of his career with a familiar political appeal , to delegates ' concerns for their children .
His own son , he said , had learned the words "" ministry of defence "" as a toddler , after the building near the palace came under attack . ""
In what country is that normal ? "" he said .
"" It will be better for our future if we sign this agreement . ""

2013-11-22,"The tumultuous relationship between Washington and Kabul plunged back into crisis hours after leaders from both sides pinned down the final details of a long - term military co - operation pact , which was expected to put a seal on a year of difficult negotiations .
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , blindsided US diplomats – and reportedly some of his own advisers – with a suggestion on Thursday that the bilateral security agreement , even if approved , should only be signed after presidential elections next year .
A spokesman for the US president , Barack Obama , responded hours later with a warning that the deal must be signed before the end of this year for the Pentagon to plan its mission in Afghanistan after the final combat troops head home next year .
Failure to finalise a deal would "" prevent the United States and our allies from being able to plan for a post-2014 presence in Afghanistan "" , the White House spokesman Josh Earnest said .
The draft pact is being pored over this week by a loya jirga , or grand assembly , in Kabul of hand - picked delegates from around the country who are largely in favour of the deal and are expected to approve it in a nominally independent vote .
It was expected to be a largely ceremonial seal on a complex process , spreading the political risk of acceding to another decade of US soldiers on Afghan soil away from a president always wary of being branded a US puppet .
But in his opening speech to 2,500 delegates , and after reluctantly commending the pact , Karzai suggested it should only be signed after his successor is chosen in next April 's poll .
He can not stand again .
"" This pact should be signed when the election has already taken place , properly and with dignity , "" he said .
Still , Karzai has stepped away from ultimatums before , most recently a demand for an absolute ban on US forces entering Afghan homes , and most of the heavyweight candidates vying to replace him are likely to support the pact .
The loya jirga could also potentially call on him to sign the deal now .
The agreement is vital to secure the $ 4bn annual funding Afghan security forces will need after 2014 , and training for a still weak and badly equipped force .
For Washington it allows counter - terrorism forces to pursue al - Qaida and linked groups along the border , and support a decade of investment in lives and money .
Without it no other nations will leave troops in Afghanistan after 2014 , as they need American political backing and on - the - ground support from medical evacuation to food supplies ."
2013-11-24,"A security pact with the US , which is critical to Afghanistan 's ability to pay its soldiers and hold off the Taliban , is in limbo , after President Hamid Karzai shrugged off the recommendations of a national council that has approved the deal and said he would continue talks with Washington .
After a year of negotiations , the Loya Jirga , or grand assembly , of 2,500 delegates approved the agreement to keep US troops in the country after the current combat mission ends in 2014 .
But Karzai stunned US diplomats and many of his own security officials when he told the opening session of the jirga that the bilateral security agreement should not be signed until after presidential elections in April .
Washington quickly announced that a deal had to be agreed by the end of the year , but on Sunday Karzai said that the US had to prove its good intentions by keeping its soldiers out of Afghan homes , ensuring the vote was transparent and promoting peace talks with the Taliban . ""
If I sign and there is no security , then who is going to be blamed for it ? ""
he told delegates , who interrupted his speech several times to both question and support him .
The agreement will allow US soldiers to stay on at nine bases , mentoring the still ill - equipped and patchily trained Afghan police and army , and pursuing al - Qaida and linked groups .
It is politically sensitive for many reasons , not least because it undermines Afghanistan 's reputation as the "" graveyard of empires "" , with the ignominious withdrawal of Soviet forces referenced several times in jirga speeches on Sunday .
But without a deal , the US is unlikely to part with the $ 4bn ( £ 2.50bn ) a year needed to pay the Afghan army , or provide the helicopters and other equipment promised .
Many Afghans feel that the imperfect deal is the only protection they have against powerful neighbours .
One of Karzai 's security advisers warned parliament that without the agreement the country would be isolated "" among wolves "" , and his military chief asked opponents of the deal to say where else they would come up with police and army funding .
At the end of the Loya Jirga , which has no legally binding powers , a string of delegates came up to the podium to commend the deal , some to ask for small changes , but the majority to urge Karzai to sign the agreement by the end of year .
Karzai chose to ignore those requests , warning his audience that "" Afghanistan has always won the war but lost in politics "" .
He added that he planned to carry on with negotiations because the US had broken previous commitments to protect the country and support the peace process . ""
Lack of trust is the core of the problem , "" his spokesman , Aimal Faizi , said before the speech , adding that Karzai thought American officials were bluffing when they warned of a total pullout by the US .
"" We do n't believe there is a zero option , "" he said .
But many in Washington and Afghanistan fear Karzai is underestimating the exhaustion of both the US public and the Obama administration with a long and costly war , and that he is taking a huge risk by delaying the deal .
After Karzai finished , Sebghattulah Mojaddidi , the chairman of the gathering , took to the podium again to give an emotional speech aimed at the leader who he said is like "" my own child "" .
Afghanistan had kicked out a superpower before , Mojaddidi said , and could do the same if they did not stick to their side of the deal . ""
This is good for us .
If the Americans do n't follow the agreement , I will be responsible . ""
Mojaddidi warned that he would go into voluntary exile if Karzai did not sign the deal .
The US embassy in Kabul declined to comment on the status of the agreement .
"" We are studying the president 's remarks .
We continue to believe that concluding the agreement as soon as possible is in the interests of both nations , "" a spokesman said ."
2013-11-26,"Afghan president Hamid Karzai has proposed new terms for a deal governing troop withdrawal from Afghanistan , according to the White House .
After his meeting on Monday with US national security adviser Susan Rice , a spokesman said : "" President Karzai outlined new conditions for signing the agreement and indicated he is not prepared to sign the bilateral security agreement ( BSA ) promptly . ""
Karzai has persistently raised questions about the pact , which would enable US troops to operate in the country beyond next year .
An assembly of Afghan elders on Sunday endorsed the deal and advised Karzai to sign it promptly .
However , he said he would wait until after a presidential election due next April .
There should be peace in Afghanistan before the deal is signed , he said .
In Kabul , Karzai 's spokesman said the Afghan president wanted the United States to halt all military operations on civilians ' homes and return Afghan citizens held in the Guantánamo prison camp before the pact was signed .
Rice , who made a three - day visit to Afghanistan to visit US troops , told Karzai it was not viable to defer signing the deal until after the election , the White House said , adding : "" It would not provide the United States and Nato allies the clarity necessary to plan for a potential post-2014 military presence .
Without a prompt signature , the US would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no US or Nato troop presence in Afghanistan . ""
US troops have been in Afghanistan since 2001 .
Karzai 's office said he asked Rice for further assurances from the United States that its forces will not raid Afghan homes and called on America to express a sincere commitment to help start stalled peace talks with the Taliban .
He also reiterated his demand that the US commit to holding free and transparent elections on 5 April and asked Rice to convey his concerns about the raids and peace talks to President Barack Obama so that he could "" give assurances regarding the issues to the Afghan people . ""
Obama sent a letter to Karzai last weekassuring him that , under the agreement , the US would continue to respect "" Afghan sovereignty "" and the US military would not conduct raids on homes except under extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risks to US nationals .
The US has repeatedly urged Karzai to sign a deal that would allow about 8,000 American troops to stay in the country beyond a 2014 withdrawal deadline ."
2013-11-28,"Afghanistan 's government has backed away from a proposal to reintroduce public stoning as a punishment for adultery after the leak of a draft law stirred up a storm of international condemnation .
The president , Hamid Karzai , said in an interview that the grim penalty , which became a symbol of Taliban brutality when the group were in power , would not be coming back .
"" It is not correct .
The minister of justice has rejected it , "" he told Radio Free Europe , days after the UK minister Justine Greening urged him to prevent the penalty becoming law .
Afghanistan 's penal code dates back over three decades .
The government is drawing up a new one to unify fragmented rules and cover crimes missed out when the last version was written , such as money laundering , and offences that did not even exist at the time , such as internet crimes .
The justice minister presiding over the reform is an outspoken conservative who last year denounced the country 's handful of shelters for battered women as brothels .
As part of the process , a committee tasked with looking at sharia law came up with draft legislation that would have condemned married adulterers to the slow and gruesome death ; unmarried people who had sex would be flogged .
But after several days of silence in the face of growing international outcry , the justice ministry said in a statement that although stoning had been proposed it would not appear in the new legislation because there was "" no need to regulate the issue "" .
The country 's penal code already encompasses sharia law , but some controversial aspects of traditional punishments such as stoning have never been put on the books in Afghanistan . ""
The legality of the crime and punishment is fully addressed and there is no need to regulate the issue in the new code .
So , the ministry of justice does not intend to regulate it in the new draft code , "" the statement said .
Rights groups who first highlighted the draft law warned that although the government 's quashing of the proposal was good news , its emergence in the first place was a sign of how fragile gains in human rights over the last decade had been , particularly for women .
Although stoning is listed as a punishment for adulterers of both sexes , in countries where it has been used in recent years women have often appeared on the execution ground alone .
As foreign troops head home before a 2014 deadline for the end of combat action in Afghanistan , and political attention fades with it , many activists fear that years of painstaking progress are at risk of being swept away .
"" Of course it 's a huge relief that the government appears eager to disown this proposal now , but this is not an aberration that appeared out of the blue , "" said Heather Barr of Human Rights Watch .
"" It is just the latest in a long string of efforts to roll back women 's rights over the last half year , many of which have been successful .
It is time for donors to wake up and realise that if there is not constant pressure on the Afghan government to respect women 's rights , there will be no women 's rights . """
2013-11-29,"The United States has moved to end the tense standoff with Afghan president Hamid Karzai over his refusal to sign a security pact between the two countries by formally apologising for a US drone strike in Helmand province that killed a toddler and injured two women .
The apology was delivered in a phone call to Karzai late on Thursday by marine General Joseph Dunford , the top US and Nato commander in Afghanistan .
A spokesman for Dunford told Associated Press that the commander had spoken directly to Karzai and "" expressed deep regrets for the incident and any civilian casualties "" that had arisen from the airstrike earlier on Thursday .
Dunford also promised an immediate investigation by Nato into the incident .
The US - Afghan bilateral security agreement ( BSA ) was endorsed at a loya jirga ( national gathering ) convened by Karzai last week , which was expected to finalise the deal after a year of painful negotiations .
A letter from US president Barack Obama – which Karzai had demanded and read from at the opening ceremony – said the US had already "" redoubled our efforts to ensure that Afghan homes are respected by our forces "" and continued to "" make every effort to respect the sanctity and dignity of Afghans in their homes and in their daily lives , just as we do for our own citizens "" .
But the Afghan president then stunned both his own allies and American officials by announcing he would not sign the pact until after presidential elections next year to choose his successors .
He also laid out new conditions for America to meet , including freeing all Afghan prisoners from Guantánamo Bay and ending raids on Afghan homes .
Thursday 's bombing will make it even harder for Karzai to sign the pact , as it compounds earlier US violations of Afghan trust by betraying Obama 's promises just days after they were made , Karzai 's spokesman , Aimal Faizi , told the Guardian .
"" That is how the US respects the sanctity and dignity of homes in the US , bombing a residence for an individual ?
It is just another example of not fulfilling the commitments of the past by the US , "" Faizi said .
"" We want an immediate halt or end to all military operations on Afghan homes otherwise it will further delay the signing of BSA , which will not be in our mutual interests . ""
A coalition official who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject denied that the bomb hit a home .
He said it was aimed at an insurgent travelling on a motorbike along a stretch of road with no homes nearby .
The target was a mid - level commander who smuggled guns and homemade bombs to insurgents in Helmand .
He was killed by a second bomb launched soon after the first missed him , but hit the civilians .
After a series of disastrous airstrikes that killed hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan , including dozens siphoning fuel off a stolen tanker and others gathered for a large wedding party , Nato has more recently tightened procedures for bombings to try to limit deaths .
The number of civilian deaths from airstrikes fell by more than one third in the first half of this year , but around 50 people were kiled , according to United Nations statistics .
Overall , the Taliban and other insurgent groups were responsible for three - quarters of civilian casualties ."
2013-12-02,"The Taliban have urged the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , to turn a delay in signing a long - term security deal with the United States into outright rejection , in an unusually polite statement directed at a leader the insurgents have repeatedly denounced as a US puppet .
Karzai last month called a national assembly to vote on the bilateral security agreement ( BSA ) and then shocked most of the country , including some of his closest advisers , by ignoring the advice of the handpicked group that he sign as soon as possible .
The deal would allow US forces to stay on past the 2014 end of the current combat mission , and seal billions of dollars a year in funding for the Afghan police and military .
Karzai 's delaying tactics stirred widespread condemnation from many in the Kabul elite worried about how the country would fight the Taliban without foreign funds or back - up .
The Taliban on Monday offered the Afghan leader rare , if somewhat grudging , support for his position so far , but also demanded that he abandon all conditions and reject the pact unilaterally . ""
Karzai , the president of the Kabul administration , apparently conditionally refused to sign the BSA , "" the emailed statement from spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said .
"" If he truly understands the real ( situation ) , he should reject it without conditions , from a sense of Afghan spirit . ""
The decision of the Afghan nation is clear : they do n't want any occupier in our homeland . ""
The insurgent group 's statement came on the day Iraq 's foreign minister visited Kabul and admitted that his country still needs "" continued US support "" to combat widespread sectarian violence , even though it turned down a deal for long - term military support two years ago .
The last American soldiers pulled out of Iraq in 2011 after the two countries failed to agree a pact similar to the one Afghanistan is now being offered .
The sticking point was Baghdad 's refusal to grant immunity from Iraq law to US troops .
"" Our expectation of the government of Afghanistan is to sign the BSA with the US , because Afghanistan needs US support , "" Tolo television station quoted minister Hoshyar Zebari telling Afghan journalists .
Karzai has said he will not sign the BSA until after a presidential election to choose his successor next year – he can not stand again – and recently listed a range of new demands , from an immediate halt of all raids on foreign homes to the release of all Afghan prisoners held at Guantanamo day .
The US has said that the negotiations are finished , and Karzai must make a decision by the end of the year , to allow time for planning either a troop departure or the shape of the follow - up presence , expected to be around 8,000 to 10,000 US forces and a smaller number from Nato allies .
If the deal is not signed , all foreign soldiers will leave when the current combat mission ends in 2014 , and most of a promised $ 8 billion a year in military and development aid is likely to vanish .
A still - weak army that relies on foreign training and back - up would be on its own in the fight against the Taliban .
Karzai 's close advisers , including spokesman Aimal Faizi , have said they do not believe there is really a "" zero option "" of withdrawing all troops , and the US is trying to intimidate a poorer , weaker ally .
But US politicians , diplomats and analysts warn that after years of mostly outfoxing his foreign backers when the Afghan war was a top policy priority , Karzai may have severely miscalculated the mood in an economically strained US , and a White House distracted by other international crises from Syria to China .
Tensions between the United States and Afghanistan flared up further in the past few days after a Nato airstrike killed a young boy in Helmand province .
The Afghan leader 's office said that attack was a betrayal of a promise by US President Barack Obama that his forces would respect Afghan civilians as they do their own citizens .
At the weekend Karzai also accused the US of cutting off fuel supplies to the police and army in a bid to force him into signing the pact .
The Nato - led coalition denied any halt in flows of diesel or gasoline vital to patrols and military operations against the Taliban .
"" We are aware of a statement on the Afghan presidential website concerning issues with fuel provisions for the Afghan National Security Forces ( ANSF ) , "" spokesman David Simons said in an email .
There has been no stoppage in the delivery of requested fuel and we continue to process all orders as soon as they are received from the ANSF . ""
According to the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction , the American government paid more than $ 1.1 billion to fuel the Afghan army from 2007 to 2012 , the Associated Press reported .
It plans to spend more for fuel until 2018 , but only if a security deal is signed .

2013-12-04,"Hamid Karzai is kind of a diplomatic pain in the ass .
Karzai has become an expert at sticking his finger in the eye of the United States – the same nation that has expended significant blood and treasure to keep him in power .
Some examples include : once calling the Taliban insurgents ravaging his country "" brothers "" , publicly accusing the United States of working with the Taliban to stage bombing attacks , or declaring that if a war broke between the US and Pakistan , he would side with Pakistan .
But Karzai 's latest gaffe is perhaps his worst and most potentially damaging : namely his continued refusal to sign a bilateral security agreement ( BSA ) with that United States that will keep American troops in the country for the next 10 years .
While this latest action is easy to chalk up as another example of Karzai 's propensity for irrational , eccentric and brinkmanship - like behavior , there is a deeper backstory here .
This blow - up du jour is not some outlier in the US - Afghan relationship , it 's the culmination of years upon years of a poorly conceived US political and military strategy in Afghanistan that has treated Karzai and the Afghan people as a sideshow and collateral damage in the US global war against al - Qaida .
So while Karzai might be a pain in the ass – he 's got a point .
Of course , the question of who is to blame does n't change the fact that Karzai 's current recalcitrance could have potentially disastrous consequences for the country he leads .
Failure to affix his signature to the BSA could lead the US to pursue a so - called "" zero option "" and bring all of its troops home from Afghanistan .
This would have a destabilizing cascade effect .
First , the likely departure of all NATO troops ; and potential cut off of billions in financial assistance from the United States .
Considering that the budget of the Afghan security forces is larger than the revenues brought in by the Afghan government , that could be a serious problem and one that could lead to more instability and an even bloodier civil war than we 've seen over the past several years .
It is small wonder that one of the few political groups in Afghanistan to endorse Karzai 's move is the Taliban .
Why is Karzai playing such a dangerous game of chicken ?
First , he knows that once he signs the BSA , he will lose all leverage with the United States , particularly in regard to the April presidential election that will choose his successor .
Moreover , he appears to truly believe that the US would never actually withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan ( no matter how many times US officials say it ) .
But above all , Karzai simply does n't appear to trust the United States .
None of this puts Karzai in a positive light , and his recent actions are impossible to defend .
But the fight over the BSA is symptomatic of the way in which US policy in Afghanistan has gone far off the rails .
Back in 2008 when Obama was running for president , he pledged to focus his energy on the war in Afghanistan , but he did little to prioritize his relationship with Karzai .
But the real trouble started with the decision to embrace the military 's star - crossed dreams of population - centric counter - insurgency ( COIN ) .
As former US Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry noted in a devastating recent article in Foreign Affairs magazine : Karzai disagreed intellectually , politically , and viscerally with the key pillars of the COIN campaign .
The result was that while American military commanders tirelessly worked to persuade the Afghan president through factual presentation , deference , and occasional humor that the plan was working , they never seemed to consider that Karzai just might not be on board .
As reliant as he was on US aid , Karzai was in little position to resist .
But since the success of any COIN campaign is deeply dependent on aligning the strategy of a host nation with their foreign military supporter , the lack of buy - in from Karzai had a disastrous impact .
Rather than act as a partner in the US effort , Karzai became a constant spoiler .
As US officials tried to make Karzai into something he was n't – a competent , effective and popular leader – it led to more friction , which was further worsened by the increase in civilian casualties from the ramped up US war .
While US officials are right to note that most of these deaths came at the hands of Taliban attacks , the cumulative effect of putting more US troops on the battlefield and stepping up operations meant that more Afghans were going to die .
Yet this has been the consistent failure of Obama 's Afghanistan policy .
The United States identified a military strategy for Afghanistan ( slow the momentum of the Taliban ) and the tactical means of trying to accomplish it ( COIN ) , but offered no serious political strategy to accompany it .
Unable to get Karzai to do what they wanted , they worked around him or simply disregarded him .
When the US finally did begin to tepidly advance a political agenda , Karzai once again played the spoiler – in part fearful that he was being excluded from decisions about the country 's future ( and it must be said his own schizophrenic attitude toward political reconciliation with the Taliban ) .
The fact is , from day one there has been little thought given by this White House as to what would come after the Americans left .
The result is continued military stalemate and little hope , in the near future , of a political settlement .
Indeed , it seems tragically fitting that in the midst of this crisis , a US airstrike last week killed a child in southern Afghanistan – further symbolic evidence of the prioritization of military tactics to the disregard of Afghan politics .
This speaks to the long - standing divergence between Karzai 's interests and those of America 's .
Ultimately , the US sees Afghanistan through the narrow prism of the war on terrorism – and eliminating a potential safe haven for future al - Qaida terrorists .
As Obama coldly noted in 2009 , during the midst of his Afghan policy review , he was n't "" interested in just being in Afghanistan for the sake of being in Afghanistan "" but rather for how it advanced US national security interests .
This mindset placed the security of Americans over that of Afghans .
To protect the former , the US was willing to put the latter in harm 's way .
At the same time , the administration consistently blanched at the potential domestic "" political "" blowback that would comes from jumpstarting a negotiating process with the Taliban , preferring instead to kick the military can down the road to 2014 and US troop withdrawal .
For Karzai , the brunt of the US war on terrorism was being borne by his people with little long - term payoff for Afghanistan .
When he would say "" Al Qaeda was driven out of Afghanistan in 2001 .
They have no base in Afghanistan .
The war against terrorism is not in Afghan villages and is not in the Afghan countryside "" , he was stating an unpleasant truth that was glossed over by US policymakers .
From this perspective , that Karzai 's redline appears to be the entry of US troops into Afghan homes is hardly a coincidence .
In the end , Karzai will likely back down and sign the BSA .
Unfortunately for the Afghan people , while the BSA – and the presence of US troops – may prevent immediately dire consequences , there is little reason for optimism that the country 's 30 + years of civil war will end any time soon .
So while Hamid Karzai might be a mercurial and paranoid leader who has made a bad situation vis - à - vis the United States that much worse , America 's leaders would be wise to look at themselves in the mirror when casting blame .
There 's plenty to go around ."
2013-12-09,"Afghanistan 's presidential election , set for next April and already dogged by allegations of fraud , is likely to be made even more complicated by a second round of voting , a delegation of election experts have said .
Afghanistan 's constitution requires any outright winner to get more than 50 % in an initial poll , otherwise the top two vote winners must compete in a runoff .
With 11 candidates , including powerful ex - ministers , the brother of the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , and relatives of the ousted royal family , most people working on the election have accepted that it will not be settled outright , a delegation organised by the US - based National Democratic Institute found .
"" Virtually everybody , maybe with one exception , thought that a runoff would be very likely , "" said Peter Manikas , NDI 's Asia director , after meeting Karzai , all the candidates , election administrators , civil society activists and others involved with the poll .
The first round is set for 4 April , and the second round should be held two weeks after the final results of that ballot are announced .
Karzai 's term ends in late May , so in theory that provides a deadline for choosing his successor .
But setting up a second poll in a country with a serious insurgency , and infrastructure so weak that in some areas ballots are transported on donkeys , makes that a very tight timetable .
"" There is concern about the timeline for the runoff and the short preparation time , "" Manikas added . ""
[ The independent election commission ] are going to have to , I think , revisit that timeline and see what is realistic . ""
Discussion of a second round may irritate Karzai , whose spokesman has previously cited comments by top US diplomats that they were expecting a second round of voting as evidence of American plans to interfere in the vote .
The last presidential poll in 2009 , which returned Karzai to power , was marred by allegations of widespread fraud .
A dispute between the Afghan leader and his US backers over the results badly damaged ties and has been followed by years of escalating tensions .
The NDI is mostly funded by the US government , and the delegation was led by the US ambassador , Karl Inderfurth , a former assistant secretary of state who first visited Afghanistan more than two decades ago .
But it also included a senior Filipino official from the Asian Network for Free Elections and a former Canadian member of parliament .
The group said that overall they found "" guarded optimism "" that next year 's elections would be better run than those held in 2009 and 2010 , after a series of key reforms including a new legal framework . ""
If broadly viewed by the Afghan people as inclusive and transparent , the upcoming polls could play a pivotal role in advancing stability and democratic development , "" the group said in a statement detailing their findings .
But they also admitted that there had already been controversy about a candidate registration process that had seen the field of would - be presidential contenders narrowed down by half , with little transparency about who was excluded or why .
Many candidates for provincial councils , which will be selected at the same time , were also barred , with little or no explanation , and the voter registration cards needed to validate any candidacy were widely reported to be available for sale on the black market .
"" We are concerned that a number of people who should have been eligible candidates were excluded from the process and some who were ineligible were in fact included , "" said Manikas , adding that there had been a lack of transparency .
"" It was n't a propitious start , "" he told the news conference .
"" It 's extremely important to have observers at every stage of this process . """
2013-12-16,"Ill - advisedly echoing George W Bush 's fatuous Iraq cry of "" mission accomplished "" , David Cameron appears determined that Britain will leave Afghanistan the same way it arrived in 2001 : ignoring the complex internal realities of a desperately poor , highly ungovernable country and blithely oblivious to the dangerous strategic implications of British and allied actions .
Democracy
The internal realities include a government , led by President Hamid Karzai , whose writ barely runs beyond Kabul , and is seriously challenged even there .
Once a favourite of Washington and London , the unpredictable , outspoken Karzai has become a symbol of the perceived unreliability of Nato 's Afghan "" partners "" .
Karzai has accepted untold billions of dollars in western aid , both military and non - military , but has proven a persistent and virulent critic of the western - led military operations that have sustained him in power – while failing to stamp out rampant corruption and the heroin trade .
Understandably , Karzai 's particular bugbear is the many civilian deaths caused in the past decade by US forces and by drone attacks .
Casualties have been rising this year .
But his desire to identify with popular anger at such "" collateral damage "" never led him quite so far as to tell the Americans to get out .
Only now , with national elections due in April and Karzai standing down , does the Afghan leader ostentatiously balk at signing a new status of forces agreement with the US .
This sudden display of political independence presages a security vacuum , but one which he , as ex - president , will not have to face .
Cameron 's self - congratulatory tone notwithstanding , Afghanistan 's democratic institutions remain fragile and highly vulnerable .
If the election process falters or fails , Afghanistan and Nato will face a major crisis .
Security
Despite repeated assertions by British and US commanders , it remains entirely unclear whether the Afghan army and police are equal to the task of continually securing so vast and unruly a country , once direct Nato ground and air support are withdrawn .
The recent spate of "" green on blue "" killings of western troops by their Afghan "" comrades "" has highlighted such doubts .
Nato , the world 's most powerful military alliance , failed to subjugate Afghanistan .
So why the confidence that Afghan security forces – for the most part ill - educated , variably equipped and trained , and divided among themselves on geographical , ethnic , tribal and linguistic lines – can do so ?
The elections will present a major test of the emerging security set - up .
Women 's rights and human rights British troops do have reason to be proud , as Cameron says .
But good causes for which western soldiers bravely fought and died , such as creating and safeguarding the space for extending women 's rights , human rights in general , universal education and child healthcare , are all prospectively under threat in Afghanistan 's uncertain post - Nato future .
""
The Afghan government 's failure to respond effectively to violence against women undermines the already - perilous state of women 's rights , "" Human Rights Watch said in its 2013 report . ""
President Hamid Karzai 's endorsement in March of a statement by a national religious council calling women ' secondary ' , prohibiting violence against women only for ' un - Islamic ' reasons , and calling for segregating women and girls in education , employment , and in public , raises questions about the government 's commitment to protecting women …
"" A series of high - profile attacks on women highlighted the heightened danger that the future holds .
Creating a law- and rights - based society was all part of the nation - building project into which the intervention mission morphed once the al - Qaida camps were dispersed in autumn 2001 .
Nation - building was in fact the main justification for continuing to occupy the country for so long .
This job is hardly begun , and may now unravel .
Terror threat Cameron suggested during Monday 's visit to Camp Bastion in Helmand province that the "" most important part of the mission "" – ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for al - Qaida terrorists , as it was before 9/11 – has been accomplished .
"" Our troops can be very proud of what they have done , "" he said .
But where 's the evidence the terrorists are vanquished ?
The Taliban , who hosted Osama bin Laden , are undefeated and unrepentant .
Various attempts to pursue a peace dialogue with them have gone nowhere .
Mullah Omar remains at large , and ideologically unreformed .
Neighbour Pakistan has been seriously destabilised and radicalised in the past decade .
To the west , Iran remains an implacable foe to pro - western democratic governance .
Once Talib - led Pashtun Sunni Muslims , Afghanistan 's largest homogenous ethnic grouping , have regained control of the south and east of the country in the civil war many believe will follow Nato 's exit , there is good reason to believe they will revive or extend alliances with like - minded groups , including the Pakistani Taliban and other extremist Sunni groups .
al - Qaida could be back within a year .
Cameron , like Barack Obama , can not admit this , of course , as they jointly pull the plug .
Yet by claiming the intervention was mostly about rooting out terrorists , Cameron also ignores or misunderstands , and certainly diminishes , the few , possibly temporary nation - building achievements Britain can point to during its latest , sorry misadventure in Afghanistan ."
2014-01-29,"Each time it seems that fraught ties between Washington and Kabul could not get worse , a new revelation proves the apparent nadir just another waypoint on the road to greater hostility .
The latest is a report that the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , believes many insurgent - style attacks are masterminded by the US .
The Washington Post quoted senior officials inside the presidential palace saying Karzai has kept a list of complex bombings across the country that he suspects were planned by Americans , although the officials also admit they have no firm evidence of a US role .
Topping his list of possible American plots is a recent suicide assault on a high - end restaurant in the Afghan capital , where three American citizens were among the 21 dead .
The idea that Washington is trying to violently undermine a government it has spent billions propping up , while carelessly taking the lives of its own citizens , provoked even the normally temperate US envoy to Kabul into a strong response .
"" It 's a deeply conspiratorial view that 's divorced from reality , "" ambassador James Cunningham told the paper , adding that though he was aware of such allegations he had never heard them directly from the president . ""
It flies in the face of logic and morality to think that we would aid the enemy we 're trying to defeat . ""
Karzai 's spokesman did not respond to requests for comment , but the official quoted by the Washington Post hinted that Karzai believed the US had staged attacks to draw attention away from its own civilian casualties .
A history of disputes including attempts to remove him by skewing an election five years ago , have fed Karzai 's antagonism towards the country that first brought him to power and still pays most Afghan civilian and military bills . ""
The suspicion and the current environment of distrust is framed by the sad experiences of the past , "" the senior official was quoted as saying .
The relationship is no less poisonous on the other side , with one former ambassador on record as saying that Karzai needed medication for mental health problems .
To many in America , the Afghan president 's suspicion of a US role in suicide attacks was further evidence of a loose grip on reality . ""
Every day and in every way , Karzai 's strategic and tactical delusions get more intense , "" said Brookings scholar Vanda Felbab Brown on Twitter as news of Karzai 's list spread . ""
He appears impervious even to input from top Afghans . ""
For all the public sniping , the US values Afghanistan 's strategic location , and the government in Kabul would likely fall without American cash , so the two sides were expected to formally extend their unhappy marriage of convenience by another pragmatic decade .
The US in particular has focused their hopes on working more closely with a new leader , because Karzai must step down as president this year .
They spent months haggling over a deal to keep American troops in the country after Nato 's combat mission ends this year .
Officials in Washington expected to be mapping out the details of a long - term military presence in Afghanistan by now , but instead they are making contingency plans for leaving the country entirely .
The bilateral strategic agreement is in limbo since Karzai surprised even some of his closest advisers by demanding new concessions after a draft was finalised late last year .
Washington says that text is a final offer , and has warned that if it is not signed by Karzai or his successor they would be willing to pull out all forces , as they did in Iraq .
Since Karzai first backed away from the deal , a string of irritants between the two sides have made any kind of rapprochement look more and more distant .
They have sparred repeatedly and in public about the release of 88 men who the US considers dangerous militants , but the Afghan government says are mostly innocent victims , jailed without charges by an unjust foreign army .
Karzai 's wider fears about US meddling were confirmed by revelations from the memoir of former defence secretary Robert Gates that US diplomats had tried to oust the president by manipulating a 2009 election .
Washington had long denied any aim beyond cutting fraud and violence , but Gates described the effort as a "" clumsy and failed putsch "" .
The most recent strain to ties has been reaction to the restaurant bombing and disputed accounts of a US airstrike several days before , both of which killed civilians .
Karzai delayed nearly a full day in condemning the attack on Taverna restaurant just a few hundred metres from his palace , and when he did , his statement took aim at the US airstrike as well .
Among the dead were senior UN officials , and many diplomats bristled at a statement they felt drew tacit analogies between Nato forces supporting Afghan commandos a Taliban .
US forces admit two civilians were killed by the bombing ; the government says the death toll was over a dozen , although officials also conceded the area was too dangerous for a government team to visit .
Then a dossier produced by presidential investigators researching the airstrike was revealed to include at least one image more than four years old , taken after an earlier bombing in another province .
It cast doubt over all the other findings , and concerns were exacerbated by a government - organised press conference with villagers from the area .
They claimed to personally know people in the recycled photograph , taken hundreds of miles away .
The next day , an Afghan television channel interviewed other villagers it said were relatives of the dead .
They claimed the government "" witnesses "" were actually insurgent - linked fighters who had battled US and Afghan soldiers on the day of the airstrike .
The antagonism worries Afghan supporters of a US deal , who fear Karzai is throwing away the country 's best chance of stability .
They include most of the candidates to succeed him as president .
But Karzai 's spokesman insists the president is committed to the deal .
Long - term observers who have watched him shrug off past accusations of madness and outmanoeuvre US diplomats on issues including control of Bagram prison and night raids on Afghan homes , agree .
"" He is playing things very well in these circumstances , he is not crazy at all , "" said one Kabul diplomat .
"" He will sign it probably after the election , and with some conditions .
He knows his future depends on Afghan power brokers and not the Americans … he is playing domestic policy , not international , now . """
2014-01-29,"In Afghanistan weeks of bitter rows between the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , and US diplomats left many people concerned that Barack Obama would use his state of the union speech to row away from long - term support for their country . ""
For me , over the last 12 years … this is the most well - known [ state of the union ] speech among Afghan people , "" said Abdul Waheed Wafa , director of the Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University .
Even people who knew little about US politics were waiting to hear from Obama , he added .
"" Two or three days ago I was at the barber shop and the barber was asking me : ' Hey , I hear there is a big jirga [ traditional gathering of leaders ] in the US .
People are talking about it . '
"" Wafa himself watched the US president 's speech from beginning to end for the first time , and said he and many others were relieved by the promise of long - term backing for Kabul . ""
After 2014 , we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future , "" Obama told Americans .
But he also told the story of a US soldier badly wounded in Afghanistan , promised that "" America 's longest war will finally be over "" this year , and said US troops would only stay on to help Kabul if a long - term partnership deal was signed .
That pact , the bilateral security agreement , has been at the heart of disputes with Karzai , and there are still concerns that if the rows run too close to the current deadline for all US and Nato troops to leave , it could be abandoned .
Without it a promised $ 8bn a year in military and civilian aid would probably dissipate as well .
The US - led mission has often been challenged or resented for issues from causing civilian deaths to heavy - handed meddling in domestic politics and fuelling corruption with multimillion - dollar logistics contracts .
But even critics are concerned that a too hasty departure could leave the Afghan security forces struggling to hold off the Taliban , and jeopardise other gains of the past decade in areas such as education .
Women 's rights advocates such as the outspoken MP Fawzia Koofi are particularly concerned that the departure comes as the country faces a difficult presidential election and change of leader , as the incumbent Karzai must step down in a few months .
"" It 's a very important year …
I hope the withdrawal will be responsible , "" Koofi said after a morning fielding calls from Afghan media about the speech .
"" It could particularly damage women 's situation if not . """
2014-02-02,"The election campaign for Afghanistan 's next president officially kicked off on Sunday , two months before voting opens in a contest already plagued by violence and fraud but still the country 's best hope of a somewhat stable future .
If it goes smoothly the April election will produce the first ever peaceful , democratic transition of power in Afghanistan .
The incumbent , Hamid Karzai , is barred from standing again .

I hardly witnessed these in my lifetime , "" activist Wazhma Frogh , an outspoken critic of the government , said on Twitter .
Posters started going up around Kabul where campaigners defied a light drizzle , the teams unveiled spokesmen and campaign managers , the first rally dates were set , and social media platforms popular with the country 's urban elite were already buzzing with support and criticism .
But the Taliban have vowed to disrupt an election they dismiss as a "" waste of time "" and violence began before the campaigning , with the assassination on Saturday of two men in Herat city .
Presidential hopeful Abdullah Abdullah , a former foreign minister , said they were part of his campaign team , and diplomats were quick to condemn the attack .
"" The attack came at a critical moment for Afghanistan , "" said Jan Kubis , the top UN envoy to Kabul said in a statement .
"" This cowardly action constitutes a violent intimidation of electoral candidates and their supporters , and can not be tolerated . "" All 11 candidates have been issued with three armoured cars and more than 36 police officers as a personal guard for the duration of the campaign , and on Saturday they met members of the Independent Election Commission , which is organising the vote , to discuss security .
The other candidates range from a chatshow host and former airline pilot to the hardline Islamist who first invited Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan , and has an insurgency group in the Philippines named after him .
If none of them can get more than 50 % of the vote on 5 April , a target that seems unlikely with such a wide field , there will be a second round that could push the final announcement of a new leader into the late summer .
Such an outcome worries foreign powers that support the country 's government and military , with hopes that a new leader will sign a long - term security deal to keep American troops in the country .
After negotiating the bilateral security agreement , Karzai surprised Washington but also much of his own cabinet by demanding fresh concessions and refusing to sign .
Without it , promised aid worth billions of dollars is likely to dry up , and even a strong leader would struggle to hold together a country grappling with an insurgency , a feeble economy and massive unemployment , and a flourishing drug trade .
The president in Afghanistan wields huge powers , with little real opposition from a weak , fragmented parliament , and there is currently no frontrunner .
With so much at stake , the race is expected to be intense , and most campaigns say they have already organised teams of monitors to look out for fraud by rivals on polling day .
Campaign spending is officially capped at 10 m Afghanis ( around $ 200,000 ) , but in a country awash with money from opium and a lengthy military contracting boom , few expect that budget to be observed .
The top candidates beside Abdullah include an urbane mujahideen fighter close to assassinated commander Ahmad Shah Massoud and a technocrat intellectual who controversially bolstered his ticket with a popular mujahideen - era commander accused of war crimes , the incumbent 's businessman brother , and another former foreign minister who is the only candidate to have put a woman on his ticket .
Karzai has not yet thrown his backing behind any of the candidates , saying his only contribution will be his single ballot as an Afghan citizen .
But as he intends to stay in Kabul after the vote , living a stone 's throw from the palace , and will be dependent on his successor for security , he is expected to use his political and financial leverage behind the scenes .
The two - month campaign period ends on 2 April , then there is a "" silent period "" before polling day to allow voters to weigh up the campaigns ."

The overview
The election is the third presidential poll since the fall of the Taliban .
It should pave the way for the country 's first - ever peaceful democratic transfer of power , because the constitution bars the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , from standing again .
The fact that Afghanistan has never managed such a handover before is an indication of how fraught the process could be , even without the complication of a raging insurgency .
Karzai has led the country since the fall of the Taliban .
Initially he was appointed by a national assembly , but he went on to win two elections in his own right .
The arrival of a new president after more than a decade will shake up the country 's tiny elite , although the shifts may not be dramatic if the winning candidate is Karzai 's brother or a close ally .
Whoever wins , Karzai will still be living just a stone 's throw from the presidential palace , in a property requisitioned from the United Nations and currently under renovation .
He is not expected to fade into retirement .
The country 's last king was deposed in the early 1970s and only one of the men to lead the country since then has met a natural end .
The macabre track record means Karzai will be keen to ensure the elections produce a successor who will not only respect him , but keep him alive .
He has reportedly rejected the idea of disappearing to a quiet and luxurious exile , even though he would almost certainly find sponsors .
Karzai is not the only fixture about to vanish from the Afghan political scene .
Foreign troops , which have dominated life and politics for over a decade , will also be gone by the start of 2015 .
The new president will have to rely only on his own police and army to keep the Taliban at bay .
If Karzai decides to sign a long - term security deal with the US , there will be a few thousand foreign soldiers still training the Afghan security forces and hunting international militants in the most lawless parts of the country .
He is currently demanding further concessions from the US , and some diplomats have concluded he will not sign the deal .
If he does n't , the future of relations between Afghanistan and the international community that pays for its government and army will hang on the election .
Without the military deal , funding will probably be limited ; the US has already halved its aid budget this year .
And the collapse of the Soviet - backed government in 1992 was precipitated not by the departure of Soviet troops three years earlier but the abrupt halt funds that paid the army 's salaries .
2 .
The candidates There are 11 candidates , ranging from the man who first invited Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan to a chatshow host and retired pilot .
Here are a few details about the frontrunners ( in alphabetical order ) .
Abdullah Abdullah Born 1960 .
An ophthalmologist who swapped surgery for the battlefield as a prominent member of the anti - Soviet resistance , Dr Abdullah , as he is commonly known , is the only serious candidate whose main power base lies outside Afghanistan 's Pashtun ethnic group .
Born to a Pashtun father and Tajik mother in Kabul , much of his standing among Afghans comes from his close ties to the assassinated Panjshiri mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud .
Originally Hamid Karzai 's foreign minister , he resigned in 2005 and four years later surprised many observers by emerging from a messy opposition field to pose the only serious challenge to Karzai , wining enough votes to force a disputed second round in the 2009 poll .
He dropped that challenge but stayed out of government as other contenders took senior posts , focusing instead on building up a grassroots support network .
Afghanistan 's complicated ethnic politics mean he is expected to focus on sweeping to a first - round win , as he would be struggle in a second - round showdown that would potentially unite the Pashtun vote behind another contender .
Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai Born 1949 .
A technocrat intellectual turned nationalist , Ghani is a former finance minister and World Bank official with the most detailed political platform of any candidate , but only a slender political base .
He also campaigned in 2009 and won just 3 % of the vote .
This time he has made a more direct bid for power , allying himself with a controversial but popular former militia commander , Abdul Rashid Dostum , whose solid block of votes could be enough to push Ghani into the second round as the main Pashtun candidate .
The decision to line up beside a man accused of letting hundreds of Taliban prisoners swelter to death in shipping containers , and other war crimes , lost him the support of some young pro - reform voters who are his most obvious constituency .
He countered the criticism by wringing a reluctant but public apology of sorts from Dostum - the first such acknowledgement of civil - war - era wrongs .
Qayoum Karzai Born 1957 .
The president 's older brother , who has none of his mujahideen credentials or political charisma .
He was in the US running restaurants when Hamid was in Pakistan as part of the anti - Soviet movement , only returning after the Taliban 's fall .
Qayoum established a network of profitable businesses in the family 's hometown , but kept a far lower profile than other Karzai brothers – the Kandahar strongman Ahmad Wali and businessman Mahmoud .
But Ahmad Wali was assassinated in 2011 , and Mahmoud has been dogged by his connection to failed the Kabul Bank scandal , leaving Qayoum the most obvious family contender to stay on in the presidential palace .
He has some political experience after winning a seat in parliament in 2005 elections , but resigned when attendance records were published showing he barely turned up .
He has had public spats with his brother , whose support is by no means guaranteed , but his family name and connections could provide formidable help even without the incumbent .
He is believed to have given up US citizenship to run in the election .
Nader Naim Born 1965 .
A grandson of the former King Zahir Shah , whose rule is still remembered by some Afghans as a golden age
, Naim is a relatively young candidate who complains about being ignored by the media .
Born in Afghanistan , but raised in the UK after his grandfather was toppled by his uncle in a bloodless coup , he returned only after the fall of the Taliban .
Working as a secretary to his grandfather , now an ordinary citizen , he built up a wide network of contacts that will bolster his campaign , although it is unclear if he will be able to bankroll a serious bid in what is likely to be an expensive election .
Abdul Rasul Sayyaf Born 1946 .
A former mujahideen leader and hardline Islamist , he is the man who first invited Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan after he was ejected from Sudan .
He also gave his name to the Philippine insurgent group Abu Sayyaf , and the 9/11 commission reports mention him as "" mentor "" to the attack 's mastermind , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
In Afghanistan , his political contributions have included opposing women 's rights provisions and helping pass a bill giving amnesty to those who committed war crimes during the country 's brutal civil war .
He is generally thought to be too hardline to win even in modern Afghanistan , but like Ghani has teamed up with a popular former militia leader – Ismail Khan , commander and then governor of western Herat – who can command a block vote .
Zalmay Rassoul Born 1942 .
An elegant doctor , former foreign minister and distant relative of the deposed king , Rassoul is the only candidate to have a woman on his slate and even after years in government has stayed untainted by the allegations of corruption that have followed so many other officials .
He has known Karzai for decades and they worked together in Rome before the fall of the Taliban .
He is the oldest and – on his own – one of the politically weakest candidates , but many analysts believe he has the current president 's backing , because of their close relationship .
If Rassoul won with Karzai 's support , the current president could potentially continue to exercise considerable power from behind the scenes .
Still , he faces substantial obstacles .
He is not married , which is extremely unusual in conservative Afghanistan , and generally viewed with suspicion .
Although ethnically Pashtun , he has been a Persian speaker all his life , and is reportedly only now learning the language of the people who in Afghanistan 's ethnically charged political scene should be his main supporters .
Gul Agha Sherzai Born 1955 .
A colourful , divisive man , nicknamed "" the bulldozer "" , Sherzai was born the son of a poor restaurant owner and rose to wealth and power as a mujahideen commander .
The governor of southern Kandahar province before the Taliban 's ascent , a time when accusations of abuse were rife , he recaptured the city with help from US forces in 2001 and was reinstated in power .
For years he enjoyed a close relationship with the United States , but it has soured recently over allegations of corruption .
After he moved to eastern Nangarhar province in 2005 , he is reported to have made millions because the job brought control of the lucrative border crossing into Pakistan .
He denies any corruption , and is proud of a nickname he claims is tribute to his ability to get building projects done ; he has widespread popular support won in part by disbursing some of his vast fortune to ordinary people ranging from school teachers to soldiers short of funds for marriage .
3 .
The vote The election is in two rounds , similar to the French system .
If no candidate gets more than 50 % of the vote in the first round – which with 11 candidates is unlikely , unless someone reverts to massive fraud – a second round must be held pitting the top two candidates against each other .
That means that although the poll is set for 5 April , the process could drag on for months .
Getting the ballot papers back from far - flung stations and handling complaints is expected to take weeks , with a final result not due until mid - May .
A second round would take at least six weeks more , probably longer .
So even though the president , Hamid Karzai , is officially due to step down in May , many observers think the country will not get a new leader until July or August at the earliest .
The election is run by the Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) .
Any grievances are handled by the Electoral Complaints Commission , which has already thrown out more than half the would - be presidential candidates for not meeting requirements .
Around 12 million of the country 's estimated 30 million people are eligible to vote , if they have a voter registration card .
But in a worrying sign of challenges ahead , there are potentially around 20 million of these makeshift identity cards in circulation in Afghanistan .
Most were handed out during previous elections , but more than 3 million more were created in a registration drive last year that officially targeted those who had newly turned 18 , lost old cards or returned from abroad .
The system is weak on controls , and the cards , which can be used at any polling station around the country , are easily transferred .
They were for sale long before the election campaign kicked off .
Women 's cards are particularly useful for anyone looking to evade "" one person , one vote "" rules , as they do not have to carry photos out of deference to cultural sensitivities in conservative communities about strangers seeing women 's faces .
There are 6,845 voting centres , and the election organisers say they expect 95 % – 6,431 – to open on polling day .
Still , last time round polling booths in many areas were open but empty , so there is no guarantee of participation .
Casting a ballot involves hours of travelling and serious risks for many Afghans .
Massive fraud in previous elections has left many disillusioned about the process , or at least unwilling to risk their lives .
The Taliban have slammed the election and anyone who participates .
Last year they killed an election official and boasted about it on Twitter .
The group 's leader had already denounced the vote as a "" waste of time "" and said "" pious people "" would not participate .
Security will mostly be provided by Afghan security forces , although the shrinking Nato mission has offered help with logistics , including air transport of ballots and other supplies .
Afghanistan 's rugged mountains , harsh deserts and limited infrastructure mean organisers of past elections have relied heavily on both high - tech air transport and traditional solutions such as donkeys to get ballot papers and boxes to more remote areas .
The election is held at a time when Afghanistan is only just emerging from a bitter winter , but this year has been unusually dry so areas that have been cut off by snow in April of past years are much more likely to be accessible .
4 .
The tactics The election is a wide - open field .
There is no incumbent and no clear frontrunner at present , making the stakes even higher for those who are competing .
Everyone agrees that given the challenges of running an election in Afghanistan , the prize at stake and the budgets some candidates have built up , there will be fraud .
The only question is how much .
Diplomats working on the vote say the result only has to be "" good enough "" – fraud that is not truly outrageous , and a candidate who most Afghans can broadly accept .
They point to elections such as the 1994 poll in South Africa that brought Nelson Mandela to power , when there was corruption but everyone agreed the result matched the will of most people – though Afghanistan is a long way off having its own Mandela figure .
Candidates are likely to be weighing up what combination of condoning and combatting irregularities offers the best chance of victory , and few people believe anyone will stick to the official campaign budget cap of 10 m Afghanis ( £ 107,000 ) .
There will be few independent observers outside big cities , but all campaigns say they will deploy monitors to every voting station they can to look for irregularities .
The complaints process will almost certainly be as hard - fought as the campaign , and plenty of time has been left for candidates to file and settle grievances .
Abdullah Abdullah , who had a Tajik mother and a support base among non - Pashtun northerners , is likely to come top in the first round but only claim victory if he can stagger over 50 % then .
If it goes to a second round , supporters of the main Pashtun candidates are expected to mostly unite – even if reluctantly – around the other candidate and put him ahead .
Karzai has played his cards close to his chest , perhaps to enhance his status as kingmaker or give him a greater chance of a major role in the government of the eventual winner .
He has said several times that his only role in the election will be casting his personal vote , but behind the scenes he is expected to deploy considerable political and financial influence for whoever he backs .
One of the biggest fears for the vote 's overall credibility , and a major concern for some Pashtun candidates , is the risk of an inadvertent ethnic disenfranchisement .
Pashtuns are Afghanistan 's largest ethnic group , though not an absolute majority of the population , and have provided all but one of the country 's leaders over the last hundred years .
But they are also the group from which the Taliban originally hailed , and most live in the south and east , where the insurgency is strong and election violence expected to be high .
There are fears that if Pashtun voters are kept away or scared away from polls in disproportionate numbers , and those who do go to vote elsewhere select a non - Pashtun , it could exacerbate anti - government sentiment and feed support for the insurgency in these areas .
There was a smaller - scale example of this in 2010 parliamentary elections in eastern Ghazni province , where the population is a mix of Hazaras and Pashtuns .
But violence is concentrated largely in Pashtun areas , so all 11 members of parliament selected were Hazara .
The result roiled the province and parliament for months .
But others argue those worries are overstated , pointing out that all the three - person slates for the election are reassuringly multi - ethnic , and there are serious problems with violence in other parts of the country as well that will affect voter turnout .
The insurgency now has supporters of all ethnicities nationwide .
5 .
The in - tray
There will be two main files – poverty and the insurgency – though it is questionable how much power the new leader will have to do much about either problem .
Other major issues will be the flourishing drugs trade and thorny relations with both neighbours and world and regional powers .
Corruption is eating away at Afghan society , already battered by decades of war .
If the new president fails to rein in graft at least a bit , he will struggle to hold on to whatever popular support he garnered to get into office .
The new president will also have to decide what , if anything , to do about opium production , currently at record levels .
It fuels both graft and the Taliban , and a senior UN official recently warned that it risked turning Afghanistan into a fragmented criminal state .
But it is also the main income for many poor farmers , who currently reap little of the multibillion - dollar profits and may have no other options to support their families .
Attempts at eradication have been bloody and unsuccessful overall , so any change is likely to be slow and difficult .
The insurgency is still raging , and the president will have to inspire the security forces , choose generals to lead the fight , and plot tactics to beat a tenacious and experienced enemy .
Many Afghans are fearful the fighting will explode again into a full - blown civil war , ripping apart a decade of development in cities that have stayed relatively calm , such as Kabul and northern Mazar - e - Sharif .
The economy is the elephant in the room .
The government and international community are so focused on the violence that it rarely seems to be a top priority .
Yet the economy 's weakness fuels the insurgency as some of the young people who ca n't find jobs turn to the Taliban , fighting for salaries similar to those offered by the national police and army .
Tax revenue is tiny , the government ca n't pay for itself or its security forces , and there is little hope of that changing unless and until major mining projects still in very early stages of development start up ; the president will have to coax wary investors from planning to actual production .
If Karzai does not sign the bilateral security agreement with the US , the new president will have to decide if he is willing to keep American forces on Afghan soil in return for cash and military support .
He will also have to negotiate difficult relations with neighbours Iran and Pakistan , which both play host to large populations of Afghan refugees , have a keen interest in the country 's affairs , and have for decades poured resources into influencing Kabul , often to the frustration of many Afghans .
Ties with other regional powers may be less fraught , but for a landlocked country are still vitally important , and while Afghanistan is still dependent on foreign aid managing its diplomatic ties to the west and other nations such as Japan that provide substantial support will also be a priority .
6 .
The data Since 2001 , Afghanistan 's GDP has risen annually .
In 2012 , the country 's GDP was $ 20.4bn ( £ 12.4bn ) , a 14 % increase from 2011 .
Inflation Fluctuating prices continue to affect the country .
After a sharp increase in 2011 , the country 's inflation rate dipped slightly in 2012 to 7.2 % .
Unemployment Data on unemployment rates in Afghanistan is weak and controversial , according to an EU National Risk and Vulnerability assessment ( PDF ) , because they fail to capture the situation for most Afghans who are chronically underemployed , working several hours a week , but can not afford to be unemployed .
Civilian casualties
In the first six months of 2013 , 1,319 Afghans died and 2,533 were injured , mostly as a result of improvised explosive devices used by anti - government groups , but also as a consequence of increased fighting in 2013 between those groups and Afghan forces .
Education
The number of children enrolled in Afghan schools has more than quadrupled since 2001 , with 97.4 % enrolled as of 2011 .
Gross enrolment figures include students of all ages , including those who are repeating or are starting school early , and therefore sometimes exceed 100 % .
Drugs
Despite eradication efforts , the total area of Afghan land under opium poppy cultivation rose in 2012 to an estimated 154,000 hectares , an 18 % increase since 2011 and a reflection of relatively stable farm - gate prices and world - wide demand .
The production of opium , however , decreased by 36 % due to a combination of disease and adverse weather in 2011 ."
2014-02-04,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has been talking to the Taliban for several months in an attempt to broker a last - minute peace deal before his term expires , the New York Times reports , citing Afghan and western officials .
If confirmed , the clandestine contacts could explain his hardening stance towards Washington in recent weeks , which has further soured an already difficult relationship .
The outreach to the Taliban began last November , just as Washington believed a deal for a long - term US military presence in Afghanistan was about to be signed .
After a national gathering convened to discuss the bilateral agreement endorsed it , Karzai surprised allies and much of his own cabinet by rolling out a new list of conditions .
The strategic deal is still unsigned , and billions of dollars in military and civilian aid linked to it are also in limbo .
Since then , relations between Kabul and Washington have deteriorated further with the revelation that Karzai suspects the US is behind many insurgent - style attacks , including a recent suicide assault on a restaurant in the Afghan capital that killed prominent members of the international community and two US citizens .
He has also ordered the release of dozens of prisoners considered by the US to be dangerous Taliban fighters .
His office insists they are innocent men locked up by the US under false pretences .
Afghanistan will vote for a new president in April .
But the two - stage system and delays getting ballot boxes from across the country could mean that Karzai will remain in post for several months after .
The contacts with the Taliban do not appear to have yielded any concrete results , the New York Times reported , with neither actual talks nor firm plans for any on the table .
A presidential spokesman confirmed the talks , which he described as among the most serious of the last decade .
"" These parties were encouraged by the president 's stance on the bilateral security agreement and his speeches afterwards , "" Aimal Faizi told the paper . ""
The last two months have been very positive . ""
He was not available for comment on Tuesday .
There were meetings with influential leaders in Dubai and Riyadh , the report said , but contacts had "" fizzled out "" and the group had no plans of negotiating with the Afghan government , if they ever did .
The Taliban have long said getting rid of foreign troops is one of their main objectives , and if their links with Karzai contributed to slow progress on the long - term partnership deal with the US , it could potentially be part of a military strategy .
Although the Taliban maintained unofficial contacts with some senior Afghans over the decade since they were toppled , efforts to broker peace talks to end the conflict through negotiations have been tortuous and so far yielded little more than set - backs and dead ends ."
2014-02-04,"Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan 's president , and Nawaz Sharif , Pakistan 's prime minister , have a lot in common .
Both are doughty political survivors in a tougher - than - average neighbourhood .
Both are embroiled in a love - hate relationship with the US government , which they regularly denounce even as they cling to it for dear life .
And the two men distrust each other with a passion borne of a thousand betrayals .
Now it appears Karzai and Nawaz are pursuing another shared interest : talks with the Taliban – the elusive Rosetta Stone of the 13-year Af - Pak conflict .
According to reports published on Monday , and not denied in Kabul , the Afghan president has been secretly directing peace negotiations with Taliban representatives for months .
This , it is suggested , explains why he has refused to sign a post - withdrawal security pact with Washington .
Karzai 's recent behaviour has indeed been suspicious , even by his eccentric standards .
Even though the pact would ensure continuing billions in western aid and non - combat back - up for Afghan security forces , and although it was approved by an inclusive loya jirga , Karzai has refused to sign up .
This leaves Afghanistan in potentially dangerous limbo .
He has intensified his criticism of Nato over high levels of civilian casualties , despite the fact that the UN says the Taliban are mostly to blame .
He has darkly hinted that western agents ( and former US defence secretary Robert Gates ) were attempting to undermine his authority .
And he has insisted on releasing high - profile Taliban detainees against US advice .
All this seems easier to understand in the context of a successful peace deal , presented as the crowning glory of the Karzai presidency before he steps down in April .
Except Karzai , like the Americans and others before him , appears to have drawn a total blank .
There is no deal with the Taliban , nor even a hint of one in the making .
It is not even clear whether the Taliban - esque figures encountered in various Gulf region capitals speak for Mullah Omar , the Taliban leader .
What is clear , meanwhile , is that the Taliban , whether by crafty design or thanks to Karzai 's dysfunctional relationships , have succeeded in complicating , if not wrecking , President Barack Obama 's 2014 withdrawal scenario .
The Americans , the British and the rest are all still leaving .
But as matters stand , what they leave behind will be even more of a tottering edifice than previously feared .
Karzai 's machinations have , as always , a Pakistani dimension , given his firm conviction , often expressed and partially justified , that Islamabad has deliberately conspired with elements of the Afghan Taliban to destabilise the Kabul government .
Islamabad is said to want a weak , divided Afghanistan that poses no threat to Pakistan .
The other side of this battered coin , as viewed from a similarly paranoid Islamabad , is that India , in newly - forged , post - Bush collusion with the US , seeks to encircle Pakistan by bolstering a friendly , pro - western Afghanistan .
While mindful of all that , Nawaz Sharif is under pressure to end the chronic extremist and sectarian violence that plagues Pakistan .
In the latest outrage , nine people died on Monday in a bomb attack on a Shia mosque in Peshawar .
Desperate to revive the failing domestic economy and ( like Karzai ) keen to demonstrate his independence from Washington , Nawaz has now proposed his own "" last chance "" peace talks , with Pakistan 's Tehreek - e - Taliban ( TTP ) .
But like an inexperienced suitor reaching clumsily for an embrace , Nawaz 's propositioning went wrong from the start .
His so - called peace plan was plucked out of the blue last week .
It is unclear who is representing who .
And there are no terms of reference and no timeframe .
Little wonder that on Monday key political figures such as Imran Khan washed their hands of the whole implausible business .
Analysts suspect Nawaz dreamt up the scheme to demonstrate to the public , and to the unpopular , drone - wielding Americans , that he is not a puppet performing Washington 's bidding .
The US has been pushing for a renewed Pakistani army offensive in the tribal areas , to coincide with the Nato drawdown and presidential elections across the border .
A more vengeful motive might be Nawaz 's determination to punish the former president , General Pervez Musharraf , who deposed him in a coup in 1999 .
Musharraf remains a darling of the army and Nawaz may wish the general 's current treason trial completed before ordering the military into uncertain conflict .
Whichever way you cut it , in either case – in Afghanistan and Pakistan – the Taliban seem to be winning .
And in the final analysis , this is surely not simply the fault of Karzai or Nawaz .
When Obama pre - empted all future debate by fixing on December 2014 as the date for Nato 's exit he in effect invited the Taliban to sit out the clock .
This they are now doing with great aplomb , in grateful expectation that all they wish for will soon be theirs ."
2014-02-06,"It is hard sometimes to describe the enormous efforts taken by the Afghan political elite and conservative lawmakers to roll back hard won progress on women 's rights in Afghanistan .
Here we have yet another frightening example : a new law , passed by both houses of the Afghan parliament and waiting for President Hamid Karzai 's ratification , would prohibit the questioning of relatives of an accused perpetrator of a crime , effectively eliminating victim testimony in cases of domestic violence .
In article 26 of the proposed change in the criminal prosecution code , those prohibited from testifying would include : husbands , wives , mothers , fathers , brothers , sisters , uncles , aunts and descendants of those relatives up to the second generation .
Doctors and psychiatrists would also be banned from giving evidence .
This proposed law is particularly troubling in a country where violence against women is endemic and , most commonly , is at the hands of a relative .
In a 2008 study , Global Rights found that 87 % of Afghan women will experience some form of violence in their lifetime ; 62 % experience multiple forms of violence , including forced marriage and sexual violence .
Women for Afghan Women ( WAW ) can attest to these findings .
Over 90 % of the nearly 10,000 women and girls we have served since 2007 have been victims of domestic violence .
Our clients have been raped , sold , beaten , starved and mutilated – primarily at the hands of a family member , or in some cases , multiple family members .
Should Karzai sign this law into effect , justice for these women would be virtually impossible .
Not only would they be barred from testifying against family members who committed crimes against them , any family member who witnessed the crime would be barred as well .
Under the proposals , WAW clients , such as 15-year - old Sahar Gul who was kept in a basement and tortured by her in - laws , would have been robbed , not only of justice , but of the opportunity to reclaim her power and testify against her tormentors .
Furthermore , the doctors who treated her bloodied , malnourished , and burned body would also be barred from testifying .
Sahar Gul 's in - laws are serving a five - year prison sentence for torturing her .
Had the new measure been law in 2012 , her in - laws would likely be free to torture and abuse more women .
Other clients , such as 16-year - old Naziba who was raped by her father , would be left with no other option but to live with the abuse .
At Naziba 's rape trial , her mother and uncles courageously testified against her father , and he is now serving a 12-year prison sentence .
If Naziba 's relatives had been barred from testifying on her behalf , Naziba 's father might still be raping her today .
The timing of this proposed change to the law is important : a recent report by UN Women found that reported cases of violence against women was up 28 % in the past year .
This finding is significant because it illustrates that Afghan women are beginning to understand their rights and demand access to them .
Since 2007 , our organisation has worked hard to build coalitions with local police departments , government ministries and court officials .
As a result of our advocacy , these agencies are referring more and more victims to our services , instead of sending them back home or imprisoning them for running away .
In some provinces , such as Kabul , the police are our biggest ally – they refer more women than any other agency .
This gives us hope , illustrating that there has been a shift in attitude and perception about violence against women , not only among Afghan women , but at an institutional level as well .
However , should Karzai ratify this law , I fear that women would stop coming forward because prosecutions would be nearly impossible to secure .
As an organisation that has been working tirelessly to obtain justice for women and girls who have suffered so much and so needlessly , our hands would be tied .
There would be little we could do .
We , along with other human rights activists , refuse to stand back and allow this to happen .
The stakes are too high and the consequences too horrific to imagine ."
2014-02-10,"The European Union has called a draft Afghan law that would silence battered women a "" backward step "" , while activists warn there are only two weeks to stop it coming into force .
The new criminal prosecution code bars relatives from testifying against each other , in effect putting justice out of reach for victims of domestic violence , forced marriage or child abuse .
A final draft was completed last week and has been sent by parliament to President Hamid Karzai , according to an international diplomat who is following the progress of the legislation .
Under the Afghan constitution , if Karzai does not veto it within 15 days , the law will come into force by default .
The president 's office did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment on his position .
"" I am very concerned that this new law would restrict prosecutions for domestic violence and child abuse in Afghanistan , "" the EU 's foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , said .
"" This would be a serious backward step in the justified and legitimate struggle for the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan .
I urge the Afghan government to amend the language of article 26 of the criminal procedure code to avoid any misinterpretation , clarify their commitment to human rights and ensure consistency with international standards .
"" There has been a flurry of lobbying by diplomats since news of the draft and its implications broke last week .
Much of it has been behind the scenes , with embassies saying they are wary of giving ammunition to conservatives in government , who argue that women 's rights are a western imposition on Afghan culture .
But the Canadian government has also spoken out about the law , with the minister of state for foreign affairs , Lynne Yelich , telling Kabul that she was deeply concerned about its wider impact . ""
This law would further limit protections for those who need it most , make it harder to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions and deny victims access to justice , "" she said .
Afghan activists , who have described the law as "" a travesty "" , have stepped up pressure on Karzai to block or change it .
They hope to repeat the success of a campaign in 2009 that forced the president to soften a family law enshrining marital rape as a husband 's right .
But that was five years ago , and since then Karzai has presided over a strengthening of conservative forces .
In the past year alone , parliament has blocked a law to curb violence against women and cut the quota for women on provincial councils , while the justice ministry floated a proposal to bring back stoning as a punishment for adultery .
Legal experts warned that , although news coverage has focused on how the law would affect women , in part because one of its backers is a vocal opponent of women 's rights , it also has other alarming implications .
The brief sub - section of article 26 could be devastating to efforts to prosecute narcotics gangs , and if it comes into force would undermine the security forces and legal system , according to Kimberley Motley , a lawyer with a practice in Kabul .
"" The law is not just [ about ] in - court testimony , but it says that witnesses can not even be questioned , which takes a lot of authority away from the Afghan police , Afghan army , NDS [ intelligence agency ] , and the attorney general 's office , "" said Motley .
Her work has included representing some of the most high - profile abused women , including the tortured child bride Sahar Gul , but also a range of other cases .
"" It is a real mistake to just focus on how this law affects women , "" she said .
"" This law has the potential to make Afghanistan an absolute abysmal catastrophe as it relates to public order , rule of law and general common decency . """
2014-02-11,"The US is likely to fail in its efforts to persuade Afghan president Hamid Karzai to agree to a long - term American troop presence in his country , according to director of national intelligence James Clapper .
In the most senior warning yet of Washington ’s growing rift with Kabul , Clapper told the Senate armed services committee that he did not believe that Karzai would sign the proposed bilateral security agreement .
The White House insists that the BSA is necessary for it to retain any security presence in Afghanistan after the bulk of American troops withdraw later this year , but has continued to say it is hopeful that Karzai would eventually sign .
“
My own view – and it ’s not the company view – is that I do n’t think Karzai is going to sign it , ” Clapper told the committee on Wednesday .
Obama ’s intelligence chief also said a formal US decision to wait for Karzai ’s successor to sign the agreement instead could “ have a salutary ” effect on Kabul .
The stalemate over the BSA , which was provisionally approved by a loya jirga of tribal leaders last year , has already lowered economic growth and driven away foreign investors according to Clapper .
“
The effect already of the delay has been negative in terms of impact on the economy , ” he said ."
2014-02-13,"Relations between Washington and Kabul took another turn for the worse on Thursday as Afghan president Hamid Karzai criticised a lack of US respect for its sovereignty and White House officials appeared increasingly resigned to gambling on a better rapport with his successor .
The two governments have been at loggerheads for several months over Karzai ’s refusal to sign an agreement governing a continued American security presence in the country after the bulk of Nato troops pull out later this year .
But growing irritation on both sides boiled over this week after US criticism of an Afghan decision to release 65 suspected Taliban prisoners , and officials in Washington have begun openly speculating on what would happen if Karzai never signs the agreement .
“
The longer the BSA goes unsigned by Karzai , it increases likelihood that there will be no troops after 2014 in Afghanistan , ” said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf in a conference call with reporters .
The threat to pull out entirely has been made before by the US , but the White House has previously insisted that Karzai sign it within weeks .
Instead , both Harf and White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to put a timeframe on the process during the latest press briefings and national intelligence director James Clapper said on Tuesday his personal view was that it would not be completed before the election .
“
It is the Afghan government that negotiated this agreement , ” said Carney on Wednesday .
“
There is the reality that this is –
we ’re now in February of 2014 and we ’re having to look at , with our Nato allies , what the world looks like in terms of our troops beyond 2014 .
And that ’s why it needs to be signed promptly if we ’re going to be able to fulfil our preferred approach here , which is to have a limited troop presence in order to continue to conduct [ counter - terrorism ] operations and to train and support the Afghan security forces .
”
But a shared interest in combating Taliban attacks is not enough to prevent a growing clash , particularly over prisoner releases .
“
Afghanistan is a sovereign country , ” said Karzai at a conference in Turkey on Thursday .
“ If the Afghan judicial authorities decide to release a prisoner it is of no concern to the US .
I hope that the US will stop harassing Afghanistan ’s procedures and judicial authority and I hope the US will now begin to respect Afghan sovereignty .
”
Karzai also insisted he still supports the principle of a bilateral security agreement , which was supported last year by a loya jirga of tribal leaders , but US officials are increasingly pinning their hopes on pressuring his successor instead after Karzai steps down for elections in April .
Speaking before the Senate armed services committee on Tuesday , Clapper said a formal US decision to wait for Karzai ’s successor to sign the agreement instead could “ have a salutary ” effect on Kabul ."
2014-02-13,"It feels like a slap in the face of humanity : a new Afghan draft law effectively legalising domestic violence against women and children .
If it were a movie this bill , which will automatically become law later this month unless President Hamid Karzai refuses to ratify it , would be called "" The Patriarch Returns "" .
So are we to take it that this is the price of peace ?
That Afghan parliamentarians are with this and other measures paving the way for the Taliban to be brought back into the fold , repealing progressive laws to accommodate their views on women ?
After 10 years of war , was it naive of the west to assume that Afghan women would be "" liberated "" if the Taliban were gone and the burqas thrown off ?
The truth is that a backlash against women rights campaigns started back in 2001 after the overthrow of the Taliban .
Its first public face was the young TV presenter Shaima Rezayee .
Accused of flirting on TV , the music show presenter was found shot dead in 2005 .
The murder was never fully investigated but rumours abounded that hers was a Taliban murder or maybe an "" honour killing "" .
That these two possibilities could be expressed in one breath showed that the misogyny of the average Afghan family was perhaps not vastly different from that of a Taliban state .
Shaima 's killing made it clear : if there was one part of Afghan society that was ready to embrace women 's rights , there was another part that was ready to suppress them .
Women soon discovered that the enemies of women 's rights were as omnipresent as dust , god and corruption .
Neologisms such as "" the Talib in suits "" or "" the tie - wearing Talib "" were coined to sum up encounters with misogynist men dressed up as progressives .
Some of them held PhDs .
Others were Fulbright scholars .
But a university degree was no guarantee for a progressive mind .
Meanwhile , the silence of the women whose very job it was to stand up for Afghan women against this steady backlash was conspicuous , but not surprising .
Many of them were mere extensions of the same mafia clans that had already infiltrated politics and economy .
Few of them believed in feminism .
Some publicly distanced themselves from women 's rights , but never in English .
Others openly supported the Taliban , but never in English .
To the local population , they were known either as crooks , or wives and sisters of crooks .
The international community , however , mostly remained blissfully unaware of all this .
Be that as it may , the idea that we could empower Afghan women by making them aware of their individual rights was preposterous and bound to fail from the inception .
Anyone who has spent even two days in Afghanistan knows that individualism as a concept does not exist there .
The idea that we could treat women as a separate entity , legal or political , and disconnected from their family was flawed from the start .
Those young women who embraced and internalised these values ended up fighting not only alone but also perpetually , and not only against the wider society but also often their own family .
Such struggles were bound to happen because the Afghan wars of recent decades have all been about sustaining the power of traditional society , a key part of which is patriarchy .
The bearded men who sit in parliament are the outward expression of the revival of a jealously guarded patriarchy where a man 's family is not only his personal fiefdom , but also a sovereign , state - free space .
That is why the Afghan - US bilateral security agreement , which would facilitate leaving 8,000 troops in Afghanistan at the end of this year when the main US military withdrawal takes place , hinged on this very question of whether American soldiers would be allowed to enter Afghan homes .
To an assembly of patriarchs , Karzai explained : "" The Americans say , what if a US soldier is kidnapped and held captive in an Afghan home ?
If we do n't have the right to enter Afghan homes , how are we supposed to free our soldier ?
That 's why the Americans want the right to enter Afghan homes . ""
When the patriarchs approved of the accord in November , I was not surprised .
After all , they knew that nothing could take place inside the private fiefdom of family territory , and that no US soldier could be kept there without the patriarch 's knowledge let alone consent .
They voted in favour of the US staying because they knew that the scenario was fictional .
That 's because the Taliban , too , failed and still fail to project their power on to the family sphere .
The only incidents of public uprising against the Taliban have been about the Taliban interfering in matters that are regarded as within the jurisdiction of the patriarchs of the extended family .
Afghanistan 's patriarchal clans have survived leftist coups and rightwing wars , becoming the only source of stability in a society constantly in turmoil .
To dismantle their power would amount to freedom not only for women but also men .
But to reach that end , we need more than the rhetoric of individual rights imported from the other side of the planet ."
2014-02-17,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has blocked a law that would silence victims of domestic violence , forced marriage and child abuse and demanded major revisions after a campaign by Afghan activists and western diplomats .
The legislation bans relatives from testifying against each other , and in a country where forensic evidence is relatively undeveloped , that would effectively halt prosecution in even the most vicious cases of violence against women , including those mutilated by their husbands or attacked by brothers and fathers .
The provision was inserted into a new criminal prosecution code , much needed and years in the making , at the last minute .
It was steered through parliament by a prominent opponent of women 's rights , and conservative MPs resisted efforts to moderate the strict controls .
They apparently also had backing from some sections of government ; early on Monday , a justice ministry official told the Guardian that western embassies had simply "" misunderstood "" the law , and that he expected the confusion be be resolved soon and without any changes needed .
But just a few hours later , a cabinet meeting chaired by Karzai ordered alterations to the brief section of the law causing the problems , his spokeswoman Adela Raz said .
"" At the meeting , His Excellency the President , and the cabinet , decided that article 26 needs to be amended . ""
She declined to say how the law would be altered , but the public repudiation of what would have been a devastating step backwards for Afghan women was welcomed by activists and diplomats .
They had mounted a vigorous lobbying campaign , both in public and behind the scenes , since the legislation first came to light earlier this month . ""
Who says advocacy and lobbying does not work ?
It does and we have seen results ! ""
campaigner Samira Hamidi said , celebrating on Twitter .
The European Union welcomed Karzai 's decision to "" stop [ a ] setback for women 's rights "" .
The United States , which had previously issued only a brief statement of concern about the law , welcomed Karzai 's decision as a "" response to the concerns expressed by many Afghans and their international partners "" .
Five years ago , after a similar campaign against a family law that appeared to allow marital rape , the Afghan president ripped up the legislation and shepherded a more moderate version through the houses of parliament .
Raz denied that the president , currently at odds with the US over issues from the election to the long - term presence of foreign troops , had been slow to respond to the latest law in response to foreign or domestic pressure .
The draft had been held up by bureaucracy , and Karzai demanded changes as soon as it reached his desk , she said .
"" As soon as it arrived , it was brought to the cabinet as any law would be for discussion , and like anyone else who is concerned about women 's rights , they responded , "" she said , adding that Karzai had a track record of supporting women . ""
In the past you have seen that the president is someone who has made sure women 's rights are protected according to the laws of the country . ""
Whatever his personal views , Karzai has presided over a strengthening of factions opposed to women 's rights during his latest term in office .
In the last year alone parliament has blocked a law to curb violence against women and cut the quota for women on provincial councils , while the justice ministry has floated a proposal to bring back stoning as a punishment for adultery .
Activists also say the change to the law as currently planned would still leave women more vulnerable than they are now .
It allows relatives to testify against each other if they wish but does not grant any legal rights to call them to the stand .
An amended draft in circulation now says that relatives of the accused have a right "" not to answer questions "" , according to an international diplomat following the case .
Protections in most countries exempt only husbands and wives from a legal obligation to testify against each other , while the new Afghan law covers a very wide range of relatives , from a mother 's great - uncle to a brother 's grandchildren .
Especially in close - knit villages , this could potentially allow dozens of key witnesses to avoid giving evidence .
"" We are cautiously optimistic after hearing statements from the palace , "" said Heather Barr , Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch , which first raised concerns about the law .
"" We need to see the exact language before we can know whether it will really fix the problem . ""
President Karzai 's decision today is an indication that this kind of international reaction still makes a difference , and we would beg diplomats not to sit by next time there is an attack on women 's rights , because there will be one , "" she added .
However , along with the demands to protect modest gains in women 's rights since the fall of the Taliban , there is also some pressure for a fast resolution of the current standoff , because Afghanistan is in desperate need of a new criminal prosecution code ."
2014-02-23,"The Taliban killed 21 Afghan soldiers on Sunday at a remote outpost near the border with Pakistan , and took at least five others prisoner , in a show of military strength just weeks before a critical election .
The night raid was one of the deadliest single attacks in recent years on the Afghan military , who are stronger and more disciplined than the police and less often targeted directly by insurgents .
President Hamid Karzai cancelled a planned trip to Sri Lanka to deal with the fallout from the deaths , and in a swipe at his neighbour condemned Islamabad for tolerating havens for the insurgents just inside its border .
The fighting came less than two months before a presidential election that , if it goes ahead smoothly , would give Afghanistan a first peaceful and democratic transfer of power .
The Taliban have denounced it as a "" waste of time "" and have begun attacks on candidates and election workers , but the government says the increasingly confident security forces will be able to secure voters and polling stations even in areas on the fringe of Taliban strongholds .
Candidates rushed to condemn the killings and Karzai 's ally Zalmay Rassoul paid tribute to the "" bravery and sacrifices "" of the police , army and intelligence services .
Yesterday 's attack began in the morning when dozens of militants , some of them foreigners , converged on an army checkpoint in the mountainous Kunar province , Afghan officials said .
The insurgents outnumbered the government troops and were also possibly helped by a Taliban sympathiser inside the base , officials said .
The scale of the onslaught gave most of the soldiers little chance and several were shot in their sleep , a source said .
Fighting to recapture the base continued into afternoon ; reinforcements sent to the area were ambushed by a suicide bomber but none of them were killed , the defence ministry said .
Officials said the bodies of the 21 soldiers would be returned to their families on Monday , and the search would continue for those believed to be held captive .
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in a text message , saying that only one insurgent had been killed and two others injured .
The militants had collected weapons abandoned by the troops a spokesman , Zabihullah Mujahid , said .
The deaths came shortly after the Taliban announced they were suspending talks with the US over the return of the country 's only prisoner of war , Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl , who went missing near the border more than four years ago .
In a brief statement , the group said only that they had suspended talks because of "" the political complexity of the current situation in the country "" .
A week ago , the Pakistani Taliban , who are linked to the Afghan group but focused more on fighting in their own country , killed 23 of Pakistan 's Frontier Corps paramilitary soldiers they had captured .
Islamabad said the men were on Afghan soil when they died and protested to the Afghan government , which denied the killings took place inside their borders .
Mokhtar Amiri contributed to the report ."
2014-02-24,"Nato defence ministers will meet this week to discuss its future military presence in Afghanistan as Barack Obama weighs whether to order the Pentagon to begin preparations for a total withdrawal of all US forces at the end of this year .
The crunch meeting in Brussels on Wednesday comes amid growing acceptance in Washington that Afghan president Hamid Karzai is unlikely to sign a bilateral security agreement ( BSA ) finalised last November for a residual US security force to remain after the bulk of its troops pull out in 2014 .
Afghanistan has elections scheduled for April to choose a successor to Karzai , who as incumbent can not stand again .
But a complicated two - round voting system means there is little expectation a new leader will be in office before the end of the summer .
Instead , the US is increasingly focused on making a deal with whoever succeeds him .
All of the top contenders have backed the BSA , but by the time the winner comes into office , Nato may only have a few months to plan its 2015 deployment .
Although the last troops could still be withdrawn relatively quickly if needed , the political impasse threatens to frustrate the complex process of scaling down the Nato presence – particularly for allies that depend on the US for logistical support .
As a result , the White House has been considering whether to order to its military commanders to include the so - called “ zero option ” in its planning scenarios , according to a senior official speaking on background .
Though symbolic to the extent that Pentagon planners have long looked at a range of possible options for troop numbers , the formal order to plan for a full withdrawal would mark a significant escalation in the US war of words with Karzai .
Administration officials say that as of the middle of last week , president Obama had yet to make a final determination on the order but is keen to demonstrate that he is not bluffing when he says the US would pull out entirely if the BSA is not signed .
Military officials , who have worked through months of uncertainty over the future US role in Afghanistan , agree that the forthcoming Nato meeting represents a key moment in the tussle with Karzai .
“
Without question , the issues surrounding the future of the Afghan mission will certainly be discussed in Brussels , to include the challenges of retrograde and force posture faced by all Allies , ” said John Kirby , the Pentagon press secretary .
“
We long said that we would like a BSA as soon as possible .
Absent that , we would have to start planning to withdraw all our forces by the end of the year , ” Kirby added .
“ I ’m not going to put any timelines on that .
We ’d like a BSA as soon as possible .
”
The prospect of the US retreating entirely from Afghanistan without being able to guarantee a continued counter - terrorism role would carry significant risks for the White House , which is conscious that the US has spent 13 years and 2,000 soldiers have died trying to stabilise the country .
However , it believes that US public opinion is supportive of the withdrawal process and would be sympathetic to arguments that a continued presence is not wanted by the Afghans .
Security setbacks in Iraq following a similar failure to agree a US presence there have led to relatively little domestic criticism , despite the recent symbolic loss to insurgents of Fallujah .
The White House acknowledges it would be more difficult to carry out successful counter - terrorism operations against international militants along the lawless border with Pakistan if they do not have some troop presence on the ground , but privately argues such a role is not impossible – even without drone bases in the country .
In Afghanistan , Karzai ’s about - turn on the BSA late last year took most of the country , including portions of his own cabinet , by surprise .
The president ’s national security adviser Rangin Dadfar Spanta had already warned parliament that if the deal was not signed , the country would be left to the wolves – a warning about Afghanistan ’s fate in a region of wealthier and more populous neighbours keen to to have a say on policy in Kabul .
Most senior Afghans have not forgotten the fate of the last government backed by a global superpower .
Despite forecasts of rapid collapse after Soviet troops left in 1989 , President Mohammad Najibullah held off mujahidden fighters until 1992 .
But when the disintegration of the Soviet Union ended funding for the military , the government fell within weeks .
So worries in Kabul are not so much about the troops that the US may or may not leave behind .
Without their training and support the Afghan army will probably be less professional , and certainly struggle in critical areas from intelligence gathering to air power , but would probably still be able to hold off the Taliban .
The concern is about the money that the soldiers , and the drone bases they would support , bring with them .
Few in Kabul think the west – and particularly Washington – would be willing to provide a promised $ 8bn a year in military and development spending if they have been effectively booted out by the Afghan government .
“
Without the troops , there is no money , ” said one diplomat .
The leading presidential candidates have all backed the strategic pact , with the 2009 runner - up Abdullah Abdullah slamming Karzai for feeding isolationist sentiment in the US .
His main rivals have openly said they would sign the deal .
Zalmai Rassoul , a former foreign minister believed to have Hamid Karzai ’s blessing , has described it as “ good for Afghanistan ” and promised a signature if he wins .
Former finance minister and World Bank technocrat Ashraf Ghani helped hammer out the pact and described it as “ the source of Afghanistan ’s national sovereignty ” , underlining that it gives only the Afghan state the right to use force .
But after years of aborted ultimatums on issues from night raids on homes to control of prisoners – all areas where the US has ultimately bowed to Karzai ’s demands – American deadlines have limited credibility in Kabul .
There are fears among those familiar with the climate in Washington that Afghan officials are underestimating the extent of American disengagement from the war .
“
We do n’t believe there is a zero option , ” Karzai ’s spokesman told journalists last year after the president ’s surprise retreat from the long - term strategic partnership .
Although that infuriated many in Washington , the decision of top officials there to set Karzai a deadline for a decision on the BSA , only to back away from it when it passed unheeded , strengthened the belief of the Afghan leaders’ inner circle that the US was ultimately committed to keeping troops in Afghanistan regardless of the political and financial cost ."
2014-02-25,"Barack Obama formally ordered the Pentagon on Tuesday to make plans for a full pullout of American troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year , pointing to a way out of the conflict that is reminiscent of his end to the Iraq campaign .
While the Obama administration reiterated that it would prefer to maintain a residual military presence in Afghanistan , the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has refused to sign an accord that would pave the way for some US forces to remain .
That has forced the administration to begin a contingency plan for a full departure after Nato formally ends hostilities in November .
A similar rebuke from the Iraqi government prompted all almost all US troops to leave there in 2011 .
Obama told Karzai during a Tuesday morning phone call that while he would prefer Karzai or his successor to sign the so - called bilateral security agreement reached with the Afghans in November , “ the United States is moving forward with additional contingency planning , ” according to a White House description of the call .
But defense secretary Chuck Hagel said Tuesday that it was prudent “ to ensure adequate plans are in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014 ” .
Hagel said that over the next several months , the US military will prepare “ various options ” for US and Nato leaders , including a full withdrawal of the approximately 37,000 US troops in Afghanistan , as well as the post-2014 missions of counter - terrorism and training for the Afghan security forces it has long desired .
The White House confirmed that Obama ’s phone call to Karzai had been triggered in part by an urgent need to give clarity to Nato allies about any future US presence in Afghanistan .
“
One of the reasons for the call is because Secretary Hagel will be participating in the Nato defence ministerial later this week and planning for post 2014 forces will be on the agenda , ” said spokesman Jay Carney .
However , White House officials played down calls from Congress to cut off aid to Afghanistan if US troops are not allowed to stay , a major fear of politicians in Kabul .
“
We have made clear that our commitment to Afghanistan – separate from the troop presence – is in our national security interests , ” said Carney when asked about aid .
The White House rejected criticism that Obama had allowed a dangerous lack of communication with Karzai to develop .
Prior to today ’s call , the two leaders had barely spoken in months .
“
It is preposterous to suggest [ that Karzai ’s refusal to sign the BSA ] is because we have not made clear that it is to be signed , ” said Carney .
The White House also warned that even if the security agreement was signed imminently , the size of the US commitment may now be in doubt .
“
We remain open to the possibility of a post-2014 presence and the BSA being signed later this year , but the longer we go without it , the more the likelihood is that we will be smaller both in scale and ambition ,
” added Carney .
Since November , the Pentagon has urged Karzai to sign the deal , but has stopped short of formally preparing for what is known as the “ zero option , ” or full withdrawal .
Relations between the Afghan government and the US military have been strained over the past several weeks .
Earlier this month , the Kabul - based military command , under marine general Joseph Dunford , sharply rebuked its erstwhile Afghanistan partners for releasing 65 detainees it said had US and Afghan blood on their hands .
Dunford is said to favor a residual force in Afghanistan of around 10,000 troops , fearing that a full US departure after December will leave Afghanistan vulnerable to a reinvigorated push from the Taliban insurgents the US and its allies have failed to subdue after 12 years of war .
Dunford will testify before the Senate armed services committee about US plans for Afghanistan on 12 March , the committee announced Tuesday .
Administration officials told the Guardian that they expected to discuss a future presence or full withdrawal from Afghanistan in Brussels at a Nato summit of defense ministers later this week .
Preparations for a withdrawal from Afghanistan are complicated by the fact that the use of air bases there are not solely focused on waging war .
Bases like Kandahar in the south and Jalalabad in the east are also platforms for flying surveillance and armed drones into neighboring Pakistan , and surveillance drones have also likely flown from Kandahar into Iran .
Losing access to Afghan air bases may likely prompt the US to look for alternative regional launchpads in central Asian states , an uncertain prospect complicated by their dismal human rights records .
In 2005 , Uzbekistan revoked US access to its Karshi - Khanabad air base following a diplomatic row over a bloody crackdown that May in Andijan province .
The Pentagon did not comment on any airbase negotiations , but a spokeswoman , Navy commander Elissa Smith , said “ regardless of the outcome of the BSA , the United States will take the steps necessary to combat terrorism and protect our interests ” .
On Tuesday afternoon , Hagel was scheduled to meet at the White House with secretary of state John Kerry and Susan Rice , Obama ’s national security adviser .
Should an elected successor to Karzai also decline to sign the bilateral accord , it would mark the second time in three years that the host government of a bloody , protracted US military campaign rebuked its Washington sponsor .
In 2011 , the Iraqi government refused to allow Obama to maintain a residual presence in Iraq – a decision Obama used to campaign for reelection on a tide of ending US wars , and which has come under harsh scrutiny after forces loyal to al - Qaida proclaimed themselves in control of parts of Anbar province last month .
Claude Chafin , a spokesman for House Armed Services Committee chairman Buck McKeon , a California Republican , accused the White House of wanting the Afghans to force the US out .
“
Certainly Chairman McKeon is disappointed that negotiations seem to have broken down .
He wonders if BSA talks would have played out differently had the president committed to maintaining public support for his strategy .
If the American people were aware of our achievements in Afghanistan , if they were aware of how far the ANSF [ Afghan National Security Forces ] had come , would they be more willing to side with our Afghan allies and wait Karzai out ?
, ” Chafin said .
“ That is , in any case , what the president should do .
A residual force post-2014 is in our national security interest and that of our Afghan allies .
The Afghan people want us to stay , and the leading Afghan Presidential candidates support the BSA .
There is little point in diplomatic brinkmanship with Karzai , he is quickly becoming irrelevant to the process .
Such rhetoric only furthers the narrative that we suspect the White House wants to build : like Iraq , we were willing to stay , but we could n’t reach an agreement .
No one wants Afghanistan to end like Iraq – because the consequences for future US security and interests can be dire .
”"
2014-03-07,"President Hamid Karzai 's government has let down Afghan women , according to the new EU ambassador to Kabul , who singled out the failure to end prosecution of rape victims and other abused women for "" moral crimes "" as a particular "" disgrace "" .
Franz - Michael Mellbin said that despite huge practical improvements in areas from maternal mortality to the number of girls in schools , Afghanistan was still one of the worst places to be a woman and a frontline in the global battle for women 's rights .
Mellbin , who previously served in Afghanistan as the Danish envoy , declined to criticise Karzai directly but said the government overall had failed in its responsibilities to be a voice for women 's rights , as conservatives opposed to women having any role outside the home gathered strength .
"" We can not be satisfied with what has been done .
Right now what I feel is unfortunately very much lacking is that the government is not showing a sense of priority and urgency that we 'd like to see , "" he told the Guardian in an interview to mark International Women 's Day . ""
What we are lacking is a strong official voice to counter those reactionary voices … this makes it very difficult to fight for progress .
We look in vain for strong government policy . ""
Karzai has always described himself as a supporter of women 's rights , but recently there has been heavy pressure on the fragile gains made after the Taliban 's fall from power .
Last year a landmark law to prevent violence against women was pushed out of parliament , the quota of seats for women on provincial councils was cut , and a proposal to reintroduce stoning as a punishment for adultery – used more against women than men – put forward by the justice ministry .
Earlier this year , parliament passed a law that gagged victims of domestic violence by preventing relatives testifying against each other , although it was later modified on Karzai 's orders .
Many women believe this is happening because political interest in Afghanistan is fading in the west as troops head home .
They fear that with the complete departure of foreign forces this year , conservatives will chip away faster at their rights or simply use them as a bargaining chip in peace talks with the Taliban .
"" I understand why Afghan women are very worried about the future , and they are , they constantly raise this issue with me , "" Mellbin said , adding that he was inspired by Afghan women 's determination to seize every opportunity made available to them .
"" All over Afghanistan women today are ' first movers ' .
Some will be the first woman in their family to go to school , others to open a business or take public office .
There is a tremendous awareness among Afghan women that they are trail - blazing for the next generation , for their daughters . ""
He plans to make women 's rights a priority during his time in Kabul , as part of the EU 's "" value - driven foreign policy "" , at least until he sees a government more focused on protecting and expanding gains so far .
"" I do not subscribe to the view that silence is an option , "" Mellbin said .
"" We need to be more ambitious .
Our agenda has to be continued progress , continued advancement .
"" The ambassador said the campaign for the presidential election on 5 April was encouraging , with all the leading candidates to replace Karzai , who can not stand again , pitching themselves as modernising nationalists .
"" We 're trying to prepare a list of issues that we would like to raise with the new government with regard to women 's rights as soon as it comes into power , "" he said .
He plans to push for an end to the trial of women for "" moral crimes "" , which are mostly violations of social norms , such as running away from a forced or abusive marriage .
Rape victims have also been jailed for having sex outside marriage . ""
[ The prosecution of ] moral crimes is something that is a scourge for women in Afghanistan , it means that girls and women who are victims … are further victimised by the state , "" he said .
"" Its a disgrace for any country to have such an institution . ""
Activists are likely to welcome Mellbin 's stance , after strong criticism of western nations that fund the Afghan government but have often seemed unwilling to speak out on women 's rights . ""
Over the past year , through an escalating series of serious attacks on women 's rights , the response from donors has largely been a deafening silence , "" said Heather Barr , Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch .
"" No government as dependent on foreign aid as this one has the luxury of not caring what donors think .
Donors need to speak out quickly and forcefully every time there is an attack on women 's rights .
When they fail to do so it just makes it look like they do n't care . """
2014-03-12,"The commander of the US - Nato war in Afghanistan said Wednesday that a full troop withdrawal in December would prompt a rapid deterioration of gains made in the 13-year conflict .
“
The only debate is the pace of that deterioration , ” Marine General Joseph Dunford testified to the Senate armed services committee in comments that implicitly defied the White House .
In February , President Obama instructed the Pentagon to begin preparing for a total withdrawal of the approximately 33,000 US troops in Afghanistan after his Afghan counterpart , Hamid Karzai , refused to sign a long - term basing deal .
Dunford told the committee that he favors a post-2014 presence of between 8,000 and 12,000 Nato troops , the majority of them Americans , to continue mentoring Afghan forces , augmented by a few thousand US special operations forces for counterterrorism missions .
Al - Qaida is “ in survival mode ” in Afghanistan , Dunford told the panel , although for at least five years the US military has estimated the al - Qaeda presence in the country at fewer than 100 people .
With Afghan presidential elections slated to begin April 5 , the US and Nato have not have much time to orchestrate a troop deal with the victor – a window that grows smaller if there is a runoff election .
Dunford told lawmakers that by July and August “ manageable risk ” will accrue to US military planning for either a total withdrawal or a significant drawdown .
“
The risk of an orderly withdrawal begins to be high in September , ” Dunford said .
But Dunford later told the Senate that if the Afghan presidential election goes into a runoff , as happened in 2009 despite widespread fraud from Karzai , he assesses that a successor president would not enter office until August , presenting the US with a small diplomatic margin of error for finalizing a deal for a residual Afghanistan force .
The White House and Pentagon have repeatedly stated they would prefer a residual presence , portraying last month ’s planning decision as a merely prudential one .
But the commander made it clear he considered full withdrawal to be a portent of disaster .
“ Withdrawal , in my mind , means abandoning the people of Afghanistan , abandoning the endeavor we ’ve been on for the last decade , and providing al - Qaida the space within which to plan and conduct operations against the west , ” Dunford said .
Dunford clashed with Senator Joe Manchin , a West Virginia Democrat , who argued that Dunford was proposing an open - ended war that Manchin could not justify to his constituents .
“
We ’re a very hawkish state , we like a good fight
…
this one makes no sense to any West Virginian at all , ” Manchin said .
“
Senator , I would assess that if we do n’t stay there , continue the job of growing the Afghan forces , so they can replace us in providing security in Afghanistan , we ’ll actually have a good fight , ” Dunford replied ."
2014-03-24,"The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has backed Russia 's annexation of Crimea , saying a much - criticised referendum on its future reflected its people 's "" free will "" to decide their future .
That stance , announced at a meeting with a US congressional delegation , puts Afghanistan in company with Venezuela , Syria and a few other nations .
It was an unexpected move from a man who has little stake in Ukraine 's future , spent years fighting to evict Soviet forces from his own country , and now leads a democracy funded largely by the western nations that have slapped sanctions on Moscow .
However , Karzai has always been keen to counter accusations that he is a foreign puppet , and more recently has been at odds with the United States over everything from air strikes and the forthcoming presidential election to the recent release of dozens of prisoners captured by foreign troops .
He may also be looking to strengthen regional ties , at a time when western interest in Afghanistan is fading and with it the funds the government needs to pay the army and keep the country running .
"" The two sides discussed issues of regional importance , in particular the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol to the Russian Federation , "" an account of the meeting issued by Karzai 's office said .
"" The president said that Afghanistan respects the free will of the people of Crimea to decide about their own future , "" the statement added , without giving further details .
Karzai travelled to Sochi for the recent Winter Olympics when many European heads of state boycotted the ceremony , and Russia is starting to put money back into Afghanistan as foreign troops leave , retooling a factory that builds prefabricated housing and opening a cultural centre among other projects ."
2014-03-28,"Afghan election organisers have warned president Hamid Karzai that government employees have thrown state resources behind one of the main candidates vying to replace him , a senior official said .
The president should fire the man responsible , who was backing the former foreign minister Zalmai Rassoul , or risk sending voters the message that Karzai is also taking sides in next week 's vote , said Independent Election Commission chairman Yusuf Nuristani .
"" Some government officials are working for some candidates .
The law says that a civil servant should not campaign for a candidate , should not use public resources , government time , government vehicles , "" Nuristani said in an interview in his heavily fortified Kabul headquarters .
"" We heard one guy in Paktia province was putting up pictures of Zalmai Rassoul on major highways ... and I wrote to the President , [ requesting ] that the guy who is doing these things should be immediately dismissed from his job . ""
Nuristani declined to confirm which official had been involved in wrongdoing but a spokesman for the provincial governor Juma Khan Hamdard said it was his boss . ""
This accusation was about the governor , "" said Ruhullah Samoon .
"" There is no evidence to back it up .
The governor rejected it at a press conference and I am saying that again , it is not true . ""
Rassoul 's campaign declined to comment directly on the complaint , saying that it would be handled by authorities .
"" This is a matter that concerns the government and the independent election commission ( IEC ) .
We respect the authority and independence of the IEC and the election complaint commission , "" said spokesman Javid Faisal .
"" Our campaign has immense and timely momentum and we hope the election will be transparent , free and fair . ""
Widespread fraud in the 2009 presidential election that returned Karzai to office for a second term left both Afghans and the country 's international backers disillusioned with the voting process .
Organisers have a raft of new measures to try and limit cheating in this year 's historic poll , which if it goes off smoothly will mark the country 's first ever peaceful , democratic transition of power .
Karzai himself has repeatedly said his only role in determining the next leader will be the single ballot he gets to cast , like all other Afghan citizens , and he has refrained from backing any of the eight remaining candidates in public .
In private though he is widely believed to favour Rassoul , after he persuaded his brother Qayum Karzai to drop his own campaign for the top job and support the former foreign minister instead .
Nuristani said that the president 's response to his complaint would be an important test of his pledge of public independence .
""
Its up to the president to decide to take action
, that is what he has promised the people , that he will remain neutral , that he will not interfere in the [ election ] commission 's work and he requested all the other government employees to stay away from siding with one candidate or another , "" Nuristani said .
"" We expect the president to implement his promises , otherwise this will show that he is personally siding with someone . ""
Karzai personally told election organisers to bring to his attention any abuse of government resources and promised swift and appropriate punishment , the president 's spokesman said but Nuristani had provided neither names nor evidence .
"" This complaint was sent to the palace and we can confirm that we received it , it is talking about provincial officials in Paktia , but does n't name any individuals and there is no evidence within the letter , "" Aimal Faizi told the Guardian . ""
[ The IEC ] should openly raise their voice as the responsible commission and name the officials who violate the law and interfere in the election process , "" he said , adding that the president 's office would seek more details .
"" If there are names , with evidence , the president is ready to take action . ""
The election has turned out to be an unexpectedly tight race and there have been reports of dirty tricks from all sides ; the major campaign teams are keeping a close eye on their rivals and have all filed a flurry of complaints with poll watchdog the Independent Election Complaints Commission ( IECC ) .
A photograph circulating on social media purporting to show border police handing out posters for Rassoul at a checkpoint turned out on closer inspection to be a doctored version of a 2012 Nato publicity picture .
Campaign organisers went on national television with both images to denounce the unscrupulous Photoshopping .
So far the only punishment handed down has been to Ashraf Ghani who was fined 50,000 Afghanis ( $ 1000 ) for the use of armoured government cars he held onto after stepping down from his last official post .
If the president does not take action on the reported violation , Nuristani said , the official could potentially be referred to prosecutors by the electoral complaints commission but he has no influence over the poll watchdog .
Civil society organisation the Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan said any allegations of abuse should be handled by the official complaints commission ."
2014-04-01,"A stone 's throw from the palace where President Hamid Karzai has spent 13 years , a newly renovated home awaits him and his family .
Karzai is due to step down after Saturday 's presidential election .
Under the constitution he can not stand again , so the vote is setting the stage for Afghanistan 's first ever peaceful , democratic transfer of power .
Simply by leaving his job voluntarily , something no other leader of the country has done , Karzai will be creating an important legacy for himself , diplomats and senior Afghan officials say .
"" The more important part of Karzai 's legacy will be the successful achievement of a political transfer of authority to a new president , "" said the US ambassador to Afghanistan , James Cunningham , adding that it will be both an achievement and indicator of the country 's future .
But Karzai 's new home is a reminder that after 13 years at the helm , his influence is unlikely to end when he leaves office .
The 56-year - old insists that after he hands over the reins , he wants a break .
He has had barely a day away from his job since he came to power , and little time to spend with his wife and three young children . ""
If God gives me a life to go around , visit the country and enjoy myself and go to cafes , visit London during Christmas , and see the lights , visit places , work on Afghan education and be with the Afghan people , "" he said recently .
But few people expect a man who has so skilfully juggled competing factions , and outmanoeuvred his foreign financial and military backers , to slip into a simple retirement with his family .
Karzai will be relatively young for a former leader , and admits he would like a political role if his successor permits it .
His new home would allow him to reach the seat of power in minutes ; its garden backs on to the palace grounds .
"" The president will be a happy citizen of the country , and if asked by the next president to advise him on issues , he will be happy to advise , "" said spokesman Aimal Faizi , who added that Karzai had turned down tempting job offers overseas .
"" He will be in the country and in the service of the people . ""
The three frontrunners for the top job , all of whom served as ministers under Karzai , have at least civil relationships with him and are unlikely to exile him completely .
While his lingering power may be a threat , he could also be extremely useful to the new ruler as a powerful orator and master of alliances adept at balancing the country 's ethnic and regional needs .
Karzai is believed to favour Zalmai Rassoul , a former foreign minister who emerged from relative obscurity to run for the top office and has the backing of Karzai 's brothers Qayum and Mahmoud .
Rassoul denies Karzai would be the power behind the throne , but said if he won , he would try to tempt his predecessor back into public life . ""
He will play a role , he 's a young man who has played a key role in Afghan history and still has a lot of support , "" Rassoul said in an interview on his campaign plane .
"" It depends on him , and when I talk to him about it he says he wants some rest . """
2014-04-01,"There are still days to go and no one has cast a ballot yet .
But leading candidates in Afghanistan 's presidential election are warning that fraud will play a big role in the vote , raising fears of bitter antagonism following Saturday 's crucial poll .
Abdullah Abdullah , one of the frontrunners in the race to replace Hamid Karzai as Afghan president , has reiterated his concerns about "" industrial - scale fraud "" in the vote .
His rival , the former finance minister Ashraf Ghani , recently told the Guardian his team was trying to pre - empt the kind of fraud that riddled the 2009 voting , adding : "" People will not be deprived of their right to good governance . ""
Large - scale cheating has marred every Afghan election since the Taliban 's fall .
Prospects of a repeat performance have loomed over the 5 April poll long before the candidates launched their campaigns .
Only a quarter of Afghans expect the vote to be clean , a recent survey by the Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan ( Fefa ) found .
Election organisers , monitors and diplomats all agree that ballot - stuffing , vote buying , intimidation and impersonation are likely to be a problem again .
However , many fear that candidates are focusing on fraud in an unscrupulous attempt to set the ground for complaints if they lose , and risk discouraging voters and discrediting the entire election process along the way . ""
Some of the candidates are issuing statements in their public rallies that my only rival is corruption .
That means he thinks he has won already , and the election is days away , "" said Yusuf Nuristani , chairman of the Independent Election Commission .
"" We hear on the news that if there is corruption people will rise up – it 's scaring people with the threat of potential agitation . ""
This mistrust is not going to help , instead they should tell their followers : ' Stay away from fraud and do n't let others commit fraud , be vigilant , open your eyes , come out in large numbers for voting . '
"" Afghanistan 's election is a watershed moment – the third since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , but the first to herald the country 's peaceful democratic transfer of power .
Huge questions remain over just how peaceful it will be following a volley of Taliban attacks on soft targets in Kabul .
In the five years since 2009 , when more than 1 m votes were disqualified , a raft of measures have been introduced to make cheating harder .
The result , many hope , will be an election tainted but not entirely discredited by cheating .
"" Most of the candidates have confided that they do n't expect an absolutely fraud - free election , what they want to know is that the results reflect the will of the people , "" said Nicholas Haysom , deputy head of the UN in Afghanistan .
"" So the question will focus on how extensive is that fraud , whether it impacts the result and is it capable of being excised .
That is what we need to reassure them , but we want to have an election that is manifestly better than the last election , which means less fraud . ""
One powerbroker interviewed by the Guardianadmitted he had stockpiled voter registration cards needed to cast a ballot ; another promised to bring his district to the polls in return for tens of thousands of dollars .
Elections chief Nuristani has reported one candidate for abusing government resources on the campaign trail and fined another for the same thing .
Yet neither these problems nor a campaign of Taliban violence have diminished enthusiasm , with would - be voters queuing for hours in the freezing pre - dawn dark to secure the voter registration cards they need to cast a ballot .
The same poll that found most Afghans expect fraud also found that four in five plan to vote anyway , said Fefa chairman Ahmad Nader Nadery , because after more than three decades of fighting they prefer a flawed election to the alternatives .
"" They have seen that those who were fighting with each other are now trying to participate in the elections and not use their guns , "" he said .
"" They do understand there is a level of fraud , but they are very much of the view that if the election is not there , the same brutality and violence to fight for power will return . ""
He said the organisation was "" cautiously impressed "" by efforts to rein in the rampant ballot - box stuffing that was the most serious problem in 2009 – when incumbent Hamid Karzai lost about a third of his votes to fraud reviews – and is also seen as the biggest threat this year .
There is a strict barcode - labelling system tracing the ballots from the individual polling station , each of which only get 600 voting papers .
If the station is closed by violence but someone tries to use the votes elsewhere , as happened five years ago , they can be identified and discarded .
Votes will be tallied on site and copies of the results sheet posted outside the ballot station , in the ballot box and sent to Kabul .
Vote - counting will be done twice by two separate teams ; where results differ they will be rechecked .
More than 22,000 monitors from the different campaign teams have registered to watch the voting at more than 6,000 polling centres around the country , as well as more than 1,500 independent observers .
Both numbers are expected to rise rapidly before voting day .
All three men believed to have a serious chance of becoming Afghanistan 's next president mistrust each other , although the greatest public suspicion has fallen on the campaign of Zalmai Rassoul , whose campaign was the one reported to Karzai for abuse of government resources .
A former foreign minister who is believed to have the president 's private backing , he planned retirement on the golf course just a year ago , so has a network far smaller than the other two frontrunners , and has lagged noticeably behind in the few opinion polls published during the race .
But diplomats frustrated by the pre - emptive fraud accusations being batted around say the claims are damaging but also unnecessary , because reforms mean that anyone trying to cheat on a large scale will be caught .
"" I do n't think it 's a particularly helpful line of argument to set the assumption that [ fraud ] is going to happen , "" said US ambassador James Cunningham .
"" If there is any significant fraud , we will have – and the Afghans will have – sufficient transparency that we will know , which is another reason not to engage in it . """
2014-04-07,"Afghanistan has begun tallying votes from the weekend 's historic presidential elections , a process that will take weeks to complete , but rough early counts suggest that the country is heading for a second - round showdown between two former ministers .
Voters defied Taliban intimidation , turning out in unexpectedly high numbers on Saturday to choose a successor to Hamid Karzai , who has ruled for 12 years and is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term .
The Taliban mounted nearly 700 attacks nationwide , said General Zahir Azimy , spokesman for the defence ministry , but fears of a bloody , dramatic attack in the capital or another major city during the election proved unfounded .
The day ended with an outpouring of support for the 350,000 police and soldiers on duty around the country , who for the first time secured an election without foreign support .
Now diplomats and observers are calling for candidates to respect Afghans ' display of trust in their young democracy by allowing election organisers to sort through results and complaints , after all three front - runners said they were confident of success and warned of fraud by other camps . ""
Premature announcements will only undermine this historic political transition process and its democratic , peaceful character , "" the United Nations envoy to Afghanistan , Jan Kubis , warned the groups competing for power .
Eight men are competing to replace Karzai , but none are expected to have scrambled over the 50 % threshold that would mean immediate victory , despite their own optimism , so the top two will probably compete in a run - off scheduled for next month .
Former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah , who was Karzai 's main rival in a 2009 election marred by widespread cheating , had promised his followers a knock - out victory if the government contained fraud .
He is confident that he was doing well despite ballot paper shortages in his strongholds .
"" Our performance has been very good , "" he told the Guardian . ""
[ The fraud ] is not like anything we saw in the earlier election , although there are still worrying signs . ""
Former finance minister and World Bank technocrat Ashraf Ghani posted on his website preliminary results , collated by observers , claiming 57 % of the vote .
The main loser appears to be another former foreign minister , Zalmai Rassoul , a softly spoken moderate who was believed to be Karzai 's preferred successor .
Although the president has stayed strictly neutral in public , he cajoled his brother into abandoning a separate bid for the top office to join a man who has royal blood but only a limited support base .
The official result is not due for over two weeks .
Voting papers have to be collected from around the country , including polling stations so remote that they were transported in on donkeys and must be brought out the same way .
In warehouses in Kabul , tallying of votes by duplicate teams – to limit room for fraud – began on Monday , but the earliest results from the painstaking process are not due for several days .
New anti - fraud measures have given a snapshot of the result , however , which was seized on by campaign teams and journalists around the country .
Each polling station was required to post up a copy of their results for anyone to read or photograph , and the day after the vote details of individual tallies began to circulate online .
There are over 20,000 polling stations so any collection of results is sporadic , and by Monday many results had been torn down or disappeared from polling stations across the city .
However across Kabul , in polling results from areas home to different several different ethnic groups recorded by the Guardian , Abdullah and Ghani switched places at the top .
Rassoul , who had claimed the city 's educated youth as a key group of supporters , rarely came in second and never made first place ."
2014-05-28,"President Hamid Karzai welcomed a US plan to bring home almost all American soldiers from Afghanistan by the end of 2016 , saying the country was ready to take responsibility for its own security and the move could pave the way for Taliban peace talks .
Many Afghans are happy to see their forces in control after years living alongside heavily armed foreign soldiers , but also worry that the shaky national police and armed forces might struggle to hold off insurgents without foreign air power , intelligence and other help .
The top US commander in Afghanistan rushed to assuage those concerns , saying the deal was not a "" zero option "" that would leave the country 's security forces isolated after 2016 , acknowledging critical components such as the fledgling air force would probably get intense and longer - term support .
Funds and equipment would still flow , General Joseph Dunford said , and the handful of troops at the nearby embassy would do more than just guard diplomats inside , continuing with a long - term training mission . ""
President Obama also said we will continue to have a robust military presence in the embassy here to continue with the ' train , advise , assist ' mission subsequent to that time , "" Dunford told a news conference in Kabul .
He declined to comment on the number of soldiers , but the footprint will almost certainly be tiny .
That would allow both Americans weary of the war and Afghans weary of US and Nato troops to claim that the foreign military mission will be over . ""
The end to the US military presence and the takeover by Afghan forces of security responsibilities was a main desire of both the president , the government and of the people of Afghanistan , "" Karzai , who steps down in just over two months , said in a statement .
"" The government of Afghanistan is grateful to the international community for its assistance and remains confident that the Afghan forces will , as they did throughout history , protect their people and territorial integrity with courage and valour , "" he added .
Karzai and others also expressed hope that the drawdown might finally pave the way for elusive progress in long - running efforts to hold peace talks with the Taliban , who often say they are fighting to evict non - believers from their country . ""
The Taliban have always demanded their departure from Afghanistan ... and if we can move towards peace we wo n't need thousands of soldiers , "" said Waheed Mozhdah , analyst and former official in the pre-2001 Taliban government .
"" If the Americans planned to stay for ever , it would be a reason for the war to continue . ""
Still , the Taliban have vowed to fight Afghan forces even as foreign troops head home , denouncing the Kabul government as a puppet regime .
And though the Afghan police and army are much improved since Nato began training in earnest half a decade ago , they still struggle with serious problems from drug abuse to high dropout rates .
Violence is rising nationwide , and alone they are weak on basic capacities from intelligence gathering and heavy weapons to air support and logistics .
The air force not expected to operate independently until 2017 at the earliest .
Women 's rights activist Samira Hamadi said : "" I think this is the right time , it will be a test for the upcoming president .
In terms of our national security forces we have come a long way , they are in the lead now but the important thing is how it will continue . ""
Women 's modest gains of the past decade hang on maintaining security so that they can go out to work or seek justice , she warned .
Along with many others , Hamadi has been closely monitoring the fate of nearby Iraq , where conflict spiralled after the 2011 departure of US forces .
"" Our leaders have to really look at the Iraq situation and study it very closely and make sure they do n't make the mistakes that were made there , "" she said .
"" In Iraq the aid was n't cut off but there was weak leadership and lack of interest in long - term stability . ""

2014-06-14,"Afghans headed to the polls on Saturday morning to choose a successor to President Hamid Karzai and seal the first ever democratic transfer of power in the country 's history .
The run - off election is the second voting day in less than three months after no candidate won more than 50 % in the April poll .
The last vote was hailed as a huge success after voters turned out in unexpectedly high numbers and a barrage of Taliban attacks did little to disrupt polling .
Still , the drawn - out election process has been a huge challenge for a desperately poor country in the grip of a tenacious insurgency .
There were fears on Saturday that voters might stay away after the emotion of the first round dissipated and the Taliban ramped up their threats .
But the weather co - operated and on a sunny morning queues formed outside polling stations around the country before their 7 am opening .
“
It 's the duty of all Afghans to go and vote , ” said 35-year - old Kabul shopkeeper Ahmad Qaseem , waiting outside a city centre polling station for the doors to open .
“
If we vote it helps our country , if we do n't it benefits the Taliban .
The biggest challenge will be to provide security in the provinces – in Kabul
it is OK .
”
The election pits former foreign minister and mujahedeen Dr Abdullah Abdullah , who won 45 % of the vote in the first round , against World Bank technocrat and former finance minster Ashraf Ghani , who claimed 32 % .
The incumbent Karzai was barred by the constitution from standing again after more than a decade in power .
He will hand the winner a poor country whose government is riddled with corruption , almost entirely dependent on foreign aid and facing off against a hardened insurgency .
The Taliban replaced their military commander and have threatened bloodshed after the first round of voting was hailed worldwide as a victory for the government .
They fired several rockets at Kabul airport in the early morning of Saturday but did not cause any casualties .
There were some reports of fighting in other parts of the country but no major attacks in the big urban centres where many people either live or were bussed in to cast their votes .
The other major concern is fraud after hundreds of thousands of votes were thrown out in the first round .
Both candidates have deployed thousands of observers to monitor polling stations across the country and accusations of cheating began even before voting .
On Friday evening supporters of the two camps both sent out the same photo on Twitter purporting to show soldiers with pre - marked ballot papers .
The only difference was which candidate had been selected – each camp showed the tick next to their rival 's name ."
2014-06-14,"Afghans cast their final ballots for a new president this weekend , on a day without major Taliban attacks but also without the heady enthusiasm that accompanied the first round of voting .
The police and army managed to keep major cities mostly calm , despite insurgent threats to target anyone taking part in an election that paves the way for Afghanistan 's first democratic transfer of power .
The incumbent Hamid Karzai was barred by the constitution from standing again .
The Taliban sent suicide bombers into Kandahar but none reached a polling station .
Early morning rockets in Kabul apparently did no damage to the city or people 's voting intentions .
In rural areas casting a ballot was far more risky .
Overall at least 16 police and soldiers and 20 civilians were killed , Reuters quoted the interior ministry saying . ""
Despite more security incidents , rocket attacks , roadside bombs , people still showed up in the most difficult areas , we also saw women in areas we did not expect , "" said Nader Naderi , head of the Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan ( FEFA ) , an independent monitor .
Authorities said turnout matched levels in the first round – around 7 million .
In some parts of the capital ballots papers had run out before midday , and angry voters petitioned election authorities , visiting journalists and anyone with an official identity card for help .
"" We had this problem in the first round and thought it was a mistake , but this time round what should we think ? "" said Samiuddin Samir , a 28-year - old civil servant at a high school , where voting papers were all used up before 11 am .
But enthusiasm was not uniform .
In some areas where two months ago snaking lines of people stood for hours in the rain , there were no queues and hundreds of ballots went unused .
Voter turnout is critical because fewer voters gives fraudulent ballots a greater weight .
If the hard - fought race ends in a close finish , it may also make it easier for the loser to challenge the results or the legitimacy of the entire vote .
Facing off are former mujahideen doctor Abdullah Abdullah and World Bank technocrat Ashraf Ghani .
Both are modernising nationalists who have teamed up with civil war - era strongmen , a bid to broaden their support base that may also have alienated young voters seeking change . ""
Last round I tried to vote
but it was very crowded and ballot papers ran out , "" said 23-year - old Waisuddin Amiri , an unemployed graduate who on Saturday just wandered in to vote with no delay .
"" I 'm not worried about security , this is my chance to choose the person who will serve the country . ""
Fraud remained a major concern after hundreds of thousands of votes were thrown out in April .
Both candidates beefed up their teams of observers , and on Saturday in Kabul they were actively weeding out an underage girl trying to vote with a fake identity card , and stopping election organisers ignoring official paperwork for personal notebooks .
Afghans are now hoping for a fast and relatively clean result , though the election will not be formally settled until July 22 , to allow time to sift through claims of vote rigging and collect ballots from the remotest areas .
Afghanistan can ill afford further delay in an election that has dragged on for months .
Political uncertainty is undermining an already feeble economy , and a deal to keep foreign troops in the country supporting the still - developing Afghan army hinges on a new leader coming to power because Karzai has said he will not sign it .
"" It 's been an eight - month campaign , the fact that Afghans still turned out is a sign of their determination to stick with the process , "" said Saad Mohseni , owner of the influential Tolo Television station , which organised debates between the presidential candidates ."
2014-07-07,"Afghans will finally get preliminary results from their presidential election on Monday – more than three weeks after they went to the polls – but the numbers may only deepen a crisis about who should take over from Hamid Karzai next month .
The figures from the 14 June runoff vote will put former World Bank technocrat Ashraf Ghani clearly in the lead , his supporters and opponents agree .
The dispute that has paralysed the country since the euphoria of a relatively safe election day first dissipated centres on how he came by such a commanding victory .
Abdullah Abdullah , the former mujahideen doctor who faced off against Ghani , claims that 2 m of the votes cast for his rival are fake .
He has officially withdrawn from the vote - counting process , demanding stricter auditing of potentially suspicious votes .
Ghani 's team says that he mobilised clerics , provided transport for would - be voters and persuaded many men from his own Pashtun ethnic group to break with conservative tradition and let their wives , sisters and daughters cast ballots for the first time .
Election authorities had already delayed announcing the winner to check results from nearly 2,000 polling stations for fraud , but both Abdullah and independent observers have called for stricter checks in more than a quarter of voting sites .
European Union election observers have suggested checks on all voting stations with 595 of 600 possible votes cast – at present only 599 out of the 600 votes issued to each station triggers an audit – and areas with unusual ratios of male and female voters .
Members of Abdullah and Ghani 's campaign teams stayed up until the small hours of Sunday morning trying to agree terms for further fraud checks , but spokesmen for both said they had failed to reach a deal .
There are another two weeks allowed for further fraud checks before final results are announced on 24 July .
The new president is due to be sworn into office on 2 August .
Invitations have already been sent out and both Karzai and Ghani say the country can not afford further delays ; Abdullah argues that a clean result is more important than sticking to a timeline .
Afghan power brokers and foreign diplomats have been holding meetings with both camps to try to resolve a crisis that many fear could destabilise the country ; it has already throttled the fragile economy and put at risk long - term military support from Nato .
The dispute has also stirred up old ethnic tensions and fears of violence .
The debate has got so vicious that the government considered blocking Facebook while the results were being settled , though ultimately backed away from a ban ."
2014-07-08,"Former mujahideen doctor Abdullah Abdullah has claimed victory in Afghanistan 's elections , rejecting official results that put him a million votes shy of his rival and deepening the crisis over who will succeed Hamid Karzai as president .
Abdullah on Tuesday told thousands of supporters that he would sacrifice his own life to throw out "" fraudulent results "" , although he stopped just short of announcing a parallel government after stern warnings from Washington that any unilateral move could mean a halt in aid . ""
There is no doubt we are the winners of this election .
We will not let a fake government take power for even one day , "" he told the rally in a cavernous hall in the capital , Kabul .
He asked for time to untangle the crisis , but hinted at plans to unveil his own cabinet , saying : "" The people are waiting for the announcement of our government . ""
Before he arrived angry supporters tore and destroyed down a giant poster of Karzai , who Abdullah claimed helped election opponent Ashraf Ghani cheat his way to victory .
Abdullah condemned the vandalism .
Election authorities on Monday released delayed results from the runoff on 14 June , putting Ghani ahead with 56 % of the vote .
But election commission 's chairman , Ahmad Yusuf Nuristani , also warned that there was not yet a winner , as millions of votes still had to be audited for fraud .
The two candidates have agreed on an audit of results from about 7,000 polling sites that triggered fraud concerns , including places with unusual ratios of male and female voters , and ones where almost all the ballots provided were used .
Abdullah had officially withdrawn from the vote counting process shortly after polling day , and had demanded a hold on the results announcement .
He claimed that up to 2 m ballots cast for Ghani were fraudulent and wanted full checks before any figures were made public .
His spokesman was quick to describe the release of the preliminary figures as a "" coup "" , and within hours one of Abdullah 's most powerful backers , the governor of Balkh province , Atta Mohammad Noor , warned of "" widespread civil unrest "" .
Ghani dismissed concerns that Afghanistan 's stability was at risk , saying he respected his rival as a "" national figure "" , and hinting at the possibility of a unity government . ""
Talk of parallel governments will remain at the level of talk , because of the historic responsibility that his excellency Dr Abdullah and I … have to ensure the stability of this country , "" he told reporters , after confirming he fully backed a wider audit of the results .
"" We do not have preconditions for political discussions because we must engage in finding solutions ... to ensure the legitimacy of the process , its fairness and the acceptance of its results . ""
Ghani appears to be softening his stance on giving Abdullah a stake in government , in the face of the fast - growing crisis .
He had previously insisted that were he to be declared winner , his election rival would have to concede defeat before any discussion of jobs could begin .
The international community have responded cautiously to the results , with both the US and the UN calling on election authorities to move ahead swiftly with plans to audit another 3 m of the 8 m votes cast – an unexpectedly high turnout .
The US secretary of state , John Kerry , also issued a stern warning against resorting to violence , threats of violence , or abandoning the messy democratic process .
"" I have noted reports of protests in Afghanistan and of suggestions of a parallel government with the gravest concern , "" Kerry said , calling on the Afghan security forces to stay neutral . ""
Any action to take power by extra - legal means will cost Afghanistan the financial and security support of the United States and the international community .
"" If the current standoff can be resolved , the new president should be inaugurated on 2 August in Afghanistan 's first ever democratic transfer of power .
Any delays will likely strain an economy already undermined by political uncertainty and escalate security concerns as the last Nato combat troops head home ."
2014-07-08,"The former World Bank technocrat Ashraf Ghani has a million - vote lead in preliminary results from Afghanistan 's presidential poll – but election organisers warned that with more fraud checks pending there was no winner yet .
Afghanistan has been plunged into crisis about who will take over from Hamid Karzai next month , after fraud accusations stained an election initially hailed as a triumph for the country 's fledgling democracy .
Yusuf Nuristani , the chairman of Afghanistan 's independent election commission , announced an unexpectedly high turnout of more than eight million voters in the June runoff vote , up by more than 20 % from the first round of the election in April .
But he warned that security , government and election officials had all been caught trying to skew the election , while some media outlets had presented partisan pundits as impartial analysts .
"" We ca n't deny there have been fraud and violations in the runoff , "" Nuristani said at a news conference delayed for more than four hours while the two candidates argued over rules for further checks on fraud . ""
The announcement of preliminary results does n't mean that a winner has been declared .
After the scrutiny , audit and investigation of all complaints , change is possible .
"" The results put Ghani in the lead , as both teams had expected .
The number of voters who backed him more than doubled from the first round , to 4.5 million , or 56 % of all valid ballots .
The dispute that has paralysed the country since the euphoria of a relatively safe election day first dissipated is how he came by such a commanding victory .
On Monday night John Kerry , the US secretary of state , warned that any attempt to take power illegally in Afghanistan following the disputed run - off would cost the country US support .
"" I have noted reports of protests in Afghanistan and of suggestions of a ' parallel government ' with the gravest concern , "" he said in a statement issued by the US embassy in Kabul . ""
Any action to take power by extra - legal means will cost Afghanistan the financial and security support of the United States and the international community . ""
Earlier a US state department official acknowledged that "" serious allegations of fraud have been raised and have yet to be adequately investigated "" .
Abdullah Abdullah , the former mujahideen doctor who faced off against Ghani , claims that two million of the ballots cast for his rival are fake .
He has officially withdrawn from the vote - counting process , demanding stricter auditing of potentially suspicious votes , and pushed hard for the release of results to be delayed .
He has also published audio tapes he claims show a top election official conspiring to stuff ballot boxes for Ghani , using a crude code of "" stuffed sheep "" .
The man Abdullah said was captured on the tapes stepped down but protested his innocence , saying he had resigned only in the interests of national unity .
The increase in support for Ghani between the first and second rounds was dramatic .
In central Wardak province 10 times as many voters came to the polls to back him , while in southern Kandahar voter support was six times higher than in the first round .
Other provinces saw tripling or quadrupling of ballots cast for him .
Ghani 's team say he mobilised clerics , provided transport for would - be voters and persuaded many men from his own Pashtun ethnic group to break with conservative tradition and let their wives , sisters and daughters vote for the first time .
Election authorities had already delayed announcing results to check votes from nearly 2,000 polling stations for fraud , but eventually threw out less than 12,000 ballots .
Both Abdullah and some independent observers have called for stricter checks taking in over a quarter of voting sites .
There are another two weeks allowed for further auditing before final results are announced on 24 July .
The new president is then due to be sworn into office on 2 August .
Invitations have already been sent out and Ghani says the country can not afford further delays because uncertainty is throttling the fragile economy and putting long - term military support from Nato at risk .
Abdullah argues that the country can not sacrifice a fair election for an arbitrary timeline .
The dispute has also stirred up old ethnic tensions and fears of violence .
The debate has got so vicious that the government considered blocking Facebook while the results were being settled , though ultimately backed away from the ban ."
2014-07-10,"Afghanistan 's president Hamid Karzai has thrown his support behind a UN plan to audit 3.5 million ballots for fraud , equivalent to nearly half the votes cast in the country 's disputed presidential poll , his spokesman said .
The decision came hours before US secretary of state John Kerry flew in to Kabul for a last - ditch effort to defuse Afghanistan 's rapidly escalating political crisis and help restart the stalled election process . ""
The Afghan government backs this proposal , "" said Karzai 's spokesman Aimal Faizi , adding that it would cover 8,000 polling stations and some 43 % of all votes cast .
"" From the beginning the president 's position was that this should be a purely Afghan process but we are not in an ideal situation , there are problems and we should find … a responsible solution . ""
Preliminary results from the 14 June run - off poll put former World Bank technocrat Ashraf Ghani more than a million votes in the lead , but even election organisers warned that no winner could be declared until more ballots were thoroughly scanned for fraud .
The trailing candidate , former mujahideen doctor Abdullah Abdullah , has accused Ghani of industrial - scale cheating .
After the first official figures were released his backers called for a parallel government , warned of unrest and tore down posters of Karzai who they accuse of colluding in fraud .
The US responded with a stern warning that vital security and government aid will stop if Afghanistan abandons the democratic process , and hours later Abdullah told his supporters he needed time to push for more fraud checks .
Among the ballots he wants scanned are those from polling stations with unusually high ratios of female voters for the highly conservative country , or where almost all ballot papers have been used up .
His demands for wider checks have been echoed by some observers , including a European Union monitoring mission .
Both candidates and the election organisers , along with the official vote watchdog , will need to agree to the UN - drafted plan , but Ghani has already said he backs a wide audit and would reject any of his votes that are found to be fraudulent .
The sweep of the proposed audit will likely make it hard for Abdullah to refuse , particularly as he had originally asked the UN to mediate , in defiance of Karzai 's insistence for several years that foreigners should play no role in the vote .
Kerry has form for helping Afghanistan sort through thorny election disputes .
In 2009 he spent hours meeting with Karzai to resolve a similar stand - off about fraud .
Karzai 's opponent then was also Abdullah , but there is a sense that this year 's dispute may be harder to resolve , as Abdullah has spent five years crafting his campaign and felt victory was within reach after coming out of the first round of voting far ahead of Ghani .
The final results are due to be announced on 24 July and a new president inaugurated on 2 August , and Karzai is insistent about sticking to that schedule .
The political uncertainly lingering over the country for months now has paralysed the economy and put long - term Western security support at risk , both pressures that fragile Afghanistan can ill afford . ""
The president has given the date ( for the inauguration ) and it has to be respected , "" Karzai 's spokesman said .
"" The president has no willingness to stay in power more than the period required . ""
However if the audit goes ahead , its hard to see how those deadlines can be met , simply because of the time required to sift through so many voting papers .
Tentative UN estimates suggest it is likely to take at least two weeks even if work starts soon and audit teams are well resourced ."
2014-07-11,"The US secretary of state , John Kerry , has arrived in Kabul amid a tense standoff between Afghanistan 's two presidential candidates that threatens to derail the country 's first democratic handover of power .
In meetings with both candidates , Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani , Kerry hopes to resolve the tension by arriving at mutually agreeable criteria for an audit of votes .
Hours before Kerry 's visit , the outgoing Afghan president Hamid Karzai endorsed a UN proposal to audit 8,000 polling stations , a plan that was accepted by the Ghani camp on Friday morning .
Discussions with the Abdullah campaign were continuing .
It is unclear whether the proposed audit would be complete by 22 July , when the final results are due , or even by 2 August , when the newly elected president is to be inaugurated .
There may be strong incentive , however , as US officials have warned that if the process were to be delayed , Afghanistan would run the risk of losing its much - needed aid .
Confidence in the electoral process has plummeted since the 14 June runoff , when Abdullah accused his rival of fraud on a massive scale , a claim Ghani denies .
Kerry 's last - minute visit to Afghanistan was the latest indication of how dire the situation had become .
Both parties hope his visit may bring the impetus to break the weeks - long political stasis .
The gulf between the two camps remains wide and it is unclear whether Kerry will be able to bridge the gap in an atmosphere of mistrust .
On Monday , both parties appeared on the cusp of an agreement that would have found a mutually acceptable way of identifying fraudulent votes .
But the following morning Abdullah declared himself the winner in an emotional speech to a crowd of supporters who tore down a portrait of Karzai and replaced it with a photograph of Abdullah .
The need for a solution is becoming more pressing as the situation in the country becomes more volatile .
Prospects for a full - blown civil war appear slim , but there are growing fears of violence spilling on to the streets .
Both candidates are supported by strongmen who have been warring for decades , and may decide that swift and decisive military action is the only way out of the impasse .
Given the high stakes , both sides welcomed Kerry 's intervention .
Spokesmen for the Ghani and Abdullah have said that all direct contact between the two candidates has been severed since the runoff – they had been communicating through the UN and mediation teams .
Both expressed hopes that this stalemate would come to an end , but have shown little sign of yielding their positions .
Mahmoud Saikal , Abdullah campaign 's spokesman , referred to Kerry 's visit as "" an opportunity to explain to him what really happened "" .
Hamidullah Farooqi , spokesman for Ghani 's campaign , said his camp remained bitter about Abdullah 's perceived inconsistency , pointing to his "" ever - changing demands "" .
Farooqi added : "" If we want the democratic process to continue , we have to stick to the rules .
You can not change the rules 90 minutes into the game . ""
Their demands have changed six , no , seven times , in the past two weeks .
Every day – every day – we wake up and there is a different ask . ""
Both candidates have been campaigning since submitting their nomination papers in October 2013 , and some of their supporters expressed fatigue as the process dragged into its 10th month with no sign of a resolution .
A spokesman for Abdullah said his camp wanted a robust audit that would "" scrub the dirty votes from the clean votes "" .
If this were to fail , they would be open to pursuing "" other political options "" , the spokesman continued , declining to say what those would be .
Speculation in Kabul has included the possibility that the losing candidate could receive a new post , such as a prime minister 's job , which would allow for some degree of power - sharing .
But Farooqi maintains that a deal of this kind is off the table .
Amid the bickering , there was also a sense that Kerry 's visit may indicate a failure of Afghanistan 's fledgling democratic process .
Farooqi , perhaps recognising this , said US recommendations would be welcome as long as they fell within the bounds of Afghanistan 's legal framework . ""
Even Mr Kerry can not replace and laws and institutions of this country , "" he said ."
2014-09-30,"Afghanistan and the US have signed a long - delayed agreement to allow international forces to stay in the country beyond 2014 .
In a low - key ceremony at the presidential palace , the Afghan national security adviser and the US ambassador signed the bilateral security agreement in the presence of the new Afghan president , Ashraf Ghani .
Hamid Karzai , Ghani ’s predecessor , refused to sign the pact for more than a year , frustrating international partners who would have had to begin withdrawing material and personnel soon without it .
The deal also ensures aid will continue to come from Nato countries .
“
Our army needs help from [ the ] United States and Nato .
Not only on the security side but also financially , ” says Abbas Noyan , a Ghani spokesman .
“
Many have been waiting for a positive sign from the Afghan government of their desire for an international presence in the country , ” says Nato ’s spokesman in Afghanistan , Christopher Chambers .
“
It also sends a very strong message to the Afghan people about our concrete commitment to continuing our support .
”
Under the terms of the agreement , signed by national security adviser Mohammad Hanif Atmar and US ambassador James Cunningham , about 12,000 foreign troops are expected to stay to train and assist Afghan security forces after the US - led combat mission formally ends at the end of 2014 .
Although a significant reduction from the 41,000 Nato troops currently in the country , this international commitment to counter - insurgency is vital , said Mohammad Isaqzadeh , a political analyst in Kabul .
“
It is the single most important agreement for the sustenance of the Afghan security forces , ” he said .
“
It guarantees the survival of the Afghan forces .
”
In fact , the thinning international presence is already being felt .
Insurgents have spent the summer testing the resilience of the government ’s army and police , unleashing some of the worst violence since the war began .
Taking advantage of a lengthy election crisis , and buoyed by fighters escaping bombing campaigns in Pakistan , Taliban have gained ground in crucial areas .
In Sangin , a district of Helmand province that British soldiers helped protect for more than a decade , more than 200 government forces lost their lives over the summer .
In the north of the country , where a large contingency of German troops is based , militants are squeezing the city of Kunduz .
Last week , at least 60 people were killed when Taliban attacked a district in Ghazni province , 93 miles ( 150 km ) southwest of Kabul , burning down houses and decapitating civilians .
At the recent Nato summit in Newport , Wales , the alliance committed $ 4.1bn ( £ 2.5bn ) in annual security support to Afghanistan .
However , with the annual bill running at $ 5.5bn ( £ 3.4bn ) , Afghanistan ’s 350,000-strong army and police force is underfinanced and its personnel may soon have to be cut by a third .
The signing of Tuesday ’s deal not only bolsters the security forces .
It is also an early boost to the new government .
When he was inaugurated on Monday , Ghani swore in his election opponent Abdullah Abdullah as the government chief executive in a newly hatched arrangement brokered by the US and fiercely derided by the Taliban .
With its first win in the bag , Ghani and Abdullah demonstrated resolve , says Isaqzadeh .
“
And it will demoralize the Taliban because it shows that the US supports the political agreement , ” he added ."
2014-10-07,"Five Afghan men are due to be executed on Wednesday for the gang rape of four women , after a trial that drew criticism from international observers and a nationwide outcry over the attack .
The attorney general ’s office said the convicted men would be hanged at a prison in Kabul , after the sentence was reviewed by three courts and signed by Hamid Karzai in one of his last acts as president .
“
It is also at the request of the public that they should be hanged for the sort of crimes they committed , ” said Ibrahim Khil , an adviser to the attorney general .
The sentences were administered with such swiftness that some worry that the court caved to mob justice .
The verdicts were based entirely on confessions , which all five defendants claim were obtained by police torture .
Human rights organisations say the trial was marred by inconsistencies , lack of due process and political interference .
Karzai , who has usually opposed capital punishment , declared before the trial had begun that he wanted the suspects sentenced to death .
On 23 August , four women were travelling with their husbands through Paghman , a district of Kabul province , when their cars were pulled over by 10 men , some of them armed and in police uniforms .
The men robbed and beat the travellers and raped the women within earshot of the husbands .
Two weeks later , seven suspects were convicted , but not of rape .
In what was said to be an attempt to avoid further public humiliation of the victims , the suspects were charged with armed robbery and adultery , known as zina .
Five were sentenced to death and two to 20 years in prison .
While rape cases are not uncommon in Afghanistan , the scale of the incident transfixed the country , and protesters in Kabul called for the public execution of the convicted men .
“
If these seven people were not sentenced to death , it would be a large disgrace and insult to women all over the country , ” said Khalida , 38 , a schoolteacher .
She said this kind of justice was necessary for women to feel able to leave the house , go to work and take part in public life .
“
I expect them to be hanged in public in front of all women and the people of Afghanistan , ” she said .
The new president , Ashraf Ghani , has received praise for his first week in office , signing a much - delayed security agreement with international forces , reopening a large bank fraud case and promising to fight harassment of schoolgirls .
But the Paghman case has prompted some concerns that the rule of law will be an early victim in Afghanistan ’s difficult transition period .
The United States has spent more than $ 900 m ( £ 560 m ) to improve Afghanistan ’s judiciary system since 2001 .
“
In view of the serious flaws and weaknesses that have been exposed in the course of this prosecution and trial , [ the execution ] would send a very negative signal , ” said David Griffiths , Asia - Pacific deputy director at Amnesty International .
He said that although many women had called for the five convicts to be executed , the verdict was not a victory for them .
“
It would be terribly misguided to view this sentence as a way of promoting women ’s rights .
”
The diplomatic community has asked Ghani to reverse the decision of his predecessor .
“
I have made it clear to [ Ghani ] that we would like to see him reverse the former president ’s edict , ” said the EU ’s ambassador to Kabul , Franz - Michael Mellbin .
“
Miscarriage of justice is always a risk in a justice system as weak as the Afghan .
It is especially worrying because the death penalty is irreversible .
”
Although public executions are a relic from the time of the Taliban regime , Afghanistan still executes several prisoners a year .
The Paghman five will be the first this year .
Two convicts were executed in 2013 , and 14 in 2012 .
Capital punishment draws widespread support from Afghans , some of whom would like to see it administered more often .
“
Every day people who have the power commit crimes like these , ” said Ahmad Rashad Rezai , an engineering student in Kabul .
“
They rape poor families and the government does n’t punish those people .
”"
2014-11-14,"It has been a long time since Pakistan ’s diplomats and politicians have truly looked forward to a visit from the president of Afghanistan .
Senior officials who dealt with Hamid Karzai still shudder at the memory of a deeply mercurial man whose attitude towards Pakistan veered wildly between occasional spasms of warmth and long periods of outright hostility .
So the arrival in Islamabad on Friday of Karzai ’s successor Ashraf Ghani making his first visit to Pakistan has triggered an outbreak of optimism .
“
There is a real desire among both the military and civilians to start a new chapter with Ghani , ” said one diplomat .
“
In the end they all just found Karzai too difficult .
”
There will be extensive opportunities to woo the new president during his two - day visit , during which he will join the Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , in watching a cricket match between teams representing the two nations .
In recent weeks Pakistan ’s de facto foreign minister , its army chief and its spy master have all visited Kabul carrying what were described as messages of support and cooperation .
The army offered to help train Afghan soldiers and provide equipment for an entire infantry brigade .
But in a region wracked by terrorism and insecurity , fixing the fraught relationship between the two countries could reap far bigger dividends than just military training and matériel .
Most experts believe that if the two feuding neighbours were to bury the hatchet , the chances of increased stability in the region would increase dramatically .
It is thought that Pakistan – if it wished – could push the Taliban towards a peace process that the international community has struggled with for years .
Pakistan ’s undoubted influence over the Taliban is due to the fact that the insurgent group enjoys safe haven inside the country .
The security establishment , despite Pakistan nominally being a US ally , has long been accused of covertly assisting the Taliban and other insurgent groups – most recently in an report by the US defence department .
Adding to the murk of the region ’s so - called double game , in the last year Pakistan has publicly accused Afghanistan of also supporting terrorists .
It says Kabul deliberately turned a blind eye to the presence of senior members of the Pakistani Taliban , an allied movement that aims to topple the Pakistani state , who are hiding in the Afghan borderlands .
Mushahid Hussain , a senator who takes a close interest in Afghan affairs , said : “ With ‘ fighting fatigue’ on either side of the Durand line [ the disputed border between the two countries ] , both countries feel the need to grasp this new opportunity .
”
Afghanistan has never accepted the Durand line , which in 1893 gave swaths of Afghan territory to the British empire – land that now lies inside Pakistan .
The issue has soured relations ever since : Afghanistan tried to block Pakistan ’s admission to the United Nations in 1947 , and in the 1970s Kabul was particularly vocal in claiming its lost territory .
That prompted Pakistan to train and arm anti - government Islamist groups in Afghanistan for the first time , a tactic that was later greatly increased in the 1980s and 1990s .
Even in recent years when there has been little serious discussion about redrawing borders , Islamabad has been repeatedly angered by Karzai ’s attempts to present himself as a leader of Pakistani Pashtuns , the ethnic group that predominates in Afghanistan .
Pakistan ’s worries are heightened by its anxiety that arch - enemy India is attempting to encircle it through its extensive diplomatic and development presence in Afghanistan .
Pakistan ’s past attempts to get Afghanistan to heed its concerns triggered some of Karzai ’s most bitter outbursts against a country that is deeply unpopular with ordinary Afghans .
Martine van Bijlert , an expert at the Afghanistan Analysts Network , said : “ Ghani can be quite temperamental himself and also has a feel for populism .
He may play this coolly and diplomatically , or much more emotionally .
”
Despite the deep roots of an old conflict , Hussain said he was optimistic that things could improve , not least because China – Pakistan ’s closest ally – is increasingly anxious for the decade - long insurgencies in Afghanistan and Pakistan to end .
Beijing is worried about the threat from some of its own Islamist militants from the western province of Xinjiang currently fighting in the borderlands straddling the Durand line .
Moreover , Pakistan and Afghanistan are both faced with a fundamental new reality as the US withdraws troops from the region , said Hussain .
“ Islamabad and Kabul now realise that regional countries will have to largely fend for themselves , no longer banking on distant godfathers in Washington to pull their chestnuts out of the fire . ”"
2015-02-13,"Pervez Musharraf , the former Pakistani military ruler accused of sheltering and supporting the Taliban after 2001 , has called for an end to the backing of militant “ proxies ” in Afghanistan .
In an interview with the Guardian , Musharraf admitted that when he was in power , Pakistan sought to undermine the government of former Afghan president Hamid Karzai because Karzai had “ helped India stab Pakistan in the back ” .
But now the time had come to “ totally cooperate ” with Ashraf Ghani , the Afghan president since September , who Musharraf believes is “ the last hope for peace in the region ” .
“
In President Karzai ’s times , yes , indeed , he was damaging Pakistan and therefore we were working against his interest .
Obviously we had to protect our own interest , ” Musharraf said .
“
But now President Ashraf Ghani has come and he is trying to restore balance in Afghanistan .
We must totally cooperate with him .
”
In his first months in office , Ghani has sought to woo Pakistan in a way Musharraf could only have dreamed of in the critical years between the US - led intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 , and 2008 , when Musharraf was finally forced from power .
Ghani has not only suspended a planned weapons deal with India , but also diverted troops to fight against anti - Pakistan militant groups in eastern Afghanistan .
For Musharraf , the most welcome development was Ghani ’s decision this month to send six army cadets for training at Pakistan ’s officer academy in the town of Abbottabad .
Karzai infuriated both Musharraf and Ashfaq Kayani , his successor as army chief , by spurning offers to help train Afghanistan ’s embryonic army .
Instead , Karzai sent cadets to India , where Musharraf believes they were “ indoctrinated ” against Pakistan .
Speaking in his luxurious Karachi home , the former army chief repeatedly hinted at what is now widely accepted among diplomats and analysts : that the nominal western ally assisted both Nato forces in Afghanistan and the Taliban they were fighting against in a bid to counter the perceived influence of arch - rival India .
“ Pakistan had its own proxies , India had its proxies , which is unhealthy .
I do admit this , it is most unhealthy .
It is not in favour of Afghanistan , or Pakistan or India .
It must stop , ” he said .
Musharraf said Pakistani spies in the Inter - Services Intelligence directorate ( ISI ) cultivated the Taliban after 2001 because Karzai ’s government was dominated by non - Pashtuns , the country ’s largest ethnic group , and officials who were thought to favour India .
“
Obviously we were looking for some groups to counter this Indian action against Pakistan , ” he said .
“
That is where the intelligence work comes in .
Intelligence being in contact with Taliban groups .
Definitely they were in contact , and they should be .
”
The army remains deeply suspicious of India , a country that has beaten Pakistan in three conflicts since independence and played a critical role in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 .
Musharraf insists he is not an “ India hater
” , but bristles at what he says is western bias towards Pakistan ’s giant neighbour .
“
‘ India is the greatest democracy , promoter of human rights and democratic culture’ ?
All bullshit , ” he said .
“
There is no human rights .
The religion itself is anti - human rights .
In the rural areas , if even the shadow of an untouchable goes on a pandit , that man can be killed .
”
Like many soldiers , he is convinced that India , through its Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ) , backs regional separatists in an effort to break up Pakistan .
“
The RAW of India , the ISI of Pakistan have always been fighting against each other since our independence .
That is how it continued , it continues now also .
“
It must stop , but it can only stop when leaderships on both sides show the will to resolve disputes and stop confrontation in favour of compromise and accommodation .
”
Musharraf has become increasingly vocal in recent months as his position in the country steadily improves after he suffered a series of setbacks in the wake of his disastrous return from self - exile in 2013 .
A ban on standing in elections quashed his hopes of entering parliament .
He was ensnared by a series of legal cases , including one murder charge .
Most seriously of all , Nawaz Sharif , the prime minister Musharraf ousted in a coup in 1999 , won a landslide victory and initiated a treason trial for which the former dictator could be hanged if found guilty .
But Sharif ’s power has been curbed by a series of bruising fights with Pakistan ’s powerful military establishment and the treason case now appears tied up in legal wrangling .
Musharraf is still banned from leaving the country , which he says deprives him not just of the lucrative international lecture circuit , but also access to his homes in London and Dubai .
He says he misses his old life in his two favourite cities , where he could go to restaurants alone without the vast security required to protect him in Pakistan .
But he says his problems are nearly behind him , and that he has the army to thank .
“
I ’m very proud of my institution .
Whatever they are doing to help me , to protect the honour and dignity of their ex - chief , I ’m proud of that , ” he said ."
2015-02-19,"After more than a decade of war , formal talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban will begin in the coming weeks , the country ’s president has told key aides .
According to a senior government official , the president , Ashraf Ghani , believes meetings could begin in early March after Pakistan signalled its support for the move .
Previous western - sponsored attempts to get Afghan government and Taliban representatives around the same table failed under Ghani ’s predecessor , Hamid Karzai .
Although the Afghan Taliban ’s spokesman denied there were any plans for talks , hopes are rising following Pakistan ’s decision to pressurise the insurgent leadership .
On Tuesday , Gen Raheel Sharif , Pakistan ’s powerful military chief , travelled to Kabul to tell Ghani the Taliban were increasingly amenable to discussions .
Pakistan has considerable influence over the Taliban , a movement that was supported by Islamabad in the 1990s and which since 2001 has been free to use Pakistani territory to launch attacks against the western - backed government in Kabul .
Since becoming president last year , Ghani has worked assiduously to secure Pakistan ’s help in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table by addressing Pakistani fears that Afghanistan is a base for its enemies .
Ghani has won plaudits from Islamabad by putting on a hold an arms deal with Pakistan ’s arch - rival India and by deploying troops against anti - Pakistan militants based in Afghan territory .
In return Ghani expects Pakistan to tell the Taliban to enter negotiations and drastically reduce the surge in militant attacks inside Afghanistan .
Sartaj Aziz , the foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan ’s prime minister , said reports of an immediate breakthrough were premature but that progress had been made amid the “ quite unprecedented ” improvement in relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
“
These things have been going on for the last few weeks , ” he said , referring to contacts between Taliban and the Afghan government .
“
We suggest the right kind of people to talk to and that kind of thing , but this is an Afghan - led process .
”
Pakistan has also been pressured to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table by powerful ally China , which is alarmed by the overspill of militancy in the region into western China .
Previous attempts to find a political solution to the 13-year war in Afghanistan came to nothing .
In 2013 , the Taliban was allowed to open an “ office ” in Doha , the capital of the Gulf state of Qatar , where talks could be held .
But the process collapsed before it could begin after the Afghan government reacted furiously to the Taliban being allowed to raise their flag over the building as if it was the embassy of a sovereign power .
On Thursday , the US embassy in Kabul denied reported claims by Afghan Taliban sources that insurgent leaders would hold an initial round of talks with US officials as early as Thursday .
“
There is no truth to the reports of US involvement in direct talks with the Taliban , ” a US diplomat said .
Ajmal Obaid Abidy , spokesman for Ghani , said the international community had accepted demands that peace talks be conducted between the Afghan government and the Taliban , not with outside actors .
So the reports of directs talks between the US and the Taliban , Abidy said , “ are only rumours ” .
Michael Semple , one of the world ’s experts on the movement , said Doha was the most likely site of any talks as the Taliban ’s “ political commission ” is already based there .
But he warned there was no guarantee talks would succeed given the Taliban have ramped up attacks in recent months .
“
I do n’t think we ’ve seen the signs on the Taliban side that they are preparing to end the war , ” he said .
“
Maybe there will be a round of talks , but the real test will be whether there will be another spring military campaign .
”
Afghan analysts say Ghani will not be able to sustain his tilt towards Pakistan , which is proving unpopular with sections of the public , unless he is rewarded with a sharp decline in violence .
This week Ghani attempted to sooth the concerns of powerbrokers , including former president Hamid Karzai , who was famously distrustful of Pakistan .
“
Ghani ’s biggest challenge is if the coffins keep coming , ” said Bilal Sarwary , one of the country ’s top journalists .
“
But the Taliban have only been preparing to fight .
”"
2015-03-09,"Afghanistan ’s historic struggles against British imperialism and Soviet invasion will have been in vain if the country succumbs to pressure from neighbouring Pakistan , Hamid Karzai has warned in an interview with the Guardian .
The former president of Afghanistan made his remarks at a time when his successor , Ashraf Ghani , has overturned the country ’s traditionally hostile relationship with Pakistan in the hope of enlisting its help in brokering a peace deal with the Taliban .
Several once - unthinkable concessions made to Pakistan in recent months have horrified Karzai and many of the men who helped him rule for more than a decade .
“
We want a friendly relationship but not to be under Pakistan ’s thumb , ” he said .
It is a view many think Ghani can not afford to ignore , given how many people agree with Karzai , a familiar and charismatic figure who remains in the thick of Afghan politics .
The man who famously never took a holiday while in power rushed back early from a recent break in China to his new home and office complex in Kabul , a scaled - down version of the capital ’s 19th - century presidential palace .
As well as maintaining many of the trappings of the head of state , he continues to behave like one , receiving a daily stream of officials , foreign ambassadors and tribal delegations from across the country .
Karzai rejected any suggestion he is at the centre of what one of his former colleagues describes as an emerging “ pocket of opposition ” to Ghani .
“
Yes , I have differences , but I will not say anything , ” Karzai said .
“ I will keep mum , giving advice to President Ghani in private .
I absolutely support this government .
”
Despite professing loyalty , Karzai sharply criticised some of Ghani ’s key innovations , such as the decision last month to send six army cadets to Pakistan for officer training .
Karzai ’s willingness to send men to India while spurning Pakistan
enraged Pakistan ’s generals , who believed the future leaders of the Afghan army were being indoctrinated by their mortal enemies .
“
We should not send troops for training in any of the neighbouring countries , particularly when they are sending us suicide bombers in return , ” Karzai said – a reference to the fact that the leadership of the Taliban , and much of the movement ’s organisational and logistical muscle , is allowed to operate freely inside Pakistan .
Last month , Pakistan ’s former military ruler Pervez Musharraf admitted in a Guardian interview that his country ’s intelligence agency had links with the Taliban because India and Pakistan were engaged in a “ proxy war ” in Afghanistan .
It reflected the longstanding view of Pakistan ’s strategic thinkers who have argued Afghanistan must not be allowed to become too friendly with arch - enemy India .
But subservience to any foreign power is something Karzai says Afghans will never submit to , even if resistance involves huge hardships .
“
I am a pacifist , I abhor violence – we would have been much better off if we had never fought against the Soviet Union , ” he said referring to the epic insurgency by the Mujahideen in the 1980s .
“
But if we give up control over our own foreign policy then all the wars fought by Afghanistan against the British 100 years ago , and the Soviet Union , will be in vain , ” he said .
Karzai ’s associates spoke even more frankly about their anger at Ghani ’s Pakistan policy .
Rangin Dadfar Spanta , a former foreign minister and national security adviser who sat in on the Guardian ’s meeting with Karzai , said the policy amounts to the humiliating “ appeasement ” of a hostile power who would never change its ways .
He is alarmed by Ghani ’s effort to keep India , the region ’s superpower , at a distance .
In a sign of Delhi ’s displeasure , work has already stalled on some key Indian - backed development projects in Afghanistan , Spanta claimed .
Spanta and many others are amazed at what they see as Ghani ’s one - sided willingness to militarily support Pakistan while getting very little in return .
Ghani has sent troops to eastern Afghanistan to battle the Tehrik - i - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , a group focused on attacking Pakistan , while the Afghan Taliban continue to enjoy security on the other side of the border .
Pakistan has also been given access to TTP prisoners held in Afghanistan .
One former senior member of the Karzai regime said he was shocked to learn Ghani held meetings with Rizwan Akhtar , Pakistan ’s spy chief , without the presence of his opposite number , Afghanistan ’s intelligence chief , Rahmatullah Nabil .
The extraordinary series of recent meetings between Pakistan and Afghanistan ’s civilian and military leaderships in both Islamabad and Kabul has stung Karzai , said one diplomat .
Although he visited Islamabad 21 times during his tenure , brief periods of cordial relations soon collapsed into acrimony .
With public distrust , even hatred , of Pakistan running so deep , Ghani urgently needs to show his policy is bearing fruit .
Making matters more pressing is the unhappiness of many of the country ’s power brokers with the “ national unity government ” Ghani was compelled to form with his rival Abdullah Abdullah after last year ’s botched presidential election , which was spoiled by massive electoral fraud .
The attempt to share power cut the number of jobs available to appease disgruntled backers of both men .
Causing further annoyance is Ghani ’s effort to exclude from power what one diplomat in Kabul calls “ mafia business types ” whom Karzai was always careful to keep close , even at the cost of government dysfunction and corruption .
“
The mafia types are very unhappy with the way things are going and are moving towards Karzai and others , ” the diplomat said .
“
Signs of progress on peace talks , or a blunting of the spring offensive , has become politically very important for Ghani .
”
The president is banking on Pakistan using its influence over the Taliban to force insurgent representatives to hold official , face - to - face talks with the Afghan government that might ultimately lead to a political settlement and an end to the conflict over the next few years .
In the short term , government officials desperately hope the Taliban will agree ceasefires after violence that has seen civilians and members of the armed forces killed in record numbers .
Hopes of a breakthrough have risen amid the unprecedented series of meetings between Ghani and Pakistan ’s army chief , who has assured the Afghan leader of a growing appetite within the Taliban for talks .
A secret , preliminary meeting between officials and the Taliban has already taken place to discuss where and when the first formal meeting might happen , according to a western diplomat in Islamabad .
But the public ’s widespread yearning for peace is balanced with disquiet over Ghani ’s tilt towards Pakistan .
That is likely to grow if the Taliban continue their attacks .
“
There could be a bloody summer , there will be fighting and there will be disappointments on the dialogue table from time to time , ” predicted Omar Daudzai , one of the most influential officials of the Karzai era who served as chief of staff and interior minister .
Daudzai , a former ambassador to Islamabad , said he thought Ghani ’s attempts to woo Pakistan were “ courageous ” but would ultimately fail to change the country ’s behaviour .
“
He has taken controversial steps that his predecessor did n’t take , and now we have to wait to see whether the Pakistani side is sincere or not , ” he said .
“
But I am far more sceptical than I ever was before about Pakistan ’s sincerity .
”"
2015-07-12,"A stone ’s throw from the presidential palace in Kabul , you can see the lines of dignitaries awaiting their appointments from early in the morning : tribal leaders and elders from across the country queue up to get inside , where the audience also counts foreign ambassadors and cabinet ministers .
It ’s not , however , the current Afghan president they are queuing to see , but his predecessor at his nearby city centre residence .
Nine months after he relinquished power in Kabul , Hamid Karzai is a lingering , but formidable presence on the political scene , and his influence and interventions are increasingly seen as a threat to Afghanistan ’s political stability .
The former president has curtailed the erratic behaviour that so irritated his international partners during his near - decade long rule , casting himself as a genial statesman and supposed unifier of the country .
The new president , Ashraf Ghani , has failed deliver on promises to jumpstart the economy , struggled to appoint officials to key security positions , and risked significant political capital by making overtures to Pakistan .
Given its history of harbouring insurgents , Ghani ’s pivot to Pakistan is controversial , and Karzai ’s response has been ambiguous .
In an interview with the Guardian in March Karzai insisted he would keep quiet and advise Ghani behind the scenes .
“ I absolutely support this government , ” he said .
Many , however , question how genuine this assertion is .
A senior western diplomat told the Guardian that Karzai has been trying for months to undercut Ghani ’s government , with the intention of bringing it down .
Should this happen , an interim government would likely take over , and Karzai would step forward to fill the vacuum as the self - styled father of the nation , the diplomat said .
Aware of Karzai ’s intentions , but keen to avoid an open clash he might not win , Ghani has in the past tolerated the former president ’s manoeuvres to a certain extent .
“
In the political game , Karzai is leagues ahead of almost everyone else here .
Frankly , he is leagues ahead of us too .
It just took us a while to figure it out , ” the same source said .
A presidential aide who regularly meets Karzai agreed .
“ Karzai knows everyone in this country .
Ghani does not , ” he said .
The former president denies he is building up opposition .
“
Meeting tribal leaders and elders from around the country is nothing new for Mr Karzai .
This is how it used to be during the last 14 years , ” said Aimal Faizi , a long - time aide .
“
It is the Afghan political culture and also his personal style , ” he said .
“
The strong bond between President Karzai and Afghan elders and leaders from all around the country can not be ignored by either side .
”
Either way , Ghani now seems to have had enough .
Last month on a trip to Kandahar , he struck back .
Kandahar is a Karzai stronghold and home to his half - brother Shah Wali Karzai , who heads the Popalzai tribe and wields considerable influence .
The former president ruled largely through patronage , building personal relations with strongmen whose excesses and corruption he is accused of ignoring .
They now stand in the way of Ghani ’s pledge to centralise power and create more transparency .
“
There are lots of warlords in Kandahar .
They are like rats , ” said Mohammad Yusuf , a member of the provincial council .
“
The Karzai government dug channels for the rats underground , brought them to government , made them officials , and today they have power .
”
According to local media , Ghani told a group of civil society members : “
From now on , there are no parallel governments in Kandahar .
”
The newly appointed governor , Humayun Azizi , was his official representative , he said .
When Ghani came to Kandahar , one of the strongest power brokers in the south , the police chief Lt Gen Abdul Raziq , made a point of leaving town .
“
What did piss off the Ghani camp was that ahead of Ghani ’s visit , people close to Karzai rang around to tribal leaders and said ‘ do n’t turn up’ , ” a western security official said .
The president ’s advisers supposedly convinced the elders to come after all , but the incident reinforced the impression that Ghani has very little wiggle room .
“
You do n’t want your former boss breathing down your neck , ” the same source said .
The conflict between Ghani and Karzai came to a head with a memorandum of understanding signed in May between the Afghan and Pakistani spy agencies and confirmed by Pakistan ’s army , to enhance intelligence cooperation .
Many Afghans saw the deal as selling out to a sworn enemy .
The deal gave Karzai a platform to launch an attack on Ghani that chimed with public opinion .
As a result , he has come to be seen by many as a protector of national sovereignty .
To reinforce this image , he keeps up a busy travel schedule to countries uncomfortable with closer Afghan - Pakistani cooperation such as India , China and Russia .
Faizi , Karzai ’s aide , said Afghans were right to protest against the memorandum , “ which is against the national interests of their country .
The protest is [ not ] against individuals but against inappropriate policies of the Afghan government .
”
Karzai may partly be fighting for his legacy .
In rooting out corruption , Ghani will inevitably target people who amassed astonishing fortunes on the former president ’s watch .
Karzai allies have been sidelined , among them the former vice - president Yunus Qanuni and the intelligence chief Rahmatullah Nabil , who opposed the memorandum with Pakistan .
That puts Karzai in an awkward position given his tacit support for Ghani during the elections .
“ Karzai feels like Ghani would n’t have gotten the presidency without him , ” said the western security official .
The infighting could have wider repercussions , said Haroon Mir , a political analyst , pointing out that Ghani needs wide political support to begin peace talks with the Taliban .
“
It ’s not good at this time to lose political support or create opportunities for political opposition to emerge , ” Mir said .
If Ghani has tried to send a message to Karzai to back off , the former president is unlikely to comply .
Aides and analysts agree that he is positioning himself as the only viable alternative to a government that so far has not delivered .
“ Karzai knows a lot of games , and one of his games is the loya jirga , ” Ghani ’s aide said , referring to the assembly that can pave the way for , among other things , a change in the constitution .
Afghan presidents can currently only serve two terms , which Karzai has already done , but if he rallies support for a loya jirga , he can mount a challenge on a whole different level .
Karzai “ is the only known political leader of Afghanistan ” , Mir said .
“
He has all the ingredients to be a national leader – many resources , political support , his own network of influential people .
If there is a crisis , he will emerge as the only national leader .

Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri"
2015-09-10,"Hamid Karzai , the former president of Afghanistan , has questioned the existence of al - Qaida , and denied that the 9/11 terror attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people were planned in Afghanistan .
On the eve of the anniversary of the 2001 attacks , Karzai , who left office last year after 12 years , used an interview with al Jazeera to express his doubt that the terrorist group led by the late Osama bin Laden was responsible for the operation which prompted the invasion of Afghanistan .
“
I do n’t know if al - Qaida existed and
I do n’t know if they exist , ” said Karzai .
“
I have not seen them and I ’ve not had any report about them , any report that would indicate that al - Qaida is operating in Afghanistan .
It is for me a myth [ … ]
For us , they do n’t exist .
” Karzai , who had a poor relationship with successive leaders in Pakistan , also claimed in the interview that Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan are “ definitely ” members of “ Pakistani militias ” .
The former politician , who was the chosen candidate of the US to take over a new administration in the wake of the collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan following the 2001 war , clashed repeatedly with Washington during his rule .
Appearing on Al Jazeera English ’s new weekly show , UpFront , Karzai declared as “ fact ” that 9/11 was not plotted in Afghanistan , despite overwhelming proof that Bin Laden and close associates such as Khaled Sheikh Mohammed organised the operation while based in camps or houses in the east and south of the country between 1999 and 2001 .
In the interview on Thursday , the former president said he had “ never come across ” al - Qaida .
When asked if he agreed that al - Qaida in Afghanistan had been behind the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington DC , Karzai replied : “ I can tell you for a fact that the operation was neither conducted from Afghanistan , nor were the Afghan people responsible for that .
” Bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attacks on several occasions , and videoed testaments of participants in the attacks were recorded in Kandahar , where the men trained in al - Qaida camps .
Bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan in 1996 , flying from Sudan where he had been living in exile since 1991 .
He was based first in hills south of the eastern city of Jalalabad before moving south to Kandahar , the spiritual and administrative headquarters of the Taliban .
Many witnesses have described Bin Laden ’s movements in Afghanistan during 2001 , while vast quantities of al - Qaida - related material was recovered from training camps across Afghanistan by journalists , soldiers and spies .
Only last month an audio tape surfaced including a segment of a speech made in Afghanistan by Bin Laden in the summer of 2001 in which he promises a significant operation in the US soon .
Al - Qaida has since been largely eclipsed by its own offshoot , the Islamic State , which has established a small but growing presence in Afghanistan .
Most analysts and security officials believe the group ’s affiliate in Afghanistan is largely composed of disaffected members of the Taliban , but Karzai dismissed any Afghan connection with the group and pointed the finger at neighbouring Pakistan .
“
[ The Islamic State ]
… has no ground [ in Afghanistan ] at all .
There is no element , there is no medium , for them to grow , or to rise , or to strengthen , ” he said .
“
Those who are working in the name of [ the Islamic State inside Afghanistan ] are definitely Pakistani militia forces , ” he added .
“
Some of them have been captured and ID cards found on them , [ … ]
And they are very well supplied .
That we know for a fact .
”
In recent months , Karzai has repeatedly been accused of attempting to undermine his successor , Ashraf Ghani , but in the interview , he ruled out an attempt to return to the Afghan presidency .
A daring and bloody operation involving US special forces and the CIA put Karzai back in Afghanistan in the last weeks of the 2001 war and then into power as a supposed consensus candidate .
As the Taliban regime crumbled , Karzai was seen as a the man of the hour .
He was the head of a major tribe , of Pashtun ethnicity like around 40 % of his compatriots , but moderate , educated and pro - western .
Educated in India , with credentials as a “ freedom fighter ” during the war against the Soviets of the 1980s , he enthused officials in Washington , Kabul and London .
But Karzai quickly proved himself independent and contrarian , not hesitating to launch vitriolic attacks on his backers when they were responsible for civilian casualties during the bitter war against insurgents in the decade that followed or criticise broad western policies .
Officials from the US , the UK , Nato and the UN all repeatedly criticised Karzai for failing to crack down on rampant corruption and the booming narcotics trade in Afghanistan .
By 2009 , according to Robert Gates , the former US defence secretary , Washington was so keen to oust the Afghan president that officials connived in delaying an Afghan presidential election and then tried to manipulate the outcome in a “ clumsy and failed putsch
” ."
2016-08-04,"International efforts to help Afghan security forces regain control of territory taken by the Taliban are doing more harm than good , the former president of Afghanistan has warned .
Hamid Karzai spoke to the Guardian after a bloody week in Helmand , as the Taliban captured large swaths of territory where hundreds of British and American soldiers died .
As militants close in on the provincial capital , Lashkar Gah , government forces have sustained heavy losses .
Afghan commanders have pleaded with the US military to intensify airstrikes .
But , Karzai said , they should not .
“
They are very wrong –
they are terribly wrong , ” he said .
“
Those who ask foreign forces to bomb Afghanistan are not representing the Afghan people or their interests .
”
The comments echo sentiments expressed by the ex - president during his 13-year tenure .
Karzai vehemently opposed US airstrikes and night raids on Afghan villages , which he thinks undermined Afghan sovereignty , along with foreign “ interference ” in Afghan politics .
“
This denial of self - determination causes a lot of frustration and anger for the Afghan people , and that helps fuel conflict , ” Karzai said .
The US disagrees that its military is making things worse – as does the current Afghan government .
Last month , Barack Obama announced his decision to leave 8,900 soldiers in the country until 2017 , further delaying a long - planned drawdown .
A recent report showed the amount of territory controlled by the Afghan government has fallen this year , dropping from 70.5 % of the country ’s districts in early 2016 to 65.6 % .
In the past week in Helmand , where 410 of the 455 killed British soldiers in Afghanistan died , Nad Ali district was almost entirely overrun , bringing the Taliban close to Lashkar Gah .
The government is almost completely absent from northern districts such as Musa Qala , Sangin and Kajaki .
But Karzai said those losses should be accepted as the consequence of Afghan forces fighting alone .
“
If we can not fight it ourselves , then we can not ask a foreign force to come take it for us , ” he said .
“ Those who take it haev more ownership than we have .
”
The former president said foreign forces should either leave Afghanistan to deal with its own internal conflict , or focus on the Taliban ’s foreign backers in Pakistan , who Karzai blames equally for Afghanistan ’s woes .
Karzai ’s relationship with the US , who originally supported him as a spearhead for post - Taliban Afghanistan , soured so much that in 2013 Karzai refused to sign a security agreement allowing foreign troops to stay in the country .
His latest remarks are also a stab at current president Ashraf Ghani who signed the security agreement as one of his first acts after taking office in 2014 , and who is nurturing a much closer relationship to US commanders .
“
I have asked the Afghan government not to ask the US for aerial bombings of our country , ” Karzai said .
“
This is chemicals thrown on the country every day .
This is killing our fields , spreading disease , and not bringing an end to the war .
”
Since his presidential retirement in 2014 , Karzai never disappeared from political life .
He remains influential , receiving throngs of visitors , including foreign ambassadors , at his central Kabul office .
Some see his vocal presence in the fringes as undermining the government .
Karzai himself denied exerting pressure on the government “ yet
” , without elaborating on what that implied .
Many think Karzai is hardly blameless himself .
Corruption is arguably the biggest ill tormenting Afghanistan , undermining its security forces and spurring public support for the Taliban .
The corruption , while bankrolled largely by the inflow of foreign funds , was allowed to flourish under Karzai , and has so far proven impossible to curtail .
But western corruption allegations are out of proportion , Karzai retorted .
Daily corruption in Afghanistan is comparable to other weak states , while large scale corruption “ is a direct result of the US approach to Afghanistan , and the way they issued contracts
” , he said .
Though Karzai emphasised that he is not “ anti - western ” , and that he is “ very , very sorry ” for British lives lost in Afghanistan , he warned that if foreign forces do n’t change approach , those soldiers may have died for nothing .
“
Nato has been here for 14 years , ” he said , adding that foreign forces are fighting for the same districts as they were when they had 150,000 troops .
“
Are we better off ?
Do we have more security ?
No .
“
It means something is wrong .
The way things are done , it has been in vain for us . ”"
2017-09-25,"The climate campaigner Naomi Klein will address the Labour party conference this year as its international guest speaker , a slot previously given to prominent international politicians including Nelson Mandela , Bill Clinton and the then Afghan president Hamid Karzai .
Klein , an award - winning journalist whose works include This Changes Everything : Capitalism vs the Climate , will also address the grassroots festival The World Transformed ( TWT ) , which is organised by Momentum .
The Canadian writer was one of Jeremy Corbyn ’s earliest international supporters , praising the Labour election campaign as a “ bold , transformative platform which has the power to reshape the political map ” .
Klein said she was “ greatly looking forward to participating in the Labour conference where British voters will see for themselves that forming a Labour government rooted in that hopeful and urgent vision is not only possible , it ’s a moral imperative ” .
She will be introduced onstage in Brighton on Tuesday by the shadow international development secretary , Kate Osamor , who said Klein had “ courage , ambition and solutions in spades ” .
“
She has dedicated her career to tackling the root causes of climate change , inequality and poverty , and has inspired a generation to see the world differently and to work together for change .
”
Corbyn said he was delighted Klein had agreed to attend the main conference .
“ Naomi is an internationally renowned author and campaigner , who has been at the forefront of championing equality , social justice and action on climate change , ” he said .
“
I look forward to hearing her insights into the upheavals in global politics and how we can make common cause to tackle the challenges of our times and build societies in the interests of the many , not the few .
”
After her speech in the conference hall , Klein will speak on a panel with Corbyn and the shadow home secretary , Diane Abbott , at TWT festival , along with Asad Rehamn , director of War on Want , the spoken word artist Shareefa Grassroots , and leftwing Greek politician Zoe Konstantopoulou , the former speaker of the Hellenic parliament ."
