1999-07-02,"The second anniversary of Hong Kong 's handover to China was marked yesterday by a sense of foreboding as lawyers and pro - democracy protesters accused Beijing of meddling in the territory 's legal system .
In a symbolic gesture , China 's vice - president , Hu Jintao , unveiled a 20 metre - high ( 65 ft ) tower on the waterfront , carved in granite to emphasise that Hong Kong 's way of life will remained unchanged .
He said the "" great socialist country "" would never waver in support of Hong Kong 's prosperity and autonomy .
The territory 's chief executive , Tung Chee - hwa , had shown "" the wisdom and capability to handle complicated situations "" .
But as Mr Hu unveiled the reunification monument , inscribed with calligraphy by President Jiang Zemin , shouts of protest echoed from a demonstration beyond police barriers .
Critics of Mr Tung believe that a decision taken last week by China 's parliament at his request has caused monumental damage to the rule of law , by reversing a judgment delivered in January by Hong Kong 's court of final appeal .
Lawyers warn of a constitutional crisis if the court in its future judgments disregards Beijing 's "" interpretation "" of a clause governing immigration to Hong Kong .
The decision by the national people 's congress ( NPC ) has sharply reduced the number of mainland children entitled to live in Hong Kong if one of their parents is a resident .
It has done so by requiring the parent to have been resident in Hong Kong before the birth .
The result , says the leader of the Democratic party , Martin Lee , has been to reduce the court to a "" court of semi - final appeal "" .
Pro -
democracy groups and the legal profession have led opposition to the decision .
Public opinion has been swayed by government statistics that suggest that the number of children eligible under the court 's ruling could reach more than 1.6 m .
The Hong Kong Journalists ' Association yesterday called this figure "" flawed and irresponsible "" .
But a new opinion poll by Hong Kong university suggests that negative feelings about Mr Tung 's government are growing .
The satisfaction rate is down to 25 % from 42 % just after the handover .
The Asian economic crisis has heightened uncertainty .
The NPC 's decision has cast doubt on the meaning of "" one country , two systems "" - the formula devised by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to guarantee that Hong Kong would retain its identity within China .
An NPC official and Hong Kong 's secretary of justice , Elsie Leung , have implied that the one country concept takes priority over a separate Hong Kong system .
Mr Hu has done his best to soothe concerns , backed by Hong Kong 's chief secretary , Anson Chan .
Chinese leaders stress that their own system will remain unchanged .
The Beijing press yesterday carried a call from Mr Jiang for Communist party members to "" adhere to socialism and communism "" .
Neither "" ism "" is much talked about in post - Mao China , but yesterday was the 78th anniversary of the party 's founding .
Observers say that despite the assumption of stability in China and Hong Kong , both are societies in transition .
An editorial in the People 's Daily praised the "" long and glorious , if somewhat tortuous , history of the party "" , but warned that there were "" deep- rooted problems ahead which we do not yet know how to tackle "" .
Mr Tung spoke yesterday of Hong Kong as a future "" metropolis of the east , embracing innovation and technology to build a bridge between China and the world "" .
But most Hong Kongers are more concerned by their immediate future ."
2001-10-29,"The man who may soon become China 's leader arrived in London yesterday at the beginning of a European tour which western governments hope will make him less of a mystery .
Hu Jintao , who is thought likely to succeed President , Jiang Zemin as communist party boss next year , heads the "" fourth generation "" of new , more liberal leaders poised to take over .
Some Chinese democrats abroad hope that Mr Hu , currently the vice - president , will shift power away from the Communist party towards the more broadly based national people 's congress .
Yet he rose to high office in Beijing after imposing martial law on Tibet and backing the suppression of the 1989 student democracy movement .
His official biography quotes him as saying : "" A good leader should encourage democracy and also be capable of taking resolute action at critical moments "" ; yet he has spoken in favour of party control of the press .
He has also been quick to endorse Mr Jiang 's new theories about updating Marxism - Leninism .
Mr Hu was sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution and began his career in the 1980s in one of China 's poorest provinces .
The late leader Deng Xiaoping spotted him as a man of ability , and he has risen fast , but there are signs of political manoeuvring by other contenders to succeed Mr Jiang at the next party congress in October next year , so his elevation is not a foregone conclusion .
Little is known about Mr Hu 's personality : the most striking revelation in his biography is that he has occasionally "" danced solo at parties "" .
His most significant recent intervention came when he spoke out in 1999 while students staged fierce protests against the US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade .
He told them , in carefully chosen words , that the government fully supported "" all protest activities that are in accordance with the law "" .
Though Mr Hu left Tibet more than a decade ago , he keeps a close eye on the situation there .
In July this year he was the only senior figure to visit the capital , Lhasa , for an official celebration of Tibet 's "" peaceful liberation "" .
Human rights groups overseas fear that China may try to capitalise on the current anti - terror crisis by taking tougher measures against alleged separatists in Tibet as well as in the Muslim region of Xinjiang .
Yesterday Mr Hu was expected to be faced with pro - Tibet demonstrators outside the Chinese embassy in London .
A visit to the capital two years ago by Mr Jiang was also marked by protests and complaints , after demonstrators were kept out of sight , that the police were too heavy - handed .
Alison Reynolds of the Free Tibet Campaign said she hoped the peaceful protests would get their message across .
"" It will be a tragedy if the peaceful Tibetans are stereotyped now .
We realise that the mood has changed , but we hope Mr Hu will listen . ""
As the new leader of the fourth generation , in the years leading up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing , he [ Mr Hu ] has the opportunity to shift policy towards Tibet , "" she added .
But Mr Hu said in July that Tibet would only prosper under the leadership of the party and "" in the embrace of the big family of the motherland "" .
Tibetans in exile with the Dalai Lama claim that Mr Hu 's speech showed his commitment to a hardline policy , and that he rules out a negotiated settlement .
Mr Hu will visit France , Germany and Spain after spending three days in Britain , where he is due to meet Tony Blair and have an audience with the Queen .
He flew in from Moscow , where he paid a polite but unrevealing visit to President Vladimir Putin ."
2001-10-30,"It is not every day that the British monarch and prime minister welcome a foreign guest who is known for ordering his troops to mow down unarmed civilians .
By the end of this week the Queen and Tony Blair will have shaken hands with the man whose reign as the Chinese Communist party boss in Tibet in the early 90s is recalled by Tibetans with fear and loathing .
He is Hu Jintao , China 's vice - president , a politburo standing committee member , and the most likely heir to Jiang Zemin , the president and party general secretary .
The police have shielded him from seeing the Tibetan protesters who are dogging his British tour .
Yesterday , Hu will have asked the prime minister to support China 's struggle against its domestic terrorists .
When the American president was asked the same two weeks ago in Shanghai , he refused .
George Bush told Jiang : "" The war against terrorism must never be an excuse to persecute minorities .
"" It would be interesting to see the briefing notes on Hu that the Foreign Office mandarins sent over to Buckingham Palace and No 10 .
They will probably stress his rapid rise - he is only 58 - towards the pinnacle of national power .
Whitehall 's China specialists will review Hu 's scanty biographical details , beginning with the "" brilliant student "" at Qinghua University , the elite school for science and technical studies where he graduated as an engineer .
Cribbing further from the party 's potted biography , Britain 's mandarins will note that Hu became the youngest member of the central committee when he was only 39 , and that at 44 he served as China 's youngest provincial secretary , in dirt - poor Guizhou .
What is striking about the Hu dossier is that it is utterly colourless .
Official biographies of China 's leaders usually recount their love of poetry , calligraphy , opera or other hobbies .
Hu is described merely as "" well accomplished culturally "" .
But then came the appointment that made Hu and stained his character so deeply : his four years as the party secretary in Tibet , the most sensitive region under Beijing 's control .
He arrived in early January 1989 , just in time to deal with two crises .
The Panchen Lama , Tibet 's second - highest religious figure after the Dalai Lama - who had been under Beijing 's control for 30 years , including almost a decade as a prisoner - had just stunned his masters .
"" The price paid by Tibet , "" he said , "" for its development over the past 30 years has been higher than its gains . ""
That wrote off the entire period of Chinese occupation .
The Panchen Lama suddenly died soon afterwards .
Hu 's second crisis came on March 5 when a small party of monks marched through the centre of Lhasa , protesting against the killing of monks who had been gunned down a year earlier .
These monks , too , were fired on .
Crowds , armed with paving stones , rioted and looted Chinese shops , and a Chinese policeman was hurled to his death from a roof .
Chinese security officers , under orders from Hu , opened fire for three days , killing somewhere between 100 and 700 Tibetans .
March 10 is the most dangerous date in the year for the Chinese in Tibet .
It is the anniversary of the day in 1959 when Tibetans rose in revolt against the occupation and the Dalai Lama fled into Indian exile .
On March 8 1989 , martial law was declared in Tibet ; on May 25 , nine days before the Tiananmen Square killings , it was proclaimed in Beijing .
For the next four years Tibet endured the greatest brutality since the Cultural Revolution of 1966 - 76 .
It is described in Hu 's official biography as his contribution to "" unity , stability and development in Tibet "" .
He is also said to have "" shared weal and woe with the two million local people "" .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
I once had a chance encounter with Hu .
Not knowing I was a journalist , he told me how much he disliked Tibet 's altitude , climate and lack of culture .
He was keeping his family in Beijing , he told me , and feared that if there were ever an uprising against the Chinese , no Tibetan would protect him .
Immediately after June 4 1989 , Hu sent a telegram to Beijing congratulating the regime for crushing the Tiananmen Square demonstration .
In 1992 , Deng Xiaoping , who had already noticed this cooperative young cadre , elevated him to the politburo 's standing committee , and is said to have told Jiang that Hu should succeed him , as party boss in 2002 or president the following year .
Hu had made his mark as a gauleiter in Tibet .
While the job had terminated the careers of his predecessors , Hu 's ruthlessness and maintenance of "" order "" , the party 's supreme priority , shot him to the heights of national power .
Nothing is more important in China than hammering "" terrorists "" in north - western Xinjiang and "" separatists "" in Tibet .
From his vantage point in the politburo , Hu has pointed out that the Xinjiang Muslims - who have occasionally exploded bombs in public places and attacked army posts , although the majority are peaceable - use religious freedom as an excuse to oppose Beijing 's authority .
As for Tibet , last March Hu warned that Beijing would "" crack down hard on separatist activities and ... while legal religious activities and interests of the religious sector will be protected , illegal activities under the cover of religion must be resolutely opposed "" .
Blair proclaims that he stands shoulder to shoulder with Bush in the global war on terrorism .
The president , however , has declined to help Beijing crush its minority peoples .
Let 's hope the prime minister did the same ."
2001-10-30,"China is entering a long season of predictions about its future and that of the Communist leadership with less than a year to go now before a crucial party congress .
The vice - president , Hu Jintao , who this week started his European tour by visiting Moscow and London , is being closely scrutinised as the man thought most likely to succeed President Jiang Zemin as party leader .
All Mr Jiang 's "" third generation "" colleagues are also supposed to stand down , leaving room for the "" fourth generation "" to move up .
( To explain the chronology at work here , Chairman Mao belonged to the first generation , Deng Xiaoping to the second and so on )
Beijing and Hong Kong are buzzing with rumours about high - level manoeuvring - too complicated to explain without a tedious glossary - that might lessen Mr Hu 's chances and perhaps allow some of the oldies to hang on .
Yet there is a general feeling that China must move into a new stage .
The prospect of the 2008 Olympics being held in Beijing seems - to the optimists - to provide a strong incentive for positive change .
China 's imminent entry to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) is also invoked by them .
Those who take a gloomier view of China 's future also argue that China is moving into uncharted territory : for them , WTO entry will cause social dislocation on a scale that outweighs narrow economic benefits .
For both camps , new international tensions sharpen the sense that a turning point has been reached .
Does the anti - terror alliance that China has joined give it leverage for a more positive relationship with the US , and a larger role on the world stage ?
Or will it reinforce authoritarian trends at home , with even tougher repression of "" separatists "" and all other forms of dissent , which will alienate the party further from public opinion ?
Predictions are by their very nature either good or bad , but never indifferent .
After all , who wants to be told that China will probably get by in the next decade , and that nothing very startling will happen either way ?
A new book called The Coming Collapse of China by Gordon Chang , published this year in the US , lies at the extreme negative end of the spectrum . ""
All the experts acknowledge that the People 's Republic faces serious challenges : "" writes Chang in a defence of his argument ( China Brief , October 25 ) , "" failing state - owned enterprises and banks , rising corruption , a deteriorating environment , a slowing economy , and growing ethnic and religious unrest ... "" .
Mr Chang alleges that "" peasants riot and workers go on the rampage , hundreds of times a day "" .
Is this not more significant , he asks , than the "" wonderful statistics "" with which the Beijing leaders invariably lace their upbeat reports ?
Now , it is true that China 's own media acknowledge thousands of conflicts every year between peasants and local officials - and increasingly between unemployed workers and local governments ( their former employers ) .
However , in many cases this can defuse tensions rather than exacerbate them , and may result in concessions being made to the protesters .
In Maoist terms , these remain more or less "" contradictions among the people "" .
Indeed , they are acknowledged officially in part because they had some success in defusing social tension .
Mr Chang is kicking into an open goal when he mocks the "" wonderful statistics "" produced routinely by Beijing - which no one in China takes seriously anyhow .
The question is whether the real statistics , if they were produced , would be so damning as critics allege .
For example , a new state council information office white paper on rural poverty claims that the number of people below the poverty line has now been reduced to 30 m - or around 3 % of the current rural population .
If true , this would mean an almost 50 % reduction in the past five years from the official figure for 1995 - 96 of 65 m rural poor ( also thought to be far too low ) .
One simple counter - statistic is enough to undermine the latest glowing claim : it is based on a definition of the poverty line - at the equivalent of a daily per capita income of less than US$ 0.66 ( £ 0.44 ) - which is unrealistically low .
A World Bank study this year (
China : Overcoming Rural Poverty ) recommends that the definition should be changed to the preferred "" international standard "" of $ 1 equivalent a day .
At a stroke this would increase the number of the chronically poor from 30 to 106 m .
We should remember , too , that these figures only refer to the rural poor : urban poverty , though harder to measure ( per capita incomes are higher , but so are living expenses ) amounts to many millions and is probably on the increase .
And yet again , even the revised figures are fairly impressive : if Beijing were content to rely on them it would still have much to be proud of .
The real reduction is in the order of around 300 m in 1990 to around 100 m a decade later .
If population increase over the same period is factored in , this is even more of an achievement .
The weak point from the point of the regime 's stability will be unemployment rather than poverty .
A careful study by the Chinese economist Hu Angang in the Rand publication China , the United States , and the Global Economy ( June 2001 ) offers a long - term prediction of the kind to make Mr Jiang 's heart swell with pride .
If China maintains the rate of development it has shown in the past 20 years , says Professor Hu , it will "" catch up with the US in terms of total GDP "" in the next two decades , and its total trade volume will only be slightly lower than that of the US .
However , Prof Hu 's forecast is predicated on China developing "" without social unrest , a split in the country , or major mistakes in important economic decisions "" .
And his figures for unemployment ( accurate up to 1998 ) show "" a record rise since the establishment of the People 's Republic of China ( 1949 ) "" to about 8 % of the urban workforce .
Prof Hu is an unashamed advocate of Chinese entry into the WTO , which he says should be seen as the international "" economic Olympics "" .
"" The world needs China and China needs the world even more .
The long - term advantages of a liberal trade system and more - transparent market competition to China 's economy will far surpass the short - term cost adjustments of open trade .
"" This statement , true or false , should be an essay subject for all predictions about China 's future .
The answer will be much more important than whatever happens to Mr Jiang or Mr Hu at the next party congress ."
2002-04-26,"As Chinese vice - president Hu Jintao arrives this weekend in the US , no one quite knows where relations between the world 's most powerful and the world 's most populous country are heading .
It should all have been plain sailing after President Bush 's summit in Beijing in February .
Mr Hu , heir apparent to President Jiang Zemin , is also supposed to prepare the way for a return summit in the autumn .
Yet Mr Hu 's visit was in the balance only last month , and there is now an unusual effort to explain why it should go ahead .
An article published by the China news service , quoting official sources , admits that the temperature of relations dropped rapidly after a string of pro - Taiwan gestures by Washington .
However , it says the visit is still justified because the US needs China and Mr Bush should be given a chance for his policy to "" mature "" .
Washington , it believes , can not stand alone and will have no choice but to seek a policy of "" equilibrium "" with Beijing .
The only problem with this argument is that President Bush does not appear to have heard of it .
The brash way in which he has thumbed his nose at Chinese sensitivities , particularly over Taiwan , has startled long - time US - China watchers .
When a year ago he promised to do "" whatever it takes "" to defend Taiwan , this could be dismissed as a Bushism .
Yet the same pledge was repeated this year , within weeks of the Beijing summit , by the hawkish deputy defence secretary , Paul Wolfowitz , at a seminar in Florida that was attended ( a further slap in the face for Beijing ) by the Taiwanese defence minister .
Wolfowitz also promised further military help for Taiwan .
US defence officials are now urging Taiwan to overhaul their military training and command so as to make the best use of the new hardware promised by Washington .
The package already on offer includes eight submarines , four air - defence destroyers and 12 Orion anti - sub patrol planes .
In the past it was Taiwan which nagged the US to deliver more : these days it seems to be the other way round .
Ever since Richard Nixon started the rapprochement between his country and China in 1972 , both sides have tried to gloss over their differences on Taiwan .
Now , as the Hong Kong - based Far Eastern Economic Review commented this week , it looks as if "" ' strategic ambiguity ' is dead "" .
Washington officials say that they simply want to clarify what has always been implicit : while the US supports the doctrine of "" One China "" it will never allow Beijing to resolve the issue by force .
Yet it is a strange time to choose for such clarification , when China in practice continues to accept Taiwan 's de facto independence and the world has more than enough crises already .
Washington can get away with it because Beijing ( and more especially Mr Jiang ) can not afford another upset in relations .
The insistence of the late president Deng Xiaoping that China "" needs stability for development "" is truer than ever now that Beijing has joined the WTO and seeks to create millions of new jobs while downsizing state industry .
The long - term strategic vision is of a 21st century in which China becomes ever stronger , as Mr Jiang has put it , through "" economic globalisation and interdependence "" .
Mr Jiang has also committed China to the US "" war on terror "" hoping to use this as leverage in the bilateral relationship .
His own forthcoming visit to Washington , before he hands over leadership of the Communist party to Mr Hu , must not be disturbed by doubts about his diplomatic wisdom .
Any hint of failure would also prejudice Mr Jiang 's hopes of continuing to wield influence after the transfer of power .
At the same time , the Beijing leadership needs to reassure itself and the Chinese people that it can still pursue an independent foreign policy .
The point was made last week during Mr Jiang 's visit to Tehran when he talked about US "" hegemonism "" - though only in the Chinese version of his speech .
Public discussion of Mr Jiang 's strategy is not encouraged .
Anti - US sentiment of the kind frequently expressed on China 's website discussion groups has to make do with surrogate targets .
The case of a young American postgraduate , accused last month of "" looking at a woman 's breasts "" on a bus in Shenzhen , has been endlessly debated .
A new controversy has now arisen over attempts by private US interests to obtain payment for bonds issued in 1913 by China 's first dictator , Yuan Shih - kai , to finance a foreign loan .
Though the bond - holders have no hope of success , their claim provides a useful peg for denunciation of those officials who "" sold out China to the imperialists "" when the Manchu dynasty collapsed .
No one is suggesting that China is being sold out again : for most people the advantages of globalisation outweigh concerns about US dominance .
Yet even Mr Jiang betrayed anxiety on Tuesday when he met the US commerce secretary , Don Evans , in Beijing and told him that Washington should create a "" good climate "" and stop causing "" avoidable problems "" .
Taiwan is not the only issue to disturb the equilibrium : a US - led war against Iraq could put even greater strain on relations .
Diplomats in close touch with US thinking say that no one is worrying now about a possible negative reaction from Beijing .
If true , that could be a serious miscalculation .
Mr Jiang , in the old Chinese phrase , is riding the US tiger because it would be dangerous to get off .
But some day there may be a nasty jolt .

2002-11-14,"Hu Jintao , the man expected to become China 's leader tomorrow , represents a new generation of senior Communist cadres who have grown up since the revolution .
His career is solid : he was educated in science and technology and rose in the political ranks via the Communist Youth League .
He is competent without ostentation , has worked in many areas of Chinese life , has a pleasant but slightly distant smile and reveals little of his personality .
The most striking disclosure so far is that he has occasionally "" danced solo at parties "" .
His official biography notes that he is a "" staunch supporter of the policies of [ economic ] reform and opening the door [ to the outside world ] "" .
It is less clear how far he is committed to China 's political transformation .
Critics of Chinese policy in Tibet point out that Mr Hu 's respectable image today needs some qualification : martial law in Lhasa was instituted under his rule as party secretary there in 1989 .
Mr Hu 's appointment in Tibet , argues a report from the UK - based Free Tibet Campaign , "" marked the beginning of the end of what had been a relatively liberal decade in the region _ "" Mr Hu 's official biography praises him for braving "" the plateau region 's hostile natural conditions including a lack of oxygen "" .
Like most Chinese officials , he seems to have regarded service in Tibet as a penance .
He was rewarded in 1992 by election at a young age to the standing committee of the ruling party politburo .
Deng Xiaoping had just kick - started the economic reforms , jolted by the 1989 trauma , back into life , and Mr Hu represented the acceptable face of the modern party .
In 1998 he was elected vice - president of the People 's Republic and later that year vice - chairman of the party 's central military commission ."
2002-11-14,"China 's senior Communist leader , Jiang Zemin , is expected to step down from power at the party congress in Beijing today after forcing a popular rival to leave the stage with him .
Li Ruihuan , the target of Mr Jiang 's manoeuvre , is the only top leader who can claim a genuine working - class background in the party today and the only significant politician who has refused to subscribe wholeheartedly to the president 's philosophy .
His departure clears the way for Mr Jiang 's chosen successor , Hu Jintao .
Delegates attending the congress confirmed yesterday that six of the seven most senior figures would not be candidates for the party 's new central committee to be chosen today , and would therefore no longer lead the party .
They include Mr Li who had been expected to stay on , unlike Mr Jiang and his other colleagues .
This week Mr Li was the only leader to acknowledge popular dissatisfaction with the party , warning that top leaders should "" never divorce themselves from the people "" .
Clearly referring to grassroots concerns about unemployment , corruption and the widening gap between rich and poor , he said that the party should not "" ignore , despise or evade these problems "" .
According to the Hong Kong commentator Willy Lam , Mr Jiang had "" worked on [ Mr Li 's ] removal because [ he ] is the only senior cadre who has refused to publicly salute Jiang Zemin theory "" .
Mr Jiang and four other leaders , including the former premier Li Peng - the man held most responsible for the 1989 Beijing massacre - were due to step down on the understanding that senior figures older than 70 should not stand for re - election .
All belong to the current seven - person standing committee - the elite core of the ruling party politburo - but can not be re - elected if they are not members of the new central committee .
At 68 , Li Ruihuan is free , in theory , to continue in high office .
It was widely believed he would replace Li Peng next year as chairman of the national people 's congress ( NPC ) - China 's parliament .
The only surviving standing committee member , the 59-year - old vice - president , Mr Hu , should now succeed Mr Jiang as party general secretary .
During the summer Mr Jiang 's supporters floated the idea that he might after all stay on as party leader in spite of the agreed age limit .
The implication was that the only way to persuade Mr Jiang to step down after all would be for everyone else to go quietly too - including Li Ruihuan .
This manoeuvre may also have overcome any temptation by the hardline Li Peng to try to hang on to power too .
Even if Li Ruihuan does now become chairman of the NPC his authority will be much reduced .
The outcome will disappoint those who hoped for a more moderate voice in charge of the parliament .
He began life as a self - educated carpenter who helped to build the Great Hall of the People where the congress is now meeting .
He caught the eye of Mao Zedong after he devised a successful way of shortening the construction time .
In the 1980s he became a popular mayor of Tianjin , joined the politburo , and was known as the darling of the national leadership .
But after the 1989 crisis he was overshadowed by Li Peng and by Mr Jiang who took the top post of general secretary .
The congress 's deliberations on choosing a new 360-strong central committee have been conducted in secrecy .
However , several delegates revealed to Reuters yesterday that none of the current standing committee leaders except Mr Hu was a candidate .
Short of an unlikely last - minute upset , this automatically makes Mr Hu the successor .
"" They are all getting old and want to make room for younger leaders to promote development , "" said one delegate .
Another commented : "" I think this is progress . ""
Mr Hu has been groomed for some time to succeed Mr Jiang and was virtually paraded as his successor during the visit of President George Bush to Beijing in February .
The new standing committee and the larger politburo are expected to contain several pro - Jiang stalwarts , including the former Shanghai party boss , Huang Ju , the controversial Beijing party boss , Jia Qinglin , and the vice premier , Wu Bangguo .
The session tomorrow will reveal too whether Mr Jiang is to step down from his position as chairman of the party 's military commission which controls the armed forces .
He will not resign as president until the next national people 's congress in March when Mr Hu is also expected to take over Mr Jiang 's state role .
None of the politicking of the last few months has been discussed , even in the most circuitous terms , anywhere in the Chinese media .
"" We can publish quite a lot these days , "" said one Beijing journalist , "" but we know we must stay clear of leadership politics . """
2002-11-15,"Hu Jintao , vice - president of China since 1998 , was today appointed general secretary of the Communist party , in a widely expected move that clears the way for him to assume full power when Jiang Zemin stands down as Chinese president at the national people 's congress in March .
In line with plans laid by the late Deng Xiaoping , the party 's 16th congress today ended its week - long session by confirming the retirement of six out of the seven former top leaders , including the former general secretary , Jiang .
As the only surviving standing committee member , Hu 's appointment was inevitable .
At 59 , Jiang 's chosen successor is a member of the "" fourth generation "" - one of the senior Communist party cadres to have grown up after the revolution .
But the relative youthfulness of China 's leader - in - waiting is unlikely to presage any break with Communist party policy .
According to Hu 's official biography , he is a "" staunch supporter of the policies of [ economic ] reform and opening the door [ to the outside world ] "" .
In fact Hu is the perfect , colourless candidate for such a clearly stage - managed handover of power .
Few people know much about Hu 's personality , aside from what can be gleaned from his rapid rise through the party ranks .
Educated at Qinghua University , the elite school for science and technical studies where he graduated as an engineer , Hu rose in the political ranks via the Communist Youth League .
He became the youngest member of the central committee when he was only 39 , and at 44 he served in Guizhou as China 's youngest provincial secretary .
In 1989 Hu became party secretary in Tibet , the most sensitive region in China .
The post is regarded by most as a poisoned chalice , but proved to be the making of Hu .
During his four - year tenure , he upheld the rule of Beijing with a ruthlessness that clearly impressed Deng , the then president - starting with the extremely bloody suppression of an uprising in Lhasa , in March 1989 .
Under orders from Hu , Chinese security forces opened fire for three days , killing somewhere between 100 and 700 Tibetans .
After the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989 , Hu sent a congratulatory telegram to Deng .
His reward came in 1992 , with his promotion to the politburo 's standing committee .
Deng is said to have told Jiang that Hu should succeed him , as party boss in 2002 or president the following year .
In 1998 he was elected vice - president of the People 's Republic and later that year vice - chairman of the party 's central military commission .
In a visit to the UK last October Hu met the British prime minister , Tony Blair , had an audience with the Queen - and was heckled by demonstrators from the Free Tibet Campaign .
During President Bush 's bridge - building visit to Beijing in February , Hu was virtually paraded as Jiang 's successor .
However Hu has some way to go before his grip is complete - despite clearly grooming him as his successor , Jiang , 76 , has lately appeared slightly reluctant to relinquish power .
He retains the leadership of the powerful military commission and has ensured that the standing committee of the politburo - expanded for the first time from seven to nine members - is packed with staunch allies to ensure his influence over policymaking as China struggles on with economic reform ."
2002-11-15,"Vice - President Hu Jintao was today appointed as leader of China 's Communist party , handing him the country 's most powerful position and making him a certain bet to replace Jiang Zemin as president next year .
His appointment as general secretary positions Mr Hu atop a new generation of leaders who will guide China through sweeping changes and economic reforms launched by Deng Xiaoping and his successor , Mr Jiang .
The new leaders emerged from behind a carved wooden and lacquer screen in the Soviet - style Great Hall of the People in central Beijing . ""
On behalf of all members of the newly - elected central leadership , I thank all comrades of the party for their trust , "" said Mr Hu as China 's new leaders faced the world 's media for the first time .
Minutes after his appointment was confirmed , the government said Mr Jiang had been re - elected to head China 's powerful military commission , which ensures he will retain formal influence in the affairs of the nation .
"" We will live up to the great trust of the entire party and the expectations of people across the country , "" Mr Hu , 59 , said .
He said all China 's people and ethnic groups must unite to develop the economy and modernise the nation .
Mr Hu credited Mr Jiang for laying the groundwork for his leadership and the party 's future .
"" We firmly believe China 's tomorrow will surely be better , "" Mr Hu said , grinning broadly as he waved at reporters .
The introduction was broadcast live on state television and immediately followed by music and communist utopian imagery .
The party posts are the true power of China 's government .
Although the president is the head of state in China , his power is derived from his party position .
Mr Jiang held both posts since he was named president in 1993 .
After the brutal and unpredictable power politics of the Mao Zedong era , the chaotic Cultural Revolution , and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre , this transition is the first orderly one since the communists took power in 1949 .
The eight other newly named members of the inner - sanctum politburo standing committee include top officials Luo Gan and Wen Jiabao .
Mr Wen , now vice - premier , is expected to replace the reform - minded premier , Zhu Rongji , who is also retiring .
Mr Luo , the architect of China 's law - enforcement policies , is considered a hardline leader who is spearheading a campaign to tighten control of the internet .
Just minutes after officially stepping down as party leader , Mr Jiang was re - elected to head China 's powerful military commission that oversees the People 's Liberation Army .
Mr Jiang remains president until March .
Mr Hu is a sure bet to take over that post at the national people 's congress , China 's legislature .
But Mr Jiang , 76 , has installed allies on the standing committee and is expected to exert great influence .
Mr Hu inherits a nation brimming with foreign investment but plagued by the problems of transforming a planned economy into the capitalistic "" socialist market economy "" that Mr Jiang , like Mr Deng before him , has encouraged .
Eastern cities are booming , while inland regions remain poor and undeveloped .
Some 26 million have been thrown out of work since 1998 in the attempt to privatise or clean up state - owned industries .
Corruption remains rampant , despite party promises to rein it in .
And while the country is , economically , more liberal than ever , politically it remains a virtual police state .
The transition was conducted in a Byzantine , secrecy - cloaked manner at odds with China 's claims to be flinging open its doors to the outside world .
The new leaders replace a slate of retiring politicians who , with one exception , are in their 70s .
Until recently that would have been young for communist politicians .
But the party is seeking to build an image of vitality and progress .
Other top figures bowing out include Li Peng , head of the legislature and a key figure in the crackdown on pro - democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989 , and the reformist Mr Zhu .
Both are in their 70s .
An engineer by trade , Mr Hu oversaw China 's Tibet policy for years .
He has maintained a very low profile in Chinese politics until recent months .
In 1992 , Mr Hu was elevated to the party 's politburo and at about the same time was picked by Mr Deng to succeed Mr Jiang .
He was made vice - president in 1998 and has also been Mr Jiang 's deputy on powerful commissions that control China 's army .
Outside the Great Hall today , security agents walked up every time a foreigner spoke to Chinese walking by .
Nearby , in one of Beijing 's narrow alleyways , news of Mr Hu 's appointment spread by word of mouth .
"" I wish he would fix the corruption problem , but I do n't have much hope , "" said a laid - off chemical - plant worker .
"" We do n't know if he 's clean , like Zhu Rongji , or not . ""
"" We do n't know anything about him , "" said a man selling baked sweet potatoes from the back of a handcart in Beijing .
"" It should be no big change .
I do n't see a difference . """
2002-11-16,"President Jiang Zemin surrendered leadership of the Communist party to his deputy , Hu Jintao , yesterday but he retains a tight grip on the back of the throne .
In a ceremony broadcast live on every national television channel , a smiling Mr Hu introduced the country to the nine - strong politburo standing committee which he will lead as party secretary .
Within minutes of him doing so , it was announced that Mr Jiang will remain head of the party 's military commission ; a pointed reminder that Mr Hu 's boss is still ultimately in charge .
Against a pictorial backcloth of majestic mountains in the Great Hall of the People , Mr Hu led his new team before the world 's press , waving confidently before introducing them one by one .
It was a line - up which includes six men closely linked to Mr Jiang .
Some Sinologists believe it is sensible for Mr Hu to have Mr Jiang 's prestige behind him as he seeks to establish his own authority , but only if Mr Jiang does not stay on the scene for too long .
Mr Hu made a point of explaining that the new guiding principle for the party 's work would be Mr Jiang 's doctrine that the party should be more inclusive and satisfy the material needs of all the people .
This "" important thinking "" , he said , would be "" the guiding philosophy that our party will adhere to for a long time to come "" and had set the "" [ future ] direction for our endeavour "" .
He also praised Mr Jiang 's report to the congress , which ended on Thursday , for setting out goals for the next 20 years .
Mr Hu did not refer to the problems facing China , such as the unemployment preoccupying many , nor did he suggest the party might have failed to deliver in the past .
"" We are convinced that ... the Chinese Communist party will further project its fine image before the world as a party that advances with the times in a pioneering spirit , "" he said .
The new leadership group includes Mr Jiang 's closest adviser , Zeng Qinghong , who will occupy the pivotal role of head of the party 's secretariat , from which he can determine appointments and all daily business .
Also as expected , two other senior figures will be the vice - premier , Wu Bangguo , and Wen Jiabao , who share responsibility for economic policy .
More controversial is the inclusion of the Beijing party boss and former governor of Fujian province , Jia Qinglin , who has been tarnished by a huge smuggling scandal .
Huang Ju , until recently the party boss of Shanghai ( Mr Jiang 's own political base ) , has risen rapidly to the standing committee , the politburo 's inner core .
Mr Huang looked extremely pleased with himself yesterday .
He was joined by Li Changchun , a colleague from Guangdong who is also a Jiang loyalist .
The biggest surprise was the inclusion of Wu Guanzheng from Shandong , who is to helm the party 's anti - corruption committee .
This left Luo Gan , who was expected to get the anti - corruption job , as No 9 , outranked by all the others .
Mr Hu referred to him as their "" elder brother "" , but that will not have softened the blow .
Mr Luo played a dubious role in the suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 , and is close to the former premier Li Peng , who was widely seen as the chief villain of the crackdown .
Mr Jiang appears to have dealt a blow to his main rivals .
Having forced the liberal Li Ruihuan - expected to remain on the standing committee - to resign alongside him , he has also now marginalised Li Peng , his main conservative rival .
To carry out the manoeuvre , the committee has been expanded from seven to nine .
The full politburo of 24 contains several others members of Mr Jiang 's clique who are based mainly in central or southern China , specifically Shanghai .
The only woman on the politburo is Wu Yi , a former foreign trade minister .
Despite conventional Chinese wisdom that "" they hold up half the sky "" there are only four women full members of the central committee , and 194 men ."
2002-11-16,""" Of course , Jiang Zemin will stay in charge of the armed forces , "" said the man in a leather jacket on the Avenue of Everlasting Peace . ""
He will have to keep an eye on Hu Jintao . ""
Did n't Chairman Mao say that power grows out of the barrel of a gun ?
If Hu makes a mess of things , Jiang will simply pull him down again . ""
Whether it is true or false , this is not the sort of political speculation to be found in the Chinese media .
Every newspaper and television station was unfailingly flattering yesterday about Mr Jiang who has resigned as general secretary but stayed on as chairman of the military commission .
On the avenue , inside a glass propaganda showcase near Tiananmen Square , lay the frontpage headline of the Beijing Youth Daily .
It read : "" Triumphant conclusion to the 16th Communist Party Congress . ""
By a strange coincidence the tabloid Beijing Xinbao ran the same headline , too , though with fewer Chinese characters .
The man in the leather jacket spoke like a typical Beijinger , one who knows his mind .
He would have said more but two policemen approached and I retreated quickly .
I hope he convinced them that I was just a stupid foreigner .
The official line yesterday was that the leadership has handed over power to the next generation , and that Mr Jiang 's "" important thinking "" will guide China 's future .
Others on the avenue were quite positive about the generational shift . ""
Hu is all right , "" said a man in a newspaper kiosk .
"" He 's younger and he has got more strength . ""
The newsagent raised both arms with clenched fists to emphasise the point .
But there is much less certainty about whether the party can tackle the problems ahead .
Long - time city residents are more likely than those from the countryside to approve of an economic strategy which has boosted urban development across China but has widened the gap between rich and poor .
In the Xinhua Bookshop on the main shopping street of Wangfujing , several people were browsing at a display of books about the party 's history and policies .
Most people in China know more about politics than they are sometimes given credit for .
At least having only one party to follow makes it simpler .
A young man picked up a volume with a hammer and sickle on its cover .
He pointed at the sickle : "" I think our government has forgotten about the peasants , "" he commented .
"" They are only interested in the hammer now . ""
Not surprisingly , he came from a peasant family himself .
By dint of hard study he had migrated from north - west China to work in a Beijing advertising agency .
"" I can be a good son now and send back money to my parents , "" he explained .
"" They could n't manage otherwise : life is too poor in our village . "" While politics is immune from media criticism , some interesting comments on the economy are easier to find .
The 21st Century Business Herald published a sharp criticism yesterday of the government 's failure to reform state industries .
There were still too many state - owned companies - more than 46,000 - operating in 39 different branches of the economy , an economist on the comment pages said .
The Economic Observer ran a commentary tracing China 's efforts to modernise back over the last 150 years and warned that it is still a long and tortuous path ."
2002-11-16,"Yesterday China 's new Communist party general secretary Hu Jintao said that his team would have to "" live up to the expectations of the people throughout the country "" .
After a week of a party congress in Beijing in which the leadership has expressed unremitting self - satisfaction , it is indeed time to ask what the people of China expect of it .
The party elite has satisfied one minimum requirement - that there should be no unnerving political lurches at the top .
If ordinary Chinese can not vote their leaders in or out , at least they expect them to behave sensibly .
In this respect , it may be no bad thing that President Jiang Zemin remains so visibly on the scene , with his appointees dominating the new Politburo while he continues to head the party 's military commission .
His doctrine of the Three Represents , however overblown , is a commitment to put the people 's well - being first and to make the party more inclusive .
The outside world should also approve : Mr Jiang has had a moderating effect on Chinese foreign policy towards the US ( even under provocation ) and over Taiwan .
The decline in the fortunes of Li Peng , the Butcher of Beijing , whose man on the standing committee has been placed at the bottom of the list , is also good news .
Is it too much to hope for at least a tacit shift towards a more humane perspective on the past ?
For most Chinese , what matters most is evidence that the party , if it is to claim the divine right to rule , should not only continue to deliver economic growth but should be less corrupt in doing so , more aware of the negative effects of growth and more responsive to public opinion .
There is a more general admission now that the progress of the past 20 years has been flawed - deeply so - by corruption , unemployment , and the widening gap between rich and poor , and between town and countryside .
Other serious problems such as the country 's looming HIV - Aids crisis and the wrecking of China 's environment are beginning to be tackled .
Yet good intentions too often are blocked by a combination of incompetence and vested interests at the local party level .
Some analysts are saying that radical initiatives can only be expected later - say after the next congress in five years ' time when the new general secretary has settled in .
But China can not wait that long .
If Mr Hu wants to live up to expectations , he needs to start now ."
2002-11-17,"The day after China was promised a new approach for the twenty - first century , it was back to the old political style as the entire Communist press published the same photographs of the nation 's new leaders in the same order and in the same place on every front page .
Top - right was a large picture of the new party boss Hu Jintao next to his mentor , President Jiang Zemin , who supposedly stepped down from power last week at the party 's Sixteenth Congress in Beijing .
Both men featured again in separate pictures below , followed by those of the eight members of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee , which was chosen on Friday .
The papers ' layout conveyed the not - so - subtle message that Jiang is still very much on the scene .
The old art of Pekinology - which used to guess changes in the leadership from the arrangement of newspaper pictures - has a new lease of life .
Publication of yesterday 's Beijing newspapers was delayed until mid - morning , probably to ensure that the uniformity was observed .
On Friday Hu had led out his new team before the world press , introducing them in the order of precedence followed so scrupulously with the pictures .
With dark suits and red ties , each stood on his allotted floor stud in the Great Hall of the People while Hu said that China would embark on a new ' action plan ... for the new century ' .
The moment the meeting was over , however , the Xinhua national news agency rushed out an urgent one - line dispatch : Jiang , it said , would remain as chairman of the party 's military commission .
Yesterday another picture showed him addressing top military leaders and wearing an army tunic .
It was a heavy hint that the former party general secretary has no intention of fading away quietly .
Jiang 's ' important thinking - as Hu deferentially described it to the nation on Friday - is now the ideology for a new age .
His doctrine of the Three Represents is now being listed ahead of the ideas of Marx and Lenin .
It says the party should represent ' the basic interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people ' - not just the working class .
Yesterday an editorial in the official People 's Daily praised the ' smooth succession ' from the ' third generation ' of those who remember the revolution ( Jiang is 76 ) to a new group of ' energetic leaders ' ( Hu is 59 ) .
It flattered the party elders for their ' nobility of character ' in stepping down , though it appears Jiang has not done so as completely as the others .
Many Chinese , used to the tradition of deferring to their elders until they die , accept that this is natural . '
Mr Hu has a good background , ' said a Beijing worker , ' but he still needs Jiang to back him up . '
They approve too of Jiang 's emphasis on the need to deliver the material goods to the Chinese people , although some worry that this seems to favour the rich .
In a significant revision of traditional doctrine Jiang has opened the door to private entrepreneurs joining the party . '
We say everyone should be rewarded according to their work , ' explains one senior journalist . '
It does not matter now whether the work is manual or mental , or whether it is the result of investing one 's capital . '
Not everyone agrees with the virtual reintroduction of capitalism . '
If we deny that exploitation of others still exists , ' one critic complained on a popular website yesterday , ' we are blindfolding ourselves while we walk on a mountain path ' .
Jiang is expected to hand over his concurrent position as President to Hu at the next meeting of the National People 's Congress , the country 's parliament , in March .
China experts are divided on how long he will be able to maintain effective power by remaining as head of the military commission .
If his influence fades in the next two years , it will be a sign that Chinese politics really is changing .
Jiang threatened to stay on as party boss as recently as last July - a manoeuvre which forced his rivals in the leadership to resign - and he clearly believes that the nation still needs him .
Whatever worries other Chinese may have about the party and particularly its failure to root out corruption , 103-year - old Zhang Chuntai in the north - eastern city of Shenyang has no doubts .
He has just applied to join the party , says the People 's Daily , because it has created a ' decent life ' for China .
When it turns cold , he says , the city leaders visit his house to see whether the central heating is working properly .
Jiang would be proud of Zhang , for whom age is also no obstacle ."
2003-01-04,"The general secretary of the Chinese communist party , Hu Jintao , has made a keynote speech urging the party 's 65 million members to live a simple life and avoid the temptations of money , power and sex .
The speech by China 's leader - in - waiting was splashed on the front pages of all the main Chinese newspapers yesterday .
Analysts said it was aimed at reviving the image of a party tarnished by high - level corruption scandals - and at reassuring party stalwarts that they should not feel threatened by recent moves to embrace private entrepreneurs .
In his speech , Mr Hu urged cadres to embrace "" the fine style of simple living and hard work , and endeavour to realise the grand goal of building a well - off society in an all - round way "" . ""
Whether every party member , especially leading cadres , can resist the temptations of power , money , beauty and sex is a practical test , "" Mr Hu said .
The speech was delivered on December 6 , but excerpts were only published yesterday .
The newspapers gave no reason for the delay in publishing Mr Hu 's first major policy address since he succeeded Mr Jiang as general secretary .
The handover happened at the 16th party congress in November and was China 's first orderly succession since 1949 .
Mr Hu is expected to be elected president at the annual session of parliament in March .
Mr Hu , virtually surrounded by Mr Jiang 's allies in the new party leadership , made his remarks during a visit to the northern province of Hebei , the site of Mao Zedong 's last revolutionary base before he swept to power in 1949 .
In the speech , Mr Hu invoked Mao 's name 16 times , quoting the late communist party chairman extensively .
That compared with just five mentions for Mr Jiang .
"" The roads we must walk are still long .
The responsibilities we must shoulder are still heavy , "" he said .
"" The difficulties and challenges we may face are still many .
We must be humble , prudent , live a simple life and work hard from start to end .
"" Some analysts linked Mr Hu 's comments on frugality with the landmark decision at the November congress to admit entrepreneurs to the party . ""
Hu Jintao was trying assure hardliners that the communist party has not become a capitalist party , "" said Kou Chien - wen , a China watcher at the Institute of International Relations in Taiwan .
Mr Hu 's attack on corruption is also thought to be an attempt to assert himself and stake his claim to be the leader of China 's next generation .
Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists took power in 1949 , but the scourge began to return after economic reforms in the late 1970s .
"" This is a huge political priority for the party , "" a western diplomat said .
"" Its own legitimacy is sapped a great deal in the eyes of the Chinese public via the endemic corruption in this country . """
2003-01-21,"The plight of migrant workers who are unable to return home for the Chinese new year because their wages have not been paid is being addressed by the Chinese government following years of neglect .
In Beijing , where the unpaid wage bill amounts to 220 m yuan ( £ 16.5 m ) , a new law will take building licences away from all construction firms failing to pay their workers .
The campaign reflects both a more caring official attitude and growing concern over the widening gap between rich and poor , and seems strongly connected with the rise Hu Jintao , who was appointed leader of the Communist party in November .
Mr Hu soon called a meeting of the party 's ruling standing committee , to discuss urban and rural poverty , following a well - publicised visit to a revolutionary base in the countryside .
Since then , he has travelled to rural Inner Mongolia , a province rarely visited by national leaders , where television pictures showed him meeting poor herdsmen and farmers .
China 's vice - premier , Wen Jiabao has been touring under - privileged areas in the northern inland province of Shanxi .
He is expected to become the country 's new premier at the National People 's Congress in March , when Mr Hu will also become state president .
During two visits in the space of ten days , Mr Wen visited poverty - stricken families in the villages and spoke to disadvantaged coal miners at one of the area 's biggest mines .
When told about the problems facing migrant peasants whose wages had been "" defaulted or embezzled "" , Mr Wen called for "" instant steps to stop such irregularities and defend [ their ] legitimate rights and interests "" .
Many sub - contractors of migrant labour fail to deliver the full wages promised , often claiming that they have been short - changed by larger construction companies .
In several well - publicised cases , desperate migrant workers have threatened to throw themselves off buildings unless they are paid the money owed .
Although beginning to deal with such grievances more directly , the leadership still seems keen to clamp down on more organised industrial dissent .
Last week , in the northeast city of Liaoyang , where large - scale protests alarmed China 's rulers last year , labour activists Yao Fuxin and Xiao Yunliang were tried for alleged crimes , including the serious charge of subversion .
Mr Hu 's new emphasis on China 's neglected grassroots may help him to escape from the shadow of his predecessor as Communist party leader , Jiang Zemin , who is determined to remain on the country 's political scene .
Mr Jiang has been closely associated with the surge in market forces that has enriched tens of millions of Chinese , especially those in coastal areas , but has also seen corruption increase and widened the divide between rich and poor to an alarming level .
In a speech made during his visit to the revolutionary base of Xibaibo on December 6 but only reported in full this month , Mr Hu revived Mao Zedong 's call for "" plain living and hard struggle "" .
Mao was speaking on the eve of the Chinese communist victory in 1949 , when party revolutionaries were about to be exposed to the temptations of peacetime in an urban China which most of them hardly knew .
Mr Hu is addressing a new generation of party members , including a growing number of private businessmen , in a new era of urban prosperity which encompasses what he described as the attractions of "" power , money and beautiful women "" .
Mr Jiang is identified with the goal of achieving a "" reasonably well - off "" society in China within the next 20 years , and has claimed credit for many of the nation 's hi - tech achievements .
In contrast , Mr Hu has declared that "" if the benefits of a well - off society can not be attained by rural people , China will fail to live up to its dream "" .
Mr Hu 's background inclines him to pay more attention to China 's disadvantaged millions : the most formative years of his career , the early 80s and 90s , were spent in Guizhou , Gansu and Tibet - all at or near the bottom of China 's provincial wealth table .
He hails from the central province of Anhui , which is only now beginning to emerge from poverty .
Two weeks ago , a pro - Beijing Hong Kong newspaper reported that Mr Hu had personally intervened to calm the anger of student demonstrators in Hefei , the provincial capital of Anhui , who were protesting over the death of a student in a traffic accident .
He is said to have insisted that the driver responsible should be punished and students ' demand for better safety precautions met .
If the story is true , it provides another example of his quest for a more popular touch .
However , the new emphasis on poverty reduction is not unexpected .
Senior Chinese officials , including current premier Zhu Rongji , have already deplored the gulf between rich and poor .
Academic studies highlight the problems facing a rural society in which the profits of agriculture are often swallowed up by taxation , leaving peasants with enough food to eat but little or no cash income .
China 's leaders know that a downturn in the global economy would impact first upon the estimated 80 million migrant workers whose remittances home prevent more serious rural unrest .
The emphasis , under Mr Jiang , has already shifted away from the coastal east to developing the inland west , although the focus has been mainly on large infrastructural projects which will not bring immediate benefits to the poor .
Chinese commentators are increasingly noting that the country 's problems are not automatically solved by economic growth , something that was widely assumed during the 80s when Beijing cut education , health and other budgets while pumping money into development .
New schemes designed to create more jobs for laid - off urban workers and ensure that agricultural subsidies go directly to farmers are now being discussed , and the government has also announced that any future increases in education and health budgets should be targeted mainly at rural areas .
The Chinese new year is traditionally a time during which political leaders pay comfort visits to those who work hard but are poorly paid .
Such visits are often derided as meaningless , but Mr Hu seems likely to impress people with his sincerity . ""
Comrade Jintao 's call for plain living and hard struggle is just what our party needs , "" says one member on a website discussion group run by the Communist party 's own People 's Daily .
"" We should hear more about it ! """
2003-02-21,"The general secretary of the Chinese Communist party , Hu Jintao , has called on party officials to root out corruption as further details have come to light of pervasive graft .
Mr Hu told party officials at a conference in Beijing that the fight against corruption must be carried on "" right now and for some time to come "" .
He called for "" punitive action "" against offenders while admitting that corruption was serious "" among leading cadres "" .
New instructions from the party 's disciplinary commission will ban officials from dabbling in property deals or other business transactions "" for personal or family gain "" .
Executives from China 's state - owned firms will also be prevented from "" using their power to gain benefits for themselves or their relatives "" , the conference was told .
Party officials were urged to "" fight harder against corruption this year . ""
The report coincides with a number of anecdotes about the extent of corruption which is said to be so commonplace that some children ask their parents to "" send gifts to their teachers "" so that they can earn merit points at school .
A teacher has complained to the official People 's Daily that before student elections in his school , pupils "" even invite classmates to dinner so as to get their votes "" .
He said if they become class leaders "" they may abuse their power to obtain gifts from their classmates "" .
Widespread gift - taking has also been revealed in the north - eastern province of Jilin , where a senior official has been found guilty of collecting 1.4 m yuan ( £ 106,000 ) from more than 100 of his subordinates .
Li Tiecheng , the party secretary of Jingyu county , specialised in collecting "" gifts "" in return for official transfers and promotions .
Anyone who failed to give him a present was likely to be shunted into a dead - end job .
Mr Hu has identified himself with popular concerns since he was elected party leader last November .
He will take over as state president at next month 's National People 's Congress .
He has spoken out previously on the widening gap between rich and poor and has visited poorer areas in the countryside in two well - publicised visits ."
2003-03-16,"China 's parliament elected a new president yesterday from the choice of one offered by the Communist Party - but it delivered a slap to his predecessor who is refusing to go quietly .
The National People 's Congress ( NPC ) endorsed the appointment of 60-year - old Hu Jintao as expected .
All but four of the delegates voted for him , signalling approval for his quiet , pro - reform approach to China 's future .
His election was sealed by the outgoing president Jiang Zemin in a ' warm handshake ' hailed by the media .
Jiang was beaming broadly while Hu smiled a little tightly .
Jiang has hung on to his other state position as head of the central military commission - although on past precedent this should also have gone to Hu .
NPC delegates have only one way of showing unhappiness when faced with a ballot paper bearing only one name .
In contrast to the overwhelming vote for Hu as president , 220 out of the 2,950 delegates - 7.4 per cent of the total - either abstained or voted against Jiang 's military post .
Although the vote is secret , such a gesture indicates considerable unhappiness among the hand - picked delegates .
The snub to Jiang is the strongest delivered against any national leader in the past decade except for former NPC head Li Peng - widely known as the ' butcher of the Beijing massacre ' .
Jiang first indicated he wanted to hang on to power at the Communist Party congress last November when he remained head of the party 's military committee .
In a country where the military still holds considerable influence - it has the largest number of delegates to the NPC - the symbolism is obvious .
The new vice - president , Zeng Qinghong , a close ally of Jiang , did even worse yesterday : he failed to win the support of 12 per cent of the delegates .
Since becoming party head in November , Hu has moved skilfully to indicate that he will pursue a different agenda - without saying anything to provoke Jiang .
Hu and the incoming new premier Wen Jiabao both started their careers in the poor inland provinces , and have paid well - publicised visits to deprived rural areas to show their concern .
Hu has revived the slogan of ' plain living and hard struggle ' which had been barely heard since the era of Chairman Mao .
It is now acceptable to speak in much stronger language about the problems of China 's 500 million peasants , many of whom only survive on the remittances sent home by migrant workers .
Congress delegates have also denounced unemployment and China 's appalling record of industrial accidents in stronger terms than before .
Analysts are divided on whether the Hu - Wen team will be able to reverse the widening divide between rich and poor , given the huge advantages of wealth and foreign investment already enjoyed by the booming urban sector .
In an event not known for fun and games , Jiang voted first for the cameras yesterday , followed dutifully by the rest of the leadership in order of political importance , and then by the rest of the delegates .
However , two voters took advantage of a write - in provision to make their own quiet comment on the proceedings : they filled in the name of Zhao Benshan , a TV comedian whose latest film is called Happy Times .
Wen will formally be elected today to succeed premier Zhu Rongji , who has been less successful in tackling social inequality than in promoting an annual GDP growth of 7 per cent ."

2003-05-28,"The new president of China , Hu Jintao , has joined President Vladimir Putin of Russia in a call for a "" multipolar world "" while condemning "" the use of force "" , as he begins a foreign tour designed to revitalise Chinese diplomacy .
After a week in Russia Mr Hu will attend the G8 conference in France , where China has been given observer status for the first time .
The two presidents are trying to establish a better Sino - Russian understanding which will offset , if not counterbalance , the predominance of the US in the post - Iraqi - war world .
Meeting in Moscow yesterday , they said that they stood for "" a multipolar , just and democratic world order "" on the basis of international law .
In another thrust at US unilateralism , they called for a peaceful solution on the Korean peninsula , saying scenarios "" of forceful pressure or use of force are unacceptable "" .
They also said that the UN should be given the "" central role "" in Iraq 's reconstruction .
Significantly , before he left home Mr Hu called for more military modernisation of China .
His senior military advisers appear to have been impressed - and shocked - by the White House 's pre - emptive strategy , and now believe that China must do more to hold its own .
But Chinese diplomacy is still based on seeking good relations with the US , at least in the medium term , and its criticism of the occupation of Iraq has been muted ."
2003-10-10,"These are disorientating , exhilarating , worrying times for Chinese newspapers and magazines , buffeted by the sharply changing winds of the government 's media policy as they try to keep pace with one of the world 's fastest changing nations .
Almost exclusively state - controlled , the media are being told to prepare for the day when the market rules their output .
To push them in this direction , the new government of President Hu Jintao recently issued an edict against the compulsory subscriptions that previously provided their main source of income .
Even the People 's Daily - the mouthpiece of the Communist party - appears to be feeling the pinch .
In an editorial on Wednesday , the paper spoke out against "" excessive government regulation "" and declared subscriptions to its organ to be "" a duty of party leaders and organisations "" .
This followed the government 's move to shut down any publication that earns less than half of its revenue through voluntary subscriptions and newsstand sales .
Given the turgid content of the People 's Daily , it would not survive for a day if it were exposed to true competition .
In the quest for journalistic reform , police have arrested more than a dozen reporters for accepting bribes to hush up scandals .
Even so , media freedom remains a long , long way off : editors who dare to cover controversial stories that might embarrass the Communist party risk imprisonment and the closure of their publications .
So it was perhaps not surprising this week that newspapers either completely ignored or quietly downplayed the two stories that would surely have made the biggest splash if the media had the liberty to pick their own agenda .
This weekend , the Communist party leadership will hold its most important meeting since Hu Jintao took power in March .
They will draft the first revisions to the country 's constitution for four years , possibly opening the way for a limited form of inner - party democracy .
Yet barely a word of this has been mentioned in the Chinese media .
Once the meeting is finished , China plans to become only the third nation in the world to put a man in space .
With less than a week until the expected launch , coverage has been curiously low - key , thanks to official pressure not to raise expectations until the Shenzhou ( divine vessel ) returns to earth .
The Xinhua news agency carried a short government statement that preparations are proceeding smoothly ; the Hong Kong - based Phoenix news channel dared to report the scheduled blast - off date ( October 15 ) ; and the Shanghai - based Liberation Daily even got inside the launch site - though they did n't say what it was like .
The only real detail to emerge appeared on the China.com website , which scooped its rivals in reporting that the mission would see the first genuine Chinese meal to be eaten in space : shredded pork with garlic sauce and kungpao chicken washed down with green tea .
In the absence of these two huge stories , China 's newspapers have filled their front pages with feel - good stories about the recently passed week - long holiday to celebrate the 1949 foundation of the communist nation .
The Beijing Youth Daily - which has the biggest circulation in the capital - and its nearest rival , the Beijing Times , carried big pictures of smiling shoppers and newlyweds with stories describing a nation enjoyed its new wealth .
According to the Youth Daily , 23 supermarkets surveyed in Beijing posted sales of 80 m yuan ( £ 6 m ) , an increase of 70 % from the last October 1 holiday .
There were also bigger traffic jams as more people can afford cars .
The Beijing Times reported that the price of a family car has now dropped to 30,000 yuan ( £ 2,000 ) .
As usual , most papers also found plenty of space to attack Japan .
Three of Beijing 's main papers - the Youth Daily , the Times and the Beijing Daily - carried news of a protest in Tokyo against the damage and death caused by chemical weapons left over from the second world war .
The News Weekly magazine also ran an editorial denouncing the behaviour of its neighbour 's tourists - a reference to the alleged orgy by 400 Japanese who cavorted for two nights with prostitutes at a luxury hotel in southern China .
"" The action of the Japanese aroused great public indignation in China , "" ran the leader .
"" It is a modern - day equivalent of the old game played by Japanese soldiers who competed with one another to see how many Chinese people they could decapitate . """
2003-10-20,"China 's president , Hu Jintao , yesterday rejected a personal appeal from his American counterpart , George Bush , to revalue his country 's currency and adjust other policies that Washington claims give China an unfair trading advantage .
Mr Hu declined to discuss the issue after the two men met during a summit of Pacific rim leaders in Bangkok and instead stressed the positive aspects of the conversation .
"" We stated our readiness to resolve whatever questions that might emerge in our economic exchanges and trade through dialogue , "" he said , adding that they had agreed "" that the economic cooperation and trade between our two countries have benefited our two peoples tremendously "" .
Washington believes the renminbi , pegged at 8.28 to the US dollar , is undervalued by as much as 40 % , making Chinese exports much cheaper and costing America manufacturing jobs .
Some US legislators are urging Mr Bush to take the matter to the World Trade Organisation while others want Beijing 's special trading privileges revoked .
Mr Bush also did not refer to the dispute .
He said the presidents discussed the "" need to make sure that trade is open and that both countries benefit from trade "" .
Earlier in the day , speaking at a business leaders ' meeting occurring in tandem with the summit , Mr Hu was much more belligerent .
He said it would be "" irresponsible "" to alter China 's currency policy and said that , considering his country 's growth rate , "" it is quite normal for some frictions and some disputes to occur in the areas of trade "" .
The Chinese government reported on Friday that its economy grew by 9 % in the 12 months to the end of September , more than three times that rate of most industrialised nations .
Officials predicted the rapid expansion would continue for at least another quarter .
Mr Hu said yesterday such growth was a "" win - win outcome "" for the world . ""
China has a huge market of 1.3bn people to offer to the world .
China also offers much business opportunity to multinationals in the whole world .
"" Keeping the renminbi stable "" serves Chinese economic performance and conforms to the requirements of economic development in the Asia - Pacific region and the whole world "" , said Mr Hu , attending his first major international summit .
"" We will maintain the basic stability of the renminbi exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level . ""
The head of the WTO , Supachai Panitchpakdi , yesterday took Mr Hu 's side : "" China 's commitments are huge commitments .
Simply for that , China will need some time . """
2003-10-21,"China 's president , Hu Jintao , has supported George Bush 's push to prioritise the war on terror to help consolidate economic growth and stability .
Mr Hu told yesterday 's opening session of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of 21 Pacific rim leaders in Bangkok , that the nations should cooperate more closely to combat terrorism . ""
For some time , terrorist attacks have gone on unabated in the Asia - Pacific region , undermining the economic and social development of a number of countries , "" the Chinese leader said at the informal gathering .
"" We should respond ... with closer cooperation and stronger measures to address both the symptoms and root causes of the problem . ""
Mr Hu 's stance would have cheered Mr Bush who has been angling to put his war on terror at the top of the mainly economic forum 's agenda .
Most of yesterday 's 75-minutes of talks focused on the need to "" reinvigorate "" the World Trade Organisation .
The main security issue at the conference concerns North Korea 's nuclear arms programme .
Yesterday , it fired a missile into the Japan Sea , prompting Tokyo to comment that such an act was far from positive ."
2003-10-22,"The 21 leaders of the Pacific rim nations closed their annual trade summit yesterday with a declaration to support the US war on terror and "" eliminate the severe danger posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction "" .
Members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Bangkok said the measures were aimed particularly at solving the North Korea nuclear weapons crisis .
The Thai prime minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , said all the leaders backed the resumption of talks to reach a peaceful solution to the deadlock , a move echoed later by the Chinese president , Hu Jintao .
However Mr Thaksin could not name any commitment by the leaders carrying a definitive time - frame .
The leaders agreed there was a need for "" flexibility and political will ... to move the negotiations toward a successful conclusion "" .
But Rick Bowden , of ActionAid , said : "" Many developing countries fear the industrialised nations are still not willing to further open their markets or lower their subsidies . """
2003-11-13,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and Clarifications column , Thursday November 20 2003
In the column below , sub - headlined ' Presidents and the right to protest ' , we may unintentionally have given the impression that Jiang Zemin is still the Chinese president .
He was succeeded by Hu Jintao in November 2002 .
Here are some things that people think .
The majority of people , anyway .
People think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best books ever written .
People approve of the reintroduction of capital punishment ( lethal injection , for preference ) .
People want fox hunting banned .
Their favourite song is Bohemian Rhapsody .
People believe in ghosts and are in favour of identity cards .
Their favourite meal is fish and chips and they feel sure GM food is a very bad thing .
Almost half of them do n't think the MMR jab is safe .
People underestimate the hygiene complications of preparing a Christmas turkey .
They have never heard of the European Constitution .
They think parents have the right to know the name and address of any sex offender in the neighbourhood .
They think parental selection of a baby 's gender is so awful it should be banned .
Mercifully , for those who deviate from the majority position on most of the above , the public view does not have to be emulated , or obeyed .
We are not subject to its moronic line on literature , music or the paranormal .
On gender selection , however , the feelings of the mob are to be enforced .
When Suzy Leather , chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority , explained why this body , after a year 's review , now advocates a ban on sex selection , the main reason adduced for the decision was that the majority of people say they do n't like the idea .
Or as Leather put it , there is "" a substantial public consensus against sex selection for social reasons "" .
In this area , then , the conduct of your private life is to be directed by public consultation backed by a Mori poll .
Unless , that is , you have the energy and cash to defy the public fiat : sex selection is legally available , at a price , at private clinics in America and across the Channel .
Quite why "" people "" should be so against this ostensibly not very wicked expression of a preference is not easily understood .
If people had concluded , having completed the relevant research , that gender selection might result in a great preponderance of girls or boys , or an increased number of abortions or incidence of neglect , then one might sympathise with their fears , when polled .
The deputy chairman of the HFEA , Tom Baldwin , has said that much of the opposition sprang from "" widespread hostility "" , and from anxieties about a "" slippery slope "" .
So it is not because sex selection was found wanting by the HFEA experts , you gather , so much as to assuage the public 's nightmares about designer babies or hundreds of mini - Bin Ladens ( quite understandable if you watch a lot of late - night television ) that women such as Nicola Chenery , of Plymouth , who really wanted a daughter after her four boys , should now be prevented from having sex selection by IVF at a clinic in Spain .
If this decisive body of technophobes had got their way a bit earlier , Chenery 's twin baby girls would never have been born .
How fortunate , in fact , that Mori polls were not in charge around the time IVF was invented .
Ditto blood transfusion and heart transplants .
But it 's true : slippery slopes can be awfully worrying .
What , for example , are the implications of the HFEA 's deferral to public opinion in a country where politicians customarily go to great lengths to avoid doing what the public actually wants ?
Should we now look forward to seeing paedophiles in the stocks , zero fuel tax , the prohibition of speed limits , a quick exit from Europe and the immediate expulsion of all asylum seekers ?
The HFEA 's recourse to public sentiment suggests that consultation should go much further than that .
Most of us , after all , have some acquaintance with the issues of crime and of tax - paying , some opinion on public services .
In the case of sex selection , there can be no recourse to experience or , even , to folk wisdom .
It 's a question many poll respondents might never have considered before - unless you count inclining , secretly , to one sex or the other .
If fertility experts on the Clapham omnibus can decide policy on gender selection as well as the outcome of Pop Idol , there is no reason why they should not be invited to rule on other scientific advances likely to prompt substantial ethical debate .
Those clinicians currently hoping to attempt a facial transplant , for example , and the few gravely disfigured individuals who have expressed interest in the operation , may need to consider not only the profound questions of identity involved in such a procedure , but whether the public will , once again , be so utterly outraged by the affront to nature that doctors , ethicists and prospective patients must all bow to its opinion .
Presidents and the right to protest Is n't it time we had Jiang Zemin round ?
It 's been ages and on his last stay , thanks to Robin Cook 's insistence on sparing the feelings of the Chinese president , he hardly got to meet anyone .
Quite possibly he went home with the idea that the United Kingdom is , leaving aside 1,000-year - old eggs and the occasional peasouper , just like China .
A ruthless police state in which any dissent is either concealed from visitors or suppressed , if necessary by violence .
But after George Bush 's visit , that should all be different , should n't it ?
Even those who maintain that Bush is the vilest ruler of the most evil empire that ever existed must concede that , if his visit helps restore the right to peaceful protest that Cook suddenly withdrew in 1991 , it ca n't have been all bad .
Next time Jiang comes to stay , the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens will want to make sure that he sees the welcoming Tibetan flags , banners and T - shirts instead of having all the human rights demonstrators obscured from the presidential view or dragged away by police .
Unless , that is , Blair 's government has no objection to our shouting abuse at passing democrats , who are probably used to that sort of thing , but draws the line at anything that might offend the sensitive visitor from less tolerant climes .
There 's only one way to find out .
Come back , Jiang , and next time , bring your mates .
Where are the women ?
Was Patricia Hewitt well advised to make gleeful capital out of Michael Howard 's almost all - male shadow cabinet ?
True , Howard 's one - to-12 ratio is almost comically shameful ( though he was apparently spurned by Ann Widdecombe ) .
But is Blair 's record with women so much better ?
After the departure , hurt , of Mowlam , Short and Morris , Blair 's six senior women ( out of a cabinet of 21 ) are : an extremely disturbed person called Margaret Hodge , who seems in need of a long rest ; Tessa Jowell , who is probably busy with the Olympics ; the tireless caravanner Margaret Beckett ; the not - readily - identifiable Hilary Armstrong ; Baroness Valerie Amos ( appointed , does n't count ) ; and Patricia Hewitt herself , who is still having a little difficulty reconciling her 1970s feminism with the present day .
The Labour ministers with big jobs , are , like Howard 's favourites , all men .
Until Labour gets closer to electing a woman leader , any triumphalism in this department looks distinctly premature ."

2004-01-30,"More than 1,200 Communist party members killed themselves and 8,000 fled overseas during an anti - corruption crackdown in the first six months of last year , the Chinese media reported yesterday .
The extraordinary number of deaths and the flight of dirty money appears to have been the direct result of a drive by the new president , Hu Jintao , to curb the endemic graft that undermines the legitimacy of China 's ruling party .
Despite the high toll , the clean - up campaign is thought to have barely scratched the surface of the problem .
Last year top officials were punished at the rate of one a month , but most are too powerful to expose .
Miscarriages of justice and faked suicides are believed to be common .
Among the most prominent alleged suicides was that of Zhu Shengwen , a former deputy mayor of the north - eastern city of Harbin , who was sent to jail for taking £ 62,000 of bribes .
The official version of his death is that he threw himself out of a prison window only months before he was due to be released on parole .
His family dispute this , saying he was killed to cover up his investigation into embezzlement by officials .
The biggest target of investigators was Zhou Zhengyi , a Shanghai property tycoon , whose influential political contacts - thought to include the former president Ziang Zemin - have so far kept the prosecutors at bay .
Instead , lower ranking party members have taken the brunt of the blame .
According to the state - run Wen Wei Po daily , 1,252 party members killed themselves , 8,371 absconded and 6,528 disappeared in the first half of 2003 .
Countless others were given the death penalty or sent to prison .
The worst affected province was the richest - Guangdong , where 1,240 cadres fled overseas with illicitly earned fortunes .
Many are known to be the sons and daughters of party officials , who have exploited their parents ' power to secure state assets .
President Hu is said to be planning new moves to extradite these "" princelings "" and seize their overseas assets , estimated at more than £ 3.8bn .
In the latest scandal Cai Xiaohong , the son of a former justice minister , was arrested for selling state secrets to Britain .
During two decades of free market reform , the 65 million - strong party has maintained its grip on power but lost its ideological sense of mission , providing the ideal breeding ground for corruption .
Although the economy is growing at more than 8 % a year , income gaps between the rich and poor are widening .
Yet party officials are still paid according to an egalitarian scale that gives little recognition of their authority .
The difference between the salaries of a junior clerk and a division chief is typically less than £ 5 a month .
During the heyday of China 's revolution , the model Communist cadre was supposed to pursue the goal of a socialist utopia , work for the good of the people , and retire with the respect due to a lifelong servant of the country .
But today many are likely to buy their way up the career ladder , enrich themselves through bribes , and then either flee the country or kill themselves in disgrace .
The higher the position , the greater the potential for graft .
In Shenyang last year a court heard how the post of transport bureau director had been bought for £ 16,500 , while that of director of the tobacco monopoly bureau went for £ 13,000 .
The holders of both positions were given the death penalty ."
2004-02-06,"The Chinese government has said that at least 37 people died and 15 were injured in a stampede in a northern suburb of Beijing yesterday .
The official Xinhua news agency said many of the dead suffocated in the crush as a crowd gathered to mark the final day of the lunar new year celebrations .
President Hu Jintao expressed "" deep concern "" , and an investigation was ordered .
"" There could even be more people dead , "" said Wu Kun , a spokesman for the Beijing city government .
"" It 's still a very confusing scene up there . ""
Mr Wu said the tragedy was sparked when someone tripped and fell in Mihong Park , near the town of Miyun . ""
One person fell down on a grate in the park and caused many people to fall down .
There was a stampede , "" Mr Wu said .
"" It was a lot of people .
I 'm not sure how many .
These things are packed . ""
The prime minister , Wen Jiabao , ordered local authorities to find out how the accident happened and "" to try their best to save the injured and make suitable arrangement for the families of the dead "" .
Lantern festivals are held throughout China to mark the last day of the new year celebrations , which began on January 22 .
Scores of people have been killed in car accidents during the festivities , as hundreds of millions of people travelled to and from their family homes ."
2004-05-04,"When the president , Hu Jintao , and the prime minister , Wen Jiabao , came to power , early last year , optimists hoped the generational shift in leadership would herald the start of gradual democratic reform in China .
However , last week 's political blitzkrieg in Hong Kong reveals that Beijing 's new government is , if anything , more sophisticated in crushing opposition than any of its predecessors .
The shock - and - awe tactics used by the Communist party on the mainland have stunned the democratic camp in Hong Kong , which appeared to be in the ascendancy after last July 's huge rally , of 500,000 people .
At that time , hopes were still high that Messrs Hu and Wen were prepared to permit debate about political reform even on the mainland .
Policy papers advocating greater democracy were circulating in Beijing , and the Chinese media had been granted unusual freedoms to report on the outbreak of Sars .
But the display of people power last July , the success of the democrats in last autumn 's legislative elections in Hong Kong , and the - for Beijing - unwelcome result of the presidential poll in Taiwan , in March , appear to have triggered the old allergic reaction of the Communist party to democracy .
One by one , the doors of political reform have been slammed shut .
First , the government forbade any public discussion of the topic ahead of last October 's meeting of the state council .
In January , the pioneering journalists who exposed the official cover - up over Sars were arrested .
And most recently , in the space of just three weeks , the National People 's Congress acted with all the speed , secrecy and ruthlessness of a Chinese court in indefinitely postponing changes to the electoral system in Hong Kong .
The pace of Beijing 's offensive has been breathtaking .
For months , the government appeared to be sitting on its hands while Hong Kong 's democrats attempted to initiate debate on a widening of the franchise , which is permissible from 2007 under the Basic Law .
In late December , most people were expecting a year of public discussion in Hong Kong that would result in the legislative council 's formulating a set of reform proposals for Beijing 's consideration .
Instead , the mainland government has completely rewritten the rules in a demonstration of just how little autonomy Hong Kong has .
In early March , the National People 's Congress granted itself the power to rule on the subject of reform .
Last week , it declared that there would be no changes for the foreseeable future .
This meant a decision affecting millions of people , which ought to have been reached after a year of public debate in Hong Kong , became a summary verdict issued after just three weeks of closed - door sessions in Beijing .
Full , direct elections at the earliest possible date , 2007 , were always unlikely to be approved by Beijing , but the National People 's Congress did not even set out a timetable for reform .
Prime Minister Wen has stressed the ultimate goal for the territory is still universal suffrage .
However , many scholars now believe this will be pushed back - if it happens at all - until 2047 , at the very end of the 50-year "" one party , two systems "" transitional agreement signed in 1997 , when Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty .
Chinese officials made no bones about their distrust of democracy .
Qiao Xiaoyang , the head of a delegation sent to Hong Kong to explain the decision , said , "" Governments who are led by the nose of public opinion are irresponsible . ""
Given this attitude , it is hard to imagine that the Communist party will ever accept reform .
It appears much more comfortable with an elite , bureaucratic mandarinate .
Increased pluralism and accountability to China 's 1.3 billion population are seen as a recipe for instability .
Policy - makers argue that the country is simply not ready for democracy because of its level of economic development .
It is the reasoning of Britain 's aristocracy in the 19th century for denying the introduction of universal suffrage : the masses are not ready for democratic responsibility .
There might be some justification for this argument on the mainland , where the vast majority of the population are poorly educated peasants who have been fed nationalist propaganda for decades .
But it is hard to see how it can possibly apply in Hong Kong , which has one of the highest standards of living in Asia , a vibrant media and impressive education levels .
Clearly , the only reason Beijing is denying Hong Kong more democracy is because the Communist party feels threatened .
If an opposition - led administration were ever allowed to take power in the territory , it could spark calls for reform throughout China .
Such fears are nothing new .
The country 's leaders suspected the pre - handover widening of the franchise by the last British governor , Chris Patten , was aimed at creating a Trojan Horse for democracy .
They may well have been right , but that does not mean China 's best interests have been served by stifling the reform process in Hong Kong .
Social stability and trust in the government will not be enhanced by a decision that is unpopular and of dubious legality .
Opinion polls are already showing record levels of public unease about relations between Hong Kong and Beijing , with the most likely outlets a rally in July and legislative elections later in the year .
On a wider level , the decision also raises questions about the Communist party 's ability to reform itself .
The country 's leaders keep deferring democracy by saying reform can only come after greater economic development .
But if Hong Kong , the country 's richest territory , is not ready for more democracy , where is ?"
2004-08-26,"China 's leaders have raised the alarm about their country 's ability to feed itself as rapid development sucks land , water and people from the food - producing countryside into increasingly large and hungry cities .
After a steady fall in grain harvests , the world 's most populous nation recently became a net importer of food for the first time in its history , raising domestic political concerns and driving up international prices of wheat , rice and soya .
Hu Jintao , the president , has commissioned studies on food security .
The prime minister , Wen Jiabao , has visited a farm to urge peasants to boost production with a warning that grain security is a matter of social stability .
Ministers have hurriedly cancelled plans to develop farmland and the agricultural ministry is offering tax incentives to farmers who switch to grain production .
Food security is a visceral issue for a generation that grew up during the famines of the 40s and 50s , when an estimated 40 million people died of starvation largely as a result of the headlong charge towards industrialisation known as the Great Leap Forward .
Although China 's hefty foreign exchange reserves make it unlikely that there will be another famine any time soon , elderly leaders have watched with concern as the country 's agricultural surplus has disappeared just as the appetites of its increasingly affluent population has grown .
During Mao Zedong 's era , every local district was supposed to be self - sufficient in grain , which often necessitated diversion of scarce water resources into arid areas .
Now , however , the priority for the water and the land is industrial and urban development .
With economic zones opening up across the country and more than 10 million peasants moving into cities every year , the amount of arable land in China has shrunk by 6.7 m hectares ( 16.75 m acres ) since 1996 .
According to Lin Yueqin , an economic researcher at the China Social Science Academy , the growth of cities is largely to blame for last year 's record drop in grain supply .
"" Urbanisation has eaten into the size of the nation 's arable land .
Farmers feel there is little profit to be had from their traditional crops so we 've seen a long decline in grain output , "" he said .
Since 1998 's record harvest of 512 m tonnes , grain production has fallen every year to just over 400 m tonnes .
At the same time , appetites are growing .
The 9 % annual growth of the economy is pushing up wages and pushing out waistlines .
Urbanites are more likely to eat meat - which is fattened on grain - and they are more likely to be fat .
According to one study of children in Shanghai , 8 % of three- to six - year - olds are obese .
To feed this increasingly hungry population , China has had to look overseas .
In the first six months of the year , the value of food imports surged 62 % to $ 14.4bn ( £ 8bn ) .
Although the harvest may improve this year , it is thought unlikely to be enough to match rising demand .
Soyabean imports , which doubled last year to 20.3 m tonnes , are expected to double again this year .
The World Bank forecasts a rise in net grain imports from 14 m tonnes next year to 32 m tonnes in 2020 .
Even rice - the traditional staple - is more likely to come from neighbouring countries .
Such is the demand that Thai farmers report entire crops being bought long before har vests .
Vietnamese authories blame food - smuggling for a record 20 % increase in the price of rice .
For the first time , Pakistan is being approached as a rice supplier .
In one novel experiment , the Chongqing municipal government is leasing land in Laos to grow food for its urban population .
This has lead to a surge in global food prices .
Grain futures are up 30 % this year thanks largely to the China factor .
Although Beijing 's leaders are concerned that the growing dependence on imports - particularly grain from the US , Canada and Australia - is a strategic vulnerability , many economists argue that it makes sense to import because China must feed 20 % of the world 's population with only 7 % of the planet 's arable land .
China can also afford more imported food than in the past .
Thanks to a booming manufacturing sector , the country has healthy foreign exchange reserves of $ 470bn .
Most farmers would rather produce high - value , labour - intensive export crops like fruit and mushrooms than wheat and barley , which can be produced more cheaply in the US ."
2004-09-08,"Jiang Zemin , the conservative chief of the People 's Liberation Army , may announce his resignation within weeks , raising hopes for democratic reform in China and an easing of tensions over Taiwan and Hong Kong .
Senior Chinese academics said Jiang - a former president seen as the main obstacle to political change - could step down as chairman of the central military commission at a meeting of communist leaders this month .
Speculation has reached fever pitch this summer that the most influential Chinese politician of the past 15 years is ready to cede his last position of authority to his successor as president , Hu Jintao .
For months foreign China watchers have talked of a growing power struggle in Beijing between Hu - the head of the government - and Jiang , the head of the military .
Citing two sources close to the leadership , the New York Times yesterday reported that Mr Jiang told a meeting of senior officials last week that he plans to relinquish his authority .
"" It is quite possible that Jiang may retire , "" said Cao Siyuan , president of Beijing Siyuan Research Centre for Social Science .
Although public criticism of the leadership has long been curtailed , pro - reform academics in Beijing have become increasingly bold in targeting Mr Jiang and his Shanghai allies , who are blamed for blocking moves to ease restrictions on the media and debate on democratic reform .
As the fiercest advocate of the free market , the Jiang camp is also widely associated with rampant corruption , widening social inequality and economic overheating .
Through his control of the military Mr Jiang is also held responsible for the mainland 's hardline approach to Taiwan and Hong Kong , which runs contrary to Mr Hu 's softer diplomatic policy of a "" gentle rise "" of China .
In recent weeks influential Communist party publications such as the People 's Daily and the Study Times have focused on the ideas of "" balanced development "" and "" people first politics "" most closely associated with Mr Hu and his prime minister , Wen Jiabao .
Several senior academics say that Mr Jiang would be taking a risk if he held on to his post as military chief longer than the two years his predecessor , Deng Xiaoping , stayed in the job after relinquishing his other party posts .
"" If Jiang steps down this month , it would be normal , "" said Huang Weiping , the director of the political research centre of Shenzhen University .
However , Li Anming , the deputy director of the research centre of the Communist Party School , said : "" I do n't expect a change of leadership positions at the coming plenum . """

During Mao Zedong 's era every district was meant to be self - sufficient in grain , which often necessitated the diversion of scarce water resources into arid areas .
Now the priority for the water and the land is industrial and urban development .
With economic zones opening up across the country and more than 10 million peasants moving into cities every year , the amount of arable land in China has shrunk by 6.7 m hectares since 1996 .
According to Lin Yueqin , an economic researcher at the China Social Science Academy , the growth of cities is largely to blame for last year 's record drop in grain supply .
"" Urbanisation has eaten into the size of the nation 's arable land .
Farmers feel there is little profit to be had from their traditional crops so we 've seen a long decline in grain output . ""
Since 1998 's record harvest of 512 m tonnes , grain production has fallen every year to just over 400 m tonnes .
At the same time appetites are growing .
The 9 % annual growth of the economy is pushing up wages and pushing out waistlines .
Urbanites are more likely to eat meat and more likely to be fat .
According to one study of children in Shanghai , 8 % of three- to six - year - olds are obese .
To feed this increasingly hungry population , China has had to look overseas .
In the first six months of the year , the value of food imports surged 62 % to $ 14.4bn .
Although the harvest may improve this year , it is thought unlikely to be enough to match rising demand .
Soyabean imports , which doubled last year to 20.3 m tonnes , are expected to double again this year .
The World Bank forecasts a rise in net grain imports from 14 m tonnes next year to 32 m tonnes in 2020 .
Even rice - the traditional staple - is more likely to come from neighbouring countries .
Such is the demand from China that Thai farmers report entire crops being bought long before harvests .
Vietnamese authorities blame food - smuggling for a record 20 % increase in the price of rice .
In one novel experiment the Chongqing municipal government is leasing land in Laos to grow food .
This has led to a surge in global food prices .
Grain futures are up 30 % this year thanks largely to the China factor .
Although Beijing 's leaders are concerned that the growing dependence on imports - particularly grain from the US , Canada and Australia - is a strategic vulnerability , many economists argue that it makes sense to import because China must feed 20 % of the world 's population with only 7 % of the planet 's arable land .
China can also afford more imported food than in the past .
Thanks to a booming manufacturing sector , the country has foreign exchange reserves of $ 470bn .
Most farmers would rather produce high - value , labour - intensive export crops like fruit and mushrooms than wheat and barley , which can be produced more cheaply in the US ."
2004-09-19,"The former Chinese President , Jiang Zemin , has tendered his resignation as head of the People 's Liberation Army , according to reports yesterday , raising hopes for political reform in the world 's most populous nation .
Jiang , who was widely blamed for holding up democratic change , will be replaced today as chief of the military by President Hu Jintao , according to the South China Morning Post .
If the move goes ahead , it would complete the smoothest transition of power in the history of the Communist party , but Jiang is likely to retain much influence through his supporters on the Politburo .
When he stepped down as President almost two years ago , Jiang held on to the military post in an apparent effort to safeguard his legacy .
But throughout the summer pressure has been building on him to step down .
Last month he was airbrushed from an old photograph showing Hu meeting paramount leader Deng Xiaoping .
Celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Deng - the father of China 's modernisation - were also used to push the message that Jiang should go .
In a prominent speech Deng 's daughter hailed her father as an example of not clinging to power .
Earlier this month unnamed sources told the New York Times that Jiang had announced plans for his retirement .
Senior academics have been unusually willing publicly to criticise the former President for blocking media liberalisation .
A raft of reports now suggests that the 78-year - old has decided enough is enough .
Jiang is reported to have tendered his resignation at the start of the party plenum , which began last Thursday . '
His health is very poor ...
He wants to go , ' a family member told Reuters .
Jiang has had a heart problem since 1989 , when he rose to power amid the reshuffle that followed the Tiananmen Square massacre .
The news has yet to be announced in China , but it is certain to encourage supporters of democratic reform .
Cao Siyuan , president of Beijing Siyuan Research Centre for Social Science , said the resignation would improve the health of the nation 's politics . '
We have had more than 20 years of economic reform and now we need political reform .
Both legs are important , ' he said . '
In the vast majority of countries , the political leader is also the head of the military .
We should follow the global trend . '
Foreign observers said the political climate was conducive to a full transition of power to Hu and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao . '
The views of the new leadership are far more prominent than a year ago , ' said a diplomatic source . '
They appear to be more in charge . '
Jiang may feel confident that his legacy is already assured .
His theory of the ' Three Represents ' was written into the constitution earlier this year , alongside Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory .
Many of his allies also hold key positions .
At least five of the nine - man Politburo are loyal to Jiang .
Chief among them is Zeng Qinghong , who may be given a senior military position to balance Hu 's expected assumption of power today .
Jiang , who enjoys a reputation of boastfulness , is unlikely to disappear quietly into the shadows .
He can claim considerable achievements under his leadership , including spectacular economic growth , accession to the World Trade Organisation and the successful bid for the 2008 Olympics .
But analysts said he lacks the charisma to wield the same degree of backroom influence as did his predecessor , Deng Xiaoping , who pulled the strings many years after his retirement ' We are unlikely to see a major shift in policy , but gradually Jiang 's influence will fade , ' said Huang Weiping , director of the political research centre of Shenzhen University . '
Jiang is not powerful enough to play the role of Deng . '"
2004-09-20,"The president of China , Hu Jintao , squeezed his predecessor and main rival Jiang Zemin out of the top military post yesterday , easing the way for a new generation of leaders to stamp their image on the world 's most populous country .
After months of speculation about a power struggle at the top of the Communist party , the state media announced that Mr Jiang had stepped down as chairman of the central military commission .
The 78-year - old , who rose to his position in the aftermath of the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 , had three years of his term to run , but a statement issued by the party central committee made it clear that a divided leadership was not in the interests of the country . ""
The plenum unanimously agreed that the change is conducive to upholding the fundamental principle and system of the party 's absolute leadership over the military , "" the communique issued at the end of the four - day annual meeting of senior party officials said .
His replacement as commander in chief will be Mr Hu , who is now unrivalled as the head of the state , party and military - the three most powerful positions in the country .
But at least four of the nine members of the politburo , including the propaganda chief , are considered proteges of Mr Jiang .
The senior ranks of the armed forces are also packed with generals promoted by the outgoing chief .
Mr Jiang has yet to say why he stepped down .
In recent weeks there have been reports that he is suffering from a heart condition and , possibly , cancer .
Several academics have said that he may be following the example set by China 's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , who gave up his military post two years after resigning from the politburo .
Mr Jiang 's legacy was assured this year when his concept of the "" Three Represents "" - which encouraged capitalists to join the Communist party - was written into the constitution alongside Mao Zedong 's Thought and Deng Xiaoping 's Theory .
To smooth the most peaceful transition of power in modern Chinese history the plenum commended Mr Jiang 's "" outstanding contributions to the party , the state and the people "" .
Political analysts and diplomatic sources said they did not expect any sudden change of policy , but there is a high public expectation that the consolidation of power will allow the leadership to be bolder in pursuing greater social equality , gradual democratic reform and improved relations with Hong Kong .
Despite the party 's monolithic image , senior communist sources say control has swung from the right to the left in the past two years .
Mr Jiang , a proponent of free - market economics , tight media control and a nationalistic hard line on Taiwan , was in the former camp .
Mr Hu and his prime minister , Wen Jiabao , are associated with a policy of "" balanced development "" aimed at centralising power to tackle the glaring inequalities between the urban rich and the rural poor .
They were praised for their handling of the Sars crisis last year , when the media was given unprecedented freedom to expose official cover - ups .
Advocates of political reform say Mr Hu and Mr Wen have greater democratic instincts than their predecessors .
In Hong Kong and Taiwan , politicians and academics believe Mr Hu will take a less confrontational stance than his predecessor .
Yesterday the plenum also strengthened the country 's ability to use force to prevent Taiwan from proclaiming independence , and added three to the membership of the military commission , representatives of the navy , air force and artillery corps ."

Minxin Pei International Herald Tribune , September 21 ""
Although Mr Jiang 's resignation has been hailed as a milestone ... in modern Chinese political history , he has broken no precedent .

Instead , Mr Jiang ... was viewed widely as unwilling to cede the stage to Mr Hu . ""
John Tkacik Wall Street Journal Europe , September 21 "" In the two years since Mr Hu 's appointment as Communist party chief he has seen his moderate policies often undercut by allies of Mr Jiang , and this is likely to continue under the new arrangement .

For the time being , that is very much doubted , given China 's continued belligerent sabre - rattling at Taiwan .
What China should do is provide assurances to countries in east and south - east Asia that it will not wage war across the Taiwan Strait .
In this regard , Mr Hu must depart from Mr Jiang 's tough stand . """
2004-10-01,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , has told the People 's Liberation Army to prepare for war amid growing fears of a destabilising missile race across the Taiwan Strait .
Just days after rival leaders in Taipei threatened to target Shanghai to achieve a "" balance of terror "" , Mr Hu used his first speech as commander in chief to demonstrate that he was as ready to use force as his predecessor , Jiang Zemin , to prevent the island from declaring independence .
"" You must seize the moment and do a good job of preparing for a military struggle , "" the president told the 2.5 million strong PLA , according to comments carried in the People 's Daily yesterday .
Although he did not mention the name of a likely enemy , no one doubted that he was referring to Taiwan , which Beijing regards as a renegade province .
Tensions between the two sides have hit a new pitch in recent days as Taiwanese leaders play up fears of a missile barrage to push through a controversial arms budget .
Taiwan 's president , Chen Sui - bian , warned that the PLA had 610 missiles pointed at the island , up from 496 in December .
With the number continuing to increase sharply , he forecast China would have 800 ballistic weapons in place by 2006 - enough for a sustained 10-hour barrage that could wipe out most of Taiwan 's defences before its ally , the United States , could respond .
To deter such an attack , the Taiwanese prime minister , Yu Shyi - kun , called for the development of an offensive missile system .
"" You fire 100 missiles at me , I fire 50 at you .
You hit Taipei and Kaohsiung .
I at least hit Shanghai , "" he said , mentioning Taiwan 's two biggest cities and the mainland 's financial capital . ""
If we have such counter - strike capability today , Taiwan is safe . ""
Until now Taiwan has - at least in public - focused on defence rather than deterrence .
This is the preferred policy of the US , which does not want to get dragged into a conflict in east Asia .
So the first mention of a retaliatory strike by such a senior figure sparked outrage in Beijing . ""
Yu Shyi - kun 's remarks are a serious provocation and clamouring for war , "" said Li Weiyi , spokesman for the Taiwan affairs office .
The Taiwan defence ministry has since tried to douse the incendiary comments , saying the island had no policy to maintain a "" balance of terror "" .
But the furore is unlikely to die down quickly .
The Taiwanese government has stoked the rhetoric to try to push through an $ 18bn ( £ 10bn ) budget to buy arms from the US .
President Chen says the submarines , Patriot anti - missile systems and submarine - hunting aircraft are essential to meet the growing menace of China .
But the spending package - the biggest US weapons deal in a decade - has prompted protests in Taipei from critics who say it will spark an arms race , choke the country 's economy and divert resources from healthcare and social security .
Surveys indicate that half of the 23 million population oppose the outlay .
On both sides of the strait , concerns are growing of a confrontation before 2008 , when Mr Chen has promised to revise Taiwan 's constitution - a move seen in Beijing as tantamount to a declaration of independence .
China 's prime minister , Wen Jiabao , said Beijing would firmly oppose separatist forces in Taiwan .
"" The sacred goal of complete national reunification must be achieved .
It shall be achieved in the end , "" he said in a speech to mark the 55th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic ."
2004-12-22,"The Chinese police arrested one of the country 's most influential journalists yesterday in the latest phase of their campaign to stifle critical discussion by prominent liberal intellectuals .
The detention of Chen Min , the chief editorial writer at China Reform Magazine , has heightened concern that the Communist party may be reverting to old - style repression to counter the spread of independent thinking on the internet , in the universities , and in the increasingly bold media organisations .
Coming after the arrest or demotion of at least half a dozen other "" public intellectuals "" - a term of former media praise that has suddenly become an expression of political abuse - it has upset the hope that President Hu Jintao will allow more freedom of expression than his predecessor , Jiang Zemin .
Mr Chen , who wrote under the pen name Xiao Shu , was working in his office when security officers arrived unannounced .
"" They went to the magazine office and took him away , "" an unnamed source told Reuters .
The tactic appears to be similar to that used in several other cases .
On December 13 three prominent reform advocates , Yu Jie , Liu Xiabo and Zhang Zuhua , were held by the police and accused of revealing state secrets to foreigners : a catch - all phrase often invoked in clampdowns on critics .
Two weeks earlier the poet Shi Tao was arrested on his way to his mother 's house and his wife was warned not to tell anyone he was missing .
Echoing past campaigns against "" rightists "" and "" counter - revolutionary "" critics , the clampdown was heralded by a furious invective against "" public intellectuals "" in the Liberation Daily on November 23 .
In language observers said was reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution , it accused such intellectuals of "" arrogant elitism "" .
They were trying to "" estrange the relationship between the party and intellectuals and between intellectuals and the masses "" , said the commentary , which was reproduced in full by People 's Daily , the party mouthpiece .
Shortly afterwards reports emerged of a "" grey list "" of liberal academics and journalists whose writings were no longer allowed to be published in newspapers and magazines , all of which are controlled by the state or the party .
Journalists say the propaganda department has also lengthened its list of forbidden topics , including stories about the growing gap between rich and poor and a number of big protests in the provinces .
As was the case in many previous political campaigns , the targets appear to have little in common other than a record of challenging someone in authority .
Among those who have been either demoted or detained are Jiao Guobiao , a media professor at Beijing University , who accused the propaganda department of using Nazi tactics to cover up corruption and disease ; Li Boguang , a lawyer who has represented farmers against the government in one of many cases of alleged illegal land seizures ; and Huang Jingao , a local party official who blew the whistle on corruption among his colleagues in Fujian province .
The clampdown fits into a long cycle of loosening and tightening intellectual expression in China , the last major phase of which took place in the late 1980s and ended with the massacre in Tiananmen Square .
Although most of those arrested recently have subsequently been released , making this a relatively restrained clampdown compared with the violence of previous campaigns , it has disappointed liberal supporters of President Hu .
Many had expected him to loosen media restrictions after removing Mr Jiang from the senior military post this summer .
But in the face of increasingly frequent reports of unrest in the provinces and strikes in urban centres , Mr Hu appears to have moved in the opposite direction .

2005-02-15,"A gas explosion at a Chinese coal mine has killed at least 203 people , the country 's worst reported mining disaster for decades .
The explosion yesterday at the Sunjiawan mine in the northeastern Liaoning province also injured 22 others and trapped 13 people underground .
President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders issued orders for local officials "" to spare no effort to rescue those stranded in the mine , "" the official Xinhua news agency reported Rescuers have faced roads made wet by an overnight snowfall and below freezing temperatures .
A government team headed by a member of China 's cabinet arrived at the Sunjiawan mine today to help find the missing , treat the injured and prepare compensation for the victims ' families .
China has suffered a string of deadly mining disasters in recent months despite a nationwide safety campaign .
Its mines are by far the world 's most dangerous , with more than 6,000 deaths last year in floods , explosions and fires .
The government said the toll was 8 % below the number killed the previous year , but its fatality rate per ton of coal mined is still 100 times that of the US .
China says it accounted for 80 % of all coal mining deaths worldwide last year .
A blast in the northern province of Shaanxi in November killed 166 miners .
Another in October killed 148 .
Yesterday 's disaster was the worst reported by the Chinese government since the 1949 communist revolution .
But until the late 1990s , when the government began regularly announcing statistics on mining deaths , many industrial accidents were never disclosed .
In 1942 , China 's north - east was the site of the world 's deadliest coal mining disaster when an accident killed 1,549 miners in Japanese - occupied Manchuria during the second world war .
Mine owners and local officials are frequently blamed for putting profits ahead of safety , especially as the nation 's soaring energy needs increase demand for coal .
Underground explosions often are blamed on a lack of ventilation equipment to remove gas that seeps from the coal bed ."
2005-03-04,"Speculation about the possible early departure of Hong Kong 's chief executive , Tung Chee - hwa , went into overdrive on Tuesday , when the Hong Kong papers reported he is expected to resign next week after being nominated to fill a senior post in Beijing .
The territory 's business daily , the Standard , was "" puzzled "" by claims that the move indicated the 67-year - old , who has more than two years left to serve in his second term , was still in favour with Beijing .
Why would Hu Jintao , the new Chinese president , promote someone who he "" publicly admonished "" in December for repeated failures in office , such as the handling of the Sars outbreak , and who is so "" detested by so many in Hong Kong "" that 500,000 people demonstrated for political reform in 2003 ?
It was all a calculated move , said Janus Lam at Asia Times online .
The Chinese leadership "" can save itself from having to defend an increasingly unpopular leader whose tenure in office has been marked by policy failures , popular discontent and massive protest "" .
In Britain , the Daily Telegraph thought China was using the resignation to stall demands in Hong Kong for universal suffrage .
The timing meant a successor could be chosen by the pro - Beijing election committee before its term expired in July , said the paper .
The new chief executive would serve until 2010 , "" which would cover the politically sensitive period leading to Beijing 's staging of the Olympic games in 2008 .
"" If the successor were to be Donald Tsang Yam - kuen , Mr Tung 's deputy , the South China Morning Post saw cause for concern . ""
Hong Kong needs a new leader , "" said the territory 's leading English - langauge daily . ""
Mr Tsang 's record is one of the subservience expected of a senior bureaucrat to his political masters .
He has done it well enough and can deal with the press and public in a way that is alien to Mr Tung .
But that is not leadership .
"" A lack of media skills led to Mr Tung 's downfall , said Tom Plate in the Korea Times .
"" Contemporary government is to a large extent government by media , "" he argued .
"" Beijing leaders , who have been so critical of Mr Tung , do not have to deal with the Hong Kong news media as Mr Tung did .
They should realise what hell he has been through . """
2005-03-23,"Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , ended her week - long , six - nation tour of Asia on Monday .
Her last stop was Beijing , where she met the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , and received a warm welcome in the local press . ""
US diplomacy in east Asia is different from its methods in the Middle East : it does not mind multilateral means , and shows more restraint and politeness , "" said Beijing 's Xin Jing Bao .
Ms Rice 's visit had helped to "" consolidate Sino - US relations "" , echoed the Shanghai - based Diyi Caijing Ribao .
But elsewhere , Ms Rice 's tour was seen in less glowing terms .
The Taipei Times took her to task for not trying harder to persuade China "" to reduce cross - strait tensions "" .
She had done nothing , said the paper , to relieve Taiwan 's anxiety about China 's new anti - secession law , which "" legitimised "" China 's "" threat of war against Taiwan "" .
Ms Rice also adopted "" a moderate tone "" in North Korea , wrote Nailene Chou Wiest in the South China Morning Post . ""
[ She ] repeated the US offer , first made nine months ago , of a verbal security guarantee and energy aid in return for Pyongyang ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons . ""
But it is far from certain how "" the unpredictable North will respond in the coming days "" , warned the Korea Times .
The "" US message - seen from Pyongyang 's point of view - does n't seem to have much meat on its bones "" .
Larry Pressler in the New York Times , meanwhile , said Ms Rice should have shown a more "" robust pro - India stance "" .
Instead , America wants to sell 25 F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan , "" a corrupt , absolute dictatorship "" with "" a horrendous record on human rights and religious tolerance "" .
But India 's Statesman did not share those concerns : "" In crying foul over the F-16s when Ms Rice came calling we took a giant leap backwards , "" it argued .
Pakistan has its legitimate "" military requirements "" and it is wrong to "" suggest that both Indo - US and Indo - Pak relations would be hostage to a couple of F-16 squadrons "" .
It may not be clear how much the tour as a whole achieved , concluded the Washington Post , but at least Ms Rice has emerged as "" a forceful advocate of democratisation "" and "" greater political and religious freedom "" ."
2005-04-07,"When President Hu Jintao assumed the chairmanship of China 's central military commission in September , he quickly demonstrated the incisive managerial style that has distinguished him from his predecessor , Jiang Zemin .
But as is often the case in the People 's Republic , impressive external appearances may have served to conceal internal weakness .
After only five days at the helm , Mr Hu set out a tough policy for dealing with Taiwan 's "" splittists "" .
The People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) , he said , must "" strive for negotiation , prepare for war , and have no fear of Taiwan 's procrastination "" .
This business - like mantra was typical of Mr Hu and a new , savvier generation of Communist party technocrats .
"" Hu is an intellectual .
He 's not a charismatic leader like Mao or Deng Xiaoping .
There 's a more collective leadership these days .
But he is a tougher opponent than Jiang , "" a senior Taipei security source said .
Craftier , too , suggest seasoned China watchers .
For in taking his stand on Taiwan , Mr Hu , unlike Mr Jiang , avoided any mention of a reunification deadline or timetable that might prove unachievable .
While his words sounded powerful and urgent , they committed him to nothing and distanced him from possible failure .
According to Andrew Yang , of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies , this sort of creative ambiguity has become a necessity for a Chinese leadership less in charge of events at home than the outside world supposes .
"" The Chinese regime is approaching a major turning point .
It will continue with economic development , it has no choice .
But it has to change itself , too , and it knows it , "" Dr Yang said .
"" The domestic problems of the central government are so huge , they are really beyond its control .
China really is too big a country to manage . ""
Growing disparity of incomes , north - south disputes , the widening rural - urban split , unemployment , particularly of demobilised PLA troops , unchecked corruption and regional ethnic unrest were all straining Beijing 's capacities .
China 's "" economic miracle "" , so dazzling to the west , lacked durable political foundations , Dr Yang suggested .
Without structural reform , boom could turn to bust .
Far from hoping for a Chinese meltdown , most Taiwanese fear an economic crash and political upheaval on the mainland almost as much as a PLA invasion .
Taiwanese entrepreneurs have invested about $ 100bn in China ; and despite the political stand - off , human and cultural ties remain strong .
According to Taiwan 's Straits Exchange Foundation , 600,000 Taiwanese live and work on the mainland .
"" There are many hidden tensions and strains and an undercurrent of social turmoil inside China , "" said Anne Hsiao , of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy .
But unrest largely went unreported in the state - controlled media .
"" If the domestic problems grow , the government may be tempted to make a more aggressive foreign policy towards Taiwan , "" she said .
According to the security source , democracy in China is in retreat .
Harassment , including arrests , of academics , journalists and other dissenters has grown since Mr Hu took power .
Millions have been spent on perfecting internet censorship .
"" Hu has less tolerance for critics - he ca n't afford it , "" the source said .
Escalating energy demand and frequent area power cuts , meanwhile , were handicapping growth , the source said .
"" Energy is a huge issue .
In 1993 China was an oil exporter , now oil imports are running at about 20 - 30 % of total requirement .
By 2010 , imports will be 50 % .
That 's why they 're scraping and digging all around the East China Sea . ""
Worries about China 's stability are not confined to the neighbourhood .
Recent University of Maryland research classed China as one of the world 's "" fragile states "" .
But according to Dr Yang , internal problems could help constrain China 's military ambition .
"" On the whole the Chinese military is still pretty backward .
They have sizeable land forces but they 're outdated .
They can barely protect themselves ...
China 's navy has never been considered a ' blue water ' navy .
It mostly does coastal defence . ""
The government 's medium - term focus remained the securing of China 's peripheral boundaries ( including Taiwan ) and its offshore exclusive economic zones .
With pressure for reform steadily increasing , a decentralised or federal system for China , similar to that in the US or Germany , is gaining greater attention inside and outside the country .
Some experts say greater autonomy or a form of devolution , especially in wealthier southern and eastern coastal provinces , could ease Beijing 's control problems - and might help stabilise occupied Tibet and China 's Muslim west .
But such ideas would represent a bold move for a centralised , cautious leadership .
And a loosening of the bonds with Beijing might produce several new Taiwans .
While Taipei would enjoy that irony , Mr Hu , like the Soviet Union 's Mikhail Gorbachev , would risk going down in history as China 's splittist - in - chief ."
2005-04-21,"China 's headlong scramble for Africa will gather high - level impetus today when President Hu Jintao joins dozens of African and Asian leaders at a celebratory summit in Indonesia .
The meeting marks the 50th anniversary of the Bandung conference - the moment when developing countries began to join forces .
It foreshadowed the creation of the Non - Aligned Movement six years later .
In Bandung , Zhou Enlai represented communist China alongside national founding fathers such as India 's Nehru and Egypt 's Nasser .
But Mr Hu will not be advocating revolutionary solidarity in the teeth of western colonialist oppression .
His post - imperial message to Africa is all business : economic self - interest and development , trade pacts , investment and bilateral aid .
Increased cooperation with Africa , he said last week , was China 's "" strategic choice "" .
China is hoping to accelerate its already spectacularly successful drive to tap the African natural resources it needs to fuel its rapid economic modernisation .
And to the gratification of leaders such as Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe and Sudan 's Omar Bashir , Chinese deals come with few political strings ; at least for now .
Ignoring human rights abuses , electoral fraud and western sanctions , China has supplied military equipment and interest - free loans to Mr Mugabe 's government .
It also tiled the roof of his $ 9 m ( £ 4.7 m ) presidential mansion for free , made T - shirts for his youth militia and provided a radio jammer to help silence opposition broadcasts .
China has gained favoured access to Zimbabwe 's gold and platinum resources and new markets for its manufacturing exports .
This pattern is repeated across Africa .
China opposed UN oil sanctions over Darfur because Sudan , where it has invested $ 4bn , supplies 5 % of its oil imports .
It agreed a "" strategic partnership "" last week with Nigeria , a big oil exporter , and has oil interests in Angola , Chad and Gabon .
Major trading relationships are developing with South Africa and Egypt , while Chinese - financed infrastructure , telecoms and tourism projects are proliferating from Sierra Leone and Rwanda to Madagascar and Lesotho .
In all , China - Africa trade has doubled to more than $ 20bn since 2000 , and is projected to double again by 2009 .
At that rate , China will soon surpass the US , whose trade with Africa in 2004 was valued at $ 30bn . ""
China sees Africa as a source of vital strategic resources , "" said Andrew Yang of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies .
"" But it is also promoting multilateralism to balance George Bush 's unilateralism .
It wants to elevate China 's standing in the world .
"" China is not oblivious to western concerns about rights and democracy , Dr Yang said .
But it puts respect for national sovereignty first .
"" It depends on each country 's priorities .
China thinks it can share its experience as a developing country which has replaced the old colonialism and is building a market system . ""
Beijing does insist that its African partners back its "" one China "" policy and shun Taiwan .
Support for China in international forums is quietly encouraged .
But its political demands have been limited so far .
Its approach has been compared favourably with that of 19th - century European empire - builders in the original scramble for Africa , who tried to "" civilise "" and convert - and with the depredations of western multinationals .
Zephirin Diabre , of the UN Development Programme , speaking at last month 's launch of the Beijing - based China - Africa Business Council , praised Chinese assistance for healthcare , education and agriculture in Africa .
Beijing was "" a strong supporter of south - south cooperation "" , he said , and had set an example by cancelling or reducing $ 1.2bn of debt owed by 31 states , and agreeing tariff exemptions .
All the same , African complaints are growing about widening trade imbalances , damage to indigenous industries caused by the dumping of Chinese textiles and other products , poor labour conditions and Chinese arms sales in conflict zones .
Western governments also watch China 's energetic advance with unease .
"" China is sucking in all these resources at the expense of the west and the developing countries , "" one diplomat said .
"" China is an economic black hole . """
2005-04-29,"The Taiwanese opposition leader , Lien Chan , and the president of China , Hu Jintao , held a historic meeting today in Beijing for the highest - level talks since the two sides split amid civil war in 1949 .
The two men promised to work together to end hostilities between Beijing and the island .
The Chinese president and the chairman of Taiwan 's Nationalist party smiled and shook hands in the Great Hall of the People , China 's national assembly , which is on the western edge of Tiananmen square .
In a ceremony televised live in both China and Taiwan , Mr Hu told Mr Lien that Beijing and Taipei should focus on "" peace , stability and development for the future "" .
Mr Lien responded : "" We absolutely should avoid confrontation and collisions .
What we want is conciliation .
We want dialogue . ""
His visit is the first by a Nationalist leader since the party , which once ruled all of China , fled the mainland following its defeat by the communists almost 60 years ago .
Relations have warmed in recent years as the two parties united in opposition to the Taiwanese president , Chen Shui - bian , who wants formal independence for the self - ruled island , a step that Beijing says it would go to war to stop .
The Nationalists favour reunification with the mainland .
Mr Hu said Mr Lien 's trip to China had "" already injected new vitality "" into relations between Beijing and Taipei , which have no official ties despite surging trade .
"" We should show the world that Chinese from both sides of the Taiwan Strait have the ability and the wisdom to resolve our contradictions and problems ... and to promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , "" Mr Hu said .
After emerging from closed - door talks , the two leaders issued a joint statement promising to work together to try to end hostilities between Beijing and Taipei .
Mr Lien said the commitment was just a suggestion from his party as it did not control Taiwan 's government .
Mr Lien said at a news conference : "" Frankly , whether this can be done depends on whether the governing party will take responsibility ... the Nationalist party as an opposition party can only put it forward as a suggestion . ""
The joint statement also promised to promote Taiwan 's participation in international bodies .
Beijing usually tries to block Taiwan 's effort to join bodies such as the United Nations .
It was not clear whether China was dropping its opposition to Taiwan 's membership as a sovereign government or would insist the island be treated as part of the communist mainland .
Earlier today , in a 40-minute speech to students at the elite Peking University , Mr Lien called for the two sides to "" build a bridge to unite our people "" .
Mr Lien said : "" This is something that our people will welcome because we want to avoid confrontation across the Taiwan Strait and our people would like to see dialogue and reconciliation and cooperation ... we ca n't stay in the past forever . ""
The opposition leader said recent Chinese reforms , including non - partisan elections to village - level posts , were closing the political gap between the communist mainland and democratic Taiwan .
He said he hoped to ease tensions with Beijing , which enacted an anti - secession law in March authorising military action if Taiwan moves toward formal independence .
Mr Lien appealed to both governments to "" maintain the status quo "" - a reference to the unspoken deal under which Beijing refrains from attacking as long as Taiwan does not declare formal independence .
After his speech he walked around the leafy Peking University campus , where crowds of hundreds of students cheered as he passed .
"" It 's good that he 's come here after so many years , "" said Su Yonggan , a 28-year - old software student .
"" No one wants war . ""
Mr Lien began his eight - day mainland tour on Tuesday in Nanjing , the eastern city that was the Nationalist capital .
Today 's Lien - Hu meeting was the first between leaders of their parties since Nationalist dictator Chiang Kai - shek and communist guerrilla commander Mao Zedong held talks in 1945 in an attempt to create a national unity government .
They failed to reach agreement and , after four years of war , the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan .
Mr Chen 's election in 2000 put an end to decades of Nationalist rule in Taiwan and provided the Nationalists and communists with a common cause .
Taiwan is a major potential flashpoint in Asia .
Although the United States has no official ties with Taiwan , it is the island 's main arms supplier and could be drawn into any conflict .
Taiwan barred contact with the mainland for decades , but has eased those limits since the early 90s .
Since then , Taiwanese companies have invested around £ 50bn in China .
Analysts disagree on whether Mr Lien 's trip will help ease tensions .
Some say the former vice - president and foreign minister can win Beijing 's trust but others believe Chinese leaders are using Mr Lien to widen the schisms in Taiwanese society ."
2005-04-29,"Nearly 60 years after their messy political estrangement , Taiwanese nationalists and Chinese communists suspended hostility yesterday with a simple handshake between their leaders in Beijing .
Lien Chan , the leader of Taiwan 's Kuomintang nationalists , and Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , promised to try to end the standoff between Beijing and Taipei that has more than once threatened to tilt east Asia into conflict .
Their handshake , broadcast on live television , in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing heralded the highest - profile meeting between the two sides since the communists routed the Kuomintang in 1949 and drove it from mainland China .
But the government in Taipei frowned on the meeting , saying it would do nothing to improve tense relations between mainland China and independence - minded Taiwan .
"" We are disappointed that he went to an enemy country and did not express the majority view of Taiwan 's people , which is that Taiwan is a sovereign , independent country , "" Chen Chin - jun , an official from the ruling Democratic Progressive party , told reporters . ""
He did not stress this , and instead stressed the idea of a greater China .
Where did he put the feelings of the Taiwan people ? ""
Mr Hu was quoted as telling Mr Lien that Beijing and Taipei should focus on "" peace , stability and development for the future "" .
The response was equally conciliatory .
"" We absolutely should avoid confrontation and collisions , "" Mr Lien said .
"" What we want is conciliation .
We want dialogue . ""
The DPP criticised Mr Lien for failing to win guarantees from China that Taiwan would not be attacked if it shunned reunification .
Mr Lien , Taipei said in a statement , "" did not convince the Chinese communists to reduce their missile threat "" .
An estimated 600 to 700 ballistic missiles are located along China 's coast in what many see as a direct warning to Taipei not to pursue independence .
While Lien favours unification with the mainland , the Taiwanese president , Chen Shui - bian , whose election in 2000 ended decades of nationalist rule , supports formal independence for the island .
Yesterday 's meeting was widely interpreted as an attempt by Beijing to isolate Mr Chen and others who support independence , a policy that China has warned could spark a military conflict .
China still considers Taiwan as part of its territory and is adamant it will again be governed directly from Beijing .
In an address at Peking University , Mr Lien said : "" I believe the door has been opened . ""
How to walk towards a new future , towards a new outlook , through this door , I think the ruling party has to shoulder more responsibilities . ""
In talks behind closed doors that lasted about two hours , Mr Hu and Mr Lien also agreed to push for greater bilateral trade and investment .
The meeting was the first between leaders of their parties since the Nationalist dictator Chiang Kai - shek and Mao Zedong held talks in 1945 in an unsuccessful attempt to create a national unity government ."
2005-05-03,"George Melloan Wall Street Journal , May 3 "" The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , put it well last Friday when he described his Beijing handshake with the Taiwan opposition leader Lien Chan as ' historic ' .
Mr Lien 's party , the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , was the party of Chiang Kai - shek , who ruled China until he and his army fled to Taiwan in 1949 before the advancing forces of Mao Zedong ...
The reconciliation ... put paid to a lot of bad memories ... ""
Mr Lien has lost two presidential elections , in 2000 and 2004 , to the Taiwanese president , Chen Shui - bian , so he has no official standing ...
So the Beijing affair was just a reconciliation of two parties , both with a lurid past .
Mr Hu no doubt thought this heavily publicised media event might serve better to soften up the Taiwanese , and world opinion , than the bare - fisted threats , such as the March anti - secession law , China has used in the past .
"" People 's Daily Editorial , China , April 30 "" The moment of handshake has ... enhanced the self - confidence of all the daughters and sons of the Chinese nation worldwide ...
"" People of the world are still waiting to see whether this time the Taiwan authorities can grasp the good opportunity ...
Whether they can correctly treat the ' common aspirations ' of the KMT and the Communist Party of China , comply with the common wishes of the people on the two sides of the straits for mutual trust and mutual help and a win - win result , and observe the international community 's expectations for peace and stability . ""
China Post Editorial , Taiwan , May 3 ""
Mr Lien 's ... historic eight - day , four - city trip ... is a watershed event that promises to prevent a military confrontation in the Taiwan Strait , shelve the sovereignty dispute between the two sides and direct the island 's domestic politics to be more practical and less ideological Mr Lien is bringing back to Taipei the possibilities of setting up a common market , a framework for peace and stability , including a mechanism for military mutual trust , as well as greater international space for Taiwan .
None is possible under [ Mr Chen 's ] ' secessionist ' government . ""
Liberty Times Editorial , Taiwan , May 3 ""
Mr Lien said his trip was propelled by the backing of strong popular will .
Actually , not only do most people in Taiwan not identify with Mr Lien 's behaviour , they also believe it is shameful the way he is selling out Taiwan ... ""
Mr Lien went to China on what he called a ' journey of peace ' , saying he would help Taiwan counter the negative implications of Beijing 's ' anti - secession ' law .
Yet China responded with the same old pro - unification tune .
Mr Lien ... played Mr Hu 's fool ...
It was truly pathetic to see Mr Lien attempt to sell out the people of Taiwan in this way .
However , in a democracy , the people have the right to decide their own fate .
The people should very clearly demonstrate to Mr Lien just what they think of him .
If he is allowed to get away with this , then this generation will be a laughing stock for the generations to come . ""
Straits Times Editorial , Singapore , May 3 "" What Mr Lien accomplished in his meeting with Mr Hu was to create conditions for substantive , lasting cooperation between the mainland and Taiwan .
Beijing 's offer to form a sort of common market was a brilliant tactical stroke ; it will complete the process of Taiwan 's economic integration ...
[ Mr Chen ] is right in saying Mr Lien had no standing to negotiate with Beijing , but he would be wrong to ignore the signposts to a settlement ...
He ought to reassess the changed calculus and show he is forthcoming about engaging with China . """
2005-05-25,"China gave the president of Uzbekistan , Islam Karimov , a red - carpet welcome and a 21-gun salute yesterday during a visit that cemented Beijing 's support for the government two weeks after its deadly crackdown on protesters . ""
Uzbekistan sees the People 's Republic of China as a reliable partner and friendly neighbour , "" Mr Karimov told the Chinese president , Hu Jintao .
A day earlier , China declared its support for the Uzbek government , which has come under fire for a violent crackdown on demonstrators in the town of Andijan earlier this month .
Witnesses say more than 500 people were killed .
Uzbek authorities say 169 died , most of them "" bandits "" .
China said this was a domestic affair , but backed Mr Karimov 's stand against "" separatism , terrorism and extremism "" ."
2005-05-26,"China welcomed the Uzbek president , Islam Karimov , to a summit meeting yesterday , saying the two countries stood united against terrorism .
With western countries calling for an independent inquiry into the reported killing of hundreds of civilian protesters earlier this month , Mr Karimov received support and gestures of friendship from China .
The Chinese premier , Hu Jintao , called Mr Karimov "" an old friend of the Chinese people "" during a meeting at the Great Hall of the People , China 's parliament . ""
For a long time , you 've made efforts toward friendship with China .
For this , we express high praise , "" Mr Hu told Mr Karimov yesterday .
Mr Karimov responded : "" China is of course one of the world 's most important countries .
We see this visit as a new important stage in bilateral relations . ""
Reuters reported that 14 agreements were signed by the two parties , including a deal for a $ 600 m oil joint venture and a treaty of friendship and cooperation .
The welcome highlighted China 's focus on strategic stability in the former Soviet states of central Asia , a region that Beijing considers a hotbed of Islamic militancy that could spread to its own territory .
Chinese state television showed the two leaders smiling and shaking hands .
Earlier , Chinese officials had met Mr Karimov at the Beijing airport with a red - carpet ceremony and bouquets of flowers . ""
The peace and stability of the area is important to the environment of the border areas in China , "" said Professor Zhan Yao , a central Asia specialist at the Shanghai institute of foreign studies .
The May 13 protests in the eastern city of Andijan were triggered by the trial of Muslim businessmen charged with supporting extremists .
Troops moved in and shooting broke out .
Uzbek opposition groups and human rights activists claim more than 700 people , mostly unarmed civilians , were killed .
If true , that would make it one of the deadliest crackdowns on protesters since the massacre of demonstrators in China 's Tiananmen Square in 1989 .
Mr Karimov 's government put the death toll at 169 and said most were militants .
Tashkent has resisted calls by Nato and the EU for an independent investigation of the events .
The US , which relies on an Uzbek airbase as part of its "" war on terror "" , has also criticised the crackdown and said it hopes for more democracy in Uzbekistan .
The unrest occurred about 120 miles from China 's western region of Xinjiang , which shares Uzbekistan 's Muslim religion and Turkic language roots .
Chinese authorities claim Uighur separatists in the area are fighting for an independent theocratic state and are part of an international terrorist network .
"" East Turkestan separatists have carried out a lot of terrorist incidents in China .
The Uzbekistan side fully understands and supports the Chinese government 's stance on this issue , "" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , Kong Quan .
He said that China 's leaders "" firmly support the efforts by the authorities of Uzbekistan to strike down the three forces of terrorism , separatism and extremism "" .
While the three - day visit was a courtesy trip scheduled after Mr Hu visited Tashkent last year , it gave Mr Karimov a way to underline that China is on his side .
"" This is a good opportunity for President Karimov , "" said Joshua Lung , an assistant research fellow at the institute of international relations in Taiwan 's National Chengchi University .
"" He 's facing international pressure , but in China or Russia , he will get the support he needs . """
2005-06-17,"The US increased pressure on China to free an American - based academic who has been jailed on spying charges , with 40 senators , including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton , writing to President Hu Jintao yesterday demanding his immediate release .
Yang Jianli , a veteran of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests , was arrested in 2002 after entering China on a friend 's passport and travelling for a week on a fake identity card to observe labour unrest in the north - east .
He was sentenced to five years ' jail in May last year .
"" We strongly urge your government to use its discretion , in accordance with Chinese law , to release Dr Yang , "" the senators said in a letter emailed to Reuters by the group Freedom Now , which has represented Dr Yang 's family since his detention .
"" We believe a decision to release Dr Yang would be welcomed by all those who seek to improve the bilateral relationship between the United States and China . ""
The signatories also included Elizabeth Dole and Edward Kennedy .
Dr Yang 's wife , Christina Fu , said his health was poor and that she was hopeful the political pressure would pay off .
"" I feel very encouraged by this very strong support , "" she said from Boston .
"" I am optimistic , very hopeful that my husband will be granted medical parole . ""
Jared Genser , of Freedom
Now , said he hoped Dr Yang would be freed before Mr Hu visits the United States in September .
Liu Jianchao , a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing , said China attached importance to the letter , but disputed Ms Fu 's claim that her husband 's health was poor and said his term was not up for another two years .
"" We have also communicated with the US side , including US senators , on relevant questions , "" he told a news conference .
"" Such communications are frequent and are conducive to enhancing the understanding between the two sides .
However , the Chinese side will still handle relevant questions according to law .
"" The letter expressed concern over Dr Yang 's health , saying he was allegedly beaten and tortured by prison guards , but his requests to see his lawyer to file charges had been denied .
The detention and poor treatment of Dr Yang , 41 , contradicted China 's claim , in a report on its own human rights , that they had brought violations by government officials under control , the letter said .
China said yesterday that a prominent sociologist and an official from the country 's leading government thinktank had been detained earlier this year on suspicion of leaking state secrets .
Unidentified sources had first reported the detentions of Lu Jianhua , a sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( Cass ) , and Chen Hui , an assistant to the director of the Cass general office , earlier this month .
They are the latest in a series of intellectuals , reporters and dissidents held behind bars in China .
Mr Lu had ties to Ching Cheong , a Hong Kong - based reporter for Singapore 's Straits Times newspaper , who was detained on April 22 ."
2005-06-17,"The revelation that China 's army of censors and monitors of the media and the internet have been instructed to intervene in internet discussions under false names and lead the discussion toward the sort of conclusions of which the party would approve is an index of the desperation of the authorities .
Mere excision or suppression , of which there has been and still is plenty , is apparently no longer enough .
Now the debates arising among the nearly l00 million net users in China are to be infiltrated by cultural double agents who will pipe up with encomiums of President Hu Jintao or attempt to change the subject from Tibet to the benefits to be expected from the Three Gorges Dam .
Even if the operatives are more subtle than that , it is a safe bet that most will soon be spotted and become chat room pariahs .
When Hu first took over he made quasi - liberal noises about free expression and debate , which led people to expect , if not a transformation of the media and communications scene , at least some improvement .
But he has proceeded in the opposite direction .
A sophisticated filter system , triggered by words such as "" democracy "" , continually sweeps Chinese internet space clean , and has been refined and intensified under Hu .
Yahoo and now Microsoft have , in the words of a statement from Reporters Without Borders , "" given way to the Chinese authorities and agreed to self - censorship "" on the same lines .
The latest twist is that all websites and weblogs are to be required to register , with real names and identity numbers , on the "" we know where you live "" principle that the people concerned can be identified and punished in the event that dangerous thoughts get an airing .
Some are ready to confront that approach directly , like Wang Yi , a radical writer and internet essayist on legal subjects , who is suing for the return of books he had privately published and which the authorities then confiscated .
Wang does n't expect to win but he does expect to embarrass - and to log everything that happens to him on the net .
Part of the transition from simply suppressing debate to trying to manage it in China is the effort to establish , or re - establish , the idea that everybody and everything is under surveillance .
The problem the authorities face , however , is that Chinese society has moved beyond the point where systematic punishment is possible , because the numbers involved in debate , especially on the internet , are just too large , and because some clear limits on what even a Chinese government can do to its own citizens have begun to emerge ."
2005-07-27,"Robert Mugabe is having a whale of a time on his state visit to China .
The Zimbabwean president has been made an honorary professor and praised by Hu Jintao , the prime minister , as "" a familiar and much respected old friend of the Chinese people "" .
This is uncomfortable for the 700,000 Zimbabweans who have been made homeless in massive "" slum clearance "" programmes , the United Nations , and much of the rest of the world - apart , most significantly , from neighbouring South Africa - who see Mr Mugabe as a pariah who should be shunned rather than given the red carpet treatment he is getting in Beijing .
If this welcome was purely ceremonial it might matter less .
But a new trade agreement with China and promises of soft loans and investment will help Mr Mugabe with his policy of "" looking east "" - adopted because the west has finally run out of patience with him .
Both the EU and the US have imposed limited sanctions targeting the Zanu - PF regime because of its land seizures , rigged elections and other human rights abuses .
The International Monetary Fund is to decide soon whether or not to axe Zimbabwe from its list of eligible borrowers .
China makes much of its "" peaceful rise "" , despite sabre - rattling over Taiwan , but in this case it is using its growing economic clout to give succour to a regime which does not deserve it .
And it is part of a wider strategy .
China says little about its pursuit of African markets for its goods and supplies of rare minerals but regularly flaunts its "" principled "" refusal to intervene in Zimbabwe 's internal affairs - just as it rejects outsiders ' interference in its own .
And this is just days after the UN angrily condemned the "" urban resettlement "" scheme - seen as a transparent attempt to crush a stronghold of the opposition MDC , in which more than 220,000 children have lost their homes in two months .
Unicef reports children dying of easily treatable respiratory infections and of women being forced to give birth in the open .
Yesterday Professor Mugabe was emboldened to claim that Beijing would now back Zimbabwe in preventing the matter from being formally debated in the UN security council , as Britain and the US are rightly insisting it should .
China has already played a role in blocking council action on the mass killings in Darfur because of its oil interests in Sudan and elsewhere in Africa .
It would be a harbinger of other difficulties to come if its traditional passivity in the council - where its habit is to abstain rather than wield its veto - were to give way to more active defence of the indefensible ."
2005-07-27,"President Robert Mugabe found a sanctuary from international criticism in Beijing yesterday as the Chinese government gave him an economic deal that is expected to provide Zimbabwe with desperately needed funds .
The cooperation agreement signed with the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , reflects a strengthening alliance between Mr Mugabe , who has adopted a "" look east "" policy to circumvent western critics , and the government in Beijing , which is strengthening its presence in Africa to secure energy , minerals and other commodities to fuel what is the world 's fastest growing economy .
Few details of the deal were released , but China 's Xinhua news agency reported that Beijing would provide economic and technical support in several areas , including help to finance construction of a power plant and the sale of a 60-seater plane to Harare .
Mr Mugabe 's spokesman has previously said that Zimbabwe would also ask China for the expansion and extension of lines of credit to deal with triple - digit inflation and foreign debts of $ 4.5bn ( £ 2.5bn ) .
At a time when he is treated as a pariah in Europe and the US and by many international organisations , Mr Mugabe is keen to deepen diplomatic and economic relations with China .
Beijing , which is thought to be interested in Zimbabwe 's reserves of platinum and other minerals , has been more than willing to offer moral and financial support .
"" You have made major contributions to the friendly relations between our two countries , "" Mr Hu said at the start of the meeting yesterday .
Relations have strengthened steadily since Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 , but the pace has accelerated rapidly in recent years .
Bilateral trade hit $ 100 m in the first three months of this year and Beijing has started to replace the west as a source of capital to such an extent that Mr Mugabe says China will soon be the country 's leading foreign investor .
Some of the biggest deals have seen China supply hydro - electric generators for the national power authority , training jets for the air force , planes for the national airline and thousands of commuter buses .
According to the New York Times , China also won a contract last year to farm 386 square miles of land seized from white farmers in 2000 .
The roof of Mr Mugabe 's new £ 7.4 m palace is covered with Chinese tiles donated by Beijing ; in return , the president has been exhorting his population to study Mandarin and try Chinese food .
China yesterday conferred an honorary professorship on Mr Mugabe from the Foreign Affairs University , under the auspices of the Chinese foreign ministry .
"" It is in recognition of the outstanding research and remarkable contribution in the work of diplomacy and international relations by his excellency , "" An Yongyu , Communist party secretary of the university , was quoted as saying by the China Daily .
"" People know very well that the president is a man of strong will and achievements , a man safeguarding world peace . ""
Mr Mugabe 's visit came as the UN yesterday launched a campaign to provide urgent aid to 700,000 Zimbabweans made homeless or jobless by housing demolitions .
Unicef urged the Harare government to immediately halt the destruction of homes .
UN officials said that the demolitions were continuing in eastern Zimbabwe despite claims by the government that it had ended the drive .
Unicef also appealed to the government for unhindered access to provide aid to the uprooted families .
The Unicef effort follows the damning report on Mr Mugabe 's sweeping drive to tear down the homes of the urban poor by the UN 's special envoy , Anna Tibaijuka .
James Elder , Unicef spokesman in Harare , said Zimbabwe had "" the world 's fourth highest rate of HIV infection , the world 's fastest rising child mortality rate , drastic economic decline and a growing food emergency .
It is just too much .
That is why we are working to help . """
2005-09-01,"The Chinese communist party is reprogramming history with the development of a new internet game that encourages players to slaughter Japanese invaders in simulations of battles of the 1930s and 40s .
"" Anti - Japan War Online "" is being sponsored by the Communist Youth League , the power base of president Hu Jintao , in order to foster greater patriotism among the fast - growing internet game community .
Players choose from a range of 17 Chinese characters - peasant , worker , student , tailor - that they must develop from childhood into strong figures worthy of joining the communist guerrilla forces .
Advanced players are promoted to the Eighth Route Army - the militia that served under General Zhu De in a series of successful raids on depots and supply convoys behind enemy lines in the north of China during the second world war .
Players are not allowed to take the part of Japanese soldiers .
To distinguish the two sides , developers said they had made the appearance of Japanese soldiers more ugly , but they have scaled down the battle scenes so that the fighting is not excessively bloodthirsty .
Such compromises have been the source of internal quarrels .

2005-09-01,"Washington yesterday imposed curbs on two further types of Chinese textile imports , only hours after talks aimed at settling a simmering trade dispute ended in failure .
The inability to reach a compromise in attempts to slow the surge of Chinese clothing entering the United States underlines a growing friction between the two countries .
Chinese president Hu Jintao is making a visit to the White House next week in the hope of defusing the tension arising from trade issues , Beijing 's growing military strength , political issues like Taiwan and its increasing energy needs .
The talks in Beijing ended early yesterday after three days of brokering .
In a statement , US delegation leader David Spooner said : "" Despite our best efforts we were not able to reach a broader agreement . ""
He said the two sides would discuss a venue in the next few days for a fresh round of talks .
Chinese exports have surged since quotas governing worldwide textile sales were abolished at the start of the year .
American manufacturers claim 19 factories have been forced to close since January , at the cost of 26,000 jobs .
The US trade deficit with China last year reached a record $ 162bn ( £ 88.6bn ) .
The deficit this year is running 32 % higher , due chiefly to a 58 % jump in clothing and textile imports .
A parallel trade dispute in Europe has blocked the import of about 80 m items of clothing .
EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson yesterday urged European governments to allow the stockpiled clothing into their countries .
"" I maintain my insistence that goods held at the border must be unblocked and I hope member states will accept this , and I expect them to do so , "" he said .
Mr Mandelson has argued that most of the goods were ordered before a June agreement imposing new limits on imports .
EU talks were expected to continue today .
The US commerce department said it had decided to place limits on the importation of bras and synthetic filament fabrics .
It will make a decision about whether to impose additional restrictions on imports of jumpers , dressing gowns , wool trousers and knit fabrics on October 1 .
The restrictions , known as safeguards , are being implemented under World Trade Organisation rules to ensure the orderly development of trade .
They cap import growth at an annual 7.5 % ."
2005-09-14,"The US administration has embarked on a series of face - to - face meetings with world leaders at the UN summit to try to isolate Iran diplomatically over Iran 's push to expand its nuclear programme .
George Bush met Hu Jintao , the Chinese leader , on Tuesday and will hold talks with Vladimir Putin , Russia 's president , tomorrow in an attempt to secure their support for referring Iran to the UN security council , a move that could see sanctions imposed on Tehran .
The Chinese leader refused to commit himself .
In support of Mr Bush 's diplomatic drive , US officials have delivered hour - long PowerPoint briefings , entitled A History of Concealment and Deception , to diplomats from at least a dozen countries .
The officials making the presentation , which includes satellite photographs of Iran 's nuclear installations , admit they can not say definitively that Tehran is covertly trying to secure a nuclear weapons capability .
Iran has repeatedly denied it has any ambition to build a nuclear weapon and claims it only wants a civilian nuclear programme .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's new president , is due to make a speech at the UN summit today , his first major international outing since his surprise election in June .
He said before leaving Iran that he would tell the UN : "" All nations should be allowed to use different kinds of energies , including nuclear . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad is also holding a series of bilateral talks with other leaders to try to win support .
Iranian officials have been hinting for weeks that their delegation to the summit will offer a new set of proposals , possibly suggesting that the two - year - long talks between Iran and the European Union trio of Britain , France and Germany be expanded to include the US , Russia and China .
Iran has good relations with the latter two , both of which are big importers of Iranian oil .
As well as security council members , Mr Bush is targeting the 35 board members of the International Atomic Energy Authority , the UN nuclear watchdog which on Monday will consider referral to the security council .
The PowerPoint presentations have been held at the US mission in Vienna , headquarters of the IAEA .
The US has long called on Iran to drop its nuclear programme altogether , even for non - military purposes , but Mr Bush on Tuesday accepted that Iran had the right to pursue a civilian programme .
"" Some of us are wondering why they need civilian nuclear power anyway .
They 're awash with hydrocarbons .
Nevertheless , it 's a right of a government to want to have a civilian nuclear programme . ""
But Iran should not be allowed to gain the technical skill that would enable it to make weapons .
"" This is a subject of grave concern , and it 's something that we 're spending a lot of time on in this administration .
It is very important for the world to understand that Iran with a nuclear weapon will be incredibly destabilising . ""
Nicholas Burns , US undersecretary of state for political affairs , said Iran was probably the most important issue being discussed on the sidelines of the summit ."
2005-09-26,"China announced a fresh crackdown yesterday on the internet amid further revelations of a plan by Hu Jintao , the president , to suppress dissent .
"" The state bans the spreading of any news with content that is against national security and public interest , "" said a statement from Xinhua , the official news agency .
The announcement called for blogs and personal web pages to "" be directed towards serving the people and socialism and insist on correct guidance of public opinion for maintaining national and public interests "" .
The statement was just one of a series of initiatives by the government to root out politically sensitive news from domestic and foreign media .
On Thursday a Chinese journalist and former professor was given a seven - year sentence for "" inciting subversion "" by writing hundreds of articles for banned overseas news websites .
Last month the government tried to implement a scheme to pay journalists according to how much Communist party officials liked , or disliked , their articles .
In July a political activist was given five years for posting a punk song on the internet deemed to be subversive , and in April a journalist was sentenced to 10 years for sending an email overseas about restrictions on freedom of speech .
Providing further evidence of an organised national crackdown , the New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Hu called for a "" smokeless war "" against "" liberal elements "" in China during a secret leadership meeting in May.
The government employs a cyberspace police rumoured to number 30,000 and has spent lavishly on internet filters .
Journalists and human rights organisations say the "" smokeless war "" amounts to a transformation of the government 's tactics from violence , open harassment and the closing of newspapers to more covert methods of maintaining control .
Journalists who try write on forbidden topics are rarely attacked directly , but are discredited by charges such as corruption , sexual harassment and extramarital affairs .
They claim confiscation of notes , address books and mobile phones happen secretly beneath a facade that nothing is wrong , so as to defend the image of the party and its leaders .
"" They are trying to safeguard the welfare of the regime , while simultaneously providing for the illusion of a free liberal press , "" said Law Yuk - kai of the Hong Kong - based Human Rights Monitor .
"" But the internet provides a new way to organise people and is therefore a mounting threat to the government . ""
With a growing income gap and agitated unions , migrant workers and students , Mr Law said the government was feeling increasingly threatened by any media that provide outlets for expression of dissent .
"" They are in a bind .
On the one hand they want to encourage economic development but on the other hand they want to strangle any political initiatives by those not benefiting from the new China . ""
While many governments prevent the free flow of controversial information by simply banning the internet altogether , China 's strategy has been one of controlled welcome - exploiting the internet 's phenomenal potential to drive China 's its globalised economy while simultaneously suppressing its potential for freedom of expression .
The current struggle in the Chinese media began in the 1990s when the government cut funding to various media outlets , forcing them to engage in a balancing act between encouraging circulation [ through genuine news ] and servicing the propaganda department [ as most media are required to do ] .
"" When [ former president ] Jiang Zemin came to power , the propaganda department began controlling all Chinese media , "" said one high - ranking editor of a party - run newspaper with close government connections .
""
After Hu Jintao became president , there was an effort to open up .
But after about six months the central government started getting complaints from local officials about their inability to govern because of media reports exposing corruption in their administrations ...
everything reversed- there was a big policy change back to the way things were . ""
The editor told the Guardian that the row in the party centred on the president 's lack of authority over local leaders .
Yesterday China gambled with a goodwill gesture to pro - democracy members of Hong Kong 's legislature , inviting them to mainland China for the first time in more than 15 years .
But the visit appeared to backfire when at least one member of the group wore a T - shirt with a picture of tanks in Tiananmen square , a symbol of the 1989 pro - democracy protests in which hundreds of students were killed .
Background China has built the most sophisticated government - controlled internet on earth , often hailed as "" the Great Firewall "" .
With the help of western technology firms and internet companies , China filters foreign sites , restricts blog postings , limits online chats and censors instant messages for the second - largest online population in the world .
While the barriers are easy to get around with a bit of techno - wizardry , journalists , editors , internet service providers and cybercafe owners are all under heavy pressure to abide by the rules and to self - censor to stay in business .
The experience can frustrate - thousands of sites are blocked , emails can just disappear and even search engines will not turn up results for certain words .
Banned phrases from news sites , blogs and instant messaging services include independence , democracy , Taiwan , Tiananmen Square , freedom and the Dalai Lama"
2005-10-20,"Hopes for political reform in China have suffered a setback with the publication of the government 's first white paper on democracy - a document that despite its name reaffirmed the Communist party 's determination to cling to power and postpone the introduction of elections .
The white paper was issued by the cabinet amid rising tensions in the countryside and calls from western leaders for Beijing to adjust its archaic system of governance so that it keeps pace with the spectacular changes in the economy .
But initial optimism that President Hu Jintao and the prime minister , Wen Jiabao , might be any more willing than their predecessors to implement political reform were dashed by the 12-part document , which defined China as a "" democratic dictatorship "" in which the Communist party had been chosen by history to play a leading role .
The paper acknowledged that the system is "" not yet perfect "" , highlighting the problems of corruption and the failure sometimes to implement laws and punish lawbreakers .
But it offered no specific policy proposals nor a timetable for change .
There was no mention of media freedom , despite the increasingly apparent need for democratic checks and balances on abuse of authority .
Electoral reform was also pushed into the background .
Last month Mr Wen told Tony Blair that China was moving to permit township - level elections , which would for the first time allow voters to choose policymakers responsible for budget issues such as education .
But there was nothing in the paper to suggest that this would happen soon .
"" This is simply a rehash of previous policy statements , "" said a western political analyst in Beijing , who asked to remain nameless .
"" It 's a declaration that the Communist party intends to stay very firmly in control . ""
Political and legal reforms have slowed even as the economy surges ahead .
New figures yesterday showed that China 's gross domestic product grew by 9.4 % between January and September .
Rising lifestyle expectations , better public understanding of human rights and the spread of internet and mobile phone technology have fuelled a grassroots movement for bureaucrats to be more accountable for their decisions .
But the Communist party has made social stability its overriding concern , conscious of the chaos that followed political reform in Russia .
Critical newspaper editors have been arrested , dissidents are frequently put under house arrest and censorship of the internet has been stepped up .
Local governments , who often face challenges from their residents , appear to have been given a free hand to use extra - legal means to put down disputes .
In one of the highest profile cases an impeachment campaign by residents in Taishi village , Guangdong province , was broken up by hired thugs , who have beaten up residents , civil rights campaigners and journalists .
According to a new report on the attacks by the South China Morning Post , one member of almost every household in Taishi was arrested and told they would be imprisoned for at least three years until their families gave up the challenge against the village chief .
The newspaper said the central government had declared Taishi an "" important political incident "" - making it the same level of concern as the Sars outbreak and the Falun Gong movement .
Chinese policymakers argue that stability is the basis for gradual reform .
"" We need time , "" said Wu Jianmin , president of the Foreign Affairs University and a former ambassador .
"" At some point , things will move on . """
2005-11-07,"With MPs last week debating whether the government 's new anti - terrorism bill , and its clause about outlawing the "" glorification "" of terrorism , would mean that their teenage Che Guevera T - shirts could get them banged up ( presuming they could still fit into them ) , it will come as a reassurance that the prime minister today declared it was OK to wear a Free Tibet T - shirt in the Mall on Wednesday , when the Chinese president Hu Jintao arrives on a state visit .
When Mr Hu 's predecessor , Jian Zemin , visited London in October 1999 , a diplomatic row ensued after several protesters complained that their pro - Tibet banners were seized by police before they had even unveiled them .
Two protesters carrying Tibetan flags were seized by police when they mounted the barricade , albeit before President Zemin 's convoy passed by .
The then home office minister , Paul Boateng , denied rumours the government had put pressure on the Met to clamp down on peaceful protests highlighting China 's human rights record , but , in the high court six months later , the Met was forced to apologise for pre - emptively removing pro - democracy placards and for positioning police vans where they may have blocked the president 's sight of protesters .
Quizzed today by the London Evening Standard as to whether there would be a repeat of such forceful policing , the PM was categorical : "" People are perfectly entitled to wear Free Tibet T - shirts or anything else .
"" We live in a free , democratic country ...

"" But he seemed less than eager to press Mr Hu on China 's human rights record himself .

We will discuss , of course , the current security preoccupations in the world and how we cooperate better on the security council .
"" We will discuss issues to do with climate change , where the Chinese have taken part very constructively in the G8-plus - five dialogue last week .
It will give me an opportunity to hear from the president as to how economic and political development is progressing in China . ""

2005-11-08,"A royal reception from the Queen and more raucous displays from pro - Tibet and democracy activists today greeted the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , on his arrival in central London .
Shortly after the Queen , the Duke of Edinburgh and Tony Blair met Mr Hu and his wife at Horse Guards Parade , the presidential convoy passed through opposing lines of pro- and anti - Chinese government demonstrators as it completed the journey to Buckingham Palace along the Mall .
Alison Reynolds , director of the Free Tibet Campaign , said she was pleased with the turnout .
"" I think there was a very noisy reception for Hu Jintao .
I hope he will have seen the demonstrators as he processed down the Mall . ""
Included in his itinerary on the three - day state visit are a banquet at Buckingham Palace and talks with Mr Blair .
The London Eye and Somerset House , both overlooking the Thames , are among several central London landmarks to be bathed in red lights tonight to mark the visit .
The Queen also dressed in deep red to greet the president .
But Mr Hu will not be so respectfully welcomed by human rights activists , who have pledged to dog him with protests over the one - party state 's treatment of political dissidents and the outlawed Falun Gong movement , and its occupation of Tibet .
The president was previously Communist party chief in Tibet where he responded ruthlessly to separatists ' protests by declaring martial law .
He last week called on the Dalai Lama to "" renounce his Tibetan independence proposition "" .
When Jiang Zemin , Mr Hu 's predecessor , visited London in 1999 , heavy - handed policing was used to keep demonstrators out of view .
Today , while security was tight , the yellow , blue and red Tibetan flags were not taken away from the protesters .
Prince Charles , a long - time supporter of the Dalai Lama , was accused of boycotting the last state visit when he failed to attend the banquet for Mr Jiang .
The timing of his flight back from the United States means he will be unable to attend tonight 's banquet for Mr Hu .
Mr Blair was yesterday urged by the campaign group Amnesty International to raise human rights issues during his talks with Mr Hu .
Stephen Bowen , Amnesty 's UK campaign director , said China 's economic progress should not "" blind "" the UK to the denial of basic rights . ""
China still massively restricts freedom of expression and information , still executes more people than the rest of the world put together and still harasses and detains people who stand up for human rights , "" he said .
Mr Blair , who on his last visit to China said the country had "" an unstoppable momentum "" towards democracy , told a Downing Street press conference that the talks would give him "" an opportunity also to hear from the president as to how economic and political development is progressing in China "" .
He will attempt to boost British economic interests in China and win Beijing 's support for the European Union in its dispute with Iran over its nuclear programme .
Mr Hu will also meet the Liberal Democrat and Conservative leaders , Charles Kennedy and Michael Howard respectively .
Menzies Campbell , foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , said Mr Kennedy would be raising human rights issues "" firmly but respectfully "" when he met the Chinese president .
Adam Ward , an Asia analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , told Bloomberg that China was now "" an actor on the international security stage "" and there was now a realisation that trade , security and human rights were linked .
The visit comes as the eastern nation builds its links to the west , despite unease over its lack of democratic reforms .

2005-11-09,"Noisy protests took place outside Downing Street today as Tony Blair held talks with the Chinese president , Hu Jintao .
Crowds waving Tibetan flags shouted demands for the communist authorities to pull out of the Himalayan region .
As in the Mall yesterday , the Free Tibet campaigners faced a rival group of Mr Hu supporters , who waved Chinese flags as the president , his wife Liu Yongqing , and a considerable entourage swept into Downing Street to be met on the steps of No 10 by Mr Blair and his wife , Cherie .
"" Our specific message to Tony Blair is for him to ask Hu Jintao to meet the Dalai Lama , "" said Alison Reynolds of the Free Tibet Campaign .
"" We are raising a whole series of other issues as well , such as the treatment of political prisoners and media freedom around the Olympic games . ""
What we would like to see is Tony Blair making a public statement of concern over these issues .
"" China 's highly criticised human rights ' record was unlikely to be top of Mr Blair 's list at today 's discussions .
Earlier this week he said that they were likely to discuss the growing economic relations between the two countries , better co - operation on the security council and climate change .
In Downing Street , the leaders looked on as executives from companies including Lloyd 's of London , Airbus and Rolls Royce signed contracts worth £ 747 m with Chinese firms .
The prime minister was among some 160 guests at a state banquet for Mr Hu at Buckingham palace last night .
The Queen told Mr Hu in a speech that China 's growth brought difficult challenges but also great opportunities .
"" It matters to all of us what kind of country China 's people will build , what role they will play in the world of the 21st century and how this will be perceived by others , "" she said .
"" China 's growth brings with it difficult challenges for you and your government but also great opportunities .
We must continue to move forward in a partnership which remains comprehensive , strategic and productive .
"" The Queen added that the UK and China were able to work together on issues such as global warming .
Mr Hu , who is staying at the palace during his three - day state visit , said his country stood ready to work with Britain to strengthen mutual trust .
This afternoon the Chinese leader joined the Queen for the inauguration of the Royal Academy of Arts ' new landmark exhibition China :
The Three Emperors 1662 - 1795 .
Many of the 400 works come from imperial collections at Beijing 's Palace Museum and have never been seen outside China .
The focus is on the artistic and cultural riches of the three most powerful emperors of China 's last dynasty , the Kangxi emperor ( 1662 - 1722 ) , the Yongzheng emperor ( 1723 - 35 ) and the Qianlong emperor ( 1736 - 95 ) ."
2005-11-09,"It 's a busy day on the political front , with Jack Straw and Gordon Brown hotfooting it back to Westminster from foreign trips in an attempt to bolster Labour 's vote on this afternoon 's terror bill , as the government faces possibly the first defeat of Tony Blair 's premiership .

2005-11-09,"As he was swept through Canada Gate and into Buckingham Palace in a gilded carriage drawn by six white horses yesterday morning , the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , could have been forgiven for feeling a little confused .
On one side of the Mall a crowd of a few hundred largely silent supporters waved the red flag of China and held out banners saying , "" Welcome leader of the motherland "" .
Just metres away , on the other side of the Mall , a much more boisterous but similarly sized crowd chanted , "" China , China , Out , Out "" amid a blizzard of Tibetan flags in red , yellow and blue .
( There was trouble during Jiang Zemin 's state visit in 1999 when police stopped protesters carrying the Tibetan flag , banned in China , but this time a lighter touch was applied . )
Perhaps it was fitting that the president of China should be greeted by such a polarised response at the start of his first official visit to the UK , which lasts until tomorrow : the community of 400,000 or so people of Chinese and Tibetan origin living in Britain is nothing if not divided on the subject .
Over on the angry side of the road , Tseten Samdup , a Tibetan protester wearing a Free Tibet placard around his waist , said he had come to demand an end to the 55-year Chinese occupation of his country . ""
The Chinese government should start negotiations with Dalai Lama and free our political prisoners , "" he said .
Mr Tseten 's parents fled Tibet in 1959 as Chinese rule tightened .
He grew up in a refugee camp in Nepal and then India .
"" I have never seen my country .
But I have become aware of what 's been done to Tibet through my contact with Tibetans who have been imprisoned for over three decades . ""
Mr Hu last visited the UK in 2001 as Chinese vice - president and heir apparent .
He was appointed leader of the Chinese Communist party in 2002 , president in 2003 , and his power was finally affirmed when he took over control of the Central Military Commission in 2004 at the age of 61 .
He has a cultivated and liberal image , but Tibetan exiles have long memories .
Mr Hu presided over the imposition of martial law in Tibet in 1988 as party secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region , during which thousands of Tibetan protesters were killed .
They also remember that he sent a congratulatory telegram to Deng Xiaoping in 1989 for his handling of the upheaval in Tiananmen Square .
The exiled Chinese writer Ma Jian , the author of the banned novel Noodle Maker which is a powerful critique of the Chinese market economy , was among yesterday 's protesters . ""
Now we are at the lowest point in the development of democracy in China .
Newspaper offices are regularly raided and journalists jailed .
The Chinese media have been silenced , "" he said .
"" Currently , 42 of our members of the Independent Writers Society are in prison on charges of so - called national interest and national security .
Hu 's visit is all about the exchange of interests and the concern is economics rather than human beings . ""
Quite a different picture was painted on the other side of the Mall .
This crowd consisted of people who are beginning to enjoy the benefit of a booming Chinese economy and show it in the cut of their suits .
For them , Mr Hu represents the success to which they aspire as well as national pride .
Xie Gui - quan , the managing director of the UK supermarket chain See Woo , said the visit was "" a great thing "" . ""
A growing new China is our pride .
It 's a great thing for all of us that Hu is visiting . ""
Mr Xie arrived in Britain in 1961 from Hong Kong , hoping to set up his own business and do well abroad .
"" It was really tough in those days .
My first job was as a chef in a Chinese kitchen in the Midlands , working in the dark for 12 hours a day , £ 8 a week .
Those were four long years . ""
He worked hard , saved and in 1964 set up his own restaurant .
Expansion followed rapidly , and in 1975 he started the supermarket .
Now he employs about 300 people .
Despite his established status in Britain , he still considers China as home . ""
Chinese people should be proud .
My country is growing very fast , it is changing .
We should n't dwell in the past . ""
By now , Mr Hu had finished his inspection of the footguards in Horse Guards Parade and was on to a brief private lunch at the palace .
The Queen , it was later announced , presented him with a pair of silver picture frames with photos of herself and her husband .
Perfect for the bedside .
While these formalities took place , it was business as usual a few miles away in Soho , the centre of British - Chinese community life .
When asked about Mr Hu 's visit , Thomas Chan , the chairman of the Chinese Takeaway Association , replied : "" We have to work .
No time for the parade . ""
Round the corner in Lisle Street in the middle of Chinatown , Chinese workers were unpacking boxes of fish balls at See Woo .
Huang Jian - zhong , a worker from Shanghai , said : "" Hu Jintao 's visit is not my concern .
It makes no difference to our lives . ""
His fellow worker Zhou added : "" If I say we despise Mr Hu , we 'll be in trouble ; but if I say he is our hero , would you believe it ? ""
Mr Huang , who has worked in Britain for five years doing low - paid jobs , said : "" Hu and the government does nothing for us .
Who can help me when I have to work nine hours a day for not very much , and may get dismissed anytime ? ""
He paused , and then added : "" All I know is that capitalism is cruel .
It is cruel in China and it 's cruel here . """
2005-11-09,"Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , will experience plenty of pomp and ceremony during his state visit to Britain , the first stop on a European tour that reflects the growing weight of the People 's Republic on the global stage .
Protocol dictates a banquet at Buckingham Palace , guards of honour and floodlit monuments .
But the agenda for talks with Tony Blair shows the vast range of issues on which Beijing now matters to the entire world .
The most substantial of these are China 's staggering 9 % economic growth and its ravenous hunger for resources from oil to steel .
There is also the environmental damage caused by its expanding industries and military spending that is jangling nerves from Tokyo and Taipei to Washington as they watch the much - vaunted "" peaceful rise "" of the country that will dominate the 21st century .
China 's rapid transition from peasant communism to throbbing market Leninism is also fuelling massive social dislocation and a consumer boom with implications for democracy , freedom and the rule of law .
Its record on human rights , at home and Tibet , is a cause of profound concern .
The agenda , all in all , is so varied and all - embracing that only small parts of it can be touched on briefly , let alone covered , in two very formal days in London .
Nevertheless , one of the purposes of such setpiece diplomacy is to set the tone for relations between host and guest : since Mr Blair is also the current president of the European Union , this is an encounter between leaders who represent 1.3bn and 450 m people respectively .
That is why it is so important to stick to the EU arms embargo imposed after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 .
To lift it now , as France and Germany would dearly like , would send the wrong message to Beijing .
China needs to be aware , as the demonstrators greeting Mr Hu on the Mall made clear yesterday - thankfully without the disgracefully heavy - handed policing that marked Jiang Zemin 's state visit in 1999 - that it is not at liberty to murder or harass its own citizens with impunity , nor rattle sabres across the Taiwan strait .
Media and internet censorship , executions , the arrest of dissidents , and persecution of the Falun Gong and Christian groups can not be ignored .
It is hard to accept that such concerns should only be raised in private , as Downing Street insists is right .
It is hard too to believe Mr Hu will be moved by Joanna Lumley 's plea that he meet the Dalai Lama .
Experts are right to point out that it is important to see opportunities as well as threats .
Self - interest means binding China as tightly as possible into the world economy to facilitate foreign investment , improve labour standards , curb counterfeit goods and encourage good governance .
The recent "" bra wars "" over Chinese textile imports to Europe were a reminder of the sheer disruptive potential of this turbocharged market .
Progress on the environment requires intensive cooperation .
Britain and the EU are already helping China to develop a power plant that captures carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and stores it underground .
Much more needs to be done .
Chinese muscle - it is expected to be the world 's second largest economy by 2020 - is also being converted into other potentially destabilising forms of power .
Its raw material and energy needs dictate what has been called a "" morality - free "" foreign policy that has led it to block UN moves to deal with the crisis in Darfur , and to indulge Zimbabwe and Iran .
Its clout in Asia has given it a key role in seeking to curb North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
President George Bush 's visit later this month will be a reminder of the importance Washington still attaches to a prickly relationship .
With Hong Kong out of the way , Britain 's bilateral relations with China are trouble - free .
Mr Blair has to speak for Europe when he speaks to Mr Hu today .
Rolling out the red carpet is fine , but embracing the dragon is never going to be easy ."
2005-11-09,"Preamble :
Tony Blair faces another difficult questions today ahead of this afternoon 's crunch vote on the terror bill .
The chief whip , Hilary Armstrong , has ordered both Jack Straw and Gordon Brown to return to the House of Commons from foreign trips , suggesting the result will be extremely close .
PMQs also comes in the middle of the state visit by the Chinese president , Hu Jintao .
With many Labour MPs concerned about human rights in China , the prime minister will expect questions about his conversations with the communist leader .
Midday :
The Labour backbencher Gordon Marsden begins the session by asking Tony Blair about funding for adult education .
Michael Howard starts by saying everyone in the house wants action on the new terrorist threat and angrily reminds Mr Blair that some on the Conservative benches "" fought terrorism on the streets of Northern Ireland "" .
He then asks if government changes to the bill had improved it .
Mr Blair replies that changes have been made to help reach a compromise .
He tells the house that the 90-day detention proposal did n't originate with the government but the police .
The PM then quotes the chief constable of Manchester , who said the threat was "" horrendous "" and required early arrests .
During a response , the PM stops to ask if a Tory MP has shouted "" police state "" at him and then replies : "" We are not living in police state but in a country that faces a real and serious threat of terrorism . ""
Mr Howard reminds the PM about his past statements on terrorism and the police .

Mr Blair tells Mr Howard that the police recently prevented a terrorist attack .
He explains that the sunset clause should be used to review the operation of the law .
He says the government wants to back the police .
Mr Howard responds that there was n't a single terrorist case where a 90-day detention was necessary .
He asks Mr Blair if can name a case .
Mr Blair tells him to read the report by Andy Hayman from the anti - terrorist unit , explaining why 90 days is necessary .
He tells the house to have a "" sense of responsibility "" in this case and do what is necessary to protect the country .
We all want to fight terrorism effectively , replies Mr Howard , who then seems to refer to the riots in France as evidence of what happens when minority communities are alienated .
What would 90-day detention do to those communities , he asks .
Mr Blair warns there could be mass casualties on the streets and asks Mr Howard if the Conservative party really wants to go against the advice of the police .
Mr Howard again asks why 90 days in particular and reminds Mr Blair of the words of the home secretary when he indicated he would reduce the proposed detention period .
He then asks why Charles Clarke did n't put forward his amendment reducing the detention time from 90 days Mr Blair replies that 90 days came from the advice of the police and says that the Conservatives have to make a decision whether they are going to back the police .
Charles Kennedy , the Liberal Democrat leader , says there is cross - party consensus on the vast majority of the bill , such as the measures on acts preparatory to terrorism .
Then he asks why the PM thinks a consensus can be reached on 90 days .
Mr Blair says the Liberals have to decide today whether to back the police or not and that it is a question of leadership .
Mr Kennedy responds that it is the responsibility of parliament to take into account the advice of law lords , some of whom described 90-day detention without charge as "" intolerable "" .
He tells the PM he wo n't get consensus in the House of Lords .
Mr Blair says he prefers the advice of the police to one law lord .
Their case for why they need the extra powers is , he says , "" compelling "" .
Mr Blair then surprises the house by saying : "" Sometimes it is better to lose and do the right thing than win and do the wrong thing . ""

A Tory backbencher wants to know why his constituents ca n't see their GP on a Saturday morning .
Tony Blair replies that many GPs themselves are choosing to opt out of "" out of hours "" services .
Mark Durkan for the SDLP asks about "" collusion "" between the state and terrorists in Northern Ireland .
Mr Blair says the proposals concerning "" on the runs "" are about ending terrorism .
Andrew Rosindell , a Conservative backbencher , asks why British troops are being threatened with prosecution for their actions in Iraq while IRA terrorists are being let off the hook .
Mr Blair dismisses the suggestion that army servicemen are being threatened with legal action .
A Conservative MP , Tim Boswell , asks about the reform of incapacity benefit .
Mr Blair says the reform is about getting people back into work Labour backbencher Linda Gilroy says her mailbag did n't contain any letters opposed to the government 's 90-day proposal .
Mr Blair says he agrees .
And that 's it for this week ."
2005-11-10,"· Chinese president Hu Jintao was feted by 600 of the City 's movers and shakers at a reception at Guildhall last night .
The outgoing Lord Mayor Michael Savory hosted the evening and his successor , David Brewer ( who takes over tomorrow ) was also present .
The Chinese should steel themselves for a City onslaught over the next year :
China buff Mr Brewer is planning a couple of trips to the far east , and the Corporation of London will open offices in Shanghai and Beijing .
· There were so many u - turns yesterday they would have driven Margaret Thatcher - the lady who was n't for turning - round the bend .
Gordon Brown led the way when he arrived at Tel Aviv airport for his Middle East trip only to be ordered by the Westminster whips to go straight back to London for the terror bill vote .
Then the hacks and officials along for the Chancellor 's tour had to do a u - turn on the motorway from Tel Aviv airport - having gone on ahead .
It did n't end there .
After casting his vote , Mr Brown promised another u - turn - back to Israel .
He must be short of airmiles .
· Poker nights are becoming de rigueur in the City .
The fledgling Novus Capital Markets firm founded by trader Mike Murphy hosts a tournament at its offices tonight .
The prize goes to charity , but the winner gets a weekend at a health farm to detox after the lashings of alcohol and cigars likely to be consumed .
· Some of the gloss has been wiped off the Macquarie Millionaires Factory after it slipped up on security while on a job for the Aussie Department of Defence .
The investment bank has pulled out of advising on the $ 300 m ( £ 126 m ) new Defence HQ after it was discovered it had been sending confidential documents to employees who had n't received Defence clearance .
Not the best way to wow the Government when you 're after the plum gig of managing the A$ 30bn - plus float of Telstra , the local equivalent of BT ."
2005-11-11,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Saturday November 12 2005
The president of China Hu Jintao did not fly back to Beijing on November 10 after his visit to Britain ( China 's latest boom industry etc , page 3 , yesterday ) .
He flew to Germany for a three - day state visit .
He was meeting Angela Merkel and Gerhard Schröder before leaving to return to China late today .
The president enjoyed all the pomp and protocol that traditionally come with a state visit , reflecting the importance of the man , and the emerging superpower that he represents .
But as China 's Hu Jintao tucked into his filet de sole pompadour during the banquet at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday , and again as he flew back to Beijing yesterday after his three - day visit , Britain 's security services were left pondering a more delicate issue : how many of the president 's entourage had been left behind ?
While on the diplomatic and commercial level relations between the two countries appear to be flourishing , with British ministers and businesses eager to cash in on China 's booming economy , the security services are concerned about what is happening under the surface .
MI5 has become increasingly anxious about an increase in spying by the Chinese .
Officials are unsure how widespread it is , and what impact it is having .
The agency believes that "" at least 20 foreign intelligence services are operating to some degree against UK interests "" , and say the Chinese and Russians concern them most .
The Chinese , security sources said yesterday , have become supreme opportunists , hoovering up information on the "" grains of sand "" principle : picking up the smallest pieces of information whether relating to business , industry or security and closely analysing them back home .
Justin King , managing director of C2i , a UK counter - espionage consultancy , said yesterday that businesses were all too aware of what is happening , particularly when they hire Chinese staff . ""
The Chinese are desperate to find out everything about how western companies operate and how they are structured .
It is old - fashioned human intelligence gathering -
it 's thousands of years old and it works .
Employers should plan for the fact that there is a strong likelihood information , even if it is low - level stuff , will be fed back to China . ""
Whitehall officials cited examples : · After the deaths last year of 21 Chinese cocklers at Morecambe Bay , the Chinese government sent over what was described as a "" police delegation "" to help identify the dead men and offer any other assistance to their British counterparts .
However , the delegation was suspiciously big , leaving MI5 worried that it contained spies .
"" MI5 took certain measures to counter them , "" said a well - placed Whitehall source .
· After 58 Chinese stowaways were found dead in the back of a lorry in Dover , the Chinese government again sent a large delegation to help Kent police identify the men before the trial last year .
A member of the team was later found logging on to the police national computer .
It is unclear what he found out . ·
One British company anxious to develop its business with China recently invited a delegation to visit its factory in the UK .
The Chinese authorities sent a delegation , but only a few of them turned up .
The rest were believed to have travelled around Britain inviting themselves to defence and research establishments .
Security sources say if a British company creates a fuss about visitors who fail to turn up , the Chinese threaten to cancel the company 's licence to trade .
The Chinese are interested in particular in scientific and hi - tech developments .
"" The Chinese economy is booming but what they are short of is information technology and modern processing , manufacturing and design skills , "" said Mr King .
When Chinese nationals work in the west , he added , "" our clients ' experience is that they have mixed loyalties "" .
Mr King said : "" We have come across cases where Chinese nationals are working at the heart of British companies ' IT security departments with access to entire databases .
To my mind , that is a business risk too far . ""
In Britain , China is said to be focusing on niche products , including security and surveillance systems , and especially dual use equipment - items that have a civil as well as military use .
But the FBI is also growing anxious about the impact of Chinese spies within the US .
In February the bureau 's assistant director of counter - intelligence , David Szady , urged US businesses to help the service stop the theft of business and technology secrets .
He cited Russia , Iran , Cuba and North Korea but focused mainly on China , saying there were about 3,000 front Chinese companies in the US .
Security sources say the speed and effectiveness with which the US conducted the 1991 Gulf war was a "" wake - up call "" for the Chinese .
Mr Szardy said US companies should "" partner up "" with FBI agents to protect security .
But some would always get through , he said .
"" Even as we increase our numbers of agents , we ca n't possibly totally stop it .
If you have a little national asset , whatever it is ...
they want that little thing that you produce .
And they need it to make their missile fly straight
or so they can compete in electronic warfare . """
2005-11-13,"It gave me great satisfaction on Wednesday when Chinese President Hu Jintao told me that Lloyd 's had been given approval to set up an onshore operation in China .
This is a win - win deal .
It offers the Lloyd 's market a strong foothold in the world 's fastest - growing economy , while providing Chinese insurers with unparalleled access to the significant specialist underwriting expertise at Lloyd 's , renowned as a leader in its field .
Lloyd 's underwriters have provided offshore reinsurance to China for some time .
The importance of last week 's deal is that it enables Lloyd 's to reinsure local currency business , which comprises nearly 90 per cent of the total Chinese market .
The rate of that market 's growth will be exponential .
China 's economic output is forecast to be the largest in the world by the end of the 2030s .
In 2004 alone , its economy grew by 9.1 per cent , twice as fast as the US .
Tony Blair fully appreciated the significance of the benefits that could accrue more broadly to the UK from this licence .
Two of the numerous trips which I made to Beijing in these negotiations coincided with prime ministerial visits .
On both occasions , the Prime Minister made a significant and personal input to our discussions with the Chinese authorities .
This culminated in his meeting Hu on Wednesday , following which the agreement was finally announced .
It was crucial for Lloyd 's to establish a presence now , on the ground floor , as China begins its rapid economic ascent .
Insurance has always played a pivotal role in supporting the development of an emerging economic superpower .
Quite simply , insurance enables risk to be shared .
It supports business ventures and the development of social and physical infrastructure .
With greater global exposure , company directors face new responsibilities for which they need the proper insurance .
The onshore presence will mean that the Lloyd 's market can work more closely with local insurers , offering them the benefit of underwriting expertise and Lloyd 's capital .
It means that Chinese insurers can come to us without having to go through the more expensive and troublesome business of trading in a foreign currency .
Any close relationship takes time to develop and mature , but it is certain to benefit both sides .
As an emerging market , there is inevitably an element of the unknown in this new venture .
However , Lloyd 's can draw on decades of trading with China , providing reinsurance on an offshore basis in areas such as marine and aviation .
Much of China 's economic development is taking place in areas of catastrophe risk and exposure , such as earthquake , flood and storm - prone areas and coastal regions .
Lloyd 's will ensure that this risk is managed .
The market has a clear focus on underwriting for profit , being selective about the business it writes and spreading the risk throughout the market to ensure that it is never over - exposed .
Overall , all lines of specialist business will be crucial to China 's development , and we foresee demand increasing significantly for specialist liability , property risks and business interruption .
We will be operating in China through a wholly - owned subsidiary called Lloyd 's China Reinsurance Company Limited .
Over the coming year we will put in place the operating details of that company .
No one would pretend that the financial benefits to Lloyd 's will materialise overnight .
The Chinese insurance market is still in its infancy , but it will develop into one of the most important in the world .
This is an investment for the future .
Lloyd 's has successfully made this kind of early investment before .
The market 's US business began modestly more than 100 years ago with the first American reinsurance policy in the 1880s .
Lloyd 's underwriters then made their mark following the San Francisco earthquake in 1906 .
Today the US is Lloyd 's largest market , totalling $ 9 billion , which accounts for a third of our business .
Lloyd 's has considerable global influence and reach , not just in theUS .
However , we can never be complacent .
It is simply inconceivable that Lloyd 's could maintain and grow its global reputation without playing an active role at the heart of China 's development ."
2005-11-16,"China 's communist leadership will take a political gamble this week by holding a memorial for its most famous liberal - leaning leader Hu Yaobang , whose death sparked the Tiananmen Square protest .
Overriding concerns by several politburo members , the decision to rehabilitate the former party chief is thought to have been made by president Hu Jintao ( no relation ) as a means of shoring up his support base domestically and reviving his reformist credentials overseas .
Hu Yaobang has been one of the unmentionables in Chinese politics since his death in 1989 because he remains such a divisive figure .
During the early stages of China 's opening up in the early 1980s , he was widely admired for rehabilitating thousands of victims of the 1966 - 1976 cultural revolution and advocating greater political openness .
But his liberal views earned him many enemies .
After his removal from office in 1987 , he was accused of "" bourgeois tendencies "" and "" spreading western values "" .
His death two years later brought tens of thousands of students on to Tiananmen Square .
As the mourning turned into a protest against corrupt and repressive one - party rule , tanks and troops turned their guns on demonstrators in one of the darkest episodes of the Communist party .
Breaking with the silent treatment of previous administrations , the government announced yesterday that it would mark the 90th anniversary of Hu 's birth on November 20 .
The foreign ministry spokesman , Liu Jianchao , said the event would be attended by the central leadership and senior members of the party political and military apparatus .
No details were given , but reports in Hong Kong and other media suggest that a ceremony will be held in Beijing on November 18 , two days earlier and smaller than originally planned .
President Hu will not attend , but prime minister Wen Jiabao and other politburo members would be present and at least one of them will give a speech restoring the good name of a figure who has been in political limbo .
The motives for the move are unclear .
Optimists believe the rehabilitation of the reform - minded politician could signal a change of direction by a leadership that has been heavily criticised overseas for a repressive clampdown on the media , lawyers and civil rights organisations .
Critics see it as a ploy by an unpopular president to align himself with a much - loved political leader .
Like his namesake , Hu Jintao has built his power base among the Communist Youth League , which - with 72 m members - is bigger even than the party .
Commemorative services will also be held in Jiangxi province , the historical base of the league , and Hunan province , where Hu was born .
Li Rui , a former secretary to Mao Zedong , said the president sees Hu Yaobang as a mentor .
At a private commemorative service last year , the president was seen crying at Hu 's grave ."
2005-11-18,"Your allegation ( China 's latest boom industry : spying on British businesses , November 11 ) that many of President Hu Jintao 's entourage was left in the UK as espionage agents is groundless .
It is astonishing that so important a visit to the UK by the Chinese president has been taken advantage of .
The plain fact is that no single member of the Chinese delegation was "" left behind "" at the conclusion of President Hu 's state visit .
The Sino - British relationship is now enjoying a good momentum of development .
From political to economic cooperation , cultural to educational exchanges , academic to people - to - people contacts , bilateral ties are strengthened in virtually all fronts .
This is the win - win scenario both countries aspire to and from which both peoples benefit .
We should not return to such sensational speculations .

2005-11-18,"The Prince of Wales has launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday after it published an extract from his private journals in which he called Chinese leaders "" appalling old waxworks "" .
Prince Charles claims the paper breached his copyright and confidentiality when it used last week 's state visit by the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , as a pretext to publish a diary entry containing his thoughts on the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese in 1997 .
Entitled "" The Handover of Hong Kong or the Great Chinese Takeaway "" , it derided the "" awful Soviet - style display "" of goose - stepping Chinese soldiers during the handover ceremony .
A statement from Clarence House said the prince had made the decision to take legal action "" reluctantly "" .
"" The Prince of Wales 's office has been advised by lawyers that the Mail on Sunday has breached both the Prince of Wales 's copyright and confidentiality , "" the statement said .
Sir Michael Peat , the prince 's private secretary , said the decision was "" a matter of principle "" . ""
Like anybody else , the Prince of Wales is entitled to write a private journal without extracts being published .
This journal was copied and passed to the Mail on Sunday without permission .
"" We have made this clear to the Mail on Sunday on five occasions , both orally and in writing .
Nevertheless , the Mail on Sunday proceeded to publish these extracts despite the knowledge that it was a breach of the Prince of Wales 's copyright and confidence . ""
The Mail on Sunday said it was "" surprised "" by the prince 's decision and disputed that the journal was a private document . ""
The Mail on Sunday has not at any point accepted that last Sunday 's story about the Prince 's account of the handover of Hong Kong involved any breach of copyright or confidentiality , "" a spokesman for the paper said .
"" This was not a private journal .
It was widely distributed and viewed , as Clarence House confirmed to us , as a historic document intended for eventual publication . ""
The story raised important questions about Britain 's relations with China and the prince 's influence on British political thinking .
We believe the public has a right to know the considered views of the heir to the throne on the matters of great public interest . ""
The reporting of leaked documents is a classic journalistic enterprise .
We are very surprised at the action taken by Clarence House which , if pursued , raises serious issues about the freedom of the press . ""

2005-11-21,"In a visit to Beijing that veered between the solemn and the slapstick , President George Bush worshipped at a state - run "" patriotic "" church yesterday in an appeal for China to grant greater religious and political freedom to its citizens .
But reflecting the White House 's policy of cautious engagement , Mr Bush 's lectures about human rights were mixed with entreaties to his Chinese counterpart , Hu Jintao , for greater economic cooperation .
Apparently tired after trips to Japan and South Korea , Mr Bush was on mixed form .
At one point , he attempted to dodge a reporter 's question about his seeming exhaustion by trying to walk out through double doors that turned out to be locked .
"" I was trying to escape .
Obviously , it did n't work , "" he quipped .
An aide pointed him towards the correct door .
But the visit earned promises by China to curb the huge trade imbalance and an announcement that it will buy 70 Boeing jets worth $ 4bn ( £ 2.3bn ) .
Mr Bush 's most politically charged act was a visit to Gangwashi "" patriotic "" church , one of only five Protestant churches permitted in Beijing .
He said prayers and wrote in the guest book : "" May God bless the Christians of China "" .
The visit highlighted concerns about freedom of worship .
Just over half of China 's estimated 80 million Christians attend officially sanctioned churches while the rest worship at underground "" house "" churches that refuse to accept state control of sermons and appointments .
"" My hope is that the government of China will not fear Christians who gather to worship openly , "" the president said outside the church .
"" A healthy society is a society that welcomes all faiths . ""
Before Mr Bush 's visit , a preacher , Cai Zhuohua was jailed for three years for printing unauthorised Bibles .
According to the Associated Press , 30 protesters were detained at the church yesterday .
Other human rights campaigners were under house arrest for the duration of the visit .
The communist leadership insists that such measures are necessary to ensure social stability .
Emphasising that China 's rise is peaceful , Mr Hu outscored Mr Bush in the use of the word "" democracy "" in a joint press address . ""
Notable and historic progress has been made in China 's development of a democratic political system and human rights , "" he said .
"" The Chinese people are exercising their right of democratic elections , democratic decision - making , democratic management , and democratic supervision , according to law . ""
None the less , the hosts denied journalists the chance to ask questions and restricted domestic media coverage of the visit to an Olympic - related photo - opportunity of Mr Bush on a mountain bike .
The leaders attempted to ease tensions surrounding the US trade deficit with China , which is set to hit $ 200bn .
While making no specific promises , Mr Hu said China would cooperate to reduce the surplus , as well as gradually loosening its control over the renminbi currency .
While Mr Bush was glad - handing Mr Hu , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , referred to backtracking on human rights and raised questions about the motives for China 's military build - up .
"" We 've certainly not seen the progress that we would expect and we 'll have to keep working on it , "" she told reporters .
"" It 's not a system that 's going to change overnight . """
2006-01-04,"A Chinese journalist jailed for revealing state secrets has been freed , ahead of a trip to the US by the Chinese president , Hu Jintao .
Jiang Weiping was released Tuesday after the final year of his six - year sentence on subversion charges was commuted .
The US had previously called for Jiang 's release , and Beijing frequently releases prominent prisoners in connection with high - level contacts with foreign governments .
Jiang was sentenced in June 2001 after writing articles for a Hong Kong magazine in 1999 accusing the governor of the north - eastern province of Liaoning of covering up corruption .
The governor , Bo Xilai , is now China 's commerce minister .
A court later cut Jiang 's sentence from eight to six years , and it was to have run until January 2007 .
Jiang was convicted under China 's vague state secrets law , which has been used recently against other journalists .
A Chinese court is preparing to try Zhao Yan , a researcher for the New York Times , on charges of leaking state secrets .
His lawyer said last month that a trial could happen within six weeks .
Last year , a reporter for a Chinese business newspaper , Shi Tao , was sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges that he disclosed the contents of a secret official memo about media restrictions .
Press freedom group Reporters without Borders said this week that China had the highest number of journalists in jail at the end of 2005 .
Of the 126 journalists held in detention around the world , 32 are in China .
And last week , the editor of the Beijing News , a newspaper known for reporting on corruption and other sensitive subjects , was removed from his post .
The step prompted reporters at the paper to stage a rare , informal strike , temporarily refusing to file articles . ·

2006-01-21,"On Monday , Bolivia enters a new era .
Evo Morales will have been sworn in as the first indigenous leader of Latin America 's poorest country and , almost as importantly , Bolivians will be able to buy a replica of the striped sweater that became his trademark as he met kings , presidents and prime ministers around the world .
Eschewing the oppressive hierarchy of the dark suit , Mr Morales has been seen in the sweater at meetings with Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez , with Cuba 's Fidel Castro , Chinese premiere Hu Jintao and Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero .
"" This is a symbol of the president and what he wants to do , "" Raúl Valda , president of knitwear company Punto Blanco told Reuters , as he unveiled a copy of the striped red , blue and white sweater that has graced embassies , palaces and airport lounges in the month since Mr Morales won the Bolivian election with 54 % of the vote . ""
This is going to become a line we call ' Evo Fashion ' that we hope will appeal to young people , "" Mr Valda said .
But when Mr Morales wore the sweater for his meeting with the Spanish king , Juan Carlos II , the muttering soon began .
"" Is there no one who might lend Mr Morales a dark suit ? "" asked a writer from Spain 's conservative ABC newspaper .
Others sprang to the defence of the new leader .
The sweater , declared Manuel Rivas in El País , is a "" knitted declaration against invisibility "" .
Mr Rivas said that while generations of Latin American leaders have worn the policies and the clothes of the IMF and the World Bank , Mr Morales was showing that he was a man of the people .
But this is no Michael Foot donkey jacket .
Nor is it a desperate reach - out - to - the - people gesture along the lines of William Hague 's sweaters - and - slacks brainstorming weekend during his tenure as Tory leader .
In fact , it 's not even a sweater .
It is a chompa , a hand - knitted pullover made from alpaca wool that is considered the height of refinement in the Andes .
And as an indication of the redistribution of wealth that could take place under Mr Morales , the replica carries a humble $ 7.80 ( £ 4.40 ) price tag ."
2006-02-22,"The trial of a Chinese researcher charged with revealing state secrets while working for the New York Times is expected to take place before the end of March , following a one - month delay .
Zhao Yan , 43 , faces at least 10 years in jail after Chinese security officials charged him with telling the newspaper about the rivalry between China 's outgoing Communist party leader , Jiang Zemin , and his successor , Hu Jintao .
Mr Zhao also faces a lesser charge of fraud .
"" The court should hear the case and hand down an initial verdict before March 20 , though the date has not been set for sure , "" Mr Zhao 's lawyer , Mo Shaoping , told reporters in Beijing .
The trial has been postponed for a month after the court decided it needed more time to subpoena witnesses and re - examine evidence at the request of the defence .
Mr Zhao worked as a reporter in China , often exposing official corruption and abuse of farmers , before he joined the New York Times .
He won the Reporters Without Borders 2005 prize in December for journalists who have "" shown a strong commitment to press freedom "" .
He was arrested in September 2004 during one of the most prominent of a series of jailings of Chinese reporters in the country 's recent history .
Last April , China arrested Ching Cheong , a Hong Kong - based reporter for Singapore 's Straits Times , on spying charges .
The same month , a Chinese reporter , Shi Tao , was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being accused of revealing state secrets after he sent propaganda department directives to an overseas website .

2006-02-22,"Against a background of rising rural unrest , China yesterday unveiled ambitious plans to help the 800 million people living in the countryside catch up economically with people in the cities .
More rural investment and agricultural subsidies and improved social services are the main planks of a policy to create a "" new socialist countryside "" , which the president , Hu Jintao , says is a priority .
According to the World Bank , the policy is a significant shift away from the previous focus on economic development .
Greater weight will be given to the redistribution of resources and a rebalancing of income .
The policy was drawn up at the end of December as part of the government 's five - year economic plan , but the details were made public only yesterday .
"" Constructing a new socialist countryside is an important historic task in the process of China 's modernisation , "" says the policy .
"" The only way to ensure sustainable development of the national economy and continuous expansion of domestic demand is to develop the rural economy and help farmers to become more affluent . ""
It aims to modernise the countryside , which has fallen behind in China 's race to expand .
From this year until 2010 , the government promises sustained increases in farmers ' incomes , more industrial support for agriculture and faster development of public services .
Several measures are already under way .
This year , the agricultural tax will be phased out after hundreds of years , and farm subsidies have been raised .
But millions of peasants still can not afford basic services , such as education and health .
To improve access , the new policy promises that , by 2007 , rural students will no longer have to pay for books and heating in schools .
Students from the poorest families will receive free textbooks and boarding subsidies .
And the government will also increase subsidies for rural health cooperatives .
But local governments have been warned that they will be held to account .
The new measures promise greater protection and improved democracy in rural areas , and local government bureaucracies will be trimmed to cut costs .
In part , the policy is driven by concerns about China 's ability to feed itself .
The past 25 years of rapid urbanisation have seen swaths of farmland turned into development zones , and more than 200 million farmers have migrated to the cities .
The policy proposes that China should remain "" basically self - sufficient "" in grain .
It promises increased subsidies for farmers growing grain , as well as continued revenue "" bonuses "" for local governments in the grainbelt , and says the government will continue setting prices for grain purchases .
The shift of focus also reflects the government 's alarm at the number of peasant protests .
Last month , the ministry of public security said there were 87,000 protests , riots and other "" mass incidents "" last year , up 6.6 % on 2004 .
But the ability of central government to implement the policy is unclear .

2006-03-18,"A Beijing court dismissed state secrets charges against a Chinese researcher for the New York Times yesterday ahead of a visit by the president , Hu Jintao , to Washington .
Zhao Yan , who worked in the Times 's Beijing bureau , was detained in 2004 .
Activists had called on George Bush to lobby China for his release .
Authorities had not disclosed details of the charges against Mr Zhao , but they were said to relate to a Times report on the former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin .
The newspaper said Mr Zhao had not been involved in the story .
About 32 Chinese journalists are believed to be behind bars ."
2006-04-05,"If the number of prominent statespeople beating a path to his door is anything to go by , Indonesia 's president , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , can arguably claim to be the pin - up of the developing world : the person global leaders want to be seen with .
First there was the American president , George W. Bush , who asked to sit next to Mr Yudhoyono ( or SBY as he is usually referred to ) at a United Nations lunch in New York last year .
More recently there have been Jakarta visits by - in addition to Indonesia 's neighbours - the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , the American secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and last week , Tony Blair ( the first by a British leader since 1985 ) .
Arriving this Friday is Jan Peter Balkenende , the prime minister of the Netherlands , Indonesia 's former colonial power .
Other western leaders are thought to be strongly considering trips to Indonesia in the next month or two .
The reasons for this surge in popularity are cliched but nonetheless inescapable .
Mr Yudhoyono is the first directly elected president of the world 's third largest democracy and most populous Muslim nation .
Moreover , he is perceived as someone the world can do business with ; a moderate Muslim with a PhD in agricultural economics and a retired general who , in comparison with some of his former colleagues , is relatively untarred by the myriad human rights abuses of the nation 's authoritarian past .
Unlike his predecessor , Megawati Sukarnoputri , Mr Yudhoyono is completely dedicated to his job , while neither he nor his wife are involved in anything other than being the first couple .
And to relax , the current president takes the odd hour off to sing or play sport , rather than days to go shopping .
It is one of the most open secrets in Jakarta 's diplomatic circles that everyone was glad Mr Yudhoyono was in power , not Ms Megawati , when the 2004 tsunami struck .
Not only has Indonesia , by and large , handled reconstruction well , but the government has also used the tragedy to broker a peace deal to end the 29-year separatist insurgency in the worst - affected province , Aceh .
Indonesia 's war on terror is also bearing fruit , with a slew of senior leaders having been arrested or killed in gun battles with the security forces .
An attraction of Jakarta 's approach is that it is not using repressive legislation , as Singapore and Malaysia are , that allows detention without trial but relying on conventional prosecutions , albeit under new anti - terror legislation .
Indonesia 's economy is also starting to look a little brighter after eight years in the doldrums .
The currency and stock market are strengthening , exports are rising and desperately needed foreign investors are starting to pay more attention to the nation , particularly in the natural resources sector .
This does not mean everything is hunky - dory by a long stretch of the imagination .
Foreign leaders are visiting Jakarta to support Mr Yudhoyono as much as "" reward "" him or burnish their own credentials .
The president is dependent on others , particularly his deputy , Jusuf Kalla , to maintain peace in the often - rambunctious parliament ; by engaging with Mr Yudhoyono , foreign leaders hope he will stay in power .
Undermining all this bonhomie and back - slapping are two major issues .
The first is that the western visitors have virtually the same schedules : talks with Mr Yudhoyono and his ministers , a visit to a moderate Islamic boarding school and perhaps something linked to Aceh and/or business thrown in as well .
It 's as if Indonesia and Mr Yudhoyono are a one - trick pony , leaving one wondering if the country is suddenly off the visiting leaders ' radar screens once they 've visited .
The second is that the visitors are also conspicuously turning a blind eye to many issues which remain uncomfortable to discuss .
These include escalating tensions in the easternmost Papua province , rampant illegal logging and environmental destruction , the oppression of religious minorities , a half - hearted approach to bird ( more deadly for humans in the last four months in Indonesia than anywhere else in the world ) , the slow pace of military reform , the paucity of resources allocated to healthcare and education , and endemic corruption .
Mr Blair , for example , dismissed questions about Papua even though Australia has recently granted temporary political asylum to 42 Papuans who claimed their lives would be in danger if they returned home .
He did not even mention illegal logging , even though Britain has poured massive resources into helping Indonesia try to tackle the issue .
And he decided to "" normalise "" defence ties with Jakarta , without explaining what that means , despite Indonesia 's senior military commanders remaining largely above the law and the armed forces still not fully under civilian control .
Until visiting leaders address these thornier issues , their visits , while welcome in Jakarta , will continue to suffer in the credibility stakes ."
2006-04-18,"Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , will kick off his visit to the US starting today with a couple of events designed to show his hosts that China is indeed a "" responsible stakeholder "" in the international system .
First stop will be a production plant of Boeing in Seattle , following up China 's recent decision to buy 80 Boeing aircraft .
The Boeing visit is designed to show that China not only exports huge quantities of goods to the US , but also imports American materiel - although not enough for America 's liking .
The US trade deficit with China is a whopping $ 200bn ( £ 112.8bn ) and it is one of the sore points in the relationship .
After Boeing , will come an event even more telling of China 's desire to show its embrace of modernity .
Mr Hu , whose entourage includes his foreign and trade ministers , will dine at the home of Bill Gates , the founder of mighty Microsoft and the world 's richest man .
For Mr Hu , who can be politely described as charisma - challenged - do not expect him to emulate Deng Xiaoping and put on a 10-gallon cowboy hat - the main goal of this visit is to show Americans that China does not represent a threat .
That he should be put in a position to have to calm down the US is absurd .
The US remains the world 's sole superpower .
For all the talk of China 's rapid economic rise , it remains an economic and military weakling compared to the US .
The GDP - the total value of goods and services produced by a nation - of the US is $ 10.949bn , about 10 times of China 's GDP .
The US is also a formidable military power , its aircraft carriers and its nuclear stockpile dwarfing anything that China has in its arsenal .
Odd then to think that it is the US that feels in need of Chinese assurances .
Just think back to the furore over the attempted takeover of Unocal , a second - tier US oil company , by the state - owned CNOOC .
Congress was up in arms , blaring on about the sale of a strategic economic asset to an economic rival .
But for all its might , the US still harbours deep insecurities .
Those insecurities welled up once again at the prospect of US ports coming under management of Dubai Ports World , when it bought the UK shipping company P&amp;O. For Mr Hu , the hardest part of his visit will probably not be his meeting with George Bush at the White House - this will be their fifth summit - but dinner with members of Congress .
They are the ones in most need of wooing charm offensive as there are proposals to slap tariffs on Chinese goods .
China has said that it should not be made a scapegoat for America 's economic problems - its huge trade and budget deficits - and says it will eventually float its currency , the renminbi .
Such a move will strengthen the renminbi and should improve America 's trade position .
But China rightly points out that the US should also move to curb consumption as this would ease its import bill .
There is considerable irony in America 's uneasy attitude towards China .
The US , dating back to the late 19th century , wanted access to China 's markets through its "" open door "" policy .
Now that China has liberalised and is playing the capitalist game , America is none too thrilled at how well China is doing ."
2006-04-18,"China 's president , Hu Jintao , is no showman .
His four - day US visit , culminating in a White House summit tomorrow , is unlikely to see a repeat of Deng Xiaoping 's antics in 1979 , when he donned a 10-gallon cowboy hat , or Jiang Zemin 's 1997 recital of Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address .
There will be no meet - the - people walkabouts in Seattle or Washington .
Instead Mr Hu will concentrate on what he does best : promoting the security and economic interests of the world 's foremost aspiring superpower - while trying , for now at least , to keep the US happy .
To that end , Mr Hu sent his vice - premier , Wu Yi , and 200 businessmen and officials on a US tour last week , dispensing contracts worth $ 16bn ( £ 9bn ) .
Meetings are scheduled with Boeing and Bill Gates at Microsoft .
And when he meets George Bush he will try to allay growing US unease over its $ 202bn bilateral trade deficit , intellectual property piracy , and Beijing 's undervalued currency .
Strategic divergences over Iran and North Korea 's nuclear programmes , and Taiwan , may also be played down by Beijing .
While Mr Hu 's game - plan seems clear , Mr Bush could choose not to play ball .
The US president has never made up his mind how to deal with China 's rise .
He initially rebranded it a "" strategic competitor "" , not the "" strategic partner "" envisaged by the Clinton administration .
After 9/11 he changed tack , seeking Beijing 's support in the "" war on terror "" .
But Mr Bush obtained no help in Afghanistan or Iraq .
And he has watched as China has moved relentlessly into African and Latin American markets , undercutting Washington with its bids for energy and other natural resources while building bridges to administration hate figures such as Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez .
Beijing has blocked US demands for tough UN sanctions on Sudan , Burma and now Iran .
The US decision to downgrade Mr Hu to an "" official "" rather than "" state "" visit was a measure of its "" low expectations [ for the summit ] and is the latest in a series of public spats between the two countries "" , wrote Peter Kwong in The Nation .
The administration was particularly angered by China 's rejection of its human rights criticisms on the ground "" that a government responsible for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses has no business disparaging others "" .
Yet some say Mr Bush is playing a strong hand weakly . ""
The huge American investment in China in the last quarter of a century ( $ 51bn in 2005 ) has helped lift some 280 million Chinese out of poverty , "" said George Melloan in the Wall Street Journal .
"" The leverage the US has because of China 's dependence on US trade and investment is useful in moving China 's Communist party towards more liberal policies . ""
Will Hutton , of the Work Foundation , said : "" China 's growth has been constructed around an alarming expansion of systematic inequality . ""
He predicted that rising social instability and demands for political reform could derail China 's bid for superpower - dom . ""
Communist China 's decade - long development is something of a miracle , but the moment is rapidly approaching when China must break out of the straitjacket of top - down control if it is to maintain economic momentum . ""
In short , China 's medium - term challenge to US dominance can be exaggerated ; and the pragmatic Mr Hu , walking on eggshells and seeking a boost before the 2007 party congress , needs a successful summit more than Mr Bush ."
2006-04-20,""" Douglas , Douglas , you would make Neville Chamberlain look like a warmonger , "" lamented a retired Mrs Thatcher in 1993 .
Douglas Hurd , the British foreign secretary , had just declared the genocide of Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica no reason for a humanitarian intervention by the western powers .
Later , a bitter Bosnian government would talk of charging Lord Hurd as an accomplish to genocide at the Hague .
Well , he 's at it again .
The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , flies into Washington and Hurd calls a play straight out of the Henry Kissinger school of realism playbook .
The west , said Hurd , on the BBC Today programme , must accommodate itself to China as it is , not as we would like it to be .
When asked about the 8,000 to 10,000 people who are executed each year in China , their organs harvested by the state , without consent , for sale on the open market ( "" Providers can be found immediately , "" proclaims one Chinese transplant centre website ) ,
Hurd 's answer was at once urbane and chilling . ""
Its fine for Amnesty International to [ shout about ] it
, that 's their business .
But for governments to shout about it is to get a headline and achieve nothing ...
The United States needs to think long , how it is going to live alongside a steadily growing power , not on the basis that it is going to be able to tell [ China ] '
Oh , you 've got to be democratic , you 've got to join our campaign , our war against terrorism , our campaign for democracy ' .
That kind of talk will get nowhere .
[ The US must think ] coolly , like the Chinese think , about how they are going to live alongside a growing power in tolerable coexistence ' . ""
There are three problems with Hurd 's Kissingerian dream of a long and peaceful ( and profitable ) co - existence with tyranny .
First , it is a nightmare for those living under the boot of the tyrant .
Natan Sharansky , in his book The Case For Democracy .
The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror , recalls that when he was locked up in a Stalinist prison the most painful times were when his prison guards were able to gloatingly show him a headline in Pravda telling of some visiting western dignitary creeping and cringing before the Politburo .
Then the dissident felt very alone .
And we forget how common this was in the days of détente .
In 1975 Alexander Solzhentitsyn was refused an audience with the American president at the White House .
Fearing to antagonize the Russians , Kissinger persuaded Gerald Ford to snub Solzhentitsyn .
The AFL - CIO hosted him instead .
One can imagine how Kissinger counseled Ford .
"" It 's fine for the AFL - CIO .
That 's their business .
But for governments to shout about Solzhentitsyn ... ""
Second , far from pursuing "" peaceful co - existence "" , China is busily exporting its brand of totalitarian capitalism to any failed , grisly , or crisis - ridden state it can find .
China is like the burglar who wanders down a hotel corridor trying each door until he finds one unlocked .
Throughout Africa the influence of China is malign as energy sources are locked up and African dictatorships coddled .
The genocide continues in Darfur but China blocks sanctions - its $ 3bn investment in Sudan 's oil and gas industry comes first .
Zhou Wenzhong , deputy foreign minister of China ( speaking when he was ambassador to the United States ) said : "" Business is business .
We try to separate politics from business .
Secondly , I think the internal situation in the Sudan is an internal affair , and we are not in a position to impose upon them . ""
Chinese weapons and military hardware enable African dictators to maintain their fear societies .
When the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe , China leapt in and sold Zimbabwe $ 200 m of fighter aircraft , equipment of jam anti - government broadcasts , and electronic surveillance equipment .
Mugabe has brought a nation to its knees but for China he is "" a man of great achievements , devoted to world peace and a good friend of the Chinese people "" .
China has $ 3bn invested in oil in Nigeria and is providing the regime with military aid to defeat the rebels .
In short , the dream of "" peaceful co - existence "" ignores the fact that China is actively promoting a model of development that clashes head - on with the west 's promotion of democracy and freedom .
Third , the dream of peaceful co - existence is not even going to make us more secure .
To advance good governance and democracy abroad is the most important thing we can do to enhance our security in the west .
You want to know a country 's intentions for the rest of the world ?
Observe its treatment of its own citizens .
Fear societies export tyranny .
Why ?
Because the very mechanics of fear societies - the tensions that accumulate among the people , the techniques used for survival used by the regime , which usually revolve around the demonisation of either a persecuted internal minority or an external enemy - lead inevitably to internal repression and external aggression .
We need to elaborate a foreign policy anchored in the spread of freedom without either the reckless promotion of preventive war or cosying up to dictators .
Linkage must be established between a regime 's domestic conduct and our foreign policy towards it .
But the old left - right political model is a very poor guide to this new politics .
Some on the "" left "" are now so consumed by Americophobia ( and bedazzled by the promise of fat Chinese contracts ) that they are also eager to appease the Chinese dictators .
The mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , flew to China and spoke of the 1989 massacre of students and democrats at Tiananmen Square as no different to the protests we have known down the years in Trafalgar Square .
The comparison was , of course , grotesque .
At Tiananmen Square tanks were used against demonstrators .
Over 2000 were killed , according to the Chinese Red Cross ( student leaders claim 7,000 died ) .
"" There is no such thing as one country with a perfect record , "" said Livingstone .
Can you imagine how the Chinese prison guard taunted his hapless victim with the next days newspapers ?
So what does it really mean anymore , this business of calling Ken Livingstone "" left wing "" ?
The new divide in politics is between those who confront evil and those who appease it .
Within those two blocks arguments will rage about what , why , when , how and who .
But it is along that fault line that much of politics will run in the future ."
2006-04-20,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , met his US counterpart George Bush today , in a first official visit to Washington that comes amid tensions over trade , human rights and the status of Taiwan .
A Falun Gong protester broke through security cordons to heckle Mr Hu during his opening speech , saying that his "" days are numbered "" .
Other supporters of the spiritual movement gathered around Washington , banging gongs and waving banners accusing Mr Hu of genocide and running labour camps .
Mr Bush admitted the difficulties in the US - China relationship during his welcoming speech on the White House lawn . ""
As the relationship between our two nations grows and matures , we can be candid about our disagreements , "" he said .
"" We will address our differences in a spirit of mutual respect . ""
Mr Bush called on China to expand access to its markets for American companies , in words that will provide comfort for factions in Washington pressing for protectionist measures to restrain China 's booming economy . ""
The US and China are two nations divided by a vast ocean yet connected through a global economy which has created great opportunities for both our peoples , "" he said .
"" Our two nations share an interest in expanding free and fair trade . ""
Mr Hu dedicated a large portion of his speech to an unusually strong reiteration of Beijing 's "" One China "" policy , which holds that Taiwan is a breakaway province of China rather than an independent state .
The US and UN both officially support the policy , but the Bush administration has occasionally raised hackles in Beijing by its insistence that Taiwan 's status can not be resolved by military means .
The pair will hold talks later today , but analysts do not expect much formal progress from the meeting , given the welter of divisive issues between the two governments .
Elizabeth Economy , director for Asia studies at Washington 's Council on Foreign Relations , said that Mr Hu 's wanted to demonstrate China 's increasing status by showing that he could be treated as an equal by Mr Bush .
"" It 's important as a reaffirmation of the relationship .
Both President Bush and President Hu are committed to stability in the relationship and to moving forward , "" she said .
The tensions over the meeting even extended to arcane issues of protocol , with US and Chinese officials differing over whether to regard the trip as an official visit - as Washington describes it - or a state visit , a more distinguished title preferred by Beijing .
A law put before the US senate last month would impose tariffs of up to 27.5 % on Chinese imports to force Beijing to revalue its currency , a move which some critics see as crucial to closing the yawning trade gap between the US and China .
The US currently imports $ 202bn ( £ 113bn ) more goods and services from China than it exports to the country , the largest deficit the US has ever recorded with another country .
US critics claim the imbalance has led to a loss of more than three million US manufacturing jobs since 2001 , and say the Chinese government is exacerbating the problem by keeping its currency undervalued against the dollar .
China 's central bank introduced a limited "" managed float "" of the Yuan last July , since when it has gained more than 3 % against the dollar .
But US critics say it is still valued around 40 % too low , and want the Yuan to be freely floated on international currency markets .
The wider concern is China 's emergence as a world economic power .
By some measures China is now the world 's second - biggest economy , $ 8,200bn compared to $ 12,400bn for the US , and some estimates even expect it to overtake the US some time between 2015 and 2050 .
Official figures released today show China 's economy growing by 10.2 % , prompting a spokesman for the country 's official statistics bureau to voice fears about the economy overheating from the rate of export - driven growth .
Mr Hu 's visit to the US capital came after a two - day trip to Washington state in the Pacific north - west , where he visited iconic US businesses including Boeing , Microsoft and Starbucks .
China 's interests are well illustrated by the fact that Mr Hu spent as long visiting American businesses as he will spend visiting the US government , and by the fact that he will continue his world tour with visits to Saudi Arabia and Nigeria to discuss energy cooperation .
China 's sensitivity over Taiwan is likely to have been heightened by a carefully - timed series of moves by Taiwan 's president Chen Shui - Bian today .
He met five Chinese pro - democracy campaigners and authored a comment article in the Wall Street Journal Asia stating that China 's increasing strength necessitated compensating moves by Taiwan .
The guarded remarks could be interpreted as accepting an increase in political tensions between the countries .
Other issues likely to be on the table at the meetings include restraining apparent attempts by North Korea and Iran to acquire nuclear weapons , tackling China 's human rights record on freedom of speech and freedom of religion , and clamping down on copyright piracy by Chinese companies ."
2006-04-20,"On a day overshadowed by protests at Beijing 's human rights record , President George Bush and China 's leader , Hu Jintao , made little headway yesterday in resolving issues of trade , or easing global tensions over North Korea and Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Yesterday was meant to provide the Chinese leader with a day of pomp and ceremony : a 21-gun salute and an honour guard at the White House , obscuring the fact that this was not a full state visit .
Instead Mr Hu was embarrassed by noisy protests on the streets of Washington , and a protester who managed to disrupt the high pageantry unrolling on the South Lawn of the White House .
Moments into Mr Hu 's speech , a woman in a charcoal suit perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press began screaming in English and Chinese : "" President Bush stop him .
Stop this visit .
Stop the killing and torture . ""
She also managed to unfurl a banner in the yellow and red colours of the Falun Gong spiritual movement before being bundled away by White House security .
Her outburst - directly opposite Mr Hu 's podium - was captured by CNN and other networks .
The Associated Press later identified the protester as Dr Wang Wenyi and said the pathologist had obtained a press pass on behalf of the Epoch Times , a Falun Gong newspaper .
The heckler , and the hundreds of protesters around the perimeters of the White House , underscored the difficulties behind the Bush administration 's drive to improve economic ties with China .
Mr Hu began his visit in Washington state , where he was feted at the home of the Microsoft mogul , Bill Gates , and toured a Boeing plant .
He is to visit Yale University today .
In public , Mr Bush gave only glancing mention to human rights , noting in his speech on the South Lawn that "" China can grow even more successful by allowing the Chinese people the freedom to assemble , to speak freely and to worship .
"" It was unclear whether Mr Bush gave fuller voice to such concerns during his meeting .
The White House has been under pressure from Republicans in Congress to pressure China over its forced family planning , and its suppression of dissidents .
There is also anger at the growing trade gap , and calls for punitive tariffs .
But on the main business of the visit - America 's desire to gain greater access to Chinese markets - both acknowledged there had been no breakthroughs .
"" We do n't agree on everything but we are able to discuss our disagreements in friendship and cooperation , "" Mr Bush said .
On trade issues there was little sign of movement on the major irritant in relations : the undervaluation of the Chinese currency that has helped fuel a $ 202bn ( £ 113bn ) trade imbalance .
"" There has been some appreciation in the currency .
We would hope there would be more appreciation in the currency , "" Mr Bush said .
But he added : "" He recognises that a trade deficit with the United States is substantial , and it is unsustainable . ""
On Iran , Mr Bush noted that Beijing shared US concern about Tehran 's nuclear ambitions , but indicated there was little headway in persuading China to back security council sanctions against Iran for its efforts to enrich uranium .
On North Korea , Mr Hu said : "" The six - party talks have run into some difficulties at the moment . ""
But he gave no indication Beijing would try to push Pyongyang to disarm ."
2006-04-20,"Beijing 's hopes of a smooth summit today between presidents Hu Jintao and George Bush were undermined yesterday amid new evidence that US internet firms in China cooperated in the crackdown on dissidents .
For a section of Congress where there is increasing unease about the growing trade gap and Beijing 's human rights record , the discovery of a third instance in which Yahoo ! released information that led to the jailing of a dissident provides a powerful incentive for Mr Bush to demand concessions from Beijing .
In recent months Congress has been scathing about the business practices in China of US technology and internet firms , accusing Google , Yahoo ! and Microsoft and Cisco systems of acting as the willing accomplices to China 's secret police in return for access to its markets .
The document released yesterday by Reporters Without Borders is likely to fuel those suspicions about doing business in China .
It surfaced on a day when Congress was once again conducting hearings on China 's human rights record .
Chris Smith , the Republican chairman of the human rights committee , accused Beijing of committing "" egregious crimes against its own citizens daily "" .
Reporters Without Borders said the draft email produced yesterday was used at a 2003 trial to sentence a dissident , Jiang Lijun , 39 , to four years in prison for subversive activities .
Such revelations looked likely to intensify the misgivings about doing business in China for a Congress which is already deeply mistrustful of Beijing . ""
The president will have to discuss with President Hu all of the outstanding issues and certainly the continued issues of suppression of individual human rights and press freedoms are among the core issues we have with the Chinese government , "" Tom Lantos of California , the ranking Democrat on the house human rights committee , told the Guardian .
In anticipation of those tensions over trade and human rights , Mr Hu 's visit began in Washington state - and not the American capital .
He spent yesterday touring a Boeing plant and meeting China scholars and foreign policy experts , including Henry Kissinger .
The visible display of China 's importance to two of America 's corporate titans , Microsoft and Boeing , were viewed as a buildup to today 's summit .
Last week Chinese officials committed to a $ 5bn package to buy 80 Boeing 737s in a deal timed to allay American concerns about the trade gap ."
2006-04-21,"Chinese president Hu Jintao is visiting the United States , and he 's getting just the right welcome : a 21-gun salute at the White House , an even more rare dinner at Bill Gates 's house , and protesters everywhere he goes .
That 's just what he ought to get .
As other commenters have noted , the relationship between the world 's largest country and the world 's largest economy is crucial to world peace and prosperity .
Bush and Hu have much to discuss , no doubt more than they could get through in a one - hour meeting ( with translators ) and a lunch .
But at the same time , the head of a communist dictatorship needs to be reminded that Americans and a good many Chinese strongly disapprove of China 's repressive policies .
So , a meeting with top businessmen to discuss commerce , a meeting with the president to discuss geopolitics , and a healthy dose of what it 's like to live in a free country where people can protest in front of the White House and everywhere else .
Of course , given the attitude of both administrations toward protesters , Bush and Hu may well have discussed whether the 21 guns could be aimed at the demonstrators ."
2006-04-21,"No great expectations were attached to President Hu Jintao 's visit to Washington this week , and indeed nothing of great consequence emerged from his meetings with George Bush .
It is in the nature of such setpiece events that the biggest news is the symbolism that they are taking place at all .
So it was an electrifying departure when an accredited Chinese journalist managed to shatter the carefully choreographed tableau on the White House lawn with a shrieked protest about the persecution of the Falun Gong sect and other routine human rights abuses in the People 's Republic .
The brief outburst exposed embarrassing shortcomings in secret service vetting procedures .
But it was also a usefully frank reminder - beyond Mr Bush 's ritual call for freedom of assembly , speech and worship - of important issues that must not be overlooked as the US and the world in general adjust to the reality of "" peacefully rising "" China , with its double - digit growth , ravenous hunger for oil and other resources , and mesmerising market potential .
Little progress was made on the sensitive issues of China 's $ 200bn trade surplus with the US , the undervalued yuan , or of course on ever - neuralgic Taiwan .
There was no sign that Mr Hu is likely to back Mr Bush over Iran .
Both presidents demonstrated to their domestic constituencies that they have aired contentious issues , though without resolving them .
Mr Hu did far better in meetings in Seattle with executives from Microsoft and Boeing , promising to curb software piracy and boost domestic demand .
There is clearly a danger that the economics and politics of the complex US - China relationship may get out of step .
China is now a good deal freer and more prosperous than just a few years ago .
But even during Mr Hu 's visit reports from China catalogued police breaking up a peaceful demonstration by haemophiliacs , the continued detention of a Hong Kong reporter on spying charges and complaints about the sale of organs taken from executed prisoners .
The Falun Gong protest was broadcast live across the world but not in China itself , where government censors cut out the offending shots , so Chinese viewers only saw Mr Hu basking in respectful pomp and ceremony .
In 2008 , 19 years after the Tiananmen Square massacre , China promises to be an attentive host for the Olympics .
China matters and will matter much more to America and the rest of the world as this century advances .
But human rights , fundamental freedoms and the rule of law can not be simply swept under the red carpet ."
2006-04-22,"Last week George Bush , leader of the most powerful country on earth , met Hu Jintao , his banker .
Mr Hu presides over a country which has $ 1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves , the proceeds of a vast trade imbalance with the US .
Last year China sold around $ 240bn worth of cheap goods to America .
Next year it will be more like $ 300bn .
By hoarding dollars , China keeps its own currency artificially low , which in turn fuels the export boom .
Or , put another way , Chinese manufacturers are having a great time feeding the insatiable appetite of US shoppers , who ca n't get enough of those low Chinese prices .
The Americans , meanwhile , have money in their pockets because they can borrow at low interest rates , which are in turn a product of China buying bucks on international markets .
This is an unspoken bargain and a perilous one .
The US trade deficit can not keep growing exponentially .
American industry desperately wants to sell something back to the Chinese , but their bloated currency , among other things , holds them back .
The background to last week 's summit is an ominous rise in tensions .
Mr Hu promised that China would buy more American goods , and he dished out some juicy orders to Boeing .
But this will not satisfy those who argue ever more vociferously that the US is destroying its industrial base to support a communist country 's industrialisation .
There are 20 anti - China bills currently in Congress .
To head them off , Mr Bush needed a promise that China would revalue its currency .
He got nothing .
This was a diplomatic failure on the part of Mr Bush , but that does not mean it was a success for Mr Hu - not in the long term .
Without more effective dialogue , the US and China look set to follow their current trajectory towards a trade war that would have catastrophic consequences for both countries ."
2006-04-23,"When President Hu Jintao of China arrived in the US last Wednesday , his first appointment was dinner with Bill Gates , co - founder and chairman of Microsoft , at Gates 's mansion ( aka San Simeon North ) on the shores of Lake Washington .
They dined on smoked guinea fowl , which had been shot at by the US Vice - President , Dick Cheney .
( He missed , and hit one of his friends instead ; the guinea fowl was later killed by humane means . )
The pair were joined by Steve Ballmer , CEO of Microsoft , the Chinese ambassador to the US , a number of the President 's aides and the deputy assistant head of protocol at the White House .
Owing to an unpatched security hole in Gates 's Windows - powered home - monitoring system , the meeting of the two Great Leaders was bugged and a transcript of their conversation has been obtained by The Observer ...
Gates :
You Hu ?
Hu :
I am the President of China .
Gates :
Cool .
I 'm the Chairman of Microsoft .
( Hu bows . )
Hu :
Because you , Mr Bill Gates , are a friend of China , I am a friend of Microsoft .
Gates :
Wow !
That 's really cool .
We 're very interested in China , you know .
Big market .
Smart people .
Hu :
We are pleased that many great US companies are coming to China - for example Google .
Ballmer : (
Heatedly )
Those sons of bitches .
They stole one of our top Chinese execs ...
Gates :
Cool it , Steve .
Hu does n't know about that .
Hu :
We also have Yahoo in China .
They are very co - operative in rooting out undesirable elements .
Ballmer : ( Mutters . )
Maybe they could help root out Google ...
Hu :
We like Google very much .
They are most understanding of our needs .
Chinese people do not want to know about freedom and democracy .
They just want to know where to buy BMW cars and plasma TVs and such things .
Gates :
Now that you 're here , Hu , I got ta problem
I 'd like to share with you .
Hu :
I will be honoured to help you ,
Mr Bill Gates .
What is your problem ?
Or , as your Harvard Business School says , should I call it an ' opportoonity ' ?
Gates :
Eh ?
Oh , I see .
Well it sure looks like a problem to me .
You see you have a lot of PCs in China ...
Hu : (
Proudly )
Yes , we have already 500 million PCs ...
Gates : ... and they 're mostly running Windows XP .
Hu :
( Beaming ) .
Certainly .
The latest version with Service Pack 2 installed .
We are becoming a most leading - edge economy .
Also they have Office Productivity Suite including PowerPoint .
It is a most excellent situation .
What is your problem , Mr Bill ?
Gates :
The problem is that , as far as we can see - and Steve here has looked at the figures - we only sold 153 Windows XP and 25 Office licences in the whole of China last year .
Those damn PCs are all running bootleg - pirated - software and we have n't made a dime in licence fees on any of them .
This is not good , Hu , not good at all ...
Ballmer :
Too damn right ...
And it all happens because your factories are shipping cheap PCs with blank hard drives and no pre - installed operating system .
Then those lousy schmucks install ripped - off versions of our software on them .
( At this point , a Chinese official whispers in the President 's ear .
After a few moments , Hu turns back to Gates . )
Hu : (
Gravely ) .
I see why you are distressed , Mr Bill .
And because China wishes to be friends with Microsoft , your distress also distresses me .
But my officials tell me that we have solved the problem .
Gates :
Cool .
How ?
Hu :
Chinese factories will no longer turn out these - how you say ? - naked PCs .
All will come with operating system pre - installed .
Gates :
Great stuff !
Which version ?
Windows 2000 or XP ?
And do n't forget Vista
- we 'll be shipping that soon .
Hu :
No .
Red Flag Linux .
Made in China .
( At this point , Ballmer screams , picks up a chair and hurls it at the $ 250,000 video - wall in Gates 's dining room , shattering screens and shorting the lights . )
Gates :
That 's the dumbest idea I 've ever heard , Hu .
Hu :
I do not understand , Mr Bill .
First you tell me that you do n't like these PCs with no operating system , and then you say you do n't like them with operating system .
I am confused .
Gates :
The thing is , Hu , that Linux system is bad news .
Ballmer :
You said it , buddy .
Spawn of the devil .
Hu :
What is wrong with it ?
Gates :
Well , for starters , it 's a system put together by a bunch of hippies .
Ballmer :
It 's like , totally un - American .
Hu :
Does that mean it does n't work ?
Gates :
No , it works fine .
Better than that goddam pre - release version of Vista , in fact .
Hu :
So why do you dislike it so much , Mr Bill ?
Gates :
Well , those damn hippies just give it away .
Ballmer :
It 's basically , well , communistic .
Hu :
( Shocked )
Ah , now I see .
We are totally opposed to communism too , Mr Bill .
How much will you charge for 500 million Vista licences ?

2006-04-24,"After pressing the flesh in the US , the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , moves on to Africa this week .
It is 50 years since China first established a presence in Africa , forging diplomatic relations with Egypt .
Beijing 's courtship of African countries during the cold war was symbolised by its help in ambitious projects , such as the Tanzam railway between Tanzania and Zambia .
The venture was designed to show the world that China took its fraternal socialist responsibilities seriously and to demonstrate the existence of ideological and economic alternative to the US and the then - USSR .
Now China is cultivating ties in Africa not out of socialist ideals but out of economic necessity .
The country 's booming economy craves natural resources such as oil and minerals .
Oil contracts have been signed with Nigeria and Gabon , while Chinese mining companies are setting up shop in South Africa to buy cobalt , copper , nickel and platinum in southern Africa .
The official Chinese press glosses over such economic imperatives in its reporting of Mr Hu 's African tour .
The China Daily quotes President Hu 's four principles for the relationship between Asia and Africa : "" Respect and support each other in politics , complement each other for common success in economics , learn from each other 's strong points in culture , and maintain mutual trust , dialogue and coordination in security . ""
In other words , unlike western democracies , you wo n't hear us bleating on about human rights .
We wo n't lecture you on the way you treat your citizens , we 're here to trade for our mutual benefit .
Thus Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe , a pariah in the west , was greeted last year during a trip to Beijing as an "" old friend "" .
Similarly , Sudan , another pariah state for the atrocities occurring in Darfur , is also treated as a friend because China buys Sudanese oil .
This pragmatic , cold - eyed approach to diplomacy raises some hackles in the west , particularly with human rights groups , but goes down well in countries such as Kenya , which has been come in for considerable stick for corruption .
On the face of it , China 's application of realpolitik puts it at odds with that self - proclaimed beacon of democracy and freedom , the US .
But the Bush administration makes its own compromises with unpleasant regimes .
Mr Bush this week will welcome Ilham Aliyev , the autocratic ruler of energy resource - rich Azerbaijan .
Even on Darfur , the US and Europe have done little to back up their words of criticism .
Western governments get the worst of both worlds in Africa .
They manage to rankle governments they criticise but show little appetite to go beyond rhetoric .
No wonder China is gaining in the battle for the continent 's hearts and minds ."
2006-04-24,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , was heckled at the White House , and excoriated in the Washington Post .
And he came under attack from bloggers for the imprisonment of Chinese blogger Hao Wu .
Managing China will be a bigger issue over the coming decades than managing Iran and Iraq , which is unfortunate as those appear to be enough of a challenge .
Fortunately , the Chinese appear more rational than the Iranians .
We had a podcast interview today with James Dunnigan and Austin Bay of the military / diplomatic site
StrategyPage.com .
You can click right here to listen to it directly , or you can get it via iTunes here .
( There 's a dial - up version here , and background is here . )
I agree with Dunnigan and Bay that military strikes on Iran are a bad idea at the moment , and that we should be pursuing other approaches .
They offer some hope that the Bush administration also favours a less direct approach , but we 'll have to wait and see , I suppose .
We also talked to blogger Michael Totten , who 's been reporting from Lebanon and Iraq for the past several months , funded by his readers .
It 's an interesting story of alternative journalism , and I highly recommend his reporting ."
2006-05-08,"China has always demonstrated wishful thinking , from the Great Wall , which was never quite what it was imagined to be , to the celebration of the supposedly caring , paternal nature of Mao Zedong .
This year we have had the demeaning example of the mayor of London equating the Tiananmen Square massacre to the London poll tax riots , while the former World Bank and Nobel prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has managed to conclude that a low - tax , low - welfare , privatising , high - trading economy that has brought a steeply rising wealth gap and left hundreds of millions by the wayside is somehow a panacea superior to the nostrums of his favourite bugbear , the IMF .
After President Hu Jintao 's visit to Washington last month , the new watchword is that China and the west must "" get on "" .
The underlying assumption stems from a familiar mixture of western arrogance and the comforting assumption that , whatever their differences , countries really want to work together for the greater good of the planet ; it takes no account of the Chinese experience .
For most of its history , the country and its rulers could n't have cared less about the rest of the world ; then they found themselves getting a raw deal from foreigners , who imposed themselves by force in the 19th and early 20th centuries .
After this , when Chinese governments sought to engage with the international system they found the experience far from encouraging , from the discovery in 1919 that the allies had cut a secret deal giving Japan Chinese territory to the abject failure of the League of Nations to offer anything beyond words to halt Tokyo 's aggression from 1931 .
US policy in the second world war was another big letdown , and the victorious communists of 1949 could hardly have had much time for a US that had poured in help to their nationalist opponents .
Then came the Maoist era , meaning that it was only towards the end of the century that a real engagement emerged through trade between the mainland and the world .
China has made its way on its own terms over the last two decades .
Foreign investment has been important , but it operates under terms set by Beijing .
Exports remain worryingly important as a driver of the country 's growth because of the soggy state of domestic demand and the high savings rate .
The world , however , needs those exports as much as China does , to keep down inflation and fund the US federal deficit and US consumption .
Chinese buying of plant and machinery and big - ticket infrastructure and transport items helps to fill order books for western companies , and politicians and business leaders fall over themselves to court Beijing ; American high - technology firms play along with the cyber censors in pursuit of the Chinese market .
Beijing can only take all this as deeply encouraging .
Far from making concessions to western feelings , it has no compunction about cosying up to nasty regimes , from Burma to Zimbabwe , its security council veto a potential trump card for North Korea and Sudan .
And it plays the global energy game with a vengeance , from Venezuela to Nigeria and Iran .
For the record , Beijing assures the world that all it wants to see is the "" peaceful rise of China "" .
But that peace is to be achieved , above all , by other powers not getting in its way .
Given the global impact of the mainland , as well as the areas for conflict , the formula may turn out to be an oxymoron for our times .
In the realm of the national interest , there is nothing unusual in this - think of Britain in the 19th century , Germany in the first half of the 20th and America for much of the time from 1941 .
One should not expect China to act any differently , particularly given its history since the first opium war , more than 150 years ago .
Faced with a mountain of domestic challenges , Beijing is simply looking after itself and asserting its status .
It sees no reason to adapt , and adopts a suitably high profile ; its president is at ease delivering a lecture on democracy to George Bush while supervising a new wave of repression of anything approaching dissidence .
This will be the shape of the decades to come , and the west urgently needs to decide how it wants to deal with a country that is pursuing old - fashioned great - power politics and believes it is moving into the driving seat .
This is not to advocate a cold war crouch in the west ( and Japan ) , but simply to recognise the new reality in dealing with a country whose leaders have no use for the rose - tinted spectacles the west tends to don in looking at east Asia -at Japan , in the first half of the 20th century , and then China , under Mao and later its new , managerial rulers . ""
Getting on "" is a two - way process .
To assume that this is how Beijing thinks is to fall into yet another China dream ."
2006-06-15,"China ramped up its role as a global player on Thursday by hosting a summit of states encompassing almost half the world 's population and some of Washington 's most prominent opponents .
The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , said the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation - which brought together the leaders of 10 nations in and around central Asia - is designed to promote peace and stability in a region that has become an increasingly important source of oil and gas .
But the group 's potential role as a counterweight to the US was underlined by the presence of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who received a warm welcome in Shanghai despite his country 's standoff with international nuclear inspectors over Tehran 's uranium enrichment program .
Mr Ahmadinejad said his country 's participation could "" turn the SCO into a strong , influential economic , political and trading institution at both regional and international levels and prevent the threats of domineering powers and their aggressive interference in global affairs "" .
The growing power of China has prompted a rethink in Washington , where rightwing analysts now speak of the SCO as an embryonic rival to Nato .
Their fears have been strengthened in the past two years by the inclusion in the SCO of Iran , Pakistan , India , Mongolia and Afghanistan as either observer or guest nations .
But it is in the field of energy that the SCO appears to be most powerful .
The countries gathered in Shanghai control almost a quarter of the world 's oil supplies and are building a series of pipelines across the region .
A pipeline is being planned from Iran to China that would cross Pakistan , whose president , Pervez Musharraf , yesterday requested to be admitted as a full member of the SCO .
Mr Ahmadinejad called for a meeting of SCO energy ministers to discuss closer cooperation in exploration , development and shipping . ""
The SCO groups both energy - producing nations and energy - consuming ones , "" he said .
"" Energy has been playing an increasing rule in national development and progress . ""
His comments are likely to rankle in Washington .
Last week the US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , criticised China and Russia for backing Iran 's participation in the summit , saying he found it strange to bring the "" leading terrorist nation in the world into an organisation that says it 's against terror "" .
Participants dismissed fears that the SCO was a rival to the US .
"" Our actions are not aimed at the interests of other countries and do not signal the formation of another bloc , "" the president of Uzbekistan , Islam Karimov , said .
Chinese officials describe this week 's summit as their most important diplomatic event of the year .
An unprecedented security operation has shut down a large part of the usually bustling Pudong district near the conference centre and millions of the city 's residents have been given a special three - day holiday .
Such is the attention to detail that windows on part of the leaders ' route have been screwed shut and police have instructed locals not to leave flower pots on balcony ledges in case they fall .
The SCO - one of the world 's youngest international groupings - began life 10 years ago as a forum for settling border disputes between its core members : China , Russia and four Central Asian states - Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan .
Although its activities have expanded to cover anti - terrorism exercises , energy cooperation and banking in the five years since it became a formal institution in 2001 , most western commentators have dismissed the SCO as a dictators ' club that is long on style and short on substance .
On Thursday the leaders signed a joint statement on information security , economic cooperation and cross - border military exercises .
"" It remains the top priority of the organisation to combat the threats posed by terrorism , separatism and extremism as well as drug trafficking , which have not diminished but aggravated in scale and degree , "" the statement noted .
Human Rights Watch say the member countries use this as a pretext to crack down on legitimate and peaceful protests ."
2006-07-03,"The Tibet v China game has been going on for several decades but this week enters what many feel may be the decisive phase as China 's powerful attack drives deep into Tibetan territory via the world 's highest railway , the 710-mile Golmud to Lhasa line .
The Chinese gaffer
President Hu Jintao hailed the opening of the Qinghai - Tibet railway , claiming the new route one tactic would bring a quick end to the long - running tie .
On paper it already looked like a hopeless mismatch with China 's massive and richly funded superpower squad pitted against the distinctly non- League resources of the plucky Himalayan nation .
However , this is very much a cup fixture and as students of the game know : on its day even the smallest potential banana skin can fell a putative giant .
Millions of neutral fans and self - determination - of - nation - state romantics will be keeping their fingers crossed Tibet go on to play Hereford to China 's Newcastle .
The Chinese team has drawn criticism for its poor performance against the mountain minnows but Hu yesterday dismissed comments as typical Imperialist media mischief and claimed his squad was "" ambitious , confident and capable of standing amongst the world 's advanced nations "" .
The bookies have Hu 's side as massive favourites to turn their territorial dominance into an outright win eventually but the many celebrity supporters of the underdogs draw comfort from the fact that even at this late stage their team is still holding out .
The Tibet boss , the Dalai Lama , has called on his lads to carry on not putting up a battling display but to sit back peacefully in their own half and let events take their course .
So far these unusual tactics have kept his side in with a non - fighting chance ."
2006-07-28,"The safety of passengers on the world 's highest - and newest - railway is threatened by cracks , yaks and shifting sands , the Chinese government has admitted .
Less than a month after the opening of the line across the Himalayas to Tibet , it has become unstable in places because the foundations are sinking into the permafrost , railway ministry spokesman Wang Yongping , told the Beijing News today .
Crossing the rugged Qinghai plateau and climbing to 5,072 metres ( 16,640 ft ) above sea level , the $ 4.2bn ( £ 2.3bn ) railway was hailed by president Hu Jintao as an engineering miracle for the world .
But it was always likely to be harder to maintain than to build .
The line depends on coolants to stop the ice upon which it rests from melting .
But global warming has raised temperatures in the mountain region faster than expected .
As well as damaging concrete pillars and bridges , it has added to the problem of sand dunes that encroach upon the track .
Tunnels were built under elevated sections so that the endangered Tibetan antelope could pass by without danger .
But planners have failed to cope with a far less timid and more numerous beast - the yak , thousands of which graze along the tracks and wander across them . ""
These form dangers to passengers on the train , "" Mr Wang said ."

2006-09-12,"The Chinese prime minister , Wen Jiabao , flew into London today amid rising international criticism of his government 's crackdown on lawyers , journalists , NGOs and civil liberties activists .
In the most repressive phase since Mr Wen and President Hu Jintao came to power in 2003 , at least 100 dissidents have been jailed , beaten or placed under house arrest in Beijing alone since the middle of last month , human rights groups said yesterday .
Adding to the chill , China has announced new media restrictions and launched an investigation of charity organisations and environment campaigners who receive foreign funding .
The crackdown comes after a record number of protests last year against land seizures , pollution and corruption .
The government is concerned that such demonstrations could lead to another "" colour revolution "" of the sort seen in several former Soviet republics last year .
The tightening of controls has undermined hopes that the Chinese leadership would pursue a policy of gradual political relaxation and it threatens to overshadow Mr Wen 's visit .
In talks tomorrow with Tony Blair , the Chinese premier is expected to request the EU lift the ban on arms sales to Beijing , which was imposed after the 1989 massacre of civilians in and around Tiananmen Square .
The EU has said it will not remove the embargo unless China improves its human rights situation .
Since mid - August , civil liberties campaigners say the authorities have launched a coordinated campaign to clamp down on their activities nationwide .
"" A large number of rights activists , including human rights lawyers , journalists , writers and other activists , have been detained or watched and harassed , "" the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders said in a statement yesterday .
"" Some activists have disappeared .
Several have been subjected to unfair trials or harsh sentences in local Chinese courts .
"" It cited several dozen examples , including the arrest of outspoken human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng , the beating of peasant campaigner Liu Zhengyou in Sichuan province and the repeated detentions of Aids activist Hu Jia .
The Chinese government has crammed together a series of controversial trials , arrests and repressive new policies , presumably in the hope of getting critical overseas coverage out of the way in time for the Olympics in 2008 and an important communist party congress next year .
Last month , the three court cases with the highest international profile of the past two years were settled in the space of little more than a week .
Blind activist Chen Guangcheng was sentenced to four years in prison , New York Times assistant Zhao Yan three years , and the Straits Times correspondent Ching Cheong five years .
This summer , the government also announced plans to fine media organisations that report on disasters and protests without permission .
On Sunday , the Xinhua news agency proclaimed new regulations that oblige foreign media to seek its approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within China .
The foreign firm 's business licences are threatened if they report news that endangers national security , sabotages national unification or promotes cults .
The European Union said it would complain about the regulations during its human rights talks with China in October .
"" Any kind of restrictions on the freedom of the press , increasing the intervention of the state , is a very negative development , "" said the European Commission president , Jose Manuel Barroso .
Sharon Hom , the executive director of Human Rights in China , said the new rules breached Beijing 's "" commitment to allow journalists to freely cover the Olympic Games in 2008 "" .

The trials were closed .
Media pressure
In July , China - already the world 's biggest censor - announced plans for more media control , with a new law imposing financial penalties on news organisations that report on emergencies without permission .
On Sunday , Xinhua news agency proclaimed new regulations obliging the foreign media to seek its approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within China .
Reports deemed to endanger national security , sabotage national unification or promote cults are punishable by warnings and , ultimately , the removal of business licences .
At least three foreign journalists were detained in August .
Arrest and detention
On August 15 , the outspoken lawyer Gao Zhisheng , a civil rights figurehead , was arrested .
No charge was made public and he has not been heard from since .
According to the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders , nearly 100 people have been detained or placed under house arrest since mid - August .
They include the writer Liu Xiaobo , lawyer Teng Biao , activist Hou Wenzhuo and Aids campaigner
Hu Jia .
NGO investigation Since last year
, Chinese agents have been investigating NGOs ( non - governmental organisations ) particularly those that are partly funded by foreign governments .
There is a virtual freeze on registration of groups and staff have been interrogated .

2006-09-25,"The Communist party chief of Shanghai has been fired in China 's highest - level corruption scandal in more than 10 years , the state media reported yesterday .
The sacking of Chen Liangyu signals an escalation of a purge of unruly regional leaders and political opponents by the president , Hu Jintao , as he tightens his grip on power .
Mr Chen is the most senior of at least half a dozen politicians and business people implicated in the misappropriation of about a third of Shanghai 's 10bn yuan ( £ 700 m ) social security fund .
He is accused of illegal business activity , covering up crimes and abusing his position to secure benefits for his family . ""
Comrade Chen Liangyu has created malign political effects , "" Xinhua news agency said .
"" Anyone who violates party rules or national law will be severely investigated and punished . ""
Although the party claims to have been fighting corruption for a decade , it is rare for a senior figure to be held to account ."
2006-09-25,"The Communist party chief of Shanghai has been fired in China 's highest level corruption scandal in more than 10 years , state media reported today .
The sacking and criminal investigation of Chen Liangyu signals an escalation of president Hu Jintao 's purge of recalcitrant regional leaders and political opponents as he tightens his grip on power ahead of a key party meeting next year .
In recent months , the deputy mayor of Beijing , a chief prosecutor in Tianjin , a senior naval officer and a deputy governor have been arrested on corruption charges .
But the dismissal of Chen - a politburo member and party secretary of the country 's commercial capital - is by far the boldest move yet by Mr Hu to crack down on graft and restore discipline .
Chen , who studied briefly at Birmingham University , is the most senior of at least half a dozen politicians and businessmen implicated in the misappropriation of about a third of Shanghai 's 10bn yuan ( £ 700 m ) social security fund .
He is accused of illegal business activity , covering up crimes by his colleagues and abusing his position to secure benefits for members of his family . ""
Comrade Chen Liangyu has created malign political effects , "" said the Xinhua news agency in reporting the decision taken by the politburo yesterday to remove the suspect from all positions of responsibility .
"" Whoever it is , no matter how high their position , anyone who violates party rules or national law will be severely investigated and punished . ""
His picture , job description and career record were promptly removed from the Shanghai government website .
Although the Chinese government claims to have been fighting corruption for more than a decade , it is very rare that such a senior figure is held to account .
The closest recent case occurred in 1995 when the secretary of the Beijing party , Chen Xitong ( no relation ) , was fired and sentenced to 16 years in prison .
The rivalry between China 's two most powerful cities is a factor .
Shanghai is the powerbase of Hu 's predecessor as president , Jiang Zemin .
Under his protection the local party hierarchy was able to keep hold of all of the city 's top political posts for 15 years , avoiding the rotation system that applied in every other province .
Partly as a result , critics accused the "" Shanghai gang "" of running one of the least transparent governments and most tightly controlled media environments in the country .
In 2003 there was an outcry when local real estate tycoon Zhou Zhengyi was found guilty of fraud but sentenced only to a short prison term .
The punishment of Chen also appears to be intended as a warning to senior regional officials in other provinces that they can not ignore the orders of the central government .
In recent years Mr Hu and his premier , Wen Jiabao , have had trouble asserting their authority on issues as diverse as environmental protection , land development and industrial safety because local leaders are so focused on making money .
It has also interfered with the state 's ability to cool down an economy in danger of overheating .
Mr Chen reportedly rebuffed the central leadership when he was ordered to slow the momentum of Shanghai real estate market .
In the first eight month 's of the year , the city 's economy grew 12.4 % per cent - fast even by China 's runaway standards .
The city 's social security scandal may also have been just too big too ignore .
In August about 100 central government investigators were dispatched to Shanghai to look into the allegations .
Among the other detainees was Wu Minglie , the chairman of the New Huangpu group , one of the city 's biggest conglomerates .
Soon after the investigation began , Mr Chen was quoted by local media as saying : "" We can not for a single moment relax our work on opposing corruption and advocating honesty . ""
His position will temporarily be filled by the mayor of Shanghai , Han Zheng .
In the longer term , president Hu is rumoured to want to appoint Liu Yandong - a female party official from Beijing - to the post ."
2006-09-29,"In 2003 , when Hu Jintao became president of China and , more important , head of the last major Communist party in power , there was some speculation that he might turnout to be a political reformer .
Optimists trawled through the work done at his power base , the Party School , in search of indications that he would prove the political moderniser China so badly needs to complement its economic development .
Hu has thoroughly disappointed any such hopes , showing his colours recently with a stern crackdown on dissent and muzzling of the media .
But this week has seen a significant move by the president , which , if carried through , could betoken a major change in the way China operates .
It has nothing to do with political reform , democracy or the rule of law or accountability .
It is high - level politics in its crudest form , designed to redress relations within the power structure .
By detaining the party boss in Shanghai , Chen Liangyu , the president may have fired the opening shot in a campaign to bolster central authority round himself and his colleagues .
This is not simply a question of building up the status of the new generation leadership - important part of the process thought that is .
What Beijing seems to be after is to combat the fragmentation of authority from the centre to the provinces before next year 's major party congress .
The fragmentation is a process that began 150 years ago as the later Qing emperors were forced to devolve power to provincial gentry leaders to fight the huge rebellions of the mid-19th century , It continued under the warlords and the Nationalist Republic in the first of the 20th century and , after a period of centralisation under Mao , re - asserted itself from the 1980s as provinces raced ahead to take advantage of market - led reform with scant concern for what Beijing said .
Now , Hu appears to have decided that it is time to try to turn back the tide of the last decades which have seen provinces going their own way , building steel mills and industrial plants without permission and cocking a snoot at recent calls to slow down investment .
Chen 's dismissal on corruption charges is the climax of a specific fight - between Beijing and the "" Shanghai faction "" which ran China under Hu 's predecessor , Jiang Zemin , and his prime minister , Zhu Rongji , both former mayors of the country 's biggest city .
Since Jiang was elbowed out of his last major post as chairman of the Military Commission last year , his group has been on the slide though it was still influential enough to block a planned move against Chen last year .
Now one of the ex - president 's close associates appears to have allied with the new leadership and another has been sidelined by cancer .
So Chen became vulnerable .
Though a stop - gap has been put in , Hu will almost certainly name one of his trusties to take over the city which has been made into the beacon of China 's economic growth and opening to the world .
The fight against corruption is a real necessity in today 's China , but it also serves as a convenient way of settling political scores - officials no longer get fired for ideological divergences but for more market - minded crimes .
A warning shot was fired at Shanghai with the arrest of a leading developer who had traded on his contacts with the city government , and then , this summer , an investigation team was sent in .
As a result , Chen is accused of complicity in the funnelling off of large parts of the assets of the city 's billion - dollar pension and welfare fund .
He is the first serving Politburo member to have been pursued in this way for a decade .
By going for such a high - profile target , Hu is serving a warning to other independent - minded provincial leaders - a crack down has also been reported in Henan and may be on the cards elsewhere .
As the saying goes , when the tree falls , the monkeys scatter .
Hu and his administration know that , for all its bounding economic statistics , the mainland faces huge problems - in sustaining growth , dealing with wealth disparities and the urban - rural divide , pacifying dissent that produces 70,000 protests a year involving more than 100 people , environmental catastrophes , the bad debts of the state banks , runaway money supply , over - investment , too high savings and too low consumption , and yes , corruption - but , above all , in the lack of legitimacy for a threadbare party that claims a monopoly on power based on historical myths and use of force .
In that vortex , Hu can not allow leading figures like Chen to cock a snoot at the central government in its effort to bring order to today 's China .
A quarter - of - a - century ago Deng Xiaoping launched the move to the market to try to save the Communist Party .
Today , the brake has to be applied to rein in the political and social effects of break - neck growth ,
Otherwise , the Communist party 's hold on power will be compromised by the very success of Deng 's experiment .
As a cautious , managerial leader , Hu may yet pull back in the face of the entrenched opposition in the nexus of provincial - official power .
Next year 's party congress will be the testing time .
But if he sticks to his guns , and the move against Chen proves a sign of things to come , the Chinese paradigm is in for a shaking which could make or break the leadership ."
2006-10-04,"Japan 's new prime minister will meet the leaders of South Korea and China next week to repair damaged relations and discuss the region 's response to a possible nuclear test by North Korea .
Shinzo Abe , who took office last week , sought an early meeting with the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , amid fears that his hawkish stance on defence and criticism of Beijing 's military build - up would lead to a further deterioration in bilateral ties .
"" We intend to move forward in a future - looking relationship with our neighbours China and South Korea by expending every effort to engage in dialogue and working closely with them , "" Mr Abe said .
Liu Jianchao , a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , said : "" China and Japan have reached consensus on overcoming political obstacles affecting bilateral relations and on encouraging the healthy development of friendly , cooperative relations .
"" Japan is locked in disputes with South Korea and China over territorial claims and accusations that it has yet to atone for its wartime conduct .
Its leaders held their last full summit with their Chinese counterparts in 2001 , and they have not met South Korean leaders since November ."
2006-10-04,"Japan 's new prime minister will meet the leaders of South Korea and China early next week in an attempt to repair damaged relations and to discuss the region 's response to a possible nuclear test by North Korea .
Shinzo Abe , who took office last week , had sought an early meeting with the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , amid fears that his hawkish stance on defence and criticism of Beijing 's military build - up would lead to a further deterioration in bilateral ties .
He will visit China on Sunday for talks with Mr Hu before leaving for Seoul to meet the South Korean president , Roh Moo - hyun .
"" We intend to move forward in a future - looking relationship with our important neighbours China and South Korea by expending every effort to engage in dialogue and working closely with them , "" Mr Abe said .
Liu Jianchao , a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , said : "" China and Japan have reached consensus on overcoming political obstacles affecting bilateral relations and on encouraging the healthy development of friendly , cooperative relations . ""
Tokyo hailed the meetings as an ideal start to Mr Abe 's premiership .
"" We feel this is quite significant for Prime Minister Abe to visit both China and South Korea soon after taking office , "" said Hiroshi Suzuki , the deputy cabinet secretary for public relations .
Japan is locked in disputes with South Korea and China over territorial claims and accusations that it has yet to atone for its wartime conduct on the Asian mainland .
The leaders of China and Japan held their last full summit in 2001 , and Mr Hu had refused to meet Mr Abe 's predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , since April last year in protest at his annual visits to Yasukuni , a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan 's war dead .
The South Korean and Japanese leaders have not met since November last year .
Mr Abe , Japan 's most nationalist leader for years , made a secret visit to Yasukuni in April , but appears to have placated Mr Hu and Mr Roh by refusing to state whether or not he would worship there as prime minister .
The need for better regional cooperation was highlighted by North Korea 's announcement yesterday that it planned to test a nuclear weapon , a move Mr Abe condemned today . ""
Naturally , we simply could not accept if North Korea were to conduct a nuclear test , "" he said ."
2006-10-04,"Could Japan 's new prime minister , Shinzo Abe , be his country 's De Gaulle or Nixon ?
The announcement that he will have talks with President Hu Jintao of China this weekend could turn out to be the sign of a major shift in the politics of the world 's most important growing economic region .
It has been conventional wisdom to see the insistence of Japanese prime ministers on visiting the shrine containing grade one war criminals as a sign of resurgent Japanese nationalism that will disrupt East Asia .
That begs the huge question of China 's own nationalism , which has its own virulence , which is a political construct only a century or so old , and which has been orchestrated by Beijing to fit its wider geo - political needs - China , after all , retains the biggest conquered colony on earth in its western region .
The Japan - US versus China and danger of Japanese nationalism arguments have been advanced on this site - despite the probability that the last thing Washington wants is a clash between Beijing and Tokyo .
The announcement of the Abe - Hu meeting , which will be accompanied by a meeting between the Chinese leaders and the South Korea president , puts a rather different complexion on things .
Headline nationalism appears to be retreating in the face of the understanding by both Japan and China that their best interest will be served by getting on .
That is backed by a huge joint economic interest - Japan is China 's second biggest trading partner and Japanese companies have seen profits boosted by using the mainland as a cheap assembly line .
The record of Japan from the Meiji Restoration is , indeed , one to regard with a mixture of fear and loathing .
The behaviour of its forces during the war with China in 1894 - 5 was as brutal as it was efficient , including a pre - echo in Port Arthur of the Nanjing Incident of 1937 .
The conduct of the Kwantung and Imperial armies in China from the staged "" incident "" in Manchuria in 1931 until the final surrender in 1945 is as appalling as that of any nation in the 20th century - horrific as it was the Rape of Nanjing was only part of a record of Japanese slaughter , indiscriminate bombing , murder , rape , pillage , germ warfare and savagery - not to mention the atrocities in South East Asia .
But - and you can tell , no doubt , that I was leading to a but - let me put six questions in answer to the conventional wisdom : 1 .
Is the past a guide to the future ?
Have the Japanese not learned anything since 1945 ?
Yes , their leaders go to the shrine , but polls show 51 % saying the prime minister should not visit the shrine and only 31 % saying he should .
Japan 's governing Liberal Democratic party may have made the deplorable tactical decision that it can maximise support among those nostalgic for the days of aggression , but that does not mean a majority of Japanese are lining up to go to pay their respects to Tojo .
2 .
Yes , the new prime minister strikes a note of national pride .
Elsewhere , that would be seen as a sign of a new administration setting out its stall .
Normal politics for a man who wants to be the bright youngish face of his country and live up to the Koizumi inheritance which drawing on the votes of the right .
Not nice , for sure , but quite normal democratic politics .
Beijing , meanwhile , is equally proud of China and turns nationalism on and off as it wishes .
3 .
For decades , a complaint by politicians , officials , thinktanks , comment writers and others has been that Japan was evading its political responsibilities by adopting too low a profile , Now Abe wants to put that right , he gets the brickbats .
4 .
Far from wanting Japan to provoke trouble in East Asia , Washington 's main aim is to get Tokyo and Beijing to lie down together , and neutralise the Taiwan issue .
5 .
Behind the political rhetoric , Japan needs China as its assembly shop and China needs Japan as its second biggest trading partner .
There are plenty of flashpoints , and plenty of bumps on the road - and under the sea over energy deposits .
Old enmities may prevail .
The weekend meeting will , at best , be only a tentative start - but , at the least , it is a start which may aroused feelings of relief and anxiety in Washington - a Sino - Japanese entente would challenge the post-1945 US military supremacy in the region .
But , coming from his impeccably rightwing and , yes , nationalist background , could Abe be the man to do with China what Nixon did with Mao back in the 1970s ?"
2006-10-08,"Japan and China set aside their historical differences yesterday to condemn North Korean plans for a nuclear bomb test and agreed to work to prevent a further escalation of hostilities in north - east Asia .
The new Japanese prime minister , Shinzo Abe , said that in the first formal summit between the leaders of the two countries since 2001 he had agreed with the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , that Pyongyang 's announcement last week was unacceptable .
The regime declared on Tuesday that it would test a nuclear bomb , but it did not give a date .
"" We need to prevent a nuclear North Korea , "" Mr Abe said .
"" We saw eye to eye that the North Korean announcement of its intent to conduct a nuclear test can never be tolerated because it was a great threat to the peace and security of east Asia and the international community . ""
Chinese diplomats were more cautious about publicly condemning Pyongyang - an old ally of Beijing - but in a joint statement issued after the summit , the two sides "" expressed deep concern "" over the threatened test .
The unity was welcomed by Mr Abe as a step forward .
"" I assume that the North Koreans are watching very intently this summit meeting here in Beijing , "" he said .
"" That we came out with a very strong message was very significant . ""
Both leaders called on North Korea to return to six - nation talks aimed at resolving the four - year standoff .
Breaking with a tradition that Japanese prime ministers make their first state visit to the United States , Mr Abe chose Beijing as his first overseas destination since taking power last month .
Despite his nationalist reputation , Mr Abe tried to placate his hosts by emphasising that he was the first prime minister to be born after the war and said he wished to build a relationship of trust . ""
Sixty years of Japan 's post - war history is built on our deep remorse for our country inflicting grave damage and suffering that left scars on the people of Asia , "" he said .
"" I feel certain that my visit to China this time will lead Sino - Japanese ties to a higher level . ""
"" Your visit is serving as a turning point in China - Japan relations and I hope it will also serve as a new starting point for the improvement and development of bilateral ties , "" China 's Xinhua news agency quoted President Hu as telling the Japanese leader ."
2006-10-09,"Japan 's new prime minister , Shinzo Abe , has wasted little time in making his mark , particularly in foreign policy .
His official visits to China and South Korea - two key countries with which relations suffered under the administration of Junichiro Koizumi - came within a week of his taking office and at a moment of crisis , with North Korea setting off an underground nuclear blast .
That Prime Minister Abe and the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , agreed that a North Korean nuclear test "" can not be tolerated "" suggests that this new activism may help to stabilise Asian security .
As Abe made clear when he delivered the prime minister 's general policy speech late last month , his focus on foreign policy is set to intensify .
But , while Abe 's commitment to what he describes as "" future - oriented "" relations with China and South Korea represents a welcome departure from the Koizumi government 's record , his policy agenda in fact implies considerable continuity with Japan 's heightened focus on diplomacy and security issues .
In particular , emphasising a "" shift to more assertive diplomacy "" , Abe 's policy speech cited Japan 's initiative in proposing sanctions against North Korea to the UN security council , and its success in overseeing - through close coordination with the United States and other countries - the resolution 's unanimous adoption .
At the same time , he indicated his intention to advance diplomacy aimed at strengthening the solidarity among Asian nations , founded on "" the Japan - US alliance for the world and for Asia "" .
Abe also stressed his intention to boost ties with Russia , promote cooperation with the countries in the region , and develop a strategic dialogue with Australia and India .
Likewise , under Abe , Japan will develop its official development assistance , seek to secure stable energy supplies , and pursue permanent membership of the UN security council .
Toward North Korea , on the other hand , continuity will prevail , with Abe re - emphasising the principle that normalisation of relations requires resolution of abduction cases - some dating to the 1970s - involving Japanese citizens who were seized from coastal towns .
At the same time , Japan will remain committed to the six - party talks on North Korea 's nuclear program .
Abe recognises the new challenges posed by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism , and has acknowledged the rising expectation , at home and abroad , that Japan 's contribution to international security must grow .
Most importantly , he has proposed exercising the right collective self - defence on a case - by - case basis - thus far barred by the article 9 of Japan 's constitution - in order to maintain peace and promote effective functioning of the Japan - US alliance .
Abe says that he would "" expect "" the early adoption of the referendum law needed to amend the constitution .
Abe 's choice of personnel clearly reflects his focus on diplomatic and security issues .
Yasuhisa Shiozaki , who occupies the key position of cabinet secretary , is a long - time ally , while the foreign minister , Taro Aso , though a rival within the Liberal Democratic party ( LDP ) , shares Abe 's policy priorities .
Akio Kyuma , the director - general of the defence agency , which is expected to be transformed into the ministry of defence , was instrumental in preventing Aso 's ally , Fukushiro Nukaga , from running for LDP president .
Furthermore , Abe will seek to reorganise the prime minister 's office to reinforce its ability to function as a political headquarters that can make quick decisions on national strategy concerning diplomatic and security issues .
Thus , the prime minister 's office will more closely resemble the US White House , which he hopes will enable both countries to communicate their intentions continuously and reliably .
Based on his previous experience as cabinet secretary , Abe wants to create and operate a Japanese version of America 's national security council .
For this , he has appointed Yuriko Koike , a former cabinet member , as one of his five assistants , while one of the other four , Kyoko Nakayama , is responsible solely for the abduction issue .
Moreover , although the current assistants ' authority is limited , Abe plans to submit legislation aimed at strengthening the prime minister 's office , including an amendment of the cabinet law .
This would enable the prime minister 's assistants to "" command and instruct "" the relevant ministries and agencies .
Abe 's government may also review to increase the number of staff to which the assistants are entitled .
All of this has given rise to depictions of the Abe administration as a "" cabinet of hawks "" or "" the buddy club "" .
Nevertheless , its popular support is the third highest since the end of World War II , with a rating of 63 % according to one national poll and 70 % according to another .
This implies that Abe enjoys a strong mandate to implement his government 's policies .
But high expectations , both domestically and internationally , can lead to huge disappointments .
If Abe is to create the "" beautiful country "" that he promised in his policy speech , he must not lose momentum in exercising strong leadership ."
2006-10-19,"International pressure was mounting on North Korea today to abandon plans to conduct another nuclear test as a Chinese presidential envoy met the regime ’s leader , Kim Jong - il , while the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , arrived in Seoul to bolster regional support for UN sanctions .
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman confirmed that Tang Jiaxuan , a state councillor , had flown to Pyongyang yesterday to deliver a message from the Chinese president , Hu Jintao .
“
This is a very significant visit , against the backdrop of major changes on the Korean peninsula , ” Liu Jianchao said , adding that he did not know the contents of the message .
Ms Rice , meanwhile , was expected to apply pressure on South Korea to support the sanctions regime agreed last weekend by the UN security council after the North detonated a nuclear bomb on October 9 .
The US is known to be irritated by South Korea ’s perseverance with its “ sunshine ” policy of economic engagement with the Pyongyang regime , although signs emerged today that Seoul was ratcheting up the pressure on its neighbour .
The Yonhap news agency reported that South Korea was about to cut off funding for a joint tourism venture with the North and would step up inspections of cargo and North Korean ships .
It was also considering a ban on shipments of emergency aid provided after floods hit the North in July .
The region was waiting to see what success , if any , China would have in persuading Mr Kim not to conduct more tests amid signs that the regime was preparing to detonate a second nuclear bomb .
Chung Hyung - keun , a South Korean MP who sits on the country ’s intelligence committee , said the North could be preparing for as many as four more tests .
“
Checking indications coming from intelligence agencies of different countries , it is certain that the North will conduct three or four additional nuclear tests in the future , ” he said .
China is North Korea ’s biggest trading partner and longtime political ally , although its patience with Mr Kim appeared to be wearing thin after last week ’s nuclear test .
A US official travelling with Ms Rice told reporters that Washington was expecting the Chinese delegation to take a tough line with the North .
“ I ’m pretty convinced that the Chinese will have a very strong message about future tests , ” the official said .
The test has also sparked fears that North Korea may attempt to sell nuclear technology to other states and terrorist organisations .
In Washington , the US president , George Bush , said the North would face “ a grave consequence
” if it was found to be attempting to transfer nuclear technology .
“
I want ...
the leader of North Korea to understand that he ’ll be held to account , ” he said .
In the morning , Ms Rice secured Japan ’s agreement to do all it could to assist US inspections of North Korean ships for nuclear technology and materials , although Japan ’s postwar constitution , which prohibits its troops from involvement in overseas conflicts , may limit its ability to provide military backup . “
Ensuring the implementation of the UN security council resolution will lead to changing North Korean policies , ” the Japanese prime minister , Shinzo Abe , said after his talks with Ms Rice .
“
In order to do so , we will work out the details of what we can do and what we need to do on the working level .
”
In a television interview Ms Rice said Japan had a critical role to play in enforcing sanctions , despite the constitutional restraints .
“
I think there is no doubt Japan will be a strong pillar , ” she said in an interview with the public broadcaster NHK .
“
There is plenty that can be done under existing authorities .

2006-10-26,"European plane - maker Airbus today won a substantial shot in the arm with multi - billion orders for more than 200 of its single - aisle jets from China and the US .
Airbus , which has struggled to win any orders at all in recent months because of the two - year delay in deliveries of its A380 superjumbo , confirmed that China would buy 150 A320 planes worth $ 5bn ( £ 2.65bn ) and take options on 20 A350s , the new wide - bodied long - haul jet still to be launched .
The deal was signed at a lavish ceremonial in Beijing 's Great Hall of the People in the presence of French president Jacques Chirac and Chinese president Hu Jintao .
Mr Chirac , on his last visit to China before leaving office next year , delivered several more commercial agreements , including the sale of 500 Alstom freight locomotives .
The Chinese authorities also gave the final go - ahead for Airbus to build its first non - European plant - at Tianjin , near the Chinese capital .
The plant , under a joint venture , will assemble the A320s ordered by China , with output due to begin in 2009 and to reach four a month by 2011 .
Airbus , owned by aerospace and defence group EADS , also plans to build a plant in Mobile , Alabama , to assemble air - to - air refueling tankers for the US Air Force if its wins a multi - billion Pentagon order .
The A380 delays will cause a 4.8bn profits hit at EADS over the next four years while the strength of the euro threatens to wipe out Airbus 's entire profits , forcing the company to shift production out of Europe and slash costs at home by 2bn a year .
The plane - maker , which expects to outsell Boeing for the fourth year in a row this year but whose orders have been running at a third of the rate of its US rival , said American low - cost airline Skybus had signed a firm order to buy 65 A319 single - aisle planes .
It has feared cancellations among the 159 orders for its superjumbo and needs to sell 420 A380s to break even on the 12bn project while it has yet to give the go - ahead for the A350 , a rival to Boeing 's soaraway 787 Dreamliner which will cost up to 10bn to develop ."

The Chinese want their $ 40bn annual trade with Africa to grow to $ 100bn by 2020 .
Beijing also won African backing for its "" one - China "" policy of reunification with Taiwan .

Associated Press in Beijing Four - finned dolphin hands science some clues
A bottlenose dolphin caught last month off western Japan has an extra set of fins , providing further evidence that ocean - dwelling mammals once had four legs and lived on land , researchers said .
The fins are about the size of adult human hands .
The dolphin is nearly 9 ft long and about five years old .
Researchers think this is the first found with well - developed , symmetrical extra fins .
Fossils indicate that dolphins and whales were four - footed animals about 50 m years ago but evolved into an aquatic lifestyle and lost their hind limbs .
A freak mutation may have caused the trait to reassert itself .

2006-11-13,"George Bush may be damaged goods politically after the US midterm elections , but a red - carpet welcome nonetheless awaits the US president in Vietnam this week .
Mr Bush and other world leaders , including President Hu Jintao of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia , will be feted by the Vietnamese leadership at a summit meeting of the 21-member Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( Apec ) forum in the capital Hanoi starting on Friday .
For Vietnam , hosting the biggest international event in its history , the occasion marks the latest step in its transformation from a war - ravaged country and isolated economic weakling to Asia 's newest economic tiger .
The Apec conference follows hot on the heels of Vietnam 's admission this week into the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) as the club 's 150th member , embedding the country firmly within the global economy .
Some economists are already describing Vietnam , with its population of 83 million , as the next China , albeit on a smaller scale .
The accolades are not out of place .
Since it started freeing up its economy in the late 1980s , tentatively at first and more purposefully in the last few years , Vietnam has made impressive gains .
Economic growth has averaged 7.8 % a year between 2001 and 2005 , increasing in each of the past three years - only China has grown faster .
As impressive , if not more so , has been Vietnam 's success in reducing poverty ( people living on less than $ 1 day ) , which has declined to under a fifth of the population of the population in 2004 , from 58 % in 1993 .
In one of the most telling signs of increasing prosperity , those Vietnamese who can afford it now send their children to be educated abroad .
Ironically , the US , with which Vietnam was at war for 10 years , is a favoured destination for the children of Vietnam 's growing middle class .
A booming economy has attracted foreign money .
Foreign direct investment exceeded $ 5bn ( £ 2.6bn ) in the first nine months of this year , with companies such as Intel and Canon building factories in the country .
Joining the WTO after 11 years of tough negotiations was a very big step for Vietnam .
Vietnamese garments and textiles will be no longer subject to quotas from the EU and the US , though Vietnam will be careful to avoid to provoke protectionist sentiment by attacking foreign markets too aggressively .
Vietnam will be particularly careful with the US as it is seeking a bilateral trade deal with Washington .
Still , membership should give an economic boost to Vietnam , offering it further opportunities of increasing exports to and attracting foreign investment from other WTO members .
Local media talk excitedly about annual export revenues hitting $ 100bn in the next five or seven years , up from more than $ 32bn last year .
But Vietnamese leaders have to be careful not to over - sell the benefits of WTO membership , as there will inevitably be losers as well as winners .
WTO accession , which means reducing tariffs and giving greater access to foreign companies , will expose domestic firms to greater competition .
"" In the competition , some firms and commodities will fail , "" the Vietnamese deputy prime minister , Nguyen Sinh Hung , said recently , adding that he was concerned about the competitiveness of local agricultural , forestry and fishery products , which affect most of the country 's population .
About two - thirds of Vietnamese people work in agriculture , which makes up about a fifth of the country 's annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
Other sectors will also come under foreign pressure as new companies move in , particularly in banking , insurance and financial services .
State - owned domestic companies , still steeped in the old central - planning mentality , will no longer be shielded and will have to fight to survive against more sophisticated rivals .
Moreover , as the IMF warned in a recent report , maintaining the current pace of economic growth , crucial as it is , is not enough .
"" Growth must come with equity and must include all regions and groups in the country , "" the IMF said .
"" The majority of the poor in Vietnam are isolated - geographically , ethnically , linguistically , socially and economically .
Experience in other countries shows that the real benefits of growth touch these disadvantaged groups little , if at all . ""
The issue of equity inevitably touches on corruption , a perennial complaint from ordinary Vietnamese .
The government seems unable or unwilling to grasp this particular nettle , though it fears that pervasive corruption will undermine its legitimacy and discourage investment despite WTO membership .
Only in April , a corruption scandal led to the exit of a cabinet minister .
But Vietnam 's leaders will no doubt accentuate its recent accomplishments in soporific speeches to Mr Bush , other political leaders and executives .
The message for Vietnamese will be "" it 's a hard slog ahead "" , but then they are used to hard challenges .
The former deputy prime minister Vu Khoan , who was in charge of Vietnam 's WTO negotiations told a Vietnamese newspaper recently : "" We now have to roll up our sleeves to complete the journey .
Work to be done in the post - WTO entry period is like farming on a vast rice field .
We will have to plough and harvest altogether ; otherwise , we can not enjoy a bumper crop . """
2006-12-02,"Before it happened our local Superintendent of Police called me to his office twice and tried to advise me to keep silent .
But when everything failed he slapped an official detention order on me saying I could n't leave Dharamsala for 14 days .
Hu Jintao , President of the People 's Republic of China , was visiting India and the host government had to keep me away from their diplomatic display of friendship and desire for business contracts - fearing I might repeat my protest stunts by inviting myself to their banquet table shouting "" FREE TIBET "" .
The order states that I was detained due to my protests in 2002 and 2005 ─ when Chinese Prime Ministers Zhu Rongji and Wen Jiabao visited India - and also on "" substantial evidence "" of plans to protest this time and add Hu Jintao to the list .
For the 10 April 2005 caper , I hid myself on the balcony of the bell tower atop India 's premier science institution for 24 hours .
I had climbed the building the night before China 's Prime Minister was to address a conference in the Indian Institute of Science .
So , as Wen Jiabao started his speech on the ground floor , I emerged onto the tower 's balcony brandishing the Tibetan national flag shouting "" FREE TIBET "" .
By then unfurling a huge red banner reading "" FREE TIBET "" and flinging leaflets in the air , the massive media coverage meant to focus on the Chinese premier was instantly redirected to Tibet .
India was therefore worried that the nation 's security might be breached for the third time .
So 15 policemen in plainclothes with four cars and two motorbikes were deployed to observe my activities .
The police joined me everywhere - in the toilet , at meetings , to restaurants , and even watched me buy the morning 's newspapers .
At our police headquarters I had my mug shot taken twice to be circulated , along with the detention notice , to all police stations in Himachal Pradesh state , not to mention Agra , Delhi and Mumbai - the cities
Hu was to visit .
By then I was finding everything amusing since I live frugally and save rupees by always walking up and down the hill roads in this district of the lower Himalayas .
And suddenly there are all these cops following me .
My Tibetan friends started calling them my "" bodyguard "" .
By then the news of my detention was spreading like wildfire across all the media .
Letters of support were pouring in from all corners of the world .
Young Tibetans were inspired and fired by the detention notice and so my friends were saying , "" Let 's all go to Delhi if Tsundue ca n't "" .
Then six major Tibetan NGOs banded together and orchestrated the "" Chalo Delhi "" [ "" Let 's go to Delhi "" ]
Tibetan People 's Movement to mobilize a huge gathering of Tibetans in Delhi to sit there in protest .
Then , when this was posted on the internet , Tibetans and Tibet supporters the world over sent donations to ensure the success of this spontaneous movement .
This in turn inspired me .
Creating a Tibetan Movement from within the Tibetan community has been an important focus .
And when I saw the flowering of this momentum being created before my eyes
I saw no reason to escape Dharamsala and go anywhere .
So on the day when our people were being bussed down to Delhi , I met the chief of police again and requested smooth and safe passage for those demonstrators and a guarantee of police protection for our people who would sit in protest in Delhi .
Then I decided to stay .
But I made it very clear to the police that the moment our peaceful public protest was disrupted by them we would have to play the old cat - and - mouse game .
The evening when almost a thousand emotionally - charged Tibetans gathered at McLeod Ganj square to board the buses for Delhi
, I looked at the police surrounding us .
No lathis .
No side arms .
The police hierarchy had kept their promise .
But that night they stepped - up their vigilance on me to around 20 policemen and a fleet of cars and motorbikes choking the tiny , congested square .
The protest went smoothly with police protection ; the police again kept their promise and even escorted the protestors to Delhi 's protest site .
India supported us when we lost Tibet to the Chinese invasion .
After 47 years in exile , we are once again fighting China .
India 's newfound support has resuscitated our dreams of a free Tibet .
On the other hand , India 's policy that Tibet is a part of China - the policy inherited from the British Raj - has placed India herself in a dilemma today .
We Tibetans have no political strings to pull , no money , no power , we have no crude oil to offer in exchange for help ; what we have is only history and truth .
Our struggle is based on truth , and Nonviolence is our principle of life .
For the truth we fight for we are willing to sacrifice everything - even our precious human lives ."
2007-01-31,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , begins a tour of Africa today to further encourage Beijing 's burgeoning trade with the continent while reassuring leaders China will do more than buy up its oil and minerals .
Mr Hu offered a sweetener immediately before leaving for Cameroon , the first of eight countries on his 11-day tour , by announcing $ 3bn ( £ 1.5bn ) in credit to African countries along with additional aid and interest - free loans .
China emphasised that the new money comes with none of the "" political conditions "" attached to aid from western governments .
But that has prompted concern in some countries that Chinese money encourages corruption and misrule and helps to prop up pariah regimes such as that of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe .
Among the most closely watched stops on the tour will be Mr Hu 's visit to Sudan , which has become a major oil supplier to China .
Beijing continues to sell weapons to the Khartoum government despite international condemnation of the bloodshed in Darfur , where the UN estimates 200,000 people have been killed in a conflict blamed on the Sudanese leadership .
Some foreign governments and human rights groups are watching to see if Mr Hu will use China 's influence to press Sudan 's president , Omar al - Bashir , to accept UN peacekeepers and to end government attacks on Darfur .
Still , the focus of the Chinese leader 's visit remains trade .
China 's trade with Africa last year rose by 30 % on 2005 to $ 55bn , according to Beijing .
That is a fivefold increase since 2001 and represents more trade than Africa does with the EU .
Africa 's attraction to China is natural resources , particularly oil .
A third of the oil fuelling China 's economic boom comes from Africa .
The single largest supplier to Beijing is Angola .
But the World Bank president , Paul Wolfowitz , has criticised Chinese lending to poor countries , warning that it could get them back into unmanageable debt ."
2007-03-26,"The presidents of Russia and China today increased the international pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme , calling on the country to abide by UN security council resolutions on the issue .
The joint statement agreed during talks between Vladimir Putin and the visiting Hu Jintao in Moscow , comes two days after Russia and China joined other security council members in voting for new sanctions against Iran .
Diplomatic efforts also continued elsewhere , with the EU reiterating an offer to resume negotiations and officials in Iran also stressing their desire to keep talking .
The Russian and Chinese leaders said their nations were ready to "" search for a comprehensive , long - term and mutually acceptable solution to the Iranian nuclear problem "" .
"" Russia and China also urge Iran to undertake all necessary and constructive steps to carry out the appropriate resolutions of the United Nations security council and the IAEA [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] , "" the declaration said .
Both nations believed the crisis should be resolved "" exclusively through peaceful means and negotiations "" , the statement added .
On Saturday , security council members meeting in New York agreed new sanctions , including the banning of Iranian arms exports and the freezing of assets belonging to 28 people and organisations involved in Iran 's nuclear and missile programmes .
Iran rejected the sanctions and later announced a partial suspension of cooperation with the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the IAEA .
The sanctions were drawn up by the council 's five permanent members - Russia , China , the US , Britain and France - along with Germany .
Today , the EU 's foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , renewed an offer from the six countries to negotiate with Iran in a phone call with Tehran 's top atomic negotiator .
Ali Larijani had accepted "" an invitation for future contacts "" with Mr Solana , an EU spokeswoman said .
Iran stressed it did not want to escalate tensions .
"" Iran is not after adventurism .
It does not want to violate international measures , "" said Kazem Jalali , the spokesman for the Iranian parliament 's committee on foreign policy and national security .
"" We are a member of the nuclear non - proliferation treaty , and we do n't want to make the situation more complicated , "" he said .
As permanent members , Russia and China both hold a veto in the security council , and have thus far resisted a US - led push for much harsher sanctions .
While the new measures agreed on Saturday are relatively modest , they send a further signal to Iran about international feeling over its nuclear ambitions .
Iran insists its nuclear efforts are directed purely towards civilian power uses .
The US and some of its allies fear Tehran will use uranium produced by enrichment processes to build atomic weapons .
The council imposed its first set of sanctions in December , but Iran responded by expanding enrichment ."
2007-06-08,"Huang Ju , vice premier of China and member of the politburo , China 's most powerful decision - making body , in which he ranked sixth in the hierarchy , has died in Beijing from pancreatic cancer , aged 68 .
With his thick glasses , and quiet , self - effacing demeanour , Huang was one of the least understood of the "" fourth generation "" of political leaders , gathered around President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao .
He was seen to owe his position to membership of the "" Shanghai clique "" , built around former President Jiang Zemin , to whom he was very close , and who acted as his political patron .
Rumours of his opposition to President Hu are unsubstantiated , but gained wide currency in the press in Hong Kong and abroad .
He took no pronounced position on important policy issues , and was associated with no specific campaigns .
His death will free up one space on the nine - strong politburo , in advance of the 17th Communist party congress to be held this autumn , when a raft of personnel changes are likely to be made .
Many of these are expected to cement President Hu 's hold on power , and clear the way for the new , fifth generation of leaders .
Huang was a native of the wealthy coastal province , Zhejiang .
Like many of China 's current top leaders , he was a graduate of the elite Qinghua University in Beijing , majoring in electrical engineering .
He joined the Communist party at the start of the cultural revolution in 1966 , and then moved to Shanghai , then a centre for radicalism , and base of the Gang of Four - Mao 's widow Jiang Qing and three of her close associates - the leftist leaders blamed for the cultural revolution and arrested following Mao 's death in 1976 .
Huang spent the first two decades of his career in technical positions , working in the energy sector , and gravitating toward party positions within the factories he worked in before becoming a member of the Shanghai municipal party committee .
This was a path to political power and influence followed by many others in Huang 's generation .
It was here that he caught the eye of the then Shanghai party secretary Jiang , himself also a technocrat , an outsider to Shanghai , who had cut his political teeth there .
Huang 's lack of profile belied his powerful positions .
He was the lead person in the top echelons of the Communist party in charge of finance and banking , areas that are at the heart of China 's current massive drive to modernise and develop .
For more than a decade he was in charge , first as mayor from 1991 to 1994 , then as party secretary from 1994 to 2002 , of China 's great commercial dynamo , the city of Shanghai , succeeding Zhu Rongji , who was , like him , to go on to central government .
Unlike Zhu , however , whose pugnacious , direct manner won him plaudits and support at home and abroad , Huang was perceived as an unpopular figure .
He received the lowest number of votes on his election on to the politburo in 2002 .
His initial bid for the Shanghai mayorship in 1987 was also scuppered because of the low support he received in the Shanghai municipal congress .
Such elections are simply rubber stamping processes , restricted to party members , with set candidates , and the outcome already settled .
That Huang was to receive so many votes against him was highly unusual for someone in his position , and a sign of his lack of grassroots support in the party .
Huang 's tenure in Shanghai was associated with the beginnings of a real estate scandal , which saw the eviction of thousands of residents from their homes , with little or no compensation , and which was to culminate in the eventual jailing of one of China 's richest men , Zhou Zhengyi , in 2003 for illegally acquiring state bank loans , and stock market fraud .
Scandals have continued with the removal , late last year , of Huang 's successor as party secretary , Chen Lianyu , for corruption charges .
Chen is still under house arrest .
But Huang was blamed in some quarters for helping create the environment in which such massive corruption was able to flourish .
In the past three years , rumours of Huang 's ill health circulated regularly , and his public appearances became increasingly rare .
The Communist party , however , never openly confirmed that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer , and indeed the official announcement of his death did not indicate any specific cause .
This is symbolic of the continuing secrecy of the party , and of some of its most important members .
The official obituary issued by the party noted that Huang "" was a long tested and faithful communist fighter "" .
His is survived by his wife , Yu Huiwen , and one daughter . ·

2007-07-01,"The president of China , Hu Jintao , said political reform in Hong Kong must progress in a "" gradual and orderly "" way as thousands of people took to the streets to demand more democratic accountability .
During lavish ceremonies to mark the 10th anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to China , Mr Hu emphasised the need for more patriotism and loyalty to the mainland . ""
One country , two systems can not be separated from each other , "" he said .
"" The one country means that we must uphold the power vested in the central government . ""
But his comments about democratic progress pave the way for the Hong Kong government to draw up plans for limited political reform .
In a swearing - in speech at the start of his second term , Donald Tsang , the chief executive of Hong Kong , promised to release guidelines this year that would identify the best form of universal suffrage for the territory .
He faces a difficult task of balancing the conservative instincts of the communist authorities in Beijing with the desire of the local population for change .
Polls suggest the vast majority of Hong Kong people would like full democracy immediately .
The chief executive is chosen by an 800-member commission hand - picked by Beijing , while voters elect only half of the 60 members of the legislative council , the territory 's mini - parliament .
The annual democracy rally attracted at least 6,000 people , who marched through the city centre chanting , "" One man , one vote "" , and carrying banners proclaiming , "" Democracy is not a gift from Beijing "" .
The demonstrators included trade unionists , Philippine migrant workers , campaigners for asylum seekers , defenders of a public radio station and supporters of Falun Gong , a spiritual group that is outlawed on the mainland .
The group said immigration officials turned back hundreds of followers who had tried to enter from Taiwan ."
2007-08-17,"China has ordered its media to report only positive news and imprisoned a pro - democracy dissident amid a clampdown on dissent ahead of the most important meeting of the Communist party in five years .
Media controls have been tightened , Aids activists detained and NGOs shut down as the president , Hu Jintao , prepares for the 17th party congress , when the next generation of national leaders will be unveiled in a politburo reshuffle .
Chen Shuqing - a founder member of the banned China Democracy party - suffered the toughest punishment meted out so far when he was found guilty yesterday of "" inciting people to overthrow the government "" .
The intermediate people 's court in Hangzhou , Zhejiang province , sentenced him to four years in prison .

International civil rights groups say the rules are a new threat to press freedom . ""
This crackdown is a legal gun to the head to responsible journalists who want to report on the basis of facts , "" said Sophie Richardson , deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch .
"" China has a long track record of using similar campaigns to weed out news that the authorities find objectionable because it exposes social and political problems . ""
In recent decades , China has gone through cycles of media opening and repression .
Since president Hu came to power five years ago , there have been steps backward - such as the jailings of several prominent journalists - and steps forward , including the easing of restrictions on foreign correspondents at the start of this year .
But as was the case ahead of the last party congress in 2002 , the leadership has reverted to bunker mode .
Aids activists are also feeling the pressure .
In Henan yesterday , the police shut down two offices of China Orchid Aids Projects , saying that they were part of an illegal organisation .
Earlier this month , Li Dan , the director of the group , was detained for 24 hours and a planned conference about the legal rights of people infected with HIV cancelled .
Meg Davis , founder of the Asia Catalyst organisation that was to have participated in the conference , said China 's leaders were excessively anxious ahead of the congress and the Olympics . ""
Groups like China Orchid Aids Projects are among the best and the brightest in the world .
China should be showing them off , not shutting them down , "" she said .
"" We ca n't sit on our hands and stop fighting Aids for a year because of a sporting event . """

2007-08-27,"Russia and China have been holding joint military manoeuvres in the presence of both Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese president Hu Jintao .
But a new strategic alliance between the two countries is not likely , as it is China that poses the greatest strategic threat to Russia , although many in the Kremlin seem blind to this as they rattle sabres at America and the west .
China , for instance , has territorial claims on parts of Russia 's far east which are often noted in Chinese school geography textbooks .
This is consistent with the Chinese strategic concept of "" vital space "" , which includes all spheres of a state 's strategic activities , on land , at sea , under water , in the air , and in space .
The dimensions of "" vital space "" are determined by a country 's economic , scientific , technical , social , and military capabilities - in essence , its "" total power "" .
According to Chinese theorists , the "" vital space "" of great powers extends far beyond a state 's borders , whereas the "" vital space "" of weak countries is limited to strategic boundaries that do not always correspond to the borders of their national territory .
Today , China has territorial claims against 11 of its 24 neighbours , including India , Japan , Vietnam , and the Philippines , in addition to Russia .
In China 's relations with all of them , the potential use of military force was and remains an important factor .
In September 2006 , the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) conducted an unprecedentedly large 10-day exercise , involving the Shenyang and Beijing military districts , the two most powerful of China 's seven military districts .
Shenyang abuts the Russian Armed Forces ' Far Eastern District , and the Beijing district shares a border with Russia 's Siberian Military District .
During the exercises , Shenyang units advanced 1,000 kilometres into the Beijing district , where they engaged in joint war games .
To military observers , the Beijing / Shenyang exercises seemed to be practice for a possible offensive operation against Russia , because exercises on such a scale are undertaken only at the final stage of a multi - year programme to train troops to enact specific strategic and operational plans .
The geography of the exercises , and the offensive nature of the tasks undertaken , leaves little doubt that Russia was cast in the role of "" potential adversary "" .
Such a show of force is an ancient , traditional Chinese political technique .
Paradoxically , these exercises were undertaken during a period when bilateral political and economic ties appeared on the surface to be at their highest point .
Russia has an important place in Chinese geopolitical calculations , as a supplier of both modern weaponry and energy resources needed to continue its modernisation .
Therefore , the Chinese are doing everything possible to strengthen their economic and political position in Russia , and to draw Russia into their sphere of influence .
And China is succeeding , most importantly , by consistently reinforcing Putin 's anti - American and anti - western agenda .
While the Beijing / Shenyang exercise should have indicated to Russian leaders that China 's intentions toward Russia may not always be benign , Russia 's political and military leadership seem not to sense any threat ; on the contrary , they continue to sell advanced weapons to the Chinese .
Russia 's current diplomatic tilt , indeed , is clearly against its own long - term national security interests .
China will never be interested in Russia 's economic and political modernisation , for it prefers Russia to remain a source of mineral and energy resources and a vast "" strategic rear "" in its looming challenge with the United States .
Likewise , the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) , which just concluded its annual meeting , is in China 's eyes a tool of regional policy that helps strengthen China 's influence and control over Central Asia 's natural resources at the expense of Russia .
No nation threatens China 's land borders .
China can solve its domestic problems , such as separatism , by itself .
China is militarily self - sufficient and needs military cooperation under the SCO framework only in order to free its hands if any conflict should arise that affects its interests .
In fact , conflict between Russia and China is possible precisely in Central Asia , given the clear differences in the two countries ' economic and political interests in that region .
Aside from control of the region 's energy supplies , water has become a potential source of conflict , given China 's serious shortages .
Yet , while the Chinese clearly understand these contingencies and are preparing themselves to deal with them diplomatically and militarily , the Kremlin remains myopically obsessed with the phantom threat of America .
Thus , as the Kremlin dreams of re - establishing its domination over what Russians refer to as the "" near abroad "" ( Ukraine , Belarus , the Baltic countries , and the other post - Soviet states ) , China is increasingly looking at Russia as its own "" near abroad . ""
Will the Kremlin finally wake up to this ?
Thirty - six years ago , Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong turned world politics upside down , as both America and China realised that it was the Soviet Union , and not each other , that posed the greater threat .
Vladimir Putin needs his own "" Nixon moment "" .
Alienating the west is a foolish strategy when the greatest long - term threat to Russia comes from the east .

2007-09-05,"When the presidents of the world 's remaining superpower and the nation fast challenging for the title , George Bush of the United States and Hu Jintao of China , meet in Sydney tomorrow they had been scheduled to be talking about matters of mutual interest : trade and global warming .
Now , even if not on the formal agenda , both sides are likely to be considering the prickly issue of cyber warfare , following the revelation that the Pentagon suffered a major breach by hackers reportedly working for the Chinese military earlier this year .
Disclosure by the Financial Times that the People 's Liberation Army , or PLA , assaulted part of the Pentagon 's system used by policy advisers to the defence secretary , Robert Gates , is the latest and potentially most serious breach and set alarm bells ringing across the US military .
The Pentagon reportedly resisted the PLA onslaught for several months , but was finally penetrated , forcing a shutdown of that part of its network for a week .
A spokesman would not comment on the assault or its source , but emphasised that any information obtained would have been unclassified .
The timing of the attack , and the apparent involvement of the PLA , points to an escalation of anxiety in governments across the world .
Cyber warfare began with individuals , spread to criminal gangs , and is now reaching the realm of nation states .
The Chinese government denied the allegations but , tomorrow 's presidential meeting aside , Beijing is already on the defensive over its cyber activities .
Last week Angela Merkel raised the issue of cyber warfare on an official visit to China , exhorting the government to "" respect a set of game rules "" .
The German chancellor 's objections followed a report in Der Spiegel magazine that Chinese spying software had been found widely scattered through the networks of Germany 's foreign and economic departments , and even in Mrs Merkel 's private office .
Internet security experts have been tracking Chinese cyber warfare for several years .
In 2005 , US officials revealed that sweeps of US intelligence , including flight software and aircraft plans , had been going on since 2003 .
The hackers , codenamed Titan Rain by US investigators , were believed to be in Guangdong , a province of China with a heavy concentration of PLA which was also identified by Der Spiegel as the origin of the invasion of German government networks .
Last November , the US navy reported a military computer had been attacked , probably by Chinese , though it was unclear whether the hackers were commercial or state - inspired .
In July , the state department was reportedly investigating a break - in affecting its work across the world ; it was suggested hackers had targeted anything relating to China and North Korea , though it is possible that criminal , as opposed to political or military , hackers were using that as a front to disguise their intentions .
The threat of state - sponsored hacking is dominating the thoughts of security officials around the world .
Some suggest as many as 120 countries are actively pursuing cyber warfare .
China has spelled out in a white paper that what it calls "" informationised armed forces "" are one of the three pillars of its military strategy , setting itself the target building a cyber army which could win such a war by 2050 .
The extent of cyber warfare was underlined earlier this year when the Guardian revealed that Estonia had been almost overwhelmed by an attack believed to have originated inside Russia which rendered a number of government websites useless and was described by officials as a "" very serious disturbance "" .
The US is particularly vulnerable , both because of the extent of interest in its activities around the world , and because of the sheer size of its systems .
The Pentagon operates 3.5 m computers across 65 countries , including 35 internal networks .
Its most sensitive network , Siprnet , is for secret information , and is thought never to have been hacked . Non - classified information passes through the less secure Niprnet ; it is in one segment of this network the Chinese operation is believed to have pierced .
Though the Pentagon stressed that any emails intercepted would be unclassified , that does not inherently rule out disruption .
Sami Saydjari , who worked as a Pentagon cyber expert for 13 years and now runs a private company , Cyber Defence Agency , said : "" If someone is able to attack information that is needed by decision makers , or that is crucial to organising logistics and supply lines of an army on the ground , that means they can induce chaos in a nation .
"" It is not clear exactly how the hackers gained access to the Pentagon .
It may be they deployed the principle of "" elevating privilege "" , said Dan Haagman of the computer forensics company 7Safe .
That would involve breaking into a single , unsecured computer used for mundane administrative tasks , then using its flaws to step across to other computers higher up the chain of command .
The pattern would be similar to that used by the British hacker Gary McKinnon , currently fighting extradition to the US after allegedly breaking into Pentagon and Nasa computers .
In the German case , Der Spiegel said a so - called Trojan program implanted in Microsoft Word documents and PowerPoint files had been used to infect systems .
Other ways include viruses , worms , and "" denial of service "" , where a computer system is bombarded with so much information it becomes inoperable .
"" We have gone well beyond teenagers who want their egos boosted .
We 're now into the organised kind of state activity that is truly serious , "" said Jody Westby , at CyLab based at Carnegie Mellon University .
The US strategic commander , General James Cartwright , this year gave a frank assessment in which he said that the military 's defence against cyber warfare was disjointed , passive and "" dysfunctional "" ."
2007-09-06,"The US president , George Bush , and his Chinese counterpart , Hu Jintao , had a rare face - to - face meeting at a summit in Sydney today , discussing sources of mutual tension including scares over Chinese products , trade imbalances and political freedoms . ""
He 's an easy man to talk to , "" Mr Bush said after the 90-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( Apec ) summit .
"" I 'm very comfortable in my discussions with President Hu . ""
Mr Hu called the talks "" candid and friendly "" despite their focus on issues of great sensitivity to Beijing , including recent alerts over tainted food and poisonous toys made in China .
Yesterday , the US firm Mattel announced its third major recall of Chinese - made goods in a month , calling back 750,000 toys over concerns they used paint containing too much lead .
Similar scares have hit some Chinese food exports , while in May reports about tainted Chinese - made toothpaste caused serious concern in the US .
The Chinese president "" was quite articulate about product safety and I appreciated his comments "" , Mr Bush said after their talks , declining to say more .
At a subsequent press conference with the Australian prime minister , John Howard , who was hosting the talks , Mr Hu said China was taking the issue seriously .
Beijing was "" willing and ready to work together with the international community to step up cooperation in quality inspections and examinations "" , he said .
The two leaders also discussed US concerns over the lack of religious and individual freedoms in China , Mr Bush said , adding that Mr Hu had invited him to attend the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and that he was "" anxious to accept "" .
Mr Hu also asked the US leader for help in curbing any Taiwanese moves towards independence , saying the next two years were a "" highly dangerous period "" , according to a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman .
Taiwan has enjoyed de facto independence since separating from China in 1949 when nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by the communists .
Beijing , however , has repeatedly threatened a military response if Taiwan formally declares independence .
The US is involved as Taiwan 's main protector and weapons supplier .
While relations between Washington and Beijing are officially cordial , there are other areas of contention , notably America 's worries about its massive balance of trade deficit with China .
Earlier this week there were also reports that Chinese hackers , some of them linked to the military , had gained access to Pentagon computers .
Ahead of his meeting with Mr Hu , the US president said he planned to raise trade issues , particularly Washington 's keenness for China to float its currency , the yuan , something Mr Bush said would be "" helpful in terms of adjusting trade balances "" .
The Chinese currency , which is pegged at a fixed rate to the dollar , is widely seen as being greatly underpriced despite two moves by Beijing to revalue it since 2005 .
American manufacturers complain bitterly that this makes Chinese imports unfairly cheap and US products in China more expensive .
Mr Bush and Mr Hu are the central figures at the Apec summit , an annual event for the 21-member grouping of nations from the Asia - Pacific and Americas .
Both have also been the focus of protests by local demonstrators , not that either leader would have seen the marches except on television .
Today , several hundred people marched through Sydney to protest at China 's poor human rights record .
Like other demonstrators , they were kept some distance from the Apec summit site , which is sealed off from the rest of the city by a three - mile security barrier nearly three metres high , nicknamed the "" rabble - proof fence "" ."
2007-10-13,"Forget the general election that was n't - the biggest political event of this autumn is about to take place .
The 17th congress of the Chinese Communist party starts tomorrow in Beijing .
Every important figure in communist China , ranging from city mayors to the chief executives of state - owned enterprises , will gather and politick for the next five days - and then choose a President of China to succeed Hu Jintao in 2012 .
The character and aims of China 's next President are important enough in themselves : having powered past Britain , by the end of this year , China will have overtaken Germany to become the third largest economy in the world after the USA and Japan .
It is already the world 's second military power , biggest exporter and owner of the largest foreign exchange reserves .
But as every member of this week 's congress knows , their choice has an additional and particular resonance .
They are choosing the fifth generation of Communist party leaders after the 1949 revolution .
These are no longer leaders legitimised by revolution or who have the same sense of communist mission .
They are managers and administrators who want to make the system work .
In the Soviet Union , Mikhail Gorbachev 's readiness to question communism was intertwined with his membership of the Soviet Union 's fifth generation of leaders .
He did not champion perestroika and glasnost alone ; much of the nomenklatura had decided that the Soviet economic and social model was dysfunctional , corrupt and endemically inefficient and had to change .
Will one of Hu Jintao 's two ' Lis ' , as the frontrunners to succeed him , Li Keqiang and Li Yuanchao , are popularly known , feel the same way as they walk out in front of the cameras in the Great Hall of the People on Friday ?
Will one prove to be China 's Gorbachev ?
The 2,200 or so handpicked delegates are pulled in two directions .
They are beneficiaries of enormous and rampant corruption ; Minxin Pei , director of the China programme at Washington 's Carnegie Institute , calculates that 10 per cent of the value of all land and investment deals is set aside to grease Communist party officials ' hands .
Corrupt payments stand at $ 86bn every year - and they are rising .
Pei says this poses a lethal threat to the system because of growing popular revulsion ; he is right and the leadership agrees with him .
Doubtless Hu will speak out against corruption this week , yet again .
The trouble is that , despite his rhetoric , only three in 100 corrupt officials is caught , largely because the anti - corruption campaigns are run by officials who themselves are corrupt .
Worse , nobody believes in the underlying moral purpose of communism ; old habits , including the imperial system of concubinage , are returning with a vengeance .
And this is generating a contrary pull .
A growing proportion of the Chinese nomenklatura - like the Soviet Union 's before them - knows that the system , for all its successes , is running out of time .
There is the environment , where up to 750,000 people a year die of air pollution .
There is the chronic and rising inequality between town and country with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security warning that if inequality continues to rise , it refuses to guarantee social stability after 2010 .
Then there is the economy , over - reliant on exports and investment and dependent on vast peasant savings and cheap peasant labour .
China registered only 0.3 per cent of the world 's ' triadic ' patents ( valid in Japan , the EU and US ) last year .
It is an elephantine subcontractor to the West , dependent for its competitiveness on forcing its currency to be linked to the dollar .
That means it is acquiring a stunning and unsustainable extra $ 500bn of foreign exchange reserves a year , which has helped drive Chinese inflation to a 10-year high .
Hu and the politburo are fully aware of the crisis that could engulf them and that the only viable solution is more accountability , openness and scrutiny .
The political problem is to organise more ' socialist democracy ' which may permit these good things while making sure that the process does not get out of hand with popular demands for competitive elections .
The story of this week 's party congress is how far Hu will be able to manoeuvre between the conservatives , who want to call a halt to even the smallest of reforms for fear it will lead to loss of political control , and the Dengist reformers , who know the Chinese economic and political establishment has got to subject itself to more scrutiny and the rule of law or the game is up .
Hu is on the reform side of the argument - just .
He said in June he would add calls for ' emancipating thought ' and political reform to his longstanding commitment to harmonious economic and social development and science at this week 's congress .
Over the last six months , he has permitted leading theorists in the party school to discuss the advantages of democracy .
Yanhuang Chunqui , a liberal weekly , has freely debated the issue .
In the run - up to a party congress , these are important indications .
The other question is whether Hu will succeed in getting both ' Lis ' into the politburo , the first step to the succession .
Li Keqiang is party secretary of the important industrial province of Liaoning , a former secretary of the communist youth league and on the mildly reformist Hu side of the argument .
Li Yuanchao runs the equally significant province of Jiangsu , is younger and has a track record of being a genuinely innovative reformer , pushing democratic socialism to its limits in opening up the local media , promoting the rule of law and subjecting party cadres to public examination .
He is deplored by the conservatives .
The first Li getting on the politburo would be a goodish signal ; both would be very strong .
This week comes the denouement .
Communist party politics are opaque , but the implications are no longer confined to China .
Whether it can navigate the next phase of its development without a major political and social upheaval affects us all ."
2007-10-15,"This week 's Chinese Communist party congress will be a well - ordered affair - even during the tumult of the Cultural Revolution such meetings were conducted with decorum in their customary veil of secrecy .
But the stakes behind the scenes are high and , given the global impact of the People 's Republic , are significant for people thousands of miles from Beijing .
One thing seems certain :
Hu Jintao will get a second term as party leader , and continue to grapple with the problems he has failed to surmount in his first five years in office .
The party remains intent on preserving the monopoly power it has enjoyed since 1949 .
Its leader knows it needs a serious dose of rejuvenation to make it better able to relate with the rapid changes in China 's economy and society .
He recognises that the wealth disparities and the gap between the coastal and interior regions have to be lessened , the economy brought into better balance and corruption reduced - even if his main graft targets have just happened to be political foes .
The trouble is that , for leaders of an autocratic system , Hu and prime minister Wen Jiabao have shown themselves remarkably poor at getting results .
Their Five Year Plan provides for annual growth to fall to 7.5 % ; it has gone up to more than 11 % .
The authorities urge an end to the bull market on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges ; the index has more than doubled this year .
Instead of slowing down appreciably , as pledged , the trade surplus in the first nine months of 2007 was greater than in the whole of 2006 .
Pollution targets are not met .
Wealth disparities grow .
A campaign to get corrupt official to confess produced a grand total of a couple of thousand repenters .
Now , all the signs are that the Congress is about to bring evidence of even more serious weakness at the top .
One of the main tasks of the meeting is to pick the successor who will take over the party leadership from Hu in 2012 .
( As befits a 2,200-year - old civilisation , the Chinese like to look ahead . )
Hu himself was chosen by Deng Xiaoping who also picked his predecessor , Jiang Zemin .
Hu had his candidate lined up in the shape of the party secretary of Liaoning province , Li Keqiang , a man who follows the leader 's doctrine of "" scientific socialism "" and the pursuit of a "" harmonious society "" .
Li was to be elevated to the top body , the standing committee of the politburo at the end of the congress as Hu 's doctrines were adopted to put him in the pantheon alongside Mao , Deng and Jiang .
But it does not seem to have worked out that way .
The Beijing rumour mill , based on a mixture of leaks and interpretation , has it that Li will be joined as a new member of the standing committee by another man in his fifties , probably Xi Jinping , the newly - appointed party boss in Shanghai .
Though Xi , who previously ran go - ahead Zhejiang province , is definitely identified with the coastal boom , his elevation would be not so much the product of policy differences as a matter of personal power .
Most of the other members of the standing committee simply do not want Hu to get too strong , and so have been scheming all year to promote a non - Hu figure as the potential successor .
Hu may gain some solace if Vice - President Zeng Qinghong , who represents the "" Shanghai faction "" led by Jiang Zemin , steps down from the standing committee , but at least one of his allies will be promoted and he will remain a powerful backstage influence .
At the same time , various members of the "" princelings "" group - sons of previous generation leaders - are expected to be put into important posts .
All this may smack of obscure ( if fascinating ) political manoeuvring without much relationship to the real world .
But it matters for one reason : it shows that , five years after succeeding Jiang , Hu is a leader shackled by factionalism and unable to assert himself as the job demands .
Policy formulation has been stumbling enough for the past couple of years ; implantation even more so .
Now , if the top leadership is to be the scene of jockeying for the leadership - for instance between Li and Xi - that can only get worse .
This would be particularly grave coming at a time when the regime needs to get to grips with major challenges from the wave of liquidity bred by the trade surplus to the land , water and pollution crises .
The leadership has to find ways to cut through the jungle of interest groups , administrative and provincial baronies and CCP immobilism to catch up with the economy and the deep problems spawned by growth on Dengist lines .
To make the best of a bad job , Hu 's acolytes have been putting it about that he decided not to name a successor in the interests of "" inner party democracy "" .
Greater internal discussion may indeed be needed , but , as regards picking the man for 2012 , this is altogether too sudden a switch to be credible .
For the world , the main danger may be that a long - term leadership contest will encourage chauvinism as the contenders compete to prove themselves the best nationalists .
On Taiwan , for instance , the tough PLA line is likely to prevail if only because nobody who wants to become party secretary dares forfeit the army 's backing or be seen to flinch from doing what is necessary to retrieve the island .
Overall , the prospect is that China will become even more of an empire without an emperor , headed by authoritarians without authority .
The Communist party is not going to fall , or accept significant change in its status .
China 's growth is not going to be halted , even if the growing imbalances point to a serious bump in the road ahead .
Whatever reformist ideas may be spun from think tanks and universities , the party 's will to accept them , let alone to move to implementation is hardly apparent , particularly given the spectre of the collapse of the Soviet Union and its east European empire that is held up as a terrible warning at political education sessions for cadres .
In contrast , as the fate of Wen Jiabao 's policy pronouncements demonstrates , the economy has a life of its own , driven by factors which the leadership can not control .
The outcome could be that , in place of the ordered progress to the next generation of leaders which it was meant to achieve , the 17th party congress could mark the start of a new period of instability that will pose fresh issues not just for China , but for the world beyond ."
2007-10-15,"A fifth of the world 's population will come closer to knowing the identity of their next president this week as the Chinese Communist party opens the country 's most important political meeting in five years .
A "" princeling "" from an elite family and a cadre who made his name in poor provinces are among the favourites to succeed President Hu Jintao when his term of office expires in 2012 .
At the 17th Communist party congress , which starts today , Xi Jinping , the son of a party elder , and Li Keqiang , who worked his way up from humble peasant origins , are expected to be promoted to the standing committee of the politburo , the most powerful body in China .
The elevation of this pair and two or three other fifth - generation politicians will set the stage for what analysts say could prove an unusually open succession contest .
The stakes have never been higher .
The general secretary of the Communist party is guaranteed the job of president , which means he will lead the fastest growing economy and an increasingly important player in global trade and diplomacy .
During the meeting of 2,017 delegates at Beijing 's Great Hall of the People , Mr Hu will consolidate his power by promoting supporters from his powerbase in the Communist Youth League to the politburo and its standing committee .
He is also expected to push for a reform of the party charter to include his concept of "" scientific development "" , which seeks a more environmentally sustainable and socially harmonious model of economic growth .
Analysts do not expect major initiatives , but Mr Hu may call for greater "" inner party democracy "" , which means more voting by communists for communists .
With 73 million members , the party increasingly resembles a giant aristocracy . ""
Princelings "" - the children of current and former leaders - dominate the executive ranks of many of the nation 's biggest firms .
President Hu Jintao 's daughter is married to the former head of the internet giant Sina .
The son - in - law of the prime minister , Wen Jiabao , reportedly runs the country 's most successful football team .
The son of the former premier Li Peng controls China 's biggest power generation company , while relatives of Deng Xiaoping are believed to dominate the huge Poly group .
The hereditary trend could become more pronounced if Xi Jinping , party general secretary in Shanghai , is made heir - apparent . ""
He would be the first princeling to take power .
If that is the case , then we can truly say the Communist party has become an aristocracy , "" said a diplomat .
But he is not a certainty .
At least four places are likely to open up on the politburo 's nine - member standing committee .
Mr Hu does not have the power of past party strongmen .
He must consider the interests of party factions and the wishes of his predecessor , Jiang Zemin . ""
Given the present political situation in Beijing it is impossible for Hu Jintao to be dominant in making these decision , "" said Professor Joseph Cheng of the City University of Hong Kong .
"" He will make concessions and look for a balance .
It not just factional , but a mix of people from rich coastal provinces , some from inland , some princelings , some bureaucratic experts , cadres from the communist youth league and the propaganda department . ""
Many observers believe there is no consensus .
"" By the time of the 18th party congress , there will be a real contest because Hu Jintao does not have the authority to pick his successor , "" said Li Datong , formerly an editor at a publication controlled by the Communist Youth League .
But he did not expect major reforms that would allow multi - party democracy of press freedom . ""
Hu is not that type of person .
He was educated by the party .
You can not change his brain .
He just does n't know what freedom of the press is . ""
Academics say Mr Hu will have more room for manoeuvre after he wins a second term . ""
Usually during their first term , leaders do not show their colours fully .
It is only in the second term that their ideas become fully developed and mature , "" said Cui Zhiyuan of Tsinghua University .
"" I hope that in the second term he will be more open for the media and introduce more democracy within the party . ""
The party has stifled debate ahead of the congress , clamping down on the domestic media , detaining dissidents and blocking internet sites .
Hardliners have long warned that increased accountability could take China down the road of Gorbachev 's Soviet Union , which might lead the party to self - destruct .
Professor Cui said it did not go far enough .
"" What is more important is mass democracy , more media openness and more power for the people 's congress . """
2007-10-15,"China 's president and the Communist party general secretary , Hu Jintao , promised a more open and sustainable model of development today in a speech that will set the policy of the nation for the next five years .
At the opening of the 17th Communist party congress , Mr Hu acknowledged that the ruling party had failed to live up to the expectations of the people and proposed a series of modest reforms aimed at improving the skills , morals and accountability of cadres .
The shift from quantity to quality in both party management and economic development underpins Mr Hu 's theory of "" scientific development "" , which will be written into the charter of a party that has moved from revolution to plutocracy .
More than 2,000 communist officials applauded in short bursts as Mr Hu made his speech in front of a giant hammer and sickle icon on a stage decorated with red flags and rows of central committee members in dark suits and military uniforms .
Far from the semi - religious reverence of Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolution , Mr Hu is more of a technocrat who must compromise with factions in making appointments and setting policy .
But the global significance of a party leader 's words has arguably never been greater than now because China is an increasingly important player in world trade and diplomacy .
During his first five years in power , Mr Hu said growth had averaged more than 10 % a year , making China the fourth biggest economy in the world .
He said the number of rural poor had fallen from 250 million to 20 million , the military had been modernised and the first Chinese astronauts had ventured into space .
Economic development , he said , would remain a top priority and there would be no return to the isolation of previous times . ""
To stop or reverse reform and opening up would only lead to a blind alley , "" he warned .
But , along with the list of achievements , he cited the need to address the problems of environmental degradation , political corruption and income inequality between the rich cities on the eastern seaboard and villages in the poor western interior . ""
While recognising our achievements , we must be well aware that they still fall short of the expectations of the people , "" he said in a candid moment .
"" The governance capability of the party falls somewhat short of the need to deal with the new situation and tasks . ""
Among the problems he identified were weak organisations , excessive bureaucracy and extravagance , waste and corruption by a "" small number of party cadres "" .
Last year , 8,310 of members were punished for accepting bribes , but they were just the ones who got caught .
Corruption is endemic in a system with no independent courts , no free media and no genuine electoral accountability .
Mr Hu used his 135-minute speech to amplify his theory of a "" scientific outlook on development "" , which is his contribution to the communist party 's ideological bible .
"" Our economic growth is realised at an excessively high cost of resources and the environment , "" he noted .
As well as more sustainable growth , he called for a better quality of government .
To improve the party , he called for higher levels of training for cadres and more internal accountability .
This so - called "" inner - party democracy "" would give the 73 million Communist party members in China more opportunities to vote on policies and leaders , as well as adopting a tenure system for delegates to party congresses .
But there were no major political reforms that would open the way to genuine universal , multi - party democracy .
"" We must uphold the party 's role as the core of leadership in directing the overall situation and coordinating the efforts of all quarters , "" he said .
At the end of the congress , the party will unveil a new line - up of the standing committee of the politburo - the most powerful political body in this country of 1.3 billion people .
Mr Hu will promote several supporters , but - given the lingering influence of his predecessor Jiang Zemin and the need to balance factional interests - he is also expected to have to make compromises that would have been undreamed of by his more powerful predecessors ."
2007-10-15,"President Hu Jintao was in Harold Macmillan mode yesterday , telling the people that they had never had it so good .
Under his leadership in the past five years , he said , "" China 's overall strength grew considerably and people enjoyed more tangible benefits .
China 's international standing and influence rose notably . ""
Perhaps he should be called Super - Hu .
Yet the "" trust us , all will be well "" message from the Communist party 's 17th congress is not entirely convincing .
Experts say China is entering a critical 15-month period at home and abroad .
And while Mr Hu admitted the country faced "" unprecedented challenges "" , his prescription - increased , centralised party control and vaguely worded promises of greater accountability - does not look like the answer .
External pressure on Beijing is mounting , driven by perceptions that it will do almost anything to make next year 's Olympic games a success .
The concerted international effort to induce China to get tough with its wayward client generals in Burma is but one example of this linkage .
The squeeze is on in numerous other directions .
George Bush will today become the first US president to invite the Dalai Lama to a public meeting at the White House .
The talks , following a similar move last month by Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , are a pointed signal to Beijing that , in western eyes , Tibet 's lost independence is not necessarily a lost cause .
Broader civil rights issues are coming into focus .
Human Rights Watch reported this month that internal repression , including abduction and violent intimidation , was intensifying . ""
In March , Yu Hongyuan , the Olympics security protection centre 's commander - in - chief , advocated ' harshly penalising one person in order to ... frighten many more into submission ' to ensure the success of the congress , the Games , and 60th anniversary celebrations of the People 's Republic in 2009 , "" Human Rights Watch said .
Having given ground on its support for Sudan 's government , after Darfur campaigners threatened to label the Olympics the "" Genocide Games "" , Beijing is being pushed to do more .
The US in particular is relentlessly stressing China 's responsibility as an emerging global power to cooperate on shared problems such as Iran 's and North Korea 's nuclear activities .
Slowly but surely , Beijing 's non - aligned era doctrine of non - interference and non - intervention in other countries ' affairs , born of bitter national experience , is crumbling before a mixture of realpolitik and moralistic arm - twisting .
This evolution has not gone unnoticed in Taiwan .
Not coincidentally , it mounted its first national day military parade in 16 years last week and has stepped up its bid for UN membership .
China has regularly threatened Taiwan , which it regards as a breakaway province , with attack .
But yesterday Mr Hu sounded almost conciliatory .
Internal challenges to party control are also multiplying .
After years of rapid growth , the economy shows signs of over - heating and inflation is rising .
According to Albert Keidel of the Carnegie Endowment , food prices in July rose by 15 % .
Pork went up by 90 % , instant noodles by 20 % , and cooking oil and eggs by 30 % . ""
These are explosive price increases in key consumer categories , "" he said .
"" China 's economy looks today much as it did before the inflationary catastrophes of 1988 - 89 and 1993 - 1996 ...
If inflation gets out of control , draconian steps to suppress it could cause hardship and social unrest "" .
According to Elizabeth Economy in Foreign Affairs journal , China 's severe environmental problems could yet result in a great leap backward .
She cited Pan Yue , a senior official , who warned that "" the [ economic ] miracle will end soon because the environment can no longer keep pace "" .
But Beijing 's initiatives were routinely ignored by greedy local officials , she said .
"" Turning the environmental situation around will require something far more difficult than setting targets and spending money ; it will require revolutionary bottom - up political and economic reforms . ""
As Mr Hu made very clear yesterday , change of that order is not on the cards .
It seems this great helmsman is steering with his eyes tight shut ."

Probably only Beijing has the power to insist upon a genuine reconciliation dialogue .

Precedent suggested remedial action by the Communist party would come too little , too late , Mr Keidel said .
According to Elizabeth Economy , writing in the Foreign Affairs journal , China 's escalating environmental problems could also disrupt Mr Hu 's hopes of steady national advances , resulting instead in a great leap backward .
She cited Pan Yue , a senior official , who warned that "" the [ economic ] miracle will end soon because the environment can no longer keep pace "" .
Large - scale air and water pollution , desertification and the illegal timber trade endangered the health and livelihood of many millions , Ms Economy said .

"" Turning the environmental situation around will require something far more difficult than setting targets and spending money .

2007-10-16,"President Hu Jintao admitted yesterday that China 's Communist party had failed to live up to the expectations of the people and promised a more sustainable and accountable policy of development .
In a speech that will set China 's direction for the next five years , Mr Hu spoke of the need to address the problems of environmental degradation , political corruption and income inequality between the rich cities on the eastern seaboard and villages in the poor western interior .
Mr Hu was speaking at the opening of the 17th Communist party congress - the most important political event in China since the last congress in 2002 - at a time when the leader 's words have never carried more weight in the outside world .
Boasting of an average growth rate of more than 10 % a year since taking power , Mr Hu vowed to continue the reforms that had pushed China past Britain to become the fourth biggest economy . ""
To stop or reverse reform and opening up would only lead to a blind alley , "" he warned .
In the political sphere , he held out the prospect of only limited changes , none of which would challenge the one - party system .
An expansion of "" inner party democracy "" will give 73 million party members more opportunities to vote on policy and leadership , introduce a tenure system for delegates to congress and make the decision making process more open to scrutiny .
For most of the 1.3 billion population , there was no clear timetable for an expansion of accountability beyond choosing village chiefs , the lowest level of government . ""
Citizens ' participation in political affairs will expand in an orderly way , "" he said .
"" Power must be exercised in the sunshine to ensure that it is exercised correctly . ""
During his time in office , Mr Hu said the number of rural poor had fallen from 250 million to 20 million , the military had been modernised and the first Chinese astronauts had ventured into space .
But , after record levels of protests in the countryside , he admitted that the party had struggled to keep pace with the rapid changes in society . ""
While recognising our achievements , we must be well aware that they still fall short of the expectations of the people , "" he said .
"" The governance capability of the party falls somewhat short of the need to deal with the new situation and tasks . ""
Among the problems he identified were weak grass - roots organisations , excessive bureaucracy , and waste and corruption by a "" small number of party cadres "" .
Last year , 8,310 members were punished for accepting bribes , but that figure accounts only for those who were caught and corruption is endemic .
Mr Hu used the 135-minute speech to amplify his theory of a "" scientific outlook on development "" , which will be written into the party charter .
It represents a change of focus from quantity to quality in national governance , and from revolution to plutocracy in party ideology .
Instead of merely aiming for high growth , it emphasises sustainability and social harmony .
"" Our economic growth is realised at an excessively high cost of resources and the environment , "" Mr Hu noted .
He made his speech in front of a giant hammer and sickle symbol .
But decades after the semi - religious reverence of Mao Zedong , the former hydro - engineer relies less on ideology and charisma and more on asserting his qualities as a pragmatic manager .
Mao 's theory of class struggle , he said , was an erroneous theory .
Mr Hu held out an olive branch to Taiwan .
"" We would like to make a solemn appeal : On the basis of the one - China principle , let us discuss a formal end to the state of hostility between the two sides , reach a peace agreement , "" he said .
"" We are willing to make every effort with the utmost sincerity to achieve peaceful reunification of the two sides and will never allow anyone to separate Taiwan from the motherland in any name or by any means . ""
Taiwan 's government rejected the overture as "" devoid of significance "" .
At the end of the congress , the party will unveil a new line - up of the standing committee of the politburo , China 's most powerful political body .
Mr Hu will promote several supporters , but given the influence of his predecessor Jiang Zemin and the need to balance factional interests , he is also expected to make compromises that would have been undreamed of by past leaders ."
2007-10-17,"Much that President Hu Jintao said as he opened the 17th party congress in Beijing on Monday was hard to disagree with .
China 's Communist party has failed to live up to the expectations of its people .
It is not tackling either the environmental or social consequences of an annual growth rate of 10 % .
Corruption is endemic .
The gap between rich and poor is growing and so too is the imbalance between booming cities on the eastern seaboard and grinding rural poverty in the western interior .
All of this is true and the leadership have been warning about such things for much of the past decade .
The issue is not the diagnosis but the cure .
Ever since China 's central government devolved responsibility for social services , health and education down the chain of command , local authorities have used contracts with entrepreneurs as a way of offsetting the burden of paying for these services .
They have not been able to sell land , but they have privatised its use .
Lucrative contracts for high - rise developments that concrete over scarce arable land feed corruption .
The party says that it punished over 97,000 members last year , and staged show trials of highly placed miscreants , but it still can not master the problem .
Mr Hu made only the most cursory of nods to political changes that challenge the one - party system and gave no timetable for expanding direct accountability beyond the election of village chiefs , the lowest level of government .
But he did use a curious phrase .
He said power must be exercised "" in the sunshine "" to ensure that it is exercised correctly .
If he was not prepared to loosen the party 's monopoly on power , he did envisage an expansion of "" inner party democracy "" which would give 73 million party members more opportunities to vote on policy and leadership .
What this means in reality is unclear .
As Mr Hu spoke , the two most widely tipped prospective members of the new politburo , Xi Jinping , party boss of Shanghai , and Li Keqiang , boss of the Liaoning province , were lined up at the front of the Praesidium , their physical proximity to the source of power an indicator of their bright political prospects .
Some habits die hard .
China is changing more rapidly than the party can cope with .
If it is to address the quality of economic growth , rather than merely its quantity , Mr Hu must also look outside the party to the growing ranks of professionals , campaigning lawyers and environmentalists for help .
Chinese non - governmental organisations are tolerated on a local level as long as they do not form national associations .
It is surely time to tap China 's civil society , rather than view it as a challenge to one - party control ."
2007-10-21,"The Chinese president Hu Jintao 's most powerful rival in the politburo has been pushed into retirement in a reshuffle of the communist party 's inner sanctum .
Zeng Qinghong , the vice - president , was among three of the party 's most senior cadres who lost their places on the new central committee unveiled yesterday at the close of the 17th party congress .
Although Zeng has avoided friction with Hu , his departure is seen as a boost to the president , who secured his second five - year term by winning 2,233 of the 2,235 votes in the tightly controlled selection process .
It will allow Mr Hu to replace almost half of the nine - member politburo standing committee , which will be announced within the next two days .
Mr Zeng is a party strongman , who previously held the reins of the powerful organisational department and maintained strong ties to the military and the propaganda apparatus .
A rocket - scientist turned politician from Jiangxi province , he rose to prominence as an aide to the previous president , Jiang Zemin , who has exerted considerable power behind the scenes since he stood down in 2002 .
But the congress strengthens Mr Hu 's authority .
As well as promoting more allies into the central committee , the leader has secured inclusion of his concept of "" scientific development "" in the party charter .
The process is far from democratic .
The delegates to congress are carefully picked and they have little choice .
In the election of a new central committee of 204 members , only about 20 of the candidates failed to secure a post .
Most of the senior cadres who were not reappointed were past retirement age .
Chief among those tipped for senior positions when the new line - up is announced are Li Keqiang , party boss of Liaoning province , and Xi Jinping , party secretary in Shanghai .
But the president will not have it all his own way .
In making appointments , he will also have to take into account the wishes of factions ."
2007-10-22,"China was introduced today to the two new recruits to the Communist party leadership anointed as the likely leaders of the world 's most populous nation from 2012 .
Xi Jinping , a "" princeling "" from an elite family , and Li Keqiang , the son of a low - ranked rural official , were propelled into the highest echelons of the Communist party after protracted backroom dealing that will shape policy and personnel for a generation .
The duo joins the politburo standing committee , the most powerful body in China , in a reshuffle aimed at consolidating the authority of the party leader and state president , Hu Jintao .
At the 17th party congress , which ended at the weekend , Mr Hu secured his second five - year term as leader and had his concept of "" scientific development "" written into the party charter .
The president has had difficulty implementing his policies of environmental protection , redistribution of wealth and clean government because power is diffused among provinces and factions .
The reshuffle only partially strengthens his hand .
Out went his biggest rival , Vice - President Zeng Qinghong and two other senior cadres who were close to Mr Hu 's predecessor , Jiang Zemin .
But the factional bloodlines of both newcomers suggest Mr Hu will still have to make compromises .
Of the four new appointees , only one - Mr Li - is a pure Hu protege .
Like the president , Mr Li worked his way to the top by running some of China 's poorest provinces , and exploiting his connections in the Communist Youth League .
Mr Li had been tipped as Mr Hu 's most likely successor in 2012 , but a rival whose different background underscores the divisions inside this fast - changing society has since eclipsed him .
Mr Xi is the son of a party elder , the husband of a famous singer and - until today - the party boss of the commercial capital , Shanghai .
An engineering and law graduate of Tsinghua University
, he has a reputation as a talented troubleshooter with close connections to business and foreign investors .
He is seen as a compromise candidate because he is close to both Mr Hu and Mr Jiang .
At the public unveiling at the Great Hall of the People , Mr Xi was introduced ahead of Mr Li , suggesting he will be the next president , with the latter the next prime minister .
But some analysts have suggested both men are so closely matched that there could be a genuine leadership contest at the next congress .
Both are in their 50s , well below the all - male standing committee 's average age of 62 .
Underlining that both men are chosen ones , Mr Hu went out of his way to give a special introduction . ""
Xi Jinping , 54 , and Li Keqiang , 52 , are two comrades who are relatively younger , "" he said .
The two other new members - Zhou Yongkang , who takes the helm of the public security ministry , and He Guoqiang , who is in charge of party discipline - are seen as closer to Jiang - Zeng camp .
The continued influence of the former president was further underlined when two scandal - tainted cadres close to Mr Jiang retained their posts .
Jia Qinglin , who was implicated in a bribery and corruption case , stays on at No 5 in the hierarchy .
Li Changchun , who was party chief of Henan province during the outbreak and attempted cover - up of the HIV - contaminated blood scandal , retains his grip on the powerful propaganda department ."
2007-10-22,"Hu Jintao Paramount leader of the People 's Republic of China Born in Anhui in 1942 , Hu Jintao joined the CPC during the Cultural Revolution , whilst studying hydroelectric engineering at Qinghua University .
He began his working life in Gansu province , rapidly progressing in the Ministry of Water , Conservancy and Power .
As his political career took off , at first serving in the Youth League , then later acting as party chief for Tibet and Guizhou , he gained experience working in some of China 's poorest regions .
In 1992 he become the youngest ever member of the CPC central committee .
He has been general secretary since 2002 , president of China since 2003 and in 2004 succeeded Jiang Zemin as chairman of the central military commission .
His coming to power has marked the transition of Chinese rule from old - style communism to a technocracy .
Wu Bangguo Chairman of the standing committee of the 10th National People 's Congress Like Mr Hu , Wu Bangguo was also from the Anhui region and studied engineering at Qinghua .
He joined the communist party in 1964 , and began his career at factories in Shanghai .
He was recruited to work for the party and in 1983 was appointed secretary of the science and technology commission in Shanghai .
Another protégé of Jiang Zemin , he joined the politburo with Mr Hu in 1992 .
He was made chairman of the standing committee of the National People 's Congress in 2003 .
Wen Jiabao Member of the standing committee of the politburo of the CPC central committee and premier of the state council Wen Jiabao , the Chinese premier , is from Tianjin and joined the CPC in 1965 .
After studying geology to post - graduate level at the Beijing Institute of Geology , Wen Jiabao began a political career in this field and was eventually made vice - minister of geology and mineral resources .
He continued to ascend to the higher ranks of the party , but not without the occasional hiccough .
In 1989 he famously accompanied then - party secretary Zhao Ziyang to Tiananmen Square to visit the students on hunger strike .
Mr Zhao was forced to leave the party immediately , but Mr Wen survived the incident .
In his current role as premier , he has overseen the country 's economic reforms and is popular with the people .
Jia Qinglin Chairman of the 10th national committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference
Jia Qinglin is a native of Hebei .
He studied manufacturing at Hebei Engineering College and began his political life in the ministry of industry .
He moved on to work in Fujian province and became head of the party in the area in 1993 .
He was brought in to act as mayor of Beijing from 1996 , leading the city in celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic of China .
In his current role he has little power .
Li Changchun Member of the standing committee of the politburo of the CPC central committee Li Changchu is from the industrial province of Liaoning .
He studied electrical engineering then worked at factories in Shenyang .
He has been fast - tracked up the political ranks , becoming the youngest ever mayor of a major city and the youngest member of the politburo , beating Mr Hu 's record .
His work within the committee is said to be related to propaganda .
Xi Jinping Secretary of the CPC Shanghai municipal committee Son of Xi Zhongxun , a founder of the Communist guerrilla movement in northern China , Xi Jinping is from Shaanxi .
He joined the Youth League and then became a member of the party in 1974 .
He studied at Beijing University , where he gained a degree in law and completed a PhD in economics .

2007-12-18,"No , not the primaries !
The real contest is for Time magazine 's Person of the Year , who will be revealed tomorrow .
Making the short list : Al Gore , Steve Jobs , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Condoleezza Rice , Hu Jintao , David Petraeus , Vladimir Putin , and JK Rowling .
It 's a packed field , with Rowling and Gore currently leading an online survey of Time readers .
But in this year of hard - boiled politics , expect a politician to stand out .
Gore , Rice and Ahmadinejad were all short - listed last year , so any of them could be due for a make - up call .
But Rice has largely withdrawn from the world stage this year , and that NIE report stole all the thunder that a vote for Ahmadinejad would bring .
The safe money 's on Gore .

2008-02-01,"China 's president , Hu Jintao , has urged miners to step up coal production as winter storms strain fuel and power supplies .
Heavy snow , ice and winds have caused blackouts , killed at least 55 people , wiped out homes and crops and brought much of the transport system to a standstill .
While airports , rail lines and roads are beginning to return to service , the country 's infrastructure is struggling to cope with millions of migrant workers hoping to return home for Chinese new year .
Hu told miners in Shanzi , northern China : "" We hope that you can exercise your special spirit as coal workers to combat the disasters and play out the tradition of helping one another . ""
Officials have waived all tolls and restrictions on coal and food shipments .
Psychologists have also been drafted in to counsel stranded travellers in Hangzhou ."
2008-02-16,"China 's involvement in Sudan stretches back more than a decade and has snowballed to the extent that it now supplies nearly a quarter of the African country 's imports and accounts for about 70 % of its exports , mostly oil .
But despite growing global criticism of Chinese blank cheques written to the regime in Khartoum , Beijing has shifted its policy in the past 18 months .
Though President Hu Jintao announced a $ 13 m interest - free loan for a new palace for his Sudanese counterpart , Omar al - Bashir , and cancelled debt worth $ 70 m during a visit to Sudan in February last year , his government publicly called for a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement in Darfur .
A special envoy , Liu Guijin , was later appointed to help find a political solution in Darfur , and a team of 300 engineers was committed to support the peace effort .
Most significantly , analysts say , China backed security resolution 1769 , which nearly tripled the size of the peacekeeping force in Darfur to 20,000 and brought in the UN alongside the African Union , which had led the mission .
After successfully lobbying Bashir to accept the new force , China announced a $ 10 m contribution to humanitarian aid in the country .
But many experts question how much pressure China is really exerting .
Although the Chinese delegation at last month 's African Union summit warned that the world was "" running out of patience on Darfur "" , Sudan 's government continues to hamper the new peacekeeping mission 's deployment , and last week launched the heaviest aerial attacks on villages in Darfur for more than a year . ""
Sudan does listen and will continue to listen to what China says , "" said Sally Chin , Sudan analyst for the International Crisis Group .
"" There is so much more that it could be doing to put pressure on Khartoum to allow in the peacekeepers into Darfur , and to respect the ceasefire . ""
Egbert Wesselink , head of the European Coalition on Oil in Sudan , a research group , said China 's "" positive "" influence did not appear to have had any real effect .
"" It may be that it is giving a lot of good and wise advice to Sudan in private , but I have yet to see any tangible results in Darfur .
So is this ' new Chinese policy ' meaningful ?
I would have to say not . ""
The relationship stretches back to 1994 , when Khartoum 's role in sponsoring terror and waging civil war in the south of the country severely limited its options for developing its petroleum industry .
Eager to crack the western - dominated oil market , China dived in , helping Sudan become an oil exporter within five years by building a 1,000-mile pipeline and a refinery in the capital .
Along the way , the state - owned Chinese National Petroleum Company took 40 % stakes in Sudan 's two main oil consortiums .
For China this proved extremely profitable as oil prices soared ; in Sudan , human rights groups say , it helped fuel wars .
The Swiss - based Small Arms Survey says that up to 80 % of Sudan 's share of its early oil revenues was spent on weapons for the war in the south - with the close assistance of China , which had previously sold it fighter jets and military helicopters .
By the beginning of the separate Darfur conflict in 2003 , China had overtaken Iran as the country 's main arms supplier and helped build weapons factories in Sudan .
For Khartoum , which has also benefited from soft loans and Chinese expertise in building dams , bridges and rail networks , the partnership had another crucial upside .
As the war in Darfur attracted increasing international condemnation , China used its permanent seat on the UN Security Council to consistently stop strong action being taken against Sudan ."
2008-03-20,"The Dalai Lama has said he is willing to meet Chinese leaders but will wait for concrete signs that the situation in Tibet is "" becoming more positive "" .
Speaking at a press conference , Tibet 's spiritual leader said he was "" always ready to meet Chinese leaders , particularly Hu Jintao "" – China 's president , who in 1989 oversaw a bloody crackdown in Lhasa as the regional Communist party secretary .
Given the unrest in Tibet , the Dalai Lama said , he was unlikely to make an immediate trip to Beijing . ""
Going to Peking ( Beijing ) would be big news .
Then many Tibetans would develop unrealistic expectations .
I have to think about that very carefully . ""
The 73-year - old said he would wait until "" after this crisis "" for concrete changes in Tibet . ""
In the next few weeks and months I will see if there is something becoming more positive . ""
He was responding to a statement by the British prime minister , Gordon Brown , that the Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , was willing to meet the Dalai Lama if the exiled leader agreed he did not support the total independence of Tibet and renounced violence .
The Dalai Lama said these two conditions had been met years ago .
The two sides broke off talks last summer .
The Dalai Lama said he was concerned to hear that protests had spread outside Tibet .
The state - run Xinhua news agency has reported unrest in Sichuan and Gansu provinces , and thousands of armed police have been sent there , as well as to neighbouring Qinghai province , where there have been sporadic demonstrations .
The Dalai Lama said he was increasingly concerned about the plight of remote villagers who could bear the brunt of Chinese reprisals .
"" I am really worried a lot of casualties may happen .
There are no medical facilities .
These are helpless unarmed innocent people who simply love Tibetan culture . """
2008-03-23,"One image above all from the Tibetan crisis will have stunned President Hu Jintao and his colleagues in Beijing .
It is that of dozens of young men on horseback , whooping wildly as they ride round Bora monastery in Gansu province , urging fellow Tibetans to storm a government building , demand freedom and hoist their own flag .
And in Dharamsala , the Indian capital of the Tibetan exile government , the pictures of serious rioting in Lhasa , with cars being overturned and Chinese passers - by viciously attacked , have shaken the Dalai Lama and the advocates of non - violence .
Those who have followed the story of Tibet 's long struggle against decades of Beijing 's brutal and short - sighted rule are amazed at the outpouring of anger now seen not only in the Tibet Autonomous Region ( TAR ) , but also in the ethnic Tibetan areas - such as Bora - of neighbouring western provinces of China , to which troop reinforcements are being rushed .
For young Tibetan exiles who mourn what they call the theft of their country by China , the sight is exhilarating , if perturbing . ""
In one way , we are all just feeling so proud and so happy and so inspired to see our people stand up , "" says the Tibetan youth leader , Lhadon Tethong , "" but at the same time , we have such a sense of dread .
We know the Chinese can do what they want . ""
While the Beijing media dwells on the deaths of Chinese civilians in Lhasa , pro - Tibet groups abroad circulate horrifying images of Tibetan protestors shot dead in Ngaba County in Sichuan .
This violent escalation has moved out of the control of the two main players - the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government - but their reactions have been typically different .
The Dalai Lama has repeated his willingness to talk , if necessary with President Hu , and has repeated , too , his intention to resign as leader of the Tibetan government in exile if his political role becomes redundant .
This week , in India , he met leaders of the five radical exile groups who are staging a march destined , in theory , to reach Lhasa with the proclaimed aim of inspiring "" another uprising to shake China 's control in Tibet "" .
So far , the Dalai Lama has failed to dissuade them from continuing with the march or from calling for a boycott of the Olympics .
March coordinator Sherab Woeser says the Olympics "" allows us to present our cause in the international arena , and to supply a rallying point for Tibetans .
"" China , meanwhile , has ratcheted up the rhetoric , refusing to talk with the "" wolf in monk 's clothing "" , and has accused him of instigating the protests while refusing to produce any evidence .
And , after an initial show of restraint , which may have simply reflected uncertainty , the Chinese authorities have cracked down with the kind of force and language in the style of 1989 , the year of Tiananmen Square , when Lhasa was under martial law for even longer than Beijing .
The Tibet party boss Zhang Qingli calls it "" an intensely bloody and fierce struggle ... with the enemy "" , and severe punishment is being threatened against the rioters - who had been promised leniency if they surrendered .
Just one day before the protests started in Lhasa , Zhang 's deputy , Ragdi , triumphantly told China 's parliament in Beijing that Tibet now enjoyed "" social stability "" and all the alleged "" conspiracies by the Dalai Lama clique "" had been foiled .
In China 's own terms , these high officials have failed disastrously , yet none of them would dream of resigning .
Ragdi first gained power through opportunistic support for the cultural revolution ( 1966 - 76 ) , which devastated Tibet , and he has clung to his position ever since .
On the Tibetan exiles ' side , most of the younger generation believe that the Dalai Lama 's policy of low - key diplomacy has failed .
It is now 20 years since he first assured the Chinese that he sought not full independence , but genuine autonomy for Tibet ; and yet , in spite of desultory negotiations , Beijing still denies his good faith .
Tsering Tashi , the Dalai Lama 's representative in London , acknowledges that "" the Tibetan people have been protesting for many years , but no one took notice , so a deep - rooted resentment has built up "" .
Yet , it is too simple to see His Holiness and the Tibetan youth as in opposing camps .
Not only does he command huge respect as their spiritual leader , but there is also an awareness that they are playing different roles .
The goal of their activities , says the Tibetan Women 's Association president , B Tsering , is "" to push China to enter a dialogue with His Holiness "" ; and she politely "" begs to differ "" on whether or not to call for an Olympic boycott .
"" We understand His Holiness 's situation , "" explains Tethong . ""
He is both a spiritual and political leader ; and most people feel he is working to find a solution in the best way that he can . ""
With hindsight , it probably made little difference whether the Dalai Lama limited his demands to autonomy or not : the real miscalculation , as events now show , lies on the Chinese side , where no concessions have ever been offered .
Beijing 's hope that the Tibetan problem would be eroded by economic growth , just as the political unrest after Tiananmen Square was diverted by China 's market reforms , now seems a spectacular misjudgement .
The arrival of the new railway in Lhasa has only widened the gap between those who enjoy a better standard of living - mostly businesses and government officials ( Tibetan as well as Chinese ) - and a resentful Tibetan underclass .
The flag - hoisting episodes by Tibetan communities in China 's own provinces shows that a sense of nationhood has grown , rather than shrunk .
"" I see many letters from inside Tibet , "" says Woeser .
"" I have n't seen anyone asking just for autonomy or for the Chinese to be more lenient . ""
A banner carried by Tibetan students at the Lanzhou Minorities Institute in Gansu - 30 hours away on the railway - carries the significant slogan that "" we ( the Tibetan people ) should share the happiness and suffering together . ""
Lhasa - born journalist Tseten Wangchuk believes that Tibetans in these outer areas have been energised by better conditions of life .
"" They are much more mobile , they have telephones and internet , and a greater sense of national identity . ""
A few emails or text messages would have been enough to spur Tibetans in Gansu , Qinghai and Sichuan provinces to take their cue from Lhasa .
The Dalai Lama 's policy of conciliation may have failed , but this spread of opposition justifies his insistence that the "" genuine autonomy "" which he is seeking should apply to all the Tibetan peoples , not just those in the TAR .
China 's own statistics , which count all Tibetans as a single ethnic group , show that out of a total population of 5.4 million almost half ( 2.64 million ) live in the provinces outside official Tibet .
If the unrest spreads , Beijing 's Tibetan problem will be doubled .
The Dalai Lama himself was born far from Lhasa in Qinghai province : access to his native village of Taktser has now been sealed off .
He has speculated on whether an eventual successor will be re - incarnated outside Tibet , or chosen by referendum , or even whether he will be the last in the line .
What now seems certain is that the Tibetan struggle will not go away ."
2008-04-13,"Beijing and Taipei face a "" historical opportunity "" for closer economic cooperation , the Chinese president Hu Jintao has said after breaking 60 years of icy relations by meeting Taiwan 's vice - president elect this weekend .
The brief , mostly private , meeting with Vincent Siew is believed to be the highest - level contact between the two sides since 1949 , when Taiwan broke away at the end of the civil war .
China has always maintained that the island remains part of its territory .
The new Taiwanese government , which takes power next month , was elected on a platform of improving economic ties to China as well as because of the unpopularity of the outgoing president , Chen Shui - bian .
Hu and Siew met for 20 minutes on the sidelines of the Boao forum for Asia in Hainan , southern China .
The state news agency said Hu had endorsed proposals to allow direct weekend charter flights and open Taiwan to more Chinese tourists .
Siew followed up the talks by meeting China 's commerce minister Chen Deming yesterday .
Chen said normalising trade and economic ties was urgent , adding : "" By working together , we can reduce the negative impact on us from the slowing of growth in western countries . """
2008-04-17,"Ping - pong diplomacy is back .
Reuters reports that Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukada is shaping up to take on President Hu Jintao of China at table tennis when he arrives in Tokyo next month , the first such visit by a Chinese president for a decade , and the first such game since Fukuda 's away fixture with the Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , last year .
The prospect sounds so bland and harmless .
Surely a little ball like that could n't hurt grown men ?
Do n't you believe it .
There is little in sport more vicious than a game of croquet .
An All Blacks scrum is merely physical ; croquet leaves scars that do not heal .
Ping - pong can be almost as bad .
Why do they put such burdens on the tiny ball ?
Nicholas Sarkozy does not challenge Angela Merkel to a game of squash , weightlifting or mud - wrestling .
The Pope has not brought his ivory tiddlywinks set to Washington .
It must be because ping - pong got off to a good diplomatic start .
Invented in 19th - century England ( like most world - conquering games ) , it enabled Americans to set foot in Beijing for the first time after China was "" lost "" to communism in 1949 .
In 1971 , there were a series of informal exchanges between top US and Chinese players at the 31st World Table Tennis Championship in Tokyo .
The most famous of these was the offer of a lift on the Chinese team bus , made by ex - world champion Zhuang Zedong to the US player Glenn Cowan .
A
Let It Be T - shirt and a silk - screen mountain scene were exchanged .
An invitation to play exhibition matches , tour the Great Wall and watch ballet followed .
Ten months later , President Nixon paid his visit to China , a diplomatic turning point that helped make China the emerging superpower it is today .
Not all such events work so well .
During Gordon Brown 's last visit to Beijing in January , Wen challenged him to a game .
Brown , perhaps conscious of his one not - very - good eye , declined .
You need n't have worried , Gordon - Reuters never reports who won ."
2008-05-06,"East Asia 's biggest rivals were today preparing to welcome a "" warm spring "" to replace the bitter winter chill that has long cut through their relationship , as Hu Jintao arrived in Tokyo on the first visit to Japan by a Chinese president for a decade .
Though his arrival was greeted by an unlikely alliance of pro - Tibetan activists and members of the Japanese far - right , the demonstrators are unlikely to overshadow what is being billed as a symbolic turning point in Sino - Japanese ties after years of barely concealed hostility .
The Chinese leader , who is making his longest overseas visit since becoming president in 2003 , struck a conciliatory note soon after arriving at Haneda airport in Tokyo amid tight security .
"" Japan and China are both important countries in Asia and the world , "" he said in a statement . ""
[ This visit ] will enhance friendship and cooperation in both countries . ""
Over the next five days Hu will meet the Japanese prime minister , Yasuo Fukuda , and dine with the emperor and empress , whom he is expected to invite to the opening ceremony of the Olympic games .
He will address students at Waseda University in Tokyo , visit historic temples and , if time allows , take on Fukuda at table tennis in echoes of the ping - pong diplomacy that led to a thaw in ties between China and the US in the early 1970s .
Nature has determined that the leaders will also try to find a solution to Japan 's pressing panda problem .
The death last month of Ling Ling , a gift from China in 1992 , has presented Hu with the opportunity to further endear himself to his hosts if , as many expect , he agrees to provide a replacement for the popular resident of Ueno zoo in Tokyo .
In the past Chinese leaders used Japan 's lack of contrition over its wartime conduct as an excuse to cut off top - level contacts , a diplomatic freeze that lasted several years until Shinzo Abe visited Beijing days after becoming prime minister in the autumn of 2006 .
This week , however , Hu likened the atmosphere surrounding his visit to a "" warm spring "" .
"" I sincerely hope for generations of friendship between the people of China and Japan , "" he wrote in a message to a Japanese - language magazine .
The countries ' economic ties , he said , had "" brought real benefits to the people of both countries and spurred the growth and development of each "" .
Last year China replaced the US as Japan 's biggest trading partner , with two - way trade worth $ 236.6bn ( £ 118bn ) .
Japanese foreign direct investment in China totaled $ 6.2bn .
The optimism is partly fuelled by an agreement to avoid detailed discussion of controversial issues .
Officials hinted that their joint communique would avoid mention of Japan 's wartime record .
References to other sensitive subjects , such as human rights , Taiwan and Tokyo 's bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council , are still being negotiated , they said .
But little progress is expected on competing claims on natural gas deposits beneath the East China Sea or Japanese demands for greater transparency over China 's military spending , said to be $ 60bn this year .
Hu 's visit comes days after a newspaper poll found that a majority of Japanese supported a tougher line against China in light of its crackdown in Tibet , its military build - up and fears about the safety of its food exports .
Chinese food exports to Japan were hit earlier this year after the discovery of pesticide in shipments of frozen dumplings .
Despite underlying frictions , few expect a repeat of Jiang Zemin 's visit in 1998 , when the then president lectured his hosts on their wartime record and , in front of the emperor , demanded that Japan apologise in writing for its 1931 - 1945 occupation of China .
Hu , by contrast , is expected to seek support for the Olympics from Japan , whose criticism of the suppression of protests in Tibet was muted even before Beijing agreed to meet representatives of the Dalai Lama last weekend .
While Fukuda described Tibet as an "" international problem "" he is thought unlikely to embarrass his guest with overt public criticism of China 's human rights record .
The leaders are also expected to support a commitment to halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , just weeks before the leader of the G8 group of rich nations meet in northern Japan .
Hu 's visit is the clearest sign yet of a thaw in relations that began with the departure of Junichiro Koizumi as Japan 's prime minister in 2006 .
A year earlier , Koizumi 's repeated visits to Yasukuni , a nationalist shrine devoted to Japan 's war dead , and his government 's approval of revisionist history textbooks , culminated in anti - Japanese protests in several Chinese cities .
Fukuda , regarded as the most pro - China Japanese leader for years , has pointedly refused to visit the shrine , which also honours more than a dozen class - A war criminals .
Andrew Horvat , a professor at Tokyo Keizai University , said the two countries "" have gone through a very difficult 10 years and have realised that abusing history for short - term diplomatic and political gains has its costs .
I think they have learned that . ""
For now , many Japanese will be satisfied with a deal on a replacement for Ling Ling , whose death aged 22 was a cause for national mourning .
"" It would be nice if we had a panda there again , "" Fukuda said ahead of Hu 's visit ."
2008-05-07,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , today accused the Dalai Lama of attempting to ruin the Beijing Olympics and challenged him to "" show sincerity "" in opposing violent resistance to Chinese rule in Tibet .
Hu , who is in Japan on a five - day visit , told reporters that last weekend 's talks between Chinese officials and representatives of Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader had been "" conscientious and serious . ""
But he added : "" We hope the Dalai will show his sincerity through his actions .
We hope [ he ] will stop acting to separate the homeland , stop orchestrating the incitement of violent acts and stop undermining the Beijing Olympics , and so create the conditions for further discussions . ""
In the first sign of tension between Hu and his host , the Japanese prime minister , Yasuo Fukuda appeared to contradict Beijing 's insistence that the violent suppression of protests in Tibet in March was a strictly domestic concern and should not affect the Olympic preparations . ""
The Olympics must succeed , "" he said after talks with Hu in the morning .
"" The world is watching .
We hope the Chinese people realise this and that people will be able to enjoy watching the games . ""
Fukuda , who has yet to say if he will attend the opening ceremony on August 8 , said the decision to award the games to Beijing could burnish China 's image overseas , as it had Japan 's when it hosted the Olympics in 1964 .
He welcomed Sunday 's talks between the two sides in Shenzen .
"" I rate highly the president 's decision to enter into a dialogue [ with the Dalai Lama ] and the fact that the talks were held .
"" I have high expectations that the dialogue will be held patiently and ... for the situation to improve and the international community 's concerns to be dispelled . ""
Hu 's visit , the first to Japan by a Chinese president for 10 years , began with a goodwill gesture over dinner last night when he agreed to lend Japan two giant pandas to replace Ling Ling , a gift from China in 1992 , who died at Ueno zoo in Tokyo last week .
Today , however , discussions returned to the countries ' competing claims over natural gas fields stretching across their maritime boundary in the East China Sea .
China has already begun drilling in the gas fields - thought to contain up to 364bn cubic feet of natural gas and 18 m barrels of oil - but Japan has repeatedly called for joint explorations .
Though high - level talks failed to achieve a breakthrough before Hu 's arrival in Tokyo , he said the prospects for settling the dispute "" are already in view , and I am happy about that "" .
Hu also paid tribute to the countries ' growing economic ties - two - way trade was worth a record $ 237bn ( £ 118bn ) last year - at a meeting with business leaders .
He was due to visit Yokohama , a port city with a large Chinese community , before heading to Nara to tour the ancient capital 's historic sites .
The leaders are hoping to play what is expected to be a genteel game of table tennis .
In a sign of the recent improvement in ties between the former enemies , Hu and Fukuda said in a joint statement : "" The relationship between China and Japan is of utmost importance to both countries .
We agree we must cooperate towards long - term peace and friendship . ""
As expected , the document barely mentioned their countries ' troubled history , committing them to "" look squarely at history and turn towards the future "" .
China stopped short of supporting Tokyo 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the UN security council , however , saying only that it hoped to see Japan play a "" bigger and more constructive "" international role ."

He will address students at Waseda University in Tokyo , visit historic temples and , if time allows , take on Fukuda at table tennis in echoes of the ping - pong diplomacy that led to a thaw in ties between China and the US in the early 1970s .
The leaders will also try to find a solution to Japan 's panda problem .
The death last month of Ling Ling , a gift from China in 1992 , has presented Hu with the opportunity to further endear himself to his hosts if , as many expect , he agrees to provide a replacement panda .
Hu likened the atmosphere of his visit to a "" warm spring "" .
The countries ' economic ties , he said , had "" brought real benefits to the people of both countries "" .
Last year , China replaced the US as Japan 's biggest trading partner , with two - way trade worth $ 236.6bn ( £ 118bn ) .
Both sides have agreed to avoid discussing controversial issues such as Japan 's wartime record , China 's conduct on human rights , Taiwan , and Tokyo 's bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council .
Hu is expected to seek support for the Olympics from Japan .
While Fukuda described Tibet as an "" international problem "" he is thought unlikely to embarrass his guest with overt public criticism of China 's human rights record ."
2008-05-08,"Hu Jintao , the Chinese president will make a high - profile visit to Japan from May 6 - 10 , making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there .
The trip is being carefully managed by both countries , and is being watched closely around the world , with good reason : Sino - Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent , to say the least .
When Hu 's predecessor , Jiang Zemin , travelled to Japan 10 years ago , bilateral relations were deteriorating : China was unhappy with the Japanese government 's refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression ; Japan was worried about a rising China and thus becoming more confrontational .
The Japanese media 's coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative , and it was remembered as a public relations disaster .
Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002 , almost as former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan , and encouraged "" New Thinking "" in China 's Japan policy .
This entailed moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties .
But , instead of accepting China 's olive branch , Koizumi implemented a more nationalistic agenda , including annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine , which is regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism by Japan 's neighbours .
His hardline approach isolated Japan and angered China , leading to an outburst of anti - Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005 .
But both Japan and China recognise that further tension will serve neither country 's long - term interests .
Koizumi 's successors , Prime ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda , have sought to engage China over the past two years , with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , to Japan last year .
Hu 's trip is likely follow the example set by Wen .
He will emphasise common strategic interests , highlight mutual economic benefits , generate positive public opinion , and promote further exchanges .
Japan is not only one of China 's largest trade and investment partners , it is also the most powerful neighbour with which China wants to be on good terms , partly to showcase that China 's rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world .
Japan , whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years , is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity , as least in economic terms .
It was 30 years ago that former prime minister , Takeo Fukuda , the father of today 's prime minister , signed a peace and friendship treaty with China .
The two governments will certainly use Hu 's visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programmes designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship .
But , unlike three decades ago , when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favoured countries , public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones .
Behind the smiles , the polite interactions , and the cautiously worded diplomatic language , strong undercurrents of suspicion remain .
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea .
Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection , areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialised countries , the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters , which contain huge potential oil , gas , and other mineral deposits .
Even after many rounds of talks , no resolution is in sight , and Hu 's visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs .
Then there are strategic suspicions .
Fukuda has dropped Abe 's talk about an "" arch of freedom "" - an effort to forge a bloc with the US , Australia , and India .
But Japan remains concerned about China 's rapidly modernising military , while China worries about a potential US - Japan containment strategy for China , especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits .
So , although both sides endorse the idea of a "" mutually beneficial strategic relationship , "" and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges , mutual trust and confidence - building have a long way to go .
Moreover , today 's "" warm politics , cool economics "" trend is the reverse of the "" cold politics , warm economics "" pattern under Koizumi .
Last year , Japan 's committed investment projects in China fell 24 % from 2006 , while actual investment volume decreased by 25 % , partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment .
Recent food safety issues , such as the "" poisoned dumplings "" cases , have clearly heightened the Japanese public 's sensitivity about Chinese exports .
Finally , historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems .
While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni shrine , 160 other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month , an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni .
And Japan has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between 700,000 and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in China by the Japanese army at the end of the second world war , another potential flashpoint if any of these weapons causes casualties in China .

2008-05-18,"The motorcade swept down the mountain from the stricken town of Beichuan .
Behind a darkened window was China 's President , speeding past the flattened houses , rock falls and waiting survivors .
Later that day state television 's wall - to - wall earthquake coverage would show Hu Jintao reassuring the injured and spurring rescuers on to greater efforts .
But those who sat at the roadside in the baking Sichuan heat barely registered the startling presence of their leader on this devastated soil .
Nor did they register the unprecedented show of emotion from cabinet spokesman Guo Weimin , who had to stop to compose himself as he read from an updated casualty report which put the death toll so far at 28,881 .
Five days after the 7.9-magnitude quake hit the south - western province , destroying millions of homes and tens of thousands of lives , as their government 's humane reaction to this disaster is changing perceptions of the communist regime around the world , these farmers thought only of those they loved and of survival .
One woman had walked for three days with her baby and young daughter to reach this spot .
All were hungry and dazed .
Beads of sweat gathered on their foreheads as they waited for a ride .
A chicken poked its head through the hole in a sack and squawked irritably , but its owner had salvaged nothing else and had no intention of leaving it behind .
A truck pulled up and the exhausted farmers hoisted themselves over the sides , cramming their meagre possessions in around them .
Clinging to the sides , they rattled down the steep road .
Doorways poked out of the hillside where the houses around them had disintegrated .
Giant rocks littered the road and vehicles lay in ditches , thrown off the road by the force of the shock .
Somewhere ahead lay safety . '
The feeling of the earthquake was like this lorry , ' said one of the farmers , as the vehicle jolted and shook its way across the countryside .
He was companionable and chatty , though he did n't want to give his real name ; we called him Mr Wu .
At 2.28pm last Monday , Wu was tending his cornfield . '
It was like a bomb exploding out of the ground , ' he said . '
Everything shook .
Our house collapsed and then the whole mountain .
The sky was dark , the way it goes before rain .
No one could stand .
The telegraph poles fell and the land slipped into cracks .
My wife and daughter were fine , but a lot of our neighbours died . '
Landslides on the road into town and between the centre and the main road , had blocked all hope of rescue .
The heavy rains that followed prevented helicopter drops .
Like thousands across this vast swath of Sichuan , Wu and his neighbours had to help themselves . '
Those who were alive helped those who were trapped and injured .
Even on the third day we got someone out alive .
Now I have time to look for my son , ' he said . '
He was at Beichuan middle school and we ca n't get in touch with him . '
Wu had risen early that morning and walked for 10 hours over the mountain to find a lift , stopping first at the school . '
People there told me a lot of kids were taken straight to the Mianyang refugee camp , so I 'm going there to see if I can find him , ' he said , sounding resolute but calm .
His mood could have been either optimism or denial : he must have known that hundreds of pupils - two - thirds of the roll - had died at that school .
As the lorry rattled its way to Mianyang , Wu spoke about his son , 16-year - old Ming , a book - loving boy who hoped to become a lawyer . '
You could n't really call him talkative , ' he said , showing his son 's ID card .
Despite the dangers of Beichuan , still at risk from aftershocks , landslides and flooding , many locals were only leaving the area to search for other family members elsewhere .
Some fear that the destruction wrought in Beichuan - and the sheer number of corpses in the rubble - will turn it into a ghost town .
But Wu insisted he would return once the road was unblocked . '
We have no money to rebuild the house , but we can live in tents , ' he said . '
At least my crops are OK . '
He shook his head and smiled when asked if he was afraid . '
I have buried so many dead bodies , I do not feel frightened any more , ' he said .
Two men leant over the side of the moving truck , sharing a cigarette as they watched the countryside speed past .
Other passengers , too tired or traumatised to speak , huddled in the corners , heads down .
Each time the driver braked , the travellers lurched against each other and quacks of protest rose from ducks jammed in among cloth bundles .
At Mianyang , the truck emptied quickly , its passengers keen to begin their search for loved ones , pausing only to help the others down .
Outside the main refugee camp , thousands of homeless families lay beneath tarpaulins or milled aimlessly on the grass .
Wu dashed from one group to another , seeking news of the middle school .
A young woman directed him to a centre seven kilometres away .
Taxis ferrying survivors there without charge were crammed .
A private car pulled over and the men inside urged Wu to get in .
There were 60,000 refugees in Mianyang city - itself hit hard by the quake - they told him .
On a street corner a giant screen flashed the latest rescue update .
Wu grew quieter .
Changhong , a major local employer , had taken charge of the middle school pupils , handling matters with corporate efficiency .
A dozen pieces of A4 paper , stuck to the marble wall of its restaurant , bore the names of those who had escaped the shock .
Wu scanned them methodically : his son 's name was not there .
Only two of his classmates were listed . '
I 'm mentally prepared , '
Wu told a Changhong volunteer as they walked across the compound to find the pupils . '
It 's a natural disaster . '
The man slipped an arm around Wu 's shoulder .
Hundreds of teenagers were bedded down in the firm 's sports centre , waiting for someone to claim them .
Outside , anxious parents sought news of their children .
The two survivors from Ming 's class had vanished , but Wu settled down to wait for other pupils . '
I want to see if I can find my neighbour 's kid .
They heard she was OK , but her name is not on the list .
Even if I ca n't find her here , maybe I can ask the other children for any information about her or my boy , ' he said .
Then he murmured : ' I do n't want to think there 's no hope . '
The company had provided sleeping bags , clean clothes , food and phones .
Two televisions , intended to provide distraction , showed vivid images of rock slides , buildings torn sideways and mounds of debris .
Many of their fathers and mothers lay somewhere in the town .
Seventeen - year - old Long Xiang was subdued ; she had traced an aunt , but nothing was known of her parents .
She had been on the top floor when the quake hit .
All her classmates survived , jumping out of their shattered room over the remains of the building .
She was not sure how Wu 's son , Ming , would have fared . '
Class 10 was on the fourth floor too , but they were in the older building and we were in the new one , ' she said .
Children were still being pulled free days later .
Another pupil , 16-year - old Zheng Youquan , stressed the good fortune of his form : only 10 of 65 classmates were dead . '
It started to shake and right away I hid under my desk .
Then the floor just gave way .
We were trapped and did n't know what was happening , ' he said . '
Because I was hidden , I was not injured , but after a long time I realised the girl who shared my desk was dead .
I touched her leg , the only part of her body I could reach , to feel her temperature .
Some of my classmates were injured and I shouted to them to be calm and not fall asleep .
People closer to the hole asked us to be quiet so they could cry for help .
Then another class came to rescue us . '
Many survivors , like Zheng , seem too shocked to understand what has befallen them . '
I did n't really feel frightened .
I do n't know if I have already become numb , ' he said . '
Standing here , I feel there are tremors .
I do n't know if it 's paranoia or not .
The scene of my classmates will always be in my mind .
It keeps coming back to me .
I do n't think of anything else . '
As he left for dinner , he urged us : ' Please , be careful , you must watch out for landslides . '
The scale of this catastrophe is hard to contemplate .
Although China 's swift response has been praised , the determination of some 150,000 troops and paramilitary police seems puny set against the might of the quake .
Almost five million people are homeless ; 190,000 injured ; probably 50,000 have died .
There are thousands of orphans and newly childless couples .
Attention is already turning to the daunting challenge of rebuilding shattered areas and housing 4.8 million homeless survivors .
Some have begun to return to their homes , despite the continuing tremors , fearing they have nowhere else to go .
The government has pledged a probe into whether shoddy construction linked to corruption was responsible for the collapse of almost 7,000 school buildings , amid anger from parents .
The government 's unusual openness has been matched by an extraordinary outpouring of public generosity .
The overwhelming mood has been one of unity in the face of the challenge , with the government appealing to the public for support and a massive voluntary drive to rescue , feed and shelter survivors .
Across the province , firefighters have worked around the clock .
Volunteers have risked their lives to rescue trapped victims .
The bereaved have helped to reunite families ; the hungry and homeless have refused food and water in case
others needed it more .
Sichuan saw disaster last week , and a wrenching pain that will scar the community for the decades to come .
It also saw patience , dignity , courage and love .

2008-05-20,"Before everyone gets all dewy - eyed about the Chinese authorities because they mounted a rescue operation for their citizens who suffered injury and were made homeless by the earthquake ( as , surely , most countries outside Burma would have done ) , here 's a reminder of what it 's like to go against the grain in China .
The World Association of Newspapers and World Editors Forum have just delivered a strong protest letter to China 's president , Hu Jintao , because of last week 's jailing of two journalists and the continued crackdown on freedom of expression ahead of the Beijing Olympics .
It calls for the immediate release of Qi Chonghuai and He Yanjie , who had the temerity to report that an official had beaten a woman for arriving late for work .
The reporters also posted pictures of a luxurious Tengzhou government building on an official anti - corruption website .
Mr Qi , who works for China Legal News in Shandong province , was sentenced to four years in prison and
Mr He , a freelancer , received a two - year sentence .
Their trial , on charges of fraud an extortion , was closed to the press .
The charges are routinely used by Chinese authorities to silence critical journalists .
China remains the world 's biggest jailer of journalists , despite its promise , made in its successful Olympic bid , to respect press freedom .
At least 30 journalists and 50 cyber - dissidents are in Chinese prisons .
WAN , the global organisation for the newspaper industry that represents 18,000 newspapers , has also called on the International Olympic Committee to hold China to its promises .
It has urged everyone going to the Olympics - athletes , sponsors and members of the media - to "" exert serious pressure on the Chinese authorities to cease their flagrant and persistent abuses of human rights "" and to release all jailed journalists .
You can read more about WAN 's worthy campaign here on its website ."
2008-05-31,"Angry Chinese internet users have launched an online campaign against an official in the earthquake zone who is accused of grinning too much in the midst of the disaster .
Censors have moved slowly to silence the unusually critical debate on blogs and community bulletin boards about Tan Li , the Communist Party chief of Mianyang , and what many see as his inappropriate smile .
Websites show four pictures of Li , apparently beaming , as he escorts President Hu Jintao around his town and conducts other duties .
As well as being disrespectful , critics say the local party boss was negligent in his slow response to the disaster .
Search engines suggest the three main posts about this topic on Tianya , one of the most popular internet community sites in China , have been read by more than 10,000 viewers .
Many entries have been deleted by the censors , but others can still be read despite their incendiary content . '
Tan Li did not report the situation in Beichuan county to the central government in time , so they did not know it was so badly hit .
This delayed the rescue operation in Beichuan , ' said one post .
Another accused Tan of stealing relief funds : ' Let me tell you why he smiled .
He is always corrupt and he knows [ this disaster ] will provide another opportunity . '
Refugees in Mianyang are texting each other with a short message that changes a popular song to attack Tan . '
Ca n't forget your corruption , ca n't forget your smile .
After 512 [ 12 May ] , when people are still suffering , you act like you 've already seen the donation money and ca n't help laughing , ' the opening lines read .
No evidence is provided for the accusations , the facial expressions might have been taken out of context and the critics all write under pseudonyms , but the debate highlights the unusual openness of the media and the rawness of public emotions in the wake of the disaster .
The outpouring of sympathy for the victims and national pride in the relief work have been mixed with anger at the shoddy construction of schools and any sign of disrespectful behaviour by public figures .
In the past this debate would have been quickly stifled by censors , but domestic reporters have pushed at the boundaries of what is permissible and the authorities have eased back on controls .
The debate about Tan remains small by the standards of China , which has the world 's biggest online population .
The media 's main focus is on the evacuation of almost 200,000 people downstream of a mountain lake formed by the earthquake that threatens to burst its banks .
Authorities said yesterday that engineers and soldiers have completed a channel to drain the Tangjiashan ' quake lake ' .
If the project fails , they have a contingency plan to move 1.3 million people to higher ground ."
2008-06-16,"Japan and China are on the verge of ending a long - running battle over potentially lucrative energy sources in the East China Sea with an agreement to jointly develop gas fields along their disputed maritime border .
The deal , which has yet to be confirmed , comes soon after the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , and the Japanese prime minister , Yasuo Fukuda , vowed to end the dispute during a summit in Tokyo last month .
Japan says it has identified the equivalent of 92 m barrels of oil in the area , but both countries agree that further exploration could reveal much bigger quantities .
Negotiations started after China unilaterally began explorations in the area in 2004 amid accusations that it would also tap into deposits on the Japanese side of the disputed border .
Although demarcation of their overlapping maritime territory has yet to be settled , the two sides agreed to give private firms the go - ahead to start drilling and to take profits commensurate with their respective investments , the Kyodo news agency reported .
An official announcement is expected later this week , it said ."
2008-06-20,"In the 1930s , US president Franklin Roosevelt 's fireside chats set the political tone of the radio age .
In the 1960s , John Kennedy 's impassioned speeches thrilled the first television generation .
Yesterday the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , made his mark with a four - minute online debut in front of the world 's biggest population of internet users .
Without tapping a keyboard , the Communist leader dictated his responses to an online forum of the People 's Daily , the mouthpiece of the ruling party .
Online video shows the president , who is widely seen as stiff and distant , visiting the newsroom to answer queries on the paper 's website .
According to China Digital Times - a US - based website that monitors the internet in China - Hu scanned a page of questions that included topics such as Taiwan 's democracy , inflation and officials wasting money on lavish banquets .
Some readers reportedly addressed the president as Boss Hu , Old Hu and Brother Hu , familiarity common on the internet but sharply at odds with protocol .
But the forum host changed the title to General Secretary Hu as she read out an uncontentious question about how often the president uses the internet . ""
Although I am very busy and I do not have the time to use the internet everyday , I try to spare some time to do it .
I want to say that this online forum of People.com is one of the websites I visit often , "" Hu replied into a microphone .
Asked next about his online reading habits , the president said he first followed domestic and foreign news , then looked for internet users ' comments about the work of the party and the country .
Although ballot - box democracy is practised only at a local level in China , the leaders of the one - party state have shown themselves to be responsive at times to online opinion .
China 's net population is estimated at 221 million , after overtaking the US earlier this year .
The last question asked whether Hu could see chatroom suggestions .
"" We care a lot about internet users ' ideas and advice , "" said the president .
Responses to the online chat were positive .
"" It is good to be able to communicate with top leaders .
I hope it is not the only time we get a chance , "" said one post .

2008-08-04,"The International Olympic Committee announced its arrival in Beijing last night with a typically portentous flourish .
At a lavish ceremony at the new opera house , attended by the Chinese premier Hu Jintao and featuring the National Symphony Orchestra of China and some of the world 's great operatic singers , the IOC 's annual session was officially declared open .
It is perhaps the only body on earth that would commission a world - class concert to mark the start of what is effectively its AGM , but then this is no ordinary session .
Behind the pomp and the protocol the IOC is facing the most telling three weeks in its modern history , as the world prepares to reach a verdict on Beijing 's Games and the Olympic movement 's judgment in awarding them to China in the first place .
The credibility of the IOC is on trial just as much as that of Beijing and the mutual interest in delivering a successful and credible Games was evident last night .
In speeches cloaked in diplomacy and euphemism , Hu Jintao and the IOC president , Jacques Rogge , repeated their mutual mantra that the Olympics are a force for good in China .
Having come so far together , the IOC and the Chinese Communist Party are not about to abandon each other now .
In an address that predictably referred in only the vaguest terms to the human rights concerns that have dogged Beijing 's preparations , Rogge acknowledged that the world was watching and tried to justify his faith in China 's "" historic "" Games .
"" I said at the outset that these Games would be historic .
They are already a landmark .
The mere fact that they are coming to China , home to nearly 20 % of the world 's population , is significant , "" he said .
"" I am equally confident that the Games will leave a great legacy for China .
China is a nation in transition with a great future , tremendous potential and some challenges .
I believe history will view the 2008 Olympics as a significant milestone in China 's remarkable transformation . ""
The Olympic movement should constantly seek to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries by promoting sport and our Olympic values .
The Olympic rings are a powerful symbol , recognised worldwide , because they represent a set of universal values . ""
The risk associated with awarding the Games to China was never technical , a fact acknowledged obliquely by Hu Jintao in his address to the session .
"" It is our hope that through the Games we can show the world the sincere aspiration of the Chinese people to share in the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future , "" he said .
He did not point out that one - party states have an advantage over functioning democracies when it comes to shifting earth and renewing infrastructure , but he did not need to .
It is clear that these Games will work .
New highways fan out from the vast Sir Norman Foster - designed airport , the beautification of the city has lined the roads with miles of elegant planted borders and clipped hedges , and smiling volunteers throng round every visitor while ignoring the yellow murk through which the sun gamely tries to shine .
With money and political will no object the risk to the Olympic movement
has always been to its reputation .
For all the economic and social advances of the past two decades , China remains a human rights pariah and the decision to bring the Games here has opened the IOC to the charge that it is complicit in abuses that stand condemned from Amnesty International to the US House of Representatives .
In 1993 , when Beijing bid to host the millennial Games which went to Sydney , the IOC judged that the violent suppression of peaceful student protests in Tiananmen Square four years earlier was too fresh a memory to be rewarded .
Eight years later its reservations were erased , thanks in part to promises from the Chinese that the cause of human rights and environmental improvement would be immeasurably assisted by the Olympics .
Those promises were at the centre of the successful bid and many in the movement remain convinced that the IOC did the right thing by coming here .
Privately most concede that not all the promises have been kept in full - the attempt to block internet access last week was a crass and avoidable example - but say the Games have helped the process of reform in China .
"" I do n't think as a movement we ever sat down and thought there was a risk involved with taking the Games to China , "" said British IOC member Sir Craig Reedie .
"" In 1993 they had bid for the 2000 Games that were won by Sydney and at that time the theory was that they were not ready .
"" They stayed away from the Athens round of bidding to address the issues and by the time the 2001 bidding came round the feeling was that they deserved the chance .
Ultimately the members were asked to decide how they could say no to a country that is home to a fifth of the world 's population . ""
The challenge for China has been the degree of interest in other areas of society that the Games has brought .
China has had to deal with political inquiries from the very start .
The IOC will claim that this has been a good and helpful process and that the Olympics have hastened the process of change in China . """
2008-08-07,"It was already billed as the sporting contest of the Beijing Olympics , but the men 's 110 m hurdles has now gained a political edge after the world record holder , Dayron Robles , added his name to a campaign for peace in Tibet and respect for human rights throughout China .
The Cuban athlete - who is expected to go head to head with China 's most famous athlete and reigning Olympic champion , Liu Xiang - was among 40 competitors who signed up to a letter issued by Amnesty International and the International Campaign for Tibet .
Coming on the eve of the opening ceremony , the inclusion of such a high - profile athlete in the letter to China 's president , Hu Jintao , underlines the problems the hosts face in trying to keep politics out of one of the games .
Since breaking Liu 's world record in June with a time of 12.87 seconds , Robles is the favourite for the 110 m event .
But he will face a crowd of 81,000 fans at the Bird 's Nest stadium , the vast majority of whom will be cheering for Liu , the first Chinese man to win an Olympic track gold .
Among the other signatories are the American 400 m runner Dee Dee Trotter , a relay gold medallist in Athens in 2004 , and the Croatian women 's world high jump champion , Blanka Vlasic .
The letter calls on Hu "" to enable a peaceful solution for the issue of Tibet and other conflicts in your country with respect to fundamental principles of human rights "" .
It asks the president to work towards freedom of expression , freedom of religion , an end to the death penalty and a halt to imprisonment of human rights defenders .
Calls to the German - based offices of Amnesty and International Campaign for Tibet , the groups that issued the letter , went unanswered ."
2008-08-07,"The rivalry between the Olympic host city 's sporting hero , Liu Xiang , the reigning 110 metres hurdles champion , and the event 's world record holder , Dayron Robles , gained a political edge yesterday when the Cuban 's name was linked to a campaign for peace in Tibet and improved human rights in China .
The Cuban was among 40 athletes who signed a letter addressed to China 's president , Hu Jintao , issued by Amnesty International and the International Campaign for Tibet .
The German arms of the two organisations , which issued the letter , yesterday said the signatures were gathered in Berlin on June 1 .
After the letter 's international publication yesterday several signatories asked for their names to be removed .
Robles was not one of them .
The letter calls on Hu "" to enable a peaceful solution for the issue of Tibet and other conflicts in your country with respect to fundamental principles of human rights "" .
It also asks the president to work towards freedom of expression , freedom of religion , an end to the death penalty and a halt to imprisonments of human rights defenders .
"" China is the focus of worldwide attention , "" the letter says .
"" Your decision on these issues will determine the success of the Olympic games and the image the world will have of China in the future . ""
Other signatories include the United States 400 m runner DeeDee Trotter and Croatia 's women 's world high jump champion , Blanka Vlasic .
The Chinese government says human rights have improved in the country , with fewer death sentences , increased numbers of religious worshippers and a temporary relaxation of travel restrictions for foreign journalists .
But the run - up to the Games has been dogged by protests and calls by foreign leaders for greater openness and respect for civil rights .
China 's foreign ministry spokesman , Qin Gang , said China opposed any use of the human rights issue to interfere in the country 's affairs . ""
The Chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens ' basic rights and freedom , "" he said in response to a speech by the American president , George Bush , which criticised China 's human rights record . ""
Chinese citizens have freedom of religion .
These are indisputable facts . ""
As Bush flew in for today 's opening ceremony three American demonstrators were dragged away from Tiananmen Square by police .
"" We come here to speak out against the human rights abuses of the Chinese government , "" shouted Patrick Mahoney , director of the Christian Defense Coalition , as officials tried to prevent the incident being filmed .
"" We are the voice of those with no voice . ""
Two British protesters who were arrested on Wednesday for displaying Free Tibet banners outside the Olympic Stadium arrived in the UK yesterday after being deported from China and banned from returning for five years .
Lucy Fairbrother , 23 , from London , and Iain Thom , 24 , from Edinburgh , members of the international Students for a Free Tibet group , back in London , said they were well treated by the Chinese authorities but called on them to enter into meaningful dialogue with the Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama .
"" The freedom movement is building , "" said Thom .
"" There will be more protests at the Games and until Tibet is free . """
2008-08-16,"As Hu Jintao opened the Olympics , the Chinese president consigned Mao to distant history and laid claim to Confucianism .
Many Chinese think that Confucianism has values which the rest of humanity could learn from .
Perhaps .
But the question is , does the Chinese regime really follow Confucius ?
And rather than talking about human rights , perhaps we should ask the Chinese government what it understands by Confucianism and the dignity of man .
China 's human rights abuses have been chronicled on numerous occasions .
And the country should not be allowed to get away with them by citing sovereignty and the length of its civilisation .
Along with India , China has often responded to attacks at the UN with a critique of international human rights norms that are based on western individualism .
Both countries say their cultures and philosophies are different .
They assert that , apart from rights , the individual also has obligations to society .
They claim that there is a balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of society over the individual .
They explain that the duties of the individual to society are higher than the western conception of absolute personal rights .
India has never really been able to articulate precisely which principles and ideas replace conventional human rights language and concepts .
But China has .
It has often invoked Confucianism as the basis of its age - old civilisation .
Confucius , like many other leading eastern philosophers , lived in a period of absolute monarchy , and understandably his political concepts relate to similarly authoritarian regimes – and China , of course , is a one - party state .
However , Confucianism does not exclude government by consensus and consequently some form of democracy .
But China can not excuse its human rights abuses and the large number of executions it carries out by citing the Confucian prerogative of the greater good of society over individual rights .
In much western political theory , the state is sovereign and has sole power to use violence legitimately by due process of law and constitutionally laid - out principles .
In return , the individual is guaranteed some rights and freedom against abuse by the state .
In eastern theories , the emphasis tends to be on the duties the individual owes to the monarch and the state .
But this is not a one - way street .
The state has duties towards the individual – not simply a duty to look after the population 's economic welfare but also uphold the dignity of individuals and show compassion to the weaker .
This is the aspect that China does not explain or elucidate in public forums .
It conveniently ignores it when defending its sovereign right to its own cultural systems .
Confucius believed in just government , a moral king , a compassionate ruler .
He believed in the concept of filial piety – the duty of the child , the younger and the ordinary citizen towards parents , elders and the powerful .
Today , the latter means the state .
But those in positions of power are expected to be wise and responsible .
They are expected to show mercy and respect the dignity of the less powerful , and hence the individual .
Governance by moral example was a Confucian maxim .
And the concept of humanitarianism exists in Confucianism as "" ren "" .
Like enlightenment philosophers , Confucius even justified rebellion against an oppressive ruler .
Perhaps we need to challenge China , not about its commitments to western - based concepts of human rights , but about its commitment to Confucianism .
We should invite China to explain what Confucius says about the duties and responsibilities of the ruler in treating subjects , criminals and those who err .
What does he say about human dignity ?
Or about respecting other people 's territory ?
Or oppressive rulers ?
These problems existed in his time as much as they do now .
Let 's talk to the Chinese regime in its own language and play its game .
Perhaps we should even invite senior members of the Chinese government to lecture us on Confucius and the dignity of the individual .
Did n't Confucius say "" Your job is to govern , not to kill "" ( Analects XII:19 ) ?"
2008-08-19,"· China 's leaders have sprung to the defence of Liu Xiang , under fire from former fans after pulling out due to injury yesterday .
"" Everyone will understand why Liu Xiang had to abandon competition , "" said vice - president , Xi Jinping , in a message carried prominently in the state media .
Xi , widely regarded as Hu Jintao 's heir apparent as president , added : "" We hope he will relax and focus on recovery .
We hope that after he recovers , he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory . ""
Nike , the sponsors of Liu , pictured far right , took out full - page adverts in his honour , while the martial arts star Jackie Chan urged people to demonstrate their "" love and support "" for the hurdler .
In an interview with the state broadcaster CCTV , Liu said he was forced out by "" unbearable "" pain .
He added : "" There 's so many people concerned about me and who support me .
I feel very sorry . ""
· Details of Sunday 's closing ceremony are still largely under wraps , but the director , Zhang Yimou , has disclosed the secret to the success of the opening spectacular : hard graft and no unions .
He suggested other countries can match China 's technology and ideas , but that their performers lack the ability "" to withstand lots of bitterness "" , citing his own "" troublesome "" experience of working in the west . ""
They only work four and a half days each week .
Every day there are two coffee breaks .
There can not be any discomfort , because of human rights , "" he said in an interview with Southern Weekend , translated by China Digital Times .
"" You could not criticise them either .
They have all kind of institutions , unions . ""
Zhang added that the opening ceremony "" had the highest level of political review since the founding of the People 's Republic of China ; basically all reviews were from the central committee level "" .
The film director said he made changes every time three leaders criticised an aspect of the show , despite the grumbles of others involved , because he regarded them as audience members . ·
Despite the city 's security drive , some Beijingers are defying Olympic regulations .
Yesterday kites could be clearly sighted in Chaoyang district - despite an edict banning them as a "" severe threat to the safety of planes coming out of the airport "" .
In all , 40 neighbourhoods have been ordered to keep skies clear of kites and homing pigeons .
Both are popular hobbies in Beijing , particularly among older residents , and elaborate kites often soar at remarkable heights above the city 's parks .
But an eight - page regulation issued by the local government in the run - up to the games warned that they posed a serious risk .
· Table tennis was invented in the 19th century and perhaps the attitudes of its officials have not progressed a great deal .
Yesterday Claude Bergeret , International Table Tennis Federation ( ITTF ) vice - president , suggested it could improve its appeal if only women wore tighter - fitting clothing .
"" We are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts , not the shirts that are made for men , but ones with more curves , "" he said .
Women 's matches have played to half - empty stands in the country fondest of the sport .
But if the game hopes to shed its old - fashioned image , it may need to work on updating its advocates rather than the shorts - and - loose - shirt ensembles favoured by most female players .
· The Chinese capital will announce new measures to ensure the smog does not roll in again after the Olympics , a senior environmental official said yesterday .
"" Beijing will be built into a liveable city , "" promised Du Shaozhong , deputy director of the city 's Environmental Protection Bureau .
"" Whether it is automobile emissions reduction , or construction site dust reduction or coal pollution reduction , I believe that the requirements will be more stringent , "" he said .
The authorities closed building sites and hundreds of factories and restricted traffic to ensure a smog - free games .
Du said that Sunday is expected to be overcast , but added that artificial cloud seeding might be used to ensure a rain - free closing ceremony , as it was for the opening ."
2008-08-22,"Gordon Brown today praised China for allowing greater media freedom during the Beijing Olympics and urged the country 's president , Hu Jintao , to continue the policy after the Games are over .
Arriving in Beijing for the end of the event , the prime minister said that he welcomed China 's decision to ease some of the restrictions facing journalists while the Olympics were being staged .
At a meeting with the Chinese president , Brown said that it would be in China 's own interest to make the easing of restrictions on journalists permanent .
After a trip that involved a visit to Afghanistan , Brown arrived in Beijing for the final days of the Games , including the formal handover to London for the 2012 Olympics at the closing ceremony on Sunday .
The question of press freedom was one of a number of human - rights issues that the prime minister raised during his one - hour meeting with the Chinese president .
Hu , in turn , used his opening remarks at their meeting in the Great Hall of the People to refer to the controversial London leg of the Olympic torch relay earlier this year . ""
When the Olympic torch ran in London , Mr Prime Minister , you personally welcomed the torch and you also expressed support for the Beijing Olympic Games for which we would like to express our appreciation and gratitude , "" he told Brown .
The event was in fact dominated by pro - Tibet protests , while Brown notoriously refused to touch the torch himself when he welcomed the relay in Downing Street .
No 10 aides insisted , however , that Hu 's comments had not been intended as a barbed reference to the torch 's reception in London and that the "" atmospherics "" between the two men had been very good .
Brown said that he had made clear that he hoped the greater openness that the Olympics had brought would not end once the Games were over .
Following pressure from international journalists , while the Olympics have been staged the Chinese have allowed access to internet sites that were previously banned in the country .
Brown told reporters : "" It is in China 's interest .
It would be a very important gesture to the rest of the world if they were to say that these restrictions could be permanently removed . ""
Brown said that he also urged the Chinese to pursue their talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama regarding greater autonomy for Tibet , in order to reach a "" productive "" conclusion when discussions reopen in the autumn .
"" I think there is more common ground between the Chinese authorities and Tibet than is sometimes realised , "" he said .
The prime minister also tackled Hu over China 's stance on Zimbabwe and Darfur , where it has been criticised for supporting repressive regimes . ""
He responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions , "" Brown said .
At his meeting with Hu , Brown also praised the "" spectacular success "" of the Beijing Games . ""
With the whole world watching , the Olympic Games have captured the imagination of the whole global community , "" he said .
"" The 2008 Beijing Olympics have set a new standard for the Olympic Games which we in London in 2012 will seek to follow . ""
The prime minister is also planning to use his visit to look at ways of ensuring that the UK 's medal haul in Beijing is not a one - off and that Britain 's athletes can build on their success in 2012 .
He will be attending a reception for some of Britain 's up - and - coming 2012 hopefuls as well as some of the remaining events where Team GB is hoping for a place in the medals .
Brown is in Beijing with his wife Sarah , and their two young sons , John , four , and Fraser , two , who were said to be excited at the prospect of seeing some of the Olympic action ."

2008-11-17,"What do you get for renouncing Taiwan and embracing Beijing instead ?
If you take Costa Rica as a guide , it wins you not only a shiny new national sports stadium but also a visit from Hu Jintao .
The Chinese president touched down in the Central American nation last night , straight from the G20 economic summit in Washington .
He brings with him plans for a free trade deal between the nations , planned to come into force by 2010 .
Beijing has already promised nearly £ 50 m , plus the loan of its finest engineers , to build a 45,000-seat national sports stadium in place of the previous crumbling 1920s version , now demolished .
Why does China love Costa Rica so much ?
Is it the avowedly pacifist constitution ?
The commitment to ecology and national parks ?
No – it all comes down to a decision in mid-2007 when the country ended more than 60 years of diplomatic relations with Taiwan to formally recognise Beijing - becoming the first Central American country to do so .
These are the latest muffled salvos in the so - called "" dollar diplomacy "" war waged globally by China and Taiwan since the latter separated itself from the mainland in 1949 following the Communists ' civil war victory .
Chiang Kai - shek 's Nationalist forces , who fled to the island , insisted they remained the one true government of China , a notion supported by most nations until the early 1970s , when the US and UN recognition of Beijing led a flood of similar defections .
Taiwan , then far more dollar - rich than its giant but struggling neighbour , began shoring up its few remaining allies through generous aid packages , focusing particularly on impoverished states in Central America , Oceania and Africa .
But as China became richer , it played the same game .
These days , if you are a would - be Taiwanese diplomat your travel prospects are limited , encompassing just four African nations , 10 tiny Pacific and Caribbean island states and the Vatican .
Plus , of course , Central America , which has remained steadfastly pro - Taipei .
The first break came with Costa Rica , even though Nicaragua 's president , Daniel Ortega , flirted with Beijing for a period .
Costa Rica is thus now Beijing 's new best friend .
Its president , Oscar Arias , was an honoured guest in China last year .
Hu 's current visit will see no fewer than 11 cooperation deals signed , aside from the free trade pact .
There are , however , some concerns in Costa Rica that a freed trade pact could see the country – a net exporter to China – flooded with Chinese goods .
Others point to China 's controversial record in Africa , where critics say its diplomatic overtures are often accompanied by a grab for natural resources .
Perhaps they 'd better hope the stadium is a good one ."

2009-03-10,"China 's president , Hu Jintao , called yesterday for a "" great wall "" of stability in Tibet on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the failed anti - Chinese uprising which led to the Dalai Lama 's flight into exile .
Angry crowds had earlier hurled homemade explosives in a Tibetan area of Qinghai province , damaging police cars , state media reported .
The unrest broke out after police stopped a truck at a checkpoint during a clampdown across Tibet and areas of western China with large Tibetan communities .
It is not known who threw the devices , which are fairly common in China .
This month is doubly sensitive , given last year 's riots in Lhasa and the subsequent disturbances .
Increased numbers of armed police are patrolling Tibetan areas and extra troops are guarding Tibet 's borders .
"" We should build a solid great wall to oppose the separatists , uphold the unity of the motherland and advance Tibet from basic stability to lasting stability , "" Hu said in comments played on state television .
He served as the Communist party 's secretary in the region during protests in 1989 .
Anti - Chinese riots broke out in Lhasa last March , apparently after peaceful protests to mark the 1959 rebellion were suppressed .
Officials say 22 people , mostly Chinese , were killed , while the Tibetan government in exile claims that scores died in the crackdown which ensued as unrest rippled across Tibetan areas .
Human rights and exile groups said yesterday that hundreds of people detained during the disturbances were still unaccounted for .
Kang Jinzhong , Communist party commissar of the people 's armed police in Tibet , told the state news agency Xinhua he expected no unrest but anti - riot forces were ready .
A senior border official said China had also deployed troops along the frontier between Tibet and south Asia .
The Dalai Lama said last week violence could break out in the region at any time .
He had earlier told followers authorities were trying to provoke them to justify an "" unimaginable forceful clampdown "" .
The Chinese accuse him of attempting to split the country , but the Tibetan spiritual leader says he seeks autonomy rather than independence .
The Dalai Lama will today call for genuine autonomy for Tibet and calls Chinese rule in the territory "" hell on Earth "" in a speech marking his half century of exile . ""
From time immemorial , the Tibetan and Chinese peoples have been neighbours .
We Tibetans are looking for a legitimate and meaningful autonomy , "" he is expected to tell thousands of Tibetans who have travelled to Dharamsala , the north Indian hill town that is home to a Tibetan government in exile , according to a draft of the address .
The speech condemns China 's policies in Tibet , with the Dalai Lama saying : "" These thrust Tibetans into such depths of suffering and hardship that they literally experienced hell on Earth .
Even today , Tibetans in Tibet live in constant fear .
"" The International Campaign for Tibet said yesterday more than 1,200 Tibetans were missing following last year 's unrest , and Amnesty International put the figure as high as 1,400 .
Both cited accounts by people detained but then released .
The Chinese foreign ministry and public security ministry did not immediately respond .
Officials said this weekend that 76 of the 953 people detained for their involvement in the Lhasa riot had been given prison sentences .
But Human Rights Watch said last November a senior official in the region reported that 1,317 people had been detained .
The group also said authorities in Gannan , Gansu province reported detaining 432 protesters , accepting the "" voluntary surrenders "" of 2,224 people , and releasing 1,870 .
It is not known what subsequently happened to the 334 people not released , including 106 monks .
"" The Chinese government has refused every external request for a real accounting of the detention , arrest and sentencing of those involved with the Tibetan protests , "" said Sophie Richardson , the group 's Asia advocacy director .
Professor Robert Barnett , an expert on Tibet at Columbia University in New York , said China 's crackdown had made the anniversary more sensitive .
"" A year ago I think it would have been important to a certain category of people in Tibet ...
But that group will now have been magnified many times over by the decisions of the last year , and the whole of China 's history in Tibet is now in front of people 's eyes .
They will be asking questions about whether it has been worthwhile , "" he said ."
2009-03-20,"Chinese authorities have detained a former soldier after he expressed regret over his role in 1989 's bloody crackdown on pro - democracy protests in Tiananmen Square , Beijing , a human rights group said today .
Zhang Shijun , 40 , published an open letter to Hu Jintao , the Chinese president and Communist leader , on the internet , urging the party and government to reconsider its condemnation of the demonstrations .
He also gave an interview to a foreign reporter on Tuesday .
According to the Associated Press ( AP ) news agency , he was called in to his local police station the following day and ordered not to speak to the foreign media .
The subject is especially sensitive because this year marks the 20th anniversary of the protests , which ended in a massacre in the Chinese capital .
Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch said a relative had told them that Zhang was taken from his home in the northern city of Tengzhou at about 2 am today .
AP reached Zhang by mobile phone this afternoon , but he said he was not at home and that it was "" not convenient to talk "" .
His wife told AP she had not heard from him or seen him .
In his interview this week , Zhang told the agency that he hoped to add momentum to calls for an investigation and reassessment of the protest movement and to further its ultimate goal of a democratic China . ""
Back then , we felt it would all be addressed in the near future .
But democracy just seems further and further away , "" he said .
"" I feel like my spirit is stuck there on the night of 3 June , "" he said , referring to the date when the military was ordered to clear the square .
Zhang said his unit , the 54th army , came under attack as it approached the square and some of the soldiers fired over the heads of civilians as a warning .
But he said he knew of no deaths caused by his unit .
Official files on the events remain closed , but reports by witnesses suggest that most of the hundreds of deaths took place in other parts of Beijing .
Zhang said other details were still too sensitive to reveal .
According to AP , Zhang asked for an early discharge because he had not expected to be sent to fight ordinary Chinese citizens .
He was arrested in 1992 after beginning a discussion group promoting market economics and politics , and sentenced to three years in a labour camp for political crimes .
He claimed those charges were in retaliation for his decision to leave the army early ."

Hundreds of people died when the army forced its way to the centre of Beijing to clear the largely student demonstrators from the political heart of the capital in 1989 .
The Communist party has not changed its verdict that the protests were a "" counter - revolutionary incident "" .
The mainland - based Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch said Zhang was taken from his home in the northern city of Tengzhou at around 2 am yesterday , citing a relative .

2009-03-31,"Gordon Brown will enter talks with China today to see if it would be willing to commit extra funds to fighting a world recession in return for greater voting powers on multilateral institutions , including the IMF and World Bank .
Brown will hold talks with Hu Jintao , China 's president , following discussions with Barack Obama , amid signs that developing countries see the G20 summit as a chance to impose a new world order and end the era of Anglo - European dominance .
Brown regards the remaking of global financial institutions as a key part of the summit and is optimistic that the Chinese will find extra money , even though Beijing believes western banking and morality have damaged the world economy .
British diplomats see China 's willingness to participate in the big international institutions as one of the few gains of the world recession .
The Chinese have nearly $ 2trillion in foreign exchange reserves , and have become increasingly concerned at the security of their loans to the US .
Brown has said he hopes to increase funding for the IMF to at least $ 500bn from $ 250bn .
The EU has promised to lend an extra $ 75bn and Japan an extra $ 100bn .
Obama , with whom Brown spoke on the phone yesterday on his plane trip to London , has offered an extra $ 100bn , so the Chinese , along with the Saudis , may make up the shortfall .
The draft summit communique leaked at the beginning of the week was silent on how much extra funding should go to the IMF from bilateral borrowing , nor did it engage with how much extra money should go to multilateral development banks or how much extra money would be given over the next two years to support trade finance through export credit and investment agencies .
In return for funding , the Chinese have been seeking more IMF voting rights , and the summit will agree to a review of these next year with the work completed by January 2011 , earlier than previously planned .
Similarly the World Bank will complete reforms to shareholding , voting and internal governance by next spring .
The US has also agreed that the financial stability forum , a group of largely western finance ministers and bank governors , should be expanded to include all G20 countries and give it a stronger mandate as the financial stability board .
The new membership will include Argentina , Brazil , South Africa and China .
Robert Zoellick , the World Bank 's president , emphasised the need to give multilateral bodies new powers , rather than just extra financing .
In a speech in London yesterday Zoellick said : "" If leaders are serious about creating new global responsibilities or governance , let them start by modernising multilateralism to empower the WTO , the IMF , and the World Bank Group to monitor national policies . ""
Bringing sunlight to national decision - making would contribute to transparency , accountability and consistency across national policies .
"" As a first step , the G20 should endorse a WTO monitoring system to advance trade and resist economic isolationism , while working to complete the Doha negotiations to open markets , cut subsidies , and resist backsliding . """
2009-04-01,"It was , observers can agree , the only real question of import in the run - up to last night 's summit dinner .
Some might have concerned themselves with whether Russia and the US would agree a reduction in nuclear weapons , or how the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , and his American counterpart , Barack Obama , would hit it off in their first face - to - face meeting , but experienced diplomats know those are not the encounters that matter .
What really counts is who sits next to whom at dinner .
By that measure , the seating plan for last night 's banquet at Downing Street for the G20 leaders represented a taut little gavotte of diplomatic musical chairs , with every request for the salt representing a lavish favour or small slight with potentially cataclysmic consequences for international relations .
Certainly there were some surprises .
As host of the event , Gordon Brown sat at the centre of one side of the long banqueting table , with the coveted spot on his right - hand side occupied by Hu , allowing intense discussion of the perils of protectionism over the entrees .
Contrary to expectations , however , the American president was not on Brown 's immediate left , but found himself sitting on the other side of the table and two spaces along to the left .
That left two seats between the men , one next to Brown and one next to Obama , for the presidents of Indonesia and South Korea , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Lee Myung - bak , making them the most favoured - and very possibly the most surprised - world leaders of the evening .
The particularly cherished "" footsie "" position directly opposite Brown , meanwhile , was taken by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , permitting as much discussion of arms sales as any British leader could hope for .
These are not the times for banqueting , and the dignitaries instead tucked into a traditional "" best of British "" menu of Scottish salmon with samphire and Irish soda bread , roast Welsh lamb with Jersey royals and asparagus , and Bakewell tart and custard to finish .
Jamie Oliver , who catered for the event along with a parallel dinner for spouses hosted by Sarah Brown , declared himself "" very , very proud of my country and its food traditions "" .
Nicholas Sarkozy had declared he might walk out of the summit if was unable to secure what he wanted , and Brown , after loftily dismissing the threat not to stay for dessert at his morning press conference , offered the French president a seat as flattering as it was slightly uncomfortable , next to Hu .
Chinese leaders , as we know , do not always respond charitably to rebuff .
Also bought off with a good seat was the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , who insisted earlier this week that she would not be bounced into action , and for her pains was placed to Obama 's right .
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , Argentina 's president and the only other woman present , won the coveted spot opposite the American leader .
But the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , may have rankled at his position between Mexico and Turkey and opposite South Africa , a full five seats away from the US president .
Exiled to social Siberia at the ends of the table were those guests who were not world leaders , the leaders of the World Bank , IMF and WTO , with the prime ministers of Canada and Australia urged to do the decent family thing next to them .
Similarly shunned , and one suspects not terribly surprised , was the Czech prime minister , Mirek Topolanek , who had described the US - proposed global rescue package as the "" road to hell "" .

2009-04-02,"It is possible to overstate the importance of seating plans , but it is no accident that Hu Jintao was placed to the right of Gordon Brown at last night 's Downing Street dinner : China may well hold the swing vote in today 's negotiations at the G20 .
Almost alone among the big economies , China is still emphatically in the ascendancy .
It might have all the same anxieties about the collapse of world trade as the others , but it can rightly claim the economic high ground in a way that France and Germany can only dream of .
More importantly , it holds the key to many of the competing aspirations of other leaders .
President Sarkozy has already identified the Middle Kingdom as the biggest obstacle to a crackdown on tax havens and international financial regulation – fearing Hu is overly protective of the offshore financial role played by Hong Kong and Macau .
If President Obama is to push ahead with fiscal stimulus he needs to keep persuading China to lend it money by buying US Treasury bills .
And if Gordon Brown is to achieve his stated goal of rebalancing world trade , he needs to encourage China to become a nation of importers as well as a nation of exporters .
All this comes as China finally shakes off its timidity on the world stage .
Since the Olympics , Beijing has shown new confidence in international affairs – even talking about replacing the US dollar with a new global reserve currency .
Yesterday 's bilateral meeting between President Obama and President Hu was privately dubbed the G2 – in recognition of its primacy over the G20 .
Today it may feel like the G1 .

2009-05-18,"Yasheng Huang makes a strong case in his article ( China 's rise relied on a rural miracle , 18 May ) and in his recent book for the 1980s model of Chinese development .
Certainly , the lack of protests in the countryside was a key factor in the suppression of the 1989 protests , and certainly Hu Jintao has shown more concern for non - urban development than his predecessor as Communist party leader , Jiang Zemin .
But the urban - rural gap is not narrowing , and some of the enterprises worst hit by the current downturn are the heirs of the Town and Village Enterprises ( TVEs ) that spearheaded growth in the 1980s .
They are n't benefiting much from the $ 1 trillion sloshing out in China in fiscal and monetary stimulus .
That money is going mainly to big urban - based firms , while the drop in remittances from migrant workers in coastal export zones is hitting village income , deflation is reducing income from sales of food , farm input costs have risen and mechanisation is uneconomic in many places , given the small size of plots allowed under the land ownership system - which the leadership declines to reform .
The need for the People 's Republic to boost consumption has long been recognised .
The official heading the staff of the Communist party 's leading economic group acknowledges the need to rebalance the economy .
But , by giving priority to big firms , which are politically reliable and can be counted on to protect employment , the policy response to the current downturn seems to be reinforcing the old model rather than facilitating the necessary move to a new one - let alone a switch back to the 1980s .

2009-07-08,"Chinese security forces put on a show of strength in the capital of Xinjiang province today as Hu Jintao , China 's president , cut short his trip to Italy for the G8 summit to return home and deal with continuing ethnic violence .
Helicopters hovered , loudspeaker vans broadcast messages urging calm and hundreds of paramilitary officers marched around the city chanting .
Hundreds more guarded the perimeter of the city 's largely Uighur area , several with bayonets .
Water cannon could be seen on the streets and security forces were armed with guns , crossbows , riot shields and batons .
Li Zhi , head of Urumqi 's communist party , pledged to execute those responsible for the 156 deaths or more in vicious attacks on Sunday .
More than 1,100 people were wounded and more than 1,400 have been arrested .
But in a sign of continuing tension , Han Chinese residents turned on security forces who stopped their attack on a Uighur man in the afternoon .
A witness said members of a crowd of numbering in the hundreds lashed out at paramilitary police as they pulled out ringleaders .
Some asked why they were protecting Uighurs .
Since Sunday there have been brutal Uighur attacks on Han and Han attacks on Uighur .
But the growing security presence in the city meant authorities could use teargas to disperse a large Han mob – armed with meat cleavers , metal bars and other weapons – as they tried to force their way into a predominantly Uighur area yesterday .
The government has given no details of injuries or deaths in the last day and has not offered a breakdown of the overall death toll by ethnicity . ""
Most of the public were quite restrained , "" Li said of yesterday 's unrest , addressing a press conference . ""
A handful of Han attacked Uighurs and there were a handful of Uighurs who attacked Han .
This handful of violent elements has been caught by the police and now the situation has been quelled . ""
An overnight curfew appeared to have calmed the situation this morning , but both ethnic groups feared further violence .
"" There 's too big an emotional conflict between Han and Uighur people , "" said shop owner Cai Jixing .
Other Han said they were still bitterly angry about Sunday 's violence .
"" Uighurs are spoiled like pandas .
When they steal , rob , rape or kill , they can get away with it .
If we Han did the same thing , we 'd be executed , "" shop owner Li Yufang told Reuters .
Few businesses in the centre of Urumqi were open yesterday , but a sizable number of residents were out and about .
Some applauded as security forces marched past .
In Uighur areas , the streets were busy and one man said he felt safer because paramilitary police were protecting them from Han .
But another told the Guardian : "" We do n't dare go into the city because of the look in their eyes .
When the Han see Uighurs or other minority people their eyes do n't look right .
They look like they want to eat us up .
They look very evil .
"" There was no official curfew last night but vans broadcast messages urging people to go home and ignore rumours .
Chinese authorities have cut internet connections and text messaging services in Urumqi , possibly because wild stories often spread at speed by those means .
State media have also published editorials calling for calm .
The authorities have accused Uighur exiles of orchestrating the initial outbreak of violence .
The World Uighur Congress has denied the claims and in turn accused security forces of killing demonstrators in a brutal crackdown on peaceful protests .
While Uighurs in the city have a number of complaints about the authorities , from government policies in general to mass arrests this week , none of those to whom the Guardian has spoken so far have suggested people died at the hands of security forces .
One man said mostly Uighurs were killed on Sunday but gave wildly differing death tolls in succession – from "" some "" to several thousand – and said that Han citizens were responsible ."
2009-07-27,"First came direct flights , then freight links , and now a single telegram .
The presidents of Taiwan and China exchanged direct messages today for the first time in 60 years , in the latest sign of their thawing relations .
Hu Jintao wrote to Taiwan 's Ma Ying - jeou to mark the latter 's election as chairman of the Nationalist party .
Bacuse of the enduring mutual sensitivities , the message was sent simply to Mr Ma , while Ma 's reply was addressed to Hu as general secretary of the Communist party .
Beijing still claims sovereignty over Taiwan , which has been self - ruled since Chiang Kai - shek fled there following his defeat in the civil war in 1949 .
China has warned it could use force if Taipei pursued formal independence .
"" I hope our two parties can continue to promote peaceful cross - strait development , deepen mutual trust , bring good news to compatriots on both sides and create a revival of the great Chinese race , "" said Hu in his telegram .
"" We should continue efforts to consolidate peace in the Taiwan Strait and rebuild regional stability , "" Ma replied , adding that they should "" put aside disputes "" .
Ma was elected president in spring last year on a platform of improving relations with China and because of widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling Democratic People 's party .
But while he has signed landmark trade deals , he has avoided political issues , due in large part to powerful anti - Beijing sentiment on the island .
Lin Chong - pin , a strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taipei , told Reuters that the telegram suggested the Chinese leader wants to meet Ma eventually .
"" It 's sort of expected ...
It is in Hu Jintao 's benefit or advantage to meet , "" Lin said .
"" It would be a personal feat . ""
But analysts believe both sides may take years to weigh up the risks before proceeding ."
2009-09-18,"North Korean leader Kim Jong - il has said he is willing to engage in multilateral talks , Chinese state media reported today , in what appeared to be a conciliatory shift that could pave the way for the reopening of disarmament negotiations .
But sceptics have warned that the North may be seeking the relaxation of UN sanctions – which were toughened after its nuclear and missile tests earlier this year – without being willing to make significant concessions . ""
North Korea would like to solve relevant issues through bilateral and multilateral talks , "" Kim told Chinese president Hu Jintao 's special envoy , according to China 's official Xinhua news agency .
It added that Dai Bingguo handed the leader a letter from Hu .
Pyongyang had previously demanded a one - on - one discussion with Washington .
It pulled out of the six - nation denuclearisation talks following the tightening of sanctions , saying that the process infringed its sovereignty .
The North 's official Korean Central News Agency reported an "" amicable "" meeting to discuss the countries ' relations and issues of mutual concern .
Chinese premier Wen Jiabao is expected to visit the North in October to mark the anniversary of the two countries ' alliance .
Pyongyang is heavily dependent on Beijing 's support but the two have an uneasy relationship – one reason the North is so keen to hold direct talks with Washington .
The US has said that bilateral discussions with the North could be worthwhile to bring the state back into the six - party negotiations , which also involve China , Russia , South Korea and Japan .
The South 's president , Lee Myung - bak , said earlier this week that the North showed no signs of giving up nuclear weapons and was adopting a "" conciliatory strategy "" because it was feeling the pain of sanctions .
Despite proffering olive branches to Washington and Seoul recently – via the release of two imprisoned US journalists and the lifting of border restrictions with the South – Pyongyang has continued to develop its nuclear programme .
Earlier this month it claimed to be in the final stages of enriching uranium , which would give it a second way to make nuclear devices . ""
North Korea will be keeping up the pressure on its part in order to raise the stakes , "" Yang Moo - jin of the University of North Korea Studies told Reuters . ""
But , especially now that Kim Jong - il has pledged to talk , the prospects are not too bad . ""
However , Kenneth Boutin of Deakin University in Australia said : "" There is a growing body of thought that the North Korean leadership has no intention of abandoning its nuclear weapons programme , and it may well turn out to be the case that their understanding of ' denuclearisation ' is far different from ours . """
2009-09-21,"China and India appeared poised for bold new action on climate change ahead of a major UN summit tomorrow , in moves that will significantly increase pressure on President Barack Obama to deliver cuts in US emissions .
The UN climate chief , Yvo de Boer , said today that he expects China 's president , Hu Jintao , to announce a series of new measures tomorrow that would put the country well ahead of America in dealing with climate change .
Meanwhile , India 's environment minister , Jairam Ramesh , told the Guardian his government planned to make "" aggressive "" cuts in India 's emissions .
The Chinese and Indian measures — if fully realised — could represent a breakthrough in bringing them into a global climate change deal at a UN summit in Copenhagen in December .
Almost all observers say the Copenhagen talks are dangerously stalled .
"" This suite of policies will take China to be a world leader on addressing climate change , and it will be quite ironic to hear that expressed tomorrow in a country ( the United States ) that is firmly convinced that China is doing nothing to address climate change , "" De Boer said .
China , India and other developing countries between them will account for more than two - thirds of the world 's emissions by 2020 , but they argue they can not sacrifice economic growth and poverty relief to reducing carbon emissions , especially if the industrialised world does not take decisive action on its own emissions .
But China and India now appear to be demonstrating a new willingness to act — even in the absence of a firm commitment from America , where Obama is struggling to deliver on a promise of an economy - wide plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
In an interview with the Guardian , India 's environment minister , Jairam Ramesh , sketched out a series of measures he said would go some distance to cutting India 's emissions , so - called mitigation measures . ""
India is going to aggressively take on voluntary mitigration outcomes , "" he said .
"" We are now going to go for domestic legislation [ which ] will enshrine some targets . ""
These include a mandatory fuel efficiency target which would come into effect in 2011 ; a more energy efficient building code which would come into effect in 2012 ; and an increase in electricity produced from renewable sources to 20 % by 2020 .
The government was also stepping up efforts to stop deforestation , raising its target for tree cover to 15 % by 2020 .
He said these measures and others were designed to reduce India 's energy intensity by a further 5 to 10 % . ""
What India is going to do is to set a target date which is 2020 and introduce a quantitative outcome which is an implicit mitigation target — not explicit target .
We will enshrine that into law so that there is a degree of credibility . ""
However , Ramesh said India would not compromise on its ambitions of achieving 8 % economic growth a year .
The plans could also fall hostage to India 's political scene , where there are sensitivities at being seen to be giving in to pressure from the developed world .
Ed Miliband , the climate change secretary , said that recent moves by India , China and other developing nations had improved the chances of a comprehensive global warming deal at Copenhagen .
But , writing in tomorrow 's Guardian , he warned that a new kind of diplomacy was needed : "" We must be in this together rather than looking for who to blame .
The fate of every nation on earth hangs on the outcome of Copenhagen .
It is too important to play the cards close - to - your - chest poker games that marked diplomacy of the 20th century . ""
Miliband also noted a new report from economist Lord Stern which showed that , even with the limited commitments so far , the world was within striking range of meeting 2020 targets for cutting emissions sufficiently to keep the earth from warming beyond 2C. Stern , in a speech at Columbia University later today , was expected to present a report showing the world was on course to reduce overall emissions from today 's global total of 50 gigatonnes to 48 gigatonnes .
That is not so far off the figure of 44 gigatonnes needed to avoid catastrophic global warming .
Emissions , in the absence of the actions so far agreed , would rise to 65 gigatonnes by 2020 .
However , leaders of countries on the sharp end of climate change did not share Miliband 's optimism .
Bharrat Jagdeo , Guyana 's president , told The Guardian he feared the deal now beginning to take shape could seriously weaken targets for reducing emissions compared to the targets demanded by scientists .
That would be a calamity for Guyana , which loses some 10 % of its GDP annually to flooding .
Jagdeo said he was worried about what sort of funds would be established to help shield poor countries from the worst effects of climate change . ""
The negotiation process is not leading to the type of agreement that we want in Copenhagen , "" Jagdeo said .
"" We have basically farmed out the negotiations to technical people and most of them are at the limit of what we can agree to .
What we need are leaders to break their silence and come up with new policies . ""
Ramesh also had reduced expectations for Copenhagen .
He held out little hope of a broad agreement to cut emissions that will keep global warming within 2C , a view echoed in an influential report in China last week .
Instead , in his view , there was only broad agreement on the need for a fund to protect poor countries from the worst ravages of climate change , a plan to help developing countries adopt new clean energy technology , and another programme — with funding from the industrialised world — to reduce deforestation in the developing world .
"" It 's an easier option if you do n't have to change your lifestyle , you do n't have to cut emissions directly .
All you have to do is put some money into a forest in India or Papua New Guinea or somewhere , "" Ramesh said .
The UN is hoping to break through that pessimism by getting world leaders directly involved with climate change at the summit on Tuesday and beyond .
The prime minister , Gordon Brown , has agreed to go to Copenhagen and is encouraging other leaders to attend the negotiations in the hopes of producing a stronger agreement .
"" This is too important to be left to the negotiators .
Negotiators have their role but leaders are the people who are going to make this happen , "" said Miliband ."
2009-09-22,"China took a step forward yesterday in the delicate diplomatic dance of international climate change talks , by committing to a unspecified carbon target .
But President Hu Jintao failed to reveal to a UN summit the major measures needed to inject pace into the lethargic negotiations , aimed at delivering a treaty to avoid catastrophic global warming .
While the move by China fell short of its billing , it — and a similar recent change of rhetoric from India — added to pressure on the US and other developed countries to accept deep cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions .
But President Barack Obama , addressing 100 world leaders at the summit in New York , also failed to offer any bold initiatives .
Both leaders used strong language in pledging to live up to their responsibilities as the world 's biggest polluters in preventing runaway warming . ""
No nation , however large or small , wealthy or poor , can escape the impact of climate change , "" he said .
"" The security and stability of each nation and all peoples — our prosperity , our health , and our safety — are in jeopardy .
And the time we have to reverse this tide is running out , "" Obama said .
With less than 11 weeks to go to the final round of climate talks in Copenhagen , the UN chief , Ban Ki - Moon did not bother to hide his frustration in his opening remarks .
"" The world 's glaciers are now melting faster than human progress to protect them — or us , "" he said .
Others shared his gloom . ""
Today we are on a path to failure , "" said France 's Nicolas Sarkozy .
Obama , under pressure to demonstrate America 's commitment to action , made an important gesture in acknowledging the responsibility of the industrialised world for the dangerous sea level rises and other consequences of global warming that are now threatening the developing world . ""
Yes , the developed nations that caused much of the damage to our climate over the last century still have a responsibility to lead , "" he said .
But Obama pointedly did not let the most rapidly developing economies — China , India , and Brazil — off the hook , illustrating the impasse that has blocked progress to date . ""
Those rapidly growing developing nations that will produce nearly all the growth in global carbon emissions in the decades ahead must do their part as well , "" Obama said .
"" They will need to commit to strong measures at home and agree to stand behind those commitments just as the developed nations must stand behind their own .
We can not meet this challenge unless all the largest emitters of greenhouse gas pollution act together .
There is no other way .
"" China 's leader , in his much anticipated speech , also acknowledged the urgency of reaching a deal at Copenhagen , and called on the industrialised world and developing countries which have often clashed over climate change to find common cause .
"" We should make our endeavour on climate change a win - win for both developed and developing countries , "" he said .
Hu said that China was factoring climate change into its long - range economic strategy , and offered a new pledge to reduce "" carbon intensity "" by a "" notable margin "" by 2020 , ie move to a cleaner economy by cutting the emissions released in producing each unit of GDP .
But he did not say what that target would be or when it would be announced .
The proposal from China to reduce the carbon intensity of its economic growth could be helpful but much depends on how significant the cuts are , a key US official said .
"" It depends on what the number is , "" Todd Stern , President Barack Obama 's special envoy for climate change , told reporters .
Rich countries should ensure poor states have access to the money and technology needed to move to that clean energy economy , he said .
Today 's summit was a particular challenge for Obama to show he can deliver on his promise for action on global warming .
The Senate has delayed taking up his climate change bill , which barely squeaked through the House of Representatives in June .
He used the spotlight to list action taken on environment on his watch .
"" I am proud to say that the United States has done more to promote clean energy and reduce carbon pollution in the last eight months than at any other time in our history , "" he said .
But NGOs said both the US and China should have gone further .
Oxfam 's director , Barbara Stocking , said Hu and Obama 's speeches lacked specific details .
"" It sounded like Hu was being positive about moving forward together but he did n't put any [ major ] new things on the table which is a shame at this stage in the negotiations , "" she said .
"" Fundamentally what we need is for the leaders to come out now to set the tone for the whole deal .
"" "" President Obama 's speech was a major missed opportunity .
The president unfortunately did not deliver what other nations were hoping to hear , namely , a commitment to work with the Senate leadership on a game plan for getting through the Senate , on a timetable commensurate with the urgency of the climate challenge , a bill that caps America 's greenhouse gas emissions , "" said Jennifer Haverkamp , the director of international climate negotiations for the Environmental Defence Fund ."
2009-09-22,"Chinese president Hu Jintao today broke new ground in his nation 's action on climate change , but failed to deliver measures that would significantly stir up the stagnant negotiations towards an international treaty to fight global warming .
For the first time , Hu promised to set a target for reducing the rate at which China 's greenhouse gas emissions are rising .
The pledge to reduce China 's so - called carbon intensity means total emissions will still grow , but the fossil fuel burned for each rise in economic growth will fall by a "" notable margin "" by 2020 , compared with 2005 levels .
It represents a concession to rich nations such as the US who were demanding some kind of action before taking on deep cuts themselves . ""
Out of a sense of responsibility to the world and its people , "" Hu said , China has tackled climate change and will continue to do so .
UN secretary Ban Ki Moon thanked Hu for his "" important commitment "" but Hu failed to set a figure for the intensity cut , or a date by which China 's total emissions would start falling .
Hu reiterated China 's goal of 15 % of its energy to be renewable by 2020 , to plant 40 m hectares of trees and to offer aid to the poorest developing nations facing the impacts of climate change .
A few moments before , US President Barack Obama had spoken strongly on the need to act on global warming but offered no new proposals that could jumpstart stalled talks on a UN climate pact .
He faces severe opposition at home against proposed laws to cut US emissions .
In his speech , Obama said time was running out to address the problem .
"" Our generation 's response to this challenge will be judged by history , for if we fail to meet it — boldly , swiftly , and together — we risk consigning future generations to an irreversible catastrophe , "" he said .
"" The time we have to reverse this tide is running out .
"" Observers had hoped the United States and China — the world 's biggest polluters — would inject momentum , just over two months before 190 nations gather in Copenhagen aiming to complete a climate treaty .
Moon , who called the unprecedented meeting , said talks were moving too slowly .
"" Failure to reach broad agreement in Copenhagen would be morally inexcusable , economically short - sighted and politically unwise , "" Ban said .
But Michael Levi , from the Council on Foreign Relations in the US , was disappointed with Hu 's speech .
"" Does n't seem that he made the much - anticipated significant announcement that people were hoping for , "" he tweeted .
Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former vice president Al Gore in 2007 had reminded the leaders that "" the science leaves us with no room for inaction now . ""
Yesterday , India 's environment minister , Jairam Ramesh , told the Guardian his government planned to make "" aggressive "" cuts in India 's emissions , placing additional pressure on rich nations to respond by agreeing deep cuts .
Today 's UN summit and the G20 summit in Pittsburgh later this week have been seen as a last chance for world leaders to accelerate the complex negotiations .
These resume next week in Bangkok , where officials will aim to turn 200 pages of draft agreement , heavily caveated , into more meaningful document ."
2009-09-22,"Chinese president Hu Jintao is expected to lay down the gauntlet on climate change in New York today with a promise to reduce its carbon intensity — the rate at which emissions increase , while still being able to grow its economy .
In a speech to the United Nations , Hu will declare that China is ready to pioneer a new low - carbon path of development , make a commitment to increase forest cover and pledge financial support for poorer nations to adapt to global warming , according to a source close to his delegation .
Chinese media organisations have been told to prepare for a major announcement , amid speculation that the president could also set a mid - term goal for reducing energy intensity which is measured in emissions relative to GDP — and possibly even announce a date after 2030 when the country 's carbon emissions might peak .
The Chinese government is confident that the package of measures will be seen as a major move away from business as usual , putting pressure on Europe and the United States to set bolder targets for reducing emissions ahead of the Copenhagen summit .
A key element is expected to be a commitment to a carbon - intensity goal , which would aim to reduce emissions relative to GDP growth .
Until now , China has not included carbon calculations in its economic planning .
Government officials have been working on a new methodology , based primarily on existing targets for energy efficiency .
Environmental groups said the adoption of a carbon - intensity target would help international negotiators to talk the same language and encourage domestic industries to reduce their use of coal .
"" People in China will finally start saying ' what is a carbon economy ? ' , "" said Yang Fuqiang , director of Global Climate Solutions at the World Wildlife Fund 's Beijing office .
He predicted the move would bolster carbon trading and moves to introduce a carbon tax .
How powerful an impact this makes will depend on the size of the carbon intensity targets .
It is unclear whether Hu will announce a figure or leave that to be determined by bureaucrats .
If the state repeats its current five - year pledge to reduce energy intensity by 20 % , then China could save 4.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide between 2005 and 2020 , said Yang .
Yang Ailun , climate change coordinator at Greenpeace , said this would be roughly in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
"" If China follows the scientists ' advice , it would send a strong signal to the United States .
It would be a really very good target . ""
A mid - term carbon intensity target could also pave the way for the government to set a goal for China 's overall emissions to peak .
A recent study by the country 's top energy think - tank estimated this could come between 2030 and 2035 in a best case scenario .
In summarising the measures China is taking to address climate change , Hu is likely to note domestic afforestation efforts , investment in renewable energy and funds provided to developing nations to adapt to changing weather patterns .
But there is uncertainty about whether he will set a date for emissions to peak .
"" Everyone is expecting a lot , but look at the reality , "" said Wu Changhua , China director of the Climate Group .
"" I do n't think there will be a big surprise . """
2009-09-22,"The "" c word "" entered the vocabulary of a Chinese president for the first time today , as Hu Jintao promised his country would set its first carbon target for 2020 .
Overall greenhouse gas emissions will not fall , but the fossil fuels burned in powering each surge of the economy will decline - a cut in so - called carbon intensity .
For the moment , it is a breakthrough of terminology more than substance .
But in promising such a goal , Hu has effectively declared that China - the world 's biggest polluter - has an important card to play in negotiations towards a global climate change treaty in Copenhagen .
Until now , China has not included carbon emissions in its economic planning , though government officials have been working on a new methodology , based primarily on existing targets for energy efficiency .
How significant this new target proves to be will depend on the amount .
During his speech to the United Nations , Hu coyly kept that figure close to his chest , saying only that China would reduce the quantity of its carbon emissions relative to GDP by a "" notable margin "" .
This was the highlight of what was otherwise a summary of measures that Beijing has already announced to address climate change , including tree - planting campaigns , a commitment to supporting the developing world , and efforts to raise the amount of renewables in the energy mix to 15 % by 2020 .
The Chinese media had been primed to expect a decisive move away from business as usual .
This did not come , but the presentation and language were noteworthy .
Environmental groups said the adoption of a carbon - intensity target would help encourage domestic industries to reduce their use of coal , which currently accounts for 70 % of the China 's energy .
"" People in China will finally start saying ' what is a carbon economy ? ' , "" said Yang Fuqiang , director of global climate solutions at the WWF Beijing office .
He predicted the move would bolster plans for carbon trading and moves to introduce a carbon tax .
The key , however , will be how far China moves away from its current energy - intensive model of growth .
If the state continues its current five - year pledge to reduce carbon intensity by 20 % , it is estimated that China could save 4.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide between 2005 and 2020 - a cut from business - as - usual of more than 50 % - and a globally significant amount of carbon .
A 2020 energy intensity target could also pave the way for the government to set a goal for China 's overall emissions to peak , a key milestone .
A recent study by the country 's top energy thinktank estimated this could come between 2030 and 2035 in a best - case scenario .
But at a state level , this has not been made public .
It is likely to be used as a bargaining chip .
China is pressing Europe and the United States to set bolder targets for reducing their emissions and providing money and technology to the developing world .
China has taken significant steps in the past five years to become more carbon efficient , but its economy is growing so fast these gains have been swamped .
There remains much talk of the need to move to a low - carbon economy , but as yet few specifics .
In the delicate choreography of the negotiations , the world 's biggest emitter of carbon is not yet ready to reveal how far , if at all , it is willing to move off its current - highly polluting - path of growth ."
2009-09-22,"In his speech to the UN climate summit , the Chinese premier , Hu Jintao , signalled his country 's willingness to adopt some form of carbon intensity target as part of a new deal on climate change .
This is indeed a welcome step , and – if matched by clearer indication from President Obama about US willingness to make substantial early cuts – may prove to have laid solid foundations for a successful outcome at the crucial UN talks at Copenhagen in December .
The Chinese move disappointed some commentators who had hoped for more specific and stringent measures than the premier 's promise to reduce carbon intensity by "" a notable margin "" .
But more significantly for now , perhaps , is that Hu 's gesture appears deliberately calculated to support Obama in his stand - off with the many senators who still resist US legislation on emissions reduction .
The Chinese signal to take action removes Obama 's opponents ' principal excuse – which is that the US should not have to act unilaterally and without reciprocal measures from China .
The setting out of the country 's positions at the UN in this way could thus be a critical factor in raising the chances of a successful deal .
It is , however , at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh later this week that even more critical breakthroughs could be made .
Finance ministers from the G20 have met in recent months to discuss climate change finance .
This is a big deal , at least as big an issue as Chinese and American emissions reductions commitments .
Unfortunately , however , little progress has been made .
Major developing countries have been reluctant to discuss money without knowing what kind of cuts the big historic polluters will sign up to .
The funders , basically the richer western countries , have been reluctant to talk about finance because many of them face disastrous domestic finances .
The money is needed to help vulnerable poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change , to provide incentives to tropical countries to cut deforestation and to facilitate the transfer of technology .
To do all this will require a lot of money .
Gordon Brown suggested back in June that the bill by 2020 will be about $ 100bn a year .
While others say it is much more than that , it is clear that the finances presently available from developed countries ' governments and carbon markets are nowhere near what is required .
This is problematic , and will require real leadership to solve .
The politics of the situation dictate that in addition to setting out their intention to make major early cuts , the historic polluters will need to put some major money on the table in Copenhagen .
To do this will require the kind of decisive interventions recently made to stabilise the financial system .
Some $ 4tn - worth of stimulus packages and bailouts were deployed for that .
While party leaders will be queuing up during the party conference season to outdo each other on the scale of public spending cuts they will make , they need to say where the money to save the climate will come from .
Having sold the family silver to prop up a bonus - corrupted financial system , they must now mobilise the resources to stablise the climate , for without money there will not be a worthwhile deal , and without a worthwhile deal the consequences of climate change will make the financial crisis seem like a walk in the park ."
2009-09-22,"President Obama 's historic address to the UN climate summit makes clear he will bring all of his political and rhetorical skills to achieving a strong domestic climate bill – and an international deal – in the coming months .
President Hu Jintao 's speech makes clear that China is also prepared to take strong action at home to enable an international deal .
President Obama asserted that failure to act "" boldly , swiftly , and together "" risks "" consigning future generations to an irreversible catastrophe "" : No nation , however large or small , wealthy or poor , can escape the impact of climate change ....
The security and stability of each nation and all peoples – our prosperity , our health , our safety – are in jeopardy .
And the time we have to reverse this tide is running out .
Obama became the first president to ever acknowledge that the US has failed to live up to its responsibility to act : It is true that for too many years , mankind has been slow to respond to or even recognize the magnitude of the climate threat .
It is true of my own country as well .
We recognise that ....
Yes , the developed nations that caused much of the damage to our climate over the last century still have a responsibility to lead .
President Obama pointed out that his administration has made remarkable strides in accelerating clean energy deployment and reversing emissions trends : "" I am proud to say that the United States has done more to promote clean energy and reduce carbon pollution in the last eight months than at any other time in our history ....
And already , we know that the recent drop in overall U.S. emissions is due in part to steps that promote greater efficiency and greater use of renewable energy .
"" In fact , Obama 's announcement last week of national standards for new vehicle fuel economy and exhaust pipe greenhouse gas emission is "" the single biggest step the American government has ever taken to cut greenhouse - gas emissions , "" as one US analyst put it .
But Obama also acknowledged that much , much more needs to be done .
At a national level , he pledged US action on "" slashing our emissions to reach the targets we set for 2020 and our long - term goal for 2050 . ""
For those who do n't follow US climate politics closely , this means he is committed to passage through the Senate of a climate and clean energy bill with targets for 2020 and 2050 similar to those found in the recently - passed House of Representatives bill – which are also similar to what he campaigned on .
The 2050 target is a more than 80 % reduction from 2005 levels .
The 2020 target remains a subject of some debate .
The House bill require a 17 % cut – while creating a large pool of money to invest in strategies for reducing deforestation that would achieve the equivalent of a further 10 % reduction .
This is not adequate from a scientific perspective , but it is an inevitable political result after a decade of delay and obstruction from Obama 's predecessor , George Bush .
America will be starting its emissions reductions efforts a decade later then the other developed countries , and so politically our near - term target is weaker than it needs to be be .
Obama also made news by announcing : "" Later this week , I will work with my colleagues at the G20 to phase out fossil fuel subsidies so that we can better address our climate challenge . ""
Certainly , these subsidies are a major impediment to an accelerated transition to clean energy .
Finally , President Hu Jintao continued China 's remarkable series of pledges this year to sharply change the recent , unsustainable greenhouse gas emission trends of the world 's biggest emitter .
In particular , Hu introduced a new goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP from 2005 levels by 2020 by a "" notable margin .
"" I think China needs to cut them by more than half over that 15 year period .
Julian Wong , a senior policy analyst for the Centre for American Progress , said : "" Taken together , President Hu 's latest message underscores China 's seriousness in tackling climate change , and narrows the gap between the asks and wants among the major developed and developing nations in the international negotiations .
This should serve as an indication to the developed countries of China 's good faith on climate action , and as a catalyst to other developing countries to formulate their own robust low - carbon strategies .
"" The world 's two biggest carbon polluters , the US and China , have come a long way over the last year .
And this should give the world genuine hope that serious progress can be made on the gravest threat humanity faces ."
2009-09-23,"Hu Jintao and Barack Obama got the main headlines from the UN climate change summit , but spare a moment for Nicolas Sarkozy .
Even on a day of high rhetoric , nobody quite matched Sarkozy 's intensity in chastising world leaders for failure to deal with the potential catastrophe that lies ahead .
"" We are on the road to failure , "" he said .
"" Time is not on our side . ""
So what 's his big idea to stop global warming , or in Sarkozy 's own words , "" transcend the role playing , the empty speeches , the petty diplomatic games "" that have deadlocked negotiations ?
Another summit , in November , just before the Copenhagen negotiations of the major developed countries that between them produce 80 % of the world 's emissions .
And the creation of a new international organisation to deal with climate change .
That will stop the speechifiers in their tracks .
And the creation of a new international environmental organisation — which presumably would get rid of the bureaucratic infighting .
Sarkozy such a new world body was needed to monitor any agreement that would come out of Copenhagen .
"" From the diplomats huddled within the shrine to modernist architecture that is the UN , there was little immediate enthusiasm for Sarkozy 's big idea .
But nobody was willing to publicly reject the notion either .
Denmark 's Lars Løkke Rasmussen , said simply : "" We have n't discussed the Sarkozy proposal in detail . ""
But it is now widely conceded that world leaders will need to apply themselves directly if there is going to be a meaningful agreement at Copenhagen .
The question is whether they will want to do it
Sarkozy 's way ."
2009-09-23,"This week 's summit on climate change at the United Nations in New York has given a strong boost to the negotiations over a major international treaty , but there remain a number of major obstacles that must be overcome before the crucial meeting in Copenhagen in December .
China , India and Japan , along with the private sector , all made positive and significant contributions at the summit .
Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , made specific commitments on curbing the growth in greenhouse gas emissions as China continues its extraordinary economic growth .
While the president promised a reduction by a "" notable margin "" rather than a specific figure , there is no doubt that the cut will be significant .
And the environment ministers of both China and India made important and constructive proposals for how their countries will reverse deforestation .
This was the kind of leadership I had hoped to see at the summit – organised by Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary general – with developing and emerging countries showing that they can tackle climate change while continuing their efforts to reduce poverty .
But we still have a long way to go before we can be sure that a strong agreement is in place for Copenhagen .
In the next couple of years , annual emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to reach a level of 50 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent .
If we are to have a reasonable chance of avoiding a rise in global average temperature by more than 2C , annual emissions have to be cut to no more than 20 gigatonnes by 2050 .
That means that the 9 billion people who will be living on the planet in 2050 must be producing , on average , no more than about two tonnes of greenhouse gases per year each .
At the moment , the rich industrialised countries of the European Union average about 10 - 12 tonnes per head of population , while the figure for the United States is almost 24 tonnes .
China , by contrast , emits about 6 tonnes per head at present .
Thus rich industrialised countries in particular must substantially reduce their emissions .
The developed countries must now demonstrate that they have the political will to reach a strong agreement in Copenhagen .
In New York , Japan 's new prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , outlined how his country will reduce its emissions by 25 % by 2020 , compared with 1990 .
This was a positive example that few others matched .
President Obama has already committed to a cut of 80 % in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , compared with 1990 .
But the American Clean Energy and Security Act passed by the House of Representatives sets an interim target for 2020 that is not considered ambitious enough by many other countries .
And it is not clear when , or even if , the Senate will pass a comparable act to reduce emissions .
It is these interim targets that should now be addressed by all countries during the coming weeks .
If we are to reach the goal of reducing emissions to 20 gigatonnes by 2050 , we must be at about 35 gigatonnes by the halfway point of 2030 .
That means global emissions have to peak within the next five years and be steadily falling by 2020 .
And while the commitments by the largest emitters already on the table for 2020 offer significant cuts relative to today 's emissions , they collectively fall 4 or 5 gigatonnes short of what is necessary if we are to be on a realistic trajectory to reach the 2030 and 2050 targets .
Developing countries should also sharply reduce their emissions – but they must be supported , financially and through technology sharing with the rich industrialised countries .
Without commitments to such support , the negotiations ahead will prove very difficult .
Although the political leaders must devise and implement the right policies to guide national and global emissions trajectories , it is the private sector that will be the main engine in the transition to a low - carbon global economy .
In that respect it was very encouraging that 181 investors , collectively responsible for the management of more than $ 13 trillion in assets globally , launched a statement in New York last week to support a global agreement on climate change .
The Leadership Forum for business leaders , which ran alongside the summit , also highlighted a tremendous variety of innovative ideas from within the private sector for the low - carbon transition .
So there are some reasons to be more optimistic about the prospects for securing a strong agreement in Copenhagen , following the New York summit .
But the obstacles that remain are very big and will require an even stronger effort to overcome , starting at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh and continuing during the coming round of treaty negotiations in Bangkok next week .
There must be real vision , leadership and creativity , as well as a mutual understanding of the difficulties of making and implementing domestic policies .
But if we can muster the effort , we can , as a world , forge a path towards a more prosperous and sustainable future – for us , our children , and generations to follow ."
2009-09-27,"The Copenhagen conference on climate change will most likely fail .
And two parties will bear the principal responsibility for its failure : the United States and India .
No one should be surprised by President Hu Jintao 's pledge to significantly reduce his country 's CO2 emissions .
Beijing 's dictatorship is keen to assuage international anxieties .
But Washington and New Delhi can not indulge international opinion at the expense of alienating their domestic constituencies .
President Obama simply can not afford to advocate further austerity to Americans reeling under a recession , and Jairam Ramesh , India 's pugnaciously articulate environment minister , wo n't be satisfied unless Obama does precisely that .
As Ramesh explained to an American interviewer on Tuesday : "" In the United States , emissions are lifestyle emissions .
For [ India ] , emissions are developmental emissions .
You 're asking [ India ] to compromise on development ...
You change your lifestyle and then we 'll think of compromising on development .
"" India 's argument resonates throughout the developing world .
From Brazil to Bangladesh , Obama 's sermon on shared responsibility strikes as an affront , akin to a burglar telling his victim to split the defence costs .
The voluptuaries of the west may advocate , without a hint of remorse or irony , that billions of people in India and China and Africa renounce material comforts and advancement which developed nations take for granted ; but developing nations seem to be firm in their conviction that , though climate change is a real threat , those who have contributed overwhelmingly to its causes – and continue to pollute the planet in the spirit of carpe diem – must also be the ones to devise and pay for solutions to curb it .
But India has a habit of invoking the injustices of the past to suppress the failures of present .
New Delhi repeatedly refers to the fact that , measured by per capita emissions , India ranks near the bottom of the list of worst polluters .
This may be true , but it is a disingenuous argument .
Per capita figures are meaningless ( and unjust ) because they are arrived at by apportioning the pollution that is principally produced in the urban centres , where wealth is concentrated , in equal measure to a billion individuals – an overwhelming majority of whom have been denied the dividends of pollution .
India is adducing its poor as the reason for its intransigent stand .
But its recent history is replete with instances of the state displacing the poor to create vacant lands for wealthy corporations – in effect socialising the costs of pollution while privatising its profits .
Unlike corporations , the planet belongs to everyone .
So concessions on emissions , if they can be worked out , must be linked to the equitable distribution of profits derived from pollution .
Working to prevent climate change will not be enough .
States must actively seek to establish contingency measures to deal with its consequences .
Bangladesh 's land mass is literally shrinking .
It is more than likely that India will have a colossal humanitarian crisis on its hands in the not too distant future , with Bangladeshis crossing the border into West Bengal on a scale that will make 1971 appear puny .
India can not turn them back , but it can not conceivably bear the cost of their absorption alone .
New Delhi should start pushing for a global fund from which it can draw later .
As a country that has lost more lives to climate change than any other , India also has a duty to make its rich – the beneficiaries of its emissions , the inhabitants of its mini - Americas – pay the costs .
Regardless of the results of the Copenhagen summit , India must stop playing the victim and take the lead in combatting climate change .
It has already made impressive strides , and the government has announced a series of ambitious plans to produce renewable energy and substantially reduce India 's dependence on fossil fuels .
According to the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi , solar thermal power plants can fulfil India 's energy needs .
Since sunlight is abundant , the "" potential is unlimited "" .
India could electrify not only itself but all of Asia and Africa .
In the process , it could help save humankind from extinction .
This would be a fitting tribute to its founder , Pandit Nehru , who at the turbulent time of its founding dedicated India to the "" larger cause of humanity "" ."
2009-10-06,"Barack Obama has been accused of "" kowtowing "" to China by refusing to meet the Dalai Lama on his trip to Washington this week .
In what is being seen as a sign of the growing economic and diplomatic clout of Beijing , Obama has agreed to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader only after the US president has visited his Chinese counterpart , Hu Jintao , in Beijing in November .
The apparent snub is a break with presidential tradition .
Each of the last three presidents has met the Dalai Lama whenever he has travelled to Washington .
He arrived in Washington yesterday , and will meet several other prominent politicians .
The White House says it can do more for the people of Tibet if its relations with China are good .
"" If the Tibet relationship is seen as an irritant to the US - China relationship , then that will cripple our ability to be of help , "" a senior official told the New York Times .
But Obama 's opponents accused the president of putting economic interest ahead of human rights concerns .
"" The US is kowtowing to Beijing again by refusing to meet with His Holiness , "" said Ileana Ros - Lehtinen , the top Republican on the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee .
Dana Rohrabacher , co - chairman of the Congressional Tibet Caucus , accused the White House of trying to "" placate Chinese tyrants "" .
The respected US political blog Politico quoted a former Federal Reserve official as saying economic concerns lay behind the decision . ""
Bottom line : do n't piss off your banker , "" the official reportedly said .
The Dalai Lama 's envoy , Lodi Gyari , played down talk of a snub .
He said the Dalai Lama had agreed to postpone his meeting with Obama after "" taking a broader and long - term perspective "" .
But privately , the Dalai Lama 's aides are understood to be frustrated by Obama 's decision .
Beijing usually objects strongly when the Dalai Lama travels away from his base in India .
It has accused him of using religion as a pretext for dangerous separatism .
The Chinese leadership was furious when George Bush awarded the Dalai Lama the congressional gold medal in 2007 .
It accused the US of "" interfering in the internal affairs of China "" ."
2009-10-16,"It sometimes seems as if the closer we get to Copenhagen , the further we get from a deal .
There were n't many signs of progress at the last three big gatherings on climate change .
Barack Obama disappointed at the United Nations by failing to press the Senate to move forward on climate change legislation , while Hu Jintao offered no specifics on how far China would go to reduce its future greenhouse gas emissions .
At the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh , the industrialised economies fell short of expectations they would produce a package on climate finance .
And climate talks in Bangkok this month ended in even deeper acrimony between the developing and developed economies .
But beneath the radar , there have been a few positive steps .
Norway , Indonesia , and — as of this week — Brazil have all come forward with new pledges on climate action .
The country 's environment minister , Carlos Minc , was quoted this week saying that Brazil would propose capping its greenhouse gas emissions at 2005 levels .
Meanwhile , the president , Lula Da Silva , said in a radio discussion that Brazil would take more aggressive measures to save the Amazon forest , aiming for an 80 % reduction in deforestation in 2020 .
"" We 're in the process of preparing our proposal for Copenhagen .
I foresee that by 2020 we will be able to reduce deforestation by 80 % , in other words we will emit some 4.8 billion fewer tonnes of carbon dioxide , "" the president said .
A formal announcement of Brazil 's new climate position is expected early next week .
It was the third country to come forward with a new proposal since late last month .
Indonesia 's president , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , told G20 leaders on September 25 that his government was working on a plan to cut emissions by 26 % in 2020 over business as usual projections .
In a copy of the speech obtained by AFP , the Indonesian leader said his country could cut emissions by as much as 41 % — provided it got international support .
He said the cuts would be achieved through increased investment in renewable energy , and curbing emissions from deforestation and other changes in land use .
Norway also stepped up , using the Bangkok talks to come forward with proposals to cut emissions by 30 % to 40 % , the most ambitious target of all developed countries .
Hilary McMahon , who works on climate policy at the World Resources Institute , says such individual pledges could become increasingly important .
The international negotiations are moving towards a bottom - up approach , with individual countries setting their own targets .
"" It really does help us to start doing the math and adding up how far this is going to get us , "" she said .
"" Unfortunately we are still looking like we are quite short . """
2009-11-13,"The leaders of the world 's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters – Barack Obama and Hu Jintao – are to meet on Tuesday in Beijing , in one of the most significant moments leading up to the world summit on climate change in Copenhagen next month .
Agreement between the US and China on key issues would breathe new life into the moribund negotiations towards a global climate deal .
But sources are downplaying the chances of a breakthrough , suggesting another blow to the talks .
Instead , modest progress may be announced in the fields of technology co - operation and private sector initiatives to move towards a low - carbon economy .
In the run - up to Copenhagen , the US negotiator Todd Stern had hoped for a series of bilateral steps that might lead the world 's major polluters into an international deal .
These two nations , which together account for 40 % of global emissions , will make or break the summit .
China is moving towards setting its first "" carbon intensity "" target , which would curb – but not cut – the pollution emitted as its economy grows .
The target is thought to be about a 40 - 45 % reduction relative to economic growth by 2020 .
But China is unlikely to declare its hand yet .
There remains a big gap in the demands made by each nation .
The US wants China to sign up to specific emissions commitments ; China insists they should be voluntary , as they are under the current Kyoto climate change treaty .
China 's public position is that rich nations should cut emissions by 40 % by 2020 .
Privately , negotiators acknowledge this is unrealistic , but they want the US to go much further than the 17 % cut approved by the House but blocked in the Senate .
If the US president says he is prepared to push for a higher target , some observers believe Hu may give him a political "" gift "" to take back . ""
China understands the political system in the US .
We know it 's difficult for Obama .
If he wants the Senate to do more , he needs to be able to say China will do more than people expect , "" said Yang Fuqiang , the director of global climate change solutions at the Worldwide Fund for Nature .
Yang identified several possible cards that China might play either during Obama 's visit or at Copenhagen .
Earlier this year , it withheld a planned announcement on a higher renewable energy target so that this could be used at a more politically opportune moment .
Other major shifts in its energy mix are the likely doubling or tripling of nuclear power generation , greater use of natural gas –
China has recently discovered some major fields inside its territory – and in the most optimistic scenario , a pledge to improve its energy or carbon efficiency by 20 % for each of its five - year plans until 2020 .
"" All these measure together add up to emissions reduction of 4 - 4.5 gigatonnes over the period 2005 to 2020 , "" said Yang .
"" This is the opportunity .
But the condition is that Obama uses the power of the presidency to persuade Congress to do more . ""
Others believe this is overly optimistic .
"" Obama 's dream scenario would be to come to China and make it look like he saves the world from China so that he could go back and convince his Congress to back him up in Copenhagen .
But why should China go along with that scenario .
The US target is pathetic , "" said another Chinese observer , who declined to be identified .
With dim prospects of a legally binding deal at Copenhagen or a US climate bill passing the Senate , others say Hu has little incentive to make concessions during Obama 's visit .
But the meeting itself will be significant .
"" There will be a lot of public stuff about cooperation and in private they will get to understand each other better .
It will be an opportunity to show that China is doing a lot .
That will help in the Senate , "" said Deborah Seligsohn , a principal advisor to the World Resources Institute 's Climate and Energy Programme in Beijing .
"" Fundamentally , the objective is for Obama and Hu to speak face to face .
Given that the specific issue is trust , that will help a lot . ""
China 's emissions have grown rapidly in recent years along with the economy , but it has one of the world 's most ambitious renewable energy programmes and is on course to meet a self - set target to improve energy efficiency by 20 % between 2005 and 2010 .
The world 's number one emitter is adamant that it should not have to take actions that restrict economic growth because rich nations have a far greater historical and per capita responsibility for the carbon in the atmosphere .
It wants wealthy countries like the US to provide technology and finance that will help developing nations to ease the impact of climate change and move towards a low - carbon economy .
The two governments signed a memorandum of understanding in July that identified possible areas of collaboration on research and technology .
But efforts to flesh out that agreement have proved tougher than expected .
There have been wrangles over how much each nation should pay for a proposed joint research centre on clean energy .
The US energy secretary , Steven Chu , who is travelling with Obama , is expected to sign an agreement next week , but it is unclear if the countries will split the costs down the middle .
While business deals and joint projects may be announced to develop green buildings , electric cars and smart power grids , there is less confidence that a deal can be struck in the key area of "" clean "" coal technology .
The US has proposed closer collaboration in this field , which is vital given the heavy reliance of both economies on coal .
But China has been cautious about such overtures , perhaps because it is poised to move ahead of the United States in several key processes , including integrated gasification combined cycle ( IGCC ) in power stattions and carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) .
If these two key players are unable to resolve their differences , there is a danger that the Copenhagen talks will suffer the same fate as the Kyoto protocol , which was handicapped by the absence of a clear commitment by China and rejection by the US Congress .
There is scope for more progress this time .
During the UN climate summit in September , Hu said China was prepared to reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by a "" notable margin "" by 2020 .
Beijing has a figure up its sleeve .
Government - related thinktanks are proposing targets of 40 - 45 % by 2020 and 78 - 80 % by 2050 .
"" I think they will announce something soon , "" said a source in the Energy Research Institute .
"" The upper end of our recommendation is 44 % .
But whether they will adopt it depends on their assessment of how fast the economy will grow .
"" Whether this figure will be high enough and announced early enough to shake the rust from the Senate is uncertain .
"" At some point , China must produce a number .
Assuming its good enough , then it should be recorded in an international agreement , "" said Charlie McElwee , a Shanghai - based American lawyer specialising in environmental issues .
"" Without that , I think there will be a pushback from the Senate . ""
For the moment , it is unclear even if the two leaders will attend Copenhagen .
Expectations have been pushed down so far recently that leaders appear reluctant to invest political capital in the talks .
Whether Obama 's charisma and Hu 's drive for "" scientific development "" can salvage at least a political agreement will be much clearer after next week ."
2009-11-16,"Barack Obama said the US and China will break new ground in their partnership on clean energy technology during a summit in Beijing tomorrow that will also seek to find a new way forward for global climate talks .
A day after backing a delay in the international negotiating process towards a deal in Copenhagen , the US president told a townhall meeting in Shanghai that he and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao would focus on ways to reduce their carbon footprints .
As the world 's two biggest emitters expand their economies and populations , he said they needed a way to minimise the impact of increased energy use .
"" Both countries have a great interest in finding new strategies to combat climate change , "" he said .
During the summit , the two nations will announce a new energy cooperation programme , unveil closer collaboration on "" cleaner coal "" technology and smart grids and establish a joint research centre .
Sources close to the preparations say a memorandum of understanding will be signed in the Great Hall of the People , under which the US Trade Development Agency will fund an office in Beijing to assist US firms to secure government financing for new energy projects .
A group of companies led by Peabody , one of the biggest US coal firms , will receive seed money from the US government money to establish a demonstration facility in China that shows off its scrubbing , washing and emission - reduction technology , the source says .
The firm may also unveil a deepening of its involvement in China 's GreenGen project to pioneer cleaner and more efficient coal burning technology .
General Electric will sign a deal with Shenhua , China 's biggest coal company , to use the former 's coal gasification technology for increased energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage .
But the message of cooperation between the world 's two biggest emitters looks likely to be diluted by the competitive instincts of businesses and politicians who are reluctant to share funding and technology with a rival .
US sources say no public money will be channelled to Chinese firms or projects because the country is seen as a rival .
At the start of his Asia tour , Obama highlighted this point by describing China as a "" vital partner , as well as a competitor . ""
The potential for friction has been evident in backroom negotiations over the funding of a joint clean energy research centre .
China is thought to have asked the US to provide a larger share of the costs to reflect its greater wealth and historical responsibility for the carbon in the atmosphere .
But the US wanted a 50 - 50 split .
The final amount of its investment in the new centre , which is expected to be unveiled by energy secretary Steven Chu tomorrow , will be in the region of $ 18 m , according to a source familiar with the deal .
US officials have recently been trying to link China 's Qinghua University , MIT in the US , and Cambridge in the UK .
The two nations also talk a different language when it comes to the transfer of technology from west to east , a key concern for China .
On Beijing 's wishlist are salt - resistant materials for offshore windfarms , hi - tech components for large wind turbines , smart - grid control systems and more efficient pumps for nuclear reactors .
But the US side prefers to talk in terms of "" technology cooperation "" , suggesting more of a two - way street .
Observers say far more could have been achieved with a smoother transition between the Bush and Obama administrations and a greater level of trust .
"" There are some areas where China is more advanced , but in key areas , it needs US technology , "" said Yang Fuqiang , head of climate solutions at the Worldwide Fund for Nature .
"" The difficulty is how to compensate the private sector and how to remove trade restrictions on items that the US does not want to give to China because of its fears a loss of competitive advantage . ""
Claims that China needs US technology are disputed .
"" There is nothing out there that China does not have access to if it is willing to pay for it .
This is more about money , "" said Charlie McElwee , a Shanghai - based American lawyer specialising in environmental issues .
"" On carbon capture and storage , China is among the world leaders if not the leader . ""
Business optimism about a potential low - carbon market worth $ 1 trillion in China has been tempered by concerns about trade tensions .
US solar panel manufacturers have accused Chinese rivals , such as Suntech , of dumping underpriced photovoltaic panels in the US .
Such concerns have slowed progress .
But industry insiders say tomorrow 's summit could smooth future collaboration ."
2009-11-17,"The US and China , the world 's two biggest polluters , today said they aimed to set targets for easing greenhouse gas emissions next month , potentially breathing new life into the flagging Copenhagen climate negotiations .
Days after the US president , Barack Obama , said time to secure a legally binding agreement had run out , he and the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , agreed at a summit that they would continue to press for a comprehensive deal at Copenhagen that would "" rally the world "" .
"" Our aim there , in support of what the prime minister [ Lars Løkke ]
Rasmussen of Denmark is trying to achieve , is not a partial accord or a political declaration , but rather an accord that covers all of the issues in the negotiations and one that has immediate operational effect , "" Obama said after holding talks with Hu in Beijing .
In a joint communique , the leaders said an accord in Denmark should include emission reduction targets for rich nations and a declaration of action plans to ease greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries .
Countering concerns that a non - legal deal could evade many key issues , the communique said the climate talks should also increase financial assistance to developing countries , promote technology development , help poor communities to adapt and enhance forest protection .
The two governments also signed agreements to co - operate in the field of low - carbon technology , including the establishment of a joint research centre and the promotion of "" cleaner coal "" power plants , green buildings and electric cars .
Hu said China and the US had agreed to expand co - operation on climate change , energy and the environment and to "" help produce positive outcomes out of the Copenhagen conference "" .
After weeks in which national leaders have been downplaying expectations for Copenhagen , environmental groups said today 's words from the US and China – which between them account for 40 % of the world 's emissions – had gone some way towards restoring ambitions for the summit .
They called for specific targets to be met , but said more political will was needed to ensure a successful outcome .
During wide - ranging talks with Hu , Obama raised differences over Tibet , human rights , trade and Iran .
While Hu made a pointed reference to trade disputes , the overall focus of the two leaders was on collaboration as they lauded increased co - operation between the countries on issues such as the economy and non - proliferation .
Today 's event had been described as a press conference , but no questions were allowed .
Instead , Hu and Obama delivered brief prepared comments on their discussions , which had lasted for two and a half hours .
Obama said the relationship between the US and China went "" far beyond any single issue "" , while Hu described the meeting as "" candid , constructive and very fruitful "" .
However , he added : "" I stressed to President Obama that , under current circumstances , our two countries need to oppose and reject protectionism in all its manifestations in an even stronger stand . ""
Obama said China 's partnership with the US had been critical to attempts to end the recession , but again stressed the importance of balanced economic growth and pointedly praised his hosts ' commitment "" to move towards a more market - oriented exchange rate over time "" .
China is angry about US steel pipe and tyre tariffs , and is also concerned that the US deficit could threaten its vast dollar holdings as the largest foreign lender to the country .
The US wants China to allow further appreciation of the renminbi in order to shift the huge trade imbalance .
Hu called on the US to respect China 's "" core interests "" – a reference to Taiwan and Tibet .
Obama said the US accepted that Tibet was part of China , but went on to call for the early resumption of talks between Beijing and the Dalai Lama .
He also said the governments would resume their on - off human rights dialogue early next year .
Obama told reporters he had spoken to his counterpart "" about Americans ' bedrock belief that all men and women possess certain fundamental human rights "" and stressed that these applied to "" religious and ethnic minorities "" .
The US president thanked Hu for Chinese support for non - proliferation and the elimination of North Korea 's nuclear programme , and the countries are focusing on restarting the collapsed six - party talks .
However , their differences on Iran were obvious , with Obama saying Tehran "" has an opportunity to present and demonstrate its peaceful intentions , but if it fails to take this opportunity , there will be consequences "" .
Hu said only that the issue should be resolved through negotiations .
Iran is a long - standing ally of China .
The Chinese leader will hold a state banquet in Obama 's honour tonight .

2009-11-18,"Barack Obama squeezed in a family hug between making deep bows before Japanese and Chinese leaders on his tour of Asia , his half - brother revealed today .
Soon after landing in Beijing and prior to dining with the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , the US president met Mark Ndesandjo , his brother on his father 's side , who lives in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen .
Ndesandjo flew to Beijing for the reunion and introduced Obama to his wife , who he said was the president 's biggest fan . ""
He came directly off the plane , changed some clothes and then came down and saw us , "" Ndesandjo said .
"" And he just gave me a big hug .
And it was so intense .
I 'm still over the moon on it . ""
In an interview with the Associated Press , Ndesandjo joked that his wife was "" still recovering "" , but gave few details about what had been discussed .
"" All I can say is , we talked about family , and it was very powerful because when he came in through that door , and I saw him and I hugged him , and he hugged me and hugged my wife , "" he said .
"" It was like we were continuing a conversation that had started many years ago . "" Obama told CNN : "" I do n't know him [ Ndesandjo ] well .
I met him for the first time a couple of years ago .
He stopped by with his wife for about five minutes during the trip . ""
The two men did not grow up together , but got to know each other as adults and last met during Obama 's election campaign .
Ndesandjo 's mother , Ruth Nidesand , was Barack Obama senior 's third wife .
Ndesandjo has lived in Shenzhen , a booming city , since 2001 , and works as a marketing consultant .
For most of that time , he has maintained a low profile , but he went public two weeks ago to launch a , semi - autobiographical novel .
In it , he reveals that his father beat him and his mother while they were living in Kenya .
He said he had chosen to write the novel because "" there are certain things you can do and you really should do because you know it will help people "" .
In an interview with CNN last week , Obama said : "" It 's no secret that my father was a troubled person ... he had an alcoholism problem and did n't treat his families very well . """
2009-12-31,"China has launched a crackdown on match - fixing and corruption in football with the arrests of more than 20 sports officials , including the president and two coaches of a team owned by Sheffield United .
Zhang Weizhe , the coach of its Hong Kong - based offshoot , and two other men linked to the Yorkshire club are suspected of buying promotion , bribing referees and using club funds for private business .
The three men were arrested in a crackdown on one of the world 's most scandal - plagued leagues after China 's president , Hu Jintao , called for a clean - up .
So far 22 people , including a chairman , managers , players and officials have been caught in the dragnet , which has confirmed many of the worst fears of supporters at the state of a sport in China that is notorious for "" black whistles "" – the local term for rigged games .
Sheffield United are not implicated in any wrongdoing , but the English Championship club may be forced to reconsider their investment in Chinese football .
In 2006 , they became the first foreign club to buy a Chinese team –subsequently renamed the Chengdu Blades – which is now another high - profile subject of the police investigation .
The Chengdu president , Tony Xu – an entrepreneur who studied for his MBA at Sheffield University – was detained last month .
He and his deputy , You Kewei , are accused of bribing a Qingdao club official in 2007 to fix a match that helped their team get promoted to the top flight .
According to prosecutors , they fixed the season 's deciding game by paying the opposition 300,000 yuan ( £ 27,000 ) and promising to invest 200,000 yuan in training facilities and a players ' dormitory .
Xu is a charismatic wheeler - dealer whose love of football and command of English helped him to build strong UK links .
He played a central role in the 2005 transfer of Hao Haidong – who had 100 caps for China – to Sheffield United for £ 1 , then the record low fee .
He reportedly also helped to arrange the ill - fated transfer of Paul Gascoigne to Gansu Tianmu in 2003 .
Former associates say Xu 's downfall may have been a tendency to mix club affairs with his own business .
Li Chengpeng , the author of an exposé of football corruption in China , said Xu used club funds , mostly those provided by Sheffield United , to buy 4 hectares ( 10 acres ) of land for development .
A local government official granted the purchase on condition that Chengdu won promotion , Li said .
"" Buying victory is very common .
Xu is by no means the worst offender , "" said Li .
"" He is popular .
He lived a simple life .
He really did help to give Sichuan a decent team and facilities for the first time . ""
Li expressed concern that the arrests might undermine confidence in Chinese football . ""
Many people are worried that this incident will cause people in the UK to think Chinese football ca nt be trusted any more .
I hope that 's not the case .
Chinese football is eager for direction and management from UK , "" he said .
A representative of Sheffield United said the English club were aware of the situation , but had no comment .
Football 's endemic corruption in China is no secret .
Nan Yong , the vice - president of the Chinese Football Association , has described match - fixing as a cancer that needs to be removed .
Many of the problems are related to gambling .
Although betting on matches is illegal , online bookies – many of them run by UK firms on overseas servers – do billions of dollars of business every year .
Chinese gambling cartels have gone to extraordinary lengths to fix games , including buying second and third division clubs in Finland , Belgium and eastern Europe and then replacing the manager and best players to ensure they lose heavily .
Buying a game in China is far easier because the salaries of all but a handful of star players and referees are so low .
When John Hollins joined Shenyang Tiger Star from Stockport in 2004 , he found the players living in the changing room and almost too undernourished to train properly .
The combination of corruption and inequality have made the national team – which has qualified for the World Cup finals just once despite the planet 's biggest potential pool of players – into a laughing stock .
While million of Chinese fans love European football , they are scornful of their own league .
This was evident during the Beijing Olympics , where Chinese fans at the semi - final chanted for the resignation of the chairman of the football association .

2010-04-01,"A thaw in relations between the US and China appears to be under way after months of strain between the superpowers over arms sales to Taiwan , cybersecurity , the Dalai Lama and the trade imbalance .
The Chinese foreign ministry said today that President Hu Jintao is to visit Washington on 12 - 13 April for a nuclear proliferation summit .
The decision came less than 24 hours after it emerged that China , after months of stalling , had agreed to engage in negotiations on drafting UN sanctions against Iran .
The visit by Hu was regarded as a litmus test for the state of relations by Washington , which feared he might boycott the summit in protest over arms sales to Taiwan and other causes of tension .
The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , Qin Gang , hinted at a thaw today when he told reporters : "" I 'd like to reiterate that the undue disruption which China - US relations endured not long ago is in the interest of neither country and is not what we would like to see . "" Obama had kind words , too , for China when he met the Chinese ambassador to the US this week , and which were reported by the Chinese media as reflecting a positive change on the part of Washington .
A White House spokesman , Bill Burton , welcomed Hu 's attendance : "" We have an important relationship with China , one in which there are many issues of mutual concern that we work on together .
But there also will be times where we disagree .
I think this proves the point that despite those disagreements , we can work together on issues like nuclear proliferation . ""
But there are potential problems looming , the biggest of which is whether the US treasury will cite China for manipulating its currency in its annual report on 15 April , days after Hu 's visit .
Asked if the visit would influence the treasury 's decision whether to cite China for currency manipulation , Burton referred questions to the treasury .
Analysts in Washington said today that China may have secured a promise from the US that it would not be cited as a quid pro quo for attending the summit and the deal on Iran .
The apparent thaw marks another success for Obama , who has seen his fortunes improve on the domestic and foreign policy fronts since winning the protracted struggle to secure health reform in the US .
Kenneth Lieberthal , a China specialist at the Washington - based Brookings Institution and a former special adviser on Asia in the Clinton White House , said the rough patch looked to be over .
"" I have been expecting an uptick in relations and I think that is what we are seeing .
I would give Obama credit , "" he said .
He saw the move on Iran as a positive step , showing that China was prepared to engage in serious negotiations .
"" They are making it clear they are now in the game , "" he said .
"" They are very concerned about proliferation in the Middle East .
The question is what they are going to do about it . ""
As well as the visit in less than a fortnight , discussions are under way between Beijing and Washington about a state visit to the US by Hu , possibly in June .
Obama , the most Pacific - orientated president yet , regards US relations with China as having the potential to define the 21st century , and reached out to Beijing last year , bringing accusations from Republicans that he was being too soft .
Beijing tested Obama for weakness earlier this year , complaining more vociferously than normal about US arms sales to Taiwan and over the visit to the White House by the Dalai Lama .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , embarrassed Beijing with a speech opposing Chinese internet censorship , an issue highlighted last week by Google 's decision to in effect shut down its mainland China operation .
The US , Britain , France and Germany have been trying since late last year to put together a package of sanctions against Iran , which they claim is intent on securing a nuclear weapons capability .
But China , which has economic ties to Tehran , has proved reluctant to take punitive action .
The shift took place during a telephone conference between the five countries , plus Russia , on Tuesday .
Susan Rice , the US ambassador to the UN , told CNN : "" China has agreed to sit down and begin serious negotiations here in New York … as a first step toward getting the entire UN security council on board with a tough sanctions regime against Iran . ""
But Qin today refused to confirm the move , saying only that "" all parties agreed to continue to maintain contact through various channels "" .
Shi Yinhong , professor of international relations and director of the centre on American studies at Renmin University of China , said Beijing had made two major concessions to the US . ""
This proves that the perception in the west that China is pursuing an aggressive foreign policy is wrong , "" he said .
"" China 's leaders are willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt as they respect him , but whether Obama will reciprocate we have to wait and see . ""
Victor Gao , director of the China National Association of International Studies , said : "" When Obama met the new Chinese ambassador to Washington , Zhang Yesui , this week he made remarks that made China more comfortable and they have put the US - China relationship back on track …
but we are not out of the woods yet .
If Congress takes protectionist action that stalls China 's economy , it will be devastating not just for China , but for America and the rest of the world . """
2010-04-18,"China 's president , Hu Jintao , today flew into the western town devastated by an earthquake , pledging swift rebuilding in the predominantly Tibetan area , as the death toll climbed to 1,700 .
Chinese state television showed him cradling an injured young Tibetan survivor and assuring her : "" You will have a bright future .
Grandpa will be thinking of you . ""
Hu cut short an official trip to South America because of the disaster in Yushu county , Qinghai province .
State news agency
Xinhua reported today that 1,706 people have died , with 256 still missing and 12,128 injured .
It also said that a 68-year - old man had been pulled alive from rubble in the town of Jiegu this morning after 100 hours .
Professor Robert Barnett , an expert on Tibetan issues at Columbia University in New York , said the government 's brisk handling of the disaster was striking .
He added : "" It 's certainly interpreted cynically by Tibetan intellectuals and those on the internet ... on the ground it might be very different . ""
Although Yushu was not one of the Tibetan areas of Qinghai which saw unrest in 2008 , there have been some signs of underlying tensions since Wednesday 's quake .
Many blamed Chinese mining for causing the disaster , while some monks complained they had not been given sufficient credit for their rescue work .
But Barnett noted : "" Yushu is almost the only area [ in the Tibetan plateau ] where local officials do have a pretty good relationship with their community . ""
He said that authorities did not appear to have encouraged non - Tibetan immigration , often a source of rancour , and had allowed Tibetan non - government organisations dealing with environment and community issues to emerge .
"" People are on a leash , but it 's a much longer leash and they appreciate that . ""
He said the mobilisation of the monks – who have played a major role in rescue and relief work – was unprecedented .
"" It 's not a disparate emotional response but an incredibly organised one , "" he said .
Despite the efforts of both officials and monks , many survivors are still struggling in the sub - zero overnight temperatures .
Zou Ming , head of disaster relief at the ministry of civil affairs , told a news conference in Beijing : "" At the moment the supplies that have been sent are enough to ensure people there have shelter , food and water .
Of course , there are shortages , and a lot of supplies are still in transit . ""
Hundreds of lorries carrying everything from earthmoving equipment and generators to plastic piping and instant noodles have been making the 560 mile journey from the provincial capital of Xining to the remote disaster zone , along with lengthy army convoys .
Aman Yee , deputy manager of Oxfam 's China unit and part of a team handing out thousands of blankets in Yushu , said : "" There is quite a lot of material but there are problems distributing it to the people who need it most . ""
One local resident , Dongzhu , told Reuters : "" Our first problem is that there are n't enough tents , and too many of the ones that are arriving are going to people with influence . ""
He said speedy reconstruction was essential before the bitter winter arrives and added there was "" absolutely no way "" inhabitants could pay for it themselves .
Qinghai is one of the poorest parts of China .
The Dalai Lama said he would like to visit the quake zone to offer survivors comfort .
It is highly unlikely Beijing would allow the exiled spiritual leader to return to China for the first time since he fled Tibet in 1959 , after a failed uprising against Chinese rule ."
2010-04-30,"After eight years preparing , Shanghai is launching the biggest Expo so far with a lavish show of lights and fireworks .
Hu Jintao , China 's president , is hosting leaders including the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , and the European commission president , José Manuel Barroso , amid intense security in the eastern Chinese city .
The South Korean president , Lee Myung - bak , and North Korea 's top official , Kim Yong - nam , are also attending .
Almost 200 countries are participating in the multibillion - pound Expo , which opens its doors to the public today .
An estimated 70 million people – mainly Chinese – are expected to visit in the next six months .
The Shanghai Expo 2010 features everything from palm trees from Saudi Arabia to Rodin sculptures from France – perhaps a bid by Paris to rival Denmark , which has brought its Little Mermaid statue from Copenhagen harbour .
Tourists will ride up to the roof of Switzerland 's pavilion on a chairlift , while the Netherlands ' "" Happy Street "" has miniature buildings set on what appears to be a helter - skelter .
The British pavilion – a cube pierced with 7-metre ( 23 ft ) Perspex spikes – proved so popular at trial openings that at one stage it had to be closed when too many people rushed to see it . ""
Shanghai 's hosting of the World Expo is the pride of all Chinese people , "" Hu told a delegation from Taiwan , according to China 's state media .
Earlier he described the event as "" yet another important international gathering following the 2008 Beijing Olympic games "" .
Celebrities expected to perform at the opening include actor Jackie Chan – ubiquitous at big Chinese events – as well as pianist Lang Lang and tenor Andrea Bocelli , who also sang at the opening for the Beijing Olympics .
The tradition of Expos and World Fairs began with Great Exhibition of 1851 in London , but has lost much of its lustre in recent years .
China is hoping to breathe new life into it .
It is spending $ 4.2bn ( £ 2.7bn ) to host the Expo .
A reported $ 45bn has been spent overhauling Shanghai for the event – more than Beijing spent for the Olympics – with new airport terminals , hundreds of miles of subway line and a revamp of its historic waterfront , the Bund .
With security precautions at their height tonight , thousands of police are on duty , guards have been stationed at thousands of bus stops and 8,000 firefighters are on alert .
But campaigners say the event has also brought a crackdown on dissent .
The Chinese Human Rights Defenders ( CHRD ) network said officials have detained , harassed or placed under surveillance activists , intellectuals and petitioners across Shanghai and surrounding areas .
One target has been those who have protested over the forced demolition of their homes to make way for the Expo site .
According to official estimates , 18,000 households have been knocked down .
In a statement the CHRD urged : "" The government must stop the practice of placing ' troublemaking ' individuals under surveillance and restricting their movements on ' sensitive ' occasions .
These individuals should not be punished for exercising their freedom of expression or their right to defend human rights .
""
Similar pressure was put on activists ahead of the Olympics .
Last month 6,000 people were detained in Shanghai in what officials described as a drive against "" theft , gambling , prostitution and selling pornographic materials "" .
In the runup to the event officials have also cleared many vendors off the streets and even ordered residents not to wear their pyjamas outside their homes , as some have become used to doing .
The Expo site , which spans both banks of the Huangpu river , is more than twice the size of Monaco at 5.3 sq km ( 1,310 acres ) .
Shanghai residents have begun thronging areas nearby in the hope of catching the best of the fireworks display ."
2010-10-15,"President Hu Jintao would like his time since 2002 to be remembered as one of "" harmony "" , the buzzword of the last decade .
With a big meeting on in Beijing , with sharp debate about the future direction of the party and of China , "" disharmony "" now prevails .
This is not how things were meant to be .
Hu is a consensus builder , and a control freak .
He never gives one - to - one interviews to western journalists .
His minders ensure the world runs to a tight timetable .
But the Nobel award to Liu Xiaobo is only one of several recent irruptions into this orderly world .
China is a victim of its own success .
When it entered the World Trade Organisation in late 2001 not even the most optimistic would have expected that within 10 years it would be the world 's second largest economy , largest exporter and largest holder of foreign reserves .
It has left the elite , at the top of which sits Hu , in a place they thought they would not get to for as much as another 10 years .
Hu talks constantly of the party 's legitimacy being built on its economic performance .
But his premier , Wen Jiabao , has been alluding openly to how much more pressing political reforms will now become .
China is well on its way to becoming a middle - income country .
Like any other society in this transitional phase , all sorts of things start happening .
Demands for stronger rule of law , a greater role for civil society , devolution of powers from central to local government , and more participation in decision - making are coming thick and fast .
Dealing with the economy was the easy bit .
Now things become far more complex .
China is in ferment .
Some 12 m petitions to the central government were made from 2005 to 2009 .
The courts are often clogged with civil cases .
As much is spent on internal security as on international defence .
That the government felt so insecure it had to imprison Liu Xiaobo for 11 years is symptomatic of the contradictions .
The real worry is that the party elite lack the vision , the experience and the will to start dealing with reform .
Like many other systems , that of the Chinese faces pressure to modernise far faster than they ever expected .
The past weeks should alert people inside and outside China to the fact that this will not be an easy process .
With a leadership change due in 2012 , it is not only the issues which are confusing , but also the question of who will deal with them .
The signs are clear .
Hu 's "" harmonious "" era is coming to a close ."
2010-10-18,"Chinese politicians have appointed the vice - president , Xi Jinping , to a key military position , state media reported today , reinforcing expectations that he will become the country 's next leader .
Xi has long been expected to take over when Hu Jintao steps down as party general secretary in 2012 and as president the following year .
The state news agency Xinhua announced that Xi had become a vice - chairman of the central military commission , which oversees the People 's Liberation Army , after a four - day meeting of the party 's central committee .
Xi , 57 , is a "" princeling "" , the son of a party veteran , Xi Zhongxun , who was an ally of Deng Xiaoping and helped to oversee the economic opening process in southern China .
Xi Jinping was sent to the countryside as an educated youth during the cultural revolution and later studied chemical engineering at the prestigious Tsinghua University , going on to gain a law doctorate .
He was party secretary of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces before taking the top job in Shanghai when Chen Liangyu was brought down by a corruption case .
Months later Xi joined the party 's standing committee and took responsibility for the Olympics .
It was around that time that Henry Paulson , the then US treasury secretary , described him as "" the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line "" .
Xi 's wife , Peng Liyuan , is a popular folk singer .
In an official magazine she described him as frugal , hard - working and down - to - earth .
Overseas , Xi may be best known for remarks that were never reported by China 's state media .
On a foreign trip last spring , he told his audience : "" There are some well - fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than point fingers at our affairs .
China does not , first , export revolution ; second , export poverty and hunger ; third , cause troubles for you .
What else is there to say ? ""
Ni Lexiong , a professor at Shanghai 's University of Political Science and Law , told Associated Press : "" Barring anything unexpected , Xi will be taking over as party leader "" .
Russell Leigh Moses , a Beijing - based political analyst , said : "" Two years is still a lifetime in Chinese politics .
While this is a step forward for him and the stability of the party , no one knows what lies ahead in terms of the final selection process .
"" We do n't know if Hu Jintao will follow Jiang Zemin 's model and decide to remain as chairman of the central military commission for some time [ after stepping down as general secretary and president ] . ""
Joseph Cheng , head of the Contemporary China Research Centre at the City University of Hong Kong , told the Associated Press Xi 's rise reflected the party 's determination to see balance and consensus . ""
Hu may have other preferences , but rocking the boat and changing the plan is too risky and the cost too high , "" he said .
Some had expected Xi to take the post last year , largely because Hu was appointed to the commission three years before taking over .
Moses said analysts would be watching for a clearer articulation of Xi 's views after today 's announcement , particularly with regard to the armed forces .
"" We are not sure exactly what Xi stands for or against … his own policy preferences remain quite unclear , "" he said .
"" We really have a much clearer sense of Li Keqiang 's views ; he is quite loquacious .
Xi prefers not to have a high public profile . ""
Many expect Li to take over from Wen Jiabao as premier in 2012 .
The annual plenum also discussed the country 's next five - year plan , which will begin in 2011 .
As expected , the communique from the meeting suggested the plan would aim to strengthen the embryonic welfare system and promote equality .
Analysts will be watching keenly for more details of what happened at the plenum , in light of Wen 's recent calls for political reform recently .
It is unclear precisely what the premier has in mind , but his comments are highly unusual for a Chinese leader and most Chinese media did not report them .
The meeting communique said party leaders had pledged "" vigorous yet steady "" efforts to promote political restructuring , Xinhua reported .
Administrative changes are routine within the party .
ENDS"
2010-11-07,"David Cameron was accused last night of sending the wrong signals on climate change to China , the world 's biggest polluter , as he prepared to lead the largest - ever official UK delegation to the country .
He will be accompanied by George Osborne , the chancellor , business secretary Vince Cable , the climate and energy secretary , Chris Huhne , and Michael Gove , the education minister , as well as more than 50 business leaders on the two - day visit starting on Tuesday .
Efforts to boost bilateral trade , and concerns over human rights , are expected to head the agenda in talks with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao .
China is the UK 's second - biggest trade partner after the EU .
But last night Labour claimed that carefully constructed efforts to bind the Chinese into international efforts to invest in low - carbon technology and improve energy security were being undermined by government cuts .
Shadow foreign secretary Yvette Cooper said William Hague , the foreign secretary , was giving the wrong message by slashing a £ 14.4 m fund set up in 2008 to provide expertise to China and other countries on low - carbon technology and to help them to move away from coal - based technology .
Funding was cut by £ 3 m in the summer for the Low Carbon High Growth Fund and it is believed to be under further threat after the spending review .
Hague has said he would examine other ways to finance the fund .
Cooper said there was now a danger of international momentum being lost ahead of the UN climate change summit in Cancún starting later this month .
The biggest success of the FCO fund was the designation of Jilin City in the north - east of China as the first pilot for a "" low carbon zone "" .
"" Putting less emphasis on climate change in foreign policy is a big strategic mistake .
We wo n't ever solve climate change in one country ; it has to be a global effort , "" Cooper said .
The visit will see Cameron having to walk diplomatic tightropes on several issues .
His judgment on foreign affairs was called into question before the general election when he appeared to lump China together with Iran in a television debate , saying Britain should retain its independent nuclear deterrent because "" we do n't know what is going to happen with Iran [ and ] we ca n't be certain of the future in China "" .
Chinese officials will not want Cameron to raise human rights ; but they are realistic , and know he will do so .
He is expected to discuss the case of Liu Xiaobo , the Nobel peace prize winner serving 11 years for co - authoring a call for democratic reforms .
A tough public condemnation of Liu 's imprisonment , especially if delivered alongside a Chinese minister , would enrage Beijing .
Since Liu was awarded the prize for his non - violent calls for political reform , the Chinese authorities have put scores of political dissidents and human rights activists in jail or under house arrest .
Artist Ai Weiwei , who helped to design the Bird 's Nest stadium for the 2008 Olympics , has been placed under house arrest after planning a party at his Shanghai studio to draw attention to government efforts to demolish the building .
The party became a focus of attention for dissidents across the country .
A Downing Street spokesman refused to say which cases the prime minister would want to discuss .
Sir George Young , the leader of the Commons , told MPs last week : "" The prime minister will raise the serious issue about the human rights record of China .
That issue will not go by default . ""
A survey by the British Chamber of Commerce in China to coincide with the visit shows businesses broadly confident of increasing trade with the country – 36 % of respondents expect demand for their products and services to increase significantly while 44 % expect a more modest increase .
And 25 % of respondents saw their performance in China as in line with that in other markets , while 30 % saw it as above average and 21 % as significantly above average ."
2010-11-11,"Talks between world leaders on ending the growing tensions over global trade and currencies were in the balance today as the G20 summit in Korea entered its crucial final phase .
Talks were held earlier today between US president Barack Obama and Chinese president Hu Jintao to head off criticism that both countries were pursuing policies that could trigger a "" race to the bottom "" , harming global trade and delaying recovery from the worst financial crisis since the second world war .
But the outcome of the talks was in doubt as G20 officials drafted the final communique .
Significant concessions were unlikely , according to sources close to the discussions .
One said the G20 was in a "" less heroic phase "" and an over - arching deal was unlikely .
China and the US were at loggerheads before the summit over plans by the Federal Reserve to spend $ 600bn on treasury bonds to boost the ailing US economy .
One of the side effects of the move is to drive down the value of the US dollar .
China was angered by the move because it will attract "" hot "" capital inflows to developing countries and make them less competitive .
The Beijing leadership criticised the Obama administration as pursuing policies harmful to free trade and today stepped up the attacks .
Zhang Tao , director of the international department of People 's Bank of China , said that Washington "" should not force others to take medicine for its own disease "" , warning that disorderly capital inflows resulting from the Fed 's action could hurt emerging markets .
He said : "" As emerging countries are important for the global economic recovery , that will greatly increase the downward risks in the world economy . ""
Before his talks with Hu , whom he has now met seven times in two years , Obama said : "" As two of the world 's leading economies we have a special obligation to deal with ensuring strong balance and sustained growth . ""
"" The US – China relationship , I think , has become stronger over the last several years , as we 've been discussing a whole range of not only bilateral issues but world issues , "" he said .
Other countries , including Germany , have rounded on the two powerhouse economies for adding to trade imbalances .
In behind - the - scenes discussions countries such South Korea are understood to have taken the Chinese to task for insisting on tracking the dollar on its downward path .
David Cameron had earlier urged the G20 summit to avoid a currency war that could harm global growth .
Cameron said it was important for leaders at the G20 summit in the Korean capital to address the growing threat from competitive currency devaluations and use global financial institutions to monitor developments .
Addressing a business leaders ' conference at the G20 summit , Cameron said rebalancing trade was a priority to win the battle for sustainable growth and prevent another financial crisis .
"" We 're going to have to make a big argument that trade is good for everybody .
We need to deal with this idea that export success for one country is a disaster for other countries .
Trade is n't a zero - sum game , "" he said .
He pointed to a report by the International Monetary Fund showing how trade surpluses were being stockpiled in some countries – such as China and Germany – while deficits grew ever bigger in others , such as the US .
Cameron said : "" The issue is this : One of the problems that lay behind the 2008 crisis was the fact that we had a wall of saving in the east and a wall of debt in the west .
This massive surplus of cash seeking out places to invest led to the problems , "" he said .
"" According to the IMF , those imbalances are currently getting worse , not better .
We must n't fail to address this issue . ""
Cameron said he was concerned that complaints about a lack of free trade would trigger a wave of protectionism , taking the world economy back to the 1930s .
He said moves should be in the opposite direction , and it was an embarrassment that the Doha free trade agreement had been left unratified . ""
One of the main purposes of this G20 should be to show we 're going to fight protectionism in all its forms .
We 're going to fight trade barriers , we 're going to fight beggar - my - neighbour policies .
We 're going to fight currency wars .
"" We 're going to fight competitive devaluations .
We 're going to show that this world , these politicians , these leaders , have learned the lessons of the 1930s .
We 're going to keep the system open rather than see it progressively close , "" he said .
However , Cameron maintained his government was determined to cut the UK 's deficit , despite concerns that global growth remained fragile and it was important to prioritise growth over deficit reduction .
President Obama said he expected the final communique — which will follow substantive talks on trade , to emphasise the need for policies to encourage growth .
Cameron said : "" We absolutely have to deal with [ the deficit ] .
The alternative is n't some wonderland of continuous growth , the alternative is the markets questioning your economy , it 's your interest rates rising , it 's confidence falling and you see your economy go into the danger zone that others are in , "" he said .
"" Some countries , those with big deficits , need to deal with those deficits .
That is not against global growth , that is helping to promote global growth . ""
Robert Zoellick , head of the World Bank , said growth was a priority .
Before the summit he said it was the natural order of things for countries with growing economies to experience inflows of capital and rising currencies .
He urged G20 nations to devote their energies to sweeping away trade barriers to promote growth .
As if to emphasis the difficulties faced by countries pursuing free trade agreements , president Obama and South Korea 's Lee Myung - bak admitted talks to sign a bilateral free trade agreement had foundered .
They said negotiators would continue talks to address US concerns that the deal did not do enough to open South Korean markets to US beef and cars .
"" We agreed that more time is needed to resolve detailed issues and asked trade ministers to reach a mutually acceptable deal as soon as possible , "" Lee said ."

Summary ------- 1 .
( C ) Liaoning Party Secretary Li Keqiang , a front runner for elevation to the Politburo this fall and potential successor to President Hu Jintao in 2012 , described the challenges he faces as a provincial leader to the Ambassador over dinner on March 12 .
Engaging and well - informed , Li related that despite brisk economic growth , Liaoning 's income gaps remain severe .
To create a "" harmonious society , "" he has tried to guarantee minimum living standards by providing new housing to the destitute and a job to every household .
The public is dissatisfied with education , health care and housing , but it is corruption that truly incenses them .
On foreign policy , Li said United States - China relations are developing smoothly , welcoming bilateral cooperation on North Korea .
Turning to trade relations , Li claimed that China is boosting imports , domestic consumption and social safety nets both to balance trade and further its own development .
Concerned by protectionist sentiment in the United States and what he described as a lack of understanding about China in Congress , Li passionately argued in defense of free trade and said more Members of Congress should visit the PRC .
Regarding China 's ongoing National People 's Congress session , Li judged that passage of the draft property law and promoting programs to address social issues are most important .
End Summary .
NPC :
Focus on Property Law , Social Issues
------------------------------------------ 2 .
( C ) Liaoning Party Secretary Li Keqiang , identified as a potential "" fifth generation "" leader and possible successor to President Hu Jintao , joined the Ambassador for dinner at his residence on March 12 .
In town for the ongoing National People 's Congress ( NPC ) session , Li judged the draft property law and social issues to be the most important subjects for the Liaoning delegation .
The property law , which will impact the foundation of China 's economic system , demonstrates just how far China has come in 30 years of reform .
Most Deputies believe the bill 's passage is "" assured , "" given the nearly unanimous support it received from the NPC Standing Committee just prior to the opening of this year 's legislative session .
Liaoning is also focused on Premier Wen Jiabao 's commitment to deal with social issues , particularly those designed to raise living standards and better the people 's livelihood .
The Economy : Not
By the Numbers ------------------------------- 3 .
( C ) Describing some of the challenges he faces as Party Secretary , Li related that despite brisk economic growth of SIPDIS 12.8 percent in 2006 , Liaoning 's income gaps remain severe .
Liaoning ranks among the top 10 Chinese provinces in terms of per capita GDP , yet the number of its urban residents on welfare is among the highest in the country and average urban disposable income is below the national average .
By contrast , rural disposable incomes are above the national average .
Even so , incomes for Liaoning farmers are only half that of urban residents .
4 .
( C ) GDP figures are "" man - made "" and therefore unreliable , Li said .
When evaluating Liaoning 's economy , he focuses on three figures : 1 ) electricity consumption , which was up 10 percent in Liaoning last year ; 2 ) volume of rail cargo , which is fairly accurate because fees are charged for each unit of weight ; and 3 ) amount of loans disbursed , which also tends to be accurate given the interest fees charged .
By looking at these three figures , Li said he can measure with relative accuracy the speed of economic growth .
All other figures , especially GDP statistics , are "" for reference only , "" he said smiling .
Harmonious Society Means Jobs
----------------------------- 5 .
( C )
In an attempt to create a "" harmonious society "" in Liaoning , Li said he has tried to guarantee a minimum standard of living for all residents .
For example , the province moved over 1.2 million urban slum dwellers into new , heavily government - subsidized apartments over the past two years .
Premier Wen visited Liaoning during this past Chinese New Year Holiday to inspect this program .
Although the new apartments provide only 40 to 50 square meters to each family , they are far superior to the slums in which residents previously lived .
The Central Government provided a great BEIJING 00001760 002 OF 004 deal of support for this program , with local governments and government - backed loans providing the most of the funding .
In exchange for a modest amount of money , residents receive the deed to their new homes at a small fraction of the market rate .
Li said he also guaranteed that every Liaoning household would have at least one member with a job .
In 2005 , there were 240,000 provincial households in which not a single family member had work .
Today there are none , he proudly declared .
Li 's standing promise is that his government will find a job for every "" unemployed household "" within 20 days of notification .
Governance : Corruption , Public Feedback
----------------------------------------
6 .
( C )
Although Liaoning residents are dissatisfied with education , health care and housing issues , it is corruption that makes them most angry , Li told the Ambassador .
The most effective way to combat official graft is to create a transparent system of rules and adequate supervision that leaves corrupt officials no room to act .
This is the method Liaoning employed to manage the vast sums spent on its massive slum relocation project .
Once a corrupt official is discovered , he is promptly punished , which provides a good lesson to bureaucrats taking up new posts .
The province has also increased efforts to "" strictly educate "" public officials , Li said .
Part of this education involves prison tours that force bureaucrats to visit incarcerated officials convicted of graft in order to witness first hand the consequences of malfeasance .
7 .
( C )
To learn what is on the minds of the public , Li said he uses a variety of channels , official and unofficial .
These include investigative reports , Li 's own inspection tours of grassroots areas , media reporting and letters addressed directly to him .
Sometimes , Li uses friends who are not from Liaoning to gather information about the province that he can not obtain himself .
Finally , there are the "" official "" channels of the Provincial People 's Congress and Political Consultative Conference .
Arguing that these official channels are "" highly consultative , "" Li warned against assuming that People 's Congress deliberations are rigged .
Although every bill is usually passed with an incredibly high number of "" yes "" votes , he asserted that people do n't see the behind - the - scenes reviews and feedback sessions that result in the original drafts of bills being altered substantially before passage .
Rule of Law
----------- 8 .
( C ) China has made great progress in improving its legal system and implementing the rule of law , said Li , who has a degree in law .
On the other hand , given that the rule of law has a short history in China , the country still has a long way to go in "" perfecting "" its legal system .
The concept of ruling the country according to law is increasingly becoming rooted in the minds of the people , and there is a recognition that relying on the law allows the government to do its work better and more efficiently .
At the same time , the government must cope with the challenges of implementing and following the laws passed by the people 's congresses .
Education ---------
9 .
( C ) Education is crucial for China 's continued development , Li said .
The most important task is to increase access to compulsory education .
Although all Chinese children are supposed to receive at least nine years of schooling , many do not .
Even nine years of education is insufficient , Li said , hoping that in the long term this could be extended to 10 or 12 years .
This year 's NPC Government Work Report contains two key measures on education .
The first provides government subsidies covering tuition for poor students , especially in rural areas .
The second gives totally free schooling to those students majoring in education .
Referring to Deng Xiaoping 's appeal to make Chinese education open to the world , to modernization and to the future , Li said he believes China has already succeeded in doing so .
Bilateral Relations , Six - Party Talks ------------------------------------
10 .
( C )
United States - China relations are "" developing smoothly , "" Li said , which benefits both of our countries and the entire world .
He agreed with the Ambassador 's assessment that our common interests have led to increased cooperation in a number of areas , including on North Korea .
Li welcomed the progress achieved in the last round of Six - Party Talks , BEIJING 00001760 003 OF 004 noting that , above all , Liaoning residents hope to see a stable and peaceful Korean Peninsula .
Li alleged that he had witnessed no changes in flows of North Koreans into Liaoning .
He believed , however , that the DPRK has been "" strictly controlling "" the border .
Trade Relations : Boosting Domestic Spending
-------------------------------------------- 11 .
( C )
The Ambassador raised the large trade imbalance between the United States and China , explaining that one of our priorities in the Strategic Economic Dialogue ( SED ) is to encourage Chinese consumers to spend more by addressing deficiencies in China 's social safety net and healthcare systems that result in large precautionary savings .
In reply , Li said China is committed to boosting domestic consumption and imports , as well as further developing its pension , welfare and healthcare systems .
China is doing this , in part , because of its international commitments , including under the WTO .
But doing so also clearly promotes China 's further development in a globalized economy .
12 .
( C )
China 's low consumption rates are due , in part , to the Chinese people 's tradition of frugality and China 's overall low level of development , Li claimed .
As China continues to develop and incomes rise , consumption rates will naturally increase .
In the past few years , increases in domestic consumption have outstripped GDP growth , a trend that will continue .
As Chinese companies continue to grow , they will become strong enough to buy expensive high - end products from overseas , something that is already happening , which was "" unthinkable "" only 10 years ago .
China is also making progress in improving its social safety nets .
In Liaoning , all residents are covered under pension and social security systems .
The problem is that these systems ' standards remain low and must continue to be raised , Li said .
Free Trade vs. Protectionism ----------------------------
13 .
( C ) Referring to perceived increased protectionist sentiment on Capitol Hill
, Li said one problem is that Members of Congress who have never visited China do not understand the great changes that have taken place here over the past 30 years .
The best solution is to invite more Members to visit .
The Ambassador , while emphasizing American support for free trade , told Li that concern in the United States over the trade deficit and jobs is real .
There is a widespread perception in the United States that China is not playing fair , especially with respect to the RMB exchange rate , IPR protection and market access , particularly for services .
14 .
( C ) Changing tack , Li launched into a spirited defense of free trade .
If we resort to protectionism , we will all lose , he averred .
Both China and the United States can make protectionist arguments in virtually every sector .
Even in the financial sector , China could use the excuse of protecting jobs , not financial security , to lobby against market opening , given the millions of workers in state - owned banks .
The same holds true for the service , distribution and retail sectors .
But we can not resort to protectionism , he emphasized .
If China does not open its financial sector , its financial industry will lose competitiveness and the public will be dissatisfied .
Moreover , China must play by WTO rules , which requires market opening .
Similarly , if Chinese products are barred from the United States , the standard of living for most Americans will be compromised and they will be dissatisfied .
"" We are in the process of opening up , "" Li said .
Congress should keep this in mind when looking at China , he asserted , reiterating that the PRC is boosting both domestic consumption and imports .
Intel Investment in Dalian -------------------------- 15 .
( C ) Regarding export licenses for Intel 's possible investment in Dalian ( see reftel ) , the Ambassador told Li that Intel is working closely with the appropriate government agencies to ensure full compliance with United States export - control requirements .
Li was grateful for the information , stressing how important major multinational corporations like Intel are to Liaoning 's future development .
More than just the capital invested and the chips produced , Liaoning hopes to learn from Intel 's advanced management techniques .
There will be absolutely no obstacles to the investment on the Chinese side , as the Central Government has already approved the investment .
Intel 's president will visit China later this month , and if all goes well , there may be a signing ceremony to finalize the deal , Li said .

Bio Info -------- 16 .
( C )
Li Keqiang remains one of the front runners to ascend to the Politburo this fall , perhaps even to the Politburo Standing Committee , and to succeed Hu Jintao in 2012 .
With the Ambassador , Li was engaging and well - informed on a wide range of issues .
He displayed a good sense of humor and appeared relaxed and confident throughout .
Though coy about his hobbies and interests , Li said he likes to "" walk , "" noting that he builds walking into his work schedule and implying that he has little time for other exercise .
Although he spoke almost entirely in Chinese , Li clearly understood some English , correcting his interpreter on several occasions .
Li expressed an interest in visiting the United States , noting that his last trip was six years ago , prior to the September 11 attacks .
On several previous occasions , he traveled widely in the United States , visiting both coasts and the Midwest .
Li said he particularly liked Oklahoma .

REASONS 1.4 B AND D. 1 .
( C ) Summary .
Zhejiang Province Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping , a contender to succeed President Hu Jintao in 2012/2013 , describes Zhejiang as a driving force behind national economic growth .
Zhejiang ranks high for income , low for income disparities , and makes substantial contributions to migrant worker employment and transfer payments of fiscal revenue to the Central Government .
Xi dismissed concerns about overheating , noting that the faster his province grows , the greater the amount of revenues that the province will transfer to the Central Government .
Those revenues also support economic development in comparatively poor regions in Central and Western China .
Provincial party and government officials are regularly informed of citizens ' complaints and plan to address recurring concerns about education , affordable housing and healthcare .
The provincial Communist Party is committed to building the legal underpinnings of China 's socialist market economy .
National People 's Congress passage of the Property Law will be beneficial to building China 's market economy and to Zhejiang .
Unification of corporate tax rates will be a great benefit to Zhejiang companies while not deterring new foreign investment .
Xi expressed satisfaction with his May 2006 visit to the United States .
He is a fan of Hollywood World War II movies and criticizes Chinese moviemakers for neglecting values they should promote .
His frank and friendly dinner discussion with the Ambassador included several comparisons that Xi made to other provinces where other leading contenders now hold leadership roles , comparisons in which Zhejiang looks better .
End Summary .
Booming Zhejiang Is a National Economic Leader --------------------------------------------- - 2 .
( C )
At a March 11 dinner hosted by the Ambassador at his residence , Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi Jinping responded to a series of questions about Zhejiang Provincial economic performance with an impressive array of data and interesting observations .
Zhejiang Province 's exports surpassed USD 100 billion in 2006 , an increase of 31 percent over 2005 , Xi said .
Sixty percent of those 2006 exports were from private enterprises , and the 2006 rate of increase of exports for those private enterprises amounted to 40 percent .
While unable to provide an immediate savings rate figure for Zhejiang residents , Xi asserted that most Zhejiang residents have more than enough money to cover expenses for basic needs .
Prudential savings nonetheless remain high in recognition of the incomplete nature of China 's social security system and to prepare for possible future consumption items such as health care .
While a small proportion of the province 's population remains near poverty and requires assistance from government , perhaps 20 percent of Zhejiang 's approximately 50 million residents are high income earners within the Chinese context .
They do n't know how to spend all their money , Xi said .
China 's stock markets are not mature and thus hold risks unattractive to many Chinese , and the investment fund industry is likewise immature and unattractive .
The Ambassador interjected that Treasury Secretary Paulson had discussed China 's capital markets and financial sector reform in a speech in Shanghai just three days earlier and presented a Chinese text of Secretary Paulson 's speech to Secretary Xi .
SIPDIS 3 .
( C )
In their search for money - making opportunities and wealth preservation strategies , Xi continued , many rich Chinese can not find proper outlets for their cash .
This helps feed illegal financial activities , such as deceptive claims on the Internet and private but illegal banks and investment funds that claim to pay higher interest rates than are generally available in China .
The Chinese Government and the Chinese people place high hopes that the bilateral dialogue mechanism established through the Strategic Economic Dialogue ( SED ) can help solve some practical problems in China 's financial sectors .
Secretary Xi said he hopes that Secretary Paulson and the Ambassador will play important SIPDIS roles in the SED as it moves forward .
Xi added that he hopes the United States Congress will show enough patience to allow Secretary Paulson sufficient time to solve some of these SIPDIS problems .
4 .
( C )
Secretary Xi proudly and easily rolled off numerous BEIJING 00001840 002 OF 007 Zhejiang provincial economic data .
Provincial GDP increased 13.6 percent in 2006 , with per capita GDP now
USD 4,000 --
well , USD 3,975 to be exact , he clarified .
Only Guangdong , Jiangsu and Shandong have greater provincial GDPs , and on a per capita GDP basis , Zhejiang ranks first among all provinces and only lags the centrally administered cities of Shanghai , Beijing and Tianjin in this regard .
Per capita GDP in the provincial capital of Hangzhou is now about USD 6000 and in the port city of Ningbo now about USD 6500 .
Zhejiang ranks first in the nation in fiscal revenue and per capita disposable income , too .
5 .
( C ) Zhejiang gets to keep about half of the fiscal revenue collected in the province , with about half sent to the Central Government .
In 2006 , Zhejiang collected 256 billion renminbi in fiscal revenue ( 90 percent in taxes , 10 percent in items not clearly identified in Xi 's comments ) , of which 130 billion RMB was retained for local uses .
Furthermore , fiscal revenue data do not include other funds available to the government , such as government investment funds , social security funds , or tariffs collected by Customs officials at Zhejiang ports of entry ( the latter funds go directly to the Central Government , Xi added ) .
Xi said that income for all levels of government generated from all sources in Zhejiang in 2006 was probably near 500 billion RMB .
Dismissive of Overheating Concerns
---------------------------------- 6 .
( C )
The Ambassador asked whether Central Government officials are concerned about possible economic overheating in Zhejiang .
Secretary Xi replied that the faster Zhejiang grows , the more revenue the Central Government receives .
It is Zhejiang 's hope that the Central Government will keep the share of provincial fiscal revenue that Zhejiang must send to the Central Government stable .
The Ministry of Finance is considering raising that share , a possibility which Xi opposes .
Making the cake bigger ( i.e. , growing Zhejiang 's economy ) will make their piece bigger , too ( i.e. , a fixed percentage of a larger whole will bring an increase in absolute value of funds transferred to the Central Government ) .
Many cities in Eastern China are concerned about this issue .
Xi hopes that Finance Minister Jin Renqing will not think about or act upon this possible increase in revenue sharing burden .
Shouldering Burdens of Central and Western China --------------------------------------------- --- 7 .
( C )
Another issue about which Zhejiang officials are very concerned is the gap in income and economic development levels between the wealthier East Coast regions and China 's Central and Western regions .
Some of the fiscal revenue generated in Zhejiang is allocated to assigned counties and communities elsewhere in China , including some of the highest altitude administrative units in Xizang ( Tibet ) and Xinjiang , the Fuling area of Chongqing Municipality , two impoverished areas in Sichuan Province ( one of which is Nanchong ) and certain Miao ethnic minority areas of Guizhou .
Some of these destinations in Western China can themselves only raise 10 - 30 percent of their annual local government expenditures , while in assigned areas in Central China that proportion may increase to 50 percent .
Transfer payments to local governments in Central and Western China actually come in part from provincial contributions , Xi underscored , lessening the burden of the Central Government .
While Zhejiang sends about 50 percent of its fiscal revenue to the Center , Shanghai must contribute an even higher share , about 65 percent .
An Important Destination for Migrant Workers --------------------------------------------
8 .
( C ) Zhejiang makes two other important contributions to the national economy .
First , Zhejiang hosts China 's second largest population of migrant workers , 14 .5 million .
Only Guangdong hosts more .
The ratio of Zhejiang 's permanent residents ( about 50 million ) to migrants is a little over 3:1 .
Zhejiang thus makes an important contribution to addressing China 's employment challenges .
There is a cost with having so many migrant workers , since 65 percent of issues requiring Public Security attention ( i.e. , crimes ) are caused by migrant workers .
Xi clarified that migrant workers are defined as those who stay for work purposes for less than four months .
Those who stay for more than four months in a BEIJING 00001840 003 OF 007 locale are counted as residents .
Furthermore , in the large number of migrant workers seeking work in Zhejiang are a great many who come to this comparatively rich province from less affluent other provinces and cities .
Xi contrasted his large number of provincial outsiders with the situation in Jiangsu Province , where , he said , many of the migrants are persons from north of the Yangtze who are seeking employment in locations south of the Yangtze , still in their own home province .
An Important Contributor to Economic Development
Elsewhere
---------------------------------------------
------------- 9 .

The other important economic contribution by Zhejiang is the role of 4.4 million businesspersons from Zhejiang are working outside the province elsewhere in China .
Xi said Central Government data does not report the economic impact of these businesspersons .
While there is little foreign direct investment in Central and Western China , including little from the United States , there is considerable investment and business activity in those regions by Zhejiang businesspersons .
Those 4.4 million extra - provincial Zhejiang businesspersons generate another nearly one trillion RMB more in GDP nationwide - nearly as much as the province .
Another 1 million Zhejiang businesspersons live overseas , often building international business links .
So one must recognize that Zhejiang has been a driver of the whole nation 's economic growth .
10 .
( C )
Nearly all other provinces have sent delegations to Zhejiang to study the province 's experience and success .
In recent days , delegations from Xinjiang , Sichuan and Jiangxi had scheduled upcoming appointments to visit and study Zhejiang , bringing large delegations that will include county - level Communist Party secretaries .
Secretary Xi quoted Jiangxi Provincial Party Secretary Meng Jianzhu as saying he and others have much to learn from Zhejiang 's development path .
The experiences of coastal cities such as Shenzhen and Shanghai that are destinations for high levels of foreign investment are not suitable development models .
Income Gap and Urbanization Rate
-------------------------------- 11 .
( C )
The Ambassador inquired about income disparities within Zhejiang Province .
Zhejiang has the second lowest provincial urban / rural income ratio in the nation , at 2.45:1 .
Jiangsu is first , at 2.1:1 , while the national average is 3.3:1 .
However , Zhejiang 's ratio may increase slightly , due to faster income growth for urban residents ( 10.9 percent in 2006 ) than for rural residents ( 9.3 percent in 2006 ) .
While the ratio may worsen slightly , Xi said , the important fact to recognize is that income levels are rising significantly in Zhejiang regardless of being a city dweller or rural resident .
Zhejiang 's population is now about 56 percent urbanized .
With respect to income of urban residents , Zhejiang has ranked first in China for the last six years .
With respect to income of rural residents , Zhejiang has ranked first for the last 22 years .
Xi again volunteered a comparison between Zhejiang and Jiangsu .
Jiangsu 's total average income is less than that of Zhejiang , and the highest income level in Jiangsu , in the city of Suzhou , is only at the level of the average income level for the whole of Zhejiang Province .
The average income level in Zhejiang 's capital of Hangzhou , however , is about the same as the average income level in Shanghai .
12 .
( C ) Zhejiang has maintained these remarkable results because it is an economy of the grassroots -- the common people choose their own development paths , Xi continued .
Zhejiang is an economy of counties and towns ( implying not being a province with a heavy hand of central economic decision making ) .
Of the top 100 most affluent counties in China ( criteria for ranking not clearly explained by Xi ) , 30 of Zhejiang 's total 60 counties are among them .
At the township level , 268 Zhejiang towns rank in the top 1000 towns in China .
Of Zhejiang 's total nine provincial - level municipalities , seven rank in China 's top 100 , and the other two are ranked between 101 and 110 .
Hearing from the Grassroots Level --------------------------------- 13 .
( C )
The Ambassador asked how provincial party and government officials hear from the citizenry and what are the BEIJING 00001840 004
OF 007 most frequent concerns or complaints directed to Zhejiang officials .
Secretary Xi said provincial officials have many sources of information , many of them designed by Provincial Party Secretary General Li Qiang , to whom Xi turned for comment .
Mr. Li explained that the major source of news on the views of the citizenry remains letters .
About 150,000 letters were delivered to Zhejiang offices last year .
The provincial government website provides a link for submission of e - mails from the public .
Party Secretary Xi and provincial government leaders from the Governor on down often lead delegations to the counties to listen to the voices of the citizens .
Provincial officials spend more than 100 days per year conducting research with specific industries or in different areas of the province to gather firsthand information .
Government officials can also submit information to Xi at any time .
Media reports on provincial developments are an additional source of news .
The provincial Communist Party itself also gathers information from the public .
So , the Provincial Party Secretary has uninterrupted access to the views of the general public , Li concluded .
Concerns about Education , Housing and Health Care Common
---------------------------------------------
----------- 14 .
( C ) Zhejiang residents are most concerned about three basic issues : education , affordable housing , and health care , Secretary Xi said .
The government must take a realistic attitude in addressing these concerns .
While not all concerns can or should be addressed fully - for instance , not every child in the cities and in the countryside will matriculate to the highest ranked universities -- the government should act to ensure that all children receive an education , people have basic affordable housing , and all residents have access to at least basic medical care .
Zhejiang is doing a good job in all these respects , Xi asserted , even leading the whole country .
While China has a per capita GDP level of about USD 1000 , Zhejiang is already at about USD 4000 .
This leads to higher expectations for the work of provincial officials and party leaders .
So new proposals will be forthcoming on how to improve the lives of Zhejiang residents .
Officials ' Work Styles
Another Common Concern --------------------------------------------- 15 .
( C )
Another area in which dissatisfaction has been expressed regards the working style of government and party officials , Xi added .
We will make energetic efforts to improve on this score .
Surely the situation will improve in the long term but there is a long way to go .
With 70 million persons holding membership in the Communist Party of China , it should not be surprising that several thousand may be problem cases .
However , the complaint letters from the people show the people still have faith in the Party and hope the Party will solve such problems within the Party .
For the present , the people will not take to the streets to complain about officials ' work styles .
While there are many problem makers in the Party , the Party also counts among its members the elite of society .
Crime and Wastefulness , Too --------------------------- 16 .
( C )
Secretary Xi briefly mentioned crime and government waste as other topics of public complaint .
He did not elaborate any further on crime , but noted that once basic needs for food and clothing have been met , some officials have become wasteful in their use of administrative resources , seeking extravagance in their lifestyles .
More guidance from the government is needed in such cases , in Xi 's view .
He closed his comments on this topic by recalling that China is a big country , with a population exceeding one billion persons .
When you multiply something by more than one billion , you get a big number ; but if you divide something , like GDP , by more than one billion , you get a small result .
Deng Xiaoping was right in observing that China is still at a primary stage of development .
Expectations for This National People 's Congress Session
---------------------------------------------
----------- 17 .
( C )
Shanghai Consul General Jarrett , noting the important role of the private sector in the Zhejiang economy , asked Secretary Xi about the current meeting of the National BEIJING 00001840 005
OF 007 People 's Congress and expected passage of a Property Law .
Is there any dissent against the proposed law in Zhejiang ?
What will the law mean for Zhejiang ?
Xi expects that the NPC will enact the Property Law during the current session .
Discussion of a Property Law began in the sixth NPC , about twenty years ago .
Now is the right time to enact the law , passage is needed to support the legal regime of China 's socialist market economy .
The Property Law will equally protect state - owned , collectively - owned assets and private properties .
The law should also protect against stripping of assets from state - owned enterprises and protect the general public 's growing holdings of private property .
In the past , China gave lip service to property protection , with the destruction of property in the Cultural Revolution being an example .
Private property plays a leading role in Zhejiang 's economic development , so nearly everyone in Zhejiang agrees with passage of the Property Law .
With property protection in place , Chinese can gain even more wealth .
18 .
( C )
Another measure to be passed in this NPC session will unify corporate taxation rates for foreign - invested enterprises and domestic enterprises .
Chinese companies will see their tax rates decline from 33 percent to 25 percent , while FIEs will have a five - year transitional period as their tax holidays are phased out and their tax rates climb to 25 percent .
Tax unification is very good news for Zhejiang companies , Secretary Xi said .
For example , the Ningbo manufacturer ( heard as Ningbo Ya Ge
Er ) of the suit he wore to dinner has told Xi that the reduction of his corporate tax rate will save his company 40 million RMB per year .
Because foreign investors who are newcomers to China consider more than just the corporate tax rate in selecting overseas investment destinations , the increased tax rate should not significantly hurt them , Xi asserted .
Rule of Law in Zhejiang Province -------------------------------- 19 .
( C )
The Ambassador asked for Secretary Xi 's views on the development and implementation of rule of law in Zhejiang .
Xi replied that the Party Provincial Committee has proposed in 2006 to build Zhejiang into a province ruled by law .
Laws are a basis for the socialist market economy .
Provincial officials will promote public awareness of laws and do their best to enhance enforcement of laws .
The Provincial People 's Congress will cobine laws as passed at the national level by the NPC with Zhejiang 's local conditions .
The government and the Party will promote rule of law .
A provincial working group on rule of law has been established , and Li Qiang is Director General of that working group .
Local laws should accord with central laws .
Zhejiang can provide some pioneering efforts in rule of law for the whole country .
Xi 's 2006 Visit to the United States ------------------------------------
20 .
( C )
The Ambassador asked Secretary Xi for details of his May 2006 visit to the United States and whether he had had opportunity to exchange views with members of Congress while in Washington .
Xi indeed had met with members of Congress , and found those he met with quite friendly towards China .
One member described himself or herself as formerly quite anti - China but his / her views had begun to shift .
Xi and his delegation had been worried that Falun Gong practitioners might pose a threat during their visit , and accordingly had some security assistants accompany them on their visit .
All had proceeded smoothly with no encounters with the Falun Gong .
Xi said he and other Chinese officials are not worried or annoyed by noise or protests during visits but are worried about the legal consequences and burdens if served papers as part of stateside legal actions .
21 .
( C )
The May 2006 trip had proven fruitful for Zhejiang , Secretary Xi continued , with several important contracts SIPDIS signed that only more recently or even in the near future will be implemented .
Among those agreements is one involving Federal Express , which will have ceremonies at the Hangzhou ( Zhejiang Province 's capital ) airport for the construction or opening of a new distribution center .
Citibank decided to accelerate plans to establish a branch in Hangzhou .
Xi has written to China Banking Regulatory Chairman Liu Mingkang to urge accelerated processing of that application and , while expressing confidence the application will be approved soon , Xi commented to his colleagues that additional lobbying may BEIJING 00001840 006 OF 007 be in order .
The Ambassador thanked Xi for his support to Motorola for that company 's production plans in Hangzhou .
Motorola is doing well in Hangzhou , with Hangzhou 's sales revenue nearing 45 billion renminbi ( over USD 5 billion ) in 2006 , just slightly less than Motorola sales revenue generated at its Tianjin facilities .
Hangzhou sales revenue will surely eclipse Tianjin sales revenue in 2007 .
Finally , the 2006 visit to the United States had included commemoration of the twenty - fifth anniversary of the establishment of sister state relations between Zhejiang and New Jersey .
A New Jersey university decided to set up a branch campus in Wenzhou in Zhejiang , a plan already approved by all relevant provincial authorities but still awaiting approval by the central Ministry of Education .
A WWII Hollywood Movie Aficionado --------------------------------- 22 .
( C )
The Ambassador also asked Secretary Xi about his recent movie viewing , recalling that Xi had told him in their meeting one year ago that he had recently seen and tremendously enjoyed "" Saving Private Ryan . ""
Had Secretary Xi seen other recent American movies that he had enjoyed ?
Xi replied that he already owns the "" Flags of Our Fathers "" DVD , but hopes to view it during the Lunar New Year holidays had gone unfulfilled .
He had seen and enjoyed "" The Departed . ""
Xi said he particularly likes Hollywood movies about World War II and hopes Hollywood will continue to make them .
Hollywood makes those movies well , and such Hollywood movies are grand and truthful .
Americans have a clear outlook on values and clearly demarcate between good and evil .
In American movies , good usually prevails .
In contrast , "" Curse of the Golden Flower , "" a recently popular Chinese movie directed by Zhang Yimou and starring Gong Li ( she of "" Miami Vice "" movie stardom ) had been confusing to Xi .
Some Chinese moviemakers neglect values they should promote .
23 .
( C ) America is a powerful nation in terms of culture because Americans say what they should say , Xi elaborated .
Too many Chinese moviemakers cater to foreigners ' interests or preconceptions , sometimes vulgarly so .
He criticized Zhang Yimou by name as well as the kungfu action movie genre . ""
Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon "" and "" Wu Ji "" and imperial palace intrigues -- all are the same , talking about bad things in imperial palaces .
Most are not nominated for Oscars or other awards , so to some extent it can be said that such movies are not worth very much .
The Ambassador noted that a Chinese film about HIV / AIDS orphans had just garnered the Oscar for best short documentary .
Xi expressed awareness of the movie , noting that the director is a female overseas Chinese ( but Xi never said whether he had seen that documentary ) .
Xi recalled that a low cost , very good Chinese movie by the director Jia Zhangke had recently won a Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival .
Returning to "" Flags of Our Fathers , "" Xi said he had come to understand that the flag raising on Iwo Jima did not mark the end of the battle .
The Japanese were still in holes and caves and the battle continued .
He expressed particular admiration for WWII movies set in the Pacific theater of operations and expressed a strong desire to visit Guadalcanal .
24 .
( C )
Many Chinese had died in the Anti - Japanese War ( as WWII is most often referred to in Mainland China ) .
The last one to two decades have been a period of historical importance , with peace and rapid economic development .
China should use this opportunity to focus on improving the living conditions of the people .
Xi noted some earlier but brief periods of peace and economic development in China , referring to two emperors ' reigns in the Han Dynasty , the reign of the first emperor in the Tang Dynasty , and the consecutive reigns of Emperors Kangxi , Yongzheng and Qianlong in the Ming Dynasty .
It was a crime that such periods did not last longer .
The current period of peace and rapid economic development should be extended as long as possible .
Comment ------- 25 .
( C )
Secretary Xi , regarded by many Embassy contacts to be one of the three leading contenders to succeed President Hu Jintao in 2012/2013 as Communist Party Chairman and President of China , certainly exhibited an easy and proficient familiarity with his relatively prosperous province 's economic data and development strengths .
Comparisons to Jiangsu Province and reference to Henan were BEIJING 00001840 007 OF 007 perhaps inevitable for an official with the strong ambitions he reportedly holds .
The other two leading contenders to succeed President Hu are Li Yuanchao ( Ambassador 's March 8 dinner reported ref A ) , current Party Secretary in Jiangsu , and Li Keqiang , past Party Secretary in Henan ( Ambassador 's March 12 dinner reported ref B ) .
End comment .
RANDT"
2011-01-05,"A photograph of what is reported to be a new Chinese stealth fighter and "" carrier - killer "" missile has prompted concerns that a tilt in the balance of military power in the western Pacific towards China may come sooner than expected .
The emergence of the hi - tech weaponry - which would make it more difficult for the US navy and air force to project power close to Taiwan and elsewhere on China 's coastline - comes at a politically sensitive time .
Later this month , President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart , Hu Jintao , will hold a summit in Washington aimed at patching up their differences after a niggling year in bilateral relations .
The photograph , of what appears to be a prototype J-20 jet undergoing runway tests , has been circulating on the internet since last week , fuelling speculation that China 's fifth - generation fighter may fly ahead of forecast .
The defence ministry has yet to comment on the image , which seems to have been shot from long - distance near the Chengdu aircraft design institute .
The photographer is also unknown , which has added to the mystery about its origins and authenticity as well as the motive of the distributor .
But defence analysts believe this is the first glimpse of the twin - engined , chiselled - nosed plane that mixes Russian engine technology with a fuselage design similar to that of the US air force 's F-22 "" stealth "" fighter , which can avoid detection by radar .
If confirmed , it would be an impressive step forward for the Chinese air force , which until now has largely depended on foreign - made or designed planes .
"" I 'd say these are , indeed , genuine photos of a prototype that will make its maiden flight very soon , "" said Peter Felstead , the editor of Jane 's Defence Weekly .
The J20 is likely to be many years from deployment , but the US defence secretary , Robert Gates - who visits Beijing next week - may have to revise an earlier prediction that China will not have a fifth generation aircraft by 2020 .
It is not the only challenge to US superiority in the region .
China has refurbished a Ukranian aircraft carrier and wants to build its own by 2020 .
A more immediate threat is posed by China 's adaptation of an intermediate - range ballistic missile - the DF-21D - to target US aircraft carriers .
This project is also further advanced than previously believed .
Admiral Robert Willard , the US navy 's commander in the Pacific , warned last month that the weapon - nicknamed the "" carrier killer ' - had reached "" initial operational capability "" .
Faced by this threat US battle groups are likely to take a more withdrawn position if there is a standoff over Taiwan than they did in 1996 , when the USS Nimitz sailed through the strait . ""
The main implication of China deploying this system is that it would certainly make the US navy pause before deciding to project naval power into the South China Sea region during a time of tension , "" said Felstead .
But China 's ambassador to the UK , Liu Xiaoming , said today that his country had no ambitions to rival US military power in the western Pacific region .
"" We do not see ourselves as rivals to the US .
We believe the US and China can work together in the region , "" Liu said , arguing there was a double standard in the west towards Chinese defence spending .
"" When China carries out an exercise on its own territory there is a lot of attention , but when the United States comes all the way across the Pacific for exercises with its allies , no one speaks about it in the same way .
There is a cold war mentality still .
If you develop your defence capability , they [ the Americans ] are annoyed .
But our defence construction is purely for self - defence .
China 's defence expenditure is still the lowest among the five permament members of the [ UN ] security council .
"" China 's military advances worry many in the east Asian region who have benefited for decades from the US - policed status quo .
In its latest defence white paper , Japan noted that China 's military spending had nearly quadrupled over the past decade , while its own shrank by 4 % due to a stagnant economy .
Officials in Tokyo have also expressed alarm at the increasingly confrontational approach of Chinese vessels in disputed fisheries .
In Washington , rightwing thinktanks and commentators want Obama and Gates to apply diplomatic pressure on China to join the intermediate nuclear forces ( INF ) treaty and halt its missile buildup .
The photographs of the J20 jet are also likely to prompt calls for accelerated production of F22s - the US 's most advanced stealth fighter - to ensure air superiority .
The US remains the most potent military force in the western Pacific with 60,000 troops , a military airbase in Okinawa and one forward - deployed carrier fleet .
The US also outspends China on defence by a ratio of six to one , according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .
Even so , while China 's economy grows rapidly and the US remains sluggish , fears of a shift in the balance of power are likely to grow .
It will not happen overnight and worldwide , but China appears to be steadily pushing the US back from its shores in a strategy know as "" area denial "" .
The government has not confirmed this approach .
Chinese nationalists want their country to be more assertive , but they say the priority is to improve defence of an increasingly wealthy coastal region .
The "" area denial "" strategy can be seen as China trying to manage its own market and routes to main trading partners such as South Korea and Japan .
"" We do n't need the US to be the policeman in the west Pacific area , "" said Song Xiaojun , a former naval officer who now edits military magazines .
"" China 's priority is to develop its near sea defence , because our economy is concentrated on the coast .
But we have to reconsider the concept of ' near sea ' to fit a modern age in which military threats can come from far away .
China must improve its defences , but that does not mean we are a threat .
Only arms merchants would say that to persuade the US to raise military spending .
The US is far ahead , "" he said .
•
This article was amended on 14 January 2011 .
In the original , the next US generation of stealth fighter was given as the F35 .
This has been corrected ."
2011-01-11,"Hu Jintao today confirmed that China had carried out its first test flight of a stealth fighter jet , the US defence secretary has said .
Robert Gates , who is in Beijing for talks intended to improve military ties between the countries , said the Chinese president had told him the jet 's trial had not been arranged to coincide with his visit .
"" I asked President Hu about it directly , and he said that the test had absolutely nothing to do with my visit and had been a pre - planned test , "" Gates told reporters .
Asked whether he believed that , he added : "" I take President Hu at his word that the test had nothing to do with my visit . ""
A Pentagon official told Reuters that Hu and other civilian leaders at the meeting with Gates did not appear to be aware that the J-20 flight had happened before the US questioned them about it . ""
When Secretary Gates raised the question of the J-20 test in the meeting with President Hu , it was clear that none of the civilians in the room had been informed , "" the official said .
Hu 's confirmation came after accounts and pictures of the J-20 prototype 's short flight appeared on Chinese websites .
The fighter is believed to have flown over an airfield in the south - western city of Chengdu for about 15 minutes .
Photographs said to show the aeroplane going through runway tests had previously been seen , but Hu 's comments were the first official acknowledgement of the project .
Some interpreted the timing as a sign that Beijing had heeded calls for greater transparency about its military programme , while others thought it more likely to be a show of strength .
Reports suggest China 's progress in developing a rival to the US F-22 stealth fighterhas been faster than expected , although it is thought it will take years before the plane is in service .
The F-22 is the only operational stealth fighter , although the US is developing the F-35 joint strike fighter , and Russia 's Sukhoi T-50 is expected to enter service in about 2015 .
The Associated Press reported that people who answered calls at government and Communist party offices in Chengdu and at the J-20 's developer , the Chengdu Aircraft Industrial Group , had refused to comment .
China 's military modernisation programme and heavy investment in new technology such as the Dongfeng anti - ship missile is reducing the military gap with the US and tilting the power balance in the region .
Gates acknowledged that China 's development of military equipment had outpaced US intelligence estimates and said it "" clearly [ has ] potential to put some of our capabilities at risk "" .
He is meeting civilian leaders , having agreed minor improvements in military to military links during meetings with the Chinese defence minister , General Liang Guanglie , yesterday .
Both sides said stronger ties were needed , and Liang made a point of warning the US against selling further arms to Taiwan .
Beijing suspended military exchanges last year in protest at such a deal .
The Chinese military 's budget has soared to 532bn yuan ( £ 52bn ) , although last year 's increase of 7.5 % was the smallest for more than two decades .
Outside experts believe the real level of funding is far higher , although it is still thought to lag well behind that of the US . ""
Some countries , which have a far better international security situation than China , have world - leading levels of military research , "" the army 's official newspaper , the Liberation Army Daily , wrote in an article on Gates 's visit today .
"" In such circumstances , China should not be unjustly excoriated for developing a few modern weapons . """
2011-01-16,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , has held out the prospect of a clash with President Barack Obama over human rights when the two meet at the White House on Wednesday .
Hu , in a rare interview with the western media , told the Washington Post that the US and China should respect each other 's route to development – code for not interfering in each other 's domestic agenda .
The White House said last week that Obama would raise the issue of China 's poor human rights record at the meeting .
Hu arrives in Washington for the start of a four - day visit to the US on Tuesday .
Since Obama became president in January 2009 , he has pivoted US foreign policy to make Asia in general and China in particular his main priority .
For the first time in US history , Washington now regards Asia as more important than Europe , a recognition of Beijing 's increasing influence in the Pacific and round the world .
But relations have been strained over the last year , with the US angry over what it sees as China 's failure to use its influence over North Korea to prevent repeated confrontations with South Korea , and its unwillingness to tackle the discrepancy between the Chinese currency , the yuan , and the dollar .
Washington accuses China of currency manipulation that is impacting on US jobs .
In an interview conducted under strict terms , with questions put by the Post and the Wall Street Journal in writing and with written answers in return , Hu acknowledged there were problems .
"" There is no denying that there are some differences and sensitive issues between us .
We both stand to gain from a sound China - US relationship , and lose from confrontation , "" he said .
But he added the two countries should "" respect each other 's choice of development path "" .
Hu said there must be political reform in China to "" meet people 's growing enthusiasm for participating in political affairs "" , but he added : "" We will define the institutions , standards and procedures for socialist democracy , expand people 's ordinary participation in political affairs at each level and in every field , mobilise and organise the people as extensively as possible , and strive for continued progress in building socialist political civilisation . ""
Hu is to be met on arrival in Washington by the vice - president , Joe Biden , and will hold a joint press conference with Obama at the White House on Wednesday after the talks .
It is a state visit , in contrast with a relatively low - key affair in 2006 when President George W Bush limited the occasion to lunch .
On the sensitive issue of currency , Hu offered no hint of compromise , other than to say the international community should now work to "" move toward the establishment of a fair , just , inclusive and well - managed international financial order "" and "" build a new and more equal and balanced global partnership "" that would address the disparities between the developed world and poorer countries , which he called "" the north and the south "" .
On North Korea , he insisted China had "" made relentless efforts "" to calm tensions on the Korean peninsula and there have been signs of relaxation .
At a White House briefing on Friday , the national security adviser , Tom Donilon , said Obama and Hu would discuss security and political issues , such as North Korea , Iran and Sudan , as well as economic issues ."
2011-01-17,"The White House is to throw a lavish reception for the Chinese leader , Hu Jintao , on Wednesday in an effort to patch up relations after a difficult year dominated by tensions over currency rates , jobs , North Korea and other international issues .
President Hu is due in Washington tomorrow for the start of a four - day visit , the highlight of which is to be a state dinner at the White House on Wednesday evening .
Hu is to go from Washington to Chicago on Thursday for two days .
The mayor of Chicago , Richard Daley , announcing details of the visit last week , including a gala dinner as well as trips to a Chinese car spare parts factory and a Chinese language school , reflected US excitement about the trip .
"" It is a big deal .
Big , big , big , big .
Big deal , "" Daley said .
Given China 's pivotal role in the global economy and in foreign affairs , it is the most important state visit of the Obama presidency so far .
Obama needs China 's help in turning the US economy round , particularly in creating jobs , and in resolving tensions on the Korean peninsula and exerting pressure on Iran .
China analysts in Washington expressed little hope of any substantial agreement on economics or foreign affairs and said the importance of the meeting was the opportunity for the two to establish a good personal relationship .
A US economics team sent to Beijing to help negotiate agreements to be announced this week returned to Washington last Friday reporting a lack of progress so far .
Instead there are a series of small US - China business deals , about 40 so far , to be announced in Chicago .
Hu is to attend a small dinner at the White House evening with the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , and the White House national security adviser , Tom Donilon .
The black - tie dinner at the White House on Wednesday night contrasts with George Bush 's workmanlike lunch in 2006 .
According to Chinese media reports at the time , Hu , who , like other Chinese leaders , places a lot of importance on protocol , saw Bush 's arrangements as insulting .
Bush was unwilling to host a state dinner in part because he was conscious of US public concern over China 's human rights record .
Unlike 2006 , this will be a state visit , with all the ceremony that entails .
It will be the first US state dinner for a Chinese leader in 13 years .
The president and first lady will greet Hu on arrival at the White House , followed by a review of troops , lengthy talks , a joint press conference and the dinner .
The White House has not yet released details of who will be the chef or who will provide the entertainment .
Human rights demonstrators , pro - Tibet supporters , Uighurs , Taiwanese and others are planning to pursue Hu on every leg of his trip , and are to hold a rally and candlelit vigil outside the White House during the state dinner .
Douglas Paal , one of the leading US analysts on China and vice - president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , previewing the visit last week , said it will allow the US and China to move past a turbulent year .
"" We 've had tensions in the South China Sea , East China Sea , Yellow Sea ; with North Korea ; and over other issues including economics .
This is a chance to pull things back together again and we 've seen this opportunity developing over the last few months since the notion of a state visit was put on the agenda in September , ""
Paal said .
A slight improvement in exchange rates from a US point of view has taken some of the sting out of currency tensions .
Members of Congress had been planning to name China as a currency manipulator , a move that could sour relations but that now seems to be on hold .
But there are still problems .
Democratic congressman Mike Michaud is circulating a letter in the House hoping to gather signatures to send to Obama asking him to tell Hu that consistent violations of international trade law will no longer be tolerated .
"" China 's disregard for its World Trade Organisation membership directly hurts the US economy and impedes our ability to recover from the economic downturn , "" Michaud said .
Members of Congress are also focusing on China 's human rights record .
Several members are hosting a press conference that includes two leaders from the Tiananmen Square crackdown , Chai Ling and Yang Jianli , and Harry Wu , who spent 19 years in Chinese labour camps ."
2011-01-17,"White House talks between Barack Obama and China 's president , Hu Jintao , which begin on Tuesday night , are not just any old summit .
The former US national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski summed up the mood , describing the meeting as "" the most important top - level US - China encounter since Deng Xiaoping 's historic trip more than 30 years ago "" .
As some in China and the US see it , the choice boils down to one of future war or peace .
Historically speaking , empires always fight .
Successive American administrations have struggled to define the relationship between the world 's leading superpower and the rising star of Asia that threatens to supplant it .
Past summits often produced little of substance .
Now , facing critical public , congressional and business scrutiny , Obama is under pressure to stand up for US interests and obtain tangible results .
The past year brought a series of public clashes , reinforcing a growing US belief that China was swapping its designated role as strategic partner for that of strategic rival .
Specific issues –
Beijing 's supposed unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft , US arms sales to Taiwan and South China Sea security disputes , the attempted gagging of Google , and the continued detention of the Nobel peace prizewinner Liu Xiaobo – raised the bilateral temperature , sometimes to boiling point .
Some rightwing commentators claim the US and China are already at war , if not yet in the conventional sense , and accuse Obama of naivety .
Through currency manipulation , commercial attrition and expanding overseas investment , Hu is pursuing "" war by other means "" , said Irwin Stelzer in the Weekly Standard , adding : "" The communist regime sees trade policy as merely one strategic weapon in a war aimed at overtaking the US as the world 's pre - eminent economic and military power . ""
He cited the boast of China 's defence minister , General Liang Guanglie , that "" in the next five years our military will push forward preparations for military conflicts in every strategic direction "" .
While firmly rejecting war analogies , the White House knows it has a fight on its hands on many fronts – economic , political , ideological .
Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state , said last week that relations had reached a crucial juncture : "" It is up to both nations to translate the high - level pledges of summits and state visits into action .
Real action , on real issues . ""
Tim Geithner , the treasury secretary , Robert Gates at defence and Obama himself have all joined Clinton in setting out what the US expects from China .
Their shopping list includes fuller co - operation on nuclear proliferation and climate change , stronger Chinese support on specific problems such as Iran and North Korea , and a more "" responsible "" exchange rate policy .
White House aides say Obama also plans to publicly step up pressure on human rights .
Obama met leading US - based Chinese human rights advocates last week , discussing how best to influence attitudes from within .
According to the Washington Post , Obama recalled his childhood in Indonesia , then governed by a dictatorship .
"" One thing he kept coming back to was – how does the omnipresence of the state , how does corruption , affect the lives of real people ? "" one official said .
"" And he asked how we should use our leverage …
There was a lot of talk about how to reach into China to be heard .
"" The problem with America 's exhortatory approach to human rights and other issues is that it rarely works .
Clinton admitted that Beijing resented such interventions as an infringement of sovereignty .
And trying to spread the civil liberties message Iran - style , behind the Communist party 's back , is hazardous .
It may only compound the problem , hurting those Obama seeks to help .
China has its hardliners , too .
They would undoubtedly exploit such action to weaken Hu and the party 's reform wing .
This unpalatable reality reflects a bigger truth : the US must stop trying to tell China what to do .
The time for that has passed .
China is too big to be bullied , too canny to be conned , too complicated to be changed from without .
And it can not sensibly be blamed for America 's declining global clout .
Some self - awareness , a focus on practical , mutually beneficial measures , and a little circumspection would ultimately work better to stop a war of words turning into something worse .
That 's not to say human rights abuses can be ignored .
But grandstanding will not help .
Hu wants a successful summit .
He retires next year – and is enough of a politician to want to assure his legacy .
But he 's not going to roll over .
Before getting on the plane , he warned Obama to tread carefully or risk deepening estrangement .
"" We both stand to gain from a sound China - US relationship , and lose from confrontation , "" Hu said .
The two countries should "" respect each other 's choice of development path "" .
This summit marks a strategic turning point .
Hu 's constituency is the Communist party , the People 's Liberation Army , and an increasingly nationalistic Chinese public .
Bowing to America is not part of their 21st century script ."
2011-01-17,"Amid the usual hustle and bustle of Times Square , visitors to New York should expect to see an unusual figure this week : Chinese basketball star Yao Ming , stretched to many times his 2.29 metres , on the giant screen .
Yao , Jackie Chan and astronaut Yang Liwei feature in an ad campaign commissioned by Beijing to boost its soft power , according to Chinese media .
They are the advance party for President Hu Jintao , who arrives in the US for a state visit tomorrow following a year of unusually fraught relations .
Trade , territorial and human rights issues have caused much tension ; rows over Google and arms sales to Taiwan have added to the problems .
"" When there is a summit , both sides do a lot of public relations work .
I think China will do more [ this time ] , "" said Shi Yinhong , professor of international relations at Renmin University , Beijing .
"" Our leaders need it because the diplomatic performance last year was quite bad .
They want to reassure the American public . ""
Last year was – according to David Shambaugh , a veteran watcher of bilateral relations – the most strained for a decade .
That was all the more striking because some thought President Barack Obama 's visit to Beijing in 2009 was unexpectedly productive .
The joint statement they produced was "" a visionary road map for building the relationship on bilateral , regional , and global levels …
Unfortunately , much of [ it ] was stillborn "" , Shambaugh wrote this week .
The two sides have been frank in acknowledging their differences .
""
When the relationship is strained we need to bear in mind the larger picture and not allow any individual issue to disrupt our overall co - operation , "" vice foreign minister Cui Tiankai said on Friday .
"" Both sides feel strongly it 's time to stabilise relations and reduce tensions and deal with the situation on the peninsula , "" said Shi .
"" I think compared with last year 's situation , it will be quite easy to achieve some sort of success . ""
While they are highly unlikely to agree on how to handle North Korea –
Beijing wants a return to the six - party talks but Washington says Pyongyang must not be rewarded for bad behaviour –
they may find a way to imply progress .
On trade , Beijing has allowed its currency , the renminbi , to appreciate over the last year – albeit not at anything like the rate many in the US want – and it is expected to rise further this year .
The underlying , structural disagreements are another matter .
While there is room for co - operation as well as competition on trade and nonproliferation efforts , human rights and territorial disagreements are largely intractable , suggested Professor Shen Dingli , director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University .
But China mishandled disputes over arms sales to Taiwan , Obama 's meeting with the Dalai Lama and the South China Seas , he said , by taking such a blunt approach : "" It created unnecessary confrontation .
"" This year , it is sending out friendlier signals –
Shen points out it did not accept its ally Iran 's invitation to visit its nuclear facilities .
But while the Chinese military invited US defence secretary Robert Gates to tour its nuclear warfare headquarters last week , it also held the first , unannounced test flight of its new stealth fighter during his visit .
Meanwhile Gates had warm words for Beijing , but subsequently raised questions about a possible "" disconnect "" between the military and civilian leadership ."
2011-01-18,"The last time Hu Jintao arrived in Washington , back in 2006 , he was given a White House working lunch , and by all accounts never forgave George W Bush for the perceived insult .
In contrast , it is highly unlikely China 's leader could find fault with the welcome laid out by the Obama administration : a private White House dinner tonight to be followed later in the week by a full state banquet , a 21-gun salute and all the pomp and circumstance of a review of the troops .
The message is absolutely clear – these are the world 's two leading powers meeting together as equals .
It is that sense of equal status that distinguishes this Washington summit from earlier such encounters .
In terms of absolute size , China 's economy is catching up fast with America 's , and , according to data compiled by the University of Pennsylvania , may even have overtaken the US at some point over the past year .
[ See footnote below . ]
Militarily , the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) is the biggest on earth : 2.2 million soldiers compared to the 1.6 million of the US armed forces .
On the global stage , China has also become a giant too , lending more to developing countries over the past two years than even the World Bank , according to the Financial Times .
But those big figures can be misleading .
America is a rich country , while most of China is still grindingly poor . ""
The development of our own country remains our top priority , "" China 's ambassador to London , Liu Xiaoming , said .
"" In terms of per capita GDP , we are still behind over 100 countries . ""
When it comes to military might too , there is no doubt that US forces are far better equipped , better trained and more powerful than the PLA .
By that ultimate yardstick of superpower status , nuclear weapons , the US far outstrips China .
America is estimated to have over 9,000 warheads , deployed or stockpiled .
China has about 240 .
What puts China on an equal footing with the US , however , is its dynamism .
As Obama and Hu meet in Washington , it is the Chinese leader who can realistically claim to have the wind in his sails .
In the aftermath of the Iraq invasion and the global economic recession , the US democratic - capitalist model no longer appears to be such an inevitable global template .
America is recovering and its economy grew by 3 % last year , and will probably do the same again in 2011 .
But China grew by 10 % and will only slow marginally this year .
While the US administration is wrestling with a growing debt burden made worse by a huge balance of payments deficit , China 's trade surplus in 2010 was $ 183bn ( £ 114bn ) , much of it with the US .
In the first half of 2010 it enjoyed a $ 145bn budget surplus .
The accumulation of vast wealth from selling electrical and electronics goods to the rest of the world has , until recently , been used to buy US government bonds , with the effect of supporting Washington 's need to borrow .
Elizabeth Economy , director of Asia studies at Washington 's Council on Foreign Relations , said : "" I think we have a fundamentally different position from 13 years ago .
The global financial crisis has changed the landscape with regard to China 's economy relative to the US .
China has a global reach in investments and resources and China 's military is fundamentally different . ""
The rise of China has progressed to a degree that none of us appreciated 13 years ago , "" Economy added .
One of the most remarkable aspects of this , she said , was the idea of a Chinese president coming to Washington to discuss the dollar with the US president .
China 's inferiority in "" hard power "" , meanwhile , has turned to Beijing 's advantage .
It is benefiting from being the country that did not invade Iraq , and is not currently bogged down in Afghanistan .
After the Bush experiment in exporting democracy militarily , China 's mantra of non - interference in the affairs of other states seems benign by comparison , particularly in the developing world , where Chinese "" soft power "" has expanded dramatically .
Chinese forces have not fought any wars in recent decades and have not occupied foreign territory , but China is currently the biggest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces .
Signs of China 's rising soft power abound .
The Wall Street Journal estimates that there were 100 million people around the world learning Mandarin and other Chinese languages .
Chinese diplomatic missions are springing up over the globe , and it is catching up with the US state department .
China now has 251 embassies , consulates and missions , compared to America 's 289 .
It is China 's trajectory then , rather than its current power , that gives it superpower status .
Pundits regularly talk about the 21st century as being the Chinese century following the very American 20th century .
The great unknown underlying all these predictions , however , is whether that trajectory is sustainable over the decades to come .
The rise of China may yet hit the limits set by the environment .
It has the misfortune of industrialising at a time of global warming .
It is also far from clear whether the Chinese state capitalist model , which has proved so successful for the country 's development , can support a sophisticated post - industrial society , or whether democracy has long - term advantages that will be felt in the later stages of the great US - China race .

This clarification was added on 19 and 20 January 2011 .
The University of Pennsylvania data were based on a calculation in terms of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) , and show the size of China 's economy in 2010 being $ 14.8tn compared to $ 14.6tn for the US .
Alternative methods of calculation exist , such as the IMF 's World Economic Outlook figures for GDP in current prices using market exchange rates , which , for 2009 , give China 's GDP as $ 5tn and the US 's as $ 14tn .
The IMF 's own PPP estimate puts China at about $ 10tn for 2010 .
The Pennsylvania research challenges both IMF figures for China as being too low ."
2011-01-19,
2011-01-19,"China 's president Hu Jintao was forced on the defensive today on the opening day of his state visit to the US , admitting for the first time in public that his country had to improve its human rights record .
Hu 's visit , intended to improve relations between the two countries after a year of tensions over trade and diplomacy , was overshadowed by the human rights issue .
It has been raised twice by Barack Obama in public , by US reporters at a press conference and by hundreds of demonstrators outside the White House .
It is the first state visit to the US by a Chinese leader in 13 years and , given China 's rise in the intervening period to superpower status , there is lot riding on the outcome for both countries .
But at the joint Obama - Hu press conference , there was embarrassment for the Chinese leader when he claimed not to have heard a question from a US reporter who asked him to justify China 's human rights record .
After listening to a translation of the question and of Obama 's response , Hu completely ignored it .
Later in the press conference , another US reporter asked him why he had not answered .
Hu , laughing , claimed : "" I would like to clarify .
Because of the technical translation and interpretation problems , I did not hear the question about human rights . ""
The Chinese leader then went on to give a rare answer on human rights : "" China is a developing country with a huge population , and also a developing country at a crucial stage of reform .
In this context , China still faces many challenges in economic and social development .
And a lot still needs to be done in China , in terms of human rights . ""
But he went on to remind Americans that while China is prepared to discuss human rights with the US , it would be on the basis of "" mutual respect and the principle of non - interference in each other 's internal affairs "" , basically it is a matter for China to decide .
It is unusual for a Chinese leader such as Hu to face a spontaneous press conference .
Normally he restricts his remarks to scripted speeches .
China has an abysmal record on political dissent , as well as crackdowns on minorities such as Tibetans and Uighurs .
Among high - profile prisoners is dissident Liu Xiaobo , the 2010 Nobel peace prize - winner .
Pro - Tibet groups and other demonstrators plan to follow Hu throughout his visit to Washington and later in the week to Chicago .
Outside the White House and out of the hearing of Hu , about 200 people shouted "" Killer , killer Hu Jintao "" .
They expected their numbers to double later for the carrying of a coffin round the White House to symbolise the death of the Chinese Communist party .
Although the US needs Chinese help in reviving its economy and with international issues such as North Korea and Iran , Obama did not shy away from the human rights issue .
He raised it first at the welcoming ceremony on the White House lawn and again in a statement at the start of the press conference , at which he also called on China to engage with the Dalai Lama about Tibet .
Asked at the press conference about human rights , Obama said he had been very candid with Hu , telling him that although the countries are at different stages of development , "" we have some core views as Americans about the universality of certain rights – freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom of assembly – that we think are very important and that transcend cultures .
"" Obama 's raising of the issue twice in public may reflect a toughening of approach by the US towards China after what Washington sees as the failure of Beijing to respond to American overtures over the last two years .
"" It is a slap in the face for Hu to raise human rights in the opening ceremony , "" said Nicholas Bequelin , a senior researcher with the Asia division of Human Rights Watch .
He added that the Chinese side had done everything it could to avoid such embarrassment .
Elizabeth Economy , director of Asia studies at the US - based Council on Foreign Relations , said that Obama 's remark would not necessarily be interpreted as a snub by Hu . ""
As both a winner of the Nobel peace prize and the president of the US , it was incumbent upon Obama to make such a statement , and I think he did it in a way that was clear and compelling without being insulting , "" she said .
Hu may view the public discussion of human rights as awkward and an embarrassment or may regard it as an opportunity at last to tackle an issue that is hurting China 's global reputation .
A clue will be provided by whether Chinese television and other official media report his remarks .
Hu may have liked to have got through the four - day visit without any reference to human rights and to have kept the focus instead on the pomp and ceremony associated with a state visit , the highlight of which was a state dinner scheduled at the White House for the evening .
But the visit was never going to go as smoothly as Hu would have liked .
The Democratic leader in the Senate , Harry Reid , was provocative , describing Hu on as "" a dictator "" .
Reid has refused to attend the state dinner .
The new Republican house speaker , John Boehner , also declined to attend .
Asked by a reporter about their absences , Hu said it was a matter for Obama .
Hu , as a sweetener to the US , came bearing gifts in the shape of $ 45bn ( £ 28bn ) in trade deals , almost half of which came in a promise to buy Boeing aircraft ."
2011-01-19,"Barack Obama did not duck differences over human rights when he welcomed the Chinese president today at the start of a lavish state visit .
In a brief appearance with Hu Jintao on the White House lawn , Obama said that countries prospered when they respected basic human rights . ""
History shows that societies are more harmonious , nations are successful and the world is more just when the rights and responsibilities of all nations and all people are upheld , including the universal rights of every human being , "" he said .
Hu said co - operation between the US and China should be based on mutual respect , and the two countries should respect each other 's interests and development paths .
He also said he hoped his visit would "" open a new chapter in co - operation as partners "" .
But the pointed comments on mutual respect suggested limits to Obama 's ability to pressure the growing power on human rights .
Human rights groups have called on Obama to press Hu on the subject , urging the US president to "" publicly and privately "" demand the release of the jailed dissident and Nobel peace price laureate Liu Xiaobo and other activists .
The Chinese Human Rights Defenders network urged the US government to live up to its promises , citing Obama 's speech to the UN last autumn , which stressed that "" part of the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others ... this belief will guide America 's leadership "" .
Shang Baojun , Liu 's lawyer , said : "" I hope [ as a result of the visit ] the Sino - US relationship can be more stable and develop in a better direction .
"" I also hope changes and improvements can be made in certain areas , including human rights and the situation of prisoners of conscience , at least to create opportunities which will introduce a different voice to President Hu . ""
At the welcome ceremony today , Obama and Hu stood together on a podium as the US military played the Chinese and US national anthems .
There was a 21-gun salute ; the US having opted to accord Hu all the pomp and ceremony that it can .
In a short statement Obama welcomed Hu and looked back to a 1979 visit by China 's then vice - premier Deng Xiaoping , which helped open bilateral ties . ""
With this visit , we can lay the foundation for the next 30 years , "" Obama said , adding that co - operation was in each other 's interest .
"" We have an enormous stake in each other 's success , "" Obama said .
Hu , who rarely speaks other than from prepared scripts , will face questions at a joint press conference at the White House with Obama later today .
There will be two questions from American reporters and two from Chinese .
Hu 's movements will to be dogged by pro - Tibetan demonstrators , human rights groups and others throughout his four - day visit .
Demonstrators protested outside the White House today but were kept back from the ceremony .
They are planning further demonstrations throughout the day , including a candlelit vigil outside the White House state dinner tonight , and will follow the Chinese leader to Chicago later this week .
Hu arrived in Washington last night for the start of the visit .
Obama held a small dinner for him at the White House before the state dinner tonight .
It is their eighth meeting since Obama became president two years ago , an indication of the importance of Beijing to the US .
Little of substance is expected from the Obama - Hu meeting but the US hopes that by pulling out all the stops for the Chinese leader a working relationship can be established for the future .
Washington needs China 's help in tackling US and global economic problems and in trying to resolve international disputes ranging from North Korea to Iran ."
2011-01-19,"Campaigners for human rights in China today called on Barack Obama to press Hu Jintao on the issue during the Chinese president 's state visit .
They also urged the US president to "" publicly and privately "" demand the release of the jailed dissident and Nobel peace price laureate Liu Xiaobo and other activists .
The Chinese Human Rights Defenders network urged the US government to live up to its own promises , citing Obama 's speech to the UN last autumn , which stressed that "" part of the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others ... this belief will guide America 's leadership "" .

"" I also hope changes and improvements can be made in certain areas , including human rights and the situation of prisoners of conscience , at least to create opportunities which will introduce a different voice to President Hu . ""
Feng Zhenghu , a dissident who was not allowed back into China at the time Obama visited in 2009 , although he has since been able to return , said : "" I do n't really have many expectations of his trip to the US this time .
It is not pessimism , just realism .
"" I think the topics will mainly be about economic and trade issues .
As a citizen of the country , I care more about other things .
It is not realistic to hope that a state visit can bring much change in those areas , so I do n't have high expectations . ""
However , although Hu and Obama are scheduled to have one to one talks in the Oval Office later today , human rights and other concerns , which have made relations between the two nations delicate , will be sidelined for most of the first full day of a four - day state visit .
The US is putting out the flags for the major visit by the head of an equal – and by some measures greater – superpower .
Hu formally welcomed with an arrival ceremony , lunch at the State Department and a full state banquet at the White House , reciprocating the formality of Obama 's state visit to Beijing in 2009 .
Human rights activists are determined that the plight of China 's dissidents must not be ignored amid the diplomatic niceties .
Placard - carrying protesters turned up outside the White House , although their presence was cut from news reports shown in China .
On his last visit , in 2006 , Hu had a working White House lunch with President George Bush – something seen by the Chinese as a grave insult .
Since then , China 's economy has grown to the extent that Hu and Obama now meet as equals .
According to some analysts , China may already have overtaken the US in terms of the absolute size of its economy .
It is lending more to developing countries than the World Bank , according to the Financial Times , and its armed forces – the 2.2 million soldiers of the People 's Liberation Army – are the biggest in the world .
US exports to China , at $ 81.8bn ( £ 51.17bn ) , are dwarfed by the $ 344.1bn the US imports .
China is mounting a public relations offensive coinciding with the visit , including an image of the Chinese basketball star Yao Ming towering over Times Square on a giant advertising screen ."
2011-01-19,"The state visit by China 's president , Hu Jintao , to the US was today overshadowed by Beijing 's poor record on human rights , with Barack Obama twice referring to the matter in public .
The US president spoke about a need to recognise human rights during a ceremony on the White House lawn to welcome Hu at the start of his state visit , and again during a joint press conference .
The move indicates a toughening approach by Obama towards China after strained relations during the last 12 months over North Korea , Iran , the strength of the Chinese economy , and other issues .
Obama also called on China to engage in talks about Tibet with the Dalai Lama , saying he had been candid in his talks with Hu .
He said that while he recognised the US and China were at different stages of development , there were fundamental values such as freedom of speech , religion and assembly that transcended culture .
Hu , who normally sticks to delivering speeches , faced a rare unscripted moment in the press conference .
Asked by a US reporter about human rights , Obama gave a lengthy reply but Hu embarrassingly refused to answer .
Later at the press conference , another US reporter asked Hu why he had not answered the human rights question .
Hu laughed and blamed a problem in translation , saying he had not realised the question was aimed at him , but he would now answer it .
He said China was committed to the protection of human rights and had made enormous progress in this area which had been recognised around the world .
China was prepared to engage in dialogue with the US but based on mutual respect and non - interference in domestic politics .
Obama had dealt directly with China 's poor human rights record . ""
History shows that societies are more harmonious , nations are more successful and the world is more just when the rights and responsibilities of all nations and all people are upheld , including the universal rights of every human being , "" Obama said .

He added that the Chinese side had done everything it could to avoid such embarrassment .
Obama is taking a risk , given that the US regards China as its top foreign policy concern , especially with its dependence on China to help revive the US economy .
Hu , as a sweetener to the US , came bearing gifts in the shape of $ 45bn ( £ 28bn ) in trade deals , almost half of which came in a promise to buy Boeing aircraft .
The White House said that Obama , who won the Nobel peace prize in 2009 , had planned to push Hu in private to release Liu Xiaobo , the dissident and 2010 Nobel peace prize - winner , and to discuss the fate of other political prisoners .
Pro - Tibet groups and others plan to follow Hu throughout his visit to Washington and later in the week to Chicago .
Outside the White House and out of the hearing of Hu , about 200 people shouted "" Killer , killer Hu Jintao "" .
They expected their numbers to double later for the carrying of a coffin round the White House to symbolise the death of the Chinese Communist party .
Tensin Dolkar , a Tibetan - American and one of the leaders of the Students for a Free Tibet group , welcomed Obama 's comments but added : "" We hope that Obama will also raise Tibet because it is central to human rights . ""
She said there were 800 known political prisoners in Tibet .
Elizabeth Economy , director of Asia studies at the US - based Council on Foreign Relations , said that Obama 's remark would not necessarily be interpreted as a snub by Hu . ""

2011-01-20,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , today received a sceptical and hostile reception when he visited the US Congress .
Both Republicans and Democrats attacked China 's human rights record and alleged currency manipulation at America 's expense , and accused Beijing of bullying its neighbours .
Hu held private meetings with John Boehner , the House Speaker , and the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , both of whom rejected invitations to the state dinner for the Chinese leader last night .
The Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell , also turned down an invitation to the dinner .
The only member of the Congressional "" big four "" to attend was the Democratic leader in the House and former Speaker , Nancy Pelosi .
The chilly reception on Capitol Hill contrasted with Hu 's day at the White House yesterday , where Barack Obama pressed the Chinese leader on human rights but otherwise emphasised common ground .
Reid – the most powerful Democrat in Congress – referred to Hu as a "" dictator "" in an interview on Tuesday .
He made a half - hearted retraction yesterday , saying : "" Maybe I should n't have said ' dictator , ' but they have a different type of government than we have – and that is an understatement .
"" Members of the House and Senate have expressed anger towards China over the strength of its currency – which they claim is being deliberately manipulated by Beijing – and threatened punitive measures .
The House foreign affairs committee held a meeting yesterday to coincide with Hu 's visit to the White House .
Among those at the meeting was Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher , who told CNN that Hu 's China was "" a gangster regime that murders its own people "" .
In a separate interview , Rohrabacher described the Chinese government as "" Nazis "" .
More than 80 members of Congress have signed a letter saying US patience with the currency dispute is exhausted , and more than 30 signed a separate letter calling for the release of the Chinese dissident and Nobel peace prizewinner Liu Xiaobo .
Sherrod Brown , a Democratic senator , said he would join the Republican senator Olympia Snowe to propose legislation to allow US companies to seek higher duties on some Chinese goods to compensate for China 's built - in currency advantage .
Although Pelosi attended the state dinner , her office issued a statement critical of China . ""
Since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 , there has been bipartisan concern in the Congress about the human rights situation in China and Tibet , the support of the Chinese government for rogue states , and China 's unfair trade practices , which have ballooned our trade deficit from $ 5bn a year to $ 5bn a week , "" she said .
John McCain , one of the Republicans due to meet Hu , told Reuters before the meeting : "" I will emphasise that China can not be a major influence in the world and abuse human rights .
They have not met our expectations and the predictions of many . """
2011-01-20,"Chinese state media have lauded Hu Jintao 's trip to Washington but downplayed remarks on human rights that led reports elsewhere in the world .
Headlines in China today hailed "" a new chapter in relations "" and even "" a historic masterstroke of China - US diplomacy "" .
The state broadcaster CCTV focused on the welcoming ceremony and trade agreements , not mentioning human rights in reports seen by the Guardian .
In a front - page commentary in the overseas edition of the People 's Daily , the main Communist party newspaper , Sino - US relations expert Tao Wenzhao wrote that common interests between China and the US should supersede their differences . ""
The region 's peace , stability and prosperity are beneficial to both countries .
The countries in the region can also share the benefits , "" wrote the Tsinghua university professor .
"" If military conflict , turmoil or economic recession develop in the region , it will benefit no one . ""
The Xinhua state news agency reported the Chinese president 's comments on human rights from the press conference , where he said China "" is always committed to protection and promotion of human rights and has made enormous progress in this regard "" .
But the story appeared to be buried on news websites .
There was no mention of the question that prompted the president 's reply or of the US president 's comments .
Although Chinese leaders rarely discuss human rights in public , Hu Jintao 's remarks were broadly in line with previous statements on the issue .
Residents in Beijing said screens went blank when BBC and CNN broadcasts – available in some hotels and upmarket apartment complexes – discussed human rights and protests .
Many in China were keen to discuss Barack Obama 's remarks and the fact he raised the case of the jailed Nobel peace prize winner , Liu Xiaobo .
On Twitter – blocked in China but accessed by some users including many activists – one widely retweeted comment read : "" American officials say Obama has raised the Liu Xiaobo issue with Hu and Obama reiterated that freedom of speech is a universal right .
But the official refused to say how Hu answered the question . ""
Another user wrote : "" Imagine : When Obama asked about Liu Xiaobo , Hu began to look confused and asked his assistant : who is Liu Xiaobo ?
He is challenging Wen [ Jiabao ] to be the best actor ! ""
Chinese cynics have long argued that premier Wen 's man - of - the - people persona is merely an act .
A third said : "" Obama raises the human rights issue and Hu immediately spent US$ 45bn [ on deals ] .
Speechless ...
"" Some in China see US pressure over human rights as hypocritical .
One student told Reuters : "" They are just using it as an excuse to attack China .
The US issues a global report on human rights every year , but never mentions itself in it .
Then China would release a similar report on the US the next day .
I think human rights in all countries have improved , but still have flaws .
Disparity is inevitable . """

As background to Chinese president Hu Jintao 's visit to Washington , we published an article comparing the status of China and the US in various fields ( Hard power meets soft power as China is finally granted equal status by US , 19 January , page 23 ) .
"" In absolute size , "" the piece said , China 's economy is catching up fast and , "" according to data compiled by the University of Pennsylvania , may even have overtaken the US at some point in the past year . ""
To clarify , these data , showing the size of China 's economy in 2010 being $ 14.8tn compared to $ 14.6tn for the US , were based on purchasing power parity ( PPP ) .
An alternative figure – the one most often cited – is reached by looking at GDP in current prices using market exchange rates .
Under that measurement , the IMF 's World Economic Outlook listings for 2009 – the most recent figures – give China 's GDP as $ 5tn and the US 's as $ 14tn .

2011-01-21,"Conservative radio hosts were not happy about the red carpet treatment afforded to China 's premier , Hu Jintao , on his state visit .
Rush Limbaugh Limbaugh was particularly concerned that we do n't appear to be spending too lavishly on the state visit , as we are already so indebted to China ( listen to clip and read transcript ) .
"" This dinner tonight better not be too opulent .
They better not go too overboard on this because Hu Jintao 's paying for this .
And if the regime goes overboard here with all kinds of opulence and expense , you know ,
Hu Jintao 's gon na say , ' This is not why we gave you the money .
I can get this at home . '
"" Limbaugh 's concerns were somewhat valid considering that China has more than doubled its holding of US treasury debt to almost $ 900bn since their last state visit in 2006 .
Still , it seems like a good idea to make Mr Hu feel welcome if we want to improve our relations with the world 's fastest - growing economy .
Much of the focus of the visit , however , has been on China 's human right 's abuses and Limbaugh does n't think much of Premier Hu 's stance on this issue .
You have to learn how to listen to the "" ChiComs "" .
When you hear Hu Jintao talk about "" mutual respect "" , what that means is …
It does not mean , "" We will bury you .
We will conquer you .
"" I 'm sure they already think that . ""
Mutual respect "" means , "" Shut the hell up about our human rights abuses !
Do n't talk to me about the Falun Gong .
I do n't want to hear it .
I do n't want to hear about Tibet .
Do n't even bring up the Dalai Lama .
We liked the fact you made him go out the back door next to the trash . ""
It 's interesting that Limbaugh , who famously dismissed the abuses at Abu Ghraib as fraternity boys merely letting off steam , is suddenly concerned about human rights .
But he was not impressed by Hu Jintao 's tepid response to a reporter 's question on this issue that China had much work to do in this area
but it was their business how they moved forward .
He told us to go to hell .
He told the media to go to hell .
He told Obama to go to hell .
"" We have a different version of human rights than you do .
What are you gon na do about it ?
You got your own problems .
"" We do , indeed , have our own problems , aside from the myriad of human rights abuses going on at Guantánamo Bay and in CIA secret prisons , even on US soil , American prisoners are subjected to extraordinarily harsh conditions , with around 80,000 in solitary confinement , sometimes denied sunlight and exercise , and the ACLU have reported incidents of prisoners being held in 3ftx3 ft metal cages with "" no bed , blanket or toilet "" .
Though this probably has nothing to do with Hu Jintao 's unwillingness to be drawn on the human rights issue .
Anyway , Limbaugh imagines the behind - the - scenes conversations between President Obama and Premier Hu are of a different nature .
In private , Hu Jintao is gon na say to Obama , "" Come on , now !
What 's more important , human rights or cheap iPhones and iPads ? ""
The ChiComs , they 're not gon na … .
I mean , they 'll go through the motions of letting us preach to them , but
in private ?
No doubt , Liu Xiaobo and other Chinese dissidents would be much better - off if Limbaugh were conducting US diplomacy with the "" ChiComs "" .
Laura Ingraham Laura Ingraham shared Limbaugh 's pessimism about China 's human rights record and the prospect of improved US - China relations ( listen to clip ) .
"" Who 's violating everyone 's civil rights ?
Who 's torturing dissidents ?
Who 's undervaluing his currency ?
Who 's manipulating the markets ?
Who 's giving his state - owned corporations huge subsidies to further subvert the United States ' economic position in the world ?
Who 's doing all that ?
Hu is . ""
She was n't happy , however , that there appeared to be more controversy about the failure of three of the four top dogs in Congress , John Boehner , Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell to attend the state dinner honouring Premier Hu , than the fact of the dinner itself .
Are you following me here , people ?
It 's not controversial that we have a state dinner for one of the biggest enemies of freedom out there .
It is controversial that the speaker of the house does n't go 99 degrees for him –
you know , bowing .
Ingraham appears to find it unseemly for a US president to be bowing to other world leaders .
Is he still saying he lost a contact that first time he bowed to the Saudi King ?
Back to the controversy at hand , she did n't have much to say about Harry Reid or Mitch McConnell , but she was n't happy about the apparent slight by outgoing press secretary Robert Gibbs against Boehner 's decision to skip dinner .
So , here 's what 's controversial : John Boehner , and the Gibbopotamaus [ Robert Gibbs , presumably ] yesterday in one of his parting shots from the Gibbopotamous pool … he decided to chime in again on the great assault against decency .
Not what the Chinese do to its people , but to what John Boehner did to the Chinese .
Actually , Gibbs did n't say a whole lot other than that "" we hope that – because of the importance of the relationship – that they would attend . ""
Either way , Ingraham viewed Boehner 's stand against the Chinese leader as testimony to his strong leadership qualities .
Boehner is up , up , up .
Guess what all these people who say , "" oh , he 's a blubber puss , oh , he 's crying too much .
"" I mean , I was kind of ribbing him for that as well , right .
John Boehner 's popularity is up because he 's taken a firm stand .
He said he 's going to go forward and do the people 's business .
They spent their days you know in reflection after the Gabby Giffords shooting , but he said , "" Look , this business is going to go on , "" and people love that .
Though , perhaps , attempting to engage with the leader of the world 's fastest - growing economy might have moved the "" people 's business "" a bit further along .
Michael Savage Michael Savage was also unimpressed by the administration 's kowtowing to regime that is "" mocking "" us ( listen to clip ) . ""
Well , the president of China is here .
He 's basically mocking the United States .
He 's used his junk yard dog Kim Jong - il to threaten us .
That 's the fellow from North Korea for those of you who do n't know who he is .
He [ Hu ] unveiled a stealth fighter plane just as our secretary of defence was visiting .
He attacked our own currency yesterday by saying a dollar - based system is a thing of the past .
Yet , here he comes to the US yesterday and Obama genuflects to him . ""
Savage stopped short of looking to military solutions to deal with the Chinese threat , however .
You know , you certainly do n't want to start a war with China over trade , but they 've started a war with us .
They 're trading us into the poor house .
It is the favourable conditions that enable China 's huge trade surplus that particularly bothered him .
Any lawyers in the house ?
How come you ca n't ply your tort trade in China ?
Because you 'd wind up in a concentration camp if you did .
If you crippled any of the businesses in China with false tort claims , with product liability claims , with workers compensation claims that are false , with EPA regulations with EEOC regs , you would not last too long in China .
In fact , in the past year in particular , China has made big strides in the area of tort laws and made moves to improve workers ' rights , but as Savage was unaware of this , he suggested the following solution .
Now , I would say that we could straighten out America 's economic problems rapidly .
Donald Trump actually agreed with me on one principal method , which is establish a 20 % tariff immediately on all Chinese goods !
Overnight , bingo :
20 % !
Well , it 's an approach that many people might be happy to try – though they might not be so happy if China stopped buying up our debt .
But you know , you certainly do n't want to start a war with China over trade .

2011-01-23,"When China 's President Hu Jintao came for his state visit last week , the White House press corps completely ignored almost all the substantive issues raised by Hu 's visit .
The domestic policy issues raised by this trip were altogether invisible in the reporting in major news outlets .
The news accounts were filled with the long list of items that President Obama was likely to raise with President Hu .
There are issues about China respecting the patents and copyrights of US firms .
The US has concerns about market access in China for our retailers , our financial firms and some of our manufactured products .
And then there are issues about the relative value of the dollar and yuan .
Yep , the White House press corps got together the whole list , presented it to the public , and then went home and had a drink .
If these reporters actually had to cover the news to get a paycheck , then this checklist of concerns would have been just the beginning of their job .
It 's great for the Obama administration to come up with a wishlist that it would like from China 's leadership .
But this is not Disney World .
China does n't hand the United States everything on its wishlist .
China is a superpower that does n't have to do whatever the United States wants .
It makes concessions to the United States in exchange for items on its own wishlist .
This means that the United States is not going to get everything on its list .
In fact , President Obama must decide which items he will prioritise with China and put these items first , as opposed to other items which he will tell Hu are of less consequence .
The real job of reporting in Washington last week should have been trying to find out the actual priority that President Obama was assigning to the various items on his list .
This is what the public needs to know : different items will obviously matter more to some people than others .
Most people in the United States probably do n't give a damn if the Chinese pay Bill Gates for making copies of MS Windows .
The public may even applaud if Chinese companies make unauthorised copies of Pfizer 's drugs , so that more people in China can afford the medicine they need to save their life .
They probably also do n't care much if China 's bureaucracy makes it difficult for Wal - Mart to expand or for Goldman Sachs to be a big player in China 's financial markets .
But most of the public really does have a very big interest in the value of the yuan against the dollar .
If the dollar is overvalued against the yuan by 30 % , then this has the same effect as the United States imposing a tariff of 30 % on the items that we may try to export to China .
It is pretty hard to export goods if you impose a 30 % tax on them .
On the other side , a currency that is overvalued by 30 % is equivalent to providing a subsidy to China 's manufacturers of 30 % for the goods that the United States imports from China .
A 30 % subsidy for imports gives them a very large advantage competing with US - made goods .
Not surprisingly , this overvaluation is making it very difficult for US manufacturers to compete with China .
The overvaluation of the dollar against the Chinese yuan ( and other currencies ) is the main reason for the huge US trade deficit .
It is also one of the main reasons that the country has lost 6 million manufacturing jobs in the last dozen years .
The loss of relatively well - paying manufacturing jobs has put downward pressure on the wages of large segments of the US workforce .
It is one of the main factors behind the growth of inequality in the United States in the last three decades .
So , we know that the value of the yuan was one of the items on President Obama 's wishlist , but we do not know how high up it was on the list .
Did President Obama tell President Hu that he does n't care about Microsoft and Pfizer and Wal - Mart and Goldman ; he just wants to see the dollar fall against the yuan ?
Or did Obama tell Hu that he would like to see the yuan rise against the dollar , but he understands the problems that this would create in China .
Instead , Obama may have suggested that Hu do more to protect Pfizer 's patents and swing a few more deals to Goldman .
The fact is that the public has no clue as to what the Obama administration 's priorities were in negotiating with China – because the media made no effort to find out .
It somehow escaped the White House press corps , but the deals with China are , first and foremost , about battles over domestic policy .
President Obama either pushed for Goldman Sachs or he pushed for the nation 's workers , but it does n't make sense that he pushed for both .
The media , apparently , are not going to tell the American people which side the President chose .
Fortunately , the currency markets will ."
2011-02-21,"The United Nations will call on Monday for 2 % of worldwide income to be invested in the green economy , a move it says would boost jobs and economic growth .
The call is expected to be matched by statements of support for low - carbon investment from heads of state including President Barack Obama of the US and Hu Jintao of China , and several chiefs of multinational companies .
An investment of 2 % of global GDP would more than pay for itself in the form of millions of new jobs , the development of new industries , health benefits from cleaner air , energy efficiency savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , the UN is expected to say .
These findings are also backed up by a report to be published today by the German government , which warns that Europe will suffer continued low growth rates unless investment in green projects is increased .
Raising the level of ambition in the EU 's climate targets would increase European GDP by up to $ 842bn , a 6 % rise , and create up to 6 m additional jobs across member states .
The world stands at a critical point in terms of low - carbon investment , according to the UN .
While India has a national action plan expected to stimulate $ 1tn of investment in the next decade , and China - already the biggest producer of wind power and solar panels - is pushing ahead with a five - year plan for a "" clean revolution "" , other economies are wavering .
In the US , investment in renewable energy has stalled , and an HSBC analysis found that Republican plans currently before Congress would more than halve federal spending on low - carbon projects , including high - speed rail , carbon regulation and contributions to international climate funds .
Plans put forward by Obama , by contrast , provide for a 20 % increase in climate and clean energy funding above 2010 levels , paid for by the repeal of $ 4bn in fossil fuel subsidies and research .
Nick Robins , head of climate change at HSBC , said : "" We expect tough negotiations to close this gulf in budgetary priorities between the president and Congress ...
Although we do not expect all the proposed cuts to materialise , key climate initiatives look set to be curbed .
"" In the European Union , politicians , green campaigners and businesses are at loggerheads over whether to adopt more ambitious climate targets .
Several member states , including the UK , want to toughen the current goal of cutting emissions by 20 % by 2020 to a cut of 30 % by the same date , arguing that a more stringent target will create new jobs and allow the EU to keep up with China in the race to dominate the green economy .
Their case was strongly boosted by a confidential European Commission analysis , seen by the Guardian , showing that if existing policies are followed through , the EU will comfortably exceed its current target , with a fall in emissions of about 25 % by 2020 .
The German environment ministry 's report , also seen by the Guardian , added to this case , concluding that the current 20 % target "" has become too weak to mobilise innovations "" .
Sticking with it , the authors say , "" is the equivalent of digging deeper while still being stuck in a hole "" , while the 30 % target is not only achievable but "" economically beneficial "" .
In the UK , a group of leading businesses will unite today to urge George Osborne , the chancellor , to include measures to stimulate low - carbon development in his March Budget .
Peter Young , chairman of the Aldersgate Group , said : "" The chancellor has promised a budget for growth but we believe this must be a budget for green growth .
The UK needs an explicit strategy to take advantage of the global shift to a green economy , driving jobs and exports .
Cuts alone will not deliver a competitive economy . """
2011-07-01,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , warned that the Communist party was still suffering from corruption and other "" growing pains "" as the 90-year - old organisation celebrated its anniversary in lavish style at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing .
In a highly choreographed event that was broadcast live across the nation , Hu lauded the achievements of the venerable and vast political party but emphasised the need for greater internal discipline .
His message was partly overshadowed by the mysterious absence of his predecessor , Jiang Zemin , from the lineup of senior cadres .
"" If corruption does not get solved effectively , the party will lose the people 's trust and support .
The entire party should stay alert and fully appreciate the long - term complexity and arduousness of the fight against corruption , and make more efforts in fighting corruption and building a clean government , "" Hu said .
Corruption is endemic .
Revelations of bribery , influence peddling and misuse of public funds are a regular staple of the domestic media .
Among the most recent cases was the sacking of the railway minister , Liu Zhijun , who was accused of taking 1bn yuan ( £ 95 m ) .
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that 800bn yuan ( £ 76bn ) was transferred overseas by officials and executives who later fled the country .
Far more is likely to have been squirrelled away or lavished on banquets , second homes and lovers inside China .
Hu gave little hope , however , to those seeking wider political reform that might curb the power of cadres , some of whom he acknowledged were "" incompetent "" and "" divorced from the people "" .
Instead of radical change , he said , the party needed more internal democracy .
His comments reflect the transformation of the Chinese Communist party , which started in 1921 as a revolutionary organisation with a dozen founders , and is now a technocracy with 80 million members and distinctly aristocratic tendencies .
Many senior cadres - large numbers of whom are now the "" princeling "" sons and daughters of former leaders - use party connections for self - enrichment in an increasingly divided society .
Lacking an electoral mandate , the party has built its legitimacy on managerial competence and national strength , particularly with economic growth and engineering prowess .
This week 's political celebrations have coincided with the unveiling of three mega - projects : the world 's longest sea bridge , which spans the 16 miles ( 26 km ) from Qingdao to Huangdao ; the world 's longest gas pipeline , which stretches 5,400 miles ( 8,700 km ) from Xingjiang to Guangzhou ; and a new high - speed railway , which cuts the travelling time between Beijing and Shanghai to less than five hours .
In the runup to its own birthday this week , the party has also ramped up the propaganda volume with a series of high - profile events , including a "" Red Song "" contest in Chongqing that reportedly drew 100,000 people , the premiere of a star - studded historical drama about the founding years , and lavish TV galas .
State media have run extensive special issues highlighting the successes of the party in ejecting foreign colonialists , taking power under Mao Zedong in 1959 , lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty and maintaining stability .
Little or no mention has been made of the party 's failings , including famines that killed tens of millions of people after the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s , the murderous political chaos of the Cultural Revolution , and the massacre of several hundred protesters after the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989 .
Hu only said lessons had been learned . ""
In some historical periods , we once made mistakes and even suffered severe setbacks , the root cause of which was that our guiding thought then was divorced from China 's reality .
Our party managed to correct the mistakes by the strength of itself and the people , rose up amid the setbacks and continued to go forward victoriously , "" he told the thousands of senior cadres gathered inside the Great Hall of the People .
The biggest surprise was the non - appearance of the former president and party leader Jiang Zemin , prompting speculation of illness or a rift within the higher echelons of the party .
The former is more likely , given that Jiang is 84 , but he also represents a different strand of opinion about the future direction of the party and the nation .
Internal party debates are carried out behind closed doors , but there has long been a divide between those like Jiang on the "" right "" who favour more deregulation , opening and market reform and those on the "" new left "" who favour a more interventionist , egalitarian and authoritarian approach .
Hu was seen as being closer to the former when he took power in 2002 , but he has spent much of his time as state president and party secretary straddling the two camps ."
2011-07-06,"Even for China 's rigorous internet censors , it has proved an unusually busy day .
References to rivers and laundry are among the apparently innocuous items vanishing from postings and search results amid rumours that Jiang Zemin , who led the country before president Hu Jintao took over in 2002 , is dead or seriously ill .
Similar tales have circulated several times in the past .
This time they seem to have been prompted by the 84-year - old 's absence from celebrations for the 90th anniversary of the Communist party on Friday .
He is normally a staple of such events and other former leaders were shown at the gathering .
Sina , which runs a wildly popular microblog service , went to increasing lengths to keep the topic off - limits .
Searches for the leader 's name , or even just for "" jiang "" – river – resulted in the warning : "" Search results are not shown due to relevant laws and policies . ""
They even began to remove one of the cheekiest references to Jiang : an empty set of clothes hanging up , with the trousers hitched to Simon Cowell - level .
The former leader is known for his high waistline .
But some internet users began posting about a leader called "" River "" , using the English word .
The lengths to which authorities are going are all the more striking because Jiang 's death would be unlikely to cause major ripples .
"" We are not going to see a palace coup of any sort , "" said Steve Tsang of the University of Nottingham , an expert on succession in China .
"" We are not going to see a leadership change as a result of Jiang Zemin 's passing away and we are not going to see a major reversal in any major policy . ""
Two Hong Kong television stations have reported that Jiang has died , citing unidentified sources .
The Wall Street Journal 's website reported that Sina had also blocked searches for words such as "" myocardial infarction "" , "" hung "" – a euphemism for death – and "" 301 Hospital "" – a reference to the medical facility that often treats top leaders .
Chinese internet users have become increasingly adept at evading censorship , often using images , analogies , Roman script and puns .
But David Bandurski , of the University of Hong Kong 's China Media Project , said censorship ghettoises discussions , so that they do not spread beyond small groups of people who recognise the relevant code words .
Chinese officials still "" want to control the conversation as ultimately as they can , "" he said ."
2011-10-27,"China has welcomed news of the debt deal but offered little hint of what role it might play , with an early warning that emerging economies should not be regarded as Europe 's "" Good Samaritans "" .
French president Nicolas Sarkozy telephoned his Chinese counterpart , Hu Jintao , on Thursday to promote the agreement and discuss the upcoming G20 summit .
Klaus Regling , head of the European Financial Stability Facility –
the bailout fund – will try to sell the plan to leaders in Beijing on Friday .
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said China welcomed the agreement by European leaders , but was vague in response to questions about whether China would be involved .
"" We hope that this consensus ... is conducive to boosting market confidence , "" she said .
"" China is ready to work with the international community to promote stability in the international financial market and world economic recovery and growth . ""
An editorial carried by state news agency
Xinhua warned : "" While China and other emerging countries indicated they wo n't be bystanders of the eurozone crisis , it would be unfair to ask them to shoulder the same responsibility as those directly responsible for the crisis .
Emerging economies should not be seen as the EU 's Good Samaritans – in the end , the EU has to pull itself out of the crisis .
"" It is thought that the primary request may be for China to invest in a special purpose vehicle for distressed debt .
A Brussels - based Chinese diplomat told Reuters that his country had always "" done its bit "" and would continue to do so , but added : "" With regard to the special - purpose vehicle , there is nothing concrete and detailed . ""
China has good reason to support the European economy : the EU is its largest trading partner , and vice versa .
In July , China supplied 17 % of Europe 's imports .
But leaders have played down expectations that it will step in to buy up vast amounts of sovereign debt .
Beijing has preferred the lowest risk investments and is likely to be extremely cautious .
Leaders face public pressure at home , where many are likely to question a decision to help relatively wealthy countries with unstable economies .
"" China will not want to do too much at this point , "" said Professor Dai Bingran , director of the Centre for European Studies at Fudan University .
"" This is a temporary solution ...
In the long run , these countries really need to solve their problems themselves . ""
He said that it made sense to diversify China 's foreign exchange reserves , which remain heavily invested in US treasury bonds , but that Beijing would be willing to do so only if bonds were guaranteed by the eurozone as a whole .
Earlier this month Jin Liqun , chairman of the sovereign wealth fund 's board of supervisors , said it would take "" a market approach "" to Europe . ""
The key point for China is that maybe the markets remain a little dubious about the whole rescue plan , particularly until they see the details laid out , "" said Duncan Innes - Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing .
"" I think the only way European leaders are going to be able to get around that is by allowing China to go in under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund ...
How the details of that work in practice remains to be seen .
"" A statement from the summit said the EFSF would cooperate more closely with the IMF .
Alistair Thornton , of IHS Global Insight 's Beijing team , said even a definite Chinese commitment "" is not going to be a game - changer "" .
"" It will extend the deadline but not resolve the problem , "" he said .
Thornton added : "" They will want something in return .
It will build their case for a greater say in international financial organisations , most likely the IMF ...
But it will be hard for them to extract grand concessions if they have not done that much . ""
Others suggest that Beijing will use a contribution as leverage in its campaign for Europe to grant China market economy status , an appeal renewed last month by premier Wen Jiabao ."
2011-10-27,"It 's a measure of how desperate the eurozone 's plight has become that instead of cooing at his new baby , Nicolas Sarkozy will spend this afternoon on the phone to Beijing , trying to persuade China 's president Hu Jintao to stump up some cash for the euro - bailout .
Any deal was better than no deal last night ; but in the cold light of day , the question of why China would want to get involved in bankrolling the eurozone 's unmanageable debts was just one of the questions emerging .
Another was the size of the bailout fund .
Even assuming the participation of China and any other investors who can be persuaded to join in , and a whizzy new insurance scheme for sovereign debts , the über - EFSF will be worth € 1tn ( £ 875bn ) .
Angela Merkel and her colleagues are hoping that by offering insurance on new government debts from Italy , Spain and other troubled countries , they can make the fund 's resources go much farther .
But that depends on private investors being confident that this insurance fund will pay out .
As Karen Ward , of HSBC puts it , "" is the insurance credible ?
If the economic circumstances arose that would mean a large sovereign is struggling to meet its commitment ( either economic or political collapse ) , would core economies honour their commitment ?
"" If this insurance option does n't work , the firepower of the EFSF may not be nearly large enough to contain the fallout from Greece 's partial default .
There was also much in last night 's deal to show that banks , and their mindset , still have a stranglehold on the way Europe runs its economic affairs .
In order to persuade bondholders ( mainly banks ) to agree to a € 100bn "" haircut "" on the Greek debts they hold – one of the sticking points that kept the talks going late into the night – eurozone governments were forced to promise up to € 30bn in sweeteners , or "" credit enhancements "" .
It 's not yet clear how these sweeteners will work , and the talks with investors over the details will go on for weeks .
But the banks have effectively been able to dictate the terms , because everyone is desperate to avoid a so - called "" credit event "" , which would trigger many billions of pounds ' worth of credit default swaps and other complex bets between financial institutions , potentially destabilising the entire banking sector .
The eurocrats have also taken a leaf out of the banks ' books by planning to set up a new "" special purpose investment vehicle "" ( "" spiv "" for short , oh dear ) , as part of the rescue package .
It 's not yet clear exactly how it will work , but it 's expected to hold some of the dodgy debts of "" impaired "" nations such as Portugal and Greece , and fund itself by issuing bonds to investors – including , hopefully , the Chinese .
But anyone who has seen the play Enron will find it hard not to be reminded of the raptors .
Raptor was the name given by chief financial officer Andy Fastow to one of the special purpose vehicles he used to hide some of the Texas company 's monster losses , represented on stage by rapacious dinosaurs which , of course , later come back to bite him ."
2011-11-16,"Strains between China and the United States look set to overshadow a key Asian summit later this week after Barack Obama unveiled plans to station troops in Australia and step up Washington 's commitment to the entire Asia - Pacific region .
Amid growing tensions over the oil - rich South China Sea , China 's foreign ministry questioned the need for the US to strengthen military alliances , and the state media accused Washington of making a grab for assets .
Beijing 's unease has also been heightened by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's insistence that the South China Sea issue be included as a topic for discussion at the east Asia summit in Manila , which will be attended by President Obama , President Hu Jintao of China and other regional leaders .
China had requested that the sensitive issue be omitted .
Ahead of the summit Obama made a whirlwind 27-hour visit to Australia , where he and Julia Gillard , the prime minister , announced that from next year 250 marines will be stationed in the Northern Territory , rotating in and out of Darwin for around six months at a time .
Over the next few years this will build to a force of 2,500 US personnel .
In the last year the Pentagon has also negotiated wider access to military facilities in Vietnam , Singapore and the Philippines , prompting fears in Beijing that it is engaged in a policy of encirclement , as well as becoming involved in the row over waters in the South China Sea , which are claimed by several nations . ""
The United States is also trying to get involved in a number of regional maritime disputes , some of which concern China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , "" a commentary from China 's official Xinhua news agency said .
The Global Times , a Communist party paper , said the Philippines , aided and abetted by the US , was intent on "" grabbing resources from Chinese water "" .
Obama insisted , however , that the US was not attempting to isolate China . ""
We welcome a rising , peaceful China , "" he said .
But he claimed that there will be times when Beijing does not play by the rules and the US will send a "" clear message that they need to be on track in accepting the rules and responsibilities that come with being a world power "" .
The troop announcement comes on the 60th anniversary of the Australia - New - Zealand - United - States ( Anzus ) defence treaty , which binds the three countries to assist each other if attacked .
As well as new troops , the US air force will also have greater access to Australian air bases and there will be more frequent flights of US aircraft in and out of northern Australia .
"" Our alliance is going to be indispensable to our shared future and the security we need and the prosperity we seek , not only here but around the world , "" Obama said .
But it was questioned by China 's foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin . ""
Whether strengthening and expanding a military alliance is in the common interests of the region 's countries and the international community is worthy of discussion , "" he said .
China , he said , stood for peaceful development and co - operation .
"" We also believe that the external policies of countries in the region should develop along these lines , "" Liu told a news briefing in Beijing .
Dr James Curran , senior lecturer in history at Sydney University , said this new deployment would help to assuage some of the US allies in the region about China 's increasing power .
"" This is a very strong statement that the US is in the region to stay , "" he said ."
2011-12-30,"This has been a tragic year for dictators .
Gaddafi and Kim Jong - il are dead , Mubarak and Ben Ali ousted .
In Yemen , Saleh is neither obviously in power nor out ; Assad and Putin face stiff pressure and Hu Jintao will step aside peacefully , sustaining the party 's power but not his own .
More successfully , the Saudi and Bahraini royal families have bought off resistance at least for now .
Is there something in the air or is there something systematic behind the fall of so many dictators ?
Will 2012 see more of the same ?
To understand why dictators fall it helps to recognise factors that produce a perfect anti - dictatorial storm .
Barring missteps such as those that led to Gaddafi 's undoing , a dictator 's survival can be at risk because of newness in office , poor health or old age combined with economic trouble .
Give people a bit more freedom and there is bound to be trouble .
Dictators , unlike democrats , depend on a small coterie to sustain their power .
These backers , generally drawn from the military , the senior civil service , and family or clan members , have a synergistic relationship with their dictator .
The dictator delivers opportunities for them to become rich and they protect him from being overthrown .
To meet his end of the bargain , the dictator must know where the money is and how to ensure that it flows to these essential backers .
The money 's delivery is at risk if the dictator is new ( and so does n't know where the money is ) or is so old or unwell that he can not be considered a long - term source of support .
Equally dangerous is a lack of money produced by an economy struggling with high unemployment , especially when concentrated among relatively well - educated people .
These are the folks who must be kept happy enough that they do n't organise a vocal opposition .
With a global economic downturn , falling oil prices , and lots of old and sick dictators , 2011 provided a great opportunity for political change .
The coming year is likely to see the consolidation of power by some successor governments , few real shifts to democracy , and more turmoil in Syria , Russia and maybe Venezuela ( where Chavez is rumoured to be terminally ill ) or elderly Raul Castro 's Cuba .
North Korea 's Kim Jong - un could suffer in 2012 from not knowing where the money is , but that is unlikely .
In Kim Jong - un 's case we are more likely to see the effectiveness of dynastic dictatorship .
Kim Jong - il surely entrusted his son with knowledge of where the money is .
However ill - prepared Kim Jong - un is for leadership , if he knows where the money is he will do just fine .
Assad 's Syria faced high unemployment and declining revenue from limited oil reserves .
Shortage of money can be a formula for rebellion and reform but Assad has found new money in a bailout from Iran , Iraq and Venezuela .
They are pumping billions of pounds into his regime , giving him the money to assure the senior military – just about all of them from his Alawite ruling coalition – that he can take care of them at least for now .
Should the money run dry , then either Assad will liberalise or someone else will replace him and do so .
The greatest puzzle is Gaddafi 's blundering in Libya after more than four decades in power .
Maybe he believed his own propaganda and thought the people actually loved him .
In his final few years he educated the people better than in neighbouring states – even though he did n't need an educated labour force given Libya 's huge oil wealth .
He even cut back on torture , perhaps to curry favour with Europe and the US .
And he granted some press freedom .
This set the stage for anti - government factions to coordinate a rebellion , further fuelled by the contagious impact of seeing revolution succeed in the neighbourhood .
Sadly , there is nothing about Libya 's economy or the structure of its rebellion to inspire confidence in liberalisation and democratisation .
More likely , the new Libyan regime will differ from Gaddafi 's only in who it represses and abuses .
As for Russia and China , they are likely to continue to muddle through .
Only a collapse in oil prices is likely to produce real change in Russia .
China may be moving towards uprising or fundamental internal political change .
As the people in the coastal provinces grow rich they also grow restive and want a greater say in what happens to their wealth .
The people in the poor western and northern provinces are growing impatient – in their case with their failure to share in China 's growing wealth .
This is a combustible combination that eventually is likely to produce big change .
It would be wise to watch for signs of rebellion kindling in 2012 ."
2012-01-27,"Sleek and glinting in the sun , combining a traditional office tower with a more unusual spherical conference centre , shaped like a flying saucer , the new African Union ( AU ) headquarters in Addis Ababa , the Ethiopian capital , is an impressive symbol of modernity .
Some , however , harbour mixed feelings towards the complex , which is scheduled to be opened by President Hu Jintao on Saturday , the eve of the AU summit .
Why was it , they ask , that the 20-storey main office building and conference centre , which can seat more than 2,500 people , was built by a Chinese company with Chinese labour , rather than by Africans ?
The new AU building , the physical embodiment of China 's complex links with the continent , is thus both a source of pride and reproach for Africans .
"" It 's a beautiful , beautiful building full of grandeur and it will save a lot of money because it will help in the co - ordination of the AU 's business , "" said Michael Orwa , a project co - ordinator for State of the Union ( Sotu ) , a group of NGOs that wants the AU to live up to its rhetoric of unity and progress .
"" It 's a shame the AU was not able to build it itself . ""
China has made its presence felt throughout Africa , building a bridge in Niamey , Niger , constructing a "" super - highway "" in Nairobi , Kenya , digging for oil and minerals from South Sudan to Zambia , and flooding the continent with cheap goods .
The last of these activities is a source of concern to officials at the African Development Bank ( AfDB ) . ""
Cheap Chinese goods cause a lot of damage , "" said Gerald Ajumbo , principal trade officer at the AfDB .
"" They hurt consumers as they can be substandard – a battery with a very short battery life , for example .
They hurt producers , who lose market share .
And they have an impact on government revenues , as governments do not collect tax on these goods .
"" There is suspicion that China is dumping its goods in Africa , but so far no African governments have made any official complaint to the World Trade Organisation , the trade watchdog .
This may be because such cases are complex and costly to pursue , because governments do not want to offend a powerful benefactor , or – more likely – both .
AfDB economists bemoan the lack of competitiveness and productivity of Africa 's private sector , reproaching private companies for their reluctance to invest and reliance on governments to do so instead .
One way to boost competitiveness and productivity , they say , is to increase trade between African countries – precisely the theme of the AU summit .
Most African exports are still sent to markets in industrialised countries ; only 10 - 12 % go to other African countries .
This is less than half the level in other emerging markets , and half the continent 's intra - regional trade occurs within the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , dominated by South Africa .
The AU has set an ambitious timetable of 2017 to realise a Cape - to - Cairo free trade zone encompassing 26 countries , 525 million people and $ 1tn in output .
It is a grand plan and , given the precarious nature of the global economy , a timely one .
"" It is a good time to increase intra - Africa trade and generate badly - needed jobs , "" said Alex Rugamba , director for regional integration and trade at the AfDB .
"" There is a huge opportunity at a summit like this ; much depends on the leaders gathered here to provide the momentum for us footsoldiers .
"" There has been some progress .
Two of Africa 's eight regional trading blocs , the Common Market for East and Southern Africa ( Comesa ) and the East African Community ( EAC ) , already have tariff- and quota - free trade .
Efforts have been made to cut down time at border crossings .
Zambia and Zimbabwe have reduced the time trucks spend at their border crossing at Chirundu from a week to three hours .
Work is progressing on a north - south highway between Durban , South Africa , and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania .
Free trade zones would also help deal with cheap Chinese products , since a tariff belt around African markets would have the effect of making Chinese goods more expensive .
A Cape to Cairo market sounds like a great idea for African producers and consumers .
For Orwa , the trick is to make it happen .
The proposed African grand free trade area , which would encompass 26 countries , 525 million people and $ 1tn , risks becoming another flight of fancy and rhetoric that goes unmatched by concrete actions .
Pointing to the looming humanitarian crisis in the Sahel , Orwa argues that if the African countries had lived up to their previous pledge of spending 10 % of their budget on agriculture , perhaps the continent would have achieved food security by now .
In another example of unfulfilled promise , he points to a failure to ratify and implement a protocol on a code of justice , creating an African version of the International Criminal Court .
If that had been the case , Kenya would not have suffered the humiliation of sending Kenyans to stand trial at the Hague .
"" We want the AU to go beyond trophy projects like this new headquarters , "" said Orwa .
"" We want the AU to ratify and implement policy declarations and instruments so that Africans can see tangible benefits .
We want an AU of the people , for the people and not just for states and leaders . """
2012-03-19,"Before last week 's National People 's Congress , Russian political analysts looked admiringly at the managed process of political change taking place in China .
One generation of leaders hands over to another this autumn as Premier Wen Jiabao and President Hu Jintao make way for their successors .
It will be the first transition that has not been shaped by the founders of the People 's Republic and it will decide who will run China for the next 10 years .
A transition run apparently so smoothly , when so much is at stake , is the envy of the Russian political elite .
But that was before Bo Xilai , the party secretary of Chongqing province , crashed to Earth .
Bo had intended to use a ruthless anti - crime crackdown in Chongqing as a vehicle to propel himself to one of nine coveted seats on the standing committee of the politburo , until his police chief , Wang Lijun , sought refuge in the American consulate in Chengdu , claiming that his life was under threat from Bo .
Bo 's coup de grace was delivered in person by the outgoing Premier Wen , as he warned that China risked another historical tragedy like the Cultural Revolution and that the Chongqing party had to "" seriously reflect "" on the incident .
A rubber - stamp parliament this was not .
But if the inner tensions of such a momentous transition had broken surface , what were they ?
And if this is the first public argument , will it be the last ?
Wen did not just aim his parting salvo at Bo , but at the authoritarian way in which reform was being managed , or stifled .
During a three - hour press conference , it was here that he displayed genuine passion .
Stalling or retreating from change offered no way out , he said .
Without successful political structural reform , the gains China had made in instituting structural economic reform might be lost .
Wen was only talking about at best incremental democratic change – elections for township and county officials only .
He can also be rightly accused of having failed to translate his liberal - sounding rhetoric into reality .
But he was , if anything , understating his case .
The next generation of leaders headed by Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang will not only inherit a China which is vastly more wealthy than the country that Hu Jintao took over a decade ago .
It is incomparably more unequal too .
As Bloomberg reported , the National People 's Congress 's 70 richest members added more to their wealth last year than the combined net worth of the US Congress , the president , his cabinet and supreme court justices .
The jostling for places on the standing committee will test Xi 's powers to impose his will .
China will not need technocrats but politicians who can communicate their vision beyond the party to the country as a whole .
The closer one looks at it , the more familiar the process becomes ."

2012-03-28,"A Tibetan exile who set himself on fire in Delhi earlier this week has died , as Indian police and paramilitaries launch a security crackdown to prevent further protests or self - immolations during the visit of the Chinese premier , Hu Jintao .
Jamphel Yeshi , 27 , suffered 90 % burns after dousing himself with petrol during a protest on Monday , and authorities fear that more Tibetans will follow suit to protest at Chinese policies in their homeland .
About 30 Tibetans have died and another dozen have been seriously injured in the past 13 months in similar protests , mainly inside China . ""
Martyr Jamphel Yeshi 's sacrifice will be written in golden letters in the annals of our freedom struggle , "" Dhondup Lhadar , an activist with the Tibetan Youth Congress , told the Associated Press . ""
He will live on to inspire and encourage the future generations of Tibetans . ""
Hu arrives in Delhi for a two - day summit of emerging nations , along with leaders from Brazil , Russia and South Africa .
Dharmendra Kumar , a senior police official , cited "" international security concerns "" to justify a ban on protests and press conferences by Tibetan activists in Delhi . ""
The law and order should n't deteriorate in the capital during the Brics summit , "" Kumar told the Hindustan Times .
Hundreds of armed security personnel patrolled areas of the Indian capital where Tibetans live on Wednesday , erecting barricades and refusing to let young people leave , but police spokesmen denied that thousands of Tibetans were under effective "" house arrest "" .
Rajan Bhagat of the Delhi police said : "" There is no confinement .
We are just keeping watch to make sure they are not coming into [ the area ] where the summit is happening . ""
Students of Tibetan origin have been confined to halls of residence and barred from meeting the media .
Tenzin Kalsang , 18 , said the police were escorting students at her hostel to and from classes .
"" When some students tried to protest .
… then the police visited each hostel room and told us : ' If you do not listen , then we will put you in jail , ' "" she said .
Tempa , a travel agent in the area , said : "" If we go out , then the police ask us to go inside our house . ""
The usually bustling district , where tens of thousands Tibetan exiles live , was quiet .
India offered a haven to the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader , when he fled after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 .
Since then the Tibetan population in India has grown to an estimated 100,000 .
Tenzin Jigdal , an activist in Delhi , said : "" I was born in India and feel really privileged to live in a free country .
This is where the non - violent Tibetan movement was nurtured and inspired by the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi .
It pains me that a freedom - loving democratic country like India bows down to China . ""
A well - known Tibetan writer , Tenzin Tsundue , was arrested by policemen in plain clothes during a tea break at a seminar on Tibet and India on Tuesday .
Delhi police officials told the Times of India newspaper that Tsundue had been arrested due to his "" notorious activities "" in the southern city of Bangalore , where he had publicly protested during a previous visit by the Chinese premier .
Elsewhere , students of Tibetan origin were reported to be confined to halls of residence and barred from meeting media .
Indian authorities have repeatedly been criticised for failing to protect free speech in recent months .
In January , protests by hardline local Muslim groups forced the author Salman Rushdie to cancel an appearance at a major literary festival .
Chinese relations with India are variable .
The two emerging economic powers have extensive trade links and top Indian officials frequently visit Beijing , but India is concerned about growing Chinese military might .
There is also tension over unresolved border disputes and Chinese support for India 's hostile neighbour , Pakistan .
Many Indian analysts accept their country is unlikely to make good the economic and developmental gulf that separates the two regional rivals , but say that India 's "" soft power "" and "" cultural influence "" is an advantage .
Beijing blames the Dalai Lama , who is based in the Indian hill town of Dharamasala , for fomenting unrest among the Tibetan population in China .
Monday 's was the second self - immolation in India in recent months .
Late last year , Sherab Tsedor , a young Tibetan exile , set himself on fire outside the Chinese embassy , suffering minor burns .
Tsedor said on Tuesday that he still supported self - immolation . ""
This is very important .
World leaders and the United Nations still are not paying attention to us , "" he said .
"" They are always talking about human rights all over the world but when it comes to China or Tibet then they are silent . """
2012-03-29,"A 27-year - old Tibetan exile called Jamphel Yeshi set himself on fire in Delhi this week as a protest against the visit to India of the Chinese president , Hu Jintao .
He was one of 20 Tibetans who have chosen to set themselves alight this year , of whom 18 have died .
Many people might consider self - immolation particularly foreign , strange and incomprehensible .
The idea , somehow conjures up distant memories of kamikaze fighters , or newspaper pictures of the Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc , who sat engulfed in flames protesting against the South Vietnamese government in June 1963 , or even , perhaps , the image of the Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima who committed seppuku after a failed coup d'etat in November 1970 .
And yet for many people such actions are not strange but positive and dignified .
Desperate people take desperate measures especially when they feel humiliated and worthless .
Mohamed Bouazizi , who set himself on fire on 17 December , 2010 , was a street vendor fed up with petty confiscations and harassment by government officials .
His act caught a mood and became the catalyst for the Tunisian revolution and the wider Arab spring .
His death was against Islamic teaching , but restored a type of natural justice .
Martyrdom is hardly new .
It is at the heart of many world religions .
Christianity itself has at its heart the idea of sacrifice and its history is packed with people who have wilfully courted every sort of horrific death for an invisible principle ; and we have seen that some Muslim jihadists have been willing to blow themselves up .
Martyrdom is just as likely to be connected with the religiosity of a nationalist cause or ideological fad .
Indeed , the British Isles too has had its religious and its ideological martyrs from Saint Alban in the fifth century to the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison who died for the women 's movement under the hooves of the king 's horse at Epsom in 1913 .
Yet our most obvious examples of the belief in self - sacrifice come from the history of the struggle for Irish independence .
In 1916 , the city centre of Dublin had been reduced to ash by British artillery and Irish bullets .
Padraig Pearce , soldier - poet and leader of the rising and The O'Rahilly , reluctant last - minute volunteer , exchanged a few words during a lull in the fighting .
Pearce ( later to be shot by firing squad ) tells O'Rahilly , "" well , when we 're all wiped out , people will blame us for everything , I suppose "" .
Dublin was a hopeless cause , an Irish Alamo .
At its heart was a symbolic as well as a physical rebellion .
It was timed to begin in Easter week and those involved knew that they were the "" blood sacrifice "" for the future of Irish nationalism .
This is how revolutions begin : with brave people who have "" stupid "" dreams that apparently simply can not succeed .
Folk , whom George Bernard Shaw once said , "" fight with a rope round [ their ] neck "" and are therefore outside the circumstances of normal life and have already entered another realm in which the supreme decision , to live or die , has brought a type of decisiveness to their lives .
For revolutionaries such as this , theirs is already a better world , somehow already achieved by their own deaths .
Such people fight because others say that nothing has a hope of changing , and everything will remain as before .
This they can not believe .
The status quo is itself killing .
It is precisely their sacrifice that will alter history .
The self - murder of those who die for a cause is always brought about by a supreme decision to act now for future times .
The suicide is no longer a victim of historical circumstances , but instead rises above those circumstances in order to command them for one final time .
Such a dream is changed into political reality by the force of history .
Personal apocalypse brings history to an end as the religious martyr goes heavenward or the nationalist gathers his people in the promised land .
Utopia is finally gained .
Such radicals already know that they are "" out of date "" and that they effectively belong to a past that needs to be left behind .
Their death will , by a strange metamorphosis , bring about the utopian future , herald a new world , from which , by a supreme irony they will be absent , excluded by their own actions .
Bobby Sands ( Roibeárd Gearóid Ó Seachnasaigh ) was 27 when he died on 5 May 1981 , in Long Kesh prison after a hunger strike lasting 66 days .
He had already spent nine years in jail in the cause of Irish independence .
While imprisoned he wrote poetry and kept a diary written on toilet paper with an old ball - point refill hidden "" in his body "" .
"" I fought the Monster today , "" Sands records .
"" I was thinking today about the hunger strike .
People say a lot about the body , but do n't trust it … at the end … everything returns to … the mind . ""
For Sands , freedom and the mind were synonymous and freedom was synonymous with Ireland itself .
The ultimate control of the body and its functions leaves the mind clear to act in existential freedom , freed of the world and of bodily needs .
When the final act comes via fire , bullet or starvation , it gives a purpose and moral trajectory to a life more or less ordinary .
Self - immolation is a supreme spectacle , a theatre of nationalist or ideological politics acted out for the world 's media .
The Chinese government has labelled the Tibetans who have died as terrorists .
It is right in one sense .
The act itself has robbed the state of its power over the citizen and restored individual freedom of action .
At the last moment , those killing themselves are ironically most alive and yet already somehow absent as their future is born ."
2012-04-26,"The spotlight on the Bo Xilai affair has turned back on to political tensions in China following reports that officials in Chongqing wiretapped a call to the country 's president , Hu Jintao – helping to trigger the scandal that unseated Bo .
Official accounts of the case have portrayed it as being unrelated to the political struggle for power in the country .
Bo is instead accused of unspecified disciplinary violations while his wife , Gu Kailai , is accused of murdering the British businessman Neil Heywood .
But the New York Times , which cited almost a dozen sources with ties to the Communist party , said the wiretapping was seen as evidence of Bo 's overreaching ambition and compounded leaders ' mistrust of him .
It said anti - surveillance devices detected that the call to Hu , made by a senior anti - corruption official in Chongqing last August , was being monitored .
Bo was party secretary of the south - western city at the time .
The incident encouraged disciplinary and security officials to investigate Bo 's police chief and ally , Wang Lijun .
That is thought to be one of the factors that ultimately led to Wang 's flight this year to a US consulate , where he alleged that Gu had murdered Heywood .
Jean - Pierre Cabestan , professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University , described the wiretapping as "" a kind of betrayal "" .
He added : "" This is more than the killing of one man .
That was the last straw , but I think before that , and even without that , [ Bo ] was already being investigated and would have been forced into retirement or something more serious . ""
It underscored how much mistrust you have among leaders and particularly between Bo and some of the people in the centre . ""
According to the New York Times , a preliminary indictment in March accused Bo of damaging party unity by collecting evidence on other leaders .
But Bo Zhiyue , an expert on elite politics at the University of Singapore and no relation of Bo Xilai , thought it unlikely that authorities would disclose such matters publicly .
"" It may [ prove to ] be a fact that Bo Xilai did all these things for his own advancement but it is too damaging to make public , "" he said .
"" Who knows who else might be involved ?
It would be a lot more complicated , "" he said .
The New York Times said the eavesdropping operations in Chongqing began as part of a surveillance project overseen by Wang , which was officially intended to tackle crime and maintain stability in the area but went much further .
One political analyst , citing information obtained from a colonel , alleged Bo sought to tap the phones of virtually all high - ranking leaders who visited the city – including Zhou Yongkang , the security boss thought to be Bo 's main defender among senior leaders . ""
Bo wanted to be extremely clear about what leaders ' attitudes toward him were , "" the analyst told the newspaper .
The newspaper said that in the case last August , Ma Wen , minister of supervision , was calling Hu on a high - security land link from the state guesthouse in Chongqing , which was monitored on Bo 's orders .
After learning of the tapping , Beijing turned central security and disciplinary investigators on to Wang , whom Bo blamed for the incident .
The political analyst told the New York Times that the party 's central commission for discipline inspection had stationed up to four teams in Chongqing – two of them undercover – by the beginning of 2012 .
One focus was a corruption case in a city where Wang was once police chief .
A party academic with ties to Bo said Wang had twice filed complaints to the inspection commission before his flight to the US consulate , claiming Bo had "" opposed party central "" authorities , including ordering the wiretapping of central leaders .
The requests were rejected .
But Bo was furious to learn that Wang had also monitored calls by him and Gu , sources said .
Following Wang 's flight he detained his wiretapping specialist , a district police chief named Wang Pengfei .
With attention to the Bo family 's finances growing , his brother resigned from a Hong Kong - listed company , China Everbright International , late on Wednesday .
The company said the decision was taken "" to minimise any possible adverse impact on the company of certain reports recently published by the media on his family background "" .
Bo Xiyong , who had been vice - chair at the company since 2003 under the name Li Xueming , held around 10 m of its shares , worth around $ 4.2 m .
A commentary in the state - run tabloid
Global Times accused the west of using the case to score cheap points .
"" Bo is being investigated in accordance with the law .
This news is really explosive , but will not shake China 's political foundation , "" it said .
"" Most western people are unfamiliar with Bo 's name and Chongqing .
It is illogical that the mainstream western media places so much attention on Bo 's case , "" it complained .
It claimed the Chinese public 's interest in the case was dwindling .
Chinese media have not been able to report on it beyond reprinting the official Xinhua announcements ."
2012-06-05,"France 's far right leader Marine Le Pen will consider suing Madonna if she uses a video depicting the Front National president with a swastika on her face during performances in France .
The image was shown on a huge screen at a concert the US singer gave in Israel , while she performed the song Nobody Knows Me .
In the video , the faces of several world personalities appeared including Pope Benedict , the Chinese leader Hu Jintao and the US politician Sarah Palin .
Themontage then briefly showed Le Pen 's eyes and forehead with a swastika superimposed on her face , before her portrait appeared followed by an image resembling Adolf Hitler .
The provocative stunt at the Tel Aviv concert brought furious reactions in France .
Le Pen warned : "" If she does that in France , we 'll be waiting for her . ""
A party official told the newspaper 20 Minutes the Front National 's lawyer was looking at possible legal action .
Madonna , 53 , is due to give a concert in Paris on 14 July , France 's national day , and in Nice on 21 August as part of her 80-concert world tour covering 30 countries .
"" It 's understandable when ageing singers who need publicity go to such extremes , "" Le Pen said .
"" Her songs do n't work any more . ""
Even the Socialist government spokesperson Najat Vallaud - Belkacem said the assimilation of Le Pen with Hitler was regrettable .
Critics of the the Front National , however , pointed out that in January a leading member of the party produced a caricature of former president Nicolas Sarkozy wearing a Nazi uniform .
Le Pen , who came third with just under 18 % of the vote in the first round of the presidential election in April , has been attempting to distance her party from supporters who hold Nazi sympathies , inherited from her father Jean - Marie Le Pen .
In Le Parisien newspaper , she hit back at Madonna , who has adopted two children from Malawi . ""
By the way , has Madonna given back the children she stole from Africa ?
Or did she end up buying them ?
"" she asked .
Le Pen is hoping the Front National will pick up parliamentary seats in the two - round general election on June 10 and 17 ."
2012-07-01,"Hundreds of thousands of people marched for hours in searing heat on Sunday to express their frustration with how Hong Kong is run , in the latest phase of a crisis of governance in the former British colony .
Whistles , drums , horns and loud chanting went on into the night as a determined core of demonstrators marched on the 15th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule .
Though an annual event , Sunday 's demonstration was the largest since that of 2003 , which helped bring down the first Beijing - backed chief executive , Tung Chee - hwa .
Organisers estimated that 400,000 people were on the march .
Throughout the day , protesters including young families , students and politicians surged out of Victoria Park into cordoned - off streets lined by police , towards the central government offices .
In the morning , a new chief executive , Leung Chun - ying , was sworn in by the visiting Chinese president , Hu Jintao , in a scrupulously controlled ceremony .
Even there , a lone protester managed to shout out demands for China to account for the deaths of hundreds around Tiananmen Square in Beijing on 4 June 1989 , before he was quickly hustled out of sight .
Hu expressed China 's confidence in Hong Kong 's role as a free , law - abiding society , though in a sign of Beijing 's anxiety over recent tensions , he appealed for unity . ""
While we recognise Hong Kong 's achievements 15 years after the handover , we must also be conscious of the deep disagreements and problems in Hong Kong society , "" Hu said .
But there were demands from the streets for more representative government to replace a system in which Leung , a self - made millionaire , was chosen by 689 members of a 1,200-member hand - picked committee largely owing allegiance to Beijing .
Anger at the perceived manipulation of what was promised to be "" Hong Kong people running Hong Kong "" has been joined in recent weeks by disgust at reports of outgoing leader Donald Tsang revelling in a lifestyle including tycoons ' private jets , lavish hotels and a sweetheart luxury property offer , since rejected .
Alongside the local political demands for democracy , many demonstrators highlighted human rights concerns , with some carrying pictures of the detained blind and deaf Chinese dissident Li Wangyang , who was found hanged with his feet still touching the floor in what Chinese officials have chosen to describe as a suicide .
Fear of China has meshed with a generalised contempt for the incoming leader .
Leung , 57 , known widely as CY .
Banners ranged from the pithy "" F.U.C.Y. "" to pictures of the property surveyor millionaire with the long nose of Pinocchio .
A surprise winner against Henry Tang in the March process to select a new leader , CY is seen by many as too close to Beijing .
"" We do n't like CY "" said a retired teacher KY Tsang , when asked why he and his wife had decided to join the demonstration for the first time .
"" We do n't like to see the intervention of China into our affairs . ""
His wife added that she did not think one demonstration could change things , "" but we hope we can slow down their aggression "" . ""
And I mean the terrible torture of pro - democracy people such as Li Wangyang .
It is unacceptable , unbelievable .
Such a crime could only happen in a totalitarian country , "" she said , choosing not to give her name .
A statement from Leung 's new administration insisted his government would uphold the "" core values "" of Hong Kong – a catchphrase intended to cover freedom of expression and assembly and the rule of law .
"" I am here to express my view that there is a lot of unfairness here , "" said Abel Lau , a younger teacher .
"" The first thing is that freedom of speech is not as free as before .
And the government is not doing so well –
it is leaning towards corporate and business persons .
They do n't represent us , but they have the power , "" he said .
Recent surveys have shown higher numbers than ever before of people choosing to identify themselves as Hong Kong people instead of as Chinese .
More prevalent than in previous years were people waving the Hong Kong colonial flag , a combination of the UK union flag with the pre-1997 Hong Kong coat of arms ."
2012-07-02,"It takes guts to stand up to the all - powerful .
But that is what the Hong Kong journalist Rex Hon Yiu - ting showed when he shouted a question at Chinese president Hu Jintao from behind a press line this weekend .
During the president 's visit to Hong Kong , Mr Hon , who works for the local Apple Daily , yelled out a question about China 's post - Tiananmen Square crackdown .
Mr Hon was immediately forcibly removed from the press area by police and accused of causing a disturbance .
Fortunately , protests from other journalists and pro - democracy campaigners in the area secured Mr Hon 's release and police offered a guarded apology .
But the incident is a sharp reminder of the increased fragility of freedoms in Hong Kong , 15 years after the handback .
Organisers claimed that 400,000 people rallied for human rights there at the weekend .
That turnout and the quick response of local journalists helped ensure that Mr Hon was not a lone voice ."
2012-07-09,"The momentum for social innovation is picking up in the Far East .
In 2007 , President Hu Jintao of the People 's Republic of China made a proclamation about the importance of social development to the wellbeing of its people and , since then , various initiatives have been springing up .
It has now been more than three years since the British Council launched the Skills for Social Entrepreneurs in China , training 250 professionals in addressing community - based issues through social enterprise .
Earlier this year , a Social Enterprise Summit in Hong Kong attracted more than 100 organisations .
A question of identity As in Britain
, Chinese social entrepreneurs find themselves lacking the right legal framework in which to trade , uncomfortably deliberating between not - for - profit or for - profit status .
However , the dispute should be less about whether the enterprise is for - profit or not - for - profit ( this distinction is often less important in the early stages of most enterprises as most are loaded with risks and shortcomings in their pursuit of meeting costs ) .
The more important question is what are the resources available in China to support the social entrepreneur ?
Growing support While it has still to catch up in terms of scale , China has seen a number of social enterprise organisations such as the China Social Entrepreneur Foundation establish themselves .
UK - born Leigh - Anne Russell , from the Non - Profit Incubator ( NPI ) in Shanghai , has been working with the Ministry of Civil Affairs ( MOCA ) and the Shanghai social sector , and says that "" relevant government policies are under review , and reform is being pushed in order to support the development of social entrepreneurship as a more sustainable way to address societal challenges "" .
The Narada Foundation and Ecsel are also among the group of incubators that promote partnerships and provide support for social innovation in China .
Russell 's new project is The Nest , a social innovation park project lead by NPI and Moca due to open in 2013 .
It will provide a physical space in Shanghai for social entrepreneurs to share learning and build links across sectors in order to devise solutions that address local social issues .
The Nest and other co - working spaces in China like Xindanwei are setting up shop in all of the major Chinese cities , and are urban landmarks for social innovation .
Anna Levy from Hub Islington , the original hub of a global network with more than 4,000 members and which has supported the growth of the social enterprise sector in London since it opened in 2005 , explains that these spaces are instrumental in supporting start - ups achieve their impact .
"" It 's not just about providing affordable office space and facilities , although that is of course important at the early stages of a business , but even more crucially , these spaces provide access to a readymade network of like - minded individuals and organisations with a wealth of shared experience and potentially useful contacts and knowledge , "" she says .
Eastern promise This emergence of social entrepreneurship in China , with government endorsement and buttressed by the establishment of the appropriate support networks and institutions , provides real opportunities for the UK entrepreneur to venture east for trade .
Key for the success of any such initiative is respecting that , while influenced by European and American practices of social enterprise , the trend in China will still have characteristics that reflect local culture and tradition .
Getting to grips with what this might mean in practice will be essential for any start - up entrepreneur wishing to stand to gain from the opportunities in China .
We 'll be considering some of these questions tomorrow evening – Tuesday 10 July – in a debate at the Hub Islington , organised by We Impact , Hub Islington and the ChinaNext Foundation .
Emerge :
Pioneering Social Innovation in China will open a conversation on the social innovation sector in China , with a panel debate which invites the perspective of professionals like Erika Helms , founder of Linking China Ltd , and Tristan Edmonson from CSR Asia to share first - hand expertise of what China has to offer .
Isabel Hilton , editor of the bilingual sustainability news source , ChinaDialogue , will also be providing her perspective on the role of the media and communications , with start - up entrepreneurs from the UK with recent experience in China joining the discussion to share their experiences .
In the words of Helms , whose social enterprise focuses on exchanges between the third sectors of Europe and China , the key obstacle to social enterprise in China involves developing local capacity and experience .
Helms sees "" real opportunities for UK - based intermediaries to share their capacity building , education and other support mechanisms with those up - and - coming organisations in China that aim to support the growth of the sector "" .
The ChinaNext Foundation , newly registered as a charity in the UK that serves as a bridge builder between civil organisations in China and Europe , also endeavours to share the best practice of civil society in the UK with developments in China .
Seeing that the UK is becoming a world leader in social enterprise , the work of Linking China and the foundation will bring extra promise to UK social entrepreneurs with their sights set on the East .
Christina Rebel is UK projects and research co - ordinator at We Impact , a social enterprise based in Beijing and Shanghai in China and London .
Its mission is to develop and promote opportunities to realise sustainable lifestyles around the world .

2012-07-15,"France 's far - right Front National ( FN ) is to sue Madonna for using a picture of its leader with a swastika on her forehead .
A spokesman for Marine Le Pen , the FN president who came third in the May presidential elections , said a lawsuit for "" public insult "" would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days .
At a concert in the French capital on Saturday evening , the American singer showed a video in which Le Pen 's face appears with other well - known figures including Pope Benedict , Chinese leader Hu Jintao and US Republican Sarah Palin .
In the clip , shown on a giant screen to accompany the song Nobody Knows Me , Le Pen , 43 , appears with the Nazi symbol overlaid on her face , just before an image resembling Adolf Hitler .
The image sent a ripple through the crowd at Le Stade de France , where Madonna was performing as part of her 80-date world tour .
Le Pen , who has tried to clean up the FN 's Nazi - sympathising image since taking over from her father Jean - Marie 18 months ago , had already warned that she would take Madonna , 53 , to court if she aired the video in France .
After the singer first used the image at a concert in Tel Aviv at the end of May , Le Pen said : "" If she tries that in France , we 'll see what happens , "" adding : "" It 's understandable when ageing singers who need publicity go to such extremes . ""
Even the Socialist government spokesperson , Najat Vallaud - Belkacem , has said that the comparison of Le Pen to Hitler is regrettable .
On Sunday , Florian Philippot , the FN vice - president , described it as a provocation and a "" very serious insult "" .
He accused Madonna of "" trying to get more people to her concerts "" .
"" We can not accept everything .
We can not accept this insulting connection .
Marine Le Pen is defending her honour , but also that of party members and supporters and the millions of Front National voters , "" he said .
The Paris concert , which was not sold out , is one of two French dates by Madonna this summer .
She is due to perform in Nice on 21 August ."
2012-07-19,"China has offered $ 20bn ( £ 12bn ) in loans to African countries over the next three years , cementing an alliance that appears increasingly hostile to the west .
Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , promised the credit line – double the amount China pledged for the previous three - year period in 2009 – on Thursday during the opening ceremony of the Forum on China - Africa Co - operation in Beijing .
China 's non - judgmental approach to business continues to gain traction with African governments , who say they will no longer tolerate being lectured by a hypocritical west that includes their former colonial masters .
Criticism that Africa is allowing its natural resources to be exploited , and that China is content to bolster dictators and ignore human rights abuses , merely feeds the partners ' anti - western sentiment .
Hu brushed aside such concerns in his speech at the Great Hall of the People , attended by leaders from 50 African states including South Africa 's Jacob Zuma and Equatorial Guinea 's Teodoro Obiang Nguema , widely condemned by western activists as a brutal and corrupt dictator .
"" China and Africa should increase co - ordination and co - operation in international affairs , "" Hu said .
"" We should oppose the practices of the big bullying the small , the strong domineering over the weak and the rich oppressing the poor . ""
He continued : "" China wholeheartedly and sincerely supports African countries to choose their own development path , and will wholeheartedly and sincerely support them to raise their development ability . ""
China will "" continue to steadfastly stand together with the African people , and will forever be a good friend , a good partner and a good brother "" , he added at the summit , which is held every three years since 2000 .
Hu said the new loans would support infrastructure , agriculture , manufacturing and development of small and medium - sized businesses in Africa .
He also pledged to "" continue to expand aid to Africa , so that the benefits of development can be realised by the African people "" .
Africa is increasingly portrayed as a microcosm of the shifting global balance of power : three years ago China overtook the US as the continent 's biggest trading partner .
Zuma did little to diminish the sense of rivalry with remarks that doubtless flattered his host .
"" Africa 's past economic experience with Europe dictates a need to be cautious when entering into partnerships with other economies , "" the South African president said .
"" We are particularly pleased that in our relationship with China we are equals and that agreements entered into are for mutual gain .
This gathering indicates commitment to mutual respect and benefit .
"" We certainly are convinced that China 's intention is different to that of Europe , which to date continue to attempt to influence African countries for their sole benefit . ""
China 's alliance with Africa dates back to the 1950s , when Beijing backed liberation movements fighting to overthrow western colonial rule .
In the past decade , China says its trade with Africa jumped from little more than $ 10bn ( £ 6.35bn ) in 2000 to $ 166.3bn in 2011 , driven by Chinese hunger for resources and African demand for cheap Chinese products .
Western critics say China supports governments with dubious human rights records .
The Asian country 's biggest African trading partners in 2010 were Angola , ruled by one man for 33 years , South Africa and Sudan , whose president is wanted by the international criminal court .
China is also accused of importing labour to build roads and hospitals and extracting raw materials for processing at home , leaving little for local economies .
During a visit to Zambia last year , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , warned against a "" new colonialism "" .
China bridles at such attacks and argues that China - Africa economic co - operation and trade now drives around a fifth of the continent 's economic growth , while China has aided 600 infrastructure projects across the continent .
In a recent speech at South Africa 's Institute of International Affairs in Johannesburg ( pdf ) , the Chinese ambassador , Xian Xuejun , said : "" Chinese and African people harbour simple but friendly sentiments towards each other .
But there is a lack of in - depth understanding .
Some western politicians and media also tend to make irresponsible remarks on China - Africa relations , attempting to mess up
our co - operation . ""
Xian insisted that China has a "" non - interference policy "" with "" no political conditions attached "" because Africans know their own situation best .
"" We have never pointed fingers to African countries concerning their independent and own choice of political system because we have never drawn lines according to ideological differences . ""
Chinese officials claim it is all about business .
Gao Xiqing , the vice - chairman and president of the China Investment Corporation , the country 's sovereign wealth fund that invests in more than 100 countries , said : "" We grew up studying Karl Marx , Lenin , Chairman Mao .
Karl Marx said the workers have no motherland and in fact today capital knows no boundaries of state .
Wherever there 's profit to be made , capital will go there .
There 's not that much difference for Chinese capital , as compared to any capital in the world . ""
But Gao said China still had a long way to go to rival western investment in Africa .
"" We do n't compete with Americans , "" he told the New York Forum Africa conference in Gabon last month .
"" If you count your investment as the percentage of the capital market , the United States accounts for almost half of all the world 's capital markets , so how do you compete with that ?
Americans have been in this continent for a long time . ""
Despite all the income investment in Africa , China only accounts for a few percentage points , whereas the western powers have been here forever and they account for more than 90 % , especially the minerals and resources investments .
So we do n't compete ; we come here to co - operate . """
2012-09-24,"The 80 million - strong Communist party of China is famously contradictory – impressively unified in its ability to maintain power , but riven with internal divisions about issues like the role of the market in China , or the function of non - state companies .
A botched leadership change this autumn would cause the sort of vicious infighting that led to the collapse of other one - party systems elsewhere .
For this reason , the current Chinese leadership , led by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao have been planning this tricky succession for many years .
All looked smooth at the end of last year , but as the all - important party congress nears , the process looks increasingly shaky .
The fall of key contender Bo Xilai after his wife was accused of murder and he of corruption in the spring was the start of it .
The fact that Xi Jinping , heir apparent to Hu , disappeared from view for two weeks in September further raised the temperature .
In a political system as opaque and controlling as the current Chinese one , speculation becomes the sole recourse for a population – inside and outside China – which has never been hungrier for information .
The Hu - Wen period leaves one major legacy to successors : immense growth .
China 's economy is now four times the size it was in 2002 when they came to power , rising from sixth to second place in global rankings , with the greatest amount of foreign reserves , and the largest levels of exports and second largest imports .
Growth has created a number of problems however – greater inequality , environmental and energy supply problems , and a rise in visible tension in society as elites and other interest groups clash , using newly available social media or other legal means to press their case .
The eruption of anger over pensions , lack of property rights , and legal redress over official malfeasance is expensive to keep under control .
China now spends more on internal security than on national defence .
The headache for the new leaders will be how to balance the continuing need for growth against other sociopolitical reforms that will be politically risky , but are the only way to try to create stability and balance in a society which is becoming wealthier , freer and more unruly .
The life of elite leaders is not made any easier by the fact that China is now in an era when the tension between the officials and those they are meant to be ruling has reached fever pitch .
Surveys show that central leaders just about maintain some moral credibility in society – but local leaders are regarded with large amounts of loathing .
Levels of cynicism about politics in China are on a par with , or even in excess , of those in the west .
Most regarded the treatment of Bo Xilai as crude political theatre , created to manoeuvre a clever communicator and a potentially threatening popular leader out of the way .
The only given in the current situation is that levels of suspicion against official discourse is high , and the default of most people is disbelief .
This is not a good context in which to try to undertake radical reforms .
The new leaders have their hands tied because their macroeconomic policy is already set out in the five - year programme from 2011 to 2015 .
Only catastrophe would make them change this important statement of consensus .
They will also be curtailed by questions about the legitimacy of how they were appointed –
this is a process which has never been tried before in this way in China , and many could question it , inside and outside the party – and by the need to keep on board "" retired "" leaders who are likely to remain active behind the scenes .
Their political capital will be low at the start , and it will be a hard slog trying to find easy ways to acquire it quickly .
The post Hu and Wen leadership will have , in addition to the ally of growth , one other great helper .
There is , at the moment , no alternative to the party – all effective opposition has been crushed .
The party is able to present itself , under whatever leadership , as the great stabilising force , and it can wave horrifying visions of the debilitating effects of instability and disunity before a population that , for the most part , shows strong interest in getting richer and little in pushing for risky political change .
So far , this social contract seems to be holding up .
The party rules , and the people get more prosperous .
But the question of how long that can continue – of what happens if the growth rate falls , or the wealth gap continues to increase – is a real and pressing one .
For Hu and Wen , China had to grow rich and strong .
For the next generation , Chinese society must grow more balanced , more just and more predictable .
Achieving that will be a hard task , especially if it also involves maintaining the Communist party 's utterly unique place in society ."
2012-11-08,"China 's leader , Hu Jintao , has begun his farewell to power with a warning that corruption could kill the Communist party and a call to safeguard party control .
He has overseen a decade of maintaining the status quo and an annus horribilis for the leadership – complete with lurid tales of Ferrari crashes , family fortunes and even murder .
The sense of both stasis and crisis has amplified calls for reform as a new generation takes charge of the world 's most populous nation .
But hopes of such changes were muted on Thursday as Hu delivered his report to more than 2,200 delegates , who had gathered under the glowing red star in Beijing 's Great Hall of the People for the 18th party congress .
Failing to tackle corruption "" could prove fatal to the party and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state "" , he warned .
"" Leading officials … should both exercise strict self - discipline and strengthen education and supervision over their family and staff . ""
No one was above the law and whoever erred should face "" justice without mercy "" , he added , in the sharpest warning he has delivered about the dangers of official abuses .
The scandal surrounding the politician Bo Xilai – now awaiting prosecution , following his wife 's conviction for murdering the British businessman Neil Heywood – and further revelations about leaders and their families have fed public cynicism .
Meanwhile , economic , social , political and environmental problems have accumulated over years of unbalanced , breakneck growth in a state - dominated economy – and threaten to become still more evident as the pace of growth ebbs .
Yet while some have hoped that such problems might help to prompt political reforms , Hu told his party : "" We have held high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics and neither taken the old and rigid closed - door policy nor taken the wrong path of changing the banner [ abandoning socialism ] . ""
Later he spelled it out : "" We will never copy a western political system . ""
Zhang Jian , a political scientist at Peking University , said the report appeared to have sent "" a very strong message to any expectations of reform : we are not going to change ; we are going to stay where we are "" .
Chen Ziming , an independent Beijing - based scholar , said : "" It does not point to the future direction demanded both inside or outside the party .
It basically continues the tune of the past .
"" I did not expect any big breakthrough , but this time there is not even a small breakthrough . ""
The report was never going to be a pioneering political document .
Its function is to review the five years since the previous congress and lay out a general path ahead .
It is not even a personal testament – the document is circulated widely within the party and produced over several months and numerous drafts .
Consensus and continuity are key : the 2007 report underwent around 1,000 revisions .
The delegates will have been highly familiar with the content long before they arrived in the cavernous hall – though Xi Jinping , Hu 's heir apparent , nonetheless scribbled assiduously throughout .
Hu 's predecessor , Jiang Zemin , looked less enthralled , glancing at his watch and yawning during the 90-minute address , an edited version of the report .
Jiang had entered with Hu and sat beside him , highlighting the power he still wields .
Though the new leaders are in theory appointed by the central committee , itself chosen by the congress delegates , they are in reality selected by the incumbents and party patriarchs .
China has been transformed during Hu 's tenure .
In 2002 it was the world 's sixth largest economy ; now it is the second .
It is , for the first time , a predominantly urban nation , with just over half its 1.4 billion citizens living in cities .
Its global influence is greater than ever .
Changes in the party have been more modest .
Of the 39 figures at the front of the dais –
the politburo , party patriarchs and leading military figures – only one , Liu Yandong , was a woman .
The new standing committee , like every one before it , is expected to be entirely male .
Much of the report could have been lifted directly from 2007 's document , though there were nods to new developments . ""
Social problems have increased markedly , "" it warned and there was , perhaps , marginally more stress on the need to support the rural poor and integrate urban and rural development .
There was also a possible hint at strengthening the role of the market .
Environmental issues had a section to themselves for the first time .
In a reflection of broader social concerns , Hu stressed the need to improve civic morality and to "" exalt the true , the good and the beautiful and reject the false , the evil and the ugly "" .
China 's neighbours are less likely to welcome the commitment to "" enhance our capacity for exploiting marine resources … resolutely safeguard China 's maritime rights and interests and build China into a maritime power "" , given the territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas .
But overall the blandness was "" a fitting finale to 10 years of Huism , "" said Kerry Brown , professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney .
"" When you think of the extraordinary events going on , and put it beside Obama 's victory speech , you realise we are dealing with an elite from another planet . """

2012-11-09,"If one world leader had ended the week promising the best is yet to come , another world leader , this time outgoing , said almost the opposite : the best has already been .
Hu Jintao 's speech was the sternest warning he has yet given to the new generation of leaders about to take over not to change the system .
Addresses to party congress are not personal political pleas in the sense that we understand them .
They are collectively rehearsed mission statements , and this one would have involved Mr Hu 's successor , Xi Jinping .
But the lecture the old guard was giving the new was unmistakable : do n't follow the west ; keep with the system you know ; guard against unrest .
This was not the speech of a reformer , but of a leader who wanted to cast his legacy firmly in the mould of the state 's founder .
He repeated three times the phrase "" Mao Zedong thought "" .
If China 's most scandal - ridden year produced a political lesson , here at last it was .
High - speed Ferrari crashes , murder trials , corruption , princelings cut down to size and awaiting trial all crystalised into one idea : you rock the boat at your collective peril .
Hu 's 100-minute disquisition on his own contribution to political theory in China , the Scientific Outlook on Development , may already have been laughed out of court by the microbloggers .
But Hu is deadly serious about keeping the party both pragmatic and effective .
The changing of the guard at the 18th party congress will not be total .
Like China 's feared and supposedly overbearing mothers - in - law , Mr Hu and Jiang Zemin will still be around .
There were some signs of flexibility towards the rising classes .
The state may reduce the role it plays in managing state - owned enterprises and Hu acknowledged the complaints from private businessmen that when it comes to banks and regulators , the playing field is far from level .
But in sum , this was dreary stuff .
A paean , certainly , to the last decade which has seen his country transformed from the world 's sixth - largest economy in 2002 to its second now .
But a massive stop sign , too , to any suggestion of political pluralism at any level of the state .
The challenge for his successor is not immediately economic : Hu 's pledge that incomes will double in the next decade is in line with most expectations for average GDP growth over the period .
It is political .
As average incomes grow , so too will the demands of the people for a fairer share of the cake .
The "" Chinese characteristics "" of the state 's avowed socialism will become so great , that if it does not reform it will rupture .
Nationalist autocracy is just as likely to be the result as democracy .
It will be interesting to see how far and how quickly Xi moves away from Hu 's shadow , if he does at all ."
2012-11-13,"•
In a week - long party conference comprised mainly of soporific work reports and rhetoric - heavy speechifying , unbridled emotion has emerged as a counterintuitive motif .
While the congress 's 2,268 party delegates are technically responsible for workshopping their leaders ' reports , many have opted to err on the side of sycophancy rather than genuine criticism .
Migrant worker delegate Ju Xiaolin shed tears while reading an original poem called Getting New Hope , a paean to president Hu Jintao 's 64-page Thursday morning political report .
"" I found it !
I found it !
I found the new hope in my heart , "" he said , eyes glistening with tears .
"" I found new hope at noon on November 8 , at the podium at the Great Hall of the People , when I heard Chairman Hu Jintao 's thunderous voice . ""
A broad range of delegates were ineffably moved by Hu 's speech , which contained heartrending lines such as "" the scientific outlook on development is the theoretical guidance the party must adhere to for a long time "" .
"" I shed tears five times when listening to President Hu 's report , "" said Ningxia delegate Li Jian .
"" I will remember that day all my life , "" proclaimed delegate Shan Dan from Inner Mongolia .
The report "" makes my heart flutter , "" said Guangzhou party secretary , Wan Qingliang .
Some delegates need n't even speak to exude their communist fervour : in a bizarre Mao - era coincidence , seven of them are named Jianguo , or "" Build the Nation "" , according to Chinese media reports .
•
Fifty - six - year - old delegate Liang Wengen , billionaire chairman of the construction equipment maker Sany Group , divulged one little - known benefit of joining the Communist party as a young man .
"" The wives of most party members are prettier than those of non - party members , "" he said at a Sunday press conference .
"" Chinese girls love party members more . ""
Why ?
Liang explained : "" Because party members have ideals , they have a spirit of devotion . ""
Continuing , Liang urged the central government to give freer range to private enterprise .
•
The congress has welcomed foreign reporters with open arms , if domestic media coverage is any indication .
China Central Television has interviewed an Australian reporter , Angela Yu , who achieved minor internet fame after asking the National Development and Reform Commission a minute - long question about Sino - Australian relations in Chinese .
"" You speak very good Chinese , "" the commission 's chairman replied warmly .
But there 's a twist : according to the Wall Street Journal , Yu 's company , CAMG Media Group , has Chinese government ties .
•
Another motif is primary school - aged journalists , who have raised a few unexpectedly hard - hitting questions for party delegates .
When an 11-year - old girl confronted a group of high - level officials about food safety scandals on Friday , they "" suddenly straightened in their seats "" , according to the South China Morning Post .
On Monday , another 11-year - old , Jiang Jiahe , laid a hard truth on officials from the Ministry of Housing and Urban - Rural Development . ""
Right now homes are too expensive , "" he said .
"" A lot of my classmates ' parents spent all of their money on homes and borrowed a lot of money from the bank , and do n't have enough money to buy toys for their kids . ""
•
Females are poorly represented in high - level Chinese politics – only one woman sits on the 25-member politburo , the party 's central decision - making body , and none sit on the supreme nine - person committee at its core .
Yet the People 's Daily , a Communist party mouthpiece , has praised the congress 's female showing .
On Friday , the newspaper 's English - language website ran a photo gallery with the caption : "" Beautiful ritual girls , female reporters , and delegates to the party congress become beautiful scenery . ""
Yes , beautiful scenery .
The unabashedly sexist gallery even features a familiar face : on slide seven is none other than the Chinese - speaking Australian reporter ."
2012-11-14,"With a lot of red carpet and potted plants , numerous mentions of the scientific outlook on development , and a show of absolute unity , the Chinese Communist party concluded its 18th national congress on Wednesday – paving the way for the next generation of leaders to be unveiled on Thursday .
They will take charge of almost 1.4bn people and the world 's second largest economy , at a time when the country is more powerful yet faces increasing challenges in areas ranging from demographics to foreign policy .
It is the first transition not ordained by the founders of the People 's Republic – Deng Xiaoping picked the outgoing leader Hu Jintao – and the runup has proved bumpier than some anticipated , notably with the spectacular downfall of Bo Xilai , awaiting prosecution after his wife was convicted of murdering the British businessman Neil Heywood .
More than 2,000 congress delegates selected members of the central committee , although there were only a handful more seats than places .
The new body will on Thursday choose the 25-member Politburo and its standing committee , the tiny group of top leaders that is currently nine - strong but expected to shrink to seven .
But in reality Xi Jinping , long assumed to be Hu 's heir , and colleagues including Li Keqiang , lined up to succeed the premier , Wen Jiabao , have been picked by current and retired leaders .
The vice - premier , Wang Qishan , joined the party 's disciplinary body – signalling he is likely to join the standing committee , as thought , but moving away from his expertise in financial and economic affairs .
Zhou Xiaochuan , governor of the central bank , appears to be moving towards retirement as he was not included in the central committee .
Nor was the commerce minister , Chen Deming .
Only 10 of the 205 full members are women , down from 13 in the last committee .
Women were marginally better represented among the 171 non - voting alternate members .
Political manoeuvrings appear to have continued until the 11th hour before the handover , but unanimity reigned at the closing ceremony as delegates approved reports and amendments to the party constitution .
Asked if they had any objections , delegates delivered a string of noes .
Asked to raise their hands if in agreement , every person on stage did so .
The congress upgraded the outgoing leader Hu 's theoretical innovation – the scientific outlook on development , broadly meaning a fairer and more sustainable model – to rank alongside other guiding ideologies within the party constitution .
It also introduced the need to promote ecological progress to the constitution for the first time , underscoring a growing focus on environmental issues as leaders grapple with the problems that have built up over years of frenetic growth .
The ceremony concluded with the Internationale , played by a People 's Liberation Army brass band .
Leaders stood to attention before filing out , with many pausing to shake hands with associates and offer the occasional pat on the shoulder – a brief and tantalising hint of the personal relationships so crucial behind the scenes ."
2012-11-15,"Xi Jinping , who has been confirmed as the man who will lead China for the next decade , cuts a contrasting figure to his predecessor , Hu Jintao .
While Hu is determinedly anonymous , Xi is "" a big personality "" , according to those who have met him .
Standing over 6 ft tall , he is confident and affable .
He boasts a ready smile and a glamorous second wife – the renowned People 's Liberation Army singer Peng Liyuan .
He has expressed his fondness for US war movies and , perhaps more surprisingly , praised the edgy independent film - maker Jia Zhangke .
This is , in part , a generational and social shift .
Xi is 59 and , like the other rising stars in Chinese politics , grew up in the era of reform and opening .
While Hu 's first visit to the US was in 2002 , Xi and his peers have travelled frequently and several have personal links with the west .
Xi 's daughter is studying at Harvard and a sister is thought to live in Canada .
And like many of his peers , he is a "" princeling "" – someone who has experienced both privilege and prejudice as the child of a powerful Communist party figure .
Xi was born in 1953 to Xi Zhongxun , a Long March hero who later became a vice - premier , and Qi Xin .
He grew up in the relative comfort of Zhongnanhai , the party elite 's red - walled Beijing compound .
Loneliness
But when he was only nine his father fell from grace with Mao Zedong .
Six years later , as the cultural revolution wreaked havoc , young Xi was dispatched to the dusty , impoverished north - western province of Shaanxi to "" learn from the masses "" .
He spent seven years living in a cave home in Liangjiahe village .
"" I ate a lot more bitterness than most people , "" he once told a Chinese magazine .
He has described struggling with the fleas , the hard physical labour and the sheer loneliness .
There is , of course , a well - established Communist iconography of learning to serve the people .
But political commentator Li Datong suggests this "" double background "" has proved genuinely formative for princelings such as Xi and might even lead them to bolder policy - making . ""
One aspect is their family background as children of the country 's founders and the other is their experience of being sent to the countryside , which made them understand China 's real situation better .
It gives this generation a strong tradition of idealism and the courage to do something big , "" he said .
Although he has openly criticised the cultural revolution , Xi embraced the party ; in a WikiLeaks cable an academic who knew Xi as a young man suggested he "" chose to survive by becoming redder than red "" .
Family links helped him to win a place studying chemical engineering at the elite Tsinghua University , followed by a post as aide to a powerful military leader , Geng Biao – the beginning of his useful People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) connections .
Next came a more surprising move – his choice , says political expert Zhang Xiaojin – to an unglamorous post in Hebei province .
He may have hoped to shake off suggestions of benefiting from his family name .
It was as deputy secretary of Zhengding county that he visited Muscatine , a US town of 23,000 until now best known for its melons and Mark Twain 's brief sojourn there in 1855 . ""
He was a very polite and kind guy .
I could see someone very devoted to his work –
there was no golfing on that trip
, that 's for sure , "" said Eleanor Dvorchak , who hosted Xi in her son 's old room , where he slept amid football wallpaper and Star Trek figurines .
"" He was serious .
He was a man on a mission . ""
Sarah Lande , who organised the trip , said his confidence was obvious even through a translator .
"" You could tell he was in charge … he seemed relaxed and welcoming and able to handle things , "" she said .
"" He had the words he wanted to express himself easily . ""
The acquaintance who spoke to WikiLeaks claimed Xi always had his "" eye on the prize "" of a major party post .
He transferred to southern Fujian province in 1985 , climbing steadily upwards over 17 years .
Most of his experience has been earned in China 's relatively prosperous , entrepreneurial coastal areas , where he courted investors and built up business , proving willing to adopt new ideas .
The former US treasury secretary Hank Paulson called him "" the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line "" .
After the toppling of Shanghai 's party secretary , Chen Liangyu , in a corruption scandal , Xi took charge of the city in 2007 .
Barely six months later his elevation to the politburo standing committee – the top political body – signalled that he was expected to succeed Hu .
In October 2010 his appointment as vice - chair of the central military commission cemented his position .
He describes his own thinking as pragmatic , and throughout his rise he has cultivated a down - to - earth image ; in the provinces he ate in government canteens and often dressed down .
In a burst of publicity shortly before his 2007 promotion his wife lauded his humble nature and devotion to duty , revealing that on their second date he warned her he would not have much time for family life .
And in a system known for corruption , he also has a clean reputation .
One friend told the LA Times the worst the paper was likely to find were overdue library books .
But while Xi is well - liked and adept at glad - handing , he appears to give little of importance away .
Even his popular wife has retreated into the background as he has assumed increasing prominence .
The US ambassador , Gary Locke , recently observed that he was "" very personable "" but that US officials "" really do n't know that much about him "" .
Close association with particular policies or factions has its dangers .
Becoming general secretary of the party , and thus leader of China , is "" an issue of who opposes you rather than who supports you "" , said Kerry Brown , head of the Asia programme at Chatham House .
Beyond his openness to economic reforms , Xi is known primarily as a figure who appeals to different groupings and as a safe pair of hands . ""
In recent years he has taken care of large - scale events , including Olympics and anniversaries , and there have n't been any big mistakes .
Xi has steadily been through these tests , "" said Zhang .
In 2007 he leapfrogged Li Keqiang – until then seen as likely to succeed Hu , but seen perhaps as too much Hu 's protege – as the consensus candidate in a system built on collective decision - making .
Xi 's networks are unusually broad , according to Brown : "" Provincially ; through his family ; and with the military through Geng Biao .
His elevation is in the interests of the widest group of people and opposed by the smallest group .
"" It is the same relatively small elite who will determine what he can do with the job .
Liberal
Some hope he shares his father 's liberal sympathies :
Xi senior was not only a noted economic reformer , but an ally of reformist leader Hu Yaobang .
Some say he criticised the military crackdown on Tiananmen Square 's pro - democracy protests in 1989 .
They say that grassroots organisations burgeoned during the vice - president 's stint in Zhejiang , and there was progress in the election of independent candidates at local polls .
But the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network has argued the province also saw "" zealous persecution "" of dissidents , underground Christians and activists : "" His track record does not bode well , "" it wrote .
Other China watchers point to shattered hopes that Hu might prove politically liberal .
Nor does Xi 's confidence in overseas dealings necessarily indicate a more emollient approach to foreign relations .
His most - quoted remark to date was made on a trip to Mexico in 2009 : "" There are some well fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than point fingers at our affairs .
China does not , first , export revolution ; second , export poverty and hunger ; third , cause troubles for you .
What else is there to say ?
"" In any case , to read Xi as a man in sole control of the agenda is to fundamentally misunderstand the Chinese political system .
He will be "" first among equals "" in the nine - member standing committee , say analysts .
Hu and other former leaders will still exert influence ; and 2011 's five - year plan has plotted the immediate course .
The system "" is in favour of moderation , and nothing can change quickly .
Steady as it goes .
The political rhythm first has to be installed … significant shifts will come later , "" said Dr David Kelly , director of the Beijing - based political thinktank China Policy .
Some think Xi 's networks may allow him to strike out more confidently than Hu .
Others think he will struggle to win support for bold decisions needed to tackle the country 's mounting challenges .
"" I think he 's a more instinctive and gut - driven politician and may surprise us .
Others say the system and the vested interests around him are too strong , "" said Brown .
His leadership will be shaped by his colleagues and framed by external forces .
"" What 's very important is the capacity to be on the right side of history , "" said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution in Washington .
"" He himself probably does not know what he will do . ""

Career
His father was a revolutionary hero and a steady rise through party ranks , aided by expert networking , is set to take Xi to the very top .
His family background has dogged him at times but also speeded him on his course .
High point
Emerging as heir apparent to Hu Jintao at the 17th party congress in 2007 .
Many had expected Li Keqiang – now expected to become premier – to take the position .
Low point
Coming last in the vote for membership of the central committee in 1997 , amid hostility to princelings .
Connections won him a place as an alternate .
What he says "" Are you trying to give me a fright ? ""
( when asked by a reporter , in 2002 , whether he would be a top leader within the decade ) .
What they say "" He 's more assertive than Hu Jintao .
When he enters the room , you know there is a significant presence here …
[ But ] when they rise through their hierarchy , it serves no purpose to indicate differences or even alternative directions . ""
( Henry Kissinger )"
2012-11-16,"It seems an immutable fact of Chinese life , as true for those outside the country as those inside , that the new leadership should remain as opaque as the old one was .
Xi Jinping 's arrival onto the stage this week added a few shafts of light .
We now know that his predecessor Hu Jintao is going to stand down from his military post , so that Mr Xi will lead the party , the government and the military .
We also learned that two prominent voices for political reform , Wang Yang , the party secretary of the richest province Guangdong , and Li Yuanchao , who called for inter - party democracy , did not make it onto the standing committee of the politburo .
The committee itself was pared back from nine to seven members .
But by the same token , most of the grey bunch are in their mid - sixties and may not last for the full decade .
So this could be a transitional leadership which bears the imprint of Jiang Zemin , who was Hu Jintao 's predecessor , rather than Mr Xi himself .
We know that Mr Xi mentioned the words party 20 times , people 19 times , responsibility 10 times and problems three times .
That is not , in the current jargon of foreign policy analysts , much of a takeaway .
Mr Xi has made strenuous efforts to keep his thoughts to himself .
If he got to the top by being the least threatening figure to a variety of rival interest groups , there is a good bet he will keep it that way until he has the power to strike .
For all the emphasis in his speech on the new leadership 's responsibility to the people , there is nothing either in his history or in the current make - up of the collective leadership to assume that a new Gorbachev is in the making .
Rather the opposite .
Gorbachev was a lesson for the Chinese leadership in how not to reform .
Keeping control is the order of the day , not losing it as Gorbachev did .
But nor can reform be regarded as an afterthought , an addendum on the main agenda of keeping the growth figures up .
It is central to the stability of the state .
And it is intrinsically political .
Take the problem of mid - level government in China .
It has been described as China Inc , in that it is genuinely difficult to tell the difference between a public servant with private interests , and private entrepreneur with public interests .
These bureaucrats have become so tainted that for them the public interest – let alone the rights of groups or individuals – has disappeared altogether .
Demanding that the state make way for the rise of the middle class is in these circumstances rather like drilling a hole in the Three Gorges Dam . Re - establishing the legitimacy of government , and doing this in a stable and evolutionary way , will be Mr Xi 's central challenge ."
2012-12-04,"The western media have followed recent political developments in China with keen interest .
As Hu Jintao and other senior officials handed over to a largely new set of leaders at the Chinese Communist party 's five - yearly National Congress , hopes were higher than ever in the press that the country might turn into a more liberal space .
A significant portion of recent optimism , however , came couched in the well - established western phraseology on China , which has long been dominated by terms like "" unprecedented "" , "" irreversible "" , "" breaking with the past "" and "" losing ( or loosening ) grip "" .
Traditionally , this optimism has come with the assumption that modernity is ultimately a single condition , and that China , like many other countries , is on the brink , or at least the path , of inevitable change , as it continues to embrace capitalism and eventually becomes "" more like us "" .
Sometimes the "" inevitable change "" story emphasises internal pressures , like the creeping effects of urban migration or the role of markets and middle classes as catalysts for greater transparency .
At other times , it emphasises external pressures , such as claims that the more China grows , the more it relies on , and gradually conforms to , international norms and organisations .
As polling by YouGov 's academic thinktank , YouGov - Cambridge , recently showed , at least two other frames dominate British perceptions of China .
In a survey of nearly 1,500 professionals from the UK defence community , 69 % said China 's economic growth model is unsustainable , while 60 % said its political model is unsustainable .
Meanwhile , in a separate survey of the general British public , 47 % said that China would be the world 's leading power in 20 years ' time , with only 14 % saying it would be the United States ( and 22 % saying they do n't know ) .
In other words , a popular theory among UK foreign policy professionals is that the current China story ca n't last , while the most popular public view is that it 's on course for global pre - eminence .
But what if China is steering between all of these futures – of inevitable change , collapse and pre - eminence ? Observers are right to note that Chinese leaders face "" unprecedented "" tests .
The kind of new challenges that China is facing are likely to multiply old problems , such as severe income inequities and urban - rural divides ; displaced populations and internal migrant underclasses ; endemic corruption and a sham banking sector ; the double - dipping of Communist leaders between authoritarian privilege and semi - free markets ; endless environmental and related health crises ; and a growth model intractably wedded to the monetary headache of sterilised intervention .
China - watchers are equally correct that its leaders have recently talked seriously and more publicly than ever about political reform .
But a dissonance in east - west vocabulary has also led many outsiders to confuse what this means with what it does n't .
Reform in the Chinese Communist party is less a synonym for change and more a bulwark against it , and any challenge to one - party rule .
Key figures such as the outgoing prime minister , Wen Jiabao , have discussed the need to embrace new forms of competitive elections and democratic process ( so much that he was even censored ) .
But Wen was also clear that these possibilities point no further than adapting "" within - system processes "" , or what the country 's current top legislator , Wu Bangguo ,
has called "" consultation under central leadership "" , meaning a kind of intra - party democratic process whose aim is exactly to stave off wider democracy , rather than embrace any part of it .
Optimists could yet be vindicated through big - bang change or incremental liberalisation , and a recent clampdown on ping pong balls and taxi door - handles in Beijing during the National Congress highlighted the state 's insecurity .
But unrest and online empowerment in 21st - century China also come with important caveats .
Dissent today regularly differs from the Tiananmen generation of 20 years ago .
As in any political system , middle - class expansion has been accompanied by progressive demands for more and better services , and greater expectation of access to opportunity .
Many of these activists are different from the students who built their own Statue of Liberty to the sound of Bruce Springsteen .
They might obsess about shoddy officials or services , but crucially not the system or its leaders .
Swaths of the professional class have traded political engagement for economic opportunity , and without their support the endless working - class outbreaks of labour unrest have remained consistently localised and disconnected .
The party has also learned to tolerate some degree of criticism towards performance , which can perversely reinforce the state 's ultimate responsibilities – and therefore legitimacy – of government .
In addition , the American roots of the recent financial crisis have strengthened the party 's claim that capitalism in the age of globalisation is better guided by hands - on planning than hands - off liberalism .
Western and particularly American futurologists have tended to see gradualism and inevitability in every example of Chinese political flexibility or compromise .
But the fact remains that Beijing has overseen more than three decades of sustained growth without losing political control .
Continued stability has precisely been underpinned by flexibility , or what a Chinese intelligence officer once described to this writer as a "" bamboo strategy "" – of bending to popular winds rather than standing straight and breaking like China 's late ideological cousins in Moscow .
So the next time you read a story that puts China on historical brinks or inevitable paths , take it with a pinch of salt ."
2013-03-04,"When China 's most powerful men gathered for the start of its formal power shift last November , six names merited a mention in the outgoing leader Hu Jintao 's work report .
Five were obvious choices , identified by their philosophical legacies and contributions to the Communist party : Marx , Lenin , Mao and Hu 's predecessors Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin .
The sixth was a man unknown before his untimely death and celebrated not for leading the way but obediently following : Lei Feng .
The humble soldier and Mao - era icon popped up again just before Tuesday 's opening of the National People 's Congress , which will complete the leadership transition .
On Friday the ideological chief Liu Yunshan urged people to learn from Lei 's example , strengthening their love for party and country and helping to build "" the socialist core value system "" .
Tuesday is the annual Learn from Lei Feng day and this year marks the 50th anniversary of the first such campaign .
Propaganda chiefs said his inspirational diary was discovered after his accidental death at 21 , though others are sceptical about its veracity .
Through its dissemination , he began an afterlife as the epitome of selflessness , socialist spirit and devotion to Mao .
Children and adults across the country were urged to emulate his deeds , such as sharing meagre savings with the needy or gathering dung to use as fertiliser .
Since then he has been used by authorities with varying degrees of enthusiasm .
Tao Dongfeng , professor in cultural studies at Beijing Normal University , said his latest resurgence reflected growing concern about disintegrating social bonds .
In the work report , he was hailed in a new section on improving civic morality .
"" From the top to the bottom of society , we all feel morality has declined , "" said Tao , citing the public despair last year when a video showed passers by ignoring a two - year - old who had been crushed by a truck .
"" They hope to change the situation through Lei Feng . ""
The senior engineer who died after watching the jet fighter he had developed land safely on an aircraft carrier was "" in step with Lei Feng "" in his devotion to duty .
A policeman believed to have drowned this week while attempting to save a tourist 's life was described as a modern Lei Feng for his altruism .
In recent months Lei has been invoked in schools across the country and has gazed down on Guangzhou 's glitziest shopping street from an electronic billboard .
Over the years there have been Lei Feng video games and ( without official endorsement ) even condoms .
These days he is glossed by state media as a depoliticised Good Samaritan .
But Tao pointed out that the first campaign began as Mao faced growing criticism inside the party over the disaster of the Great Famine .
The most important feature of Lei is that he "" absolutely obeys the party , and Mao Zedong
…
He lacks independent thinking and reflection , "" said Tao .
Fuller reading of the diary also shows that "" he divided the people into different classes : revolutionary , anti - revolutionary ; class friends or class enemies …
Some of his words are very dirty and brutal . ""
Even the softer side of Lei can be a hard sell to younger generations .
Famously , he said his only ambition was "" to be a rustless screw "" in the revolutionary cause – an odd sentiment in an individualistic age . ""
Of course , times have changed .
We can not require young people to darn socks as Lei Feng did [ for his comrades ] or simply help the old to cross the road , "" said Tan Huangfang , who spent 26 years as a guide at the Changsha Lei Feng museum and said the soldier had inspired her throughout her life . ""
However , we can require young people to be warm - hearted , honest people . ""
But others , like Tao , say civic education is a better basis for social morality than ideology .
Some are simply turned off by the glaring discrepancies in the official account – such as the numerous , professional - quality photographs that mysteriously captured every good deed by a then anonymous soldier . ""
A couple of years ago , I read something online and realised some of the Lei Feng story was fake or made up by the propaganda people , so in my mind the credibility of those heroes we studied in school declined , "" said Chris Liu , a student in Beijing .
"" Nowadays , Chinese people are very selfish .
It 's good to promote this spirit to keep society harmonious
…
I just do n't like how the Communist party promotes him as propaganda . ""

2014-12-22,"Chinese anti - corruption authorities have placed Ling Jihua , a top aide to the former president Hu Jintao , under investigation for graft , state media reported .
Ling , 58 , is under investigation for “ suspected serious disciplinary violation
” – almost always shorthand for corruption –
the state newswire Xinhua said in a terse report , without giving further details .
Ling , 58 , is one of the highest - ranking Communist party officials to be caught up in President Xi Jinping ’s anti - corruption drive , the most intense and wide - ranging in China ’s recent history .
Analysts say the campaign has allowed Xi to consolidate power by undermining rivals while concurrently improving the party ’s public image .
This month , anti - corruption authorities formally arrested the former security tsar Zhou Yongkang , the country ’s highest - ranking official to be prosecuted in more than three decades .
In the spring of 2012 , months before Xi would replace Hu in a once - in - a - decade leadership transition , Ling ’s 23 year - old son Ling Gu crashed a Ferrari while joyriding in Beijing , killing himself and seriously injuring two women .
Ling allegedly attempted to engineer a coverup , and fallout from the scandal changed the dynamics of the transition , allowing Xi to replace many of Hu ’s top allies with his own .
From 2007 until 2012 , Ling directed the party ’s general office , an administrative body with close ties to China ’s top leaders .
Analysts believed that Hu was grooming him for advancement to the party ’s seven - person politburo standing committee , its highest decision - making body .
After the crash , Ling was given a less - vaunted post as head of the United Front Work Department , a government agency that oversees ethnic minority relations , crushing his chances of promotion .
Ling was born in a coalmining region of northern China ’s Shanxi province , and joined the party when he was 20 .
He quickly ascended the ranks as Hu ’s protege and a member of the Communist Youth League , a prominent party faction .
“
The question is not so much why Ling Jihua was in trouble , it ’s why it took so long for Ling Jihua to get into trouble , ” said Steve Tsang , an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham .
“
And I think the most likely explanation was that Xi Jinping needed the support of the Communist Youth League and Hu Jintao [ to bring down Zhou Yongkang ] , so basically left Ling Jihua alone .
It was a very pragmatic move .
”
Anti - graft authorities tightened the net around Ling in recent months , placing several of his former associates and two of his brothers under investigation .
One of the brothers , Ling Zhengce , was a high - ranking official in Shanxi ; the other , Ling Wancheng , was an elite businessman and amateur golfer ."
2015-10-19,"Xi Jinping , the president of China , is to make his first state visit to Britain this week , 10 years after the last official visit by a Chinese leader .
The visit , from 20 - 23 October , has been lauded as establishing a “ golden era ” of bilateral relations , and comes a week after George Osborne , the chancellor , visited China to strengthen economic and financial ties .
The last visit by a Chinese head of state was when Hu Jintao came in 2005 and met with a raucous protest by Tibetan and human rights campaigners .
Though there are disagreements over China ’s human rights records and the former British colony of Hong Kong , the Treasury hopes China will become Britain ’s second - biggest trade partner within a decade .
Xi and his wife , Peng Liyuan , have been invited to stay at Buckingham Palace and will enjoy a state banquet hosted by the Queen .
But amid the pomp and ceremony , there will also be protests .
The week ’s events include : Tuesday 20 October Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will greet the president and his wife at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel , before travelling to Horse Guards Parade for the ceremonial welcome .
A guard of honour will greet the pair at about noon on the Mall , which is decked in the flags of China and the UK .
The Chinese national anthem will be played and presentations made , as the Queen and Prince Philip accompany Xi and Peng in a state carriage procession to Buckingham Palace , where the president and first lady will lunch with the Queen and view items from the Royal Collection in the picture gallery of the palace .
Meanwhile , Amnesty International and othergroups will protest in St James ’s Park over the human rights violations in China , such as censorship , curbs on civil society and detention of human rights lawyers and activists ..
Demonstrators will hold placards and banners with slogans in both Chinese and English with messages such as : “ Rights over revenue ” and “ People before profit ” .
Xi will address the Houses of Commons and Lords at Westminster in the afternoon .
He will then meet Jeremy Corbyn , the Labour leader .
The private meeting was arranged to prevent an embarrassing semi - public challenge by Corbyn on China ’s human rights record during the ceremonial dinner , reports say .
Later , Xi and Peng will meet Charles and Camilla at Clarence House , after seeing work by students at the Prince ’s School of Traditional Arts .
The Queen will then host a state banquet for Xi and Peng .
Also present will be Philip , Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge , and politicians including David Cameron and Corbyn .
Xi and the Queen will make short speeches .
Wednesday 21 October The president is scheduled to visit Imperial College London with George Osborne , the chancellor , and Prince Andrew on the second day of his visit .
Xi will also meet William and Kate at an event at Lancaster House celebrating the partnership of the two nations , in which companies in the creative industries will be announcing new collaborations in film , TV and entertainment .
Xi will meet Cameron at Downing Street before attending the UK - China business summit at Mansion House where the focus will be on investment , infrastructure and innovation .
Afterwards , he will visit Huawei Technologies , a leading Chinese telecommunications company , followed by a banquet hosted by the Lord Mayor and the City of London at the Guildhall .
Xi is expected to use his speech at Guildhall to set out how he hopes to make London the global centre for offshore Chinese finance .
Thursday 22 October
The Chinese president will receive a formal farewell from the Queen and Philip at Buckingham Palace on the third day of his visit .
Xi will then continue with his trip , visiting Inmarsat , a British satellite telecommunications company , and later attend a conference of the Confucius Institute , the Chinese equivalent of the British Council , hosted by University College London ’s Institute of Education .
Later , Xi and Peng will join Cameron and his wife at Chequers for dinner before flying to Manchester .
Friday 23 October
On his final day of his state visit , Xi is scheduled to visit the National Graphene Institute at Manchester University with Osborne .
Xi and the prime minister will then meet at Manchester City ’s stadium , followed by lunch at Manchester town hall hosted by Paul Murphy , the Lord Mayor of Manchester , and attended by civic and business representatives .
Both leaders will then attend an event at Manchester airport , before the lord chamberlain , the senior official of the royal household , bids farewell to the Chinese president and first lady before their departure ."
2015-10-19,"Drummers from pro - China groups have been told that they can not play in the royal park near Buckingham Palace , where the Chinese president , Xi Jingping , will arrive on Tuesday .
While drums were used on the last occasion of a Chinese leader ’s visit to the UK to drown out pro - democracy and Tibet protesters , regulations governing the playing of instruments in royal parks mean that they will not be allowed to ramp up the decibels .
The drummers are expected to be among those taking part in rival protestsfor the first official visit by a Chinese head of state since Hu Jintao in 2005 .
Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan arrived late last night at Heathrow airport , where they were greeted on behalf of the Queen by Viscount Hood and by the foreign secretary , Philip Hammond .
Hundreds of protesters from the ranks of Amnesty International , pro - Tibetan groups and other Chinese dissident groups are planning to gather in St James ’s Park on Tuesday morning before Xi is driven along the Mall to Buckingham Palace , where he is scheduled to attend a banquet .
The royal parks policy on protests inside their grounds stipulates that “ no entertainment or other performances may take place ” .
A spokesperson said : “ The royal parks have a long history of accommodating peaceful public protests .
We usually only allow protests in Hyde Park but in exceptional circumstances we will consider applications for demonstrations elsewhere providing they adhere to the park regulations .
But we must not lose sight that these are public parks , primarily places for recreation , and we must ensure they are managed in a way that caters for all park users .
”
In addition to the larger groups organised by Amnesty and other pro - democracy organisations , the anti - Xi protests are expected to be bolstered by demonstrations staged by smaller groups such as those representing members of China ’s ethnic Uighur population from the restive Xinjiang region .
Among those planning to join the protests is Shao Jiang , who was involved in the Chinese student movements during the 80s and who helped to draft a list of demands in 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests .
He told the Guardian that the demonstrations in London were very important but suggested the British authorities had been guilty of “ double standards ” in the past when it came to the policing of such events .
“
From my experience of policing in Britain , there has been a problem .
For example , human rights protesters have been told that they can not use megaphones , but they have allowed Chinese pro - government groups to use drums , ” he said .
“
We also remember when the Olympic torch was making its way through the streets of the UK ahead of China hosting the games .
Protesters were kettled by police , and yet supporters of China were allowed to walk freely .
”
Joshua Wong , an 18-year - old Hong Kong student leader and pro - democracy activist who is currently in London , said that the protests were important at a time when China was arresting more human rights activists .
“
We hope to let Xi know that it is not possible to arrest people all over the world , ” said Wong , one of the most prominent faces of Hong Kong ’s so - called umbrella movement .
“
However , the most important thing is the attitude of the British prime minister .
He needs to raise the issue .
Otherwise Xi will continue to focus on the core issue of investment .
”
Scotland Yard said in a statement late on Monday that it has been planning for the Chinese state visit for more than five months .
It added : “ We have been engaging with a variety of groups that have stated their intention to demonstrate during the visit of the Chinese president .
Where there are demonstrations , officers from the Police Liaison Team will be on the ground to engage with protestors .
An appropriate policing plan will be in place throughout the duration of the visit .
”
It added that a planned demonstration and a counter demonstration are due to take place near the George VI memorial in St James ’s Park , north of the Mall , between 11 am and 1 pm on Tuesday .
Also expected to protest are representatives of Falun Gong , the spiritual sect banned by China in 1999 as a cult and severely repressed ever since .
The day before the Communist leader begins his four - day state visit , representatives from human rights groups gathered in the Palace of Westminster for a “ stateless lunch
” – held as an alternative to the state banquet the Queen is hosting for Xi at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening .
The UK director of Human Rights Watch , David Mepham , called on David Cameron to press for reform amid accusations of a further decline in human rights in China .
“
Since President Xi came to power three years ago , human rights conditions in the People ’s Republic of China have deteriorated alarmingly , ” he said .
“
David Cameron should speak out strongly and publicly against these abuses , urge far - reaching reform , and press for the release of all those activists , lawyers and journalists so unjustly imprisoned .
“
This is a moral duty , but also in our interests .
China ’s repression , pervasive corruption , its flawed judicial system and rampant impunity –
these are a grave threat to China ’s stability and economy .
And that matters to all of us .
”
The gathering was hosted by Labour MP Fabian Hamilton , who is chair of the all party parliamentary group for Tibet .
One of the largest groupings of protesters are expected to gather around the Free Tibet campaign , which is demonstrating against China ’s long occupation of the Himalayan territory and subsequent rights abuses there .
More Tibetans would also protest outside the state banquet , according to Alistair Currie from the Free Tibet campaign .
He hailed a promise by the Labour leader , Jeremy Corbyn , to raise the issue of human rights with Xi , saying : “ It ’s very welcome that it looks like someone is going to be raising human rights directly to Xi Jinping .
The UK government says they raise issues in private , but we had a meeting with them earlier this week and they would not commit to anything that was going to happen .
”"
2015-10-20,"Xi Jinping is in the UK for the first state visit to Britain by a Chinese head of state in 10 years .
Hu Jintao , Xi ’s predecessor , visited the country in 2005 , when Tony Blair was prime minister .
This visit reciprocates several made by Conservative politicians to China .
David Cameron led a trade mission to Asia ’s biggest economy in 2013 and George Osborne was there just last month .
The Chinese government is targeting economic growth of 7 % this year , the lowest in over two decades .
This follows a crisis over the devaluation of China ’s currency and was followed by a stock - market crash .
But that did not seem to dent the UK chancellor ’s enthusiasm for a deepening of Sino - British ties and Osborne has called the impact on other economies “ relatively limited ” .
Several infrastructure projects the government is pushing for rely on Chinese investment .
The most notable is the new Hinckley Point nuclear power station , which Osborne talked about during his visit to China .
Chinese companies invested $ 5.1bn ( £ 3.29bn ) in the UK during 2014 , according to Baker McKenzie and the Rhodium Group .
This is more than they spent in any other major European economy .
One of the more notable deals was the purchase of Pizza Express by private equity firm Hony Capital .
Between 2000 and 2014 , Chinese investment in Britain totalled $ 16bn compared with $ 8.4bn in Germany , $ 8bn in France , $ 6.7bn in Portugal and $ 5.6bn in Italy .
The UK government also has ambitious targets when it comes to trade .
Osborne envisions China as the UK ’s second largest trading partner after the US by 2025 .
More UK products are making their way to China than ever before , with 4.8 % of British goods exported there in 2014 , up from 1.3 % in 2004 .
However , this is still considerably behind the US ( 12.8 % ) , Germany ( 10.6 % ) and the Netherlands ( 7.9 % ) .
But while exports elsewhere have flatlined , those to China continue to grow .
UK imports from China have increased a lot faster than exports .
Britain ’s trade deficit with the Asian country in 2014 was £ 19.5 m .
When only looking at goods , that figure increases to £ 22.5 m , which is second only in the world to Germany .
Part of the way to change that is to make Britain a place that it is easier for Chinese companies to trade with .
On his trade mission to China in 2013 , David Cameron said that French and German language classes should be snubbed in favour of Mandarin .
The number of pupils taking Chinese GCSE has begun to increase again after a drop off in 2012 , which was largely due to many switching to the alternative ICGSE qualification .
Britain and China have also announced a plan that would lead to stocks on the Shanghai market being traded in London and vice versa .
Although the UK is n’t the most exposed of the G7 ’s main economies to a slowdown in China , a significant decline in Chinese imports could lead to a substantial loss for the British economy ."
2016-02-12,"A politically connected Chinese businessman living in the US in murky circumstances has denied he gave American authorities state secrets including nuclear launch codes – insisting that he is only interested in “ golf secrets
” .
Ling Wancheng , brother of a disgraced former top aide to ex - Chinese president Hu Jintao , was the subject of media reports that he had been debriefed by US officials and provided nuclear secrets as well as personal information about Chinese leaders .
His case has generated intense interest in China and the US because of the access Ling Wancheng ’s brother , Ling Jihua , once had to the inner workings of China ’s Communist party leadership .
US officials have consistently declined to answer questions about Ling Wancheng , including whether he has applied for asylum and whether he has been debriefed by government agents .
An official said the State Department regularly engaged with China on law enforcement matters , and China had raised a number of specific cases of concern .
China is said to have sought his return to face prosecution amid a general crackdown on corruption and dissent ordered by President Xi Jinping .
In January , Liu Jianchao , an official with the Communist party ’s anti - graft watchdog , said : “
As for the case of Ling Wancheng , the Chinese side is handling it and is communicating with the United States .
”
In July 2015 China said it would prosecute Ling Jihua , a one - time senior aide to Hu , after an investigation found that he took bribes and engaged in other corrupt behaviour .
Another brother , Ling Zhengce , was also accused of corruption .
Gregory S Smith , a Washington attorney , told Reuters he had been retained by Ling Wancheng .
He declined to say whether his client had applied for asylum or been in contact and whether he was talking to US authorities .
“
The absurd rumours that he is in possession of a large number of secrets , including keyboard nuclear codes , and rumours that he has handed over state secrets to the US government , reported by media outlets , is a baseless lie and a groundless defamation , and he reserves his right through me to take action as appropriate , ” said Smith , in a statement approved by his client .
Smith added that his client , an avid golfer , “ came to the US to share golf secrets , not state secrets ” .
Ling Wancheng ’s
older brother , Ling Jihua , was once head of the Communist party ’s General Office of the Central Committee , a powerful job similar to that of a cabinet secretary in western Westminster - style governments .
In that position he would have had access to information about the Chinese government ’s inner workings .
Ling Jihua was expelled from the party in 2015 , becoming one of the highest - profile targets of an anti - corruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping .
Ling Jihua is now awaiting trial on bribery and other charges .
“
One presumes he [ Ling Wancheng ] is a valuable asset , ” said Christopher K Johnson , a former senior CIA China analyst who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
“
His brother was certainly in a very sensitive position in China , and would have had access to some very sensitive information .
How much and to what degree did he pass this information on to his brother ?
That is the big question .

2016-05-13,"More than four years after a high - speed Ferrari crash precipitated his fall from grace , the gatekeeper to the former Chinese president faces court , accused of taking “ massive ” bribes and illegally obtaining state secrets .
Ling Jihua , 59 , served as the top aide to China ’s then president and Communist party chief ,
Hu Jintao , from 2007 to 2012 , when he was demoted after his son was killed in a horrific and scandalous road accident .
He was officially placed under investigation in December 2014 for “ suspected serious disciplinary violations ” as President Xi Jinping , Hu ’s successor , conducted a major purge of political rivals and allegedly corrupt members of the Communist party .
China ’s official news agency , Xinhua , announced on Friday that the disgraced official would be tried in Tianjin , a city about about 90 miles south - east of Beijing .
China ’s supreme people ’s procuratorate , the state prosecuting body , said Ling would be accused of using his position to solicit bribes , seeking favours for friends and illegally obtaining state secrets .
Those crimes had inflicted serious damage on “ the interests of the country and the people , ” it said .
Ling is one of the highest profile targets of the anti - corruption campaign launched by Xi following his rise to power in late 2012 .
Steve Tsang , a China expert from the University of Nottingham ’s school of contemporary Chinese studies , said there was no doubt he would be found guilty by the party - controlled court .
The question was why it had taken so long for China ’s top leadership to allow the case to come to trial .
Tsang said one explanation might be that “ Xi [ was ] playing a balancing game between major factions within the Communist party ” in order to secure his position and had been reluctant to move against Ling , because of his links to the powerful Communist Youth League faction .
Tsang said Xi had wasted little time in moving against the jailed party titans Bo Xilai and Zhou Yongkang , who were linked to the former president Jiang Zemin .
But he had so far been “ relatively light - handed ” with those with ties to his immediate successor Hu , who is one of the key players in the Youth League .
The decision to put Ling on trial indicated that China ’s president now felt “ comfortable enough to get this resolved and is not worried about the backlash ” from political rivals , Tsang added .
Ling ’s downfall began in early 2012 following one of the most mysterious and embarrassing episodes in the recent history of the Communist party .
In the early hours of 18 March that year , a black Ferrari 458 Spider , driven by his 23-year - old son Ling Gu , smashed into a wall on Beijing ’s fourth ring road , killing the driver and exposing the vast wealth of China ’s political elite .
One of two semi - clothed women in the vehicle later died of her injuries .
Subsequent reports suggested a major coverup operation as officials close to Ling battled to prevent word of the crash leaking out .
According to one account , reported by the New York Times , Ling Jihua visited the Beijing mortuary where his son ’s corpse was being held but “ coldly denied it was his son ” .
Hong Kong ’s South China Morning Post reported claims that millions of pounds had been taken from the coffers of China ’s biggest oil company and used in an attempt to hush up the family of the two female passengers .
Tsang said it was not clear if Ling had already been “ a blip
” on Xi ’s radar before the Ferrari accident .
But investigators appeared to have locked on to him in its wake , deciding :
“
OK , we ’ll get this guy , ” he said .
Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Ling ’s brother Ling Wancheng is currently in the US , where some claim he has leaked top secret Communist party files , including nuclear launch codes .
Ling Wancheng ’s US lawyer has dismissed those allegations as “ absurd rumours ” , claiming his client left China “ to share golf secrets , not state secrets ” , but experts say he could represent one of the most damaging Chinese defectors since Chairman Mao Zedong founded the People ’s Republic of China in 1949 .
Tsang said Ling was unlikely to be the last senior official to fall victim to Xi ’s
“ party rectification ” campaign .
“
I would n’t see Ling Jihua as the last of the big tigers , ” he said .
“
Xi Jinping ca n’t afford to stop .
Until he has sufficiently consolidated his position so that when he stops he knows there is not going to be that clawback by the others , he ca n’t stop .
And I have n’t seen evidence to suggest that he has got anywhere near [ that ] stage . ”"
