2006-01-11,"The Republicans Roy Blunt of Missouri and John Boehner of Ohio have emerged as the two men vying to replace Tom DeLay as majority leader in the US House of Representatives .
The house majority leader plays a crucial role in shepherding through the legislative agenda , working with the minority leader , the White House and the Senate .
Mr DeLay enjoyed a formidable reputation for getting things done on Capitol Hill .
He stepped down after being indicted for money laundering by a Texas grand jury last October .
He had hoped to get his job back when the house returned from its break at the end of January .
But Mr DeLay 's problems deepened after Jack Abramoff , the super - lobbyist and central figure in an influence - peddling scandal , pleaded guilty to criminal corruption .
With his close ties to Mr Abramoff , Mr DeLay 's position became untenable and he renounced any intention to return to his old job .
Mr Blunt and Mr Boehner are currently busy trying to drum up as much support as possible , releasing the names of supporters in the house , in an effort to quickly wrap up the race .
Some Republicans are not so sure that is a good idea .
Representatives Charles Bass and Jeff Flake , who drew up the petition last week that forced Mr DeLay to step down permanently , have urged their colleagues not to commit themselves publicly to any candidate .
They pointed out that neither of the two candidates had committed themselves to root - and - branch reform of a system that spawned the Abramoff scandal . ""
Elections that appear to be foregone conclusions do not advance the reformist agenda many of us pledged to uphold to our constituents , "" their letter said .
Those concerns are well - placed .
Mr Blunt , 55 , and Mr Boehner , 58 , were both at the heart of the Republican money machine Mr DeLay had built up .
A Bloomberg article provides extensive details of the two men 's extensive ties to lobbyists .
Both men 's political action committees ( Pacs ) , which exist to raise money , employ Jim Ellis , who was indicted along with Mr DeLay .
Both of their Pacs also employed Alexander Strategy , a Washington firm whose partners include former Abramoff and DeLay associates .
Mr Blunt , who has been acting majority leader since Mr DeLay stepped down , has also served as the Republicans ' official liaison to K Street , the favoured location of lobbyists .
As recently as last April , Mr Blunt organised a meeting between some 200 lobbyists to discuss the party 's agenda with top Republicans , including the Senate majority leader , Bill Frist .
Mr Boehner is believed to be closer to lobbyists than Mr Blunt .
Bloomberg reports that in 1995 , Mr Boehner handed out campaign cheques from the tobacco industry to members on the house floor at a time when representatives were considering a tobacco subsidy .
If either Mr Blunt and Mr Boehner succeeds Mr DeLay the question arises whether it would be anything other than business as usual ."
2008-01-24,"Democrats and Republicans in Congress have hammered out a deal for a $ 150bn stimulus package to inject momentum into America 's faltering economy .
Under pressure from the White House for swift action , leaders from both parties have agreed in principle to tax rebates which amount to between $ 300 and $ 600 per person .
The agreement was announced by the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican leader in the House of Representatives , John Boehner .
It was welcomed by President Bush , who said : "" This package has the right set of policies and is the right size .
It will lead to higher consumer spending and more business incentives this year .
"" The Democrats won a concession that even those too poor to pay income taxes would be included , although they agreed to drop demands for increases in unemployment benefits and food stamps .
Under the details , some 117 m families will get rebate cheques which are expected to be sent out within ten weeks .
But couples with joint incomes of more than $ 175,000 will not be eligible .
In an effort to help homeowners struggling with subprime mortgages , the bipartisan deal includes measures allowing the government - sponsored finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to take greater action in refinancing home loans .
The two firms will be allowed to buy loans worth up to $ 625,000 rather than the existing $ 417,000 .
Steny Hoyer , the House majority leader , said the measures would provide an "" immediate shot in the arm "" for the economy .
"" We are disappointed , however , that our Republican colleagues ruled out including an extension of unemployment insurance benefits and increasing food stamps in this package - provisions that would provide an immediate bang for the buck and help stimulate our economy , "" he said .
The AFL - CIO union federation added a voice of concern .
Its legislative director , Bill Samuel , suggested that the process had been "" hijacked by business interests "" and would not help the worst off in society .
The stimulus package contributed to a positive mood on Wall Street .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 108 points at 12,378 .
However , fresh evidence of the severity of America 's economic problems emerged in annual housing figures which showed the sharpest drop in home sales for 25 years .
The National Association of Realtors reported a 13 % decline in transactions and a 1.8 % fall in house prices during 2007 - the first full - year decline in property prices since records began in 1968 .
Concern continues to surround the fate of leading financial insurance companies such as Ambac and MBIA , which provide guarantees to investors against defaults by trading partners .
Shares in Ambac ended the day down 17 % and MBIA fell by 13 % .
New York state 's insurance superintendent , Eric Dinallo , is brokering a bail - out package to prevent the firms from losing their credit status .
But he warned that it would be a slow process : "" it must be understood that these are complicated issues involving a number of parties and any effective plan will take some time to finalize . """
2008-09-29,"Angry Republican leaders blamed Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives , last night for shattering a mood of bipartisan cooperation and destroying the US government 's $ 700bn financial bail - out package .
Keen to shake off responsibility for failing to deliver votes from their own members , embarrassed Republicans said a feisty speech by Pelosi had been so offensive that some of their number shifted sides and voted against the plan at the last moment .
"" I do believe we could have got there today , had it not been for this partisan speech that the Speaker gave on the floor of the House , "" said John Boehner , the Republican leader in the House .
A 68-year - old San Francisco liberal , Pelosi is known for being outspoken : in the past , she has raised eyebrows by bluntly describing George Bush as "" incompetent "" .
In her speech to the House yesterday , she delivered a broadside against seven years of "" budgetary recklessness "" by the White House for creating America 's economic mess .
"" When was the last time someone asked you for $ 700bn ? "" she asked .
"" It is a number that is staggering , but tells us only the costs of the Bush administration 's failed economic policies - policies built on budgetary recklessness , on an anything goes mentality with no regulation , no supervision and no discipline in the system . ""
Pulling few punches , Pelosi said her party believed in the free market - but the market had "" created chaos "" because it had been left entirely to its own devices .
"" It is our responsibility today to help avert that catastrophic outcome , "" she said .
Pelosi is the third most senior politician in the US , ranking behind the vice - president , Dick Cheney , in the line of succession for the presidency .
An Italian - American mother of five and a grandmother of six , she is the first woman to have held the office of Speaker .
She is disliked by many on the right who view her as the essence of California liberalism : pro - choice , pro - gay and anti - war .
But others say that since taking office when the Democrats took control of Congress two years ago , she has shown notes of moderation by consistently blocking efforts to impeach Bush .
Railing against her words yesterday , the Republican whip , Eric Cantor , said Pelosi had "" frankly struck a tone of partisanship that was inappropriate in this discussion "" .
He continued : "" There is a reason that this vote failed - and that is Speaker Pelosi 's speech . ""
A fellow Republican , Roy Blunt , suggested that a dozen congressmen from his own party had changed their minds after hearing Pelosi 's words .
But the Speaker was quickly backed by her colleagues who accused Republicans of casting around for a scapegoat to cover their own humiliation in being defied by two - thirds of their own party .
"" I 'm appalled that because somebody hurt their feelings , they decided to punish the entire country , "" said Barney Frank , Democratic chairman of the House financial services committee .
"" I would not have imputed that degree of pettiness and hyper - sensitivity . ""
Rahm Emmanuel , chairman of the Democratic caucus in the House , said nobody should be "" pointing fingers "" given the seriousness of the economic warnings descending upon Congress .
The outbreak of hostilities came after a weekend of rare cooperation in which leaders from both parties burned midnight oil in an attempt to strike a deal which could be supported by their backbenchers .
At one stage late on Saturday night , the two parties met in Pelosi 's office over a platter of pizza and sandwiches to try to come to agreement .
To many observers , Republicans appeared to be the architects of yesterday 's defeat .
Some 60 % of Democrats voted for the bail - out , compared with only a third of the Republicans in Congress .
But Pelosi was not the only person whom rightwingers attempted to blame .
On the presidential campaign trail , John McCain said that it was time to "" fix the problem "" rather than apportion responsibility .
But his chief economic adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , accused Barack Obama of failing to get involved in negotiations to fashion an acceptable package .
"" Barack Obama failed to lead , phoned it in , attacked John McCain , and refused to even say if he supported the bill , "" said Holtz - Eakin .
The Obama campaign reacted with irritation .
A spokesman for Obama said the Republicans ' "" angry and hyper - partisan "" utterances were exactly why Americans are "" disgusted with Washington "" . ""
Now is the time for Democrats and Republicans to join together and act in a way that prevents an economic catastrophe , "" Obama 's camp said ."
2009-02-27,"At CPAC , John Boehner is a rock star .
The Republican House minority leader was introduced by Americans for Tax Reform activist - in - chief Grover Norquist Friday morning as the "" next speaker of the House of Representatives "" , and by the time the Ohio congressman was done speaking , that seemed a little less improbable .
Boehner spoke to a nearly full ballroom at the Omni Shoreham in Washington , eliciting applause and boos at the right times .
When he finished , about half of the people filed out rather than stay and listen to his counterpart in the Senate , the owlish Mitch McConnell .
The emcee suggested that if that had n't fired attendees up , they might want to "" get some more coffee "" .
Boehner began with his biography : "" I have 11 brothers and sisters , and my dad owned a bar . ""
He sold himself as an all - American Ohio boy who had played high - school football under the legendary coach Gerry Faust , grown into a businessman , gotten involved in local politics and "" ended up in the United States Congress "" .
After a beat , Boehner warned : "" This too could happen to you . ""
Boehner is a scoundrel , which leavens his earnestness .
He once passed out campaign donation checks from tobacco companies to fellow congressmen on the floor of the House to help sway a vote .
Where most politicians try not to give offence , Boehner is willing to say things such as : "" [ Democrats ] even want to pay your irresponsible neighbours ' mortgages off for them . ""
He has good , Sam Donaldson - looking hair and tanned skin .
His voice is deep from years of cigar smoke .
And , right now , he 's leading the opposition against President Obama 's entire legislative agenda .
He said that as he read page after page of the stimulus bill : "" All that I think was , Oh .
My .
God . ""
At CPAC , Boehner called the stimulus only the "" opening salvo "" in an a full - out assault on American economic freedoms , followed by the omnibus appropriations bill with "" 9,000 earmarks in it , "" and an even worse proposed budget .
He said that one Democratic congressman voted "" present "" on the stimulus bill because "" that 's how President Obama used to vote when he had to vote on lousy bills "" , and held up his own party for the contrast : "" We all voted no . ""
The minority leader recounted some of his theatrics leading up to the stimulus vote .
He embarrassed the Democratic leadership into stripping out hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for condoms .
He repeatedly pointed out that none of those congressmen who voted for the bill had actually read it .
He threw a copy of the whole bill to the floor of the House to make a point , a gesture that some called "" disrespectful "" .
Boehner labelled the stimulus a "" gravy train for leftwing pork "" and pledged that he would work hard to make sure that taxpayers know how "" every dime "" is spent .
He also promised that the GOP would n't merely be a "" party of no "" but a party that will develop its own counter - proposals to help beat the Obama budget , which he called a "" job killer , plain and simple "" .
It became clear that Boehner views his fight with the White House as a war of attrition , and so far he 's doing a good job keeping House Republicans on his side .
He suggested many Democrats are already wavering in their support for Obama 's regulation and spending policies , and predicted that Obama 's budget is "" just not going to happen "" .
The conservative audience applauded heartily , then went to get coffee ."
2009-03-22,"Spring has come to Washington DC and , with it , the sickly sweet smell of scandal . ""
Who knew what and when did they know it ? ""
roared the House Republican leader , John Boehner , last week .
At the White House 's daily briefing , agitated reporters besieged the press secretary , Robert Gibbs , with similar questions : "" Has the president been satisfied that he found out about this in a timely manner ? "" asked one .
"" Somebody clearly dropped the ball , "" sniped another . ""
Let 's be fair , let 's be fair , "" Gibbs pleaded , his usual easygoing air morphing into defensiveness .
The topic of these Watergate - like grillings is not sex or lies , but , rather , Wall Street bonuses .
Specifically , the now $ 218 m in awards that the reeling insurance giant AIG , which has already accepted $ 170bn in US taxpayer aid to keep it afloat , with another $ 30bn to come , was recently revealed to have paid out to a few hundred of its employees .
In response , an excitable news media and opportunistic members of Congress spent most of last week in a frenzy of assigning blame and stoking public outrage - never mind that plans to award the bonuses had been known for months .
The outcry even threatened to topple Obama 's treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , until the president heartily defended him on national TV .
Ultimately , the bonus fury is about much more than a gross payday for a crew of undeserving cretins .
In the near - term , it has created a huge and unwelcome distraction for political leaders desperately trying to manage the financial crisis .
In the medium term , it threatens to undermine Obama 's future flexibility to save the US economy .
Above all , it has fuelled a rising populist tide that threatens to swamp Barack Obama 's presidency altogether .
The notion that Obama was cavalier about giving taxpayer dollars to corporate villains is potential political cyanide for a president who , as a candidate last year , was viewed by some working - class voters as an aloof academic .
"" It 's a pretty critical moment , "" says Stan Greenberg , former pollster to Bill Clinton .
"" Voters are trying to make a judgment about Obama and , to some extent , about the new , mostly Democratic political class now in control of the government .
And I think they 're trying to decide , ' Whose side are they on ? '
"" There 's no question that the bonuses are sickening , a moral outrage .
While some of the benefactors may have done little or nothing wrong , many are known to have worked in the specialised London unit whose creative trading gimmickry effectively ruined the company .
Those people are more worthy of jail cells alongside Bernie Madoff , the loathsome Ponzi king , than new vacation homes .
But with the global economy slowly burning down , the current obsession over this lone injustice - just one of countless others that define and explain the current crisis - has become a destructive force of its own .
Not that this should shock anyone .
America has a rich tradition of populism , one that runs from the Great Depression - era ""
Share Our Wealth "" plan of Louisiana Senator Huey Long , to the 1992 and 1996 reform candidacies of Texas billionaire Ross Perot .
And a surge in inequality within US society over the past few years has set the stage for the latest populist explosion .
Under George W Bush , middle - class workers saw their productivity rise , but not their wages .
Meanwhile , healthcare costs soared .
The average American CEO now earns almost 350 times the salary of the average American worker .
At the same time , Americans watched a slew of political scandals unfold in which business lobbyists literally bought off members of Congress and their aides .
Thus , anger towards corporate America and its allies in Congress has increasingly come to shape US politics .
Populism may have been as important a factor as the Iraq war in the 2006 Democratic takeover of Congress , as evidenced by the election of corporate - bashing Democratic senators that year in then - Republican states such as Montana , Ohio and Virginia . ""
Constituents are sending Congress a clear message : it 's torch - and - pitchfork time , "" says a senior Democratic congressional aide , invoking the image of angry mobs storming Washington .
That has members of Congress scrambling for scapegoats .
"" We need perp walks , CEO scalps , trophies to mount on the wall .
The country needs villains to focus its rage on . ""
The problem is that no magic villain exists whose punishment will neatly mollify Americans who are reeling from job losses , foreclosures and a sense that the middle class was essentially ripped off by a modern plutocracy based in Washington and New York .
The inevitable jailing of Bernie Madoff will be just one stitch in a gaping national wound , especially when Madoff 's wife is still enjoying a life in a posh Palm Beach , Florida , home .
That means public anger could be directed at Obama and the Democrats who control Congress .
For now , however , the good news for Democrats is that no strong opposition leader has emerged to harness that public rage .
Republicans have mounted a largely inept assault on the Obama administration , hamstrung by their own corporate ties and , in the case of AIG , the fact that they opposed earlier ( Democratic ) attempts to limit bonuses for corporations getting federal assistance .
The best way for Obama to avoid being consumed by the public 's free - form anger is to put Americans back to work , ensure a rising stock market and , if he can accomplish it , easy access to affordable health care .
But the populist threat itself impedes Obama 's ability to turn the country around .
That 's because such a turnaround will require political capital , a commodity Obama and the Democrats are now haemorrhaging .
Many economists believe , for instance , that a proper recovery will require billions more in taxpayer dollars .
But the AIG fiasco is sure to leave the Congress gun - shy about supporting more assistance to Wall Street .
A pending effort in Congress to impose 90 % tax rates on big bonuses at companies that have taken taxpayer dollars could make things worse .
It threatens to undermine support in the financial world for nationalisation of America 's most dysfunctional banks , a move even the free - market Economist magazine has grudgingly suggested may be necessary .
Opponents of nationalisation , after all , argue that management of government - run banks will be subject to illogical political impulses , just like those on display in dozens of blustery congressional speeches , hearings and press conferences on Capitol Hill last week .
Just how much more latitude the public will afford Obama remains to be seen .
Greenberg has n't yet given up hope .
"" The stakes are high , "" he says .
"" People want Obama to succeed .
They 're just trying to make the judgment about whether he 's going to forget the ordinary people who are struggling and having to pay for this bailout . ""
Those people would do well to remember Obama 's words during his address to Congress in February : "" [ In ] a time of crisis , we can not afford to govern out of anger . ""
Thus far , America 's political system has not responded well to his call .
With time running out on the effort to save the economy , Washington ca n't afford the luxury of more cheap scandal politics .

Michael Crowley is a senior editor at the New Republic magazine"
2009-04-28,"The Obama era in domestic politics has begun .
In the debate over what to do about the economy , the Republicans ' voices have become irrelevant .
They are stuck between defending their past failure to regulate the banks and the Herbert Hoover - like calls of congressman John Boehner of Ohio for less government involvement in the economy .
But as we mark Obama 's first 100 days in office this week , we make a mistake if we focus so intently on the president that we ignore what is going on around him .
Like the Great Depression of the 1930s , today 's Great Recession has changed the way Americans think about themselves .
Some of the changes are matters of style – what Time magazine in its 27 April cover story has labelled "" the new frugality "" .
Americans are buying more generic store brands when they go shopping .
They are postponing or cancelling vacations .
They are buying the cheaper seats at baseball games .
And as the increase in canning and freezing supplies shows , they are eating more at home .
But along with the new frugality are a series of cutbacks that can not be compensated for with extra thrift .
Among people earning less than $ 50,000 a year , 34 % have not gone to the doctor because of the cost , and 31 % have been out of work at one time or another .
Families that once could afford to pay for their children 's college education are seeking scholarships .
Men in families worried about the expense of an unplanned child are getting vasectomies at higher rates .
And once - stable charities are cutting back on their giving .
The New York Times Foundation , which last year made $ 7 m in grants , has announced that it is suspending its grant - making and matching - gift programmes .
The result of these quality - of - life changes is that in a country in which 57 % of those surveyed now think the American dream has become harder to achieve , there has been a dramatic turn to the left .
Two recent studies by Center for American Progress , New Progressive America and the State of American Political Ideology 2009 , show a growing consensus on the need for a series of safety - net measures .
Nearly 80 % of Americans believe that "" government investments in education , infrastructure and science are necessary to ensure America 's long - term economic growth .
"" More than 675 think that "" government has a responsibility to provide financial support for the poor , the sick and the elderly . ""
And 44 % feel that "" the federal government should guarantee affordable health coverage for every American . ""
For the Obama administration , the great test in the coming year will be how well it can implement programmes that build on such thinking .
On a small scale it is already possible to see the extent to which the every - man - for - himself values of the Bush administration have been overcome with actions taken by state and private institutions dealing with the environment and education .
In California and a half - dozen other states , cities have begun making new energy - saving measures affordable .
They have helped families install solar panels on their homes by granting them municipal loans that they then repay over time on their property taxes .
At the same time across the country colleges and universities have followed exactly the opposite course from the banks : they have put the interests of those they serve ahead of themselves .
At Harvard , as well as at less well - off schools ( most of which have seen the value of their endowments drop 20 - 30 % )
salaries have been frozen and building programmes have been cut back , but scholarship aid has been increased .
The nation 's colleges and universities have acted on the belief that students should not have to wait for the recession to end in order to continue their educations .
The message these small - scale successes send is that burden - sharing and a new egalitarianism are the keys to the future .
The message is one that Obama embraced in his inaugural address when he declared : "" The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross economic product , but on the reach of our prosperity , on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart . ""
The catch is that for Obama to make good on his inaugural address , he will have to draw more Republican support than he has so far .
The change in thinking that the recession has brought about is not a magic bullet right now .
The huge congressional Democratic majorities that Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed in the 1930s and Lyndon Johnson had in the 1960s are not Obama 's , and today 's Republican party gives every indication that it may prefer to play the spoiler role until 2010 on the belief that if Obama can be kept from governing effectively , Republicans in the House and Senate will be rewarded by voters ."
2009-07-01,"Those searching for clues about Tiger Woods ' thoughts on the world beyond the golf course will be interested to note that as the host of the AT&amp;T National event he has chosen the Republican minority leader of the House John Boehner as one of his partners in today 's pro - am at Congressional Country Club .
The Washington Times has the details .
Boehner is a seven - handicapper and was ranked 36th in Golf Digest 's Top 200 Washington political golf rankings .
( No , I did n't know such a thing existed either . )
What Digest failed to note is that Boehner is an old ally of the scarily right - wing Newt Gingrich and is a pro - business , anti - government "" flat earther "" who has had ties to the tobacco industry , oil companies and military contractors through the years .
As recently as last week , Tiger 's new golfing buddy had this to say about the Climate Change Bill as it passed through congress : "" Hey , people deserve to know what 's in this pile of shit . ""
Hey , at least Boehner and Tiger have a pretty similar vocabulary .
Presumably , Woods ' first choice as partner was Barack Obama and presumably the President had other things on his mind .
But why did n't the world no1 then ask the American no2 , vice - president Joe Biden ?
After all , Biden plays golf and has plenty of time on his hands ."
2009-10-08,"House minority leader John Boehner has accused President Barack Obama of endangering the mission in Afghanistan by "" delaying action "" on sending more troops .
But present policy would require more troops than America could ever send – as many as 650,000 troops for the next 12 to 14 years , according to the US army and marine corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual metrics .
This commitment of time and resources can not be accomplished at a cost acceptable to Americans .
Many critics of the war , including Boehner , are not asking the right question when it comes to the eight - year campaign in Afghanistan : not whether the war is winnable , but whether the mission constitutes a vital national security interest .
From that perspective the current open - ended strategy fails .
In his battlefield assessment of the war , General Stanley McChrystal , America 's top commander in Afghanistan , says without more troops the mission "" will likely result in failure "" .
But success in Afghanistan would hardly be guaranteed even if Obama were to commit several hundred thousand troops and decades of armed nation - building .
It is well past time for the US to adapt means and ends .
Rather than an indefinite military mission with large numbers of US troops , US strategy should focus on assisting and training Afghan forces in order to limit that country 's future dependence on foreign troops for security .
Growing and improving the effectiveness of the Afghan national security forces ( ANSF ) is limited and feasible .
A focused mission of training the ANSF means America must support , rather than supplant , indigenous security efforts .
In March , Obama committed 4,000 US trainers to Afghanistan , while Nato pledged an additional 5,000 military trainers and police .
At that time , the Afghan national army ( ANA ) had about 82,000 soldiers , a number scheduled to grow to 134,000 by the end of 2011 .
The Afghan national police ( ANP ) stands between 85,000 and 90,000 .
It currently covers 365 districts , 46 city police precincts and has a presence in all 34 provinces .
But numbers tell only part of the story .
The focused district development programme ( FDD ) is a district - by - district training regimen for police units .
The FDD is directed by the combined security transition command Afghanistan , a joint service organisation under the command and control of US central command that is responsible for equipping and training Afghan security forces .
Since it began in October 2007 , a mere 52 of 365 police districts have successfully completed the programme , despite training camps operating at maximum capacity .
The concept of proper police procedures and respect for the rights of citizens remains underdeveloped .
"" The first time they heard that they were n't supposed to beat people , and they were n't supposed to take their money , [ but ] that they were supposed to enforce laws and that their job was to protect the people , most police were surprised , "" said army Colonel Michael McMahon , the FDD 's director .
According to Karen Hall , police programme manager in the bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs at the US department of state , 75 % of the Afghan national police are illiterate , which prevents many officers from filling out arrest reports , equipment and supply requests and arguing before a judge or prosecutor .
Going forward , training should be tied to clear metrics , such as whether Afghans can operate independent of coalition forces and can take the lead in operations against insurgents .
As the war in Afghanistan rages on , Obama should be sceptical of any suggestions that the defeat of al - Qaida depends upon a massive troop presence .
Committing still more US personnel to Afghanistan undermines the already weak authority of Afghan leaders , interferes with the ability to deal with other security challenges and pulls the US deeper into a bloody and protracted guerilla war with no end in sight ."

Here 's a mash - up of the will.i.am
Yes We Can video from the halcyon days of the 2008 election â€ “ spliced with clips of Republican minority leader John Boehner losing it on Sunday night and bellowing "" Hell
no ! """
2010-07-01,"In his comments that have attracted wide attention because he said financial reform regulation was like taking a nuclear weapon to an ant , Republican House minority leader John Boehner also noted that today 's Democrats "" are snuffing out the America that I grew up in . ""
Boehner was born in November 1949 .
Let 's take a look at the America he grew up in .
In the America John Boehner grew up in , the top marginal tax rate on wealthy earners was 90 % .
It had gone up there during the war , and five , 10 , 15 years after armistice , no sizable group , Democrat or Republican , felt any strong urge to lower it .
In the America John Boehner grew up in , private - sector union membership was around or above 30 % .
Today 's figure is 7 % .
The right to form a union was broadly accepted .
Outside of a few small turbulent pockets , there was no such thing as today 's union - busting law firms hired by management to go into workplaces and intimidate workers .
In the America John Boehner grew up in , the country had a president - a Republican president - who believed the following : Should any political party attempt to abolish social security , unemployment insurance , and eliminate labor laws and farm programs , you would not hear of that party again in our political history .
There is a tiny splinter group , of course , that believes that you can do these things .
Among them are a few Texas oil millionaires , and an occasional politician or businessman from other areas .
Their number is negligible and they are stupid .
Interesting , that mention of unemployment insurance , the week after a "" majority "" of 40 Republicans in the Senate ( plus one Democrat ) managed to block the will of 57 Democrats and cut off such benefits for 1.2 million Americans .
In the America John Boehner grew up in , when little Johnny was just starting school in fact , the federal government undertook the largest public works project in the country 's history , the interstate highway system .
It cost $ 100 billion dollars , a little more .
The feds picked up 90 % of the tab , and it was paid largely through dedicated taxes .
In the America John Boehner grew up in , the Republican Party was a moderate - to - conservative party .
The modern conservative movement was just coming to life - in Bill Buckley 's offices in Manhattan , on the campus of Notre Dame University , in Orange County , California .
But many establishment Republicans considered these people a bunch of dangerous kooks .
Obviously these points do n't represent the sum and substance of the 1950s , and there were ways in which the period was more conservative than ours .
But if Boehner really wants to go back : fine , let 's start negotiations ."
2010-07-15,"So it looks like finreg reform is passing today , since it has cleared the cloture vote by 60 - 38 .
Snowe and Collins of Maine , and erstwhile wingnut hero Scott Brown , voted with the Democrats .
Immediately John Boehner said you know , we 'd like to repeal that one too : "" I think it ought to be repealed , "" said House Minority Leader John Boehner , in response to a question from TPMDC , at his weekly press conference this morning .
One of his top lieutenants , Republican Conference Chair Mike Pence agrees .
"" We hope [ the Senate vote ] falters so we can start over , "" Pence told TPMDC yesterday .
"" I think the reason you 're not hearing talk about efforts to repeal the permanent bailout authority is because the bill has n't passed yet .
"" I 'm not sure we 'll see a serious effort along these lines .
Finreg reform is a lot more popular than healthcare reform was .
Mitch McConnell probably could have found a way to block finreg in the Senate if he 'd really wanted to ; remember that the tea party movement seems to have taken over the Maine Republican Party , so Snowe and/or Collins could have pressured to vote no if McConnell had really wanted that .
Even so , in this little set piece , we 're seeing a preview of the midterm election argument .
The Democrats are basically going to say , we 're trying to do things to get the economy moving and to help working Americans , but the Republicans block everything .
The Republicans are going to say yes , you 're damn right we block everything , and thank God we do , because it 's all Marxism .
So in an odd way both sides agree - at least on the premise .
From there it 's a question of selling the argument .
The Republicans frankly have the easier case to make , because the Democrats have to explain these complicated bills that have n't really had any effect yet .
But maybe at least with this one , the Democrats can say we stood with you and reigned in Wall Street ( which is half true , but that 's true enough ) and Republicans stood with Wall Street .
Here too the GOP counterargument is clever because they say they voted against more bailout authority .
But while that argument revs up their base , I still think the Democratic argument can win with the swing voter .
Anyway , that 's your election .
Obstructionism good or bad , discuss ."
2010-09-13,"So Congress reconvenes today , and the Bush tax - cut question is on the top of the list .
It certainly looks like House Republican leader John Boehner blinked yesterday when he said : If the only option I have is to vote for those at [ $ 250,000 ] and below , of course I 'm going to do that .
But I 'm going to do everything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans .
This surprised pretty much everybody , and apparently Robert Gibbs made the rounds of the morning shows just now trumpeting this as a key Democratic p.r .
victory .
It 's certainly an uncharacteristic folding of cards on the early side .
On the other hand , Boehner can speak like this in the full knowledge that a package of cuts only for those households below $ 250,000 is never going to clear the ( oh , this again )
Senate .
From today 's Washington Post : McConnell said Democrats have zero chance of passing Obama 's plan in the Senate .
He said not a single Republican would support it , leaving Democrats short of the 60 votes needed to cut off a filibuster . ""
That 's a debate we 're happy to have .
That 's the kind of debate that unifies my caucus , from Olympia Snowe to Jim DeMint , "" McConnell said , citing the most liberal and most conservative Republicans in the Senate .
Assuming this is and remains true , then it does n't really matter what Boehner says .
He can play good cop all he wants , right ?
In fact , it makes the Republicans look good and reasonable : Hey , some of us were willing to back the president 's plan .
The problem was in the Senate , where the opposition came not just from Republicans .
So do n't look at us .
This is even somewhat - to - mostly true , alas , because of the six Senate Democrats who want the tax cut to extend to all households .
I do n't know where these six Democrats stand on the question of whether they 'd support a below-250-only bill if that were the only vote placed before them .
If they would not , then Obama 's proposal is truly dead .
If they would , then it has a chance if they can get one Republican to change .
How would that happen ?
It 's a heavy lift .
The only argument is that the GOP position of extensions for all increases the deficit by another $ 700 billion .
So Obama would need to drive that home in the next seven weeks .
That would n't thrill the liberals , but it 's the only way to have a chance of winning the argument : Republicans want deficit reduction until it comes to the top 2 % .
And if that does n't work , then Obama might well be forced into a position where he has to sign an across - the - board extension .
That can maybe be put off until after the election , but if it happens it will still be embarrassing .
And let 's remember : if the Senate operated according to majority rule , none of this would be happening .
There are easily 54 votes in the Senate for Obama 's proposal , and if every Blue Dog in the House knew the Senate would pass it , enough of them would be going along so that this constituted "" the Democratic position "" and the vast majority of them would be going out and fighting to defend it .
But Senate rules and only Senate rules make it impossible for a policy backed by 54 % of senators and about the same percentage of House members , and the White House , to become law .
By the way , here is my New York Review of Books piece on the filibuster .
Here 's a little taste :
[ S]ome founders — George Mason of Virginia among them — backed supermajority requirements , but many were suspicious of them .
The Continental Congress , under the Articles of Confederation , had been run on the supermajority principle — most legislation needed the support of two thirds of the states , or nine out of thirteen , to pass — and the results were unsatisfying .
James Madison acknowledged that "" more than a majority "" might be justifiable in limited instances but argued that requirements for a supermajority were open to a decisive objection :
In all cases where justice or the general good might require new laws to be passed , or active measures to be pursued , the fundamental principle of free government would be reversed .
It would be no longer the majority that would rule ; the power would be transferred to the minority .
Well put , Jim ."
2010-09-14,"I 'm sensing from reading around that Republicans may be a little worried that Obama is making sure the American people know who John Boehner is .
I sense this because they 're sniffing at it and calling it unpresidential .
Here 's Fred Barnes : A word comes to mind about the Boehner gambitâ€”unpresidential .
Karl Rove , President Bush 's political adviser , offered four wordsâ€”""nutty , demeaning , useless , ill - conceived . ""
So far as I know , a premeditated assault by a president on the leader of the opposition ( minority ) party in the House is unprecedented .
Would Ronald Reagan , Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton , or any other president even have considered such a tactic ?
I suspect not .
And here 's Rich Lowry :
The Democratic firm Public Policy Polling recently found that 42 percent of voters in Boehner 's home state of Ohio have no opinion of him .
According to a Fox News poll earlier this year , 55 percent of people nationally had never heard of him .
The White House figures people will hate Boehner with an unbridled passion â€
” if only they could remember his name .
This is the very definition of sliding - off - a - cliff , grasping - at - saplings desperation .
Obama traveled to Cleveland last week to give a speech responding to an economic address by Boehner there a couple of weeks prior .
Boehner 's speech had mostly been ignored by the press at the time , since it had n't occurred to anyone that he was the pivot upon which the future of the nation would turn .
Actually , you can count me as shocked to the point of complete disbelief that 45 % of Americans have heard of Boehner .
I think that 's all but impossible to be true .
Even so , I do n't see why this is such a bad idea .
I think that when presidents say things , people listen .
About 70 to 75 % of the country does not hate Barack Obama .
And he is the president .
People just listen to the president .
You 're trained to do so from the time you 're sentient .
That does n't mean people hang on every word and think he walks on water .
It just means that they listen .
I seem to recall back in 2002 that Dubya went out and did an unprecedented amount of campaigning against Democrats in Senate and House races .
I guess it may be true that Bush did n't single out any particular Democrat as his nemesis , but he did far more campaigning than sitting presidents usually do , and there was speculation that he was risking a lot of political capital .
But it worked ( of course , that was partly because the Democrats were so afraid
post 9 - 11 to do anything oppositional of relevance ) .
I suspect that maybe Barnes and Lowry and others understand that Boehner is a uniquely unappealing and oleaginous human being ( watch this ) and that most Americans who become aware of him will be to some degree repulsed by what they see .
As for what 's presidential and what is n't , it 's my view that what 's not presidential is doing nothing while your party loses control of the House , setting your good self up to be impeached by a bunch of extremists ."
2010-09-30,"Yglesias , citing the FT 's Ed Luce on the Pledge for America .
These two grafs are Luce 's :
In contrast , John Boehner , the Republican leader in the House of Representatives , flanked by the "" Young Guns "" , only one of whom is younger than Mr Cameron , promised to maintain all the tax cuts that George W. Bush instituted , never raise any taxes again in any shape or form , and do all this while restoring America 's budget to balance .
All of which might have been plausible were it to have spelt out the draconian spending cuts that would therefore be necessary to bring the budget back to surplus .
But it declined to do so .
Instead it ring - fenced more than three - quarters of the US federal budget – social security , Medicare and defence spending – and promised to impose caps on the remaining , "" discretionary "" portion of it .
And Yglesias : The only question at this point is why this comes as a surprise to anyone .
Since 1980 , we 've had two movement conservative presidents and this is what they both did — cut taxes drastically , increased military spending , reduced spending on a few things , blew up the deficit , and relaxed regulatory enforcement .
Both George HW Bush and Bill Clinton reduced the deficit with a mix of higher taxes and lower spending , and both were denounced by the right for doing so .
But deficit reduction is n't a mystery .
You need higher taxes and lower spending .
Should n't this be easy for the Democrats ?
Ladies and gentlemen , for all they talk about deficits , look at the last two conservative presidents , two of the most conservative presidents we 've ever had .
Both cut taxes and exploded the deficit .
So that pretty much proves you ca n't do both .
So Boehner is talking nonsense and he knows it , and when push comes to shove , what he and his buddies really want to cut taxes on the rich .
It would be a cleaner argument if , as I said this morning , the Democrats defined "" rich "" more accurately , as starting at $ 300,000 but really kicking in at something quite above that .
I 'm headed out of town for a day for a meeting .
This means , alas , no quiz tomorrow morning , and probably no posting tomorrow , as I will be in aforementioned meeting .
But I may throw down a couple of bonus posts over the weekend .
In the meantime , why do n't some of you use the occasion of this thread to give your fellow commenters some mini - quizzes of your own ?
Hegelian can do German philosophers , Bookfan can do Dutch history , and Vicious Misanthrope can test your knowledge of points of commonality between the oeuvres of Michael Mann and Lucien Goldman .
Good times ."
2010-10-28,"This one takes cojones .
I do not say that admirably , as one sometimes does .
John Boehner , evidently the soon - to - be - speaker of the people 's house , is spending some time on the precious final weekend of campaigning to appear with the GOP candidate for the House of Representatives who has been busted this cycle for his past as an Einzatsgrupen soldier in the Third Rech .
From TPM , quoting the web site of said candidate , Rich Iott : RALLY WITH LEADER BOEHNER Oct 30 , 2010
When : Saturday , October 30th 8:30 am - 9:00 am Where
: Lucas County GOP Victory Center , 10 S. Superior St , Toledo Calling all Iott Volunteers !
Please join us for this very special pre - election rally with House Minority Leader , John Boehner .
What a great way to start off our pre - election weekend .
Please wear any Iott gear you may have !
Should you have any further questions , please do n't hesitate to call 419.324.[xxxx ]
Josh Green of the Atlantic , not quite believing this could be right , contacted Boehner 's people .
And : In a statement to The Atlantic , Don Seymour from Boehner 's staff says it 's about the volunteers : "" Leader Boehner will be rallying Republican volunteers at the Lucas County Victory Center to support the local Republican Party 's get - out - the - vote efforts .
Boehner has been on the road headlining rallies for Republican candidates in Ohio and across the country , and he 'll continue his busy campaign schedule into the final weekend before Tuesday 's referendum on Democrats ' jobs - killing policies .
"" The thing is , Iott stands only the very slimmest chance of winning , so why bother ?
And I thought Obama 's scheduler was prone to error .
No .
Wait .
The thing of it is not that Iott wo n't win .
The thing of it is that he dressed up in a Nazi uniform .
And defended it .
And now , the congressional leader of the Republican Party is going to appear with him .
And it 's supposed to be a major outrage if someone on my side calls these people fascists , right ?
I give up ."
2010-11-03,"John Boehner learned his craft in a bar .
The years keeping the belligerent and unreasonable from coming to blows as he served drinks at his father 's tavern may yet prove invaluable experience for the new Republican leader in the lower house of the US Congress in dealing with what promises to be a particularly fractious intake of new members .
Still , crying on camera over his joy at the Republican landslide in the House of Representatives will not have done much to enhance his authority .
Boehner , who is about to become the third most powerful person in the country , promotes himself as a working class guy who grew up as one of 12 children in Cincinnati .
But he made his name in the Republican party as an effective fundraiser through close ties to big corporate interests that shaped Boehner 's agenda of cutting taxes and minimising government regulation as well as his opposition to social legislation such as healthcare reform .
Boehner ran a plastics company before entering politics , with the backing of an Ohio steel company in the 1980s that has remained the largest corporate donor to his campaign fund .
He earned the respect of many of his colleagues in the House of Representatives as an uncompromising supporter of blocking co - operation with the Democrats , and rose rapidly .
But in 1999 , the party leadership effectively sacked him from a top party post in the House .
Four years ago , he made a comeback , to be elected the second - most powerful Republican in the lower chamber , and then swiftly to the top post after the Democrats won control .
Boehner 's fall and comeback have helped him position himself as an ally of the Tea Party by claiming to be a radical and an outsider .
Barack Obama has called him the face of obstructionism in Congress .
Boehner has promised to fight to reverse the president 's legislation , including healthcare reform and financial industry regulation .
The Washington Post described how his first phone call , on the Republicans winning control of the House , was to Tea Party activists in his Ohio constituency .
"" I 'll never let you down , "" Boehner said .
But now he faces the challenge of not letting down people who believe they have sent their elected representatives to Washington to slash and burn government programmes while retaining the support of Republicans who fear that such aggressive tactics will backfire on the party and strengthen Obama .
Boehner will be needing those skills he learned in his father 's tavern ."
2010-11-03,"â˜ …
Whatever the true significance of this week 's vote , let nobody base their assessment on the much - reported fact that it moved John Boehner , the ascendant Republican house leader , to tears .
The Ohio congressman may be most famous for his bright orange tan â€ “ "" We have a lot in common : he is a person of colour , although not a colour that appears in the natural world , "" Barack Obama said in a speech last year
â€ “
but he 's almost as renowned for turning on the waterworks at a whim .
Boehner "" will cry at a supermarket opening "" , the news host Keith Olbermann pointed out .
No matter what the topic â€ “ his objections to US foreign policy , the small print of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , the unveiling of a statue in honour of Ronald Reagan â€ “
he usually manages to squeeze out a few helpful droplets .
Expect more of the same in the coming months , then â€ “ especially now the pressure 's on him to produce a credible alternative to Obama 's communist masterplan.""I did come up with one , but it made me cry , and the tears made the ink run "" just is n't going to cut it as an excuse .
â˜
…
On his Kilroy - Silkesque hue , by the way , Boehner is on record as saying : "" I have never been in a tanning bed or used a tanning product . ""
Do n't laugh with incredulity , or his upper lip may start trembling .
â˜
…
There has been a muted response so far to the defeat in California of Proposition 19 , which would have legalised private possession of limited quantities of marijuana .
Prediction : the levels of vocal dismay will increase as hundreds of West Coast stoners amble up to their polling places over the coming days to try to vote for it .
â˜
… Penetrating insight from commentator Andrew Klavan in the Los Angeles Times , who argues â€ “ without apparent irony
â€ “ that the box - office success of Toy Story 3 ought to have warned Democrats they were in for a drubbing .
Consider the movie 's narrative , in which fiercely independent souls Woody and Buzz Lightyear are donated "" to a daycare centre deceptively named Sunnyside "" where they meet "" the modern American paradigms : Lots - o'-Huggin ' Bear , Big Baby and the shallow , metrosexual Ken doll ( pictured ) "" , which is exactly the same as Obama 's nanny - state agenda . ""
Let 's hope this Toy Story 3 election is the beginning of an escape from the smothering notion that we are helpless victims who need to live in a daycare state that supplies our every need , "" Klavan writes .
Possibly not the most obvious sense in which American politics has come to resemble a child 's toybox , but an impressive effort nonetheless .
â˜
…
The biggest unanswered question of the election
, I 'm sure you 'll agree , was : "" Is Senator Harry Reid a vampire or a dead man brought back to life ? ""
So thank goodness John Kerry is on hand to provide clarification . ""
Politico was wrong , Huffington Post was wrong , hell , all the pundits were wrong , "" Kerry said , celebrating Reid 's survival in Nevada . ""
Harry Reid is n't just Dracula , he is n't just Lazarus , he 's our leader , and our whole caucus is thrilled that he 's unbreakable and unbeatable . ""
Harry Reid , a vampire raised from the dead by Jesus .
And that 's just in the opinion of his friends ."
2010-11-03,"John Boehner , the Republican in line to become the third most powerful person in the US after the sweeping Republican gains in the midterm elections , likes to portray himself as a man of the people .
The 60-year - old reminded supporters at a victory party that he "" started out mopping floors , waiting tables and tending bar at my dad 's tavern "" .
But this is also someone who is a darling of powerful corporate interests .
Wall Street and the tobacco industry contribute heavily to Boehner .
"" The Street is starved for someone with real - life experience in Washington and John Boehner fits it to the T , "" Chris Krueger of Capital Concept , a private firm that tracks Washington for institutional investors , told Reuters .
According to the Centre for Public Integrity in Washington , Boehner , who is second in line for the presidency behind Joe Biden , took more than $ 1.5 m ( Â£930,000 ) in political action committee contributions in two decades from companies such as AT&amp;T , the telecommunications giant , Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase , the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the tobacco giants Reynolds America and Altria .
He earned their support by voting with the US Chamber of Commerce 93 % of the time over his career .
The AFL - CIO , the umbrella organisation for unions , said Boehner voted against their interests in every vote he cast in 2008 and 2009 .
His close ties with lobbyists have occasionally raised eyebrows among his fellow Republicans .
Chris Shays , of Connecticut , a former House Republican who opposed Boehner 's leadership bid in 2006 , noted at the time : ""
The problem John faces is that he 's so close to K Street , "" a reference to the Washington area favoured by lobbyists .
Long before Boehner rose to his current position as House Republican leader , he created the "" Thursday group "" â€ “ a weekly discussion around a conference - room table on Capitol Hill with conservative and business lobbyists , including representatives of the US Chamber of Commerce and other influential trade associations .
Despite his close ties to corporate interests , Boehner also has to keep on side the Tea Party movement , which loathes big banks and big government in almost equal measure .
According to the Washington Post , Boehner made his first congratulatory call to the Tea Party .
In a televised call from a hotel suite in Washington to Tea Party activists in his south - western Ohio district , he said : "" I 'll never let you down . ""
How he squares the circle between his anti - big business supporters and powerful corporate interests will be interesting to watch , but there is no doubting Boehner 's political skills â€ “ and his formidable capacity as a fundraiser .
He quickly climbed the leadership ladder after joining the House .
He suffered a setback during a 1998 power struggle when he was removed from a post in the House leadership , but bounced back and started moving up again .
Boehner has been singled out by Barack Obama in campaign speeches as the face of Republican obstructionism .
He got members of his party to stick together against Obama measures that were rammed through the Democratic - led House in the past two years , including the healthcare overhaul and an $ 814bn economic stimulus plan .
One hundred days into Obama 's administration , Boehner said the Democratic legislative agenda made him "" want to throw up "" and his "" hell no "" speech during the first healthcare debate became a YouTube sensation .
Boehner has said he plans to do everything he can
â€ “
"" I mean everything "" â€ “ to repeal Obama 's healthcare reform , a top Tea Party target ."
2010-11-04,"You 'd think that John Boehner would have seen enough drunks blubbering into their drinks at his dad 's tavern to be wary of easy tears .
You know , that humble boyhood tavern in Ohio Boehner is always talking about , where he mopped floors and waited tables , until he eventually worked his way up to becoming the third most powerful man in America after Tuesday 's epic Republican midterms victory .
Whereupon Boehner , telling a story he must have told hundreds of times in his career , choked up in tears recalling his own accomplishments .
Politicians do cry in public .
The Bushes , father and son , have been known to shed a tear .
Bill Clinton wells up .
Barack Obama cried at a rally on the eve of the 2008 elections , when he learned the grandmother who had raised him had just died of cancer .
I might be less offended if Boehner had been crying about a 9.6 % unemployment rate , or the tens of thousands of people who lost their homes at the stroke of an auto - signature pen in the wrongful foreclosure scandal .
But there is something unsavoury about seeing a well - off , white , middle - aged male overcome when the subject moving them to tears is their personal career track .
Rahm Emanuel , a man notorious for once sending a dead fish to a political enemy and shreaking obscenities at co - workers , plumbed the same teary depths at his White House leaving ceremony last month , when he choked up at mention of his family 's sacrifices .
But Boehner is tearier than most when the cameras are on .
He has cried accepting awards , at an unveiling of a statue of Ronald Reagan , and at a rousing chorus of America the Beautiful .
Is it genuine ?
That 's between Boehner and his handkerchief .
But it 's interesting to note that when Hillary Clinton teared up towards the end of a long and gruelling campaign for the New Hampshire primary in early 2008 , conservative columnists accused her of faking it to win votes .
And , though it 's entirely unsurprising , there were no tears from Nancy Pelosi , who just lost her job as speaker on election day .
Women politicians are still not permitted to cry in public , lest they be accused of being too soft for the job .
So , John , man up !"
2010-11-07,"John Boehner , who is set to be the new Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , is one of the most lobby - friendly politicians in Washington , located at the centre of a web of corporate cash and influence .
The heavily tanned , golf - playing Republican congressman from Ohio will become one of the most powerful politicians in Washington when he replaces the defeated liberal icon , Nancy Pelosi .
The Republicans ' huge victory in last week 's midterm elections has effectively crowned him as the most senior Republican in office .
He will spearhead the rightwing fight against Barack Obama and attempt to reverse many of the Democrats ' legislative achievements of the past two years , including trying to repeal healthcare reform .
But Democrats and liberal campaigning groups are hoping that the huge network of wealth and lobbyist influence around Boehner might be the chink in his armour .
They point to his long history of consorting closely with wealthy , fast - living lobbyists which they say suggests he is distinctly out of touch with an American public still suffering from the impact of the Great Recession .
"" It will become a tough issue for him .
If the focus of the public goes on him and all the lobbyists around him , it could get very difficult , "" said Professor Bruce Gronbeck , a political scientist at the University of Iowa and a specialist in the politics of scandal .
There is certainly a lot for Democrats and Boehner 's other political enemies to work with .
His reputation in Washington circlesis almost that of a Hollywood movie sterotype of the as a glad - handing politician with close ties to the capital 's lobbyists akin to a Hollywood movie sterotype .
Several nicknames seem to sum up his style .
The first is GTL , standing for "" golf , tan and lobbyists "" .
The second is Boehnerland , a term used to describe the enormous network of powerful influence peddlers close to him who have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns and have taken him on dozens of corporate - funded private trips around the country .
Boehner makes no secret of his lobbyist links .
He once organised a regular meeting of politicians and lobbyists called the Thursday Group â€ “ now disbanded â€ “ at which both sides discussed a shared agenda of reducing taxes and regulations on business .
His close circle of lobbyist allies consists of some of the best known names in Washington power - broking circles .
One important figure is Bruce Gates , the top individual donor during Boehner 's career giving more than $ 70,000 to his campaigns .
Gates 's wife , Joyce , spent two years as Boehner 's chief of staff and Gates himself has served as treasurer for one of Boehner 's fund - raising vehicles , the Freedom Project .
He has a long list of big business clients including steel companies and is now in charge of government relations for the huge tobacco firm Altria , the parent group of Philip Morris .
Another senior lobbyist with close ties to Boehner is Henry Gandy who has lobbied for healthcare firms and financial giants such as Goldman Sachs .
Other financial firms , such as Bank of America , have been represented by Marc Lampkin , once Boehner 's general counsel and now a lobbyist .
Lampkin , like several other former Boehner staffers , has enjoyed the fruits of the "" revolving door "" between working for politicians and then working for lobbying firms .
He continues to enjoy a close relationship with Boehner .
The list goes on , including Sam Baptista who plays golf with Boehner and is a lobbyist representing Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial . ""
Many politicians have received significant money from lobbyists , but John Boehner does receive a lot of support from this industry , "" said Dave Levinthal , a director at the Centre for Responsive Politics , which monitors lobbyist cash flows in Washington .
"" There is no indication that he is going to change his mode of operation . ""
Of course , every politician in Washington has links to lobbyists representing anything from banks to unions .
But the scale and closeness of Boehner 's links has raised many eyebrows .
Critics point to an infamous incident in 1995 when Boehner handed out cheques from the tobacco industry to politicians on the floor of Congress .
He later apologised .
Watchdogs and Democrats point out that Boehner has a long record of resisting efforts to reform the lobbyist influence in Washington and has supported the agenda of big businesses .
They point out that Boehner voted on measures that benefited health insurance companies and has taken large amounts of cash from the health insurance industry .
He was one of only 19 congressman to vote to protect an anti - trust exemption that helped out the insurance industry , which has given him many thousands of dollars .
He has attacked regulation on steel companies at the same time as he takes money from them .
He has lobbied the Environmental Protection Agency to drop a lawsuit against a steel company that supports him .
While there is no proof of a direct link between donations to Boehner and specific actions , anti - lobbyist groups protest that the huge donations to politicians are not simply good will and philanthropy .
One way or another , they want something back . ""
A lobbyist 's goal is to exact a result for a client and they are paid handsomely to do so , "" said Levinthal .
Boehner and his allies dismiss such criticism as Democratic anger over their recent political defeats .
They say Boehner 's actions are nothing to do with lobbyist cash and everything to do with a genuine political commitment to promoting business growth and his conservative pro - free market principles .
But anti - lobbying groups point to the huge flows of cash now flooding into the US electoral system â€ “ often via lobbyists â€ “ in the wake of a recent supreme court decision that scrapped many campaign finance reform restrictions .
Levinthal said that in the wake of that decision last week 's midterm elections had been among the most lavishly funded in US history .
He said people were concerned that the sheer power of lobbyist donations could overwhelm the influence of ordinary voters .
"" We see that lobbyists as an industry are paid $ 3.5bn a year to influence lawmakers .
They will have a greater opportunity to get their narrow special interests across than average Americans , "" he said ."
2010-11-30,"So Obama meets today with Mitch McConnell , John Boehner and other Republicans , as well as Democratic leaders , in a 60- or 90-minute session , to talk about the tax cuts , the START treaty and other new business .
One does not see much coming out of this .
START seems dead for now .
And the R 's are n't going to blink on the tax cuts .
They seem completely prepared to let taxes on all income levels go up and try to pin it on the Democrats , comfortable in the knowledge that , if taxes go up , your average person will figure that it was the Democrats what did it .
They are probably right about that , alas .
One also wonders what the White House thinks it 's getting out of Obama 's announcement yesterday about a pay freeze for federal workers .
I can see the political rationale , provided they get something out of it in return .
But what are they getting ?
Starting tomorrow , unemployment benefits for 2 million more jobless Americans are going to begin to expire , meaning that these benefits will end during the holiday season .
Republicans are opposed to extending them because , of course , doing so would increase the deficit .
Yes , extending Bush tax cuts to higher - income brackets would do that , too , on a far grander scale , and it 's up to Obama and the Democrats to drive that point home and make sure the voters know about it .
If the Democrats could somehow link the pay freeze to jobless benefits extension , then that would maybe be worth it politically .
People care a lot more about jobs right now than the deficit .
But the Republicans wo n't negotiate , even though Obama here has adopted one of their positions .
From the Politico story linked to above : And Obama 's attempt to find common ground ahead of the meeting — his last - minute embrace of a two - year wage freeze for federal workers — was met with skepticism by some Republicans , who are irked by Obama 's failure to credit them for the proposal during his brief remarks Monday . ""
This was a pretty obvious missed opportunity , "" said a GOP leadership aide .
"" If you 're going to embrace a proposal that Republicans have made in the past , why not say so ?
Why try to hog all the credit ?
Communication is like bacon — it makes everything better .
But this was just ham - fisted .
"" I see .
So the substantive point does n't matter because he failed to give the poor babies credit .
Boo hoo .
What a bunch of silly , unserious people .
That America is confused enough to think these people deserved more seats in Congress is testament to just how weak the Democrats are ."
2010-12-13,"Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes did one of those "" getting to you know "" profiles of incoming House speaker John Boehner last night .
What 's interesting , to the limited extent that John Boehner is interesting , is the public persona he seems to be developing .
Most Republicans want to be tough guys .
Reagan , "" Read My Lips "" Bush Sr . , Gingrich , "" Bring it on "" Bush Jr ...
that 's what they understand .
Boehner , by contrast , is more of a wounded puppy type : John Boehner thinks President Barack Obama is "" engaging "" and "" smart "" â€ ” but the speaker - elect is also still smarting over the president 's claim that he took taxpayers hostage to secure a tax break for the rich .
In an interview with Leslie Stahl of "" 60 Minutes "" for broadcast Sunday night on CBS , Boehner said Obama showed him "" disrespect "" by calling him a hostage - taker .
Is n't it usually liberals and Democrats who whine about respect ?
And then , of course , Boehner cried again last night , just as he did on election night , when discussing the American dream .
No reason to doubt the sincerity , I suppose , but I wonder how often a Republican man wants to tear up in public .
Oh well , we could hardly ask for two better representatives of the different Americas .
Obama grew up in an educated household , with a PhD mother and grandparents who made sure he read books and went to a posh school .
Boehner grew up the poor son of a barkeep who fathered 12 kids .
Obama became a community organizer , Boehner a small businessman , working in plastics sales .
Obama was a city guy , Boehner a small - towner ( although his small town is actually a suburb of Cincinnati , which is a big city but one of America 's most conservative ) .
Boehner 's substantive job is on one level the same substantive job every president - elect has : do n't overreach , do n't interpret the vote as some mandate for your own greatness .
Virtually every president - elect makes this mistake .
Newt Gingrich made this mistake in 1995 when he was in Boehner 's shoes .
I do n't think Nancy Pelosi made it in 2007 when she took over , but probably only because , given the size of her Blue Dog caucus , she did n't have the votes to remake America in the style she hoped for .
As large chunks of the GOP base have veered off to some other planet ideologically , and considering that maybe 40 of the new GOP House members are pretty far out there themselves , Boehner has his work cut out for him .
The debt ceiling vote , coming in probably March , will be the first big test of whether he can corral votes for responsible legislation or let himself be overrun by conspiracy theorists ."
2011-01-05,"The Republican John Boehner was elected the new Speaker of the House today , marking a shift to the right in Washington as he replaced the first woman in the post , the Democrat Nancy Pelosi .
The meeting of the 112th Congress , with the Republicans in control of the House and having slashed the Democratic majority in the Senate , is a long way from the heady days of 2007 when Pelosi was elected Speaker and the Democrats held both the House and the Senate .
With control of the House , the Republicans have a substantial platform from which to harry Barack Obama in the White House .
The Republicans hold 242 of the 435 House seats and the Democrats 193 after the November elections , a gain of 63 .
There are 87 new Republicans and nine Democrats .
Boehner , in his first speech as Speaker , gave a nod towards the Tea Party movement that backed many of the new members .
He promised the Republican objective would be to "" give government back to the people "" , ending a lot of the House conventions that he said had made for bad legislation .
Otherwise , his speech was largely free of the antagonistic , partisan politics that can be expected in the months ahead .
His relatively subdued tone was in keeping with a day in which members brought in their families to join them in the chamber .
Boehner has established a reputation in recent months for being emotional , given to frequent bouts of tears , and he was moist - eyed again as he wandered among colleagues , Democrats as well as Republicans , acknowledging their greetings .
He eventually pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed his nose .
A fellow Republican congressman , Jeb Hensarling , nominating Boehner , described him as one of 12 children from a working - class family in Ohio who , as a young man , had cleaned floors in his father 's bar .
Seven of his brothers and three of his sisters , as well as nephews and nieces , were in the chamber for his big moment .
In his speech Boehner said : "" We gather here today at a time of great challenges : Nearly one in 10 of our neighbours are looking for work , healthcare costs are still rising for families and small businesses , our spending has caught up with us and our debt will soon eclipse the size of our entire economy . ""
He added : "" Tough decisions will be required of the 112th Congress .
No longer can we fall short .
No longer can we kick the can down the road .
The people voted to end business as usual , and today we begin carrying out their instructions . ""
Pelosi promised to work with Boehner on legislation that "" creates jobs , strengthens our middle class and reduces the deficit "" .
But in reality there seems little scope for much compromise in the months ahead .
In the Senate the Democrats hold 53 seats ( including two independents ) in the 100-member chamber to the Republicans ' 47 .
Pelosi is staying on as Democratic leader in the House , in spite of outspoken criticism of her leadership , and she can expect future challenges .
Obama maintained a low presence , holed up in the White House as he worked on a reshuffle of his top team .
Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary and one of his closest confidantes , is to quit his post but will continue to give advice as an outside political consultant .
His departure , scheduled for next month , two years after taking the job , has been rumoured for months .
One of the biggest criticisms of the Obama administration is its failure to sell its political achievements and Gibbs , as press secretary , shared part of the responsibility .
The 39-year - old will continue to be part of the Obama inner circle , and is to spend part of his time preparing for the 2012 election campaign and making more television appearances in support of White House policy .
Along with the political strategist David Axelrod , he was the public face of the Obama presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008 .
Unlike Hillary Clinton 's press team , who came across as remote and disdainful , Gibbs and Axelrod were visible at events and ready to talk to journalists .
Gibbs even handed a journalist his BlackBerry to copy quotes from a speech in Atlanta .
Few press secretaries would trust a journalist with their BlackBerry for a minute , let alone 30 ."
2011-01-05,"Well , here we go .
After an interminable reading of the roll â€ “
yes , the names were called of all 435 members of the 112th House of Representatives â€ “ that was dull even by C - SPAN 's standards , the clerk announced at exactly 1.38pm this afternoon that John Boehner had received enough votes to be the next speaker .
The new Republican era was underway .
I remember very well the last time the Republicans took over the House of Representatives , under Newt Gingrich 15 years ago .
Gingrich was as outrageous and demagogic then as he is nowâ€”in 1991 he participated in the ghastly gay - baiting of the then - speaker , a Democrat , based on absolutely no evidence of any sort .
But there was , all the same , something
â€
¦ I ca n't quite type "" likeable "" , but original about him .
He thought , as they say , outside the box .
I 'll never forget that in his maiden speech as speaker , after he accept the gavel from the very man he 'd so cruelly slimed , he invoked Franklin Roosevelt .
You could hear liberal Democrats in the chamber gasp .
That took chutzpah .
Yes , Gingrich kept it interesting .
About this bunch , there is nothing interesting .
Most of them are as bland and odourless as they are mercilessly and unashamedly in the employ of corporate America .
The ones who are n't that are so far to the right that even corporations , at least some of them , are suspect , insofar as they can be woven into the fabric of dark conspiracies about how the government and the banks and Hollywood are out to capture "" your "" freedom and make "" you "" submit to coastal , elitist norms .
Who are these people ?
Here 's a small sampling .
Speaker John Boehner , one hears repeatedly , grew up the poor son of a publican and one of 12 children in the very conservative suburbs of Cincinnati , Ohio .
One hears less often that his net worth now is between $ 2 m and $ 7 m .
Majority Leader Eric Cantor has the distinction of being the only Jewish Republican in Congress .
He 's Boehner 's bad cop , basically .
Not long ago he mused that the Republicans might move aid to Israel out of the foreign aid category , because they want to rip into all foreign aid that is n't destined for Israel .
Darrell
Issa is a name to remember .
The Californian will chair the main government oversight committee , meaning that he will have the power to decide what investigations into alleged Obama administration misfeasance to launch .
The job comes with an investigative staff and subpoena power .
We 'll be hearing a lot from him .
Floridian Ileana Ros - Lehtinen will chair the foreign relations committee .
Reliably conservative like most Cuban - Americans of her generation , she used to seem really rightwing , but time and change have rendered her almost reasonable by comparison with her comrades , though she has little use for socialists or Palestinians .
Dave Camp will chair ways and means , the House 's most important committee .
He says that , like Barack Obama , he wants to reform the tax system .
One doubts the two have the same kind of reforms in mind .
The tax code , Camp likes to say , is "" 10 times the size of the Bible with none of the good news "" .
Wisconsin 's Paul Ryan will chair the budget committee .
He 's the one Republican in the House of Representatives who has evinced genuine and far - reaching curiosity about policy .
Needless to say , his future is up in the air .
Keep an eye on new senator Mike Lee of Utah .
In endorsing his opponent in the state 's GOP primary , the Salt Lake City newspaper wrote that both Lee and the opponent were "" radical "" but saw in the opponent "" at least a modicum of openness to the spectrum of ideas , a glimmer of a pragmatism .
We ca n't say that of Lee . ""
He should fit right in ."
2011-01-09,"The FBI and the Capitol Police are to carry out a review of security of members of Congress on Wednesday in the wake of the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords and one of her staff .
The new Speaker , John Boehner , said he had asked the sergeant at arms , the US Capitol police and the FBI to "" conduct an in - depth security overview "" .
He also asked them to brief members ' staff in offices round the country .
US Capitol police on Sunday called for members of Congress to take extra security steps .
A member of Congress , Jason Chaffetz , from Utah , said he will investigate whether US marshals , who guard federal judges , can be expanded to guard members of Congress .
There could be small changes , such as security being deployed for occasions regarded as particularly threatening .
But in reality not much else is likely to change .
The White House is like a fortress , relatively difficult for casual visitors to get inside and Barack Obama is protected round the clock .
But there are 535 members of Congress â€ “ 100 in the Senate and 435 in the House of Representativesâ€ “
and it would be too expensive to mount anything remotely close to the level of security Obama enjoys .
Even if members were offered the chance of personal security , many , probably most , would refuse .
There is a tradition of accessibility to lawmakers .
Members of the public , after passing through a metal detector at the entrance to Congress and its adjoining buildings , are relatively free to wander round the building .
They can see their representatives in the chamber , in committee hearings or at their offices .
Facing re - election every two years in the case of the house , members are keen to ensure constituents are not cut off from them .
Such a free and easy approach is even more evident back in their home districts , where members and their staff make themselves available at a host of meetings .
Members report that over the last two years , as the political rhetoric has grown more heated , there has been an increase in the number of threats , but this does not seem to have changed the views of members .
Mike Capuanao , a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts , told Politico website he was not changing his lifestyle .
He had installed a security system in his home when he was elected , but that was it . ""
Even if they gave us each a bodyguard many of us would n't take it , including myself , "" said Capuano .
"" The Capitol is pretty secure as far as I know , but when you 're out in the street there 's really not much you can do .
We all know there are nuts out there . """
2011-01-20,"The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , today received a sceptical and hostile reception when he visited the US Congress .
Both Republicans and Democrats attacked China 's human rights record and alleged currency manipulation at America 's expense , and accused Beijing of bullying its neighbours .
Hu held private meetings with John Boehner , the House Speaker , and the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , both of whom rejected invitations to the state dinner for the Chinese leader last night .
The Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell , also turned down an invitation to the dinner .
The only member of the Congressional "" big four "" to attend was the Democratic leader in the House and former Speaker , Nancy Pelosi .
The chilly reception on Capitol Hill contrasted with Hu 's day at the White House yesterday , where Barack Obama pressed the Chinese leader on human rights but otherwise emphasised common ground .
Reid – the most powerful Democrat in Congress – referred to Hu as a "" dictator "" in an interview on Tuesday .
He made a half - hearted retraction yesterday , saying : "" Maybe I should n't have said ' dictator , ' but they have a different type of government than we have – and that is an understatement .
"" Members of the House and Senate have expressed anger towards China over the strength of its currency – which they claim is being deliberately manipulated by Beijing – and threatened punitive measures .
The House foreign affairs committee held a meeting yesterday to coincide with Hu 's visit to the White House .
Among those at the meeting was Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher , who told CNN that Hu 's China was "" a gangster regime that murders its own people "" .
In a separate interview , Rohrabacher described the Chinese government as "" Nazis "" .
More than 80 members of Congress have signed a letter saying US patience with the currency dispute is exhausted , and more than 30 signed a separate letter calling for the release of the Chinese dissident and Nobel peace prizewinner Liu Xiaobo .
Sherrod Brown , a Democratic senator , said he would join the Republican senator Olympia Snowe to propose legislation to allow US companies to seek higher duties on some Chinese goods to compensate for China 's built - in currency advantage .
Although Pelosi attended the state dinner , her office issued a statement critical of China . ""
Since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 , there has been bipartisan concern in the Congress about the human rights situation in China and Tibet , the support of the Chinese government for rogue states , and China 's unfair trade practices , which have ballooned our trade deficit from $ 5bn a year to $ 5bn a week , "" she said .
John McCain , one of the Republicans due to meet Hu , told Reuters before the meeting : "" I will emphasise that China can not be a major influence in the world and abuse human rights .
They have not met our expectations and the predictions of many . """
2011-01-26,""" Mr Speaker , Mr Vice - President , Members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans : Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress , as well as your new Speaker , John Boehner .
And as we mark this occasion , we are also mindful of the empty chair in this Chamber , and pray for the health of our colleague – and our friend – Gabby Giffords .
It 's no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years .
The debates have been contentious ; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs .
And that 's a good thing .
That 's what a robust democracy demands .
That 's what helps set us apart as a nation .
But there 's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause .
Amid all the noise and passions and rancor of our public debate , Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from , each of us is a part of something greater – something more consequential than party or political preference .
We are part of the American family .
We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found , we are still bound together as one people ; that we share common hopes and a common creed ; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children , and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled .
That , too , is what sets us apart as a nation .
Now , by itself , this simple recognition wo n't usher in a new era of cooperation .
What comes of this moment is up to us .
What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight , but whether we can work together tomorrow .
I believe we can .
I believe we must .
That 's what the people who sent us here expect of us .
With their votes , they 've determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties .
New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans .
We will move forward together , or not at all – for the challenges we face are bigger than party , and bigger than politics .
At stake right now is not who wins the next election – after all , we just had an election .
At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country , or somewhere else .
It 's whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded .
It 's whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map , but a light to the world .
We are poised for progress .
Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known , the stock market has come roaring back .
Corporate profits are up .
The economy is growing again .
But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone .
We measure progress by the success of our people .
By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer .
By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise .
By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children .
That 's the project the American people want us to work on .
Together .
We did that in December .
Thanks to the tax cuts we passed , Americans ' paychecks are a little bigger today .
Every business can write off the full cost of the new investments they make this year .
These steps , taken by Democrats and Republicans , will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year .
But we have more work to do .
The steps we 've taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession – but to win the future , we 'll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making .
Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown .
You did n't always need a degree , and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors .
If you worked hard , chances are you 'd have a job for life , with a decent paycheck , good benefits , and the occasional promotion .
Maybe you 'd even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company .
That world has changed .
And for many , the change has been painful .
I 've seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories , and the vacant storefronts of once busy Main Streets .
I 've heard it in the frustrations of Americans who 've seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear – proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game .
They 're right .
The rules have changed .
In a single generation , revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live , work and do business .
Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100 .
Today , just about any company can set up shop , hire workers , and sell their products wherever there 's an internet connection .
Meanwhile , nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own , they could compete in this new world .
And so they started educating their children earlier and longer , with greater emphasis on math and science .
They 're investing in research and new technologies .
Just recently , China became home to the world 's largest private solar research facility , and the world 's fastest computer .
So yes , the world has changed .
The competition for jobs is real .
But this should n't discourage us .
It should challenge us .
Remember – for all the hits we 've taken these last few years , for all the naysayers predicting our decline , America still has the largest , most prosperous economy in the world .
No workers are more productive than ours .
No country has more successful companies , or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs .
We are home to the world 's best colleges and universities , where more students come to study than any other place on Earth .
What 's more , we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea – the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny .
That is why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here .
It 's why our students do n't just memorize equations , but answer questions like "" What do you think of that idea ?
What would you change about the world ?
What do you want to be when you grow up ? ""
The future is ours to win .
But to get there , we ca n't just stand still .
As Robert Kennedy told us , "" The future is not a gift .
It is an achievement . ""
Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat .
It has required each generation to sacrifice , and struggle , and meet the demands of a new age .
Now it 's our turn .
We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time .
We need to out - innovate , out - educate , and out - build the rest of the world .
We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business .
We need to take responsibility for our deficit , and reform our government .
That 's how our people will prosper .
That 's how we 'll win the future .
And tonight , I 'd like to talk about how we get there .
The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation .
None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be , or where the new jobs will come from .
Thirty years ago , we could n't know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution .
What we can do – what America does better than anyone – is spark the creativity and imagination of our people .
We are the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices ; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers ; of Google and Facebook .
In America , innovation does n't just change our lives .
It 's how we make a living .
Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation .
But because it 's not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research , throughout history our government has provided cutting - edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need .
That 's what planted the seeds for the Internet .
That 's what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS .
Just think of all the good jobs – from manufacturing to retail – that have come from those breakthroughs .
Half a century ago , when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik¸ we had no idea how we 'd beat them to the moon .
The science was n't there yet .
NASA did n't even exist .
But after investing in better research and education , we did n't just surpass the Soviets ; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs .
This is our generation 's Sputnik moment .
Two years ago , I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we have n't seen since the height of the Space Race .
In a few weeks , I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal .
We 'll invest in biomedical research , information technology , and especially clean energy technology – an investment that will strengthen our security , protect our planet , and create countless new jobs for our people .
Already , we are seeing the promise of renewable energy .
Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company .
After September 11th , they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon .
But half of their factory went unused , and the recession hit them hard .
Today , with the help of a government loan , that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country .
In Robert 's words , "" We reinvented ourselves .
"" That 's what Americans have done for over two hundred years : reinvented ourselves .
And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers , we 've begun to reinvent our energy policy .
We 're not just handing out money .
We 're issuing a challenge .
We 're telling America 's scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields , and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy , we 'll fund the Apollo Projects of our time .
At the California Institute of Technology , they 're developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars .
At Oak Ridge National Laboratory , they 're using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities .
With more research and incentives , we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels , and become the first country to have 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 .
We need to get behind this innovation .
And to help pay for it , I 'm asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies .
I do n't know if you 've noticed , but they 're doing just fine on their own .
So instead of subsidizing yesterday 's energy , let 's invest in tomorrow 's .
Now , clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they 're selling .
So tonight , I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal : by 2035 , 80 % of America 's electricity will come from clean energy sources .
Some folks want wind and solar .
Others want nuclear , clean coal , and natural gas .
To meet this goal , we will need them all – and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen .
Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America 's success .
But if we want to win the future – if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas – then we also have to win the race to educate our kids .
Think about it .
Over the next ten years , nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree .
And yet , as many as a quarter of our students are n't even finishing high school .
The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations .
America has fallen to 9th in the proportion of young people with a college degree .
And so the question is whether all of us – as citizens , and as parents – are willing to do what 's necessary to give every child a chance to succeed .
That responsibility begins not in our classrooms , but in our homes and communities .
It 's family that first instills the love of learning in a child .
Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done .
We need to teach our kids that it 's not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated , but the winner of the science fair ; that success is not a function of fame or PR , but of hard work and discipline .
Our schools share this responsibility .
When a child walks into a classroom , it should be a place of high expectations and high performance .
But too many schools do n't meet this test .
That 's why instead of just pouring money into a system that 's not working , we launched a competition called Race to the Top .
To all fifty states , we said , "" If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement , we 'll show you the money . ""
Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation .
For less than one percent of what we spend on education each year , it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning .
These standards were developed , not by Washington , but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country .
And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child
Left Behind with a law that is more flexible and focused on what 's best for our kids .
You see , we know what 's possible for our children when reform is n't just a top - down mandate , but the work of local teachers and principals ; school boards and communities .
Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver .
Three years ago , it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado ; located on turf between two rival gangs .
But last May , 97 % of the seniors received their diploma .
Most will be the first in their family to go to college .
And after the first year of the school 's transformation , the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said "" Thank you , Mrs. Waters , for showing … that we are smart and we can make it . ""
Let 's also remember that after parents , the biggest impact on a child 's success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom .
In South Korea , teachers are known as "" nation builders . ""
Here in America , it 's time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect .
We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones .
And over the next ten years , with so many Baby Boomers retiring from our classrooms , we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science , technology , engineering , and math .
In fact , to every young person listening tonight who 's contemplating their career choice : If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation ; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child – become a teacher .
Your country needs you .
Of course , the education race does n't end with a high school diploma .
To compete , higher education must be within reach of every American .
That 's why we 've ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks , and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students .
And this year , I ask Congress to go further , and make permanent our tuition tax credit – worth $ 10,000 for four years of college .
Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today 's fast - changing economy , we are also revitalizing America 's community colleges .
Last month , I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina .
Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town .
One mother of two , a woman named Kathy Proctor , had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old .
And she told me she 's earning her degree in biotechnology now , at 55 years old , not just because the furniture jobs are gone , but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams too .
As Kathy said , "" I hope it tells them to never give up . ""
If we take these steps – if we raise expectations for every child , and give them the best possible chance at an education , from the day they 're born until the last job they take – we will reach the goal I set two years ago : by the end of the decade , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world .
One last point about education .
Today , there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens .
Some are the children of undocumented workers , who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents .
They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag , and yet live every day with the threat of deportation .
Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities .
But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees , we send them back home to compete against us .
It makes no sense .
Now , I strongly believe that we should take on , once and for all , the issue of illegal immigration .
I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders , enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows .
I know that debate will be difficult and take time .
But tonight , let 's agree to make that effort .
And let 's stop expelling talented , responsible young people who can staff our research labs , start new businesses , and further enrich this nation .
The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America .
To attract new businesses to our shores , we need the fastest , most reliable ways to move people , goods , and information – from high - speed rail to high - speed internet .
Our infrastructure used to be the best – but our lead has slipped .
South Korean homes now have greater internet access than we do .
Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do .
China is building faster trains and newer airports .
Meanwhile , when our own engineers graded our nation 's infrastructure , they gave us a "" D. "" We have to do better .
America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad , brought electricity to rural communities , and constructed the interstate highway system .
The jobs created by these projects did n't just come from laying down tracks or pavement .
They came from businesses that opened near a town 's new train station or the new off - ramp .
Over the last two years , we have begun rebuilding for the 21st century , a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard - hit construction industry .
Tonight , I 'm proposing that we redouble these efforts .
We will put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges .
We will make sure this is fully paid for , attract private investment , and pick projects based on what 's best for the economy , not politicians .
Within 25 years , our goal is to give 80 % of Americans access to high - speed rail , which could allow you go places in half the time it takes to travel by car .
For some trips , it will be faster than flying – without the pat - down .
As we speak , routes in California and the Midwest are already underway .
Within the next five years , we will make it possible for business to deploy the next generation of high - speed wireless coverage to 98 % of all Americans .
This is n't just about a faster internet and fewer dropped calls .
It 's about connecting every part of America to the digital age .
It 's about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world .
It 's about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device ; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook ; or a patient who can have face - to - face video chats with her doctor .
All these investments – in innovation , education , and infrastructure – will make America a better place to do business and create jobs .
But to help our companies compete , we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success .
Over the years , a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries .
Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all .
But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world .
It makes no sense , and it has to change .
So tonight , I 'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system .
Get rid of the loopholes .
Level the playing field .
And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years – without adding to our deficit .
To help businesses sell more products abroad , we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 – because the more we export , the more jobs we create at home .
Already , our exports are up .
Recently , we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs in the United States .
And last month , we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs .
This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor ; Democrats and Republicans , and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible .
Before I took office , I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements , and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers , and promote American jobs .
That 's what we did with Korea , and that 's what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia , and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks .
To reduce barriers to growth and investment , I 've ordered a review of government regulations .
When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses , we will fix them .
But I will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the American people .
That 's what we 've done in this country for more than a century .
It 's why our food is safe to eat , our water is safe to drink , and our air is safe to breathe .
It 's why we have speed limits and child labor laws .
It 's why last year , we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies , and new rules to prevent another financial crisis .
And it 's why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients .
Now , I 've heard rumors that a few of you have some concerns about the new health care law .
So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved .
If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable , I am eager to work with you .
We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses .
What I 'm not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a pre - existing condition .
I 'm not willing to tell James Howard , a brain cancer patient from Texas , that his treatment might not be covered .
I 'm not willing to tell Jim Houser , a small business owner from Oregon , that he has to go back to paying $ 5,000 more to cover his employees .
As we speak , this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their parents ' coverage .
So instead of re - fighting the battles of the last two years , let 's fix what needs fixing and move forward .
Now , the final step – a critical step – in winning the future is to make sure we are n't buried under a mountain of debt .
We are living with a legacy of deficit - spending that began almost a decade ago .
And in the wake of the financial crisis , some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing , save jobs , and put money in people 's pockets .
But now that the worst of the recession is over , we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in .
That is not sustainable .
Every day , families sacrifice to live within their means .
They deserve a government that does the same .
So tonight , I am proposing that starting this year , we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years .
This would reduce the deficit by more than $ 400 billion over the next decade , and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president .
This freeze will require painful cuts .
Already , we have frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years .
I 've proposed cuts to things I care deeply about , like community action programs .
The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without .
I recognize that some in this Chamber have already proposed deeper cuts , and I 'm willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without .
But let 's make sure that we 're not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens .
And let 's make sure what we 're cutting is really excess weight .
Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine .
It may feel like you 're flying high at first , but it wo n't take long before you 'll feel the impact .
Now , most of the cuts and savings I 've proposed only address annual domestic spending , which represents a little more than 12 % of our budget .
To make further progress , we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough .
It wo n't .
The bipartisan Fiscal Commission I created last year made this crystal clear .
I do n't agree with all their proposals , but they made important progress .
And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it – in domestic spending , defense spending , health care spending , and spending through tax breaks and loopholes .
This means further reducing health care costs , including programs like Medicare and Medicaid , which are the single biggest contributor to our long - term deficit .
Health insurance reform will slow these rising costs , which is part of why nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit .
Still , I 'm willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs , including one that Republicans suggested last year : medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits .
To put us on solid ground , we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations .
And we must do it without putting at risk current retirees , the most vulnerable , or people with disabilities ; without slashing benefits for future generations ; and without subjecting Americans ' guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market .
And if we truly care about our deficit , we simply can not afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 % of Americans .
Before we take money away from our schools , or scholarships away from our students , we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break .
It 's not a matter of punishing their success .
It 's about promoting America 's success .
In fact , the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code .
This will be a tough job , but members of both parties have expressed interest in doing this , and I am prepared to join them .
So now is the time to act .
Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress – Democrats and Republicans – to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done .
If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits , we can make the investments we need to win the future .
Let me take this one step further .
We should n't just give our people a government that 's more affordable .
We should give them a government that 's more competent and efficient .
We can not win the future with a government of the past .
We live and do business in the information age , but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black and white TV .
There are twelve different agencies that deal with exports .
There are at least five different entities that deal with housing policy .
Then there 's my favorite example : the Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they 're in fresh water , but the Commerce Department handles them in when they 're in saltwater .
And I hear it gets even more complicated once they 're smoked .
Now , we have made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste .
Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse .
We 're selling acres of federal office space that has n't been used in years , and we will cut through red tape to get rid of more .
But we need to think bigger .
In the coming months , my administration will develop a proposal to merge , consolidate , and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America .
I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote – and we will push to get it passed .
In the coming year , we will also work to rebuild people 's faith in the institution of government .
Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent , you will be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history .
Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists , I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done : put that information online .
And because the American people deserve to know that special interests are n't larding up legislation with pet projects , both parties in Congress should know this : if a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside , I will veto it .
A 21st century government that 's open and competent .
A government that lives within its means .
An economy that 's driven by new skills and ideas .
Our success in this new and changing world will require reform , responsibility , and innovation .
It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs .
Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders , so can new threats and new challenges .
No single wall separates East and West ; no one rival superpower is aligned against us .
And so we must defeat determined enemies wherever they are , and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion .
America 's moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom , justice , and dignity .
And because we have begun this work , tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America 's standing has been restored .
Look to Iraq , where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high ; where American combat patrols have ended ; violence has come down ; and a new government has been formed .
This year , our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people , while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq .
America 's commitment has been kept ; the Iraq War is coming to an end .
Of course , as we speak , al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us .
Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals , we are disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies .
And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders , we are responding with the strength of our communities , with respect for the rule of law , and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family .
We have also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad .
In Afghanistan , our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan Security Forces .
Our purpose is clear – by preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people , we will deny al Qaeda the safe - haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11 .
Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians , fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency .
There will be tough fighting ahead , and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance .
But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them .
This year , we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead .
And this July , we will begin to bring our troops home .
In Pakistan , al Qaeda 's leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001 .
Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield .
Their safe - havens are shrinking .
And we have sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe : we will not relent , we will not waver , and we will defeat you .
American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war .
Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START Treaty , far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed .
Because we rallied the world , nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists .
Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations , the Iranian government now faces tougher and tighter sanctions than ever before .
And on the Korean peninsula , we stand with our ally South Korea , and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons .
This is just a part of how we are shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity .
With our European allies , we revitalized NATO , and increased our cooperation on everything from counter - terrorism to missile defense .
We have reset our relationship with Russia , strengthened Asian alliances , and built new partnerships with nations like India .
This March , I will travel to Brazil , Chile , and El Salvador to forge new alliances for progress in the Americas .
Around the globe , we are standing with those who take responsibility – helping farmers grow more food ; supporting doctors who care for the sick ; and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity .
Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power – it must be the purpose behind it .
In South Sudan – with our assistance – the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war .
Thousands lined up before dawn .
People danced in the streets .
One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him : "" This was a battlefield for most of my life .
Now we want to be free .
"" We saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia , where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator .
And tonight , let us be clear : the United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia , and supports the democratic aspirations of all people .
We must never forget that the things we 've struggled for , and fought for , live in the hearts of people everywhere .
And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country .
Tonight , let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families .
Let us serve them as well as they have served us – by giving them the equipment they need ; by providing them with the care and benefits they have earned ; and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation .
Our troops come from every corner of this country – they are black , white , Latino , Asian and Native American .
They are Christian and Hindu , Jewish and Muslim .
And , yes , we know that some of them are gay .
Starting this year , no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love .
And with that change , I call on all of our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and the ROTC .
It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past .
It is time to move forward as one nation .
We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us .
Reforming our schools ; changing the way we use energy ; reducing our deficit – none of this is easy .
All of it will take time .
And it will be harder because we will argue about everything .
The cost .
The details .
The letter of every law .
Of course , some countries do n't have this problem .
If the central government wants a railroad , they get a railroad –
no matter how many homes are bulldozed .
If they do n't want a bad story in the newspaper , it does n't get written .
And yet , as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be , I know there is n't a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth .
We may have differences in policy , but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution .
We may have different opinions , but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try .
We may have different backgrounds , but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything 's possible .
No matter who you are .
No matter where you come from .
That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight .
That dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can stand behind me .
That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father 's Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth .
That dream – that American Dream – is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era .
It 's what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future .
And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher .
Brandon started a company in Berlin , Pennsylvania that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology .
One day last summer , he saw the news that halfway across the world , 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine , and no one knew how to save them .
But Brandon thought his company could help .
And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B.
His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment .
And Brandon left for Chile .
Along with others , he began drilling a 2,000 foot hole into the ground , working three or four days at a time with no sleep .
Thirty - seven days later , Plan B succeeded , and the miners were rescued .
But because he did n't want all of the attention , Brandon was n't there when the miners emerged .
He had already gone home , back to work on his next project .
Later , one of his employees said of the rescue , "" We proved that Center Rock is a little company , but we do big things .
"" We do big things .
From the earliest days of our founding , America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream .
That 's how we win the future .
We are a nation that says , "" I might not have a lot of money , but I have this great idea for a new company .
I might not come from a family of college graduates , but I will be the first to get my degree .
I might not know those people in trouble , but I think I can help them , and I need to try .
I 'm not sure how we 'll reach that better place beyond the horizon , but I know we 'll get there .
I know we will .
"" We do big things .
The idea of America endures .
Our destiny remains our choice .
And tonight , more than two centuries later , it is because of our people that our future is hopeful , our journey goes forward , and the state of our union is strong .
Thank you , God Bless you , and may God Bless the United States of America . """
2011-02-09,"Around the world , people are fascinated by the political tussle between Democrats and Republicans over attempts to repeal the landmark US healthcare bill passed last year .
Few people realise , however , that if the new Republican - dominated House of Representatives gets its way , it wo n't just be Americans who are affected .
As part of his repeal effort , House speaker John Boehner is intent on reintroducing the "" global gag "" rule , a policy that would endanger the lives of millions of women worldwide .
America 's culture wars may be coming to a country near you .
The global gag rule , officially known as the Mexico City policy , was introduced by the Reagan administration in 1984 , during the United Nation 's International Conference on Population in Mexico City .
The policy prevents US overseas assistance from going to organisations that provide information on abortion , perform abortions or direct women to abortion providers .
Because the rule denies funding to organisations that simply counsel women on abortion issues , not just those that perform abortion , family planning Women from developing countries have been let down by the UN , say charitiesfacilities around the world cut back services , close facilities and raise their fees to cover lost income thereby reducing access to their services .
These services include contraceptive distribution vital to the prevention of HIV / Aids .
When George W Bush restarted the ideological war against family planning by reintroducing the gag rule in 2001 , shipments of condoms and contraceptives from USAID was immediately halted to 16 countries .
The impact was devastating .
Population Action International , an independent research organisation on family planning , reported that in Kenya five of the most established family planning clinics closed – many of which were the only affordable options in their areas .
In Lesotho , where one quarter of women suffer from HIV / Aids , all condom donations from USAID were cut off .
With fewer organisations to counsel on safe sex , and with fewer or no contraceptives to distribute , the gag rule actually increases the spread of HIV / Aids in some of the worse affected countries .
This , of course , runs directly against official American policy aimed at reducing the number of global HIV infections .
Even more perversely , the policy is self - defeating .
Research illustrates that instead of curbing abortions , the number of abortions increased .
Countries with family planning services have lower rates of abortion than those without .
Because women can not get access to contraceptives and advice , they end up reliant on the last ditch option when pregnant : abortion .
Often , desperate women resort to dangerous non - clinical practices in the absence of professional medical care .
The results are horrific and inhumane .
Republicans are quick to accuse those who advocate for a woman 's right to chose of being pro - abortion .
The reality is that we are pro - health .
Being pro - choice is not equivalent to being pro - abortion .
Rather , we understand that this is an issue best left to a woman and her doctor .
Abortion is a fact of life , like it or not , and studies have shown that one of the best ways to reduce abortions is to offer preventive family planning , as well as immediate post - abortion family planning and counselling .
The figures from one study on immediate post - abortion counselling in Turkey are revealing : the number of clients using contraception after an abortion and subsequent counselling rose from 67 % to 91 % in one year ; and the number of abortions dropped over the decade from 4,100 in 1992 to 1,709 in 1998 .
The global gag rule undermines America 's HIV / Aids policy , it risks the lives of countless women and it undermines a core American value – the freedom of speech .
Women should have access to a wide variety of family planning and health counselling that should include everything from abstinence to abortion .
To argue otherwise , given the evidence at hand , is not just reprehensible ; it is immoral ."
2011-02-20,"Republicans pushed through a draconian series of budget cuts worth tens of billions of dollars on Saturday , raising the prospect of a showdown with President Barack Obama .
Emboldened by their 2010 midterm election victory and swelled by Tea Party - backed newcomers , the Republican - controlled House of Representatives signed off on federal spending cuts worth $ 61bn .
The axe will fall on federal money for public broadcasting , environmental programmes , Obama 's healthcare reforms and the family planning organisation Planned Parenthood .
Even Obama 's own staff face $ 120 m of cuts .
Personnel would be withdrawn from key areas including the reform of Wall Street .
Some government agencies face budget cuts as high as 40 % ; the largest reduction in federal government spending since the second world war . ""
For the first time in many years , the people 's house was allowed to work its will â€ “ and the result was one of the largest spending cuts in American history , "" said the Republican house speaker , John Boehner .
"" We will not stop here in our efforts to cut spending , not when we 're broke and Washington 's spending binge is making it harder to create jobs .
"" The measures were staunchly opposed by Democrats in Congress , but the Republican party showed its new - found strength by forcing the issue to a vote in the early hours of Saturday morning .
At 4.35am , the roll call was finally called and the Republicans won by 235 votes to 192 .
All Democrats had opposed the cuts , but they persuaded only three Republicans to join them .
The move sets up a showdown with the White House and the Democrat - controlled Senate .
Obama has said that he will use his presidential veto unless some of the cuts are tempered .
The debate is part of a wider argument about the role of government in America and the scope of federal spending in the face of the recession and spiralling US deficits .
Republicans and Democrats now look likely to go head - to - head in the coming months in a fight that could even shut down the government .
A federal budget needs to be passed by 4 March , but if the current cuts can not be agreed , the government may be forced to temporarily close , as happened in 1995 during the first Clinton administration .
So far Republicans have shown little sign of backing off , especially as they now have a need to satisfy the demands of the anti - government Tea Party movement .
"" These are going to be the most important two , three , four months that we have seen in this town in decades .
It 's all one fight , "" said Boehner .
He and the Republicans have argued that government spending has become unsustainable even as they have pushed through a series of massive tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans worth hundreds of billions of dollars .
Democrats , meanwhile , say that government spending is vital while unemployment remains high and that severe cuts will only add sacked federal workers to the long lines of the jobless . ""
A lot of them [ Republicans ] do n't know the ramifications in their own communities of what they 're doing , "" csaid Steny Hoyer , a senior Democratic congressman from Maryland .
The debate is being played out in even more dramatic terms at a local level , as state and city governments try to impose massive spending cuts in the face of huge gaps in their budgets .
America was captivated last week by scenes in Wisconsin where tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets over measures pushed through by the state 's new Tea Party - backed Republican governor , Scott Walker .
The liberal - leaning cable news channel MSNBC broadcast some shows live from Wisconsin , while pictures of a reporter from the conservative Fox network being berated by outraged demonstrators went viral on the internet .
Walker 's proposals to slash Wisconsin 's spending hit state workers hard , and would effectively take away many of their union rights .
Democratic lawmakers in Wisconsin have fled the state in order to delay a vote on the issue .
In turn , Walker has threatened to call out the National Guard to maintain public order in the face of protests and also to use the police to force Democratic politicians back to the state .
Huge union protests were planned for Saturday in Wisconsin as well as counter - protests by Tea Party supporters .
Proposals similar to the Wisconsin legislation have also been put forward in Ohio and several other states ."
2011-02-21,"Months , even weeks , ago it might have been seen as inconceivable .
But now , politicians on both sides of the aisle are bracing themselves for the perfect political storm : a showdown over government shutdown .
That 's right : in a mere matter of weeks , we may be looking at another government shutdown along the lines of 1995 , when President Clinton and the Republican - controlled Congress feuded over funding for critical government programmes .
The government 's current spending authorisation ends on the 4 March and reauthorisation must be granted to avoid a complete shutdown of government , government services and the employment of civil servants .
Congress can pass a temporary funding resolution to keep the government operating â€ “ something that happened habitually under President Bush , whose demands to fund the Iraq war were frequent .
But this time , Republicans will likely refuse to pass that funding resolution , thus triggering a shutdown .
The result of the same situation in 1995 was a massive public repudiation of an unreasonable Republican party , seen as willing to risk the very operation of government to appease their base .
And that was one of the main drivers that propelled Clinton back to the Oval Office in 1996 .
Yet , this time , Republicans are convinced it might make sense to pick this fight
â€ “ conscious of the agitation of their base and the Tea Party 's appetite for indiscriminate budget cuts , regardless of consequences .
The makings of the showdown were painfully obvious last week , as members of the Republican party demanded â€ “ under massive pressure from Tea Party - backed representatives â€ “ further spending cuts in the congressional resolution being debated in the House of Representatives .
House speaker John Boehner and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell opened a massive game of chicken by declaring that they would reject a short - term extension of any spending whatsoever â€ “ the spending necessary to keep all functions of government open and running â€ “ without further draconian cuts to those spending levels .
In turn , President Obama , with public support firmly behind him , could very well veto the funding cuts , forcing the Republicans to back down .
Democrats are already in political ecstasy about the possibility .
As Nadeam Elshami , a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi said : "" The last thing the American people need is for congressional Republicans â€ ¦ to draw a line in the sand that hinders keeping the government open . ""
And a high - ranking aide to Pelosi told chiefs of staff on the hill that a government shutdown is more likely than not .
Republican leaders , despite their bravado , are painfully conscious of the potential political fallout .
In fact , majority leader Eric Cantor summoned the Tea Party members and their freshmen colleagues on Friday to "" educate them about the politics of a government shutdown "" .
Aides insisted this meeting was not to warn off the lawmakers from spending cuts , but the very fact that the meeting was called and focused on this issue already smacks of political discomfort .
Government departments are already bracing for the storm .
The social security administration last week warned their workers that temporary work stoppages might be needed .
And the proposed cuts by Republicans of $ 1.7bn to that department might not only shut down those government offices temporarily , but seriously hurt the benefits offered to senior citizens and those with disabilities .
That means social security claims would go unprocessed and pile up , causing bureaucratic congestion and personal hardship across the country .
All severe consequences .
And easily avoidable .
The reality is that a little negotiation could avoid even the partisan posturing .
Democrats are ready to negotiate , understanding the Republican leaders ' need to placate their base .
New York Senator Chuck Schumer has emphasised that cuts could be achieved as the result of "" fair negotiations "" .
In other words , the Republicans are proposing their road or the road to shutdown , while Democrats remain ready to work on compromise .
Being made to look the bad guys is exactly the scenario Republican leaders do n't want .
Once again , this is a reflection of a number of factors at play .
First , simple partisan politics : Republicans believe they have a winning message with the meat cleaver cuts they are proposing .
After all , that was the message they believe propelled so many of their freshmen members to victory last November .
But they forget that what works in swing districts might not appeal to the whole country , especially when seniors stop receiving their social security cheques .
Second , the continuing power of the Tea Party io hold more moderate Republicans "" accountable "" ( read : hostage ) to deliver on massive spending cuts .
For them , it 's the first â€ “ the only â€ “ priority , and they have an almost admirable disregard for the political consequences and their chances of re - election .
For the Republican party as a whole , the consequences could be nothing less than disastrous in 2012 .
But for now , we can but watch the clock tick towards 4 March and the possibility of a government shutdown on a scale never seen before in the western world ."
2011-02-28,"A bit like the Republican party , they are white , seemingly indestructible and bad for the environment .
But after an absence of four years , foam plastic coffee cups have made a comeback in the basement coffee shop of the United States Congress building after Republicans began reversing a series of in - house green initiatives undertaken by Democrats .
The about - turn was announced by a press aide to John Boehner , the speaker of the House of Representatives , who tweeted on Monday morning : "" The new majority – plasticware is back "" .
When the Democrats held the house , the former speaker Nancy Pelosi put the cafeterias at the centre of a plan to hugely reduce the carbon footprint of Congress .
The ancient power plant in Washington DC a few blocks from the Capitol building , which provides heating and cooling for Congress and the supreme court , was converted from coal to natural gas .
Compact fluorescent lighting and energy - efficient vending machines were introduced .
In the cafeterias , polystyrene packaging was replaced with trays and utensils made of biodegradable corn starch .
Four separate stations were installed for recycling and sorting .
A healthier menu was also introduced in 2008 , offering cage - free eggs and antibiotic - free beef .
Items deemed compostable waste , such as coffee cups , were sent to a pulper in a lower basement , which squeezed out all the liquid before dispatching the material by truck to a commercial composting site in the suburbs of Washington DC .
There , the waste was mixed with soil , which eventually returned to Capitol Hill to be used as fertiliser on the grounds .
Hundreds of tonnes of waste was saved from landfills yearly , Democrats said .
But the new green cafeteria was not universally popular – even when Democrats were in charge .
Diners complained the cutlery would bend or break on the point of contact with solid food .
Once Republicans were back in charge of the house , with their suspicion of environmental protection , the days of compostable coffee cups were numbered .
Dan Lungren , chair of the house administration committee , said the $ 475,000 per year programme was too expensive and not even green . ""
After a thorough review of the house 's composting operations , I have concluded that it is neither cost effective nor energy efficient to continue the programme , "" he said in a statement on his website .
Next on the Republican agenda of environmental retro moves ?
Lightbulbs .
House Republicans introduced a bill last week to repeal the government 's decision to phase out the old energy - inefficient bulbs , which was due to start in 2012 .
Environmental organisations condemned the return to plastic .
"" They are willing to undo progress when they should be looking at getting their own house in order . "" said Tony Iallonardo of the National Wildlife Federation ."
2011-03-18,"As turmoil sweeps the globe , the crisis of leadership at all levels in America continues to dominate conservative opinion - makers .
Rush Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh addressed concerns that cracks are starting to show within the GOP , the party famous for its zero tolerance policy on dissent , as compromise - averse hardliners create headaches for House majority leader John Boehner ( listen to clip ) . ""
So here we have in Politico today :
"" Some in GOP Grow Tired of Right Wing . ""
Now , keep in mind , none of these people in the GOP would be in power if it were n't for the right wing .
It is Politico , so we have to allow for some exaggeration .
But this story says : ' Some veteran Republican House members are pushing back against conservative deficit hawks who are pushing for endlessly deep spending cuts , saying the right wing of the party is creating unnecessary divisions for the GOP majority . '
"" Limbaugh is referring to a recent Politico article that outlined the challenges Boehner is facing trying to cut a budget deal .
On Tuesday , 54 House Republicans demonstrated that it 's their way or no way when they rejected the three - week stopgap budget bill that temporarily averted a government shutdown .
Now Boehner finds himself in an untenable Catch-22 situation as he tries to cut a final budget deal by early April : he can appease his own party 's rightwing zealots by agreeing to $ 61bn in cuts and multiple social policy riders that will never be accepted by Senate Democrats or the Democratic White House , or he can stand up to the hardliners and risk being seen as betraying the Tea Party ideology that helped consolidate the Republican House majority in the last election .
Limbaugh makes it very clear what he thinks will happen if the Tea Party purists do not get their way .
Third party .
That 's what will happen .
The Tea Party will throw out , in nominating fights , the people they think are not up - to - snuff – and if that does n't work , eventually , they 're gon na go third party .
I think what everybody misunderstands about this Tea Party business –
and I think it 's one of the reasons why it 's resented , and I think one of the reasons that the intelligentsia on both sides has problems with Palin , because she 's associated with it – is that the Tea Party does n't have a leader .
It 's not of Washington .
It 's not of Yale .
It 's not of Harvard .
It is not of Brown or Temple or Trinity or any of these other places .
It 's right out there in good , old - fashioned grassroots – and if you want to kill the Tea Party , there 's no one person to go to , to kill it .
You got ta kill principles .
You 've got ta wipe out total ideas ( listen to clip ) .
Clearly , to a man of principle like Limbaugh , who has been gunning for a government shutdown since the budget debate began , it 's far more important that our elected leaders maintain their ideological purity than engage in the messy business of compromise and actually governing .
Laura Ingraham Laura Ingraham appears convinced that America 's president is just not up to the task of dealing with the multiple crisis going on in the world ( listen to clip ) .
"" As always , this Friday , the news is stunning across the globe , not only this historic and hideous earthquake and tsunami that has hit Japan , but , of course , the devastation that continues to be wrought on the American economy through the collapse of leadership , our leadership role in the world . ""
The disaster in Japan , the violence being unleashed on civilians in Libya , Bahrain and elsewhere in the Middle East and the general chaos in the world , have Ingraham growing increasingly worried about her own future and about her children 's future .
She also seems to believe that if we only had a different kind of a president , one with less of a penchant for nuance ( someone like Reagan , for instance ) , we would have a better chance at averting an environmental catastrophe like the one we are currently witnessing in Japan or future terrorist attacks on US soil .
We have to be strong : we do n't have any choice , we have to have a country that is ready to lead and a president that is ready to lead .
Guess what , we 're a blink of an eye away from something happening in this country , and we have to live that way , unfortunately .
that 's just the way it is .
We can not leave ourselves so vulnerable economically that one of these types of hits against the United States is going to cripple us .
If we find ourselves in that position and we 're hit by a devastating natural disaster or a cataclysmic terrorist attack , I fear for our country , I really do .
Ingraham 's fears for her country may well be justifiable , but I 'm not sure that there will ever be a president , no matter how strong they purport to be , or how "" ready to lead "" , who can do a whole lot to prevent an earthquake .
Michael Savage Michael Savage is completely disenchanted at this point by President Obama 's failure to contain the Japanese earthquake and would have him impeached if only the Constitution permitted it ( listen to clip ) .
"" The fact of the matter is , this is astounding , and if there was a clause in the Constitution that permitted impeachment for other than crimes and misdemeanours there 'd be impeachment hearings .
That 's if we had a real Congress .
Because no country can survive a man as vacuous , or shall I say , the hollow man that we have in the White House .
This is astounding , ladies and gentlemen , but it 's to be expected if you 'd studied Obama the invisible or Obama the imaginary or Obama the pretender , from the beginning . ""
Anyway , being forced to accept that he 's stuck with the president for the time being , the most pressing concern for Savage , who lives in California , is that while we are suffering from this leadership deficit , some people who , he believes , are unduly worried about being exposed to radiation will end up taking bad advice .
This is extremely serious , as you well know – or do you well know what 's going on ?
I hope you do .
But it 's not time for panic .
I certainly would n't take the advice of the sturgeoun [ sic ] general who is recommending you all rush out and buy potassium iodide .
The reason is very clear .
Potassium iodide is a potentially toxic substance , especially when you do n't need it
and I 'm afraid that many people are so panicked right now because of the dumb sturgeon general and the misinformation out there , that they 're going to start taking potassium iodide as a preventive .
Nothing could be worse .
Do n't do it !
Eat sea food .
Eat deep water fish .
Eat kelp from organic seabed wherever you can find it .
The reason Savage believes it falls on him to step in is that the president listens to no one except his wife and mother - in - law , and as a result , he is growing more like the mad King Ludwig of Bavaria who bankrupted the Bavarian treasuries back in the day by insisting on building palaces in the image of Versailles that the state could not afford .
Obama , according to Savage , is our Mad King Ludwig .
But just like King Ludwig , who bankrupted the treasuries of Bavaria while his ministers were saying , "" Stop , King ; stop , King ; stop , King : we ca n't afford to build the Schloss Herrenchiemsee , which is a mimic of the hall of the palace of Versailles .
We do n't have the money .
""
The king kept building it .
The king kept building it until he bankrupted the treasury .
It 's the same with Obama .
Obamacare is sort of like the palace of Versaille : it 's modelled on a system that does n't exist anywhere on earth .
He created a hall of mirrors that simply benefits the people who put him in power and other greedy individuals that are so unAmerican that they are not worthy of the phrase anti - American .
With subjects this hard to please , you can see why some leaders might end up losing the plot ."
2011-03-21,"On Thursday 17 March , the Senate approved the House - passed continuing resolution that funds the federal government until 8 April .
This is the sixth short - term continuing resolution ( CR ) since the end of September 2010 , with no end in sight as Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the continuing budget impasse .
"" We look like idiots to the American people , "" says Allen West ( Republican , Florida ) , one of the 54 Tea Party - backed House Republicans who voted against the bill , defying the House speaker John Boehner ( Republican , Ohio ) .
The new CR cuts $ 6bn in federal spending .
But conservative House and Senate Republicans say this is not enough .
They want to pursue another $ 57bn of cuts in this year 's budget , with defunding for healthcare reform , family planning , national broadcasting , endowments for the arts , transportation and education .
Confronted with a mounting challenge from House Republicans , Boehner expressed his frustration : "" Listen I understand that some of our members want to do more , but what is it in this bill they disagree with ?
Nothing .
Nothing .
"" This rebellion is backed by Newt Gingrich , former Republican majority leader , who in a recent Washington Post editorial , urged the GOP "" to stick to its principles "" .
Gingrich is a bad omen for most Republicans , including Tea Party leaders .
In the winter of 1995 and 1996 , thanks to a standoff between Gingrich and President Bill Clinton over budgetary issues , the federal government shut down twice .
Those shutdowns persisted for 26 days in total , a record in the history of the federal government .
Much to their dismay , Republicans ended up being blamed by the public , and Clinton received a major reelection boost .
Understandably , the Republican leadership is traumatised by this memory .
The similarities between 1995 and 2011 are real , and Republicans are right to fear the ghost of 1995 .
According to a recent opinion poll , 46 % of the public thinks the Republicans in Congress would be more responsible for the shutdown than President Obama .
John Boehner does not want to walk into this trap .
Left to his own devices , he would probably work out a compromise with the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , for the rest of the fiscal year 2011 .
Conservative Democrats would have to agree to move the political centre a little bit more to the right .
They could probably live with it , though , as they have done for the past 30 years or so .
Things are different for liberal Democrats , who have to respond to the concerns of public sector workers and ethnic minorities in their districts .
But Conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans could meet somewhere in the middle , around another $ 10bn cuts .
Trouble is , the Tea Party stands in the way .
Confident that they ride on a major anti - government wave that is not going away anytime soon , Tea Party Republicans are not at all interested in compromise with the Democrats .
"" Why would I compromise with a party that 's inept ?
We do n't need to meet half way , "" says Allen West .
House Republicans are being pushed to the right . ""
The addition of new freshmen representatives is having a tremendous impact in the House , "" says Becky Rogness , press secretary for Congresswoman Michele Bachmann ( Republican , Minnesota ) , who founded the Tea Party caucus in the House .
Rogness writes , via email : "" For example , we were looking to save the taxpayers $ 100bn , and initially , what was presented was less than that amount .
So , all of the Tea Party influence , together with the new freshmen , demanded a minimum of $ 100bn in cuts , and that 's the amount that finally was reached . ""
Besides , they believe that the Republican leadership owes them , big time : "" We saved them from the dictatorship of Nancy Pelosi , "" says West .
Some Democrats think that former House majority leader Dick Armey , the other spectre of the 1995 - 1996 shutdowns , is pulling the strings of the Tea Party behind the scenes .
Dick Armey is the chairman of Freedom Works , the product of a merger between Citizens for a Sound Economy ( set up by David Koch , of Koch Companies ) and Empower America .
For Democrats , the Tea Party enables the dark side of the force ( "" activist "" billionaires like the Koch brothers ) to complete the unfinished business of the 1994 conservative revolution . ""
He [ Armey ] has been trying to push the Republican party over to the right for a long time , "" says former Democratic whip and South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn , and now , "" he is now doing it from the outside .
"" In all fairness , the Democrats are on to something here .
As Armey writes in the prologue of Give us Liberty : A Tea Party Manifesto : "" Looking back , the revolution of 1994 was an insider takeover .
Insider jobs like 1994 are an inherently weak strategy because they are too dependent on the good intentions of people astride the levers of power â€ ¦
The Tea Party movement has the power to break the cycle by establishing a constituency standing at the dead centre of American politics . ""
Clearly , Freedom Works has tried to capitalise on the raw energy of the movement , with some success .
But the Tea Party can not be reduced to the likes of Armey and Gingrich .
It is a very broad church , with several contradictions .
That 's why leaders such as Amy Kremer , leader of the American Grassroots Coalition , prefer to stick to fiscal conservatism and constitutionally limited government .
To address issues like gay marriage and entitlement reform is to open a Pandora 's box of longstanding social conservative grievances .
While half of Tea Party constituents object to "" Obamacare "" , gay marriage and family planning , they still want to keep social security and Medicare .
Meanwhile , younger constituents , including some Christian activists , are relaxed about gay rights .
"" Republicans are riding the back of the tiger , "" warns Jim Clyburn , paraphrasing JFK in his 1961 inaugural address ( Kennedy said , "" in the past , those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside "" ) .
It does not take a political genius to figure out that this is precisely what Democrats , including President Obama himself , hope will happen .
"" This weapon will be their own destruction , "" predicts Clyburn .
The majority of Tea Party freshmen , emboldened by their success , want a government shutdown .
Democrats hope this will scare off independents and moderate Republicans for good , precipitating the Tea party into the dustbin of history .
Certainly , Democrats could be right to think that the movement , like a wasp , will sting and die â€ “ though I am not so sure .
But they forget that by moving the political centre further to the right , the Tea Party will have inflicted a major political damage .
Equality and taxation have become dirty words in America : that 's no mean achievement for rightwing populism .

2011-04-03,"The US faces a government shutdown this week as Democrats and Republicans clash over proposals for $ 33bn ( £ 20bn ) in budget cuts .
A weekend of compromise talks appears to have failed .
Barack Obama called the Republican House speaker John Boehner and others urging them to find a resolution , the White House said .
The president warned that a shutdown would be harmful "" to our economic recovery . ""
Boehner has said he is against a shutdown but faces pressure from rightwing Tea Party Republicans who are pushing for $ 61bn in cuts that were agreed in the House last month but rejected by Obama .
Tea Party supporters gathered in Washington last week and chanted "" cut it or shut it "" as Republican Mike Pence told the crowd : "" Let 's go pick a fight . ""
He said a shutdown could be necessary to protect everyone 's "" children and grandchildren . ""
Other Republicans , including Paul Broun , said Obama had orchestrated a plan to shut down the government to make the Republicans look bad .
This week politicians will attempt to broker their seventh stopgap measure in this fiscal year and reach a deal on federal spending for the next six months in order to avert the first government shutdown since 1995 .
Republicans will unveil their budget plan on Tuesday .
The current funding resolution expires at midnight on 8 April and a shutdown could start the day after .
If politicians fail to reach a compromise , Congress could stay in session next weekend , trying to finalise a spending plan and to decide what services would be deemd vital in order to avoid a large - scale disruption .
The extent of the problems that would be caused by a shutdown is unclear .
Federal agencies are currently drafting contingency plans to determine who would keep working but have been told not to disclose details .
While US military operations would be unaffected and essential services such as air traffic control would also be maintained , the processing of visas and other administrative work are likely to be hit , and national parks would be closed .
The picture is complicated by that fact that so many government jobs are now contracted to private enterprises .
This outsourcing means some parts of the government could carry on running during the shutdown .
Uncertainty over pay and contracts , however , is likely to cause extensive disruption .
Spending on government contracts totalled $ 535bn in the 2010 financial year .
If the government cuts off cash to its contractors , the pay of workers may be affected , especially at smaller firms who can not afford to ride out a closure .
Union bosses have warned workers not to assume they will be paid for work done during a shutdown .
Other workers may find they are locked out of their offices .
Government shutdowns are a rare .
The most recent stretched from mid - December 1995 to early January 1996 and was the longest in recent history .
Republican senator Lindsey Graham played down the possibility of a shutdown on Sunday and said a deal could be made with fiscally conservative Democrats .
"" There are enough red - state Democrats "" to get a deal worked out , Graham said on CBS 's Face the Nation .
Last month 85 Democrats joined Republicans to pass the last short - term budget bill to keep the government running through until 8 April .
On Friday , Obama warned lawmakers that it would be the "" height of irresponsibility "" to shut down the government .
"" We know that a compromise is within reach .
And we also know that if these budget negotiations break down , it could shut down the government and jeopardise our economic recovery , "" he said .
His speech came as government figures showed the US unemployment rate is continuing to drop , falling to 8.8 % , the lowest level since March 2009 .
The unemployment rate has dropped 1 % in the last four months , the largest four - month drop since 1984 .
The US stock markets have enjoyed their best first quarter in a dozen years .
Boehner said last week that a shutdown would undermine Republican goals to cut government spending . ""
Let 's all be honest , if you shut the government down , it 'll end up costing more than you save because you interrupt contracts .
There are a lot of problems with the idea of shutting the government .
It is not the goal .
The goal is to cut spending , "" Boehner told a news conference ."
2011-04-04,"Who do you think leaked this to Roll Call ?
: House Republican leaders are privately warning Speaker John Boehner that they may not have the votes to pass a six - month spending bill with significantly less than $ 61 billion in cuts , and they are chafing at his closed - mouth style of negotiating .
Boehner , Senate Democrats and the White House are zeroing in on $ 33 billion in spending cuts .
But the Ohio Republican is finding significant resistance from his top lieutenants , who have repeatedly warned they can not sell that number to rank - and - file Members , insisting on at least $ 40 billion in cuts .
According to sources close to the issue , during a leadership meeting this week Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( Va. ) , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy ( Calif. ) and Republican Conference Chairman Jeb Hensarling ( Texas ) reiterated their concerns with Boehner 's handling of the talks .
According to these sources , Boehner 's fellow leaders are concerned that a smaller deal will not muster the 218 Republican votes needed for passage .
In fact , several sources said that at one point McCarthy bluntly warned they would lose a significant number of GOP votes if the deal is based on $ 33 billion in cuts .
Um , first of all , for the record , the budget wo n't need "" 218 Republican votes "" to pass .
It 'll need 200 votes .
Assuming roughly 90 or so Democrats support it , based on Dem levels of support for the last two continuing resolution , it 'll need about 130 GOPers , or roughly 54 % of the GOP caucus .
That 's not terribly heavy lifting , and it 's why I still think a bill will pass even after all this sturm und drang ( note : could Democrats flee the deal in an attempt to put more pressure on John Boehner to round up the votes from his caucus ?
They could , but they do n't usually play that sort of hardball . ) .
Now before going further , let me say that despite what some of you say about me , I am not sitting at this blog all day concocting Democratic rosy scenario .
If the Democrats are facing disaster , I usually say so .
Just this morning I wrote a post about the ways Obama could lose the next election .
So when I say I think the Republicans may be in for trouble , I 'm not trying to spin .
I actually think it .
They may be in for trouble .
Right now , the $ 33 billion figure is probably seen by most middle - of - the - road people as "" fair "" in that it splits the difference .
The R 's wanted $ 61 billion , the D 's wanted $ 0 billion .
Okay , so 30-something .
Cut a deal and get on with it .
The side that departs from that deal risks trouble .
If the two sides come to an agreement on $ 33 billion in actual cuts ( which has n't happened yet ) , and if that budget vote fails , and if more than half of R 's vote against it , and if the government then shuts down - lots of ifs , but a plausible chain of events - then I think it ought to be pretty easy for the D 's to paint the R 's as a bunch of extremists who walked away from a handshake , and Boehner as a guy who ca n't handle his caucus .
I can hear the newscasts : "" Speaker Boehner had an agreement in principle with Democrats , but it was n't enough for his tea - party members , and he could n't deliver their votes .
And so now we have the spectacle of a budget with the largest cuts in a single year in modern history blocked ... by the Republican Party . ""
And your son 's eighth - grade class coming to Washington ca n't visit the Smithsonian .
Am I wrong here ?
Seems a slam dunk .
Not that the Democrats have n't missed their share of slam dunks .
Speaking of basketball : Connecticut 77 , Butler 71 ."
2011-04-05,"The US federal government faces a shutdown from Saturday after the White House and the Republican - led House failed to reach an agreement on Tuesday on budget spending cuts .
Barack Obama met the House Speaker , John Boehner , at the White House but the two were unable to bridge differences .
Obama , speaking afterwards at a press conference , said the two were closer than ever before over the amount of cuts , but he blamed politics and ideology for the continued differences .
If there is no deal by Friday , the shutdown in federal services will start the following day .
The armed forces and emergency services will not be affected , but there will be disruption to such things as payments to military veterans , passport applications , visits to national parks and monuments and loans to small businesses , Obama said .
The Democrats and Republicans are locked in a battle over last year 's budget .
Obama told the press conference that he had agreed to the $ 33bn ( £ 20bn ) in cuts originally sought by Boehner , but that the speaker was quibbling about the details .
The main disagreement is not over the figure but where the cuts should be made : the Republicans want reductions that would hit both Obama 's healthcare plans and the environmental protection agency .
Obama and Boehner both held press conferences , intent on trying to avoid the blame for a shutdown .
"" The American people do not like these games , "" Obama said , calling on his Republican opponents to behave like grown - ups and reach a compromise .
Boehner said there was no agreement because the $ 33bn cuts proposed by the White House were smoke and mirrors .
"" There was no agreement reached so those conversations will continue , "" Boehner said .
Boehner is under pressure from a new Republican intake in the House who owe their victories to the Tea Party movement which campaigned for deep cuts in federal spending .
Obama offered to hold further meetings on Wednesday and Thursday with Boehner .
It has been 15 years since the last US shutdown , during the Clinton administration .
In a separate development , the Republicans introduced their spending plan for the future , one that would cut the federal deficit by $ 5.8tn over the next decade , compared with the $ 1tn Obama is proposing .
The Republican budget has no chance of being implemented , with Obama in the White House and the Democrats in charge of the Senate .
The Republican cuts would come from healthcare and tax reforms .
•
This article was amended on 6 April 2011 to correct a heading which gave the potential cuts figure as £ 33bn ."
2011-04-08,"America is preparing for a federal government shutdown from Saturday that could see 800,000 staff suspended and hundreds of agencies , from the national parks to the tax office , disrupted or closed .
The fate of the federal government rests on a meeting at the White House between Barack Obama and the Republican House Speaker , John Boehner , aimed at securing a last - minute deal .
The initial impact of a shutdown would be felt by Americans on spring breaks and international tourists , who would find attractions closed on Saturday , such as Washington 's Smithsonian museums , the Statue of Liberty and the former Alcatraz prison , as well as scores of national parks .
Essential services such as air traffic control , border authorities and security services would be maintained as would postal services , but many others would either cease or be severely reduced .
Congress , the Pentagon and many other government agencies would also be affected .
In anticipation of widespread disruption Congress has divided staff into two camps : "" essential "" workers , who would be expected to turn up for work as normal on Monday , and "" non - essential "" staff , who would be told to stay at home .
To be deemed non - essential would be a blow to the morale of many in status - conscious Washington .
In a further indignity , staff face having their BlackBerries and laptops shut down .
There are more than a million federally owned BlackBerries .
Jeffrey Zients , deputy director of the White House 's office of management and budget , said the impact of the shutdown would be uneven . ""
National parks , national forests and the Smithsonian Institution would all be closed .
The National Institutes of Health Clinical Centre will not take new patients , and no new clinical trials will start , "" he said .
Troops stationed overseas , such as in Iraq and Afghanistan , would not receive their wages , but welfare recipients would continue to be paid .
American holidaymakers who have left it late to apply for passports could be in trouble as would foreigners hoping for visas for the US .
There is confusion over whether non - essential staff would be paid after the shutdown for the days they are absent .
The government said they would not be , though after previous shutdowns staff were able to recover lost pay .
Obama , after a late - night meeting at the White House with Boehner and the Senate leader , Harry Reid , sounded optimistic that a deal could be reached .
He said staff from both sides would work through the night to bridge the remaining differences .
"" I am not prepared to express wild optimism , "" the president said .
"" But I think we are further along today than we were yesterday . ""
He is expecting an early answer from the Republicans to prevent the steps necessary to impose a shutdown being put into action .
The Democrats said agreement had been reached on about 70 % of the issues .
A senior Democrat in the House , Steny Hoyer , told NBC "" there 's no deal yet , unfortunately "" .
He said he was embarrassed about the country being on the brink of a shutdown , but "" you ca n't negotiate on the basis that one side gives 100 % and the other gives zero "" .
The Republicans want a cut in the federal deficit of $ 40bn ( Â£24bn ) .
The Democrats made a compromise offer of $ 34.5bn on Wednesday .
The new sticking points are mainly the areas where the Republicans want cuts â€ “ abortion programmes and environmental protection â€ “ on which the Democrats refuse to give way .
Obama has postponed a trip to Indiana , where he planned to make a speech , because of the budget crisis .
He said he wanted to be on hand for any further negotiations ."
2011-04-08,"President Barack Obama expressed hope that a US government shutdown can be averted on Saturday after late - night talks with the Republicans at the White House on Thursday night aimed at agreeing a budget deal .
After meeting the house speaker , John Boehner , a Republican , and the Senate leader , Harry Reid , a Democrat , Obama said the two sides had narrowed their differences and staff would work through the night to try to close a deal .
Obama said : "" I have just completed another meeting with the speaker .
We made some additional progress this evening . ""
He said he expected to announce on Friday that the shutdown had been averted .
But , he added , there remained significant differences .
"" I am not prepared to express wild optimism , "" he said .
"" But I think we are further along today than we were yesterday . ""
With the federal government due to shut down at midnight Friday , Obama said contingency plans would have to be put in motion to begin closing services and so he needed an answer from Boehner early on Friday .
Without a deal , about 800,000 federal staff face being suspended without pay and a range of government services will be withdrawn as hundreds of agencies either continue with a reduced operation or close altogether .
Boehner and Reid issued a joint statement confirming they had narrowed their differences
but they had not yet reached agreement and that their staff would work through the night .
Obama postponed a trip on Friday to Indiana where he planned to make a speech which has been postponed because of the budget crisis .
The president wants to be on hand for any further budget negotiations .
The US Congress has begun sending out letters warning staff they will be suspended from this weekend along with hundreds of thousands of other workers as part of a looming federal government shutdown .
The letters inform staff whether they are regarded as essential – necessary to maintain security and keep Congress running – or non - essential .
The process will be repeated at the White House , the Pentagon and hundreds of federal agencies that are preparing to scale back or cease operation from midnight on Friday .
If no last - minute agreement is reached , the government will begin stopping everything from tourist visits to the Statue of Liberty and Alcatraz to wages for about 800,000 federal employees .
In Washington , libraries will close , there will be no parking attendants and , for one week , no rubbish collection , and the University of the District of Columbia would also be shut .
One of the most emotional issues is that troops in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere would not receive pay cheques until the crisis is resolved .
But they would at least continue earning during any shutdown , unlike civilian employees .
The Republicans want a cut in the federal deficit of $ 40bn ( £ 24bn ) .
The Democrats made a compromise offer of $ 34.5bn on Wednesday .
The new sticking points are mainly the areas where the Republicans want cuts – abortion programmes and environmental protection , on which the Democrats refuse to give way .
Reid , speaking in the Senate early on Thursday , said : "" The numbers are basically there .
But I 'm not nearly as optimistic – and that 's an understatement – as I was 11 hours ago .
The numbers are extremely close .
Our differences are no longer over how much savings we get on government spending . ""
He added : "" The only thing holding up an agreement is an ideology . ""
He said the Republican leadership had drawn a line in the sand over abortion and clean air , issues he said had no place in a budget bill .
But Boehner 's office disputed that there was even agreement on the numbers .
The House , which is controlled by the Republicans , passed a bill that would keep the federal government going for at least another week .
But the Senate , which is Democrat - controlled , will not pass it and Obama said he would veto it anyway .
The Democrats say they are not interested in another stop - gap measure and insist is only a Republican attempt to avoid blame for a shutdown .
As evidence , they say that the bill includes $ 12bn in cuts ."
2011-04-14,"So I was hearing on NPR this morning that some House Republicans are a tad miffed at Paul Ryan , the man who will now lead them , even more than John Boehner , either to Valhalla or maybe off the cliff , for a pro - union vote he cast a month ago .
Here 's a description , from some sort of right - wing web site : The amendment was an effort to end project labor agreements on federal construction projects in 2011 .
This is the sort of thing one would think that every Republican would naturally vote for .
Yet the final vote left the tally standing at a tie which meant the measure failed to pass .
Twenty - six Republicans voted against this good amendment , Ryan being one of them .
Before I get to Ryan 's reason for voting in favor of this union giveaway , we need to explain exactly what a Project Labor Agreement ( PLA ) is .
One of President Obama 's very first moves when he took office was to sign Executive Order number 13502 requiring all federal construction projects to operate under PLAs .
A PLA forces all construction projects to operate under union rules and this means that contractors must pay union pay scales and union benefits even if the companies that get the federal work are non - union shops .
This severely bloats the costs of federal construction projects and unduly lengthens completion times .
Plus it is a boon to unions that get all the benefits while the non - union workers get nothing in return as they are forced to pay union dues even though they will never gain from any union pensions or benefits .
Yes , Ryan voted in favor of this budget busting policy by not voting in favor of Rep. Frank Guinta 's ( R , NH ) amendment to eliminate the PLAs .
Seems odd , right ?
So what the heck happened ?
Ryan explains that it was an "" accident . ""
The Washington Times ' Quinn Hillyer asked Ryan what the heck he thought he was doing ?
Paul Ryan was one of those 26 "" no "" votes .
I asked him why .
Before the question was even half out of my mouth , Ryan said that his vote was just a mistake , and that four or five other GOPers who voted "" no "" made a similar mistake .
He said the amendment was one of a series of dozens of amendments all offered in rapid - fire fashion , with just two minutes to vote on each , and that he had just gotten confused on that vote and thought it was the next amendment in line .
He said he would vote to ban PLAs the next time the subject came up .
Okay , first of all , I love the description of PLAs .
You would n't know from that paragraph that there 's maybe a reason why contractors are required to pay union scales , because of a long history ( and not ancient history ) of their not doing so and because yeah , the federal government should indeed stand for a good wage for working people .
But anyway .
Remember "" read the damn bill "" ?
This was the tea - party alarum in 2009 over the healthcare law .
Unlike those meddling liberals , right - wingers actually read bills .
Oops .
Maybe it was just an accident .
Maybe the pro - union protests raging in Ryan 's state at the time had nothing to do with it .
Interestingly , Ryan 's district is pretty evenly split .
For a guy who 's such a thoroughgoing wingnut , he represents a district that is only R+2 in its partisan voting index , meaning it 's potentially a swing seat .
It 's Democrat Les Aspin 's old district , for you old timers .
It 's fairly blue collar and probably home to not a few schoolteachers and other "" freeloaders . ""
But let 's assume it was an accident .
Even if it were , Republicans would not be mentioning it in the first place to NPR 's Andrea Seabrook if they were feeling serene right now about the position Ryan had put them in .
They 've got to go out and defend the destruction - his planned destruction - of Medicare .
This could well be fun to watch ."
2011-06-16,"Barack Obama has vigorously defended his right to take military action in Libya without the formal approval of Congress , after Republican leaders challenged his authority amid the right 's growing suspicion of costly foreign military operations .
This week the Republican leader of the House of Representatives , John Boehner , wrote to Obama telling him that , under the 1973 war powers act , the president was obliged to seek congressional approval for the Libyan venture before Friday .
The White House replied by saying the law , which says there must be a vote in the legislature within 90 days of the president taking the US to war , did not apply because US participation in the Nato bombing did not amount to full - blown war .
The issue unites liberals opposed to foreign ventures with fiscal conservatives , including some Tea Party supporters who want big cuts in military spending , although other Republicans want defence protected from budgetary restraints .
The dispute is unlikely to have an immediate effect on the US role in Libya , but is becoming a sharp issue as next year 's presidential election draws near , with some members of Congress filing a lawsuit accusing Obama of breaking the law .
Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state , said she was deeply concerned by reports of wide - scale rape in Libya and other acts of sexual violence across the Arab region .
She praised the "" brave women "" of Libya who came forward to tell of brutality at the hands of Gaddafi 's forces .
She urged a thorough investigation and the perpetrators to be brought to justice .
Boehner , the speaker of the House , added to that pressure earlier this week when he wrote to the president to tell him that refusing to comply with a congressional request to seek authorisation for military action in Libya appeared to violate the war powers act . ""
The combination of [ White House ] actions has left many members of Congress , as well as the American people , frustrated by the lack of clarity over the administration 's strategic policies , by a refusal to acknowledge and respect the role of the Congress , and by a refusal to comply with the basic tenets of the War Powers Resolution , "" Boehner said in the letter .
The White House has responded with a 38-page report to members of Congress , describing the Libya operation not as war , but a mission to remove Muammar Gaddafi from power .
The administration says that since Nato took over command of the operation in April , the US role has largely been restricted to supporting military action by Britain , France and others with refuelling and surveillance missions .
But it acknowledges that remote control drones , as deployed in Pakistan and Yemen , are also at times used to fire missiles . ""
US operations do not involve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces , nor do they involve US ground troops , "" the report said .
Boehner dismissed the White House position on Thursday .
"" It does n't pass the straight - face test in my view that we 're not in the midst of hostilities , "" he said .
"" It 's been four weeks since the president has talked to the American people about this mission .
It 's time for the president to outline for the American people why we are there , what the mission is , and what our goals are . ""
The House speaker said that Republican leaders were considering their options including "" the power of the purse "" .
A major concern for the Republicans is the cost , after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to the US 's ballooning deficit .
The White House report says the assault on Libya will have cost the US $ 1.1bn by the time the latest phase of the Nato operation ends in September .
Some more liberal members of Congress say the US has no business intervening in foreign conflicts .
On Wednesday , 10 members of Congress from both parties asked the courts to order Obama to withdraw American forces from the Libya operation .
The author of the lawsuit , Dennis Kucinich , said the White House 's arguments about the degree of involvement did not stand up to scrutiny . ""
Look , we 're at war .
There 's already been $ 750 m spent , "" he said .
"" Whether there are boots on the ground or not does n't really get into the question of whether or not the president had the ability [ to intervene ] in the first place .
It 's a constitutional issue here , and it ca n't be danced around at all . ""
Another member of Congress , California Democrat Lynn Woolsey , accused the administration of showing "" contempt for the constitution "" .
The war powers act was passed in 1973 amid a backlash against abuse of presidential authority during the Vietnam war â€ “ including the secret and illegal bombing of Cambodia â€ “ and over the veto of President Richard Nixon .
It requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of sending the military in to action .
If those forces are to remain in action for more than 90 days , the legislation requires that the president seek the approval of Congress .
It has been ignored by several presidents , and some administrations have questioned its constitutionality .
However , the Obama White House said that it recognises that the law is legal but argues that it does not apply ."
2011-06-18,"So , then , to the major golf event being staged just outside Washington DC today .
And we refer , needless to say , to the summit meeting being held between President Barack Obama and John Boehner , the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives , over 18 holes at the Andrews military base in Maryland .
The political rivals have decided to make up a fourball with VP Joe Biden and Ohio 's Republican governor John Kasich , and intend to whip each other 's ass 10&amp;8 solve the world economic crisis and sort out the mess in Libya as they go round .
We wish them all good luck with those posers , though advise Boehner and Kasich to keep a beady eye on Obama .
This is because sitting US presidents have a reputation for moral turpitude on the golf course .
Richard Nixon , it goes without saying , was a fradulent cheat , shanking balls into impossible thickets only to find them with suspicious regularity .
Lyndon Baines Johnson would wing shot after shot out of play , each and every time simply pretending it had never happened , dropping a second ball and hitting again without saying a word or missing a beat .
Gerald Ford had an unfortunate habit of clattering nearby players upside the head with his ludicrously bad drives .
And Bill Clinton became infamous for his "" Billigans "" - taking a ludicrous number of Mulligans every round - as well as his habit of demanding 50-foot putts be conceded as gimmes .
US Presidents have n't all been bad : JFK had a single - figure handicap before his back caused him too much trouble , FDR was a promising talent before illness took hold , while - and I 'm going to sound like an ignorant pig by saying this , but what the hell - there 's a lot to be admired in the brazen insouciance displayed here by Dubya , who in fairness responded well after putting himself under quite a bit of pressure to cream one away .
So we 're hoping Barack - supposedly a tidy player - does n't need to stoop to any saucy tricks .
But you ca n't be too careful , is all we 're saying .
Also going on nearby is the third day of the US Open at Congressional .
Which is all , of course , about the young genius Rory McIlroy .
You know how we 're set up : he 's six clear of YE Yang , nine clear of the rest of the field , and another sub - par round on a very tricky - and , lest we forget , very typical - US Open track would see him within touching distance of that first major .
There is , of course , the painful memory of that final - day 80 at Augusta , but that 's not why this is far from over :
Yang was six shots behind Tiger Woods at this stage in the 2009 PGA , and he overhauled the leader then to win his first ( and so far only ) major .
The Korean is made of staunch stuff : his par save at 15 yesterday , getting up and down from 100 yards after driving into thick rough , was probably the difference between his halfway total of -5 and finding himself back in the pack .
So , no counting chickens :
we 're only halfway through this US Open , and there will be opportunities aplenty for McIlroy to leak shots all over the place .
Here 's hoping he continues to play his aggressive game , and that his new putting mechanism holds together .
Right , here we go ...
Many of the players are now out on the course - more of this in a minute - but here are the tee times of the final few pairings .
All times BST , just because that 's the way we like it , with my flagrant bias in CAPS : 7 pm :

McIlroy -5
Yang -2
Z Johnson Garcia Garrigus and his comedy kids ' putter Snedeker Kuchar
But there have been some notable moves further down the leaderboard .
Webb Simpson is -5 for the day - he 's carded seven birdies - and is -1 for the tournament .
Harrison Frazar has birdied 1 , 9 and 10 to move to level par .
Bill Haas is -3 for the day and level par for the tournament .
And our silent movie hero Dustin Johnson is -2 through 13 , and + 2 for the tournament .
7.10pm :
An interview with Rory .
He did n't see Hangover II last night as planned : he fell asleep in his room , then had some dinner with Lee Westwood in the evening instead .
"" This is the US Open , the hardest test we have all year .
It has n't seemed like that for me yet , but I 'm sure it will .
"" Difficult to tell whether he looked slightly nervous - he was certainly less bubbly than when he came off the course yesterday - or has simply found his neutral space , a master of serenity .
Let 's hope it 's the latter , but let 's face it , the former is understandable .
Imagine the pressure .
God speed , young man .
7.20pm :
An early birdie for Freddie Jacobson , who is -1 through 3 , and level par for this championship .
He picked up that shot on the 1st , and his opening - hole feat 's been matched by his fellow countryman Johan Edfors , who is now -1 for the tournament .
"" Eisenhower was no slouch at golf , "" reports Eric Armstrong .
"" The one and only hole - in - one of his many years playing came at a small par-3 course at a country club in Rancho Mirage , California .
He was so thrilled he bought a home there and told everyone he loved the course even more than Augusta .
I was told this by an aged relic who lived there .
She said it was painful to watch him launch his inconsistent shots , but she also said he was quick to pay for window repairs . ""
Ha , good on him .
There 's certainly not been such a commitment to golf from the shower of Prime Ministers we 've had over here .
All they ever seem to want to do is sail yachts , read the Bible , or swill whisky until it rolls out of their eye sockets .
Not good enough .
7.30pm :
Webb Simpson is in for a 66 .
Absolutely brilliant .
What any of the chasing pack would give for a round like that today .
What Rory would give for it .
There 's nothing much else going on yet .
A birdie for Bo Van Pelt at 3 does n't exactly stop the presses , though he does move to -1 for the tournament .
Do n't worry , though , it wo n't be long before this all kicks off . ""
Betting line for the Open coverage not posted yet ? "" asks Ed Ed .
"" I refer , of course , to the over / under odds for how many times you use the word ' filth ' and wish Young Rory ' godspeed ' .
If the line for either is 15 I 'll be betting everything I have on the over . ""
How dare you , you cheeky fu ...
oh who am I kidding .
Of course , a journalist blessed with talent and/or dignity would spend the rest of the evening jumping through linguistic hoops to prove you wrong .
But you know exactly what you 're dealing with here , do n't you , you wise man .
Keep a count , it wo n't take long .
7.35pm :
It 's not been much of a US Open for the world number one Luke Donald .
He 's + 1 for the day through 17 , but it wo n't end like that
: he 's just pushed a poor approach through the final green and into the drink behind .
He ends with a double - bogey six , a three - over 74 for the day , + 7 for the tournament .
He 'd got himself up to level par midway through his round yesterday , but the wheels have come clanking off since then .
7.45pm :
McDowell has just hauled himself back to level par for the tournament by draining a 30-footer for eagle on 9 .
Harrington joins him with a birdie on 8 .
Sunghoon Kang has just chipped in for birdie on 16 ; that 's his third in a row and his seventh today .
Sadly , he suffered a triple - bogey 7 on the 5th , so he 's only -3 for the day and + 1 for the championship .
The course is clearly offering up a few chances : hopefully this will encourage McIlroy to come out with a positive mindset .
7.55pm :
A good 16th for Dustin Johnson : he is n't too far from sinking a 60-foot eagle effort , and knocks in the nervy four - footer he leaves himself for birdie .
He 's -3 for the day , and + 1 for the tournament .
8 pm leaderboard : The Masters runner - up Jason Day has carded three birdies in a row , at 6 , 7 and 8 .
Stenson has followed up his birdie at 3 with another at 5 .
The pair are the first two players to make an indent on the upper echelons of the scoreboard .

McIlroy ( 8.50pm ) -5

Kuchar ( 8.20pm ) 8.10pm
: On 3 , the Masters champion Charl Schwartzel knocks in the longest putt of the week , from off the front of the green into the cup near the back .
That 's got to be 60 feet at least , maybe 70 .
That 's Woganesque .
McDowell has just knocked in a very missable ten - footer on the hellish 11th hole to save his par .
He 's still even for the tournament .
Should things go terribly wrong for McIlroy , there will be a lot of suddenly interested players ; this would be some field were it not for the antics of Rory and Yang .
Not long now until the final few pairings go out , and this third day bubbles on a rolling boil .
8.20pm : Edfors has just sunk a 25-foot eagle putt on 6 to move to -1 .
That 's a wonderful response to dropping shots at 2 and 4 .
"" LBJ had a way of dealing with journalists , "" writes Ian Burch .
"" He would often talk to them when he was sitting on the loo .
No doubt he was sinking a few holes in one at the same time . ""
David Frost used to do this to scriptwriters working on That
Was The Week
That Was , if that Harry Thompson biography on Peter Cook is to be believed .
No idea whether the face of 1960s televised satire cheats at golf or not , though .
Not sure what would be worse , either .
8.25pm :
Harrington worked his way up to level par for the tournament , but has bogeyed 10 and 11 to drop back to + 2 .
A terrible short putt missed on 11 , too . ""
An amendment to your tee - time bias , "" suggests Malcolm Jack .
"" Rock should unquestionably read ROCK . ""
You 're right , my fault .
Your man dumps his second into a bunker at the front of the opening hole , but he splashes out to six feet and knocks the par putt into the centre of the cup .
That will hopefully settle any nerves .
Hopefully he 's had a good night 's kip too , after all those visa - and - jetlag - related shenanigans .
Ah , hold on , he 's dumped his tee shot at 2 into a bunker on the left of the green .
A shaky start , then .
8.35pm : Rock has just hit a long bunker shot on 2 to a few inches .
What a brilliant escape .
A shaky start in some respects , but he can take heart that his sand game is in good nick .
Meanwhile Joseph Denson is "" heartened to read the comment from ' CJ ' on the Amazon page for your book on Open chancer Maurice Flitcroft , Phantom of the Open : The World 's Worst Golfer . '
Golfers expecting to learn from this book should avoid . '
In other news , I 've given up on the first Game of Thrones book , I was n't learning nearly enough about the intricacies of swordplay . ""
CJ did n't get where he is today without reading book titles very literally indeed .
8.40pm :
Day birdies 10 to move into a share of third place at -3 with Jacobsen ( who has just birdied 6 , 8 and 9 ) , Stenson ( who 's -3 for the day after birdies at 3 , 5 and 7 ) , and Zach Johnson , who birdies the 1st .
There are certainly scores out here .
Reports , meanwhile , that Sergio has n't bothered warming up on the range today .
Not a single shot !
So here he is teeing off .
And he 's hooked it into deep rough on the left .
Oh Sergio !
How could you !
8.45pm :
Jacobsen is on the move .
He 's alone in third at -4 after rolling in a lovely 15-footer for birdie on 10 .
McDowell 's back in the red , too , after a birdie on 14 .
"" Is being golf 's number one a bit like being women 's tennis number one ? "" asks Gary Naylor .
"" Nobody knows who you are and you do n't win the biggies .
"" There was a feature on Sky yesterday with Luke Donald and Lee Westwood trying their best to convince themselves that it was n't quite up there with winning a major , but
nearly , because - in Donald 's mind - it shows you 've been on your game for two years , rather than four days of any given tournament .
Westwood meanwhile was arguing that it defines your career almost as much as winning one of the big four tournaments .
An insight , perhaps , that reveals why neither of these players have won a major yet .
8.50pm :
Rock is this close to knocking in a 25-foot birdie effort on 3 .
He 's up and running in this round now .
The amateur Russell Henley has birdied 4 , 6 and 8 , to tie for fourth spot in the US Open !
What a way to follow yesterday 's 69 !
Meanwhile , here come Yang and Rory .
God I 'm nervous .
Yang clacks his straight down the middle .
McIlroy 's goes into the first cut on the right , but he 'll be OK .
8.55pm :
Birdies for Garrigus on 1 , and Kuchar on 3 .
They 're both -3 .
This is beginning to hot up already .
There are scores to be had here ; I wonder what Rory 's mindset is .
Well , he 's hit a lovely second to 12 feet on the 1st , despite a less - than - perfect lie .
Yang is n't much further away , but nestled up against the fringe . ""
Is this the first truly Tiger free major ? "" asks Niall Mullen .
"" His shadow was cast over some of the others that he missed but since no - one would expect him to win this week his absence has not been felt .
It means we can all just enjoy the golf , kind of like when England get knocked out of the World Cup and everyone can relax and enjoy the football .
"" I see what you 're saying , but you seem to have accidentally compared the greatest golfer of the last 20 years - and there 's an argument to be made that he 's the greatest athlete of all time - to the shower that is the England football team .
Do you want another go ?
I 'm not sure anybody 's reading .
9 pm leaderboard :
Jacobsen has knocked in a 25-footer on 11 to join Yang in second place .
Yang ca n't immediately jump ahead of him , his birdie putt at 1 staying out on the left .
McIlroy races his birdie putt a good four feet past the hole , but knocks the return in with confidence .
Garcia has bogeyed the 2nd , for God 's sake .
Bye , then , Sergio !
Bye !

9.05pm
: On 2 , Yang pushes his tee shot , a rescue mid , into a bunker on the right of the green .
McIlroy finds the front - left of the green with a 3-iron .
The crowd break into a chorus of "" Let 's go Rory "" .
I say chorus , though that implies some sort of melody .
9.07pm :
Yang does n't have much room to work with : a long bunker shot , but a fast green , and he has to drop the ball right on the fringe .
He fannies the shot , the ball only just getting out of the trap and sitting on the longer cut by the side of the green .
He clips his third a good six feet past the hole .
That 'll be a tester .
9.10pm :
McIlroy is one turn away from holing a 45-foot birdie putt on 2 .
That 's another par , and a very steady start from the young man .
Yang knocks in a very missable bogey putt , dropping back to -4 .
He 's joined there by the amateur Henley , who knocks in his fourth birdie putt of the day on 9 .
9.15pm : McIlroy clanks his drive into a tree down the right of 3 .
The ball drops and nestles in tight rough .
That 'll pose a problem alright .
Yang skelps his drive straight down the middle .
It 's been a good morning for Brandt Jobe
: birdies at 4 and 6 , moving him to a tie of fifth place at -3 .
His compatriot
Bo van Pelt has three birdies of his own - at 3 , 6 and 9 - to tie for 11th at -2 .
9.17pm :
A bogey for Rock at 4 , but he bounces straight back by stroking in a 20-footer on 5 ; he 's level for the round , and -1 . ""
Just comparing them in terms of the dominance they 're given in the coverage , "" digs Niall Mullen , furiously out of his freshly - dug hole .
"" And how their absence allows us to follow other players / teams .
In terms of achievement Tiger won the lot whereas the England team merely ' deserved ' to . ""
Adriot use of the Amazing Shovel of Irony , there , especially with all that soil falling over your head .
9.20pm :
Yang hits a 7-iron approach to the back of the green .
McIlroy elects to chip out sideways , taking his medicine and hoping to knock a wedge very close to save par .
And what a brilliant decision : he hits a crisp third to two feet .
Not even Sergio could miss that putt ; a surefire par .
9.22pm :
No problem for Rory , who saves his par by tokking in that wee putt .
That was a brilliant hole of golf , a sign perhaps that his mind is clear .
Great decision making .
"" England = Sergio , "" writes Professor Gary Naylor .
9.25pm :
A 300-yard drive sent straight down the middle of 4 by McIlroy , the perfect position .
Yang is a little bit behind him , and flirts with the rough on the left , but he 'll be OK .
The Korean does n't look quite as settled as he did yesterday . ""
Woods may not be England , but Rory has thus far been Argentina at the majors , "" suggests Ben Dunn .
"" How they did n't win one of the last two World Cups would be beyond me if I were unaware of the team 's managers .
Though not even Maradona could mismanage this winning position , could he ? ""
This is the US Open .
Anything could happen .
There 'll be no chickens counted on my watch .
9.30pm :
Garrigus responds to a bogey on 3 with birdie on 4 ; he 's back to -3 .
His short putter is ludicrous : the top of the shaft barely comes over his knees .
McIlroy puts a seven iron into sand to the right of the 4th green .
Yang is safely on the green , 25 feet from the pin .
"" I thought Mr Mullen 's meaning was clear enough , "" argues Justin Horton .
"" He was comparing the effect of two absences , not suggesting that the absent entities were themselves comparable .
I think in some ways though , the comparison is n't so apt .
One absence makes things more exciting : the other takes away the hysteria .
One heats things up , the other cools things down .
If you see what I mean .
"" 9.35pm : On 4 , McIlroy hits one of the bunker shots of the week , splashing out to a couple of inches .
On 6 , Kuchar dumps a fairway wood into the lake in front of the green .
Jacobsen moves back to -4 after finding a difficult lie by the edge of a bunker on 13 .
He ca n't hold the ball on the green , and misses the putt coming back .
9.40pm :
Decent approaches to 5 from both Garrigus and Garcia .
Birdie opportunities ahoy , especially for Sergio .
Rock sets about making a hash of 7 , pushing a dismal 9-iron into thick rough on the right , then fluffing a chip .
His second effort leaves him with a six footer for bogey .
9.45pm :
Another magnificent wedge by McIlroy , this time into 5 from 130 yards .
It 's pin high , leaving a 10-foot birdie chance .
Yang , from a perfect spot in the centre of hte fairway , hits it heavy and short ; he 's got a much longer putt for birdie .
Garcia had previously missed his birdie putt .
Does that qualify as news ?
Kuchar has bogeyed 6 ; Rock has missed his bogey putt on 7 .
9.50pm :
Westwood is suddenly in the top ten after back - to - back birdies on 13 and 14 ; he 's -3 for the day , and -2 for the tournament .
Yang two - putts for par , and that poor approach will suddenly hurt , as Rory strokes a nerveless left - to - right tweaker into the centre of the cup .
He 's now -12 for the tournament , and eight ahead of Jacobsen and Yang .
9.55pm :
Kuchar bounces straight back with birdie at the par - three 7th .
He 's -3 again .
A quiet move up the leaderboard by Kyung - tae Kim , who has birdied 3 and 7 :
he 's -3 for the tournament .
"" The English golfers are England ( if we 're going down a route I never intended ) , "" writes the unfairly maligned ( by , er , me )
Niall Mullen .
"" Very high up the world rankings , talking a good game pre - tournament and followed up with underwhelming performances .
Sergio is pre-2008 Spain .
"" Can we be specific ?
How about Spain circa 1982 ?
They were a nervous shambles , and ended up getting their arses handed to them by Northern Ireland .
10 pm : Sergio , with an eagle attempt from the front at 6 , misjudges the swing and putts the ball straight into the fringe to the left of the green .
The ball comes screeching to a shuddering halt .
Dear lord .
He 'll have to settle for par .
Can I downgrade him to El Salvador 1982 , please , Niall ?
Back up the hole , Rory and Yang both wing their drives into thick rough , the former just off the right , the latter hooking way out left .
With water in front of the green , Rory lays up .
Yang makes a similar play , but misses the fairway !
He 's still in the thick stuff , 100 yards from the dancefloor .
Here 's the tipper - toppermost of the leaderboard : -12 McIlroy ( 5 ) -4
Jacobsen
( 15 ) Garrigus
( 6 , he 's just knocked another one in with his toy putter )
Yang ( 5 )
10.05pm :
Yang hits his third 15 - maybe 20 - feet behind the flag .
Not bad from where he was .
McIlroy lands his ball next to Yang 's , but it bites and spins back to six - perhaps eight - feet .
That 's another fine birdie opportunity .
10.07pm :
Yang ca n't make his birdie putt .
It was at least 20 feet , to be fair to him .
He sets it out left , but it does n't break .
Up on 16 , Day rattles in a monster to move to -4 .
And back on 6 , McIlroy misses his birdie chance .
He has the decency to wear a pained expression , but you sense it does n't hurt too much , eight shots ahead as he is .
10.10pm :
McIlroy 's tee shot on 7 , a pin - high 8-iron , 15 feet from the hole .
On 16 , Westwood hits a long iron into the green to 20 feet , a very decent eagle opportunity .
If he sinks that , he 's in second place on his own .
10.14pm :
Westwood sinks his eagle putt , a big left - to - right breaker !
He 's now gone birdie - birdie - birdie - eagle !
He 's -5 for the tournament , and -6 for his round .
This is special .
10.16pm :
Neither Yang nor McIlroy can make their birdie putts on 7 .
McIlroy 's in particular was a tad weak , never a sense that it would make it as far as the hole .
It was dead on line , too . ""
Rory has talent and charisma , but I ca n't help feeling that the reason he garners so much intense support from the notoriously insular American golfing public is that he possesses the invaluable quality of being Not Tiger , "" writes Gary Naylor .
"" Which is understandable to some extent , but Tiger 's hardly the first man , nor first pro golfer , who failed to keep his wood in the bag .
And plenty of others got a free drop .
"" 10.20pm : On 8 , Garrigus finds himself behind a tree to the right of the green .
He bumps his second under the branches and into a bank near the green , a clever shot which nearly sends the ball onto the putting surface .
Sadly , it does n't quite have the legs and falls back into a bunker .
He saves par , though , with a delightful splash from the sand , and a tap - in with his toddler 's putter .
Garcia , his playing partner , taps in for a fuss - free birdie , and moves back to -2 .
10.25pm :
Yang and McIlroy both send their second shots at 7 to within 12 feet .
On 17 , more lovely approaches , Westwood and Jacobsen both find the heart of the green to leave themselves with decent chances for birdie .
Kuchar moves to -4 with another birdie , this time on 9 .
On 16 , Kevin Chappell drains a 30-footer over a ridge for eagle ; he 's -2 .
10.30pm :
Neither Westwood nor Jacobsen make their birdie putts on 17 .
Westwood will have forgotten what it 's like to make a high score like par .
McIlroy knocks his birdie putt straight at the hole on 7 ; about six inches from the cups , his ball makes a ludicrous handbrake turn to the right .
Screeeeech .
That footage should have come with a soundtrack by Euston Films .
I 'm surprised it has n't crashed into a pile of cardboard boxes .
He taps in for par .
10.35pm :
Day rolls in another huge birdie putt , this time on 18 , to move alongside Westwood into second place on -5 .
He 'll sign for a 65 , the joint lowest round of the week .
Day 's a very talented young player , as his second place at Augusta proved . ""
Last time I watched golf , "" begins Colin Coyle , "" I 'd heard how great McIlroy was doing , only to turn it on for the final round to witness a meltdown !
Am I going to jinx him again ?
I 've just started watching from his putt attempt on 7 .
"" You 're OK so far , Colin - he 's just creamed a huge drive down the par - five 9th - but if the wheels come clanking off his wagon , we may have to operate you remotely .
10.37pm :
Brilliance from Sergio .
He 'd hit a wonder drive down 9 , only to push a terrible second into thick dirt down the right .
But he clips a lovely chip up over a bunker and to within three feet .
That should be a birdie , though nothing 's guaranteed with the blade of Garcia .
10.38pm :
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOLFGOD .
Sergio misses the tiddler for birdie , prodding a pathetically meek effort at the hole .
It does n't go in , dying long before it reaches .
Yes , long before , even though it was only a three - footer . "" Does he have an assistant who paints his torso
so it appears he 's wearing a shirt ? "" asks Ed Ed . ""
Imagine if Mickelson did the same .
If you have a strong stomach , I mean .
"" 10.40pm :
Westwood has to make do with par on the last , but he signs for a best - of - week - equalling 65 , and a share of second place with Jason Day .
His playing partner Jacobsen follows him in , carding a 66 , -4 for the tournament .
On 9 , McIlroy knocks his 4-iron second to the back of the green , and it works its way back in towards the hole .
He 'll have a long eagle putt , 20 - 25 feet perhaps .
Yang pulled his second into filth front left of the green , but has splashed out to 15 feet .
10.45pm :
Yang does n't hit his birdie putt , and has to settle for par .
Rory 's eagle effort is never going in either - always going to break left - but he leaves himself a two - foot birdie putt , and he 's back at that magic -13 mark again .
As he leaves the green , he allows himself a small smile and makes a young lad 's day by tossing him his ball . ""
Thank you , "" grins the kid , a sweet moment .
He 'll have to wait a while to play 10 , because Sergio has only just hit his tee shot , and he 's dumped it in the bunker at the back , where trouble awaits .
10.50pm :
Sergio plays a magnificent bunker shot on 10 ; with no green whatsoever to work with , the pin right in his face , he drops the ball on the fringe in front of the trap he 's in , to send the ball trickling onto the green .
He 's given himself a chance .
He 's still left with a 12-foot par effort - or 847 feet in Sergiovision - and misses , need I even bother telling you . ""
If I had one , I 'd put the mortgage on Rory to pick up SPOTY 2011 , "" writes an uncharacteristically reckless Gary Naylor .
"" It 's buying money . ""
Wo n't he be buggered if he actually starts winning stuff , though ?
Not how folk get their kicks round these parts , is it ?
10.55pm
: Rory hits a strong iron into the 10th and sends his ball into a bunker at the back of the green .
He splashes a lovely shot back out , six feet past the pin , but ca n't hole the par putt .
He makes only his second bogey of the tournament so far , and only his third dropped shot .
He 's back at -12 .
11 pm leaderboard : -12
McIlroy ( 10 ) -5
Westwood ( F ) Day ( F ) -4
Jacobsen ( F ) Garrigus ( 10 )
Yang ( 10 ) -3
Jobe ( 13 ) Love III ( 13 ) K Kim ( 11 ) Z Johnson ( 11 ) Snedeker ( 11 ) Kuchar ( 11 )
11.05pm : Garcia sliced his drive at 11 into the crowd on the right .
It hit some poor bugger , then bounced into the water .
To his eternal credit , he takes his time to stop and apologise to the droopy - moustached gent , shakes his hand , and signs a glove for him .
Another nice touch in the heat of battle , especially with everything going so badly at the moment for him .
On Sky , Butch Harmon watches Alvaro Quiros hole out from a bunker on 13
- he moves to -1 - and dance around in the manic , fist - pumping fashion .
The US coaching legend notes sadly how Garcia used to do stuff like that himself , but now looks utterly miserable .
"" I wish someone would light a fire under him , "" he said earlier .
Me too .
I miss Sergio .
Come back , Sergio !
11.10pm :
From the front of the green at 11 , Garcia rolls in a huge par putt .
What a save !
What an escape !
He deserved that luck .
Not a flicker on Sergio 's face , though .
He 's really struggling with this . ""
Come on , give us a smile , just one smile , "" pleads Butch on Sky .
This is very sad to watch .
Meanwhile , that 65 was Westwood 's best round in any major .
"" I 'm sure Rory is delighted that Gary Naylor ( 10.16pm ) offered up his charisma and talent before taking a match to the bonfire , "" writes Nick McDowell , windmilling into view with a brouhaha in mind .
"" Just as likely the reason he garners so much intense support from the notoriously insular ( WTF ? )
American golfing public is that he possesses the invaluable quality of being Not English . ""
To be fair , most of the English prefer the Not English as well .
It 's part of how everyone processes information over here .
Part of , if you will , the country 's unique charm .
Actually , I 'll stop there .
11.15pm : Having sent his drive into rough down the left of 11 - playing it safe , with Dustin - Sergio Creek down the right - Rory powers a 7-iron to 15 feet behind the hole .
"" Rory ! Rory ! "" scream the crowd .
He 's becoming a real favourite , as we 've noted .
The meltdown at Augusta - and the brave way he responded - has probably done him a lot of favours .
Winning the US Open after that nightmare , after all , would be one of the most amazing tales in the history of All Sport .
Long way to go , though .
No chickens counted on this hole - by - hole .
And with good reason : there are a cluster of amazing players waiting at the head of the pack should he stumble .
11.16pm :
But he certainly does n't look like stumbling at the moment !
He strokes a lovely birdie putt into the cup at 11 , a stupendously good read , and a delightful feathery touch .
A real show of emotion as he punches the air twice , before plucking his ball from the hole .
What a way to respond to dropping a shot at 10 : a birdie on the hardest hole on the golf course !
He 's back to -13 .
This is quite a performance .
So far .
Feet on the ground .
11.20pm :
Garrigus clatters a lovely approach to 12 feet on 12 .
Garcia 's shot is dead on line , but short .
It 's just not quite coming together for the Spaniard .
Back on the tee , Rory hoicks a perfect drive straight down the middle .
Yang - who has done nothing whatsoever today - follows suit .
"" Rory for SPOTY ?
"" splutters Simon McMahon .
"" Writing from Scotland , let 's see what Andy ( Murray ) does before anointing anyone .
Finalist in Melbourne , semis in Paris , winner at Queens .
Let 's see what happens at Wimbledon or New York first .
Good luck Rory though .
"" 11.25pm :
On 12 , Garcia ca n't make his long birdie putt , and Garrigus ca n't make his much shorter one .
Both efforts were highly unlucky . ""
Not convinced that Rory cares what I think , "" admits a tearful Gary Naylor . ""
Yanks like(d ) Faldo a lot more than us Brits do . ""
Niall Mullen adds : "" I 'm not English AND not Tiger but the American Golfing Public have no interest in me .
Those insular sonsabitches . ""
11.27pm :
Yang hits his rescue club down the bank to the left of the 12th green .
That 'll be quite the puzzle .
McIlroy is further up the track , and can send a wedge straight at the flag , but he does n't quite judge the length properly , the ball landing a good 20 feet short .
Still , safe in the heart of the green .
Up on 13 , Garrigus and Garcia hit their balls 20 feet past the flag .
Difficult birdie chances back down the hill .
The amateur Russell Henley ends the day with a 71 , even par for the tournament .
11.30pm
Rory 's putt is a difficult one , up a ridge , but he knocks it dead .
For a second it looks like it was going to drop .
Yang knocked his ball up the big hill with his putter to three feet , and strokes in the par putt .
That 's a magic up and down .
11.35pm :
Garrigus knocks his putt down the glacial green and a good ten foot past the hole .
Sergio goes to school on the putt , and tickles a trickler straight into the cup .
A brilliant putt !
And a wonderful birdie .
Still no smile .
Sergio might be having an average day , but he 's still level par today and -2 for the tournament .
Garrigus knocks in a super putt back up the hill to save par . ""
Andy Murray will breeze through the early rounds , come through a five setter against a much lower ranked player before losing easily to one of the three players who are manifestly better than him , "" predicts Niall Mullen , not exactly clambering out on any limbs .
""
Oh , and during Wimbledon his publicist will come up with a Twitter based wheeze in order to make Andy seem ' fun ' or ' human ' . ""
Ca n't we save this abuse of the poor heroic Murray for next week ?
When Wimbledon 's on ?
And I 'm not at work ?
11.40pm
: McIlroy wallops his tee shot at the par - three 13th over the flag , leaving himself a 15-foot birdie chance back down the green .
I wonder if he was watching Garrigus and Garcia ?
Yang 's 6-iron is even better , pin high , six feet to the left of the flag .
That 's a chance for him to get back to level par for the day .
Of the players in the top 20 places , he 's the only one over par .
11.42pm :
Oh dear , Yang ca n't make his birdie putt , sending a weak dribbler on the low side , the ball squirting off to the right of the hole .
That never looked like going in .
Rory 's clack down the hill was a wee bit bold , going four feet past , but he strokes it back into the cup and walks off the green still -13 .
Thirteen under at the US Open .
It really does bear repeating .
"" It 's a bit rich to hear Monty criticise Sergio for not smiling , "" points out Allan Knox , not unfairly .
"" As a fellow dour Scot I was about to write to Alec Salmond to ask him to offer Sergio Scottish nationality . ""
11.45pm : Sergio is playing some comedy nonsense down 14 .
He takes a 3-wood to play it safe , and wings it into thick rough down the left .
His second squirms off into a bunker down the same side of the hole .
Up on the tee , Rory puts his 3-wood straight down the middle .
11.50pm :
Sergio is a genius , of course .
He splashes a long bunker shot to two feet , saving his par .
Rory then hits a 190-yard 7-iron to six feet behind the hole .
That is simply magnificent .
Rory is blessed with phenomenal talent too , needless to say .
"" I love Sergio even more for his not smiling , "" writes Simon McMahon .
"" Why should he ?
To please Sky ?
I hope Murray ( Andy ) remains stony faced all through parading the trophy in front of the blazers at Wimbledon in July .
And in a kilt .
"" I 'd love to see him win it too .
I have no idea why he annoys so many people .
I do n't know what they want from him .
He might not be the best , but he 's the most fascinating player in tennis by a country mile .
Anyway , this is all for next week .
This is golf !
Major championship golf !
11.55pm :
The amateur Patrick Cantlay signs for a 70 ; he 's -1 for the tournament .
Yang finally cards his first birdie of the day , and it 's much deserved , rolling in a straight eight - foot effort after knocking his approach straight at the flag .
McIlroy steps up and taps a clean putt with a smidgen of left - to - right down the green and into the hole .
He 's now -14 , the first man ever to reach that mark in US Open history .
Amazing .
Outstanding .
Sensational .
The scoreboard - the historic scoreboard - at midnight : More Garcia genius .
He 's behind a huge tree down the left of 15 .
So he steers a low iron , with a bit of fade , into the green and straight at the pin .
Which he hits .
The ball ends up about ten feet from the hole .
That 's highly entertaining .
Finally , a smile from our hero - and up on the green , he makes his birdie putt , a gentle prod along the glass - like surface !
Garrigus follows him in for a much less dramatic birdie , to move into second place .
Back down the hole , McIlroy flushes another drive down the fairway , quickly followed by Yang .
Here 's how we stand :
-14 .
FOURTEEN UNDER PAR ! ! !
AT THE US OPEN !
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER !
McIlroy ( 14 ) -5
Westwood ( F ) Day
( F ) Garrigus
( 15 ) Yang ( 14 ) -4
Jacobsen ( F ) Kuchar ( 16 ) -3
Jobe ( 17 ) Love III ( 17 )
K Kim ( 15 ) Garcia ( 15 ) 12.05am :
Yang , for once , is the closest to the pin with his approach , McIlroy only just making it over the bunker on the front - right of the hole .
He 's just through the fringe onto the green , and still has a birdie chance .
12.10am : McIlroy had to send his putter head through the fringe , so that was n't an easy putt from 15 feet , but he knocks it dead for par .
Yang does n't hit his putt - not for the first time today - and passes up his birdie chance from 12 feet .
A poor effort .
"" This is just fantastic to watch , "" writes Adam Hirst .
"" Sometimes a full on battle between top players is great , sometimes a Duel in the Sun is memorable , but you ca n't beat watching a young talent destroy a world - class field . ""
Yes , shades of Tiger in 2000 at Pebble Beach , for sure .
But Tiger went on to seal the deal .
Rory 's not there yet .
After Augusta , nothing is certain , though admittedly the evidence to this point is about as promising as it gets .
Let 's talk tomorrow , eh ?
12.15am :
Garcia and Garrigus both make minor hashes of their second shots into the par - five 16th , the former not connecting well and leaving his ball short , the latter popping his ball in sand .
Back on the tee , Rory creams another beaut , while Yang follows a wee bit behind .
A dropped shot for the veteran Davis Love III on 18 , but he still signs for 70 and a share of 10th spot at -2 .
12.17am :
Garcia knocks his chip from the front of 16 to a couple of inches .
That 'll be a birdie .
This is a great response by Sergio , who looked utterly defeated when he found water on 11 .
But getting away with par there has changed his mood , and he 's playing erratic but enigmatic stuff now .
Garrigus knocks his bunker shot , brilliantly , to four feet - then manages to push his birdie putt right of the hole .
That would have given him sole ownership of second place ; a poor business .
12.20am : On 16 , Yang creams a 270-yard wood pin high , bouncing it into the green , the ball rolling six feet from the pin .
What an eagle chance !
Shot of the day , and shades of Padraig Harrington 's majestic Open - clincher in 2008 .
Rory , way up the track , pulls his approach into a bunker , front left of the green .
12.23am :
McIlroy plays a bold , bold bunker shot at 16 .
The ball threatens to fly way past the pin , but bites on the edge of the green and settles 12 feet from the flag .
That 's a tester for birdie .
Yang meanwhile watches on , dreaming of his eagle .
12.25am :
Rory leaves his putt up on the right , and has to settle for par .
Yang should eagle , but does n't hit his putt true , and it kinks round the lip of the hole on the right .
He taps in for birdie .
He looks gutted , understandably so , though as things stand , he 'll be in the final group again tomorrow .
12.30am
: Rory and Yang hit perfect tee shots straight down the middle at 17 .
Up ahead , Garrigus and Garcia each plonk their shots in the bunker just to the right of the green .
Their balls are right next to each other ; Garcia may well splash out first , even though he 's closer to the pin .
12.35am : Garcia does indeed play out first , and knocks his ball to a couple of feet .
Garrigus is n't too far outside him .
Both save their pars .
Kuchar pars the 18th to sign for a 69 , -4 for the championship .
Back on 17 , McIlroy 's approach threatens to stay up on the top level of the green , where the flag is , but the ball teeters back down towards the front .
He 'll do well to get up and down from there .
Yang sends his ball to the back - left corner of the green .
12.37am :
Huge drives by Garrigus and Garcia down the last .
Back on 17 , Rory 's putt up the green is very strong , leaving him with a testing ten - footer back for his par .
He has n't had a three - putt all week , but this could be the time .
Yang 's long birdie effort flirts with the hole , but dies just in front ; that 's a par .
So can Rory save his par , and his flawless three - putt record ?
12.38am :
Yes he can !
What a nerveless putt , left to right , down a treacherous green !
He remains at that unprecedented mark , -14 . ""
In the spirit of the day and our tournament leader , can I just give a mention to my dad , Rory O'Flaherty at home in Killarney ? "" asks Cathal O'Flaherty .
"" Happy Father 's Day to him , and to all the other fathers out there too .
Oh , and g'wan young McIlroy ; do it for Rorys everywhere ! ""
12.40am : Garcia plonks his approach to 18 in the centre of the green , making sure not to flirt with any water .
Garragus fannies a useless wedge to the front of the green .
In fact , it does n't even make the putting surface .
He 'd hit such a long drive , too ; that should have been simple . ""
See , you say Pebble Beach , but Tiger was already a Golf Legend by then , "" writes Adam Hurst .
"" The real lookeylikey is the 97 Masters when Tiger burned up Augusta in his first visit as a professional .
Commentators had doubted his ability to challenge , saying that the pressure was different as a pro .
Similarly this time , people doubted McIlroy 's bottle to challenge and win after his Augusta collapse .
He 's still going away from them , there is no chance of him messing up from here .
Another Golf Legend will be born this time tomorrow .
"" 12.45am : Yang and McIlroy skelp two lovely drives down 18 .
12.47am :
Garrigus two putts from the very front of the green , the second a testy six - footer , to sign for a 68 .
Garcia follows him in , with a 69 .
Very decent rounds by both men .
12.50am :
Yang is n't happy with his iron into the 18th , turning his back on the ball almost the second he hits it , but it 's not exactly a disaster , ending up in the heart of the green , albeit with little chance of birdie .
McIlroy plays it safe into the centre of the green , perhaps mindful of his visit to the drink yesterday , the ball biting back and leaving him with a 20-foot effort for birdie .
As he walks down towards the green , he 's rewarded for his efforts with a huge reception .
He 's very popular .
"" Let 's go Rory , let 's go Rory . ""
It 's like a Sunday ovation .
What he 'd give for this to be tomorrow , even with that eight - shot lead in his pocket .
12.54am :
Yang knocks his long first putt to three feet , then pops his short second into the cup .
That 's par , a one - under 70 , and he 's alone in second place , at -6 for the tournament .
He 'll be in the final group tomorrow with McIlroy , who takes two putts to sign for his 68 .
He 's -14 , and that 's the lowest 54-hole total of all time .
Well that , dear people , those of you who are still awake on this Sunday morning , is that for the evening .
Rory held it together brilliantly today .
He 's got an eight - shot lead going into the final round , and unless something very strange happens , this time tomorrow he 'll be US Open cha ... ah , but no .
No counting chickens .
Not here .
Please pop back tomorrow to follow the final day ; it 'll be one to remember , a historic event , whatever happens .
Goodnight , but before I go , here are the final standings at the top of the leaderboard at the end of the third round : -14
McIlroy -6
Yang -5
Westwood Day Garrigus -4
Jacobsen Kuchar Garcia -3 K Kim"
2011-07-14,"Bill O'Reilly Bill O'Reilly actually agrees with Republican party leaders John Boehner and Mitch McConnell and with President Obama that the debt ceiling must be raised .
He even gave the current frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination and leader of the congressional tea party caucus , Michelle Bachmann , a hard time for her determination to vote against the ceiling hike and her insistence that all of the afore mentioned are "" wrong , wrong , wrong "" when they say that come August , we will not have enough money to pay our debts .
O'Reilly also agrees with the urgent need , articulated ad nauseum by the GOP , that the deficit must be reduced by imposing savage spending cuts on services to the poor and elderly .
He remains adamantly opposed to any increase in income tax on the wealthiest Americans , however , and therefore was furious with the president for putting the country 's economic wellbeing in jeopardy by insisting that any deficit reduction package would have to include at least some revenue - increasing measures .
O'Reilly discussed this appalling state of affairs Juan Williams who pointed out that raising taxes a few percentage points on millionaires and billionaires will not lead to Armageddon .
O ' Reilly was visibly distressed by this assertion and implored Williams , whom he referred to as a "" crazy leftist "" , to reconsider his position .
Look Juan , there 's only a year and a half left before the election , not even , less than that .
President Obama can just pull back and say you know what , I 'm not going to have any spending income tax increases .
I 'm not !
I 'm going to wait until I 'm reelected .
I 'll put it forward , people can vote yes or no on me and if I 'm reelected then I 'll raise the taxes .
That solves the problem right now
Juan and he does n't do it !
That tees me off !
Williams refused to accept that our deficit problems are solved by not increasing taxes for the super rich and by the end of the segment , the bewildered host was hitting himself on the head with his notepad and seemed close to tears as his pleas for no tax increases on the wealthy fell on deaf ears .
Sean Hannity Sean Hannity is appalled by how the mainstream media are characterising the GOP 's behaviour in the debt ceiling debacle .
He played some clips of liberals calling the GOP "" hostage takers "" and "" suicide bombers "" and saying that the party has become a "" political cult "" whose "" Hezbollah wing "" is in full control .
He noted that even "" so - called conservative "" David Brooks of the New York Times said that "" if responsible republicans do n't take control , independents will conclude that republican fanaticism caused this default , they will conclude that republicans are not fit to govern and they will be right . ""
Hannity discussed the outrageous slander of the Republican Party with democratic strategist Steve Murphy .
You know what I 'm sick and tired of … you do n't like it either
but the left keeps doing it , the left keep doing it !
The left keep attacking viscously , viciously , Sarah Palin , Michele Bachmann !
Here 's the problem , you say it , a couple of other Democrats say it , it does n't get noticed and
it keeps happening .
If a conservative says it they get fired , their advertisers get targeted because liberals say anything , but free speech does n't exist for conservatives in the media any longer .
That 's the problem .
Murphy responded that he did n't think it was helpful to characterise the GOP as "" economic terrorists "" but maintained that it was highly irresponsible of republicans to suddenly decide that the $ 4 trillion deficit reduction they have been insisting is absolutely essential to save the country from economic ruin , is not really necessary after all if it means that their taxes would have to be raised .
The GOP were happy to accept the over $ 3 trillion in spending cuts and entitlement reform proposed by the democrats , but once it became clear that the president wanted to achieve the final portion of the GOP 's $ 4 trillion target by raising revenue through tax increases on the wealthiest Americans and closing some tax loopholes like those enjoyed by hedge fund managers , the negotiations broke down .
Hannity did not agree with Murphy 's assessment and claimed instead that President Obama was engaging in class warfare by demonising the super - rich .
You know when I did n't have anything … listen , I drove $ 300 cars for years .
I worked in construction .
I washed dishes , I waited tables , I tended bar , I was banging nails , I was painting houses
and you know what Doug , I was glad rich people hired me , rich people went out to dinner , if rich people do n't buy yachts , remember the yacht tax ?
If rich people do n't buy planes , remember the demonisation of private planes ?
If rich people do n't go on expensive vacations , guess who 's going to suffer ? !
Well the rich to some degree if they have to forego any luxuries , but Hannity was more concerned about the poor who might be deprived of the opportunity to service them .
Rush Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh was amused by the disbelief in the mainstream media as to what Republicans are trying to achieve by backing down on the deficit cutting measures they themselves had insisted upon as a precondition to raising the debt ceiling .
He was also a little disappointed , however , to learn that the spending cuts may be off the table as that is still a priority for him and in fact he thinks $ 4 trillion is n't nearly enough .
Even the big deal , even this giant , major , really rolling up the sleeves and getting serious about it $ 4 trillion deal .
Come on , that 's over ten years .
We are running an annual deficit of one and half trillion dollars .
Until you amortize it over ten years , then you realise that this big deal that everybody 's talking about , this really tough , I mean , man , unprecedented big deal would be $ 400 billion a year in cuts .
We ought to be insisting on $ 1 trillion a year in cuts if we 're serious about this , and a lot of people are .
Referring to voters , I am .
A lot of people are very serious , $ 400 billion a year does n't sound like much , does it , when you 've got a deficit of one and a half trillion ! ""
So unlike many congressional Republicans , Limbaugh still thinks it 's important for the US to get its fiscal house in order
and he is still very willing for other people to endure the pain that the draconian spending cuts he is proposing would inflict .
For now , however , it seems that even the $ 4 trillion deal ( modest by Limbaugh 's standards ) is not going to happen .
Instead Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell has come up with a rather complex proposal that would allow the president to raise the debt ceiling in three stages by the end of 2012 , with congress reserving the right to vote against each increase knowing the president can veto their disapproval .
This rather unusual plan has the political advantage of including the face saving measure of allowing Republicans to vote against a measure they secretly know must be passed .
Limbaugh thinks , however , that now that Obama has stolen the Republicans ' deficit - cutting thunder by being willing to make more cuts than the deficit hawks can stomach ; the best option for Republicans being to just vote no and let the president ( and the country ) take the hit .
The dirty little secret here is the Republicans do n't have to seek any kind of deal with the Democrats .
They can sit back and they can do nothing except vote "" no "" on raising the debt ceiling .
They do n't have to .
They do n't have to seek any kind of deal with the Democrats .
It is Obama and the Democrats that are gon na have to figure out how to prioritise payments so the interest on our debt gets paid , but that 's their problem .
We do n't have to do anything .
Limbaugh acknowledges that this might be a hard sell but it would certainly teach us all a lesson that under no circumstances are wealthy Americans to be threatened with tax increases ."
2011-07-24,"Democrats and Republicans are locked into a dangerous game of seeing who will crack first over the national debt crisis , with the White House warning that the next few days could be stressful for world markets and Americans .
With time running out , congressional leaders from both sides met on Saturday after the dramatic collapse of negotiations between Barack Obama and the house Republican leader , John Boehner , on Friday .
But the congressional talks broke up late on Saturday night after failing to make progress .
The White House chief of staff , Bill Daley , interviewed on Sunday on CBS , predicted that the next few days will be tense . ""
In the end , we may have a few stressful days coming up â€ “ stressful for the markets of the world and the American people . ""
In an effort to reassure markets reopening after the weekend , he claimed he was confident a deal would be reached before the 2 August deadline .
The White House refused to discuss what contingency planning is taking place in the event no compromise .
Obama met the Democratic leader in the House , Nancy Pelosi , and the Democratic leader in the Senate , Harry Reid , at the White House on Sunday to discuss possible compromises with the Republicans but a White House staffer said afterwards no deal had been reached yet .
Obama is no longer directly involved in the negotiations following the sudden deterioration in his relationship with Boehner , who , in a breach of Washington etiquette , refused to return the president 's phone callson Friday .
But Obama will remain engaged behind the scenes , and has left his diary for Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday virtually clear .
The Republicans and Democrats have been trying to ensure the other will be blamed by voters if it all goes wrong .
The Republicans accused Obama , when a deal was close on Thursday night , of adding extra bits , in particular tax rises .
Democrats blame a hard core of Republicans in the house elected last year with Tea Party support .
The Democratic leader in the Senate , Harry Reid , labelled the Republicans as intransigent . ""
Their unwillingness to compromise is pushing us to the brink of a default on the full faith and credit of the United States , "" he said .
The business secretary , Vince Cable , broke the unwritten rule of non - intervention in other countries ' domestic disputes on Sunday by describing diehard Republicans as "" nutters "" .
Cable , appearing on the BBC 's Andrew Marr show , said : "" The irony of the situation at the moment , with markets opening tomorrow morning , is that the biggest threat to the world financial system comes from a few rightwing nutters in the American Congress rather than the eurozone . ""
Until now , market traders had appeared confident that agreement would eventually be reached but US legislators fear that , following the collapse of talks on Friday , there could be the first signs of panic when Wall Street opens on Monday as well as other markets round the world .
According to the US treasury , America has to raise its $ 14.3tn ( Â£8.77tn ) debt ceiling by 2 August or risk defaulting for the first time .
Economists warn a default will have a catastrophic impact worldwide .
The treasury secretary , Tim Geithner , attempted to calm the markets by insisting the debt ceiling will be raised , telling ABC News that it was unthinkable that there would be a time when the US could not pay its bills .
Geithner said that congressional leaders were working on a compromise package on Sunday to try to forestall any panic .
But Boehner , in a Fox News interview , did not indicate that a compromise was near and instead blamed Obama .
"" I know the president 's worried about his next election .
But my God , should n't we be worried about the country ? ""
He said he planned to announce details of legislation on Sunday based on a Republican plan that would provide a short - term solution .
Democrats are unlikely to support it .
The White House countered that it was not interested in a short - term solution but wanted a "" grand bargain "" , a 10-year plan for reducing the country 's burgeoning debt by cutting spending and raising taxes .
Daley said that a short - term fix would fail to reassure the markets because the business world is looking for evidence that America is going to take long - term measures to reduce its debt .
Obama and Boehner were close to a deal on Thursday night that would have cut spending by $ 3tn , mainly through spending cuts but also through $ 800bn in tax rises .
Boehner claims that Obama , in an act of bad faith , tried at the last minute to add $ 400bn in tax rises and so he walked away .
The Democrats claim Boehner walked away because he could not sell the package to Tea Party Republicans opposed to any tax rises ."
2011-07-26,"Over the past week , Barack Obama has increasingly let his frustration with House speaker John Boehner , his main negotiating partner in the debt ceiling debate , show in front of the cameras .
In a press conference after their debt limit talks broke down , the president said : "" It is hard to understand why speaker Boehner would walk away from this kind of deal . ""
Yet that may underestimate the scale of Boehner 's task , as Obama himself tacitly acknowledged when he said during his televised address to the nation "" a significant number of Republicans in Congress are insisting on a cuts - only approach "" .
Ultimately , no extension of the debt ceiling can go anywhere without passing the House .
And to pass the House , Boehner must be able to sell any deal to his Tea Party - infused Republican caucus .
Many House Republicans do n't want to raise the debt ceiling at all Boehner is faced with the fact that as many as 40 - 50 of his members oppose a debt ceiling increase on principle .
Many of them believe default can be avoided by other means .
Others simply do n't want to cast their votes for more government borrowing .
In getting a deal passed , Boehner has to proceed without their votes , making everyone else 's vote all the more important .
In addition to those who would never vote to raise the debt ceiling , there are many others who would prefer not to .
For them , it is n't about finding a compromise that will allow them to support a higher debt limit .
Voting for a higher debt limit is the compromise .
Many freshmen think they were elected to reverse government debt In his speech , Obama noted that raising the debt ceiling had become a routine matter .
He cited statistics showing it was extended 18 times under Ronald Reagan and seven times under George W Bush .
But to the Tea Party freshmen , that 's exactly the problem .
A higher debt ceiling has become routine , with each Congress smashing through the permissible debt levels set by the previous one .
They believe that by either rejecting an increase or pairing it with commensurate spending cuts is the only way to reverse this troubling trend .
Most House Republicans have taken a pledge not to raise taxes Obama may want more revenues on the table , but most Republicans ruled that out even before they won their elections .
Higher marginal tax rates at any income level simply can not pass the House .
The votes are not there .
Moreover , the taxpayer protection pledge demands that Republicans swear off closing tax loopholes unless they are matched dollar - for - dollar by offsetting rate cuts .
That means even clever ways of finding revenue by broadening the tax base are difficult to accomplish .
Even conservatives like Senator Tom Coburn have failed to gain much traction when arguing otherwise .
A deal relying mainly on Democratic votes is probably not on First of all , it is n't clear that Nancy Pelosi 's caucus would want to bail out Boehner in this fashion , even if they could .
Secondly , Boehner 's speakership would be imperiled by such a deal .
House majority leader Eric Cantor , who has showed signs he might want to try out that speaker 's gavel , would surely rally the GOP troops against it .
When you consider all these factors , one thing becomes clear .
Obama may be frustrated , but it is Boehner who truly has the tougher task ."
2011-07-27,"The US Congress remained deadlocked over the debt crisis on Wednesday with Republicans in the House of Representatives unable to muster the votes needed to pass emergency legislation ahead of the deadline of Tuesday 2 August .
House leader , John Boehner , faced with a revolt by hardline members of his own party , was having to hastily rewrite a bill he proposed earlier in the week to cut $ 3tn ( Â£1.8tn ) in federal government spending .
He is hoping to put his new bill to the vote on Thursday after being forced to cancel a planned vote on Wednesday because of lack of numbers .
The deepening internal divisions within Republican ranks add another layer to the uncertainty in Washington .
Democratic and Republican leaders have so far been unable to reach any agreement on a deal to prevent America joining Ecuador , Ukraine and a handful of other countries that have defaulted in the last decade .
Although the US treasury may be able to conjure up a short - term solution to prevent default on Tuesday , the row and the failure of the US to tackle its burgeoning debt problem could lose the US its triple - A credit rating , which would have damaging consequences for the country 's economy .
Boehner needs to secure 217 votes to get his bill through , a job made more difficult by a report by the congressional budget office on Tuesday night that said his proposal would only reduce the deficit initially by $ 850bn , not $ 1.2tn as he had claimed .
Hardline conservatives are demanding bigger cuts .
Even if the bill was passed , the Democratic Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , promised the upper house would kill it and Barack Obama said he would veto it .
A solution is likeliest to come from negotiations between Reid and the Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell .
Reid is proposing raising the debt ceiling from $ 14.3tn until after the 2012 presidential elections in return for spending cuts of $ 1.7tn ."
2011-07-27,"Debtgeddon is coming .
President Barack Obama and John Boehner , the Republican Congress speaker , are divided over the US debt crisis .
On 2 August it is D - day â€ “ when the US government will no longer be able to pay its bills within its debt ceiling .
The debt ceiling is like a self - imposed credit card limit for the government .
Under the constitution , federal government borrowing ( and so raising the ceiling ) must be approved by Congress .
In the past , it has increased the debt ceiling without fuss .
Now it stands at $ 14.3 trillion ( Â£8.9tn ) and there is rather more fuss .
Republicans want drastic spending cuts in return for a rise in the ceiling , Tea Party hardliners are demanding no increase at all , while Democrats are anxious to protect welfare and healthcare for the poor .
This $ 14.3tn is the largest government debt in the world .
It got so high because of war , George Bush 's tax cuts , the cost of healthcare and Obama 's Keynesian - style deficit spending , which propped up the US economy after the global banking meltdown .
As a proportion of GDP , the US debt stands at 95 % , below other economies including Japan ( 244 % ) , Greece ( 161 % ) and Italy ( 113 % ) .
( Britain 's is 61.9 % or a scarier 148.9 % if you include financial sector interventions such as the RBS rescue . )
If Congress wo n't approve raising the debt ceiling , the government will default on debts soon after 2 August .
Economists say the consequences would be globally catastrophic : financial markets would take fright , interest rates would soar , the dollar would slump and banks would call in loans , creating a second credit crunch .
The crisis could be averted with a stop - gap measure â€ “ a temporary rise in the ceiling until the politicians reach a permanent agreement , invariably containing big spending cuts .
Whatever happens , the impasse has spooked creditors so much that the US might well lose its AAA credit rating , making it more expensive for the government to service its debt .
No wonder Boehner and Obama are looking so glum .

2011-07-28,"The US debt crisis worsened on Thursday when a proposed Congressional vote exposed the extent of divisions within the Republican party .
The Republican leader in the House , John Boehner , highlighted the extent of the chaos that was engulfing Washington when he scheduled a vote for 6 pm ( Eastern Time ) on a new bill .
The proposed legislation would raise the $ 14.3tn ( £ 8.7tn ) debt ceiling in return for billions of dollars in spending cuts .
But the House Speaker met fierce resistance from hardline Republican conservatives who demanded even more spending cuts .
To the embarrassment of Boehner , he had to postpone the vote for hours as he tried to round up enough Republicans to pass his bill .
The chaotic scenes in the House added to a sense that the chances of securing a compromise on debt ahead of the 2 August deadline were diminishing , with Republican conservatives , backed by the Tea Party movement , becoming more entrenched .
With time running out , the White House is beginning to make emergency plans for 2 August to avoid the US defaulting on its borrowing for the first time in its history , a move that could throw the US and world economy into turmoil .
Earlier in the day , the White House said that it would veto Boehner 's bill .
Democrats , who control the Senate , said they too would kill it .
The White House spokesman , Jay Carney , told a press conference that the bill would be "" dead on arrival "" at the Senate .
Fifty one Democratic members of the Senate , a majority , published a letter pledging to vote against the House bill .
Democrats in the Senate are meanwhile preparing a bill of their own , but the chances are Republicans in the House would vote that down too .
Global markets , initially sanguine about the crisis and confident of an eventual compromise , were increasingly jittery .
There were early market falls but US stocks gained and the dollar rose during the day , buoyed by unexpectedly good unemployment figures .
The Democratic leader in the Senate , Harry Reid , warned : "" Default will rock our financial system to its core . ""
He expressed hope that there could still be a deal . ""
Magic things can happen here in Congress in a very short period of time under the right circumstances , "" he said .
The White House also expressed optimism a compromise could be reached .
Negotiations are continuing in private between the White House and senior Republicans and Democrats on a possible short - term emergency deal .
But Carney admitted that , in the event there is no deal , the treasury would explain its plans in detail before 2 August .
Carney said : "" As we get closer to that date , the treasury will explain how it will manage a situation that is impossible . ""
He acknowledged for the first time that the uncertainty was already causing harm to the US economy .
The White House will almost certainly make its priority paying interest on its debts , so that the US does not default for the first time in its history .
But the consequence could be delaying monthly payments to federal workers , soldiers and other employees , and also millions of cheques to social security recipients , veterans and others .
The treasury said it would release details in the coming days regarding which payments would take priority over others .
It makes an average of 80 m payments a month .
It also said it would go ahead with its regular weekly auction of three - month and six - month treasury bills on Monday – a day before the deadline .
The money raised from that auction will go towards redeeming $ 87 m in securities that will mature on 4 August .
The treasury said that operation would not breach the current borrowing limit .
Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner has said that , after Tuesday , he will have exhausted all the manoeuvres he can use to clear room under the current $ 14.3tn borrowing limit .
The government reached its borrowing limit in May.
The US needs to borrow $ 125bn in new debt each month , in addition to $ 500bn in maturing debt that it must refinance each month .
The debt debate is creating bitter divisions inside the Republican party , between the newer members of Congress elected last November with the support of the Tea Party movement , which campaigned for deep spending cuts , and older members used to reaching compromises with their Democratic counterparts .
Senator John McCain , the party 's presidential candidate against Obama in 2008 , labelled as "" bizarro "" the hardline colleagues in the House who had been in Congress for only seven months .
But one of the hardliners , Congressman Joe Walsh , who is aligned with the Tea Party movement , hit back that McCain had "" been in this town too long "" and had helped get the US into the mess .
In the Senate , another conservative , Jim DeMint , who is closely allied to the Tea Party movement , warned that he would filibuster any Senate bill that offered only a short - term solution without significant spending cuts .
A White House adviser , David Plouffe , in an interview with MSNBC , suggested one way out of the impasse would be to amalgamate the House and Senate bills .
"" What you 're going to have to do is reconcile what 's in Reid and Boehner , which is a lot of the things the president has talked about in terms of spending cuts he 'd be willing to accept .
And that 's where the compromise is , "" Plouffe said ."
2011-07-29,"Hopes of the US debt crisis being resolved soon began to recede on Thursday night when the Republicans humiliatingly failed to get even their own bill through the House , exposing deep divisions within their own party .
The Republican leader in the house , John Boehner , had to abandon the attempt on Thursday night after failing to persuade enough hardline conservatives to support his bill .
He may try again on Friday .
The incident demonstrated the power of these hardline conservatives , many of them elected last November with the backing of the Tea Party movement .
The vote fiasco added to the sense of chaos and confusion as time was running out for a deal to resolve the debt crisis .
With Boehner unable to control his own members , the chances of compromise with the Democrats could be harder to achieve .

Boehner scheduled a vote for 6 pm in the evening on a new bill .
To the embarrassment of Boehner , he had to postpone the vote for hours as he tried to persuade enough Republicans to pass his bill .
Eventually , at 10 pm , the house majority Kevin McCarthy told reporters that the vote had been abandoned for the night .

2011-07-29,"When speaker John Boehner took the gavel from House minority leader Nancy Pelosi in January , Republicans cheered a new era in Washington , inaugurated by an all - out assault on women 's reproductive rights , the administration 's signature healthcare bill and a series of negotiations intended to bring government spending to heel .
But though the speaker sets the agenda , he quite clearly took his cues from a boisterous set of backseat drivers : his new Tea Party members .
Fast forward to July , and the dewy - eyed freshman class ( and their more tenured conservative coattail - riding colleagues ) are threatening to take the wheel from Boehner altogether , over what they view as his stubborn willingness to compromise one iota with the administration over raising the debt ceiling to avoid a default by the US government .
And while President Obama took to the air to encourage his supporters to tweet their support for compromise ( and swamp Capitol Hill with calls and emails for the second day this week ) , Boehner and his consigliere , House majority leader Eric Cantor , were trying to find some way to keep their own members from jumping ship and voting no on their ( relatively ) grown - up bill to stave off the debt crisis by giving the Senate something it has any chance of passing .
But it was n't always this way .
Less than a decade ago , in the wake of the compounding infidelity scandals that rocked the then House leadership during the time of then President Clinton 's impeachment , former high school wrestling coach Denny Hastert held the speaker 's gavel and his consigliere , majority whip - cum - leader Tom "" The Hammer "" DeLay , ruled votes with an iron fist .
Did n't like a bill ?
Delay did n't care â€
“
it was your job to vote for the leadership 's legislation .
Have a Dick Armey - led group threatening you with a primary opponent ?
DeLay was scarier : he 'd set up your primary opponents , kill your earmarks , yank your chairmanship and even , in a case for which he was eventually censured , go after your family .
He had no need to kowtow to some upstart ultra - conservative group , because he made sure they knew who was boss from the outset ( and , frankly , you could hardly get more conservative than DeLay ) .
Boehner 's willingness to let his freshmen members have sway , lest they complain about his forceful leadership style , set up the situation in which we find ourselves today : a small contingent of intransigent ultra - conservatives who care little about the real - world ramifications of a debt crisis and a great deal about ideology and personal brand are holding their own leadership â€ “ and the country â€ “ hostage to a plan of spending cuts few people actually thinks is desirable or sustainable .
Meanwhile , former speaker Nancy Pelosi , whose forceful leadership style made her the first speaker to lose control of the chamber yet keep her preeminent position within her caucus , has managed to hold almost all her own members firm against the bill as well â€ “ something she often had trouble doing as speaker , given some of her conservative members .
Boehner has built his brand within the party around being willing to zing the president and being unwilling to be seen as working with him , which was politically convenient when there was n't an actual problem at hand .
But policy problems require political compromise to solve , and compromising with the administration is something he 's allowed the Tea Partiers and his own political posturing to make untenable .
With some calling for his head within his own party , the Democrats standing firm against the bill he considers a compromise and , now , the clock running out , speaker Boehner may end up the poster child for all that Americans consider broken in Washington â€ “ just in time for voters to choose new House members and who they want in the White House ."

2011-08-05,"Faced with the choice between postponing their summer barbecues and ending the impasse at the Federal Aviation Administration , federal lawmakers punted .
Again .
Senate majority leader Harry Reid reached an agreement with Speaker John Boehner to put the FAA back in business by using a parliamentary maneuvre known as "" unanimous consent "" to pass a stopgap funding measure .
But , like the pact to end the debt crisis , the FAA deal merely buys time for lawmakers to resume their partisan showboating after the recess and resolves exactly none of the root causes of the partial FAA shutdown .
The FAA debacle has its origins in a classic , if obscure , inside the Beltway drama .
The agency had been without a reauthorisation bill since 2007 and operated on a series of funding extensions – 20 , to be exact .
The Republican majority in the House had passed another extension with provisions that the Democratic leaders in the Senate opposed .
The Republicans got the Democrats ' attention by voting to cut $ 16 m in subsidies to 13 rural airports .
Ending payouts to little - used airports seems reasonable .
But Republicans decided to tweak the noses of Reid and his two top lieutenants , Jay Rockefeller and Max Baucus , by targeting facilities in their respective home states , Nevada , West Virginia and Montana .
Senate leaders blasted the ploy as cover for the GOP 's real target : unions .
The Republicans also objected to a provision that would facilitate union organising for airline employees .
Under an Obama administration - backed National Mediation Board change , airline employees would be able to form a union if a simple majority of the people who showed up voted "" yes "" .
Republicans want to preserve a rule that allowed people who failed to vote on a unionisation proposal to be counted , in effect , as "" no "" voters .
The Senate refused to go along with this – and recessed without voting on the extension , putting the agency 's ATM out of service .
Although the debt crisis dealt in "" what ifs "" that few people could process , the FAA impasse produced immediate , real - world problems .
The federal government was on track to forfeit more than $ 1bn in taxes on airline tickets if the dispute continued past Labor Day .
Nonessential FAA employees on furlough complained of their hardships .
Federal contractors scrambled to stay in business .
Air traffic controllers and other safety professionals remained on the job , some working without pay , leaving some state officials concerned by delays to safety and infrastructure improvement projects , especially in areas with short construction seasons .
"" We are frustrated and I know that airport operators and secretaries [ of transportation ] around the country were frustrated as well , "" Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation Jeffrey Mullan said , shortly before the deal was announced .
The temporary compromise allows most lawmakers to enjoy a guilt - free vacation .
The agency secures funding to resume normal operations through 16 September .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood gains the power to hand out waivers to those rural airports affected by cutbacks , but the background labour issue is still up in the air .
Will Democrats be spoiling for another major confrontation over the FAA , come mid September ?
Still licking their wounds from the debt fight , Democrats may yet be encouraged by their pushback in the FAA showdown .
Surprisingly , one key Republican has already backed off : Rep John Mica , the House transportation committee chairman , claimed his gambit was "" just a tool to motivate some action "" .
But he clearly did n't anticipate that Senate Democrats would find their collective backbone .
The next tussle over the FAA , though , is more likely to follow a pattern that 's well - entrenched on Capitol Hill .
The Republicans vow to zap "" waste "" wherever it rears its ugly head and the Democrats cave and try to salvage what they can .
Meanwhile , President Obama still preaches the gospel of bipartisanship to a flock of legislators who are obsessed with inflicting the maximum possible political carnage on each other .
The cage match in Congress resumes just days before the 10th anniversary of 11 September 2001 .
If that occasion does n't force Washington to focus on reasonable solutions to critical issues affecting American aviation , nothing will ."
2011-09-22,"The Republican leadership in Congress is rushing to redraw its budget plans , after a conservative revolt sparked the defeat of a crucial spending bill giving aid to disaster victims and funding the government 's operations past the end of the month .
Unless a continuing resolution maintaining the flow of funds is passed before 30 September , the federal government will be forced to shut down â€
“ a crisis that was barely averted in April with just hours remaining .
John Boehner , the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives , told a press conference on Thursday : "" Listen , there 's no threat of a government shutdown . ""
But Boehner 's breezy confidence was not matched by some of his colleagues , especially those on the right of the party , with 48 Republican representatives joining with their Democratic rivals to defeat the continuing resolution on Wednesday .
While many of the 48 Republican rebels voted against the bill because of its increased spending implications , they were joined by Democrats opposed to the bill 's $ 1.5bn in cuts from a programme to boost production of fuel - efficient vehicles .
Now the House Republican leadership is faced with either winning over Democrats by reducing the cuts or making further cuts to placate hardline Republicans and risk the bill being blocked in the Senate .
The vote is not the first time Boehner 's plans have been derailed by the right of his party , and shows the difficult balancing act he has to perform .
Mindful of how the government shutdowns in the mid-1990s ended up boosting Bill Clinton 's re - election , Republicans are wary of giving the Obama administration a similar gift .
The defeat has the makings of a PR disaster for Republicans , since the bill also provided desperately - needed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which says it has only a few days ' worth of aid remaining for the victims of Hurricane Irene , the Texas wildfires and recent flooding . ""
Never before has Congress decided to nickel and dime those in disasters .
That 's what Republicans are doing today , shortchanging those in areas who can least afford partisan gridlock , "" said Harry Reid , the Democratic party 's Senate majority leader .
Boehner dismissed concerns that the continuing resolution would not be passed in time , saying : Trying to get 535 people to come to an agreement on anything around here is difficult .
But we knew that going in .
We 're working our way through this .
I 've always been confident we 'll be able to come to an agreement ."
2011-11-22,"On Monday night , the debt committee failed in its task to find a solution to America 's debt crisis .
Democrats and Republicans share blame for this debacle .
However , in offering revenue increases far below the realistic compromises offered by House speaker John Boehner in his August negotiations with President Obama , Republicans bear a heavy burden of responsibility .
In the end , supercommittee Republicans put an anti - revenue orthodoxy before the interests of the country .
Now , unless a bipartisan deal can be reached by the end of next year ( an even greater challenge during an election year ) , the US military will face automatic and catastrophic cuts .
In their unwillingness to engage in a pragmatic compromise , supercommittee Republicans have seriously jeopardised the national security foundations on which the Republican party has long resided .
What Republicans did – or did not do – on Monday night was dangerous , illogical and , in the context of ongoing foreign combat deployments , immoral .
I am a Republican .
A major part of my attachment to the party stems from its traditional support of a well - equipped and effective military .
After 9/11 , I often took comfort that our deployed personnel generally had the support that they needed to do their jobs .
Amid the looming cuts , those years seem very distant today .
While President Obama has already announced around $ 450bn in cuts to military spending over the next decade , these reductions represent a balance ( albeit imperfect ) between lowering the fiscal deficit and avoiding substantially weakened US military capabilities .
But by inviting , via their intransigence , $ 500bn dollars of additional ten - year cuts to the military , supercommittee Republicans appear to have effected an overnight party conversion from foreign policy realism to strategic idiocy .
While there are notable Republicans who have been honest about the need and practicalities necessary to protect military spending , so far , their numbers are insufficient .
There can be no question that combined together , the effect of the cuts will be disastrous for the US military .
Defense Secretary Panetta has suggested that if the cuts proceed , military procurement would be gutted to such an extent that America would have its "" smallest ground force since 1940 , the smallest number of ships since 1915 , and the smallest air force in its history "" .
The US Military leadership have echoed this assessment .
The head of the US Army , General Odierno , has stated that the cuts would "" almost eliminate our modernisations programs "" , while US Marine head , General Amos , noted that the cuts would potentially lead to "" a Marine Corps below the end strength that 's necessary to support even one major contingency "" .
All this risk , in a decade that will likely see the continuing rapid growth of the Chinese military , continuing instability in the Middle East and South Asia , alongside the need to rebuild a force strained by years of war .
It is crazy that the prospective benefit for these cuts is the avoidance of revenue reforms that would ask some to pay a little more and others simply to pay what they are supposed to be paying already .
How can our party with a straight face ask young men and women to deploy on multiple combat tours and then reward that service and sacrifice with the message that it is more important to honor Grover Norquist 's pledge than it is to support them ?
This is the opposite of what it is to be a Republican .
Beyond the impact of the cuts on the US military , the impact of the cuts on the credibility of the Republican party will also be profound .
Over the past ten years , Republicans have often rightly opposed those who have mixed absolutely justifiable anti - war attitudes with unjustified attacks on non - political military officers doing difficult jobs .
Whatever one thinks of the politician or the war ( and they should feel free to air those opinions robustly ) , military personnel deserve the respect and the backing , when deployed under orders , that they need in order to do their jobs effectively .
Now to strip our servicemen and women of the tools they need to do their jobs is the ultimate insult and the height of hypocrisy .
Such action is also extraordinarily politically stupid .
The Republican party is risking the support of millions of veterans and military voters who have long gravitated to our party .
Republicans in Congress must now take account of the choice that our party faces .
We can restore our national security position as intellectual conservatives , or we can continue to morph into a party of ideological partisans .
We can follow in the intellectual legacy of scholars like Henry Kissinger , or we can pursue the foreign policy expertise of a Herman Cain .
We can embrace the heritage of leaders like Abraham Lincoln , or we can sacrifice our military at the altar of Grover Norquist .
This is our choice ."
2011-12-19,"Long , long ago â€ “ well , on Friday night to be exact
â€ “ it looked like a two - month extension of the expiring payroll tax cut was on a glide path to passage in both the House and Senate , preventing an automatic tax increase on 160 million workers on January 1 and giving Republicans and Democrats until the end of February to negotiate an extension through the end of 2012 .
But as soon as the deal was announced , House GOP aides privately speculated that the deal would n't fly with the majority of their caucus despite a buy - in from Speaker John Boehner , Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell , all of his deputies and the vast majority of Senate Republicans .
Sure enough , they were right .
The deal collapsed in spectacular fashion early Saturday .
After passing the Senate with an overwhelming majority , Boehner presented the deal to his members , many of whom â€ ” including Boehner 's top lieutenants â€ ” rejected it .
Sunday morning , he appeared on NBC to declare it dead on arrival .
The rebellion is a striking rebuke by House conservatives of the party 's leadership .
And it throws into doubt whether Congress will be able to renew the payroll tax cut , extended unemployment benefits , and Medicare physician reimbursements in the next two weeks .
Boehner 's members do n't want to replay this fight in two months during the height of primary season , when President Obama is in campaign mode .
But that leaves them making several arguments that do n't really pass the smell test : that the Senate payroll tax bill , which was drafted by McConnell and Harry Reid , and received 89 votes , including from such noteworthy liberals as , er , Marco Rubio , is actually a Democratic bill ; that the House 's highly partisan bill , which extends the payroll cut for a full year , is an equally viable alternative ; and that after a year of operating the government by brinkmanship , and resolving standoffs behind closed doors , that the appropriate way forward now is for party leaders to "" conference "" the House 's partisan bill with the Senate 's consensus package .
Despite the implicit slap in the face by House Republicans , McConnell seems to have accepted their demands . ""
The House and Senate have both passed bipartisan bills to require the president to finally make a decision on the Keystone XL jobs , and to extend additional unemployment insurance , the temporary payroll tax cut and seniors ' access to medical care , "" his spokesman Don Stewart emailed me in a statement Sunday .
"" The House and the president both want a full - year extension .
The best way to resolve the difference between the two - month extension and the full - year bill , and provide certainty for job creators , employees and the long - term unemployed , is through regular order , as the Speaker suggested .
"" That was n't Reid 's understanding .
Boehner had deputized McConnell to cut a deal that would get bipartisan support in both chambers , and is implicitly threatening to present Boehner the Senate passed bill as a take - it - or - leave - it proposition .
"" When we met last week , Speaker Boehner requested that Senator McConnell and I work out a compromise .
Neither side got everything they wanted , but we forged a middle ground that passed the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan majority , "" Reid said in a Sunday statement .
"" If Speaker Boehner refuses to vote on the bipartisan compromise that passed the Senate with 89 votes , Republicans will be forcing a thousand - dollar tax increase on middle class families on January 1 . "" If he sticks to his guns , that leaves Boehner over a barrel .
If the Senate bill remains the only viable legislation , Boehner will have to alienate the majority of his caucus and his leadership team to pass it , or the GOP will face severe political backlash when the tax cut expires .
There are still 14 days between now and then .
But with an 89-vote bill in his back pocket , Reid has a very viable argument that the Senate package should stand , or be amended on very Democratic - friendly terms .
If that 's the path Reid takes , it will be the make - or - break moment for Boehner 's speakership that everyone expected all year .

2011-12-20,"A friend covering the Hill impasse over the payroll tax cuts insists that Speaker John Boehner 's job has become a task of "" herding squirrels . ""
Not cats , the more typical go - to clichÃ © for trying to organize the unorganizable , but squirrels : "" Squirrels are panicky and prone to irrational running into traffic .
"" This is an apt enough metaphor , as no matter what the eventual policy outcome â€
“
an extension of the tax cut or no â€ “ Congressional Republicans are roadkill .
The question is just whether or not Democrats will chase out into the street after them .
The House has a reputation for making pointless ideological stands at the expense of their own political capital , and this stand - still will drag the Congressional approval rating even lower than the miserable 18 % it already is .
They are making a showy refusal to "" tax the job creators "" ( millionaires ) , though the two - month extension passed by the Senate does n't have a millionaire tax
â€
“
it 's paid for by fee increases on mortgages insured by GOP bugaboos Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
Never mind that making these entities less competitive ( the fee would theoretically make private insurers more attractive ) is exactly the kind of "" free - market "" solution to the government 's involvement in the housing market that conservatives say they want .
Thus the House Republicans ' resistance to the compromise hammered out by the Senate Republicans and the White House seems born out of a generalized obstinacy that voters have shown little patience with ; it 's not even an ideological stance so much as petulance .
The House leadership has implied it 's the Tea Party purists that wo n't budge , but the GOP tied itself to the Tea Party ; they thought they 'd be able to siphon off its energy without getting hijacked in the Tea Party 's direction .
Heh .
And does it matter who 's trying to buck whose compromise or just that Americans are not going to see that extra percentage of their paychecks ?
Privately , all parties are said to agree that the payroll tax reduction is a Good Thing , and that how to "" pay for "" or "" offset "" its cost ( a calculation neither side brought up when the tax cut was first introduced ) is less important than the stimulus it could give the economy â€ “ but neither side is willing to take the risk of appearing not to care about deficits .
Deficits are the most important thing ever , except when they 're not : feel free to get into a costly , no - end - in - sight war without a clue how to pay for it , say , but let 's not give the middle class more money in their pockets at a time they 're desperate for relief .
Some argue that the general stink of desperate gamesmanship will cling to all parties ; the White House clearly hopes that emphasizing the benefits of the cut will keep the stench around Obama to a minimum .
Only the GOP nominees have a hope of smelling relatively clean , but they 're busy throwing crap at each other ."
2011-12-22,"Republican disunity over the congressional tax showdown was exposed on Thursday when , in an extraordinary move , the party 's leader in the Senate publicly broke ranks with his House colleagues .
After days of silence , Mitch McConnell lined up with Barack Obama and the Democrats to call for the safe passage of the payroll tax bill , instead of rallying behind his beleaguered colleague in the House , speaker John Boehner .
The rupture in the Republican party increases Obama 's chances of securing a rare victory over the House Republicans , who have repeatedly humiliated him this year .
Boehner is blocking passage of a bill that would extend tax breaks to 160 million Americans , a measure introduced by Obama last year to help stimulate the US economy .
If the bill is not passed by 31 December , American taxpayers face cuts in their pay of an average of $ 40 every two weeks .
About 1.3 million people stand to lose unemployment benefit .
Obama , at a White House event organised to step up pressure on Boehner , described the standoff as "" ridiculous "" , and paraded some of the 30,000 Americans who have written to the White House detailing the impact the tax rises would have on their lives .
For some , the $ 40 is significant , meaning the loss of heating for almost half a week .
For others , the impact is small but meaningful , from parents unable to take their children out for a pizza , to a man driving 200 miles a week to keep his father - in - law company in a nursing home .
Intent on wringing as much emotion as possible from the moment and portraying the Republicans as the party of the wealthy , Obama said : "" It may be that there are some folks in the House who refuse to vote for this compromise because they do n't think that $ 40 is a lot of money .
But anyone who knows what it 's like to stretch a budget knows that at the end of the week , or the end of the month , $ 40 can make all the difference in the world . ""
Boehner is increasingly isolated on the issue , criticised by Republicans from senator John McCain to party strategist Karl Rove , and one of the media 's bastions of conservatism , the Wall Street Journal .
They have all called on Boehner to back off , claiming he is hurting the Republican party and its chances of winning the White House next November .
But McConnell 's statement presented an even bigger setback for the House speaker .
McConnell said working Americans "" should n't face the uncertainty of a New Year 's Day tax hike "" , and urged the House to pass the bill to avoid "" any disruption in the payroll tax holiday "" .
The Senate on Saturday voted overwhelmingly for a deal â€ “ backed by McConnell and the Democratic leader in the Senate , Harry Reid â€ “ to extend tax cuts for two months to allow further negotiations on extending them through to the end of next year .
Obama welcomed the deal .
But on Monday , House Republicans , in an unexpected about - turn , blocked it .
Boehner , having reportedly reached a behind - the - scenes agreement last week with McConnell to support the bill , went into reverse , under pressure from House members close to the Tea Party movement .
The standoff with the House Republicans is turning into an early Christmas gift for Obama .
Throughout this year , Boehner and his colleagues have left the president looking weak , and forced him to back down in a series of showdowns over issues including America 's debt ceiling .
Grassroots Democrats repeatedly cite this supposed weakness as one of the reasons for their disappoinment with Obama .
But if he can end the year with a political victory over Republicans in the House , it could help his chances of re - election next year .
Democratic strategists decided months ago Obama will fight the next election portraying the Republicans as obstructionist .
He took up this theme on Thursday , saying he would sign the tax bill immediately on receiving it from Congress , and the only thing stopping it was what he called a "" faction "" inside the Republican party . ""
What 's happening right now is exactly why people just get so frustrated with Washington .
This is it : this is exactly why people get so frustrated , "" Obama said .
"" This is n't a typical Democratic - versus - Republican issue .
This is an issue where an overwhelming number of people in both parties agree .
How can we not get that done ?
I mean , has this place become so dysfunctional that even when people agree to things we ca n't do it ?
It does n't make any sense not to reach a deal .
The president has delayed his holiday to Hawaii because of the standoff .
His family left without him .
Boehner phoned Obama at the White House on Thursday morning , asking him to send an economics team to Congress to discuss the issue .
Obama refused ."
2011-12-23,"Before British prime minister David Cameron went into his fateful European Union negotiations regarding the euro earlier this month , it is said he used the "" full bladder technique "" .
To concentrate the mind on the task at hand he remained "" desperate for a pee "" throughout both the formal dinner and talks .
When it came to sealing the deal he subsequently went and pissed Britain 's bargaining position up the wall .
One can only guess what John Boehner 's strategy has been during the past week over the payroll tax cuts .
But it looks like he employed the "" full bowel technique "" with equal success .
His Tea Party caucus kept stuffing him with rhetorical bran muffins so that every time he went to a microphone he was full of it .
Then , when crunch time arrived , the Republican establishment , the White House and Democrats in Congress teamed up and beat the crap out of him .
The Republican party 's internal division and public humiliation this week felt like a moment that was such a long time coming it seemed as though it would never arrive .
But the ramifications are not limited to Congress .
The very mayhem that has been evident in Washington DC this week has been playing out in Iowa and New Hampshire these past few months , and will continue through the coming presidential year .
Adrenalin could keep the Tea Party going only so long outside the fetid ecosystem of Fox News , talk radio and the internet , before reality intervened and forced some kind of reckoning .
They ca n't have everything they want , and wo n't take the considerable amount they can get .
So they cast around from crisis to crisis and candidate to candidate exploding with rage and imploding with contradictions until there 's very little left but the venom .
This most recent debacle was perhaps the most spectacular unraveling yet
â€ “ the congressional equivalent of Rick Perry 's oops moment .
Republicans in the Senate had reached an agreement with the Democrats to extend the temporary payroll tax cut for a further two months while the two sides hammer out the details for a longer - term resolution on how to pay for it .
To an average family this means about $ 80 a month more coming into their bank accounts as they come out of the Christmas season .
Most assumed it would fly through the Republican - controlled House .
After all , it 's a tax cut .
Republicans like tax cuts .
Indeed , sometimes it seems that 's all they like .
The Senate went home .
But the Republicans in the House decided it was n't enough .
They wanted more .
And so Boehner had to go out and demand more .
He talked tough .
But he also talked nonsense .
In the name of smaller government he was insisting on higher taxes .
Even his Republican colleagues in the Senate would not buy it ; the Democrats would n't wear it ; the country could n't afford it .
He marched them up to the top of the hill , where they were shot at by their own troops , and then he marched them down again .
Oops .
Threats of government shutdowns and legislative crises have become so routine since the Republicans took over the House and the Tea Party took over the Republicans that it 's become difficult to take them seriously .
Whether it 's budget talks or the debt ceiling , the impasse follows a predictable pattern .
Both Obama and the Republicans stake out a position .
Obama then caves in on pretty much everything in return for letting it look as though he is running the country .
Then the Republicans come back and ask for more .
Obama draws a line in the sand . ""
Eric , do n't call my bluff , "" he told House majority leader , Eric Cantor , during the budget talks . ""
This may bring my presidency down , but I will not yield on this . ""
Eric called his buff .
Obama yielded .
The line is washed away and the president lives to capitulate another day .
But this time there was nothing more to yield .
Obama had already caved to the Senate Republicans , by abandoning his demand that the cuts be funded by raising taxes on millionaires .
What House Republicans were rejecting was already a bipartisan agreement between an overpliant White House and an overreaching GOP .
What Boehner demanded was a tripartisan agreement between the Republicans , the Democrats and the Tea Party .
This time that was not possible .
Having put a gun to the head of the economy several times unless millionaires kept their tax cuts , this time Boehner was holding middle - class families hostage and threatening them with tax hikes unless â€ ¦ and there was the problem .
No one really understood what he wanted â€ “ apart from to have his own way .
It was not until he found himself in the crosshairs of the entire political class that he realized he 'd already shot himself in the foot .
This reflects the confusion that is taking place in the primary race .
The Tea Party keeps thrashing around for someone , anyone , in whom they can invest their zeal and who the rest of their party ( never mind the rest of the country ) can live with .
They 've pretty much been through the pack and just when you think they 've hit bottom they plumb new depths .
It turns out there is no one who both makes sense to the Tea Party and the rest of the world , let alone their fellow Republicans .
These are the people who have been dictating the pace and shape of economic reform for the last year .
These are the birthers who believe in death panels , hate government intrusion unless it involves a woman 's uterus and love wars and tax cuts but hate budget deficits .
They are also the people who have re - energised the Republican party from its post - McCain torpor and revitalized its fortunes in 2010 .
They are the reason Obama still has a shot at the presidency and why Romney is still struggling for the nomination .
They are the muffin peddlers ; and they think with their gut ."
2012-06-21,"House Speaker John Boehner escalated the Fast and Furious row Thursday by claiming that Barack Obama 's deployment of executive privilege power was an admission that the White House was involved in the alleged Mexican drug cartel arms cover - up .
Boehner , at a press conference in Congress , said up until Obama used the power there had been no inkling of White House involvement .
Until then , the issue had been confined to the attorney - general Eric Holder and justice department , Boehner said .
"" The American people deserve the truth about what happened in Fast and Furious , "" Boehner said .
"" The Terry family deserve answers about why their son was killed . ""
The Mexican cartel case , known as Fast and Furious , centres on the drugs operation known as Fast and Furious , in which US agents turned a blind eye to arms being smuggled across the Mexican border .
The agents had set up the sting operation in the hope they could trace the smuggled guns to high - ranking traffickers linked to drugs cartels .
But agents from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives in Arizona , lost track of more than 1,000 weapons .
Two of the weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of US border patrol agent Brian Terry in December 2010 .
Republicans claim that Holder misled Congress by initially claiming he knew nothing about it , only to admit later documents showed he had been briefed about it .
Republicans issued a subpoena demanding more documents from the justice department but Obama exercised his executive privilege on Wednesday , just hours before the oversight committee vote , to block this .
The courts can not overturn the executive privilege power .
Without access to the papers , it is difficult for Republicans or any judge considering the issue to move the story forward .
Boehner , however , did not join in calls for Holder to resign .
Earlier today , Florida senator Marco Rubio joined the growing Republican clamour calling for the resignation of Holder over the Fast and Furious issue .
Rubio , one of the rising stars of the Republican party and on the shortlist for Mitt Romney 's vice - presidential running - mate , replied in the affirmative when asked by a reporter if he supported calls for Holder to go .
"" I think we are at the point of no return , "" Rubio was reported as saying by the Daily Caller website .
The Republican - dominated House oversight committee voted 23 - 17 on Wednesday to recommend that Holder be held in contempt of Congress for failing to hand over department of justice documents relating to the operation .
The whole House is scheduled to vote on the issue next week .
Holder is unlikely to resign .
He has survived bigger rows , in particular over failed Guantanamo closure plans and over his retreat from a planned trial in New York of self - confessed 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
After the Republican - dominated House , as expected , votes next week to back the committee 's recommendation to hold Holder in contempt , the issue will almost certainly disappear into the courts for months to come .
The chances of a judge finding Holder in contempt are extremely slim .
Calling for the resignation of an attorney - general would normally be regarded as a major step for a serious politician , one that would risk them being categorised as a "" rent - a - quote "" .
But Rubio was not speaking in isolation , with several other Republican senators also calling on Holder to go , including Orrin Hatch and John Cornyn and members of the House such as Steve King , who is well to the right of the party and a prominent Tea Party supporter .
The Republicans claim Holder misled Congress when he initially denied knowledge of the operation and that he failed to act on a subpoena to hand over documents related to the case .
The scene is set for another protracted showdown between the White House and Congress .
Since the Republicans won control of the House in November 2010 , there has been almost continuous warfare between them and Obama , mainly over debt ."
2012-07-19,"John Boehner , the leading Republican in Congress , has chastised his colleague Michele Bachmann over allegations she made linking a key aide of Hillary Clinton to Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood .
Boehner said on Thursday that the comments â€ “ made in a letter from Bachmann to the state department and Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison â€ “ about the family of Huma Abedin were "" pretty dangerous "" .
He joins John McCain in rebuking Bachmann over claims that Abedin 's father , mother and brother were connected to the Islamist group .
In her letter , Bachmann questioned how , given her ' family connections ' , Abedin had been given security clearance .
Bachmann , citing foreign news reports , suggested that Abedin 's relatives were known to be connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives or organisations .
This was especially worrying as Abedin 's position "" affords her routine access to the secretary and policy - making "" , Bachmann added .
In the letter , Bachmann wondered how Abedin was not disqualified for a US security clearance "" given what we know from the international media about Abedin 's documented family connections with the extremist Muslim Brotherhood . ""
Speaking on Thursday , Boehner said : "" From everything I do know of [ Abedin ] , she has a sterling character , and I think accusations like this being thrown around are pretty dangerous "" .
He added that he did not know Abedin personally .
Boehner became the second senior party member in as many days to publicly rebuke Bachmann over the comments .
On Wednesday , McCain took to the Senate floor to defend Abedin .
Without mentioning Bachmann by name , McCain described the attacks on Abedin , a Muslim , as an example of ignorance and fear . ""
Huma represents what is best about America â€ “ the daughter of immigrants , who has risen to the highest levels of our government on the basis of her substantial personal merit and her abiding commitment to the American ideals that she embodies so fully .
"" I am proud to know Huma and to call her my friend , "" McCain added .
McCain , who ran against Barack Obama for the White House in 2008 , pointed out that Abedin 's father died two decades ago , and that Bachmann failed to provide "" one instance of an action , decision or a public position that Huma has taken while at the state department that would lend credence to the charge that she is promoting anti - American activities within our government "" .
McCain added : "" When anyone , not least a member of Congress , launches specious and degrading attacks against fellow Americans on the basis of nothing more than fear of who they are and ignorance of what they stand for , it defames the spirit of our nation , and we all grow poorer because of it . ""
The furore around Bachmann 's comments come a week after Clinton , the secretary of state , became the most senior member of the US government to meet with new Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi , the Muslim Brotherhood leader .
The White House is attempting to cultivate new ties with Egypt 's new Islamist rulers following the removal of the Hosni Mubarak , the hardline president who was formerly backed by Washington , last year .
Abedin , the wife of former New York congressman Anthony Weiner , has been an aide to Clinton for more than 15 years , and currently serves as the state secretary 's deputy chief of staff ."
2012-08-28,"Unhappy Republican delegates have staged a rare revolt at the party 's national convention in Tampa , noisily protesting against rules changes they claim crack down on grassroots supporters .
The protesters accused the party leadership of steamrolling the changes through .
They shouted "" object "" , "" point of order "" , "" division "" , "" liberty "" and "" USA "" as John Boehner , the House speaker , pressed ahead , ignoring them .
Boehner claimed the rules had been passed by a voice vote in spite of the protests .
The revolt was staged by delegates mainly from Texas and Maine , some of them supporters of the libertarian Ron Paul .
One of the protesters , Phillip Payne , 33 , owner of a land - surveying company and member of the Texas delegation , said : "" This is a power grab . ""
Wearing a cowboy hat like his fellow Texan delegates , he blamed the party leadership in general rather than the presidential candidate Mitt Romney .
"" It is a about principle .
It is not about Paul .
It is a liberty issue , "" Payne said .
"" This is going to disenfranchise a lot of enthusiastic grassroots people such as the Tea Party activists , "" he added .
It is rare at modern conventions to have such revolts , given how carefully orchestrated they have become .
They are especially rare for Republicans , who are usually highly disciplined .
The protest reflects to some extent the split in the Republican Party between the old establishment and the relatively new Tea Party activists and the libertarians gathered round Paul .
In a further sign of the continuing trouble Paul and his supporters pose for Romney and the Republican leadership , the delegations from Minnesota , Nevada and Iowa announced on the convention floor that they were voting for the Texas congressman , even though he failed to win those or any other states during the primary and caucus process .
This was possible because Paul 's extensive grassroots network was able to dominate congressional district and state conventions in these states and elsewhere .
It is this sort of under - the - radar delegate strategy that the Republican leadership wanted to stop by changing the party 's rules , to the fury of some delegates .
They objected to a change to Rule 12 that would allow Republican leaders to make changes to party rules between conventions .
Until now , changes could usually only be made at conventions .
The other objection was to Rule 16 that would require states to allocate delegates according to the statewide vote rather than a winner - take - all approach .
This is aimed at states such as Maine where Paul supporters are accused of taking over the nominating process , allocating 20 of the 24 delegates to Paul .
As part of the revolt , protesters attempted to gather the 29 signatures needed from members of the party rules committee .
This would have allowed minority reports objecting to the rules changes to be heard on the floor .
But the protesters failed to secure the necessary signatures .
One of the minority reports objecting to the changes came from the Texas delegation .
Melinda Fredericks , 52 , is a member of the Texas delegation but also a member of the rules committee .
She had supported the Texas minority report .
She expressed sorrow that the changes had gone through .
"" I am not happy about it , "" she said .
"" I have conflicting feelings .
"" She was disappointed there had not been enough notice to allow time to discuss it with her delegation .
She added , however , that the Texas delegation had secured some concessions .
The leadership power to make changes between conventions would only apply up until 2014 and not the next convention in 2016 .
But the Texans were not united in protest .
Some resented the public display of protest .
Jan Koehne , 71 , a rancher and gun seller , said some of the protesters were not active members of the party , rarely taking part in the state conventions , and did not understand that decisions were reached gradually ."
2012-09-14,"Almost 24 hours after the Federal Reserve announced another blockbuster programme to prop up the US 's lackluster economy , one of its biggest critics remains strangely silent .
Paul Ryan , the Republican vice - presidential candidate , has yet to comment on Fed chairman Ben Bernanke 's plan to inject $ 40bn into the US economy every month for the foreseeable future .
Spotted by CBS reporter Sarah Boxer on his way to House speaker John Boehner 's office yesterday , all he had to say was : "" Oh , I 'm just here to see some of my friends . ""
Ahead of the announcement Ryan was far more outspoken , specifically coming out against a third round of quantitative easing ( QE3 ) from the Fed in an interview with financial news channel CNBC on 7 September .
"" I think QE3 â€ “
I think QE â€ “ the costs outweigh the benefits in my personal opinion , "" said Ryan .
"" If borrowing and spending and regulating and taxing was the secret to economic success , we would be entering a golden age along with Greece , "" Ryan said .
"" It 's not .
It does n't work .
We need sound money , low tax rates , fiscal discipline , regulatory certainty and we need to stop this notion of a government - driven economy . ""
On 23 August he made the same case to CNBC 's Larry Kudlow : "" We want to pursue a sound money strategy so that we can get back the king dollar , as you say it , Larry .
Number two , I 'm not a fan of more stimulus or more easing .
I think the benefits are clearly outweighed by the long - term costs of this .
There â€ “ it 's not working , and all this loose money from the Fed is basically bailing out the fact President Obama has failed on fiscal policy .
The Fed ca n't keep bailing out bad fiscal policy .
We need to get our fiscal policy right . ""
So where is Ryan now ?
His would - be boss Mitt Romney sort of discussed the Fed 's move on ABC 's Good Morning America on Friday : ""
What Bernanke 's doing is saying that what the president 's saying is wrong .
The president 's saying the economy 's making progress , coming back .
Bernanke 's saying , ' No , it 's not .
I 've got to print more money . ""
But so far there has been no real critique of QE3 .
All very strange really , especially as Ryan appears to have picked in part for his hardline financial philosophy and not just his puppy dog eyes .
The Dow is soaring Friday and hit highs unseen since 2007 on Thursday .
Perhaps Ryan has been muzzled while the Republicans wait to see if and when the rally will subside .
He did mention America 's debts .
But still nothing on Ben .
And then he was off to the safety of sports .
Whatever happened to :
no Ben no ?"

Protesters fear that federal funding for Medicaid , which helps low - income adults in the US with healthcare costs , will be a target for cuts in any deal .

2012-11-28,"Just over a month from now , the United States will go over the proverbial fiscal cliff into a scary new world of higher taxes , reduced spending and austerity politics .
The potential for such a Congress - made calamity has provoked a sense of doom not only in Washington , DC , but also in financial markets where there is a pervasive fear that a fall off the cliff will create an immediate economic crisis .
Practically everyone in Washington , from President Obama to House Speaker John Boehner , has expressed confidence that a deal can be reached by the end of the year to prevent this from happening .
Allow me to offer an alternative take : not only will a major deal not be reached by the end of the year , but one should n't be reached .
For purely political reasons , both Democrats and Republicans have everything to gain by letting the United States fall off the cliff â€ “ and then pick up the pieces after 1 January .
Now , it 's important to remember that all this discussion about a fiscal cliff is a bit of a misnomer â€ “ a cliff suggests a precipitous fall to a likely demise .
But in reality , this cliff is more of a slope , or a slow but steady decline , down the road of fiscal austerity .
Yes , tax and spending policies will shift after 1 January : taxes will go up and spending cuts mandated by law will begin to go in effect .
But these are changes that will unfold over many months , and even years .
Indeed , the immediate impact of the "" fiscal cliff "" will be relatively minor .
As the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities noted recently : "" A relatively brief implementation of the tax and spending changes required by current law should cause little short - term damage to the economy as a whole .
"" This is n't to say that markets wo n't have a collective freakout or that confidence in Congress to actually do its job will decline further , but those are manageable issues , particularly because , once Washington goes over the cliff , it becomes much easier to quickly reach a deal between Republicans and Democrats .
The reason has everything to do with the Republican party and it 's party - wide allergy to any proposal that would raise taxes .
While there are serious issues that need to be debated in fiscal cliff talks , the political heart of the matter is the full expiration of the Bush tax cuts at the end of the year â€ “ and President Obama 's insistence that tax rates must go up on wealthier Americans and must stay where they are on those making less than $ 250,000 .
For a deal to be reached before 1 January , Republicans would have to do one of two things : first , they 'd have to agree to a compromise that would have them voting for tax increases on wealthy Americans ; or , second , they would have to find enough revenue elsewhere in the tax code to make up the difference that higher tax rates would bring in .
The former is a virtual impossibility because it would mean violating the anti - tax pledge that 95 % of House Republicans have signed , under the watchful eye of conservative activist and head of Americans for Tax Reform , Grover Norquist .
As South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham , who is slightly to the left of the anti - tax jihad contingent of the GOP , noted on Sunday : "" No Republican will vote for higher tax rates .
"" There is no reason to doubt him .
For all the recent declarations of independence from Republicans on the tax issue , in the end , the vast majority will never vote for a tax increase , under any conditions .
So , what about raising revenue elsewhere ?
This is not impossible , but will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve .
Not only will Republicans have to identify various deductions and loopholes to close in the tax code by 1 January , but they will also need to craft a plan that is agreeable to President Obama , who will be under enormous pressure to stick to his pledge that tax rates on the richest Americans must go up .
Indeed , it has been a great source of amusement to watch Republicans tie themselves in knots trying to come up with any solution or any proposal that will allow them to not have to vote on raising tax rates .
There is , of course , an easier solution to this problem : do nothing .
Let the tax cuts expire on 1 January , with taxes going up on every American .
Then , Congress can quickly pass a massive tax cut for those making less than $ 250,000 , retroactive to 1 January .
Neither side will want to wait long and force Americans to pay higher taxes , but especially Republicans wo n't â€ “ as they will likely be blamed if no deal is swiftly reached .
To do so would mean that all sides are politically satisfied : President Obama can say he stuck to his word about raising taxes on rich Americans , and taxes will have gone up without Republicans having to cast a vote ; and both parties can reap the political benefit and claim credit for having cut taxes for the middle class .
Now , granted , this wo n't solve all the challenges of the "" fiscal cliff "" : there will still be the issue of automatic cuts to domestic and defense spending programs , an end to unemployment insurance for millions of Americans , changes to the Medicare program that will create lower reimbursement rates for providers , and a series of other tax cuts , like the current payroll tax cut , the Earned Income Tax Credit and the perennial issue of the alternative minimum tax cut .
While this is perhaps overly optimistic , all of these are problems that â€ “ while not easy to solve â€ “ present far less of a challenge than the tricky politics of tax policy .
Republicans may have to give a little on domestic spending and tax breaks for the working and middle class , in return for extending tax cuts for their corporate benefactors and more money back for the Pentagon .
Democrats will likely have to make some concessions on Medicare spending , but almost certainly to the provider side , rather than in actual benefits to recipients .
And when it comes to deficit reduction , once the upper - income Bush tax cuts have expired , then Washington has made a major dow - payment in reducing the deficit .
In the end , neither side has all that much to gain from dragging the fiscal cliff argument out .
Now that President Obama has won re - election , and doing short - term damage to the economy is no longer in the political interests of Republicans , the outlines of a budget deal become that much easier to achieve .
Moreover , all those House Republicans have to run for re - election in two years â€ “ and would prefer to do so in more optimal economic conditions , rather than in an economy undermined by growth - reducing austerity policies .
There were once good political reasons for Republicans to have a dalliance with economic calamity ; no longer is that true .
And it 's worth remembering that in virtually every single showdown between Obama and the Republican Congress in his first term ( from the tax cut showdown of 2010 and the budget battle of early 2011 , to the debt limit negotiations in the summer of 2011 and finally the payroll tax confrontation in the beginning of 2012 ) , it has been Republicans who have surrendered , with far less than half a loaf .
In its brinkmanship , the GOP likes to dance right up to the edge ; they are far less inclined to take the plunge .
Republicans and Democrats will eventually reach a deal on the fiscal cliff : it might come before 1 January , but the more likely scenario is that it will happen after the new year ( or possibly , it will be agreed to before 1 January and be voted on after ) .
But that deal will happen because it 's pretty much in everyone 's best interests for it to occur .
So , for now , everyone just needs to chill out ."
2012-11-29,"The Republican leader John Boehner has shot down reports that Washington is nearing a solution to the year - end fiscal cliff budget crisis , saying there has been "" no substantive progress "" over the last two weeks .
"" Jobs are on the line , the American economy is on the line , and this is a moment for adult leadership .
The White House has to get serious , "" Boehner , the speaker of the House of Representatives , said after meeting treasury secretary Tim Geithner on Capitol Hill on Thursday .
Boehner 's comments came amid reports of a breakthrough in negotiations to avert the year - end imposition of tax hikes and massive spending cuts .
In a nationally televised statement on Wednesday night , president Barack Obama said : "" Our ultimate goal is to get an agreement that is fair and balanced . ""
The president also said that he hoped to "" get this done before Christmas "" .
Boehner , who has spoken to Obama twice in recent days , met Geithner on Thursday in the hope of averting a crisis that economists have warned could push the US back into recession .
The two parties are at loggerheads â€ “ with the Democrats pushing for tax hikes for the rich and Republicans calling for deep government spending cuts â€ “ as they attempt to tackle the US 's $ 16tn debt .
At a press conference in Washington , Boehner said : "" I 'm disappointed about where we are
and I 'm disappointed about where we 've been over the last couple of weeks .
"" Based on where we stand today â€ “ first , despite the claims that the president supports a balanced approach , the Democrats have yet to get serious about real spending cuts .
And secondly , no substantive progress have been made in the talks between the White House and the House over the last two weeks . ""
His statement came after Geithner met Republican leaders including Boehner , House majority leader Eric Cantor and the former vice - presidential pick and House budget committee chairman Paul Ryan , in his latest attempt to forge a budget consensus .
Harry Reid , the Democratic majority leader in the Senate , was dismissive of Boehner 's remarks .
"" I do n't understand his brain , "" he said after his own meeting with Geithner .
Reid added : "" Democrats are all of the same page .
For two weeks we have been waiting for a serious offer from Republicans .
"" Obama and Boehner spoke for 15 minutes on Wednesday night .
Obama had spent part of the day discussing the crisis with business leaders .
On Thursday , Obama had lunch with his former presidential rival Mitt Romney , amid rumors that he was considering Romney 's proposal to cap tax breaks for the rich .
The White House said the lunch was private .
Boehner 's suggestion that a compromise was far from certain were echoed by other Republicans .
"" It is not going to happen soon , "" Senator John Barrasso told Fox Business News .
Stock markets largely shrugged off the latest posturing from Washington , remaining broadly flat at lunchtime ."
2012-11-30,"John Boehner , the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives , has dismissed the latest White House proposals on the fiscal cliff negotiations , declaring them "" not serious "" .
Speaking to the media at the Capitol , Boehner claimed that "" a similar amount of revenue "" could be raised from cutting tax loopholes and deductions as from the tax increases being discussed by the White House . ""
Increasing tax rates draws money away from our economy , "" Boehner said , in response to a question .
The White House plan envisaged $ 1.6tn to be raised from new taxes , in exchange for $ 400bn in cuts to entitlement programs .
But Republicans claimed that the proposals put forward by the treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , were identical to those that were presented by President Barack Obama at the White House earlier this month .
Asked if the GOP 's position was just posturing , Boehner said : There 's a stalemate , let 's not kid ourselves .
I 'm not trying to make this more difficult ... at the moment we 're almost nowhere .
Boehner was then asked : Do you think the White House is trying to squeeze you ?
Boehner said he was always ready to work with the other party .
But when asked what the GOP wanted to see cut from entitlements , Boehner was no more forthcoming than usual : You can look at our budget for the last two years , there are plenty of specific proposals .
A reporter then pointed out that even under the fabled Paul Ryan budget plan , cuts to Medicare would n't take affect for years , and did n't Boehner want something more quickly ?
Boehner did not answer ."
2012-12-03,"Republican leaders have made their first counter bid in the ongoing poker game with the White House over the fiscal cliff , proposing new tax revenues and cuts in health and social security spending but continuing to resist any discussion of raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans .
The counter - proposal comes in the form of a letter to President Obama signed by six prominent Republicans , including John Boehner , speaker of the House of Representatives ; House majority leader Eric Cantor ; and Paul Ryan , Mitt Romney 's vice - presidential candidate and a leading fiscal conservative .
The letter begins on a note of compromise .
The Republican signatories say that in the wake of "" a status quo election â€ ¦ the American people rightly expect both parties to come together on a fair middle ground and address the nation 's most pressing challenges .
"" The proposal is based on previous work by Erskine Bowles , a former chief of staff to Bill Clinton who co - chaired the Simpson - Bowles commission that last year failed to find a way through the fiscal impasse .
It proposes $ 800bn in new tax revenues â€ “ a significant step by the Republicans who have tended to resist any such move .
But it sidesteps the cause of the current deadlock by continuing to refuse to allow the tax rate on the top 2 % of income earners to rise back to the levels held under the Clinton administration .
Instead , the tax rises would come from closing "" special - interest loopholes and deductions "" while lowering tax rates for all Americans , including the very rich .
That is unlikely to satisfy Obama , who since he was returned to the White House in the 6 November election has adopted a far more bullish stance in his negotiations with the Republicans .
The new - look tough Obama was underlined by Jay Carney , White House spokesman , who told reporters earlier in the day : "" The president will not sign a bill that extends the Bush - era tax cuts for the top 2 % .
Full stop . ""
Carney emphasised the electoral mandate which the Obama team of negotiators believe give him a strong position as the talks on the fiscal crisis enter their tense final days .
If agreement is not reached by 1 January , then a $ 607bn package of cuts and tax rises automatically kick in .
The Republicans want to maintain present advantageous tax rates for the wealthy , but "" the American people overwhelmingly disagree , "" Carney said .
Obama also took to the stage of the social media platform Twitter in an attempt to sustain popular pressure on Congress in favour of a deal that would include tax rises on those above $ 250,000 in income .
In his Twitter town hall , Obama expressed his willingness to find a compromise with the Republicans .
He said in one tweet "" do n't expect 100 % my budget ; room to negotiate "" .
But he also kept up the heat on the opposition party by warning that if they continued to resist the end of the Bush - era tax cuts for the top 2 % of earners , that would lead to "" cuts w / out revenue = reductions in student loans ; work / study and college tax credits expire .
Bad for growth . ""
He also warned that failure of Congress to budge on taxes would lead to possible cuts in the tax deductions for home owners â€ “ a move that would be highly unpopular with large numbers of voters and could cost the Republicans dear . ""
If top rates do n't go up , danger that middle class deductions get hit , "" Obama tweeted .
In their letter , the Republican leaders also propose $ 600bn of cuts in federal health budgets and savings of $ 200bn achieved by using a lower rate of inflation to calculate government benefits such as social security .
The plan remains very light on details â€ “ a criticism frequently levelled by the White House at the Republicans in recent weeks ."
2012-12-03,"Republican leader John Boehner said Sunday he was "" flabbergasted "" by Treasury secretary Tim Geithner plan to save the nation from the fiscal cliff , in the latest show of brinkmanship over a deal to avert the year end budget crises .
His statement came as Washington leaders took to the airwaves amid an escalation in the clash over how to avert the automatic triggering of massive spending cuts and the expiration of across - the - board tax cuts .
Geithner went on a media blitz Sunday to defend president Barack Obama 's position over the fiscal cliff .
With less than a month to go , Geithner said he could not promise Congress would find a solution .
If the tax rates expire and cuts are imposed as they stand , the Congressional Budget Office calculates the US will be plunged back into recession and unemployment will spike to 9.1 % .
"" That 's a decision that lies in the hands of the Republicans that are now opposing an increase in tax rates "" for the wealthiest Americans , Geithner told Fox News Sunday .
Geithner told CBS 's Face the Nation : "" Just remember to extend those tax cuts costs $ 1tn dollars over 10 years .
There is no way we can get back to a balanced plan that put us back on the path to living within our means , protects Medicare , invests in things we need , if you extend those tax cuts . ""
Boehner , speaker of the House of Representatives , renewed his stand against increased tax rates for the rich . ""
Here 's the problem , "" Boehner told Fox .
"" When you go and increase rates , you make it more difficult for our economy to grow . ""
Boehner said if Republicans agreed to give Obama a proposed $ 1.6tn in new tax revenue , "" He 's going to spend it , "" not reduce the deficit .
Last week , Obama said he believed the two sides would reach an agreement before Christmas .
"" We 're nowhere , "" Boehner said Sunday .
The president 's advisers have set out a plan that calls for the expiration of tax cuts for those earning over $ 250,000 as part of a plan to raise $ 1.6tn more in tax revenues over the next 10 years .
In exchange , Obama agreed to $ 400bn in savings from entitlement programmes over the next 10 years but pushed those talks into next year with no guarantees .
On CBS , Republican senator Lindsey Graham slammed Obama 's plans to tackle the debt crisis by imposing higher taxes on the most wealthy .
He said Obama 's plans failed to address entitlement reform â€ “ cuts in social security and Medicare benefits .
Graham championed a plan first put forward by failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney to cap the size of deductions that the rich can take . ""
If you raise tax rates you get $ 400bn in revenue and you hurt job creation .
If you limit reductions to about $ 40,000-$50,000 per person , you protect the middle class and you get about $ 800bn in revenue , "" he said .
"" And 100 % of Americans are going to lose everything we know as America if we do n't fix entitlements .
We are becoming Greece because of out - of - control entitlements . ""
"" I think we are going over the cliff .
It 's pretty clear to me they have made a political calculation , "" said Graham .

2012-12-04,"Barack Obama has rejected the latest proposal from Republican leaders on how to avoid the fiscal cliff , dismissing their offer as unbalanced and based on faulty calculations .
A day after senior Republicans led by John Boehner , speaker of the House of Representatives , put forward their package of increased tax revenues and cuts in entitlements , Obama poured scorn on it , calling it "" still out of balance .
When you look at the math , it just does n't work "" .
Obama 's objections to the Boehner ideas , given in his first television interview since winning re - election on 6 November , centre on its lack of tax increases for the top 2 % of US earners .
Over the past few days the president has doggedly stuck to this point as a non - negotiable element of his fiscal plans .
"" We 're going to have to see the rates on the top 2 % go up , and we 're not going to be able to get a deal without it , "" he said in an interview with Julianna Goldman of Bloomberg TV .
Under their plans , the Republicans would allow an increase in tax revenue but through attacking the deductions that people are granted rather than by increasing the tax rate for high - income households .
Obama said that the only way such an approach would add up would be if "" you completely eliminated for example charitable deductions , that means every hospital and university and not - for - profit agency across the country would suddenly find themselves on the verge of collapse . ""
The president did hold out a possible carrot to the GOP , however , when he suggested that the deal that would need to be done in the next two weeks to avoid the fiscal cliff occurring on 1 January would be "" down payments "" on a longer term solution .
"" We 're not going to be able to come up with a comprehensive entitlement reform package that gets it all done in the next two weeks , "" he said .
That opened the prospect of a temporary solution being found now , with the promise of a more substantial deal further down the line .
Feasibly , that could involve the tax rate on the top earners rising now to 39.6 % as the president insists , but being lowered again towards the end of 2013 by which time extensive tax reforms , properly conceived , could be introduced .
"" We 'd have to have some specific down payments now , recognising that we would then have to continue to work to see if we can come up with even better ideas to reduce healthcare costs over the long term , "" he said .
As the standoff between the White House and the GOP continued , the debate over how to combat the fiscal crisis widened , with a cross - party group of state governors arriving in Washington .
With 40 % of federal discretionary spending relating to grants to the 50 states , governors are worried that they will become the fall - guy as cuts are passed on to them .
Despite the impasse , Obama sounded an optimistic note on the US economy which he said was poised to take off . ""
Let 's make sure we do n't have a self - inflicted wound , because there are a lot of silly games played up on Capitol Hill . ""
The president deflected a question from Bloomberg TV on whether Republican attacks on the UN ambassador Susan Rice had "" boxed him into a corner "" over her possible appointment as secretary of state .
Rice is presumed to be Obama 's first choice to replace Hillary Clinton , but her comments on the attack on a diplomatic post in Benghazi , Libya , in which four Americans died , has engulfed her in a conservative firestorm .
Obama said he had not yet made a decision on who to nominate to be secretary of state , and swatted away the query by saying "" the most important thing we can do for national security is to get our economy right "" ."
2012-12-09,"President Barack Obama and the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives have met in the latest attempt to break the stalemate in the fiscal crisis negotiations that could propel the US back into recession if no deal is secured by 1 January .
John Boehner , the house speaker , joined the president at the White House in a private meeting that had not been disclosed to the media in advance .
After the event , the two political leaders remained tight - lipped over the nature of their conversation , which was their first since the Republicans produced their counter proposals on the "" fiscal cliff "" a week ago .
The two parties remain separated by a large practical and ideological gulf in their approaches to taxes and spending cuts .
Obama has demanded increases in the tax rate for the top 2 % of earners , arguing that he has an electoral mandate to drive that through following the November presidential election .
But the Republicans are resisting , offering instead $ 800bn of extra revenue by closing tax loopholes and deductions .
They also want to see a more radical attack on entitlement programmes such as social security and Medicaid than the Democratic party is prepared to contemplate .
The fact that the two men met at all , and that they were clearly keen to have the fact known , is an indication of the political high stakes that are being played in the fiscal cliff game of poker .
Neither side wants to concede ground on the main negotiating points , mindful that if they do so they will have to face the angry reaction of their own party members , but nor can either political leader be seen to be negligent in trying to avoid an automatic package of $ 600bn of spending cuts and tax rises that could prove deeply unpopular with voters .
Earlier on Sunday Christine Lagarde , the head of the International Monetary Fund , urged the Democrats and Republicans to try to find a comprehensive deal to the crisis that would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax rises .
Speaking on CNN , she warned Washington that failure to act would hurt America more than anywhere else .
The US , she said , can chose to be its own best friend or worst enemy .
Failure to find a compromise would see growth collapse to zero and lead to a sharp reaction in the markets , she predicted .
There were tentative signs that some senior Republicans in Congress might be moving towards conceding on the question of tax rises for the rich in return for a robust review of entitlements .
Bob Corker , a US senator from Tennessee , told Fox News Sunday that given Obama 's recent re - election and the fact that he had campaigned on tax increases for the wealthy it might not be sensible for Republicans to resist too hard . ""
There is a growing group of folks looking at this and realising that we do n't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end , "" he said .
Signs of flexibility on the Republican side are being matched by contrast by notable inflexibility on the part of the White House on the tax rate issue .
Obama is playing a far tougher game than he did in the negotiations over the debt ceiling last summer , when he was widely criticised for having shown his hand too early ."
2012-12-12,"Republican members of Congress expressed dismay on Wednesday about the prospect of reaching a deal with the White House to resolve the fiscal cliff crisis before Christmas .
At the end of an hour - long briefing with House speaker John Boehner , Republican members were despondent leaving the meeting , complaining there has been little progress and there was nothing resembling a legitimate deal on the table on tax and spending .
In spite of the expressions of gloom about a deal , the fact that Obama and Boehner are still negotiating offers some hope of an eventual compromise .
The Republicans also appear to be less intransigent and less ideologically driven , than they were were during the 2010 and 2011 showdowns .
Boehner , who spoke to Obama on Sunday and again Tuesday , confirmed that Obama had lowered his demand for new revenue from $ 1.6tn to $ 1.4tn , but still far short of the $ 800bn the Republicans say they are willing to support .
Boehner said the $ 1.4tn could not get through the Republican - dominated House .
The Republican majority leader , Eric Cantor , who also spoke at the Republican meeting , warned members to brace themselves for staying in Washington until Christmas Eve and to return again in the week between Christmas and New Year 's Eve .
The deadline for a deal on tax and spending is January 1 .
"" We 've said we 're committed to staying here .
We 're going to stay here right up until Christmas Eve , throughout the time and period before the New Year , because we want to make sure we resolve this in an acceptable way for the American people , "" Cantor said .
What makes a deal possible is that the Republicans , in spite of all their instincts to the contrary , are willing to accept tax rises in January .
They identified the biggest sticking point as the fact that Obama was not prepared to match the tax rises with deep spending cuts .
Boehner seems to have the support of his members , something he lacked in the 2010 and 2011 showdowns , when he faced resistance and even open revolt , particularly from newly - elected members backed by the Tea Party .
The meeting was held in part to bolster that support .
Republican congressman John Campbell , from California , after leaving the meeting , said he was unimpressed by what Obama had offered so far . ""
The negotiations are nowhere .
I do not know whether our president is incapable of negotiating or is not interested in it . ""
He added : "" It is clear that in spite of the fact that they are talking , they are getting nowhere .
I have done things with the Democrats .
Tell me : what spending are they willing to cut ?
What entitlements are they prepared to cut ?
Not 10 years from now .
The taxes are going to go up in 20 days .
They are talking about spending cuts that come into effect in 20 years .
We are not going to get anywhere as long as that is their position . ""
On taxes , Campbell said : "" We hate tax increases .
We think it 's a bad idea .
But we have said ' all right , we will go there '
â€ “
but we have had no response .
The Democrats say they do not want to reform entitlements , but they will have to .
Until they go there , I do not see how this is ever going to get resolved . ""
Andy Harris , from Maryland , echoed Campbell .
"" The president still has not presented a plan .
The president wants to increase taxes and talk about spending cuts later .
That is not a plan . ""
Another Republican member of Congress , Marsha Blackburn , from Tennessee , chatting in the corridor outside the meeting , said : "" The speaker is hanging on in there .
We would like to think the president would agree to some spending cuts . """
2012-12-18,"Republicans in Congress went on the offensive over the fiscal cliff negotiations on Tuesday , threatening to unilaterally introduce a plan B before the end of the year to prevent tax rises for anyone earning less than $ 1 m a year .
The House Republicans are proposing to introduce a speedy bill that would enshrine these proposals .
The tactic , unveiled by Republican House speaker John Boehner at a press conference in Congress , is aimed at putting pressure on Barack Obama .
It would remove one of the main pieces of leverage the White House has over the Republicans : the likelihood they will be blamed if most taxpayers are hit with rises next year .
Plan B may be aimed as much at the Republican party caucus as the White House .
If a deal is reached , Boehner will be able to claim Obama caved in .
The White House press secretary , Jay Carney , responding to plan B , said Obama is not willing to accept a deal that does not ask enough of the very wealthiest in taxes .
"" The speaker 's plan B approach does n't meet this test because it ca n't pass the Senate and therefore will not protect middle class families , and does little to address our fiscal challenges with zero spending cuts .
The president is hopeful that both sides can work out remaining differences and reach a solution so we do n't miss the opportunity in front of us today . ""
The Democratic leader in the Senate , Harry Reid , echoing the White House , confirmed that there was no chance of plan B getting through the Democratic - controlled Senate .
The backwards and forwards between the White House and Congress looks like part of the traditional dance before an agreement is reached .
Obama and Boehner , who have spoken several times over the last few days , are closing in on a sweeping deal that would raises taxes on the wealthiest and implement deep cuts to federal spending programmes , including welfare .
The two met for 45 minutes on Monday and spoke by phone in the evening , suggesting a deal is in the offing .
If there is no deal in place by 1 January , all taxpayers face an automatic rise and across - the - board spending cuts will kick in .
Boehner , at the press conference , said : "" I believe it important we protect as many American tax payers as we can .
Our plan B would protect American taxpayers who make $ 1 m or less and have all of their current rates extended . ""
He added : "" I continue to have hope that we can reach a broader agreement with the White House that would reduce spending as well as have revenues on the table .
I think it would be better for our country but at this point we have a back - up plan to make sure as few American taxpayers would be affected by this increase as possible . ""
The House majority leader , Eric Cantor , also at the press conference , hinted that Boehner and Obama are close to a deal , in spite of talk of a plan B.
"" The president is not yet there .
He has not come to where he needs to be in order for us to push through a bill that really does begin to address the problem .
As the speaker said , that is why we are now discussing an alternative plan if the president and White House ca n't come our way . ""
Both Obama and Boehner have moved a long way from their original starting points .
Obama made an important concession on Monday ; having campaigned hard on raising tax for everyone earning $ 250,000 or more , he agreed in negotiations with Boehner to raise the threshold to $ 400,000 .
The president also lowered his target for the tax revenue he is seeking from $ 1.4tn to $ 1.2tn over the next 10 years and set out specific spending cuts including $ 400bn in health .
Obama also proposed to slow the growth in social security by linking payments to a less generous inflation formula , chained consumer price index ( CPI ) .
The move could mean lower payments for millions of Americans and had already drawn fire from the left . ""
The largest cuts resulting from the chained CPI would be to young , permanently disabled veterans , "" senator Bernie Sanders , Congress 's only avowed socialist , said on Twitter .
Obama held out against Republican proposals to raise the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67 .
The White House signalled that this was not Obama 's final offer .
The sticking points appear bridgeable .
Obama wants an over - arching deal that will include the debt ceiling , which is having to be raised annually and has turned into an annual White House versus Republican showdown .
Obama wants the debt ceiling removed as an issue for the next two years .
Boehner is also seeking to raise the age at which Medicare begins raised from 65 to 67 , which the White House has so far resisted .
Sean West , policy analyst at Eurasia Group , a political risk consultancy , said the latest moves looked "" like an endgame "" and that the two sides were no close enough for a deal to be done .
"" It 's very telling that Boehner 's proposal is called plan B , "" he said .
"" Boehner is in a more difficult position than Obama .
Democrats are going to fall in behind the president , he 's popular and no one wants to take him on .
Boehner is fighting two different battles .
He has to get a good deal out of Obama and he needs to convince his caucus that it really is a good deal . """
2012-12-19,"Talks over a deal to avert the fiscal cliff appear to have collapsed into a war of words , with President Obama telling Republicans in Congress to "" peel off the partisan war paint "" and a spokesman for House speaker John Boehner calling the White House 's posture "" bizarre and irrational "" .
Obama attempted to lay the blame for the lack of progress on the Republicans in the House of Representatives .
"" They keep on finding ways to say no , instead of finding ways to say yes , "" Obama told a news conference on Wednesday .
But the president said he was still optimistic that he could reach an agreement with Boehner , the speaker of the House and the Republican leader in Congress , insisting that the two sides were not that far apart .
"" I 'd like to get it done before Christmas .
There 's been a lot of posturing up on Capitol Hill instead of going ahead and getting stuff done , and we 've been wasting a lot of time , "" Obama said .
Boehner himself issued a terse response , calling on the president to back the "" plan B "" legislation being prepared by House Republicans , designed to avert looming tax increases for households earning less than $ 1 m . ""
The president will have a decision to make .
He can call on Senate and House Democrats to pass this bill .
Or he could be responsible for the biggest tax increase in American history , "" Boehner said in a 51-second statement to the media , which ended abruptly when he left without answering questions .
The tense stand - off comes after optimistic signals earlier in the week that the two sides were close to an agreement over budget cuts and revenue .
That ended on Monday evening when Boehner informed the administration that Republicans were readying their "" plan B "" .
The White House and the Democratic - controlled Senate majority bluntly rejected the Republican stopgap measure , with the White House claiming that the "" plan B "" gave away too much in tax cuts to the wealthy and pledged to veto the bill if it passed .
There has been no official contact between Obama and Boehner since then , with time running out before the automatic tax hikes and budget cuts scheduled to come into effect at the start of the new year .
Boehner 's "" plan B "" has taken a further beating from conservatives and GOP members of Congress .
Although the measure was backed by Grover Norquist 's Americans for Tax Reform , two other influential conservative lobby groups â€ “ Heritage and the Club
For Growth â€ “ condemned it for sanctioning a tax increase .
""
As leaders of broad - based American citizen groups , we call upon Republican House members to vote no on speaker Boehner 's tax hike known as ' plan B ' , "" read a letter from a coalition of conservative Republicans backed by the Club for Growth .
The president was due to leave Washington on Friday and travel to Hawaii for Christmas with his family .
But the White House says those plans have been put on hold , and that Obama will remain in he White House in an attempt to foster a deal .
In his press conference â€ “ held to announce a task force to tackle gun violence , headed by vice - president Joe Biden â€ “ Obama made a reference to the tragic events in Newtown a few days earlier , saying that the nation wanted to see politicians in Washington willing to compromise so that more pressing concerns could be dealt with .
"" If you just pull back from the immediate , you know , political battles , if you kind of peel off the partisan war paint , then we should be able to get something done , "" he said .
Earlier in the day , White House communication director Dan Pfeiffer described the Republican back - up plan as unbalanced . ""
The congressional Republican ' plan B ' legislation continues large tax cuts for the very wealthiest individuals â€ “ on average , millionaires would see a tax break of $ 50,000 â€ “ while eliminating tax cuts that 25 million students and families struggling to make ends meet depend on . ""
Pfeiffer added : "" This approach does not meet the test of balance , and the president would veto the legislation in the unlikely event of its passage . ""
In response , Boehner 's spokesman Brendan Buck said : "" The White House 's opposition to a back - up plan to ensure taxes do n't rise on American families is growing more bizarre and irrational by the day . """
2012-12-20,"A deal for the fiscal cliff , so tantalizingly close at the start of this week , has descended into name - calling and frustration . ""
Take the deal , "" instructed a clearly exasperated president to intransigent Republicans on Wednesday . ""
Irrational , "" sniffed speaker John Boehner about the president 's proposal .
Among all the people disappointed with how the fiscal cliff negotiations are playing out are those who actually negotiate for a living : corporate chieftains .
They have been wooed by Republicans and courted by Obama .
But neither side is delivering the only thing the CEOs really want : a deal .
Now .
In Corporate America , the art of making a deal is a highly orchestrated ballet , a complicated dance in which specific rhythms dictate a precise outcome .
Strategy is plotted , lawyers are called , young associates are forced to work long hours crunching numbers .
There is wooing .
There is courting .
There are dinners and spreadsheets and teams of people working together to pore over details .
If there are shouting matches and put - downs , they 're largely done in boardrooms , out of the sight of cameras .
The corporate way of making a deal is , in short , the opposite of the rambling , chaotic , time - wasting negotiations of the fiscal cliff .
The government has to come up with a budget solution by 3 January .
The president is supposed to have already left for his Hawaiian vacation , but he 's still trundling around the White House hoping for Republicans to take the deal he 's offered .
If the average corporate merger is like a mannered episode of Mad Men , where all the pain is below the surface , the fiscal cliff negotiations are like an episode of Homeland , with disasters played out very publicly .
So far , the CEOs I have talked to have responded with well - coded equanimity , expressing fervent hope that cooler heads will prevail and that an agreement is within sight .
Randall Stephenson , the CEO of AT&amp;T , who along with other CEOs with the president and Congress , said : "" I am more convinced than ever that a budget deal to avoid the ' fiscal cliff ' must and can be found . ""
Compromises on spending and taxes are part of it , he suggested .
But , in a written statement , he stressed that actually getting the negotiations off the ground would be a good start . ""
Now is the time for our nation 's leaders to put aside partisan or philosophical differences and act for the good of the country as a whole .
Failure to address this will result in severe market disruptions , a return to negative economic growth , and businesses pulling in investment .
This can and must be avoided .
It is no exaggeration to say that the future economic well - being of all Americans is riding on the outcome . ""
De - coded , that reads as a very patient reminder to Washington politicians to just what kind of consequences they 're messing with .
Tiger Tyagarajan is the CEO of technology company GenPact â€ “ a former unit of General Electric that was spun off into a public company in 2005 .
He told the Guardian : "" I am an eternal optimist and do believe that a more long - term solution will eventually be achieved .
The faster that process starts , the sooner we will get to the structural changes needed to solve for the long term ....
Now that the November US elections are behind us , there is a real opportunity for everyone to work together toward a common solution .
â€
¦
As a CEO of a global company with more than 600 clients around the world , we see that economic uncertainty and volatility is the reality of today , everywhere .
"" Translation , in part : hurry up .
Even the CEOs who are inside the process of the negotiation sound like they 've had it .
David Cote , the CEO of Honeywell , was profiled in the Wall Street Journal as the go - between for Democrats and Republicans in negotiating the issue .
The strain is beginning to show .
"" I can keep talking about a market - credible fiscal plan , "" he said , according to the paper . ""
But it 's time to say : ' You are the leaders â€ “ lead . ' ""
Ed Brodow , a negotiation expert who advises corporate leaders and the author of Negotiation Bootcamp , is not so diplomatic as those who have to answer to shareholders .
"" I think we have incompetent politicians , frankly , "" Brodow said .
"" It does n't take a genius to look at the newspaper and say : ' these people are not functioning . '
They 're not doing their job .
It requires a major look into our government , and how it 's adapting to the 21st century , because obviously there 's a problem . ""
The chief failing in the fiscal cliff talks , Brodow said , is that Republicans and the White House have failed to "" transcend the adversarial nature of negotiation and turn it into a collaboration "" .
Instead , he noted , there 's been too much digging in . ""
No one wants to appear to be soft on this .
They all want to show they 're tough .
One side wants to maintain higher taxes , the other side wants to cut expenditures .
Neither side will give .
The only way this will happen is if they both sit down and say , we agree on the objective , which is to avoid the fiscal cliff .
To do that , we can make concessions , so let 's brainstorm ideas to do that . ""
But , he despaired , "" It 's not in their DNA . """
2012-12-21,"The Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , John Boehner , has signalled that he is not planning to quit after a congressional debacle that left negotiations over US debt and spending in chaos and brought closer the prospect of the country falling over the "" fiscal cliff "" on 1 January .
With house members having left Washington on Thursday night for Christmas and senators scheduled to leave Friday afternoon , the prospect of a deal before the deadline appeared bleak .
Boehner , speaking at a press conference on Friday morning regarding how a deal could be found , summed up the mood in Washington .
"" How we get there ?
God only knows , "" he said .
The Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell , to whom Boehner shifted responsibility for finding a deal , made an opening bid , suggesting the Senate take up a bill that has already passed the House that would extend for another year the present tax breaks for everyone that were introduced during the presidency of George W Bush .
The proposal will not fly for the Democrats , but at least it is the start of a process .
Until now , McConnell has shown little interest in becoming involved in the negotiations .
McConnell proposed the House bill as a starting point to which the Democrats could introduce amendments and differences between the House and Senate versions be hammered out .
"" It 's called legislating , folks , "" McConnell said .
"" It 's what Congress used to do . ""
News of the breakdown of talks triggered a sell off on the US stock markets on Friday , with the Dow Industrial Average falling by more than 160 points before noon .
Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank , said more sell - offs would come until a deal was done . ""
Everyday that there is n't an agreement will be a drag on the economy , "" he said .
The swift change in mood contrasts with earlier this week , when President Barack Obama and Boehner had been closing in on a deal that would have raised taxes and cut spending .
But Democrats and Republicans now appear further away from a deal than they did a month ago , after a stunning reversal in congress on Thursday night .
Boehner 's credibility and authority as speaker are on the line , after he failed to push through a Republican bill aimed offering a short - term fix .
He had to withdraw it when he was confronted by a revolt from mainly Tea Party - backed Republicans , who were unwilling to countenance any tax rise .
Although he denied on Friday he was washing his hands of the whole issue and said that he would continue talking to Obama , Boehner effectively abandoned the talks process by saying it was not up to the Senate and the White House , rather than the House of Representatives , to come up with a solution .
Sean West , a policy analyst at Eurasia Group , a political risk consultancy , said the breakdown meant the US was "" in a different world than it was earlier this week "" .
"" This is the end of the second act , "" he said .
"" Boehner has far less options than he did and it certainly increases the risk that a deal wo n't be done .
That said we still believe the likelihood is that a solution will be found .
"" This is the latest in a number of showdowns between the White House and Congress during Obama 's presidency .
What stunned Washington on Thursday night was that the failure of Boehner 's "" Plan B "" represented a dramatic break from the familiar pattern of political to - ing and fro - ing that eventually ends in a deal .
It showed that if Boehner can not control his own members , the chances of him securing a deal seem slim .
Boehner faces an election for speaker early in January , when the new congress convenes .
What should have been a relatively straightforward vote now looks one that could be risky for him .
He could face a challenge from the Tea Party wing of the Republican party , with Eric Cantor , the majority leader in the house , waiting in the wings to take over .
Asked at the press conference if he was concerned about his job , Boehner said : "" No , I 'm not .
Listen , you 've all heard me say this
and I 've told my colleagues the same thing .
If you do the right things every day for the right reasons , the right things happen . ""
Boehner insisted that the revolt had not been aimed at undermining him , but instead reflected concern among some Republicans about going against their principles and voting for a perceived tax rise .
"" There a was a perception created that that vote last night was going increase taxes , "" he said .
"" Now I disagreed with that characterisation of the bill , but that impression was out there .
We had a number of our members who just did not want to be perceived as having raised taxes .
That was the real issue .
"" What made the debate such a humiliation for Boehner was that it was a purely Republican one .
The so - called Plan B bill would have limited tax rises in January just to those earning $ 1 m or more a year .
Democrats were opposed , wanting the rises to kick in at $ 250,000 or even , as Obama proposed , $ 400,000 .
Cantor , who led a revolt against Boehner in the summer of 2011 , during another showdown with the White House over the federal debt ceiling , was onside this time and faced humiliation of his own when he had confidently predicted that the Republicans had the numbers to get the bill through .
Boehner further tied him in by bringing him along to the press conference on Friday .
Another potential loser in the debacle was the Republican congressman Paul Ryan , Mitt Romney 's presidential running - mate , whose backing for the bill will have cost him right - wing support .
One of Obama 's main advisers , David Axelrod , interviewed on MSNBC , said : "" The fact that they could n't even pass that [ ' Plan B']was an embarrassment . ""
He added : "" Hopefully over the weekend the speaker , the leadership will think that through and come back and be ready to negotiate seriously and move forward . """
2012-12-21,"The standoff between the White House and Congress over the ' fiscal cliff ' turned into a full - blown crisis on Thursday night when Republican House Speaker John Boehner was publicly humiliated , unable to command enough support to secure passage of his own bill .
Boehner had planned to push through the Republican - dominated House a bill that would have seen tax rises curbed for those earning $ 1 m a year or less .
But he was forced to withdraw it in the face of a Republican revolt , with Tea Party - backed members unable to stomach the prospect of voting for any tax rise , even for those earning $ 1 m or more .
Only hours earlier , his team had been confidently predicting it had enough Republican votes to get the bill through .
But as the time for the vote neared , it became clear he did not have sufficient votes and called an emergency meeting .
Boehner was unable to win over the rebels .
Afterwards he announced passage of the bill had been abandoned . ""
The House did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass , "" Boehner said .
The White House press secretary , Jay Carney , responding to the House debacle , issued a statement saying : "" The president 's main priority is to ensure that taxes do n't go up on 98 % of Americans and 97 % of small businesses in just a few short days .
"" The president will work with Congress to get this done and we are hopeful that we will be able to find a bipartisan solution quickly . ""
The problem is that Obama no longer has a partner on the Republican side to reach a deal with , with Boehner having lost support .
The onus will now be on the Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell , to come forward to try to stitch up a deal as he has so often in the past , though he shown no appetite for getting involved up until now .
Earlier in the week , a deal had appeared close , with Boehner and Barack Obama thrashing out the details face - to - face and on the phone .
But that effort has now ground to a halt .
If Boehner can not control his own Republican party , it is difficult to see how a deal is going to be reached before 1 January .
Without an agreement by 1 January , every taxpayer in America will face a rise .
Automatic cuts in federal spending will also kick in .
The bill Boehner had been proposing to pass , the so - called ' Plan B ' , was primarily tactical , with no chance of ever becoming legislation .
The Democratic - controlled Senate would have killed it and , on the remote chance of it making it out of Congress , Obama said he would veto it .
The main aim of the ' Plan B ' bill was to provide some cover for the Republicans so they would not get all of the blame if taxes go up .
The Republicans and Obama are at odds over the scale of taxation and spending cuts .
Obama wants tax rises to start at $ 400,000 , not the Republicans ' proposed $ 1 m .
Obama has offered $ 800bn in spending cuts but the Republicans are seeking $ 1.2tn .
Both the House and the Senate now look set to head off on holiday on Friday with no deal in place .
Having failed to get even a symbolic bill through , Boehner handed over responsibility to resolving the crisis to the Democrats , both Obama and the Senate leader Harry Reid . ""
Now it is up to the president to work with senator Reid on legislation to avert the fiscal cliff , "" Boehner said .
The problem is that if the Senate passes a bill that would see taxes rise for those earning $ 400,000 and above , the Republican - controlled House will kill it .
The standoff is almost a rerun of a similar one in spring and summer 2011 when Boehner and Obama almost reached a deal on resolving the debt crisis but it had to be abandoned after Boehner faced a revolt .
Much of the Republican opposition is down to ideological distaste for voting for any tax rise .
If the country goes over the fiscal cliff on 1 January , as seems increasingly likely , and every taxpayer sees a rise , there might then be a way out .
Ideological Republicans could then vote for a Democratic bill to reverse most of the tax rises , at least for those earning $ 400,000 a year or less .
Boehner faces re - election as Speaker next year
but this debacle leaves a question over whether he commands enough loyalty in the Republican ranks any longer to make that a foregone conclusion .

2012-12-21,"Just as during the Cuban Missile crisis of 50 years ago , the world is watching anxiously as the politicians in Washington try to prevent the US economy from plunging off the fiscal cliff .
The stakes could never be as high as they were when Khrushchev and Kennedy were on the hot line in October 1962 , but there would be serious consequences were the talks between President Obama and John Boehner , the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives to end in failure .
George Osborne is just one of the finance ministers keen to see the impasse ended .
The latest news from the UK economy was disappointing , even if there were one or two bright spots .
Growth in the third quarter was less strong than originally believed at 0.9 % while a year in which the economy has stagnated has taken its toll of the public finances .
Once all the special factors were stripped out , the deficit was 10 % higher in the first eight months of the 2012 - 13 financial year than in the same months of 2011 - 12 .
What the hard data and the survey evidence show is that it will be touch and go whether Britain has a triple - dip recession this winter .
At the moment , the odds are slightly against a further two consecutive quarters of declining GDP but that would go out of the window if more than $ 600bn ( Â£370bn ) of tax increases and spending cuts are triggered in the US on 1 January .
Officials in Washington have calculated that the budget tightening involved would wipe out all the expected growth in the US economy next year and result in a 0.5 % contraction instead .
Despite the rapid growth of China , the US is still the world 's biggest economy and accounts for one fifth of global output .
A recession there in 2013 would lead to much slower growth in China , intensify the downturns in Japan and the eurozone , and make a triple dip in Britain a nailed - on certainty .
Both sides in the Washington talks know the risks .
Markets have started to fray at the edges in recent days as hopes have been dashed that a deal would be signed before Christmas .
The expectation is that just as in 1962 mutual assured destruction will be avoided , and it probably will be .
But time is getting short and damage â€ “ in the form of delayed investment decisions and the blow to consumer confidence â€ “ is already being caused .
In its current state , it is damage the global economy could do without ."

"" I 've spent my whole life chasing the American dream , "" Boehner said in 2010 , tears welling , before becoming speaker of the House of Representatives .
He seemed destined for grandeur , perhaps even greatness .
On Thursday night , as cold winds gusted through Washington , the 63-year - old Republican had reason to tear up again .
A revolt in his own party killed a tax bill which Boehner had championed as a solution to the fiscal cliff .
He failed to tame Tea party - linked colleagues and stood not as a representative of the American dream but of Washington 's dysfunction .
Instead of being hailed as a shrewd tactician who could bridge the ideological divide and steer Republicans to a historic accommodation with Democrats , and thus avert economic disaster , he found himself pilloried as the architect of debacle .
"" I 've never seen anything like it where leadership just completely backed down , "" Colorado representative Mike Coffman told The Hill .
An unnamed GOP insider gave a saltier verdict to the Atlantic 's Molly Ball . ""
He just lost the respect of the caucus .

The stakes could hardly be higher .
Without an agreement by 1 January , every taxpayer in America will face a rise .
Automatic cuts in federal spending will also kick in , risking , say many economists , a return to recession .
Boehner proposed the so - called ' plan B ' to rally the Republican - dominated House around a bill curbing tax rises for those earning $ 1 m a year or less .
The Democratic - controlled Senate and President Barack Obama would have killed it , arguing the rich would need to pay more , but the bill could have kept Republicans in the game and negotiations on track .
The speaker was confident of marshalling his troops behind the bill but Tea Party - backed members balked , unable to stomach any tax rise .
At the eleventh hour a "" distraught "" Boehner recited the Serenity Prayer and admitted defeat at a closed - door meeting of Republicans .
Later , he broke the news to the nation . ""
The House did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass . ""
US stock markets tumbled on Friday and the rest of the world blanched at the prospect of the US falling over the fiscal cliff .
All eyes will now be on Obama and Senate leaders Harry Reid , a Democrat , and Mitch McConnell , a Republican , as they try to avert fiasco .
Whether they succeed or not , Washington is now asking how Boehner got into this mess , and whether he can survive as speaker .
There is talk of overthrow .
It is a precipitate fall for a boy from humble origins who climbed fast and high .
Of German - Irish stock , he was the second born of 12 children .
The family home had just two bedrooms .
When the bathroom was occupied the boys used to pee by a tree .
Boehner , a linebacker on the school football team , graduated in 1977 with a business administration degree from Xavier university .
He joined Nucite Sales , a packaging and plastics firm , and worked his way up to be president .
The conservative Catholic , married with two daughters , was elected to the town board , then the state capitol before heading to Washington in 1991 as the US representative from Ohio 's 8th congressional district .
Boehner proved to be an old - fashioned congressional politician , friendly with Democrats and used to doing bipartisan deals .
He called the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act , co - authored with Ted Kennedy , his proudest achievement .
As a lieutenant to Newt Gingrich he rose up congressional ranks , becoming an increasingly visible fixture during the Clinton and Bush presidencies .
Critics called him a lackey for lobbyists , especially the tobacco industry , and after becoming speaker the attacks intensified .
Obama depicted him as a golf - loving friend of plutocrats and mocked his perpetual tan .
Late - night comedians called him the "" sprinkler of the House "" for a tendency to cry in public .
"" It is cold down in Washington , DC .
They had to use an ice scraper on John Boehner 's face to get the tears off , it was so cold , "" David Letterman joked on the Late Show .
Even so , Democrats respected him as a pragmatist .
"" We have different political views but have a good personal relationship , "" Nancy Pelosi has said .
His problem was that the 2010 mid - term elections brought in a wave of Tea party radicals .
He has tried â€ “ and failed â€ “ to control them .
During a stand - off last year over raising the federal debt limit Boehner managed an agreement with Obama , the so - called "" grand bargain "" , but when he went back to his own party , he faced opposition led by Eric Cantor , the House majority leader .
This time around it seemed Boehner would pull it off .
He purged radicals from prized committee positions and lined up Cantor and other fiscal hawks such as Paul Ryan and Grover Norquist on side .
On the nightly news he would stride confidently in and out of meetings , seemingly in control .
No longer an enigma , ordinary Americans learned to pronounce his name ( Bay - ner ) .
And then , on Thursday night , it all fell apart .
Boehner in effect admitted powerlessness . ""
Now it is up to the president to work with senator Reid on legislation to avert the fiscal cliff , "" he said .
Resolving the fiscal mess , he suggested , may require divine intervention .

If there was any sign of a deal , Obama would have delayed his holiday .
His departure comes after the debacle in the House of Representatives on Thursday when the Republican Speaker John Boehner was humiliated by his own members , who rebelled against his proposed plan .
Boehner signalled on Friday he was not planning to quit as Speaker but he has been left wounded .
The debacle brought closer the prospect of the country falling over the "" fiscal cliff "" on 1 January , with all taxpayers facing a rise and automatic cuts in federal spending , from defence to welfare , kicking in .
The House left for holidays on Thursday night and the Senate on Friday .
Obama 's holiday has been an on - off affair .
With the election behind him , he had scheduled a long break , beginning on Friday , but last week the White House indicated he was unlikely to leave until the crisis had been resolved .
The White House on Friday announced that there had been another change and he was leaving after all .
In a statement , Obama suggested he would be back in Washington next week , much earlier than he had planned and expressed optimism that a deal could still be reached before the new year . ""
So , as we leave town for a few days to be with our families for the holidays , I hope it gives everybody some perspective .
Everybody can cool off ; everybody can drink some eggnog , have some Christmas cookies , sing some Christmas carols , enjoy the company of loved ones , "" he said .
"" And then I 'd ask every member of Congress while they 're back home to think about that .
Think about the obligations we have to the people who sent us here .
Think about the hardship that so many Americans will endure if Congress does nothing at all . ""

And with that , I want to wish every American a merry Christmas .
And because we did n't get this done , I will see you next week .

Republican speaker John Boehner said the House will reconvene on Sunday evening , with less than 30 hours until the US reaches the fiscal cliff deadline .
Boehner warned politicians they may be working through next Friday â€ “ after the 31 December deadline â€ “ to reach a deal to avert massive tax hikes and spending cuts .
The decision to call House members back came after fierce criticism from Democrat Senate leader Harry Reid , who earlier in the day had accused Republicans of "" watching movies "" while the budget crisis deepened .
Obama arrived in Washington on Thursday after cutting short his Christmas vacation to Hawaii , and the Senate also returned to work .
But even as talks appeared to be grinding back into motion , there were few signs that a breakthrough was imminent .

"" I have to be honest : I do n't know , time - wise , how it can happen , "" Reid added .
"" I would hope that the speaker and the Republican leader here in the Senate would come to us and say : here 's what we think will work . ""
In a call with colleagues , Boehner told House Republicans that he was "" not interested "" in passing a fiscal cliff deal with "" mostly Democrat votes , "" according to Politico .
Reid 's gloomy acknowledgement of the failure of bipartisan negotiations triggered a sell - off on US stock markets .
All the major US markets ended the day down .
The Dow Jones closed down slightly for its fourth consecutive day of losses .
The slip came as the latest survey of consumer confidence by the Conference Board showed a sharp drop to 65.1 in December , from a revised 71.5 in November
that the thinktank blamed on uncertainty caused by the budget crisis .
On Wednesday , before boarding his plane , Obama had telephone discussions with Reid , Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell , Boehner , and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi .
A spokesman for Boehner said in a statement : "" Senator Reid should talk less and legislate more .
The House has already passed legislation to avoid [ going over ] the entire fiscal cliff .
Senate Democrats have not . """
2013-01-02,"It 's rare for the top two members of the House leadership to split on an important vote .
Bob Michel , the hapless leader of the House Republicans during a long period in the minority , and Newt Gingrich voted differently on the 1990 "" read my lips "" tax increase .
They split again over the 1994 assault weapons ban .
Even less common is a House speaker and majority leader going their separate ways on big - ticket legislation .
The last major example is when the Democratic - controlled House debated funding President George W Bush 's surge in Iraq .
House speaker Nancy Pelosi allowed the measure to proceed to the floor and voted no .
House majority leader Steny Hoyer voted yes .
House speakers typically do n't even vote at all unless it is necessary to break a tie .
So it may have been a clarifying moment when speaker of the House John Boehner and House majority leader Eric Cantor parted ways on the deal that ended the long national nightmare known as the fiscal cliff .
Boehner voted for the bipartisan agreement negotiated between Vice - President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ; Cantor breathed the final moments of life into the opposition .
In fact , the House Republican leadership team split right down the middle on the legislation .
House majority whip Kevin McCarthy voted against ; House Republican conference chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers sided with Boehner and voted in favor .
When Pelosi and Hoyer disagreed on the surge , it was the speaker who sided with the majority of her caucus .
House conservatives have increasingly chafed under Boehner 's leadership .
Four independent - minded fiscal conservatives â€ “ Justin Amash of Michigan , Tim Huelskamp of Kansas , Walter Jones of North Carolina , and David Schweikert of Arizona
â€ “ were purged from their preferred committee assignments for their unpredictable voting behavior .
Secret "" scorecards "" were allegedly used in making the decision , though this has been denied publicly .
Conservatives helped defeat Boehner 's "" Plan B "" compromise on the fiscal cliff before Christmas .
The problem is that House Republicans are stifled by a Democratic Senate and president .
Many of them hail from safe , conservative districts .
A critical mass were elected in 2010 with high hopes for cutting government spending .
Boehner 's efforts to work within these constraints have not endeared him to some restless Republicans .
Enter Eric Cantor .
In closed - door meetings of the House Republican conference , he expressed his opposition to the Senate bill before Boehner had taken a stand .
He expressed the sense of most Republicans that it raised taxes without getting any meaningful spending cuts in return , that it added to the deficit , and that it created the precedent that any cuts must be paired with tax hikes .
President Obama 's team released a statement that morning suggesting they agreed with that last point , practically singing , "" Ding - dong , Grover Norquist 's dead . ""
Cantor had tried to establish himself as the right flank of the debt ceiling negotiations in the summer of 2011 , famously irritating the president .
But many conservatives regarded this as ambition talking more than principle .
When the majority leader said out loud what most Republicans were thinking about the fiscal cliff bill , however , there was admiration .
As reports of the meeting leaked out , observers began to wonder if a Cantor coup against Boehner was brewing .
Cantor 's spokesman , Doug Heye , took to Twitter to quell the rumors : Majority Leader Cantor stands with @speakerboehner .
Speculation otherwise is silly , non - productive and untrue .
â€
” Doug Heye ( @DougHeye )
January 1 , 2013
Six hours later , Boehner and Cantor took opposite positions in the roll call vote .
Could Cantor make a move ?
The conditions are there , but an exhausted Republican caucus may ultimately flinch from a change at such an uncertain time .
And if Cantor does n't run , it 's hard to see anyone else mustering the votes to oust Boehner .
Boehner also has a strong case to make .
When Obama was re - elected , Republicans lost much of their leverage .
That immediately set up a conflict between the spending cuts they hoped they were getting when they negotiated the debt ceiling deal in August and the Bush tax cuts that were always set to expire at the end of the year .
Those spending cuts did n't really materialize â€ “ at least , not to the extent Republicans had hoped â€ “ and the top income tax rate is going up .
( So are payroll taxes , though there did n't seem to be a strong constituency in either party for resisting that regressive tax hike . )
But when the dust settles , House Republicans avoided being held responsible for an across - the - board tax increase , gave up substantially less revenue than Obama demanded , and most of them did n't even end up having to vote for the increase on the top earners .
Nearly all rising stars and strong conservatives in the House â€ “ with the exception of Paul Ryan , who supported his ally Boehner by voting for the deal â€ “ were spared .
It has n't been pretty and it has n't yielded significant conservative reforms , but Boehner has averted government shutdowns , a default , and the fiscal cliff under seemingly impossible odds .
House Republicans live to fight another day , possibly as soon as the next debt ceiling extension .
All that has to count for something .
But Cantor does n't have to vie for the top job now .
More than four years passed between when Gingrich led the revolt against the 1990 tax increase and when he took over the leadership from Michel , who dutifully supported his president in raising taxes .
For now , the leadership has covered all its bases , with key members able to tell rank - and - file Republicans they took both positions on the deal .
But even with the gavel , Boehner is in for a wild ride ."
2013-01-02,"And finally : it looks like John Boehner is probably safe as speaker .
The Atlantic 's Molly Ball analyses Chris Christie 's blunt attack on House Republicans â€ “
especially John Boehner â€ “ today :
As with Christie 's buddy act with President Obama during Sandy -- which sent his approval rating soaring to 72 % even as it drove to distraction the Mitt Romney presidential campaign
â€
“ Christie 's emotional diatribe seemed both utterly authentic and politically brilliant .
There 's basically zero political downside in campaigning against Congress , and particularly the House GOP , right now : As of a couple of weeks ago , before the current debacle , just 25 % of Americans approved of congressional Republicans ' performance , while 70 % disapproved .
And what does it all mean for Christie 's re - election , and any possible presidential ambitions ?
Christie is up for reelection this year in his very blue home state , and by turning his legendary temper on the GOP , he 's helped turned his image from partisan ball - buster to nobly apolitical , equal - opportunity ball - buster .
Has he damaged his stock as a Republican presidential candidate by going after his own party ?
Possibly .
But it 's hard these days to find even Republicans who will defend what 's been going on in the House
Meanwhile , from the fiscal cliff to the debt ceiling
â€ “ ceiling are less scary than cliffs , you 'd imagine â€ “ and credit rating agency
Moody 's is making warning sounds already :
Although Moody 's believes that the debt limit will eventually be raised and that the risk of default on Treasury bonds is extremely low , this confluence of events adds uncertainty to the outcome of negotiations .
However , the spending measures that result from the negotiations will form part of the medium - term outlook for the budget deficit .
Moody 's will need to consider these measures in assessing the rating outlook .
Further revenue measures may also form part of the negotiations .
The debt trajectory resulting from this process is likely to determine whether the Aaa rating is returned to a stable outlook or downgraded to Aa1 , as Moody 's stated last September .
After a day of being slapped in the face repeatedly , the Speaker of the House finally puts out a statement on Sandy relief funding : House Speaker John Boehner ( R - OH ) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) released the following statement regarding the requested funding for victims of Hurricane Sandy : Getting critical aid to the victims of Hurricane Sandy should be the first priority in the new Congress , and that was reaffirmed today with members of the New York and New Jersey delegations .
The House will vote Friday to direct needed resources to the National Flood Insurance Program .
And on January 15th , the first full legislative day of the 113th Congress , the House will consider the remaining supplemental request for the victims of Hurricane Sandy .
So it 's the first priority of the new Congress but the last priority of the current one ?
All the New Jersey / New York complaints over Sandy relief seems to have had an effect â€ “ not only has a new vote been scheduled for Friday â€ “ or $ 9bn to re - up the flood insurance programme â€ “ and another later in the month , for a combined $ 60bn in total , a big advance on the $ 27bn that House Republicans were talking about previously .
Smooth move , tri - state area .
Magnificent piece of work by the National Journal , detailing how John Boehner 's plans to exploit the fiscal cliff unraveled , showing Boehner to be a ham - fisted political operator : In the end , despite all the planning and forethought , Boehner would stand almost helplessly by as the nation plunged off the fiscal cliff and a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and centrist Republicans voted to give Obama the big tax hikes he demanded on the wealthy .
House Republicans saw the worst of all worlds : They failed to save tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans , put no new checks on government spending , and showed themselves a fractious and disorganized opposition party , the governance of which in the new Congress will prove to be a serious test .
Democrats must be happy to see Boehner re - elected .
And why not ?
It sounds like there has been rapid movement behind the scenes and now a bunch of Republican members from the areas affected by Sandy are holding a press conferences saying what a great guy John Boehner is , and they plan to vote for him for speaker .
They include Michael Grimm and Pete King , who have been fulminating all day about Boehner and the decision to pull the vote on Sandy relief .
It unusual to see even members of Congress do such gymnastics in such a short time , and King in particular must be a contender for the USA Olympic team after his gyrations here : As far as I 'm concerned , that was a lifetime ago ... to me there 's no reason to question what happened before .
So three hours is a lifetime ago ?
To quote Chris Christie , this is why people hate Congress .
According to AP 's GOP sources , Boehner has assured members that a vote on Sandy aid will be held by 15 January .
And it seems that on Friday there will be a vote on a Sandy insurance bill worth $ 9bn .
Here 's a statement just issued by the International Monetary Fund on the fiscal cliff legislation â€ “ and the IMF wants the debt ceiling raised "" expeditiously "" : We welcome the action by the US Congress to avoid sudden tax increases and spending cuts , including through an extension of unemployment benefits during 2013 .
In the absence of Congressional action the economic recovery would have been derailed .
However , more remains to be done to put US public finances back on a sustainable path without harming the still fragile recovery .
Specifically , a comprehensive plan that ensures both higher revenues and containment of entitlement spending over the medium term should be approved as soon as possible .
In addition , it is crucial to raise the debt ceiling expeditiously and remove remaining uncertainties about the spending sequester and expiring appropriation bills .
Here 's video of Chris Christie 's press conference
this afternoon â€ “
it 's well worth watching .
John Boehner death spiral : when details like this start getting into the public domain â€ “ and they are taken seriously .
AP has another entry in the John Boehner re - election / loser campaign as Speaker of the House : A House Republican leadership aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the aide was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly , said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was ready to have the House vote on the bill and was surprised when the Speaker made the decision late Tuesday to let it die for this session of Congress , which ends Thursday .
Now who would have leaked something like that ?
Surprise !
Now this playing hardball .
Asked if he would campaign against Republicans who stopped the Sandy aid bill , Chris Christie replies : We 'll see .
Primaries are an ugly thing .
Fighting talk .
Or rather , fighting veiled threat .
Although Republican primary voters in Ohio might not take kindly to Christie showing up and telling them who to vote for .
Chris Christie in full sail is an awesome sight â€ “ and possibly terrifying if you 're John Boehner , being railed upon : We 've got people down there who use the citizens of this country as the pawns on a chessboard .
Our people were played last night as a pawn .
That 's why people hate Washington DC .
Last night , my party was responsible for this .
Asked if Boehner should be re - elected as speaker , Christie says : I 'm not a member of the House , I do n't get a vote .
I do n't care .
Ouch .
But Christie offers Boehner a second chance : "" No one is beyond redemption , "" he says .
"" Do your job . ""
Chris Christie is still going , and it feels like John Boehner 's grip on the House speakership is slipping with every comment .
Such as : If the people of New Jersey feel betrayed by what happens last night , then they have good company , I 'm with them .
Asked about Pete King 's comment about not fundraising for Republican candidates , Christie says he 'd more discriminating :
Certainly at the moment I would n't be looking to do much for House leadership .
Quite why CNN has cut away from the Christie press conference , god only knows .
It 's brilliant television .
New Jersey 's Republican governor Chris Christie is pulling few punches in his press conference addressing the failure of the House of Representatives to pass legislation providing disaster relief to the victims of Superstorm Sandy : There 's only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims
â€ “ the House majority and their speaker , John Boehner .
"" For me , it was disappointing and disgusting to watch , "" Christie says of the decision by John Boehner to drop plans for a vote on the bill :
Last night the House of Representatives failed that most basic test of public service ...
this should be a no - brainer for the House Republicans .
Christie blames "" the toxic internal politics of the House Republicans "" of the failure to pass a relief bill , calling it selfish and duplicitous . ""
Sixty - six days and counting , shame on you , shame on Congress , "" he says .
He 's not holding back , making sure everyone knows that it was Boehner 's move :
All I can tell you is that this was the Speaker 's decision , his alone .
Christie is clearly angry , when asked what explanation he was given for the move by the Republican leader in the House : I was given no explanation , I was called at 11.20 last night by leader [ Eric ] Cantor and told that authority for the vote was pulled by the Speaker .
And our delegation asked for a meeting with the Speaker at that time , they were refused .
I called the Speaker four times last night after 11.20 and he did not take my calls .
So you 'll have to ask the Speaker .
In answer to a question about his conversations with Boehner , Christie says : I wo n't get into my conversation with the Speaker , but I will tell you there 's no reason to believe anything they say ....
There is no reason for me to believe any of the stuff they 've been telling me , because they have been telling me stuff for weeks .
New Jersey governor Chris Christie has a press conference to talk about the Sandy relief bill that died in Congress lat night , at 2 pm ET .
That should be interesting .
Also worth noting : the current House of Representatives reconvenes at 11 am tomorrow , giving it exactly one hour to pass something before the 113th Congress comes into being .
So maybe .
Despite a slapstick run of prat falls and collapses , it seems that the only thing that is going to save John Boehner as speaker of the House is the lack of alternatives within the Republican party itself .
The speakership has become something of a poisoned chalice for Republicans , with the divisions with the GOP caucus making it an impossible job .
The National Journal reports that there simply are no takers : Successful rebellions require leaders .
Thatâ€ ™ s why the recent talk about some House conservatives conniving to wrest the speakerâ€ ™ s gavel from John Boehner now appears headed nowhere â€ “ and why even Boehnerâ€ ™ s detractors say that he will be reelected when the new Congress convenes on Thursday .
â€œYou
canâ€
™ t beat somebody with nobody , â€ �
one senior House Republican said on Tuesday , referring to what has turned out to be skittishness of any viable alternative candidate to step forward , from the shadows or anywhere else .
Through the magic of the internet , President Obama has done a video address on the subject of the fiscal cliff , which has just been posted .
On the floor of the Senate , Harry Reid is pulling out John Boehner 's finger nails , very slowly and carefully , castigating the House 's failure to vote on a Sandy relief bill and a number of other moral and political failings .
More in sorrow than in anger , Reid concludes : Unlike others in this capital I 'm not going to stoop to name - calling .
Ah , that would be a reference to this :
House Speaker John Boehner couldnâ€ ™ t hold back when he spotted Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in the White House lobby last Friday ....
â€œGo fâ€ ” yourself , â€ �
Boehner sniped as he pointed his finger at Reid , according to multiple sources present .
Reid , a bit startled , replied : â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ �
Boehner repeated :
â€œGo fâ€ ”
yourself.â€
�
Revenge is a dish best served cold , as legitimate businessmen involved in Las Vegas casinos used to say .
Now the speaker 's office announces that John Boehner will meet with members of the House of Representatives about the Sandy bill at 3 pm this afternoon , and says that passage of the bill will be the "" first priority "" for the new Congress .
Meanwhile , the Senate has reconvened â€ “ surprisingly â€ “ and Democratic leader Harry Reid is going to twist the knife from the floor of the chamber , one imagines .
True fact : Harry Reid today becomes the longest - serving Nevadan in US Congress , having been there as an elected representative for 10,957 days .
To celebrate , here are The Killers singing the Nevada state song , Home Means Nevada , at a rally for Reid
It 's a terrible song , no matter who sings it .
To pile on the pressure on Republicans in Congress , New Jersey governor Chris Christie and New York governor Andrew Cuomo issue a sternly - worded joint statement : With all that New York and New Jersey and our millions of residents and small businesses have suffered and endured , this continued inaction and indifference by the House of Representatives is inexcusable .
It has now been 66 days since Hurricane Sandy hit and 27 days since President Obama put forth a responsible aid proposal that passed with a bipartisan vote in the Senate while the House has failed to even bring it to the floor .
This failure to come to the aid of Americans following a severe and devastating natural disaster is unprecedented .
The fact that days continue to go by while people suffer , families are out of their homes , and men and women remain jobless and struggling during these harsh winter months is a dereliction of duty .
When American citizens are in need we come to their aid .
That tradition was abandoned in the House last night .
The people of our states can no long afford to wait while politicians in Washington play games .
By way of background : the Senate approved a $ 60bn bill on Friday to aid recovery .
The House appropriations committee has drafted a smaller $ 27bn bill , and a vote had been expected .
Speaker John Boehner then killed a vote last night , in the fallout from the fiscal cliff legislation .
President Obama joins the call for action over last night 's disaster relief bill stymied in Congress .
Just off his flight to Hawaii , Obama issues a call for the House of Representatives to pass the bill for Superstorm Sandy relief funds today :
The Senate passed this request with bipartisan support .
But the House of Representatives has refused to act , even as there are families and communities who still need our help to rebuild in the months and years ahead and who also still need immediate support with the bulk of winter still in front of us .
When tragedy strikes , Americans come together to support those in need .
I urge Republicans in the House of Representatives to do the same , bring this important request to a vote today , and pass it without delay for our fellow Americans .
In case you missed it , here 's the tweet that will live on in infamy , sent at 5 pm last night by Doug Heye , House majority leader Eric Cantorâ€ ™ s deputy chief of staff : A few hours later , Cantor voted against the fiscal cliff bill .
Like Grover Norquist 's "" tax - increases are the new tax - cuts "" doublespeak , we have Eric Cantor 's "" stands - with is the new stabs - in - the - back "" .
Erick Erickson , editor of the influential conservative site RedState , is deeply unhappy at the antics of the turncoat leaders of the Republican side in the House , majority leader Eric Cantor and chief whip Kevin McCarthy .
Saying that the House Republicans really are in disarray , Erickson lashes Cantor and McCarthy for duplicity in telling their comrades to do one thng and then doing another themselves :
Further reports began circulating that Eric Cantor and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy were pushing Republicans to support the deal .
Then it all turned south as the vote was being held .
Speaker John Boehner , in a highly unusual move ( maybe he saw Lincoln ) decided to vote on the legislation and voted for it .
But Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy both voted no after pushing Republicans to vote for it .
This was opportunism , not courage .
They were yet again trying to put distance between then and the Speaker , after all the media stories of a week ago that Eric Cantor and John Boehner were united .
Erickson 's right .
Maybe Boehner needs to sack Cantor and McCarthy ?
The man behind the Republican party 's tax - allergy , Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform , issued a masterpiece in political malleability in one tweet last night : This is trivially true : Norquist uncharacteristically ignores the fact that even by his own overly - legalistic standard , taxes did go up on higher income earners .
Anyway , keeping with Norquist 's logic , almost two - thirds of the House Republicans who voted against the bill must have been voting for a tax rise .
Let 's assume that Americans for Tax Reform 's next ratings for individual members of Congress are going to be very confused .
The uproar continues over John Boehner 's decision not proceed with a bill offering billions in emergency relief to the areas hit by Superstorm Sandy .
After the fiscal cliff vote last night , Boehner chose to yank a planned vote on the relief bill , despite protests from members of his own party .
Now , outspoken Republican congressman Peter King of New York has gone ballistic , telling CNN that the Republican leadership are "" writing off New York , theyâ€ ™ re writing off New Jersey "" : King then threatened to hit the GOP where it hurts â€ “ its wallet :
They raised millions of dollars in New York City and New Jersey , they sent Governor Christie around the country raising millions of dollars for them .
Iâ€ ™ m saying ,
anyone from New York and New Jersey who gives one penny to the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee should have their head examined .
That 's King 's own party he 's talking about there .
Then there was this exchange : Victor Blackwell : Would it be fair to interpret that as you have not yet decided if you will vote to elect John Boehner as speaker in the 113th Congress ?
Peter King : As far as I 'm concerned , my world turned upside down last night , so I am right now holding every vote in abeyance .
Blackwell :
Have you spoken to the speaker 's office to find out why this did not come up for a vote ?
King :
I was chasing the speaker all over the House floor last night trying to talk to him and his staff , and he kept telling me wait until the vote is over .
Wait until the fiscal cliff vote is over .
Everything will be taken care of .
And then he was gone .
And he refused to meet with us ; he actually yelled at Congressman LoBiondo , said , "" I 'm not meeting with you people . ""
So he would n't tell us why .
He decided to sneak off in the dark of night .
The morning after the night before , and it 's the Republican party that appears to be cradling a sore head and indulging in self - recrimination over late - night antics and strange bedfellows .
John Boehner , the Speaker of the House , might be the biggest loser from this particular office party , having been found in a compromising position with too many Democrats for his party faithful 's liking .
The heartache comes after the House of Representatives finally approved a deal to ward off the most pressing aspects of the fiscal cliff .
Boehner himself voted for the bill â€ “ but almost two - thirds of the House Republicans failed to follow their leader , including key members of Boehner 's own leadership team , such as majority leader Eric Cantor .
There was also fury at Boehner 's decision not to follow the fiscal cliff vote with legislation offering disaster relief for the areas devastated by Sandy â€ “ with the Speaker refusing to allow a vote on the bill offering $ 60bn in aid .
Politicians from both sides of the aisle attacked Boehner 's decision on Sandy relief â€ “ which may prove to be the catalyst for a challenge to Boehner 's tenure as Speaker in the coming days , assuming the malcontents can find a credible alternative within the GOP caucus .
President Obama , meanwhile , jetted off on Air Force One late last night to continue his interrupted Christmas break in Hawaii , where he is expected to sign the fiscal cliff deal into law .
The best inside account of the tense negotiations in Congress comes from Politico , thanks to eye - catching details of an encounter between Boehner and the Senate majority leader Harry Reid : It was only a few days before the nation would go over the fiscal cliff , no bipartisan agreement was in sight , and Reid had just publicly accused Boehner of running a â€œdictatorshipâ€ � in the House and caring more about holding onto his gavel than striking a deal .
â€œGo fâ€ ” yourself , â€ �
Boehner sniped as he pointed his finger at Reid , according to multiple sources present .
Reid , a bit startled , replied : â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ �
Boehner repeated :
â€œGo fâ€
”
yourself.â€
�
The harsh exchange just a few steps from the Oval Office â€ ” which Boehner later bragged about to fellow Republicans â€ ” was only one episode in nearly two months of high - stakes negotiations laced with distrust , miscommunication , false starts and yelling matches as Washington struggled to ward off $ 500 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts .
The most telling thing here is n't the profanity â€ “ members of Congress are like anyone else .
It 's that "" Boehner later bragged about [ it ] to fellow Republicans "" ."
2013-01-02,"A Republican civil war , which has simmered under the surface since the party 's defeat in last November 's presidential election , has now burst firmly into the open and pitted party leaders against each other .
Majority leader Eric Cantor 's extraordinary vote against House speaker John Boehner in Tuesday 's late - night vote in the House of Representatives may have prevented America from toppling over the so - called fiscal cliff , but it exposed the deep rifts that are destabilising a party once famed for its unity and discipline .
Cantor , 49 , a self - styled "" young gun "" who hews relentlessly to rightwing conservative orthodoxy , is now pitted against Boehner , 63 , a "" country club "" Republican whose pragmatic streak drives him to move the party to the centre in a bid to learn a lesson from President Barack Obama 's second - term victory . ""
Clearly , Boehner and Cantor are not bosom buddies .
They never have been , "" said Professor David Cohen , a political scientist at the University of Akron .
That might be an understatement now .
Just six hours before the crucial vote Cantor 's spokesman , Doug Heye , sent a message on his Twitter account playing down rumours of a split . ""
Majority Leader Cantor stands with @speakerBoehner .
Speculation otherwise is silly , non - productive and untrue . ""
However , Cantor then came out publicly against the bill , voting no , while Boehner himself â€ “ when tradition usually demands that a Speaker not vote â€ “ made a point of personally voting yes .
"" It is extraordinary for a speaker to vote , "" said Republican pollster Steve Mitchell , head of Mitchell Research and Communications .
The two men could come to personify a growing ideological split in the party .
Boehner , with his fondness for golf and his year - round tan , has a reputation for old - school deal - making .
He is seen as a master of backroom politics who is willing to sacrifice policy principle in favour of pragmatic politicking that improves the position of the party as a whole .
As the Republican party seeks to come to terms with a demographic future that is seen as more friendly to Democrats , Boehner is viewed as someone who might steer the party away from the rightwing extremes that deter emerging voting blocs such as Hispanics and women .
Cantor , however , is a darling of that rightwing ; popular with the Tea Party - backed politicians who swept into the House in the 2010 mid - terms and who still wield enormous power .
Together with Mitt Romney 's former running mate , Paul Ryan , and majority whip , Kevin McCarthy ( who also voted no ) , Cantor co - wrote a 2010 book called Young Guns that sought to be a manifesto for an emerging generation of rightwing ideologues .
Cantor 's high - profile "" no "" vote in the fiscal cliff debate now propels him to the front of the conservative movement .
It is a bloc that sees Mitt Romney 's failure to defeat Obama as an example of what happens when you run a moderate who has to espouse rightwing views he does not genuinely hold instead of a true conservative candidate .
It is a profound split in the party .
While Boehner does not look immediately under threat when it comes to a fresh vote this week on his speakership , he does appear to now be in the minority in the House .
Just 84 other Republicans joined Boehner in voting for the compromise bill to avoid the fiscal cliff , while 150 Republicans lined up behind Cantor in the no camp .
"" You have the whole notion of people who want to stand on principle and those who want to be more pragmatic , "" said Professor Tim Hagle , an expert in Republican politics at the University of Iowa .
The fight is also causing problems among other major Republican figures .
New Jersey governor Chris Christie , seen as a leading contender to run for president in 2016 , fumed that the "" toxic internal politics "" of the Republicans in the House had been partly responsible for failing to pass a bill that would deliver billions of dollars of vital aid to areas in the north - east hit last year by Hurricane Sandy .
The split also represents different ways of looking at where the party 's focus should be .
Boehner and the more pragmatic wing of the party see the Republicans ' 2012 defeat as a sign that the party is losing touch with a younger and more ethnically diverse national electorate that can deliver a candidate to the White House .
The party 's conservatives , however , look to their own party 's still Tea Party - infused base and gerrymandered congressional districts that too often provide safe seats to extremists .
As the 2014 mid - term elections hove into view , some observers believe that those backing Boehner could be punished for their ' yes ' vote and further undermine Boehner 's position .
"" Some of those Republicans who voted for this are going to lose their seats because of this one vote , "" said Mitchell .
That means Cantor 's dissent could tie in with eventual ambitions to take Boehner 's job .
If Republicans in the House emerge from 2014 even more in the grip of conservative ideologues , he will be well - placed to launch a bid for the speakership himself . ""
Cantor is a shrewd political animal .
He is incredibly ambitious .
He will do whatever he needs to do to take control of that speaker 's gavel , "" said Professor Cohen .
That would defy a general consensus view that says Republicans should not repeat the sort of presidential primary that marred the 2012 race , when the Republican field was dominated by misfit candidates who courted the rightwing base at the expense of wooing centrist Americans .
Cantor 's rise would see the party go even further right .
It is a problem that Boehner is no doubt aware of . ""
Boehner has a problem on his hands .
He could only get a third of his party to vote for the fiscal cliff legislation .
That is a sign of weakness , "" Cohen said ."
2013-01-04,"John Boehner , the speaker of the House of Representatives , survived a re - election vote when the new Congress met for the first time Thursday , in spite of deep ideological divisions within his own Republican party that have left him badly wounded .
In contrast with 2010 when he won the unanimous support of his own party , a small group in the GOP registered their unhappiness with him .
He has lost a lot of support over his handling of the fiscal cliff negotiations , and other issues .
Although on the surface his majority looks comfortable , Boehner won mainly because warring Republicans could not come up with alternative candidates to unite behind .
Only Boehner and the Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi were on the ballot .
He won 220 votes , just three more than needed to prevent an embarrassing second ballot , to Pelosi 's 192 .
Nine Republicans voted against Boehner .
Ironically , he was saved by some of the members of Congress that have made life awkward for him over the past few years , in particular Tea Party favourite Michele Bachmann .
Boehner , before being sworn in , signalled renewed battles with the White House over spending .
"" Our government has built up too much debt .
Our economy is not producing enough jobs .
And these are not separate problems .
At $ 16tn , our national debt is draining free enterprise and weakening the ship of state .
The American dream is in peril , "" he said .
Boehner , an emotional man who has cried several times in public , almost broke down again during his short speech .
His only reference to the bruising battles he has had with the White House and his own party came when he said the voters had not sent members to Congress to make a name for themselves but to act .
"" We are standing here not to be something but to do something or , as I like to call it , doing the right thing . ""
The new Congress sworn in at noon on Thursday is more diverse by race , gender and sexual preference , and includes a Hindu , a Buddhist , and two female combat veterans .
For the first time , white men are in a minority , at least among House Democrats .
But , crucially , the political make - up is largely unchanged .
There are a few more Democrats and fewer Tea Party - backed Republicans , but essentially the balance remains the same , with the Democrats in control of the Senate and warring Republicans with a majority in the House .
The Congress looks on course to be as unproductive as the last one , paralysed by civil war being fought inside the Republican caucus in the House , between the Tea Party - backed members and more moderate and pragmatic ones .
Barack Obama has a set out an ambitious second - term programme that includes immigration reform and gun control , but that could be jeopardised by looming battles over spending cuts and the debt ceiling , and the unwillingness of Republicans to work with the president .
The Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell , put Obama on notice in speech from the floor of the Senate Thursday .
"" In a couple of months , the president will ask us to raise the nation 's debt limit .
We can not agree to increase that borrowing limit without agreeing to reforms that lower the avalanche of spending that 's created this debt in the first place , "" McConnell said .
The standoff between Congress and the White House , and the feuding between Republican members of Congress , mirrors the wider conflict that the November election defeat failed to resolve : whether the Republicans shift even more to the right or pivot towards the centre .
Boehner , an old - fashioned , country - club Republican who looks to work out deals with his Democratic counterparts , has struggled over the last two years to keep the two factions together .
He was humiliated by his own members before Christmas when he could not persuade them to back his own fiscal cliff plan .
He was exposed again this week when a fiscal cliff deal was finally voted on , with only 85 Republicans voting for , including Boehner himself , and 152 against .
As well as alienating Tea Party - backed Republicans opposed to the deal , Boehner managed in the same week to alienate more moderate and pragmatic Republicans from the north - east by failing to schedule a vote on aid for towns damaged by Hurricane Sandy , opposed by some Republicans for containing unnecessary spending projects .
In the ensuing outcry , Boehner hastily backed down and has scheduled a vote for Friday .
One of the moderate Republicans , Steve LaTourette , interviewed by CNN , blamed the pattern of crisis after crisis in Congress â€ “ which made it one of the most unproductive sessions in recent US history â€ “ on the Tea Party conservatives unhappy with the failure to rein in spending and cut the federal debt . ""
So as a result , they have laid obstacles in front of the speaker for the last two years , "" LaTourette said .
The divisions in the Republican party are unlikely to be resolved until at least the next congressional elections , the mid - terms in 2014 .
Democrats will urge voters to end the Washington deadlock to give them a majority in both the Senate and House .
Voters could resolve it , too , by turfing out the Tea Party - backed members , as they did in November when they opted not to re - elect congressman Allen West , a Tea Party favourite who denounced Obama as a Marxist ideologue .
Or they might opt to punish moderate Republicans , as representatives of the Tea Party movement threatened to on Thursday .
Amy Kremer , the leader of Tea Party Express , expressed outrage over the fiscal cliff deal , said on Twitter : "" There will be consequences .
"" One of the biggest fears of moderate Republicans is finding themselves facing primary battles in their districts or states , up against Tea Party - backed candidates .
If the civil war is not resolved in 2014 , the battle then moves onto the 2016 presidential nomination , beginning with the Iowa caucus .
That fight is already under way .
The present favourite is Marco Rubio , the senator from Florida with the Cuban background , who might help the party win back some of the Latino vote from the Democrats .
He is also a Tea Party favourite , and could be the figure that brings the warring factions together .
Rubio was one of the few Republican senators to vote against the fiscal cliff deal , leaving him able to claim ideological purity and retain Tea Party support .
On the other side of the spectrum is New Jersey governor Chris Christie , who spent most of a 40-minute press conference on Wednesday denouncing Boehner and Republicans in the House for failing to support aid for his state 's devastated communities .
He criticised the intrigue that has engulfed the House Republicans as one of the reasons why the public have come to hate Congress .
Christie is often mentioned as a potential runner for 2016 .
Conservatives then face a dilemma , balancing Christie 's popularity against his liberal views , including ambiguous positions on issues such as gun control .
Boehner can not even rely on his own lieutenants , the House majority leader Eric Cantor and the House whip Kevin McCarthy , both of whom voted against the fiscal cliff deal .
Cantor is a another potential runner in 2016 , but he will have lost the support of some of his colleagues , having encouraged them to vote for the deal and then voted against himself .
Romney 's vice - presidential running - mate Paul Ryan could also be among the runners in 2016 .
Generally regarded as a fiscal conservative , he surprised his colleagues by voting for the deal ."
2013-01-04,"Is Chris Christie the future of the Republican party or its past ?
With sky - high approval ratings and a campaign war chest that ballooned to over $ 2 m in just the 36 days since he announced he was running for re - election , Christie seems poised to lift the Republican brand with as much panache and soulful lip - quivering as he lifted the spirits of his constituents in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy .
Christie 's recent apostasies â€ “ bashing GOP House speaker John Boehner , his fulsome election - eve embrace of Obama â€ “ as well as his bluff , jocular mien have the pundit class ( self included ) singing his praises , even as conservative stalwarts such as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck attempt to excommunicate him from the party .
So , is the rotund Garden Stater a regional anomaly or the next Republican presidential nominee ?
And does his fundraising prowess give him the power to shape the GOP 's national agenda or is he simply the most recent winner of the "" Morning Joe "" primary ?
( Past recipients of its zero delegates include Jon Huntsman and Michael Bloomberg . )
As a snarky sort with a progressive bent , I get Christie 's appeal .
In the aftermath of Sandy , his brazen sentimentality and brusque rejection of Republican talking points resonated with anyone who was sick of campaign rhetoric and simply heartbroken by the reality of the storm 's destruction .
More generally , Christie is winningly self - deprecating about his weight ; he has cast sensible doubt on the wisdom of putting armed guards in our nation 's schools
( he has been dubious about gun "" rights "" historically as well ) ; and he had the good sense to embrace early and often the nation 's second most popular black Democrat , Newark Mayor Cory Booker .
And I think I 've heard he 's a Springsteen fan
â€ “ a designation which puts him in the front row alongside the rest of the Washington media elite .
Hard - right Republicans ' displeasure with Christie only pushes people like myself further into the throes of infatuation .
New Jersey resident , torture enthusiast and sharia doomsayer
Andrew McCarthy 's one - man jihad ( ahem ) against Christie alone is enough to prompt a potential write - in campaign among the New York Times ' editorial board .
Conservative wrath against Christie , however , raises two obvious questions about the New Jersey governor 's future , and one not - so - obvious one .
First , is it possible for the party to cast out a former convention keynoter and much - beseeched 2008 would - be candidate ?
Second , is it a good idea to even try ?
Off the top of my head , I 'd say it 's probably not possible to forcibly remove the "" R "" from Christie 's identity , no matter
how many working - class anthems
he knows the words to .
As for the usefulness of the exercise , see above .
The more that deep - red ideologues try to paint Christie blue , the more purple hearts will melt .
Which brings us to the less discussed and a more subtle inquiry is this : what is everyone so upset and/or excited about ?
Conservative upset has a way of occluding Christie 's most obvious immoderate views .
He has an abysmal record on unions and worker protections .
In itself , this is not a politically deadly stance , but the legislation his office has put forward along those lines came directly from the Koch brothers - backed American Legislative Exchange Council ( Alec ) , an alliance that puts him in the same league as Tea Party favorite Scott Walker .
He 's taken an at - best ambivalent approach to gay rights : he vetoed marriage equality legislation in favor of demanding a voter referendum .
This seems all the more backward given that marriage equality already enjoys high approval in his state .
Christi is also anti - choice to the point of vetoing $ 7.4 m in women 's health funding because it would have benefited New Jersey Planned Parenthood clinics .
When it comes to economic policy , he favors low taxes for the wealthy and has joined other Republican governors in the largely symbolic refusal to participate directly in the insurance exchanges mandated by the Affordable Care Act .
Most damningly of all , but hardly to be found in the reams of Christie coverage recently published , is Christie 's faithfulness to the New Jersey tradition of patronage and lawmaker - lobbyist revolving doors : he 's a former registered lobbyist himself .
One of the consequences of his adherence to the state 's relationship with private prison operator Community Education Centers is another sort of revolving door : this one for the hundreds of prisoners who regularly depart the company 's cheap - but - poorly - supervised halfway houses where about 40 % of New Jersey 's prison population resides at one time or another .
None of this makes Christie a bad guy or even a bad politician ; it just makes him a not - terribly - exceptional one .
Even his anti - Boehner harangue is less a blow for independence than simply a well - timed channeling of the national mood
â€ ¦ Christie is not a student of The Boss for nothing , it seems ."
2013-01-05,"Who has n't got got a little teary after a bad spell at the office ?
John Boehner , having survived a brief but painful challenge to his position as the most powerful Republican in Congress , was entitled to sniffle , even if â€ “ unlike most of us
â€ “ he had to do it live on television . ""
So help us God , "" Boehner said with evident relief , ending his brief remarks after being elected Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 113th Congress , and enduring a bout of uncertainty whether he would get enough support from his GOP colleagues to win on the first ballot .
He did â€ “ just .
An awkward squad of hard - liners , refuseniks and enemies within the Republican caucus mustered just nine votes against Boehner 's re - election , failing by eight to deny Boehner re - election and force a second ballot that would have triggered chaos within party ranks .
The vote 's damp squib was an echo of the friendly fire that Boehner has already faced , as well as a symptom of the circular firing squad within the unruly GOP caucus with which Boehner has struggled since he was first elected speaker in 2010 .
One of Boehner 's colleagues in the House , Hal Rogers of Kentucky , summed up the speaker 's plight to the New York Times : "" It 's a little bit like being the head caretaker of the cemetery .
There are a lot of people under you but nobody listens . ""
Last week 's events , straddling the 112th and 113th congresses and the fiscal cliff denouement over the new year , have their seeds in the debt ceiling and budget fight of 2011 , when Boehner saw his attempt at a "" grand bargain "" with the White House dissolve in the face of opposition from his own side .
Fast forward to the end of December 2012 , and Boehner had once again negotiated and then collapsed a deal with the White House .
This time , however , he could n't even rally his own side to back a bill of his own devising .
As the clock ran out on a solution to the fiscal cliff combination of tax increases and budget cuts , Boehner announced that he would go ahead with a "" plan B "" : legislation that allowed for income tax rates to rise on incomes over $ 1 m .
It was designed to be political theatre , to offer a Republican alternative and put pressure on the White House .
But even though "" plan B "" was far above President Obama 's avowed tax - rise level of $ 250,000 , or even the $ 400,000 that Boehner had negotiated with Obama , along with a number of other concessions , Republicans in the House refused to support it
â€ “ forcing Boehner into the humiliating position of ditching a vote on his own plan .
Unable to even pass his most basic set of demands , Boehner had to admit that he could n't offer an alternative . ""
The House did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass , "" he dolefully conceded in a statement , saying it was now up to the White House and the Senate to proceed .
As time ticked away , Boehner was forced to watch from the sidelines , after expecting to be at the centre of the action .
On the final weekend , he could only drop by Capitol Hill wearing a woollen pullover , signifying that he was off - duty .
When Boehner finally called the House back into session , the deal had been done without him .
And having pledged that he would only go ahead with legislation backed by a majority of the GOP caucus , he was trapped .
The Republican leadership 's whipping operation was woeful : the bill received only 85 GOP votes , passing through the House on Democratic support .
Nearly two - thirds of Republicans in the House voted against it , including Boehner 's ally , the majority leader Eric Cantor .
Angry recriminations followed , as various Tea Party factions vowed revenge .
And â€ “ as revealed by Politico â€ “ Boehner 's own anger surfaced in public , with the news that he had reportedly told Reid to "" go fuck yourself "" during talks on the fiscal cliff the previous week .
Worse was to come : once the fiscal cliff deal was passed , Boehner had sent his troops home for the night , squashing a vote planned to give more than $ 60bn in disaster relief to the areas that were hit by Hurricane Sandy .
That decision sent Republicans from the storm - hit region into apoplexy .
A string of New York congressman denounced Boehner on cable news .
Then Chris Christie , the formidable governor of New Jersey , held a brutal press conference in which he pointedly shamed Boehner for having dropped the Sandy relief bill .
"" There is only one group to blame , "" Christie said , "" The House Majority and John Boehner ... It was the Speaker 's decision â€ “ his alone . ""
Hurried negotiations with the unhappy Republicans followed , and a promise of two votes on relief funds for Sandy 's victims stopped the cable news bloodletting .
Yet as the clips of Christie 's rebuke were still being replayed , the following day saw another dose of humiliation as Boehner ran for re - election as speaker .
Luckily for him , a rebellion by a few Republicans was poorly planned and lacked an credible alternative candidate â€ “ but even then the attempt came within a handful of votes of upsetting Boehner 's re - election .
Live on television , the roll call of House members showed the tally of those voting against Boehner inching up .
There was a brief frenzy as the combined anti - Boehner votes and absent members rose to 17 , the figure that would potentially trigger a second ballot .
But it collapsed again when a few of the absentee members emerged to vote for Boehner , giving him the majority he needed .
If Boehner thought the Republicans of the 113th Congress were going to be any happier than those of the 112th , then he had better order another truck - load of tissues .
The day after his re - election , Boehner saw 67 Republicans in the House vote against an otherwise unexceptional bill extending flood insurance relief for Sandy victims by $ 9bn â€ “ including a clump of new members who had been sworn in on Thursday .
In an ominous sign , the nays included the former vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan .
With another vote on $ 50bn of Sandy relief coming up , not to mention the debt ceiling and budget negotiations in coming months , Boehner may need more than a shoulder to cry on ."
2013-02-14,"The president ignited a controversy in his state of the union speech by saying he wants to raise the minimum wage by $ 1.75 , to $ 9 an hour .
He argued that it is shameful that someone working full - time for the current minimum wage of $ 7.25 would still be below the poverty line .
Opponents â€ “ led by Speaker of the House John Boehner and an endless cadre of mustache - twirling corporate leaders and overpaid Washington think - tankers â€ “ have said they oppose the president 's plans .
They argue that employers forced to pay a higher minimum wage will just hire fewer people to work full - time , that the promise of economic progress from higher pay is illusory , and that a boost in the minimum wage rarely translates to an uptick in economic activity .
These are empty threats , and spurious ones .
The issue about minimum wage , for instance , has almost nothing to do with full - time workers and whether they get hired or not .
Only 5.2 % of hourly workers are paid minimum wage or below .
That 's 3.8 million people .
It is true that affecting the pay of such a small number of people wo n't solve America 's increasing problems of poverty or income inequality by itself .
But what happens when you look at part - time workers ?
Then you understand how craven it is to deny workers minimum wage .
There are 8 million workers who are working part - time due to economic reasons , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
That means that they want to work full - time , but ca n't .
There are also 18.7 million workers who are part - time out of choice , or for "" non - economic reasons "" .
Those part - time workers are where poverty ends up concentrated , and where the minimum wage will make the most impact .
Part - time workers are much more likely to end up working for minimum wage , according to the BLS 's analysis .
Fast - food makes up a decent portion of minimum - wage jobs
â€ “
that 's why McDonald 's stock fell the most after the president announced his plan â€ “ and those workers tend to be older and less likely to be able to find jobs elsewhere .
They have no economic leverage .
These part - time , minimum - wage workers also tend to include people who may be working multiple jobs to make ends meet .
No matter what they do , they will end up below the poverty line .
In December , Bloomberg reported the story of Tyree Johnson , a homeless man who used his two part - time , minimum - wage jobs at McDonalds to pay for a nightly room at a single - occupancy hotel .
He 's been working for two decades and still ca n't get the hours necessary to make his work full - time .
He scrubs with soap in the sink each day because , he told Bloomberg , "" I hate when my boss tells me she wo n't give me a raise because she can smell me . ""
Johnson is just one story of many , obviously .
So when corporate leaders talk about how the minimum wage wo n't pull people up from the poverty line , they 're right : many companies that rely on minimum - wage workers , from McDonald 's to Walmart , have already figured out how to treat their workers as commodities , and poverty is now built into the system because of that .
In a longtime period of joblessness like the one we 're living through , people will take whatever job they can get .
But there is an intellectual dishonesty here too , as well as a craven contribution to the country 's economic woes .
Corporate leaders should n't have to be told by the government to pay their workers a living wage .
They know that consumers will drive the recovery , but consumption by the rich does n't do it .
You need the middle and lower classes .
So when those corporate leaders resort to threats to hold workers hostage â€ “ citing numbers about how raising the minimum wage by $ 1.50 will cause them to fire people â€
“
they should take a step back and look at some other numbers .
Try this number , for instance : Over one in five American children is living in poverty .
There are others , but are they really necessary ?
This is the world 's leading country and 20 % of children are part of families that can barely find money to eat .
Aside from the numbers , there is the issue of image .
There is something truly grotesque about corporate leaders who earn millions of dollars â€ “ or even hundreds of thousands of dollars â€ “ arguing over paying their workers literally pennies more .
Those workers often have to rely on food stamps or government welfare programs to make up the difference .
Meanwhile , company CEOs have barely received a cut in pay for years , and on average they make 231 times as much as the average worker .
That 's a lot of money , obviously .
So the idea that paying $ 1.50 an hour more in minimum wage would break their companies and force them to save on costs is patently ridiculous .
The first and most obvious cost they would have to think about cutting would be their own pay packages .
What if those CEOs made , say , only 200 times the average worker ?
Or 100 times ?
One suspects their companies could afford that uptick for poorer workers then .
Most of all , the insistence of business leaders on a lower minimum wage looks , to any other country , completely revolting .
It is a Dickensian image of corporate callousness , and it comes just when Corporate America is trying to dig out from its image hole of appearing unconscionable and dastardly .
Business leaders and plump Washington lawmakers would do well to try to step back from their fat bank accounts and their sense of entitlement and put themselves in the shoes of someone who works part - time just to be able to afford food to eat and a bed for the night .
Is that the America they want to create ?
Because keeping poor people down so that they ca n't even dream of being middle - class seem like a full - time task â€ “ although it seems to pay those corporate leaders a lot more than minimum wage ."

2013-02-27,"Almost 58 years after her famous protest on an Alabama bus , the "" first lady of civil rights "" has been given a permanent place in Congress .
Though mired in tension over the looming budget sequester , president Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner put politics aside on Wednesday to unveil a 9 ft bronze statue of Rosa Parks in the Capitol 's Statuary Hall .
Boehner , who gave a welcome address at the unveiling ceremony said : "" Every now and then , we 've got to step back and say to ourselves : ' What a country . '
This is one of those moments . ""
In 1955 Parks , who is often called the "" mother of the civil rights movement "" , refused to obey a bus driver in Montgomery , Alabama when he asked her to give up her seat for a white passenger .
Her subsequent arrest for disobeying state law ignited a 381-day boycott of the bus system . ""
This morning we celebrate a seamstress slight in stature but mighty in courage "" , said Obama , to an audience including more than 50 of Parks ' relatives and members of Congress .
"" In a single moment , with the simplest of gestures , she helped change America and the world . ""
Though a bust of another African - American woman , the 19th - century abolitionist Sojourner Truth , sits in the Capitol Visitor Center , Parks is the first African - American woman to have a place in Statuary Hall itself .
The highest - ranking African - American member of Congress , James Clyburn , called Parks "" the first lady of civil rights , the mother of the movement , the saint of an endless struggle "" .
The new statue depicts a dignified - looking Parks , sitting down with her arms folded across her lap .
Parks , who died in 2005 , became the first woman and the third non - US government official to lie in honor at the Capitol Rotunda ( Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson , police officers killed at the Capitol in 1998 , were the first ) .
She was given the presidential medal of freedom in 1996 and the congressional medal in 1999 ."
2013-03-03,"Billions of dollars in sequester - induced budget cuts appear set to stay for the time being , with leading political figures in Washington indicating no early resolution to the impasse , as they eye next year 's congressional elections .
John Boehner , the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , said on Sunday he saw no path to agreement with the president over the $ 85bn in automatic cuts , about half to military spending , that kicked in on Friday after the two sides failed to agree a package of budget reductions and tax rises to tackle the deficit .
"" I do n't think anyone quite understands how it gets resolved , "" he said on NBC 's Meet the Press .
Pressed on why he does not agree to the president 's demand to increase revenues by closing tax loopholes , Boehner turned the question around and accused Barack Obama of failing to keep his side of the implicit bargain that higher taxes already agreed should be matched with spending cuts . ""
The president got $ 650bn of higher taxes on the American people on January the first .
How much more does he want ?
When is the president going to address the spending side of this ? "" said Boehner .
"" You ca n't tax our way out of this problem .
We 've got to deal with the spending side , just like every American family has to . ""
Boehner said he made the same point at a "" very frank "" but polite meeting with the president on Friday .
Obama emerged from the encounter saying he saw little prospect of an agreement with Republicans in Congress in the near future .
The president , apparently with one eye on the 2014 mid - term elections , predicted that it will take public opinion to shift the GOP . ""
What I ca n't do is force Congress to do the right thing , "" he said after the meeting .
"" The American people may have the capacity to do that . ""
Obama suggested that voters , sick of lurching from one financial crisis to another , will pressure their representatives . ""
After some reflection , as members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are being negatively impacted â€ ¦ that they step back and say , all right , is there a way for us to move forward on a package of entitlement reforms , tax reform , not raising tax rates , identifying programmes that do n't work , coming up with a plan that 's comprehensive , and that makes sense , "" he said .
"" It 's going to mean hundreds of thousands of jobs lost .
That is real .
We 're not making that up .
That 's not a scare tactic , that 's a fact .
"" The president has said he did not know how long it will take for the cuts to shift the Republican position . ""
It may take a couple of weeks .
It may take a couple of months , "" he said .
Gene Sperling , director of the White House National Economic Council , said Obama called a select group of Republican members of Congress on Saturday who may be more likely to consider "" tax reform that raises revenues to lower the deficit "" .
The president also spoke to Democrats open to tackling entitlement spending long - term .
But the Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell , said his party will not be backing down and remains committed to $ 1.2tn in spending cuts over the next decade without increasing taxes .
"" I 'm absolutely confident we 're going to reduce spending the amount of money we promised the American people we would in a law the president signed a year and a half ago , "" he told CNN .
"" We said we 're open to discussing how to reconfigure those spending reductions without raising taxes â€
¦
So far I have n't heard a single Senate Republican say they would be willing to raise a dime in taxes to turn off the sequester . ""
A report in the Washington Post on Sunday suggested that Obama had all but given up on attempts to push for bipartisan solutions to problems in Washington .
Instead he was focusing on winning back the House in next year 's mid - term elections to force through his remaining agenda .
But McConnell said he does not think voters will be swayed against Republicans . ""
The American people look at this and say : gee , I 've had to cut my budget more than this â€ “ probably on numerous occasions over the last four years because we 've had such a tepid economy now for four long years , "" he said .
Boehner said he did not know what the long term effect of the sequester will be .
"" I do n't know whether it 's going to hurt the economy or not .
I do n't think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going to work , "" he said .
Still , the Republican leaders kept the door open to further negotiation at least on how the sequester cuts are distributed .
They are keen to reduce the impact on the military and shift more of the burden to welfare spending which is already severely hit .
"" We 're willing to talk to him ( Obama ) about reconfiguring the same amount of spending reduction over the next six months , "" said McConnell .
Boehner said he did not think the spending crisis would reach the point of a government shutdown later this month , and that Congress will approve the funding to keep federal agencies open after March 27 .
"" We should not have any talk of a government shutdown
so I 'm hopeful that the House and Senate will be able to work through this , "" he said ."
2013-03-29,"House speaker John Boehner has admonished a senior Republican colleague over the use of a racial slur to describe Hispanic immigrants .
Boehner joined other Republicans in demanding a full apology of Alaska representative Don Young , who drew widespread condemnation for calling Hispanics "" wetbacks "" in a radio interview .
Young , who has represented Alaska 's at - large district in the House since 1973 , said he meant "" no disrespect "" by the comment .
Boehner described Young 's remarks as "" offensive and beneath the dignity of the office he holds "" .
He added : "" I do n't care why he said it ; there 's no excuse and it warrants an immediate apology . ""
The Democrat minority leader of the House , Nancy Pelosi , also called for a full apology over the "" deeply offensive "" remarks .
The phrase "" wetback "" is regarded as an offensive slur .
It was originally used to describe Mexican immigrants who entered the US by crossing the Rio Grande .
Young , speaking on KRBD radio , was discussing how the mechanisation of farming practices had led to fewer jobs .
He said : "" My father had a ranch â€ “ we used to have 50 to 60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes .
It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now .
It 's all done by machine . ""
In a statement released on Thursday , Young said he had used the term innocently , and meant no harm by it .
Young , 79 , said the phrase was one he "" commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in central California "" .
But he accepted that the term was "" not used in the same way nowadays
and I meant no disrespect "" .
But in a tweet , Pelosi dismissed Young 's apparent defence that the term has become more offensive with time . ""
Congressman Young should fully apologise for deeply offensive comments that were not appropriate in his youth or now , "" she said .
Young 's comments come at a sensitive time for the Republicans , with many in the party looking to soften its line on immigration following November 's election loss .
A record number of Hispanics voted , making up 10 % of the overall electorate , according to the Pew Research Center .
Of those , 71 % favoured Barack Obama over Republican rival Mitt Romney .
American Crossroads â€ “ the conservative Super Pac backed by former George W Bush adviser Karl Rove â€
“ recently launched a fighting fund to counter "" undisciplined "" primary candidates from the fringe of the party .
It comes after a brace of high - profile Senate seat defeats in November where Republican faced a backlash over comments on rape and abortion .
Meanwhile , a Michigan member of the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) was under increasing pressure on Friday to resign over an anti - gay diatribe posted on Facebook .
Dave Agema , who served as a state congressman from 2007 until late last year , put up an excerpt of an article titled Everyone
Should Know These Statistics On Homosexuals .
Among other homophobic slurs , the article describes homosexuality as a "" filthy lifestyle "" , adding that gay and lesbian people have an agenda of turning people against Christianity .
It also claims that many gay people admit to being paedophiles .
A group of 21 Michigan Republicans have since called the paper "" deplorable "" .
Agema also appeared to receive a rebuke from RNC chairman Reince Priebus .
Priebus said that although the party 's position on gay marriage â€ “ an issue that this week went before the supreme court â€ “ is clear , "" all human beings deserve to be treated with dignity and respect . ""
Despite increasing pressure over the article posted on his Facebook page , Agema told the Associated Press that he will "" absolutely not "" resign from the RNC ."
2013-03-30,"A senior Republican congressman has bowed to intense political pressure and apologised for comments in which he referred to Hispanic immigrants as "" wetbacks "" Don Young , who has represented the entire state of Alaska in the House of Representatives since 1973 , said in a statement that there was "" no malice in my heart or intent to offend "" but he was "" sorry "" over a "" poor choice of words "" .
His words came after an initial attempt to limit any backlash over his use of the racial slur without issuing a frank apology was attacked by colleagues in the House , including Republican leader John Boehner .
The House speaker said Friday that the remark â€ “ which was made by Young during a radio interview â€ “ was "" offensive and beneath the dignity of the office holds "" .
"" I do n't care why he said it ; there 's no excuse and it warrants an immediate apology , "" Boehner added , in a strongly worded admonishment .
The Democrat minority leader , Nancy Pelosi , attacked Young over his "" deeply offensive "" remark .
In a statement released on Thursday , Young said he had used the term innocently , and had meant no harm by it .
Young , 79 , said the phrase was one he "" commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in central California "" .
But his words fell short of a full apology .
Later on Friday he issued a broader statement .
"" I apologise for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan , Alaska , "" Young said .
"" There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend ; it was a poor choice of words .
That word , and the negative attitudes that come with it , should be left in the 20th century , and I 'm sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform . ""

2013-04-08,"United States Barack Obama led tributes , describing Margaret Thatcher as "" one of the great champions of freedom and liberty "" and a true friend to the US .
Former president George HW Bush and the Republican House speaker John Boehner also paid generous tributes .
Obama , in a statement from the White House , focused on her success in breaking gender barriers . ""
As a grocer 's daughter who rose to become Britain 's first female prime minister , she stands as an example to our daughters that there is no glass ceiling that ca n't be shattered , "" the president said .
"" As prime minister , she helped restore the confidence and pride that has always been the hallmark of Britain at its best .
And as an unapologetic supporter of our transatlantic alliance , she knew that with strength and resolve we could win the cold war and extend freedom 's promise . ""
Thatcher was an icon for conservative figures in the US , both as partner of Ronald Reagan , the most popular Republican president since 1945 , and as a champion of small government and balanced budgets .
But her popularity extended well beyond the American right .
With Reagan , she was widely viewed as being instrumental in the collapse of the Soviet Union .
There was praise too from Hollywood , with Meryl Streep , who played Thatcher in her declining years in The Iron Lady , expressing her admiration for Thatcher 's pressing ahead with what she believed in , despite arousing a level of hatred normally confined to "" mass murderers "" .
The former president Bill Clinton praised her achievement in becoming the first female British prime minister .
He described her as a fearless leader . ""
Like so many others , I respected the conviction and self - determination she displayed throughout her remarkable life as she broke barriers , defied expectations and led her country , "" Clinton said .
"" Here in America , many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan , reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history â€ “ we can shape them with moral conviction , unyielding courage and iron will . ""
George Bush , who occupied the White House towards the end of Thatcher 's premiership , said in a statement on behalf of himself and his wife Barbara : "" Margaret was , to be sure , one of the 20th century 's fiercest advocates of freedom and free markets â€ “ a leader of rare character who carried high the banner of her convictions , and whose principles in the end helped shape a better , freer world . ""
The personal grief we Bushes feel is compounded by the knowledge that America has lost one of the staunchest allies we have ever known ; and yet we have confidence that her sterling record of accomplishment will inspire future generations .
May God bless the memory of Margaret Thatcher . ""
Henry Kissinger , secretary of state under presidents Nixon and Ford , told CNN : "" She was a woman who [ knew that ] a leader needed to have strong convictions because the public had no way of orienting itself unless its leadership , its leaders , gave it the real push .
She did n't think it was her job to find the middle ground . ""
Thatcher still has a resonance in the US today , being frequently cited in speeches by conservatives .
CNN showed a passage of one of her speeches relevant to the present debate about curbing the debt .
Boehner , who is at the centre of the White House - Congress confrontation over debt and spending , described her as the greatest peacetime prime minister in British history .
He said : "" Margaret Thatcher , a grocer 's daughter , stared down elites , union bosses and communists to win three consecutive elections . ""
Boehner added : "" Americans will always keep Lady Thatcher in our hearts for her loyalty to Ronald Reagan and their friendship that we all admired .
At this difficult hour , I send the condolences of the US House of Representatives to prime minister Cameron and the British people . ""
The Republican senator John McCain , who backed Reagan in his approach to the Soviet Union , described Thatcher as "" one of the great leaders "" of the last century . ""
To have withstood the special hatred and ridicule , unprecedented in my opinion , levelled in our time at a public figure who was not a mass murderer ; and to have managed to keep her convictions attached to fervent ideals and ideas â€ “ wrongheaded or misguided as we might see them now â€ “ without corruption
â€
“
I see that as evidence of some kind of greatness , worthy for the argument of history to settle .
"" To have given women and girls around the world reason to supplant fantasies of being princesses with a different dream â€ “ the real - life option of leading their nation â€ “ this was groundbreaking and admirable .
"" Russia It was Krasnaya Zvezda , the Red Army 's newspaper , that dubbed Thatcher the "" Iron Lady "" in a 1977 article .
The title stuck around , but the Soviet Union did n't and the USSR 's last premier , Mikhail Gorbachev , 82 , said her death was "" a sad thing "" and described her as "" a great politician "" who "" will remain in our memory and in history "" .
He recalled how his relations with Thatcher "" were difficult at times , not always smooth , but , serious and responsible from both sides "" .
"" Personal relations formed gradually and became more and more friendly , "" he said .
"" Eventually , we managed to reach mutual understanding and it was a contribution to changing the atmosphere between our country and the west and to stopping the cold war . ""
The Russian president , Vladimir Putin , said : "" We have lost a strong political figure . ""
He issued his condolences "" in the name of the Russian leadership "" .
He said Thatcher always brought "" very strong impressions "" and that she was "" pragmatic , strict and responsible "" .
Even Russia 's hardliners found something to respect .
"" She is the greatest woman , the greatest politician , "" said Leonid Kalashnikov , a Communist deputy .
""
As an opponent , I always respected her .
And how she , with the Americans , ' strangled ' the Soviet Union is also worth quite a lot
â€ “ because she did it correctly , logically and in their own interests .
"" Former deputy PM Boris Nemtsov recalled her visiting the city of Nizhny in 1994 as Russia opened up to the world . ""
We went into [ a ] shop and Thatcher bought cheese and came out to see hundreds of city residents waiting for her , "" he said .
"" People were so amazed that they started to shout ' Thatcher for president of Russia ! '
The baroness asked me , what are they screaming ?
She laughed and said , when Gorbachev moves to London they yell that it 's time he became PM of the UK .
They were similar .
Neither one nor the other was loved in their motherland , but were respected abroad . ""
The influential political analyst Stanislav Belkovsky reflected on how Thatcher had been unswerving in her criticism of the "" evil empire "" . ""
Until her coming to power , the western establishment thought that the USSR and communism were permanent , so you do n't have to struggle against them , but come to terms with them , "" he told the Izvestiya newspaper .
"" It was Thatcher and then Reagan who brought the totally new idea that communism can be beaten and destroyed .
And they did it . ""
South Africa Reaction to Thatcher 's death was divided around her stance on the ruling African National Congress , which she once described as "" a typical terrorist organisation "" , and her support for the former apartheid government .
"" I do n't think she ever got it that every day she opposed sanctions , more people were dying , and that the best thing for the assets she wanted to protect was democracy , "" said Dali Tambo , son of the former ANC president Oliver Tambo .
"" Many lives were lost .
It 's a shame that we could never call her one of the champions of the liberation struggle .
Normally we say that when one of us goes , the ANC ancestors will meet them at the pearly gates and give them a standing ovation .
I think it 's quite likely that when Margaret Thatcher reaches the pearly gates , the ANC will boycott the occasion . ""
"" I say good riddance , "" said Pallo Jordan , the ANC 's chief propagandist in exile during the apartheid era .
"" She was a staunch supporter of the apartheid regime .
She was part of the rightwing alliance with Ronald Reagan .
In the end I sat with her in her office with Nelson Mandela in 1991 .
We knew she had no choice .
Although she called us a terrorist organisation , she had to shake hands with a terrorist and sit down with a terrorist .
So who won ? ""
But the country 's last apartheid - era president , FW de Klerk , saluted her as "" one of Britain 's greatest prime ministers "" and said she played a positive role in the process of non - racial constitutional transformation . ""
Although she was always a steadfast critic of apartheid , she had a much better grasp of the complexities and geostrategic realities of South Africa than many of her contemporaries , "" he said .
"" She consistently , and correctly , believed that much more could be achieved through constructive engagement with the South African government than through draconian sanctions and isolation .
The ANC government of the current president , Jacob Zuma , said : "" The ANC was on the receiving end of her policy in terms of refusing to recognise the ANC as the representatives of South Africans and her failure to isolate apartheid after it had been described as a crime against humanity , "" a statement from the ruling party said . ""
However , we acknowledge that she was one of the strong leaders in Britain and Europe to an extent that some of her policies dominate discourse in the public service structures of the world .
Long after her passing on , her impact will still be felt and her views a subject of discussion . ""
Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel , who has been dubbed the Iron Lady of Europe for her tough line over the eurozone crisis , called Thatcher a "" formidable leader in world politics in her time "" .
"" The freedom of the individual stood at the core of her beliefs , therefore , Margaret Thatcher recognised the power of the freedom movement in east Europe early on and supported it , "" she said .
"" I will not forget her part in overcoming the European division and in the end of the cold war .
Margaret Thatcher was not a politician for women , but that she led the highest democratic office as a woman , in times where that was not a given , she set an example for many after her . ""
Michael Roth , of the opposition Social Democratic party , said "" her edge and her charisma "" would be missed . ""
Such special politicians , with special stories shaped by the second world war and the subsequent years of rebuilding , have become rarer in the younger generation , "" he said .
But he added : "" Her radical market policies and her Europe - sceptical politics will certainly not be missed .
Her politics seem to not have gone out of fashion , as evidenced by the radical savings and austerity policies in crisis countries , such as Greece , Portugal and Spain .
That Thatcher legacy is obviously very present there .
She had the sort of politics that I , as a social democrat , obviously find to be wrong , but that are still in effect today .
"" The German foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle , said she "" leaves behind a big legacy for European history .
We look upon her life 's work with wonderment . ""
France Jean - FranÃ§ois CopÃ © , leader of the centre - right French opposition , was among right - leaning European politicians who hinted that Thatcher 's legacy held lessons for the reform of struggling EU economies . ""
She set her goal and stayed the course in the face of all the arguments and succeeding in bringing a spectacular modernisation to the British economy , "" he said .
France 's socialist president , FranÃ§ois Hollande , said she was "" a great personality who profoundly marked the history of her country "" . ""
Throughout her public life , with the conservative beliefs that she fully assumed , she nurtured the influence of the United Kingdom and the defence of its interests , "" he said .
"" The relations she maintained with France were always frank and loyal .
She knew how to build a constructive and fruitful dialogue with FranÃ§ois Mitterrand .
Together , they set about reinforcing the ties between our two countries .
It was in that era that Mme Thatcher gave the decisive push to the construction of the Channel tunnel . ""
Le Monde , which reminded readers of the late President Mitterand 's remark that "" she has the mouth of Marilyn [ Monroe ] and the look of Caligula "" , said : "" She demonstrated the character traits that founded her reputation : an inflexible will , bordering on intransigence ; an almost faultless self control ; above all , the certainty of being right against all winds and tides . ""
Spain Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy hailed Thatcher as "" a true landmark in 20th - century history "" and said it was "" a sad day for Europe as a whole "" . ""
Margaret Thatcher led the UK government at a key moment in history .
Her unerring commitment to freedom , democracy and the rule of law , as well as her firm determination to reform , constitute a most valuable legacy for European leaders who , akin to the 80s when it was her turn to be in power , have to face very complex challenges which require greatly ambitious stances and political courage .
""
Eastern Europe Thatcher was hailed as a champion of freedom and the free market across central and eastern Europe , where she and Ronald Reagan were seen as the west 's pre - eminent cold war warriors .
In Poland , where on a 1988 visit she met Lech Walesa , then leader of the pro - democracy Solidarity union to support the fight against communism , Walesa remembered Thatcher as "" a great person "" .
"" She did a great deal for the world , along with Ronald Reagan , Pope John Paul II and Solidarity , she contributed to the demise of communism in Poland and central Europe , "" he said .
Monuments to Reagan and John Paul II already stand in Poland , and now Thatcher deserved hers , Poland 's foreign minister , Radoslaw Sikorski , said , calling her a "" fearless champion of liberty [ who ] stood up for captive nations . ""
In Prague , Vaclav Klaus , a staunch Eurosceptic who has just left office after a decade as Czech president , called her death "" a huge loss for all supporters of freedom , democracy and market capitalism "" .
"" She was one of the most outstanding political personalities of the last quarter of the 20th century and I believe that with the passing of time , her name will not lose importance , "" he said .
India Manmohan Singh , India 's prime minister , expressed his "" deepest sadness
He said : "" She was a transformative figure under whom the United Kingdom registered important progress on the national and international arena . ""
Narendra Modi , the chief minister of Gujarat state , popular among the country 's businessmen but accused of rightwing Hindu nationalist views by many , saluted an "" inspirational leader of immense stature and fortitude , Baroness Margaret Thatcher was an epoch maker "" .
Reports focused on Thatcher 's friendship with Indira Gandhi , the prime minister of India who was assassinated by her bodyguards in 1984 after ruling for all but three years since 1966 . ""
Very early on , [
Indira Gandhi and I ] struck up a close rapport , for we both felt the loneliness of high office and it was good to be able to talk to someone who understood â€ ¦ Gandhi 's death by terrorism is forever linked in my mind with my own survival of it , ""
Thatcher later said , IANS , an Indian news service , reported .
Thatcher said that she and Gandhi , who launched a massive nationalisation campaign which fundamentally changed India 's economy and suspended democracy to impose a two - year emergency "" had very different ideas about politics . ""
"" But I found in her qualities which seem to me essential in a statesman .
She was passionately proud of her own country , always courageous and very practical . ""
Afghanistan 's president Hamid Karzai , a former mujahadeen who fought the Soviets with Thatcher 's support in the 1980s , offered condolences and said she would be missed as "" a great stateswoman "" .
"" Prime minister Thatcher was one of the greatest leaders the world knew , "" he said .
She would always be remembered in history as "" a well - known and strong leader who had truly served her country , particularly in strengthening UK 's economy "" .
Chile
In Santiago , former supporters of Chilean the dictator , General Augusto Pinochet , talked of Thatcher 's "" bravery "" in supporting his regime at a time when his military government was being accused of killing , interning and tortured his enemies .
Pinochet died in 2006 , but those close to him said Thatcher was a great statesperson . ""
Personally , I see her as a world leader , who was consistent and absolute in her defence of her nation , "" said General Guillermo Garin , retired vice - commander in chief of the Chilean army .
"" Regarding Chile , during the military government , she was very brave .
She recognised the origins of the [ 1973 military coup ] and the benefits of the military government â€
¦
She was a defender of the grand modernisations that Chile put in place and expressed her support versus a very hostile campaign run by the Soviet Union .
President Pinochet always had tremendous admiration for her , they had a very close relationship highlighted by the visit she made to his place of detention in London â€
¦
They shared similar concepts of modernisation of the state . ""
Ghana ""
Thatcher was warlike and uncompromising in her ways , "" said Ghana 's former president John Agyekum Kufuor .
"" I know that in her country some people admired her for that , but to many of us that was n't impressive .
We in Ghana were very critical of the way she led her country into war in South America
â€
“
she seemed too ready to resort to force to settle the Falklands .
And her position on the ANC was n't acceptable .
She proved to be too conservative ; she did n't seem to appreciate the rapidly changing world . ""
But he saluted her economics .
"" She believed that there are only a few creators in this world , entrepreneurs and investors , and that you protect them â€ “
they are the people who will increase the wealth of the nation and create jobs for people .
That is a philosophy I also subscribe to . ""
Nigeria 's former military leader Ibrahim Babangida said he had agreed with Thatcher 's policy on "" constructive engagement "" with South Africa , and that had informed Nigeria 's own stance . ""
[ Thatcher ] told us that its about time that we engaged South Africa in constructive engagement , and that is perhaps the best way to get rid of apartheid .
I took her advice and invited De Klerk to this country .
I think she was a fine example of a very courageous political leader .
She is admired greatly by a majority of countries in Africa , "" he said Israel Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said he was in mourning and sent condolences to the people of Britain , describing Thatcher as "" a truly a great leader , a woman of principle , of determination , of conviction , of strength ; a woman of greatness "" .
"" She was a staunch friend of Israel and the Jewish people .
She inspired a generation of political leaders . ""
Shimon Peres , the current president of Israel who was prime minister and foreign minister during Thatcher 's premiership , said : "" There are people , there are ideas .
Occasionally those two come together to create vision .
Lady Thatcher was an exceptional leader , a colleague in the international arena and a friend for me personally .
She served as an inspiration for other leaders , as the first female prime minister of Great Britain she broke new ground .
She showed how far a person can go with strength of character , determination and a clear vision . ""
Peres praised Thatcher for standing by Israel in times of crisis . ""
During our negotiations with Jordan in the late 1980s , she stood as a mediator and a source of wisdom for me and the king of Jordan , "" he said .
Japan
The prime minister , Shinzo Abe , had recently invoked Thatcher 's resolve during the Falklands war in his country 's ongoing territorial dispute with China .
Abe called her a "" great statesperson "" and Japan 's deputy chief cabinet secretary , Hiroshige Seko , said Abe had "" great respect "" for Thatcher and identified with her conservative agenda for economic reform .
China Hu Xijin , editor in chief of the populist state - run tabloid Global Times , wrote : "" People 's most striking memory is of her ' being tough ' .
As a successful woman in politics , she was revered .
As a politician , her experience and policies stirred feelings . ""
But he added : "" The ' Iron Lady ' era is over .
Today is the era of co - operation . ""
The state broadcaster CCTV talked of the death of the tie niang zi â€ “
Iron Lady â€ “ noting her meetings with the then leader Deng Xiaoping to discuss the handover of Hong Kong , but devoting as much time to her childhood , rise through the ranks and political career .
It noted her free market policies , concerns about the wealth gap and unemployment rate under her governments , and the Falklands war .
Shi Yinhong , an expert on foreign relations at Renmin University , said : "" I think Chinese people respected her and positively assessed her historical role . ""
Although in the process of Hong Kong 's return to China and the negotiations there were some difficulties between Mrs Thatcher and our great leader Deng Xiaoping , Britain and China successfully overcame them and both sides made efforts to smooth the transfer of sovereignty .
"" My guess is that they had something in common in their strategic and political responsibilities .
Both were very determined , responsible people who were not afraid to speak frankly to the other side .
They could respect and understand each other 's national interests . ""

2013-04-15,"The one - time presidential hopeful and darling of the Tea Party Michele Bachmann will be be attending Lady Thatcher 's funeral on Wednesday , as part of a visiting US delegation .
Bachmann , who in 2004 described homosexuality as "" part of Satan "" , will travel to London with two other leading Republicans , John Boehner , the speaker of the House of Representatives , said on Monday .
Boehner described Thatcher as "" one of the greatest champions freedom has ever known "" .
The funeral gave "" Americans and friends around the world an opportunity to pay final respects , "" he said .
The Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn will lead the delegation together with Bachmann and congressman George Holding .
But it is Bachmann 's presence at the funeral which is likely to raise liberal eyebrows .
Elected to Congress in 2006 for Minnesota , Bachmann has been a hardline opponent of gay rights and abortion .
She and her husband Marcus own a Minnesota clinic where counsellors encourage gay people to pray to rid themselves of same - sex desires .
Before joining Congress , she prayed outside abortion clinics .
Her ultra - conservative views made her a favourite on television , especially on Fox News , and rapidly boosted her profile in Washington .
But her attempt to win the 2012 Republican presidential nomination fizzled out early on , and saw her drop out of the race in January last year .
She pulled out after taking just 5 % of the vote in the Iowa caucus .
Most observers believed Bachmann 's campaign to be gaffe - prone , while her extreme social views alienated moderate voters .

2013-04-15,"Gun lobbyists raised record amounts of money for political campaign coffers in the months after the Newtown school shooting , as they attempt to tip the balance on a knife - edge vote on gun control this week .
Federal Election Commission disclosures show the National Rifle Association , which has led efforts to block gun control reform , raised $ 2.7 m for its political action committee in January and February this year â€ “ a 350 % increase on the same period after the last mid - term elections .
It spent some of the money on contributions to a clutch of Republicans in the House of Representatives , including speaker John Boehner , but has also amassed its largest campaign finance warchest for over a decade , according to analysis by the Guardian .
The Senate will begin debating key legislation on Tuesday that would strengthen background checks on gun buyers and close loopholes that currently allow gun fairs and online sellers to avoid laws banning criminals and mentally ill people from purchasing firearms .
But although the Senate last week voted 68 - 31 in favour of allowing this debate to go ahead after a compromise between Republicans and Democrats , voting on the amendment itself is expected to be extremely tight .
Several of the 16 Republicans who rebelled against their party leadership to allow the debate , including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , have since said they will not vote in favour of the legislation .
Other , such as Susan Collins of Maine , have complained of being attacked by TV commercials paid for by the National Association of Gun Rights , a lobby group even more fiercely opposed than the NRA .
Groups favouring gun control have also been spending money , too , with New York mayor Michael Bloomberg financing TV commercials on behalf of a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns .
"" I am being besieged by all sides , "" Collins told NBC .
But proponents of gun legislation are dwarfed by the political muscle of the pro - gun lobby , according to Washington experts .
Kathy Kiely of the Sunlight Foundation said : "" Generally , their power has been in the form of threats : ' You do n't toe the line , [ so ] we come after you . '
They are circling the wagons because they feel like they are under siege . ""
"" Their influence is not just measured in TV ads , "" Keily said .
"" The NRA has tremendous grassroots power because they have this big membership . ""
In January , it was reported that membership of the NRA grew by 250,000 in the month following the Newtown shooting to over 4.25 million members .
The recruitment drive is likely to have played a big part in the surge in contributions to the NRA 's Political Victory Fund , a political action committee that funnels money to politicians .
According to Guardian analysis of the FEC data , it raised $ 2.7 m in January and February , compared with $ 605,000 during the equivalent non - election year period in 2011 .
The figure at this stage in the election cycle in 2009 was $ 1.2 m .
In the latest available filings , the fund also reported a cash pile worth more than $ 4 m
â€ “ the highest figure for this period in a non - election year since at least 1999 .
This time in 2009 it boasted just $ 2.7 m in reserves .
Further NRA finance data for March is due to be released on Saturday , and quarterly filings from politicians were due out later on Monday , which may show which of the swing members of the House and Senate have received fresh money from lobbyists since Newtown .
The biggest fear for politicians is not that the relatively small sums of money given to each of them might dry up â€ “ Speaker Boehner received $ 2,500 from the NRA in January and February â€ “ but that its warchest might be turned against them at the next election .
Figures for the two years leading up to November 's general election show that another NRA - affiliated lobby group , the Institute for Legislative Action , spent $ 8.5 m on television commercials and telephone drives
â€ “
the vast majority attacking opponents rather than promoting its own candidates .
About $ 7.5 m of this spending was also so - called "" dark money "" , which means there is no need to disclose which politicians were targeted by the ads .
Campaign rules mean not - for - profit groups like this can not give money directly to politicians , but only have to detail spending on independent campaigns that explicitly endorse individual candidates .
Analysis of dark money expenditure by the Sunlight Foundation shows the NRA was behind at least five TV ad campaigns against gun control since Newtown , targeting key swing states such as Ohio .
The NRA has also tightened the screws on senators in recent days by taking the unprecedented decision to award negative scores to anyone who voted for last week 's so - called "" cloture motion "" allowing the gun debate to go ahead .
An estimated 21 senators who voted for cloture previously received top marks by the NRA for their stance on gun rights , an endorsement which can be highly influential during elections .
Two Democrats voted against the cloture vote : Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas .
Both are up for re - election next year in predominantly conservative states .
Other red - state Democrats are expected to vote against the amendment on Wednesday , requiring its backers to persuade at least six Republicans to defy the NRA and stick with the compromise agreement for it to pass .
They still face even bigger hurdles in the Republican dominated House of Representatives , where much of the NRA 's lobbying efforts are focused .
The NRA said it opposed the Senate amendment , and any other anti - gun measures , because it would do little to prevent further mass shootings .
"" As we have noted previously , expanding background checks at gun shows or elsewhere will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools , "" it said in a statement . ""
Given the importance of these issues , votes on all anti - gun amendments or proposals will be considered in NRA 's future candidate evaluations . """
2013-07-24,"Republicans seized upon Obama 's speech on the economy as a chance to reiterate their contention that very little about the nation 's situation has changed in the past five years â€ “ and , paradoxically , there 's very little Obama could do about it , even if he wanted to .
"" The president himself said [ the speech ] is n't going to change any minds , "" John Boehner said in a floor speech before Obama even started .
"" All right , well .
So exactly what will change ?
What 's the point ?
What 's it going to accomplish ?
You probably got the answer : nothing .
"" Of course , inertia â€ “ in both the political and economic sense â€ “ was a major theme of the speech itself .
Obama started off with some applause - worthy boosterism : the country leads in technological advances !
We manufacture a lot of stuff !
But the crux of the speech was less optimistic : the existing trends in "" a winner - take - all economy where a few do better and better , while everybody else just treads water â€ “ have been made worse by the recession . ""
Obama 's complaints about the parallel stagnation in Washington were familiar as well .
He called out Republican obstructionism repeatedly , and in at least one unscripted and pointed assertion : Repealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan .
It 's not .
Your opinion as to whether the speech served its purpose depends on your party identification , and your opinion on what its purpose was probably does , too .
For me , it 's a split decision : I am sympathetic to the president 's policies â€ “ using government spending as a lever to enable upward mobility â€ “
but I think he may not have succeeded in what most progressives probably thought was the purpose of the speech : to rally his base and frame a renewed economic policy debate over the coming months .
Maybe , I 'm being too literal , but I keep getting stuck on the very title of the speech , "" A Better Bargain for the Middle Class . ""
Here 's the problem : the "" middle class "" â€ “ a once - reliable rallying point for both parties â€ “
is shrinking ( not really news ) ; and so are the numbers of Americans who think they are members of it .
What used to be the case â€ “ Americans defined themselves as "" middle class "" even if they were n't â€ “ is starting to adjust to sad reality : Americans do n't think of themselves as "" middle class "" , because they 're not .
A Pew study this spring found the number of Americans defining themselves as "" middle class "" has slipped from 53 % to 49 % since 2008 , while those identifying themselves as "" lower class "" went from 25 % to 32 % .
Actual class slippage mirrors this finding almost exactly :
the 2011 census found that since 2007 , the share of working families with an income less than double the federal poverty line ( the government 's definition of "" low income "" ) rose from 28 % to 32 % .
Referring to "" the middle class "" as a sympathetic totem , or even as an aspirational construct , now runs the risk of alienating voters as much as inspiring or comforting them .
Offering "" protections "" to the middle class might even raise resentments : for a growing number of Americans , that means giving benefits to someone else .
It may be sometime before political rhetoric adjusts to these harsh realities .
I hope that the economy turns around before it has to ."
2013-08-26,"The US will hit its borrowing limit in mid - October and would likely be unable to pay all its bills soon after , the Treasury warned on Monday .
In a letter to Republican House speaker John Boehner that sets the stage for another round of budgetary brinkmanship , Treasury secretary Jack Lew said : "" Congress should act as soon as possible to protect America 's good credit . ""
Lew warned failure to act soon could do "" irreparable harm "" to the US economy .
Government officials and economists had been expecting the US to reach its $ 16.69tn "" debt ceiling "" this autumn , but mid - October is earlier than some had expected .
The news comes as Congress prepares for yet another fight over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling in the coming weeks .
Lew said the Treasury would reach its borrowing limit by mid - October and would then be left to fund the 80 m payments per month , including military salaries and social security cheques , with a cash balance estimated at $ 50bn . ""
Operating the government with no borrowing authority , and with only the cash on hand on a given day , would place the United States in an unacceptable position , "" he wrote .
Lew said it was "" not possible for us to estimate with any precision "" when the Treasury would exhaust those funds if no agreement is reached .
But he said such a situation could rapidly lead to a cash shortfall . ""
Indeed , such a scenario could undermine financial markets and result in significant disruptions to our economy , "" he wrote .
Last month , Boehner said : "" We need significant cuts in spending if we are going to replace the sequester and extend the debt limit . ""
The White House has said that it will not negotiate over whether the borrowing limit should be raised and has called on lawmakers to move quickly .
Political deadlock ahead of a debt ceiling raise in 2011 led to a historic downgrade of US debt and stock market panic .
Lew attempted to see off Republican arguments tying another rise in the debt ceiling to government spending . ""
Extending borrowing authority does not increase spending ; it simply allows the Treasury to pay for expenditures Congress has previously approved , "" he wrote .
"" Failing to raise the debt limit would not make these bills go away , "" he said .
"" It would , though , have disastrous effects for our nation . ""
The government hit its borrowing limit in May , but the Treasury has used emergency measure to buy more time .
The debt ceiling was increased in early August as part of 2011 's Budget Control Act , which also introduced across - the - board "" sequester "" cuts that began in March this year ."
2013-09-18,"Republicans announced a last - ditch budget showdown with Barack Obama on Wednesday , threatening imminent votes that could paralyse the government within weeks if the president does n't postpone his flagship healthcare initiative , cut taxes and permit the Keystone oil pipeline .
Bowing to pressure from his conservative wing , House speaker John Boehner said Republicans would pass a budget bill on Friday that included measures to withhold funding from the Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare .
Both the White House and congressional Democrats however are refusing to blink , raising the prospect of a partial federal government shutdown when current funding arrangements run out at the end of this month .
The Democrat - dominated Senate is expected to reject the House budget and send it back without the healthcare ransom , giving Republicans in the lower chamber one last chance to step back from the brink and agree what is usually a routine extension of government spending permits .
But raising the stakes even higher , House majority leader Eric Cantor told a packed press conference on Capitol Hill that Republicans would also link Obamacare to separate negotiations to extend the US debt ceiling , adding the prospect of theoretical default on government debt repayments to the high - stakes game of bluff .
Cantor said the Republicans would add further demands for tax reform and White House permission for the environmentally - controversial Keystone pipeline to their negotiations over the debt ceiling .
Speaking shortly after the list of demands was unveiled on Capitol Hill , Obama looked visibly irritated at a roundtable meeting with business leaders in Washington and repeated that he would not negotiate with House Republicans .
"" You have never seen in the history of the United States the debt ceiling , or the threat of not raising the debt ceiling , being used to extort a president of a governing party , and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and have nothing to do with the debt , "" he said .
Obama said he was open to negotiating the budget but would refused to "" create a habit , a pattern , whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy .
It is irresponsible .
That last time we did this in 2011
we had negative growth at a time when the recovery was just trying to take off . ""
He added : "" Raising the debt ceiling does not increase our debt , does not somehow promote profligacy .
All it does is it says : you 've got pay for the bills you 've already racked up Congress .
It is a basic function to ensure the fall faith and credit of the US is preserved . ""
He argued Republicans were playing politics and threatening to "" blow the whole thing up "" , default on the debt "" and cause a worldwide financial crisis "" .
Boehner insisted that such tactics were legitimate ways for Republicans to seek influence over government spending , which they say has run out of control . ""
For decades Congress has used the debt limit to cut spending ; this year is going to be no different , "" he said , throwing down the gauntlet to the Senate , which will have to vote on whether to accept the House budget bill .
"" There should be no conversation about shutting the government down .
That 's not the goal here .
Our goal here is to cut spending and to protect the American people from Obamacare .
It 's as simple as that .
There 's no interest in our part in shutting the government down . ""
"" I am not going to predict what the Senate will do , "" added Boehner when asked what would happen if the House budget was rejected .
But Boehner appeared to acknowledge he had been forced into the stand - off by more radical members of his party .
Asked if the decision to directly link defunding Obamacare with the budget negotiations was something he was personally in favour of , he smiled and said : "" We have got a lot of divergent opinion in the caucus but the key is to listen . ""
Speaking after the press conference , Boehner 's aides were adamant that the House leadership had always planned to attack Obamacare during the budget negotiation , even if a direct linkage in one bill was not made until today .
Majority whip Kevin McCarthy insisted there was plenty of appetite in the party for a final showdown over the budget and debt ceiling .
"" I have not watched our conference so united as we walked into this battle , "" he said .
"" You are going to see a very big excitement coming in the next weeks . ""
Previous battles between Republicans and Obama over fiscal policy have been averted in recent months by last - minute deals , but these appear to have weakened the GOP leadership and left the initiative with an increasingly dominant Tea Party wing in House ."
2013-10-01,
2013-10-07,"Barack Obama has challenged Republican speaker John Boehner to prove his theory that there is n't enough Congressional support to end the government shutdown by allowing a "" clean "" budget vote in the House of Representatives .
As the shutdown drags into a second week , pressure is mounting on Boehner after he gave his first interview since the crisis to explain why the House Republican leadership had so far resisted voting on the so - called continuing resolution passed by the Senate last month .
"" There are not votes in the House to pass a clean CR , "" Boehner told ABC on Sunday , claiming there was also similar opposition to extending the debt limit unless the White House was prepared to make concessions over healthcare . ""
The votes are not in the House
â€
¦
We are not going down that path , "" he added .
But various unofficial counts carried out independently in Washington indicate between 21 and 24 Republican congressmen have said they are willing to vote with 198 Democrats in favour of such a bill â€ “ just clear of the 217 needed to pass legislation .
Speaking to reporters during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Monday , Obama seized on the electoral math to turn tables on Boehner . ""
If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes , then they should prove it , "" said the president .
"" Let the bill go to the floor and let 's see what happens .
Just vote .
Let every member of Congress vote their conscience and they can determine whether or not they want to shut the government down . ""
Instead Democrats claim Republicans are reluctant to allow a vote because they know they will lose and therefore cede any political leverage over unrelated issues such as healthcare reform .
"" I heard over the weekend ... this notion that Congress does n't have the capacity to end this shutdown , "" added Obama .
"" My suspicion is â€ “ my very strong suspicion is that there are enough votes there , and the reason that Speaker Boehner has n't called a vote on it is because he does n't , apparently , want to see the government shutdown end at the moment unless he 's able to extract concessions that do n't have anything to do with the budget .
"" A new poll by Associated Press published on Monday suggested the American people also increasingly hold Republicans to blame for the stand - off .
The survey released by the Washington Post and ABC News showed disapproval of Republicans has risen to 70 % , up from 63 % a week earlier .
Disapproval of Obama 's role was statistically unchanged at 51 % .
Boehner insists House Republicans have repeatedly asked for negotiations over ending the shutdown and curbing the health care law , only to be turned down by Obama and congressional Democrats .
"" The president 's refusal to negotiate is hurting our economy and putting our country at risk , "" Boehner said as a new debate began in the House on Monday .
The uncompromising talk rattled financial markets on Monday as stocks slumped .
China , which holds $ 1.277tn in US Treasury bonds and stands as the United States ' biggest foreign creditor , urged that all efforts are made to avoid a default .
Gene Sperling , a senior Obama economic adviser , reiterated a vow not to negotiate on the debt because it would sanction the threat of default as a bargaining chip and increase the chance of default in the future .
Senate Democrats are drafting legislation to raise the nation 's debt limit without the type of unrelated conditions Republicans have said they intend to demand , officials said Monday .
The emerging measure is designed to assure no repetition of the current borrowing squeeze until after the 2014 elections .
Depending on the Republican response , it could be the middle of next week before a final vote is taken on the measure , close to the 17 October deadline that Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has set for Congress to avert a possible default .
Gene
Sperling was pressed on whether he would rule out a two- or three - week extension on increasing the nation 's $ 16.7tn debt limit .
"" There 's no question that the longer the debt limit is extended , the greater economic certainty there will be in our economy which would be better for jobs , growth and investment , "" Sperling told a breakfast sponsored by the newspaper Politico . ""
That said , it is the responsibility of Congress to decide how long and how often they want to vote on doing that . ""

2013-10-11,"White House talks with Republicans failed to reach an agreement to end the budget crisis on Thursday evening , but a marked change in tone from the particiants suggested a deal to end the protracted standoff could finally be in sight .
Discussions between Barack Obama and House speaker John Boehner broke up after 90 minutes with no specific agreement , but both sides said discussions would continue to prevent the US defaulting on its debt obligations .
Earlier , Boehner sent stock markets soaring by offering to pass a temporary six - week extension to the US debt limit that the Treasury estimates will be reached on 17 October .
Republicans are also under pressure to lift their refusal to pass a separate spending authorisation , which precipiated a partial shutdown of the government , leading to the lockout of an estimated 800,000 federal workers .
Obama has insisted on at least a temporary reprieve from both threats before he would agree to negotiate over Republican demands to repeal his healthcare reforms and cut spending .
On Thursday night , it appeared the president had chosen to stand his ground , although the language was less hardline than earlier .
In a statement , the White House said : "" After a discussion about potential paths forward , no specific determination was made .
"" The president 's goal remains to ensure we pay the bills we 've incurred , reopen the government and get back to the business of growing the economy , creating jobs and strengthening the middle class . ""
Some initial reports claimed the president had rejected Boehner 's debt ceiling offer outright , but the White House statement left open the possibility that a deal was near . ""
The president had a good meeting with members of the House Republican leadership this evening , "" added the statement .
"" The president looks forward to making continued progress with members on both sides of the aisle . ""
Republican leaders told CNN they had "" a good honest discussion "" that did not lead to a "" yes or no "" from the president .
Nevertheless Senate Democrats were sceptical about accepting the Republican offer of talks until the threat of continuing government shutdown was also removed . ""
Not going to happen , "" declared majority leader Harry Reid , standing outside the White House after he and fellow Democrats met with Obama before the Republican meeting .
Earlier White House officials had given a cautious welcome to the Republican offer , but stressed they would need to see the exact wording before deciding if it was enough to proceed with formal talks .
The president is "" happy that cooler heads seem to be prevailing , "" said spokesman Jay Carney , adding : "" We would prefer to see a longer term resolution .
"" Republicans have been under intense pressure from business leaders and party donors to avoid a possible US default by removing the debt ceiling threat from their arsenal .
But there is no guarantee that the more conservative Republicans in Boehner 's caucus will support it .
US stock markets soared on news of a deal .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 323 points higher ( up 2.18 % ) .
The S&amp;P 500 rose over 36 points ( 2.26 % ) .
Keith McCullough , CEO of investment adviser Hedgeye , said investors had been nervous about the talks .
"" I changed by views on the US markets three times yesterday .
That ca n't be good for anyone , "" he said .
"" People are sick and tired of Boehner , Obama , Bernanke or whoever dominating the markets . ""
He said he was hopeful that Washington would now concentrate on "" larger issues "" like cutting back on the Federal Reserve 's massive economic stimulus programme rather then these "" sideshows "" .
PNC Bank senior economist Gus Faucher said : "" This is an indication at least that we will get a deal on the debt ceiling .
That 's what has been worrying investors more than the government shutdown . ""
Faucher added , however , that the uncertainty was already a drag on the economy , and failure to reach a deal on the debt limit would have a "" significant negative and long - lasting impact "" .
Earlier on Thursday the Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned there were unpredictable consequences of the continued brinksmanship , including the possibility that the US could run out of cash within days .
Lew accused Republicans of underestimating the danger of inadvertently triggering a stampede among investors that could rapidly drain remaining reserves .
More than $ 100bn ( Â£63bn ) of the US debt , known as Treasury bonds , is typically reissued every week as investors roll over their loans to the government .
This process is usually routine and does not add to the $ 17tn US debt pile , but simply refinances a portion of it .
But markets have already been spooked by Republican threats to refuse to extend the debt limit if they do not extract concessions on healthcare reform .
Short - term borrowing costs nearly tripled in a bond auction on Tuesday as investors feared there was a risk that interest and capital repayments could be missed .
A similar wariness to roll over bonds expiring next week could exhaust a $ 50bn cash reserve at any point , warned Lew .
"" Trying to time a debt limit increase to the last minute could be very dangerous , "" he said in written congressional testimony .
"" If US bondholders decided they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll over their Treasury investments , we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance . ""
Answering written questions by members of the Senate finance committee , he added : "" I very much fear that miscalculation is something that could have devastating consequences .
It is impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy when we will run out of money . """
2013-10-15,"Republicans in Congress who forced a two - week government shutdown and took the country to the brink of a possible default will meet on Tuesday morning for what will be a pivotal moment for the last - ditch efforts to resolve the crisis .
Unless a deal to raise the US debt limit is struck in the next 48 hours , senior administration officials have warned that the US would be unable to pay creditors , an unprecedented situation that economists warn could precipitate the country 's first ever default â€ “ an economic disaster that could ripple across the world .
John Boehner , the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , was scheduled to test how inclined the GOP conference is to endorsing the imminent deal forged in the Senate , in a meeting scheduled for 9 am ET .
Although not yet finalised , the Senate proposal would reportedly reopen the government and extend the US borrowing limit for another three or four months .
The agreement , being finalised between Senate majority leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart , Mitch McConnell , was not expected to contain any proposals that come close to satisfying the demands of Tea Party hardliners , who set out two weeks ago to block or significantly undermine Barack Obama 's healthcare reforms .
The conservative wing of the Republican party in the House holds considerable sway of the leadership , and Tuesday 's meeting , held in the basement of the Capitol building , will be a crucial test of how many members are prepared to cave .
It should shed light on whether Boehner , under enormous pressure to avert a potential economic catastrophe should the US default , would hold a vote on any Senate deal without the backing of most of his party .
Senate Republicans and Democrats were scheduled to meet their respective leaders separately on Tuesday morning to discuss the possible deal , before it is publicly announced .
Without an increase to the debt ceiling authorised by Congress , the US Treasury will lose its authority to borrow money to pay its debts .
Even if Reid and McConnell announce a deal early on Tuesday â€ “ and quickly move to a vote in the Senate â€ “ time will fast be running out to pass a vote in the second chamber .
On Monday , Obama postponed a 3 pm White House gathering of congressional leaders after it became clear that McConnell and Reid were close to a deal and needed extra time to fine - tune a package and test the water among their respective parties .
Both men made positive noises upon emerging from their negotiating sessions , though without anything concrete to show .
McConnell said he was optimistic that a deal acceptable to both sides was within reach , and Reid went further , saying he hoped an outcome would now be sealed that would reopen the government .
Negotiators were in talks late into the night on Monday , and any agreed framework could yet change .
However , there were multiple reports that the two senior senators had agreed a package which would involve funding the government until 15 January , a stopgap measure that would allow for extensive negotiations over government spending levels .
The debt ceiling would also be raised , but only until early- or mid - February , according to the reports .
There may be some other small concessions relating to relatively minor tweaks to aspects of the Affordable Care Act , but the healthcare law , which came into force the day the shutdown began , would remain intact .
That is likely to prove a sticking point at Tuesday morning 's meeting of House Republicans , who will have little to show for precipitating the first government shutdown in almost two decades except for a significant drop in popularity revealed by in recent polls .
The 15-day shutdown has paralysed large sections of government since and revealed a deep rift in the Republican party .
The partial closure of government initially led to 800,000 federal employees being furloughed , although 400,000 military workers were later recalled .
In addition to the mothballing of key government departments and agencies , national parks , memorials and public lands across the US have been closed , proving particularly damaging to some rural economies â€ “ many of which are in Republican districts .
The ambition of Tea Party Republicans was to use the shutdown , and a subsequent refusal to raise the debt limit , as leverage to force the defunding of Obamacare .
That objective that was then relegated to postponing of the so - called individual mandate â€ “ a key component of the law that compels individuals to get insurance .
The deal now being mooted on Capitol Hill , which is also said to contain components of a proposal first raised by Republican senator Susan Collins , falls well short of either of those GOP House demands .
It would also fail to lock in automatic spending cuts , known as the sequester , beyond January â€ “ a goal some Republicans had hoped they would achieve .
Hardliners are already indicating they will vote against any deal that fails to undermine Obamacare or radically alter the fiscal balance .
These ardent conservatives are also challenging the conventional wisdom â€ “ and testimony from the US Treasury secretary , Jack Lew , that the US would be at high risk of default once its borrowing authority expires on Thursday .
Tea Party Republican Raul Labrador said in a CNN interview on Monday that the deal apparently being reached in the Senate would not get his support .
"" It has nothing to do with Obamacare , "" he said .
"" If there are no systemic changes to our debt , to our entitlement programs , then I would vote no on raising the debt ceiling . ""
However , on Monday , markets appeared optimistic of a last - minute deal in Washington .

2013-11-05,"A landmark bill that would ban workplace discrimination against gay , lesbian and transgender people passed a key vote in the US Senate on Monday , relying on support from a few initially reluctant Republicans .
The procedural vote to move to a Senate debate on the Employment Non - Discrimination Act ( Enda ) , viewed as a key test of support for the bill , passed the Senate by 61 votes to 30 , one more than required .
But the prospects of the bill eventually becoming law were dealt a blow when the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , John Boehner , said he did not support it . ""
The Speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs , especially small business jobs , "" Boehner 's spokesman , Michael Steel , said .
Boehner had previously avoided committing to a position on the legislation , and his opposition was a setback for supporters of the bill .
Barack Obama strongly supports Enda , and , in an op - ed piece published by the Huffington Post yesterday , said millions of LGBT Americans currently went to work fearful of losing their jobs .
"" It 's offensive .
It 's wrong .
And it needs to stop because , in the United States of America , who you are and who you love should never be a fire - able offence , "" the president wrote .
Obama compared the battle over Enda to efforts to end discrimination against women and religious and racial minorities .
"" Passing Enda would build on the progress we 've made in recent years , "" he added .
"" When Congress passes it , I will sign it into law , and our nation will be fairer and stronger for generations to come .
"" The procedural move in the Senate required 60 votes to ensure that conservative Republicans could not block it .
In total , seven Republicans joined all the members of the Democratic majority , including three who appeared to hesitate .
The vote was delayed as Republican senators Kelly Ayotte , Pat Toomey and Rob Portman met in the Republican cloak room , just off the Senate floor , where they were lobbied by the legislation 's backers .
Those involved in the a last - minute attempt to persuade the Republican trio included Harry Reid , the Democratic majority leader , and his deputy , Chuck Schumer .
All three Republicans eventually voted for the measure , ensuring it scraped through , after apparently negotiating future amendments in exchange for their support .
The fact the vote received the backing of moderate Republicans , as well as Democrats from conservative states who in previous years might have felt obliged to vote no , revealed that social attitudes in the US are changing , though slowly .
Another wavering Republican Senator , Dean Heller , had announced earlier in the day that he would back the bill , which would make it illegal for a firm in any US state to sack an individual because of their gender identity or sexual orientation .
Heller , a senator from Nevada â€ “ which is one of 22 states to have banned workplace discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation
â€ “ described his decision to support the bill as "" the right thing to do "" .
He added : "" This legislation raises the federal standards to match what we have come to expect in Nevada , which is that discrimination must not be tolerated under any circumstance . ""
The Senate last voted on Enda in 1996 , when it failed by one vote .
The proposed legislation has become a touchstone issue , revealing the fissure between the moderate and more conservative wings of the GOP .
Gay and transgender advocacy groups consider the bill a critical step towards equal rights in the US .
They have had the support of Susan Collins , the Republican senator from Maine who has tried to lobby colleagues to back the bill .
However , conservative Republicans have expressed discomfort with a bill that would afford new federal rights to gay and transgender people , claiming that , if enacted , the law would enable unwarranted lawsuits .
A recent study by the Government Accountability Office â€ “ the audit , evaluation and investigative arm of Congress â€
“ found the existing state - level anti - discrimination laws had led to "" relatively few "" legal actions ."
2013-12-12,"As you may have heard , Time magazine just plastered the pontiff on its cover as person of the year .
Some of us in the US take that to mean that , indeed , the meaning of life is not about how many securitized derivative products you can create that will cause the collapse of banks and financial markets .
Nor is it about how many government shutdowns you can mastermind , or how many food stamps you can take from the hands of the hungry and poor .
Hark the herald angels are finally singing , one of whom is â€ ¦ tada !
John Boehner .
The Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , who earlier this fall shrugged his shoulders at a corporatist - led shutdown of the federal government , appears to have gotten the pope 's memo .
Or maybe Representative Paul Ryan passed the pope 's memo to Boehner .
Ryan , the former GOP vice presidential candidate has also shirked his Tea Party masters by authoring a budget deal that will stave off any more shutdowns and defaults , at least for two years .
When asked this week if the modest US budget deal worked out by Ryan and Democratic Senator Patty Murray deserved to be immediately blasted by conservative groups , Boehner delivered his own scathing bit of fire and brimstone :
You mean the groups that came out and opposed it before they ever saw it ?
That was just the warm up .
Boehner then expanded on his sermon by unmasking the GOP civil war that has not only plummeted the Republican party into a death spiral but also hijacked Congress by keeping it from doing any meaningful work on behalf of the American people .
They are using our members and they are using the American people for their own goals .
This is ridiculous .
Listen , if you 're for more deficit reduction , you 're for this agreement , Boehner said .
We 're thankful this holiday season that Boehner has decided to ( finally ) declare that the emperor has no clothes ; that the Koch brothers , Ted Cruz , the Club For Growth , Dick Armey and Freedom Works are now the Wizards of Oz left standing naked before us .
The American people deserve to see just how it is that the so - called "" grassroots "" movement called the Tea Party was long ago co - opted by these billionaire corporatists .
Never mind that nagging voice inside our heads that begs the question : where was this version of Boehner three months ago ?
Did he develop a conscience and a spine in two months ?
Can a merlot hangover produce some long overdue cut - the - crap honesty ?
Or maybe it was the pope , because some of us consider the Time magazine cover of an alms - delivering pontiff and Boehner 's political epiphany as very good signs , even if they 're simply , oddly , coincidental .
In a time when the anti - government forces got a little too close to being "" in charge "" of Congress during the $ 24bn - in - lost - revenues - courtesy - of - Ted - Cruz 's shutdown , some of us have even had a fleeting , flirtatious idea about converting to Catholicism .
A world leader who is willing to call the end game of capitalism antithetical to humanity ?
What ?
When did the Vatican take over the wheels of John McCain 's straight - talk express ?
Boehner 's latest "" outburst "" is so out of left field , so refreshing , that some of us wonder whether Boehner 's brain and Twitter accounts might have been hacked .
So far , it does n't appear to be that way .
There are no retractions , no capitulating to the campaign - donor captors who threaten primaries against Republicans who dare to make deals with Democrats .
Today , Boehner went back to the congressional leader 's pulpit and expanded on his civil - war - cracking diatribe against the handful of rich people who are trying to goad an entire nation to work against the interests of a majority of its people .
As he said : You know , they pushed us into this fight to defund Obamacare â€ ¦
It was n't exactly the strategy I had in mind .
But if you recall , the day before the government re - opened , one of the people at one of these groups stood up and said , ' well we never really thought it would work . '
Are you kidding me ?
No , sir .
You 've got to be kidding us .
Even since the days after Boehner and Barack Obama went golfing and tried to cook up the grand bargain , Boehner toddled away from the reservation called procedural and policy sanity .
However , in the spirit of Nelson Mandela 's forgiveness , which the South African leader granted his jailors , we 'll forgive Boehner , who has finally emerged from a three - years - long , Club - For - Growth - induced coma .

House speaker John Boehner signalled a major break from right - wing conservatives on Thursday when he accused activist groups of losing â€œall credibilityâ€ � by opposing his efforts to reach a deal with Democrats over the $ 1tn federal budget .
Heritage Action , a group behind many Tea Party Republicans , issued a testy response on Friday , claiming Boehner was trying to clear the way for immigration reform next year by severing his links with opponents on the right of the party .
Some conservative commentators , such as Red State blogger Erick Erickson , have even speculated this was the prime motivation behind Boehner 's surprise attack on the right , describing it as the â€œfirst real shotsâ€
� in the party 's forthcoming battle over immigration .
Boehner 's office was not immediately available for comment on Friday , and there were plenty of other grounds for the falling out , but experts familiar with immigration reform point to a number of recent developments which suggest he is preparing to work with Democrats on the issue in the new year .
Perhaps most significant is Boehner 's appointment last week of a high - profile immigration expert , Becky Tallent , who previously worked for senator John McCain when he last tried to pass comprehensive immigration reform under President George W Bush .
â€œIt seems very unlikely that Becky would have gone to work for the speaker on this unless there was a serious plan to move on this in the new year , â€ � Ted Alden , an immigration specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations , told the Guardian .
There was a similar key switch of personnel at the White House on Friday , which came as it signals a new willingness to meet Boehner halfway on immigration reform when the House returns after Christmas .
Miguel Rodriguez , the director of legislative affairs who led Obama 's efforts to get immigration reform through the Senate , became the first senior White House official to lose his job this year when he was replaced by congressional veteran Katie Beirne Fallon .
Democrats have hinted at important concessions on immigration in recent days , most noticeably when Obama said he was relaxed about a preference among House Republicans to vote on each piece of the reform package separately rather than adopt the single bill passed by the Senate .
And Democratic congressman Luis GutiÃ © rrez , a key advocate of reform in the House , indicated his party may even be prepared to drop its desire to see a path toward full citizenship for undocumented immigrants , settling for basic legal status instead , in order to achieve a deal with Boehner .
â€œSome have suggested that the way you thread the needle for Republicans between the immigration reform the country wants , which includes a path to citizenship , and the Republican 's number - one priority , which is opposing what President Obama is for , is to offer a compromise that includes something less than citizenship , â€ �
he told the Migration Policy Institute in Washington last week .
â€œI do n't think this is a good idea because citizenship is important , but I do n't think it is a big deal - breaker either.â€ �
In another sign of an impending climbdown on the issue of full citizenship , or â€œamnestyâ€ � as Republicans refer to it , GutiÃ © rrez added : â€œDemocrats have to put policy ahead of politics .
If we as a party go the route of what is best for us politically in the short run , there is very little incentive to resolve the immigration
issue.â€ �
Republican leaders , especially those with presidential ambitions , have said they are keen to show progress toward legalisation to counter a dramatic drop in the party 's popularity among Latino voters , but are sceptical of moves that would add more potential Democratic voters to the voting roll if they were granted full citizenship .
The piecemeal approach to legislation favoured by the House could therefore allow Boehner to strip out more radical citizenship proposals in the Senate bill and keep enough moderates on board to live without his party 's Tea Party hardliners ."
2014-01-24,
2014-01-30,"Republicans leaders have unveiled a set of principles for immigration reform that would permit millions of undocumented immigrants to remain in the country , but deny them a special gateway to citizenship .
The speaker of the House , John Boehner , shared the principles among fellow Republican members of Congress at a retreat in Cambridge , Maryland on Thursday , as part of an effort to rehabilitate the party 's reputation for obstructionism .
The principles were contained in a loosely - worded document that left the door open to giving America 's 11 million undocumented workers legal status that would allow them to live and travel in the country .
Crucially , the document suggests a simultaneous push to improve border security .
Previously , conservatives insisted borders should be made more secure before any changes to immigration law are made .
"" There will be no special path to citizenship for individuals who broke our nationâ€ ™ s immigration laws â€ “ that would be unfair to those immigrants who have played by the rules and harmful to promoting the rule of law , "" the document stated .
"" Rather , these persons could live legally and without fear in the US , but only if they were willing to admit their culpability , pass rigorous background checks , pay significant fines and back taxes , develop proficiency in English and American civics , and be able to support themselves and their families ( without access to public benefits ) . ""
Undocumented immigrants who were brought to US soil as children â€ “
so - called â€œDREAMersâ€ �
â€ “ would however be given a route to full citizenship .
The prospect of granting illegal immigrants a status that falls short of full citizenship rights will alarm some reform campaigners , who are warning it could create a sub - class .
However , the principles mark a shift from the previous position taken by House Republicans , who are showing a rare appetite for compromise .
Marielena HincapiÃ © , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center , said the changes â€œwould go a long way toward fixingâ€ � Americaâ€ ™ s immigration system , but added that it was "" unclear whether these core members of our society will eventually be able to earn citizenship "" .
"" What happened today in Cambridge is a historic breakthrough , "" said Tamar Jacoby , a Republican who favours immigration reform and is president of the advocacy group ImmigrationWorks .
Jacoby said that while "" vigorous debate "" in the party over the proposals was now inevitable , the principles themselves constituted a significant shift in Republicans ' approach to immigration . ""
Strong voices from across the Republican spectrum agree with the fundamental point â€ “ the nation , and the GOP , need to act on immigration.â€ � â€¢ This article was amended on 31 January 2014 to correct the attribution of a quote ."
2014-02-06,"The prospects for meaningful reform to the US immigration system were dealt a blow on Thursday as House speaker John Boehner warned that any legislation â€œwould be difficult to pass this yearâ€ � .
Boehner had raised expectations in the White House that a deal was achievable after criticising more conservative colleagues late last year for opposing his efforts to reach consensus on bipartisan issues .
But the GOP leadershipâ€ ™
s
attempt to apply this to the vexed question of legalising Americaâ€ ™ s 12 million undocumented migrants appears to have stalled just days after Boehner proposed a compromise measure to his colleagues at a Republican party retreat in Maryland .
This plan would have sought to give legal recognition to undocumented migrants , but not the path to full citizenship that Democrats have sought and that was contained in a bipartisan Senate bill that passed last summer .
Such a compromise would have been difficult to reach even with such a deal , because many Democrats fear it would create a â€œtwo - tierâ€ � workforce .
It has also proved impossible to sell to conservative Republicans .
Speaking to reporters in Congress on Thursday , Boehner said the efforts had stalled because there was a â€œlack of trustâ€ � among his members in Obamaâ€ ™ s ability to deliver other aspects of the immigration reform package such as tighter border security .
â€œFor the past 15 months , Iâ€ ™ ve talked about the need to get immigration reform done .
Itâ€ ™ s an important issue in our country
thatâ€ ™ s been kicked around forever and needs to be dealt with , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œHaving said that , we outlined our principles last week to our members â€ “ principles that our members , by and large , support â€ “ [ but ] the American people , including many of my members , donâ€ ™ t trust that the reform weâ€ ™ re talking about will be implemented as intended to be.â€ �
Boehner said Obamaâ€ ™ s history of changing how healthcare reform was implemented was the major factor â€œand itâ€ ™ s going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes.â€ � White House spokesman Jay Carney insisted Obama had a track record of delivering on border control , pointing to increased numbers of security staff .
â€œThe presidentâ€ ™ s record on border security has been well documented and testified to by Republicans and Democrats , â€œ he said .
â€œWe are going to keep working on [ passing reform ] and think there has been significant progress .
We are confident that Republican leaders , and people who officials listen to , like business , strongly support immigration reform .
We are going to get this done .
Itâ€ ™ s not going to be easy but 2014 presents the best opportunity we have ever had.â€œ Republicans initially feared that failure to pass immigration reform would hurt their chances of attracting non - white voters in elections , but increasingly the party seems to have decided that making an issue of Obamaâ€ ™ s competency is an electoral asset .
â€œThe big theme for us in the midterms is not going to be Obamacare , but Obamaâ€ ™ s
competency
, â€ � one GOP campaign official told the Guardian on Wednesday .
â€œThe problems with Obamacare are the best example of that , but we want to convince voters that it goes much further than that.â€ �"
2014-02-09,"For a while there it looked like John Boehner , the embattled House Speaker , had finally reined in the fanatical Tea Party wing of his caucus .
After all , it was just two months ago when Boehner wrangled 169 Republican votes â€ “ with just 62 dissenting â€ “ to approve the Bipartisan Budget Act and avoid taking the government over the fiscal cliff in January .
And as recently as last week it was Boehner who unveiled a "" statement of principles "" designed to win support for his biggest legislative priority of 2014 : an immigration bill .
We can work with the White House on this one , he indicated time and again .
That was then .
Now , the old John Boehner â€ “ the Boehner of shutdowns , obstructionism and capitulation to the far right â€ “ is back .
All of a sudden this Boehner doubts there will be an immigration bill this year , and it 's â€ “
shocker â€ “ all Barack Obama 's fault .
"" Listen , there 's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws , "" Boehner said Thursday .
"" The American people , including many of my members , do n't trust that the [ immigration ] reform that we 're talking about will be implemented as it was intended to be . ""
Of course , this statement , ostensibly about immigration , is really about the Affordable Care Act , the bÃªte noire of the Republican Party and the one issue it has obsessed over for the last five years .
House Republicans , who hate the ACA and have held more than 40 failed votes to repeal it , complain that Obama 's selective enforcement of the law means that he would apply similarly loose standards to any immigration bill .
In other words , we hate Obamacare â€ “ but why are n't you enforcing it ?
Republicans have a point .
The President has acted on his own to change the timeline for implementing parts of the healthcare law ; they also worry about Obama 's vow to go around Congress whenever possible with a flurry of executive orders .
But on this latter point , the GOP 's memory is selective .
Hardliners bellow that Obama has run amok with his executive orders , seemingly ignoring the fact that the 167 orders Obama issued in his first five years in office pale in comparison to their hero Ronald Reagan 's 256 at the similar point in his presidency .
Facts , as John Adams was fond of saying , are stubborn things .
In any case , the White House dismisses all of this and throws the blame right back in the GOP 's face .
"" I think that the challenges within the Republican Party on this issue are well known and they certainly do n't have anything to do with the president , "" press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday with his trademark smirk .
The calculus in the West Wing is that Republican infighting can only benefit the President .
Why the about face on immigration for Boehner ?
His hold on the Speaker 's gavel is tenuous ; there could be a challenge next January when the new Congress is sworn in , and he wants to protect his flank from far right attacks .
Boehner also knows that if the GOP stalls , it will be dealt a stronger hand come January : midterm elections almost always favor the party that is not in control of the White House and this November promises to be no different .
As things look now , Republicans are likely to add between four and six seats to their already substantial House majority ( they currently number 232 to the Democrats ' 200 ) , and there is a 50 - 50 shot of them picking up the six seats they need to retake the Senate .
Boehner 's new reasoning : Why not wait ?
Come January , we can strike an even better deal .
Whether it 's a better deal for the focus of any immigration bill â€ “ Hispanics â€ “ is doubtful ; some 40 % of House Republicans fiercely oppose granting permanent residency to undocumented immigrants ( "" illegals "" in GOP speak ) .
There is a third reason for stalling on immigration .
Republicans want Obamacare to be the singular focus for the November midterm election ; they 're sure it 's a winner for them .
It very well could be .
The Real Clear Politics average of all recent polling says just 38 % of Americans approve of Obamacare with 52 % disapproving .
The president 's overall job performance is similarly lackluster , with 43 % approving , and 52 % disapproving .
But what Republicans do n't seem to realize is that unhappiness with Obamacare should not be construed as an endorsement of them or their hardline tactics .
A recent poll showed that only an anemic 17 % of Americans approved of the performance of GOP leaders .
Republicans cackling at Obama 's poor numbers is akin to the captain of the Titanic poking fun of someone else 's poor seamanship ."
2014-02-11,"Republican leaders backed away from a confrontation with the White House over the US borrowing limit , conceding on Tuesday that their party was too divided to press their demand for concessions from the administration in return for raising the debt ceiling .
John Boehner , the Republican speaker of the House , told fellow lawmakers he would quickly bring legislation to increase the Treasuryâ€ ™ s debt limit , without any extraneous requests attached .
The so - called â€œcleanâ€ � debt bill , set to be put to a vote later on Tuesday , marks a capitulation from Republicans to Senate Democrats and the Obama administration , who have been insisting on the measure for weeks .
Even with Democratic support , Republicans in the House will need to muster at least 18 votes to pass the bill , which extends the Treasuryâ€ ™ s borrowing capacity to enable it to pay debts associated with spending that Congress has already approved .
Passage of the clean debt bill had been pencilled in for Wednesday , but Boehner expedited the process because of an impending snowstorm .
That third and final vote on the debt limit extension was expected at 6.45pm on Tuesday evening , giving Republicans just a few hours to secure the backers from their party .
If even a small number of Democrats vote against the legislation , passage of the bill could be complicated .
The US government has been using what it calls â€œextraordinary measuresâ€
� to keep its accounts rolling since Friday .
The Treasury secretary , Jack Lew , had warned Congress that those measures would soon expire , saying the debt ceiling would need to be raised by 27 February to avoid a possible default .
With the House due to embark on a two - week recess , that left just a handful of days to increase the debt limit or risk default .
The White House steadfastly refused to negotiate with Republicans , saying they were holding the economy to ransom .
Republican leaders , conscious their party has a reputation for obstructionism â€ “ which was compounded during last Octoberâ€ ™ s failed debt limit fight â€
“ showed no enthusiasm for another showdown with the White House in an election year .
Still , they openly â€ “ if half - heartedly â€ “ toyed with making approval for an extended debt ceiling contingent on a number of different proposals , such as approval of the the Keystone XL pipeline or attacks on aspects of Obamaâ€ ™ s signature healthcare law .
Neither idea gained much traction , and on Monday night , Boehner presented a last - ditch proposal linking the debt ceiling rise to the re - introduction of military pension benefits , which had been cut from the recent budget .
By Tuesday morning , it was evident that Republicans were unwilling to rally around that idea .
A GOP source confirmed that Boehner told fellow Republicans in a private meeting that he would table a vote a clean debt limit bill , a move that will require an overwhelming majority of Democrats to pass .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve all known that our members are not crazy about voting to increase the debt ceiling , â€ �
Boehner later told reporters , according to Politico .
He added : â€œWeâ€ ™ ll let the Democrats put the votes up ; weâ€ ™ ll put a minimum number of votes up to get it passed.â€ �
The saga underscores the disarray in the Republican party and mirrors Boehnerâ€ ™ s recently stalled push for immigration reform .
He and other leaders had hoped to pass measures before the summer that would enable a path to legal recognition for undocumented workers .
Top GOP legislators presented their plans at a Republican retreat last month , portraying the move necessary in order to rebrand the party and improve its appeal to Hispanic voters .
Less than a week later , Boehner conceded the pitch did not go down well with rank - and - file members , saying immigration reform â€œwould be difficult to pass this yearâ€ � .
Boehner tried to blame his immigration U - turn on lack of trust in the Obama administration .
On Tuesday , he adopted a similar approach when trying to explain the debt limit surrender .
â€œOur members are also very upset with the president , â€ �
he said .
â€œHe wonâ€
™ t negotiate .
He wonâ€ ™ t deal with our long - term spending problems without us raising taxes .
He wonâ€ ™ t even sit down and discuss these issues .
Heâ€
™ s the one driving up the debt and the question theyâ€ ™ re asking is , why should I deal with his debt limit?â€ �
Despite Republican infighting , Washington has experienced a flurry of bipartisan legislative progress over the past month , passing the budget , appropriations and farm bills in relatively quick succession .
Presuming the debt limit legislation passes â€ “ which is not guaranteed , given the strength of GOP opposition to a clean bill and the limited time needed to find the votes â€ “ Congress should have created the space for other , non - essential legislation in the spring .
However , with the midterm elections nine months away , Republicans do not want to rock the boat with bills that could prove politically unpopular with their base ."
2014-04-08,"A bipartisan attempt to restore unemployment insurance to more than two million out - of - work Americans appeared likely to fall victim to deadlock in Congress on Tuesday .
The Senate passed legislation on Monday night that would temporarily extend lapsed emergency assistance measures that were first introduced after the banking crash , in exchange for reforms designed to curb fraud and claims by the very rich .
But the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , John Boehner , said on Tuesday that he would not allow a vote on the bill without additional measures to stimulate job growth .
The bill , which passed the Senate by 59 - 38 with the support of six Republicans , seeks to address earlier concerns raised by House leaders by including proposals to pay for the extension through a separate reform of employee pension obligations .
But on Tuesday , Boehner 's spokesman Michael Steel told the Associated Press that the House leadership was only â€œwilling to look at extending emergency unemployment insurance as long as it includes provisions to help create more private sector jobs "" , something he said Senate Democrats were refusing to do .
At a press conference on Tuesday morning led by House majority leader Eric Cantor , the issue was not even addressed , and Congress will shortly break for Easter .
Moderate Republicans in the Senate have not given up on hopes of passing some form of unemployment insurance , but concede privately that they face a constantly shifting set of concerns from colleagues in the House .
One staffer told the Guardian that senator Dean Heller , a Nevada Republican whose home state has some of the worst unemployment rates in the country after the collapse of its construction bubble , was now seeking a meeting with House leaders to attempt to meet their outstanding concerns .
But conservative Republicans and many Democrats are more pessimistic about the prospects of moving forward on an issue that highlights the deep divide between the parties on how to address growing economic inequality and insecurity .
Some Republican activists claim the Senate is trying to â€œbullyâ€ � the House into following its lead on something that many members of the House of Representatives do not see as a pressing issue in their home districts .
The federal insurance program is aimed at long - term unemployed workers whose state assistance has expired but was itself left to lapse in December , after Congress failed to agree to extend it during broader budget negotiations .
Efforts to find a temporary solution to fund the program have foundered , despite continued high US unemployment rates ."
2014-05-07,"Conservative Republicans are gunning for House Speaker John Boehner â€ “ from his three primary opponents , whom he beat easily on Tuesday , to his own Number 2 , to the conservative newbies trying to keep their tea partying constituents happy .
But liberals should enjoy Boehner while they still can .
After 64 years on earth , four of them in high school and eight in the House Republican leadership , it is difficult to imagine that Boehner could hear any new double entendres about his last name .
This election cycle might have been the first time that someone used one against him in a campaign ad .
One of those three opponents , JD Winteregg , appealed to voters searching for a cure to "" electile dysfunction "" .
Winteregg lost his job teaching at a Christian college over the stunt â€ “ and did n't even come close to besting Boehner when the totals came in Tuesday night across Ohio .
Winteregg is not the only Republican to take a below - the - belt swing at the speaker .
Actually , most of John Boehner 's true enemies are Republicans , like his pun - slinging primary opponent â€ “ and they 're almost just as subtle .
Boehner 's most obvious enemies in the House are the Tea Party agitators â€
“
they 're the ones who crow to reporters about his betrayal and openly plot coups .
And he 's not interested in the same issues as the Tea Party members , a former colleague tells me : "" I do n't think he even likes them . ""
The speaker 's sense of self - preservation is well - honed enough that I believe he will likely escape the machinations of his compatriots .
Unlike the rebellion that brewed under Newt Gingrich , the Tea Party froth comes from a distinct ( if vocal ) subculture within the party , rather than the GOP rank - and - file .
Most of the critics are members of the House "" Liberty Caucus "" , and largely talk amongst themselves rather than actively solicit the support of less radical representatives .
Still , that does n't mean Boehner 's planning to hold on to the gavel for another two years .
As another of his former colleagues told me : "" He has the loyalty of too many people to get voted out , but he does n't want his legacy to be the guy that oversaw the 100th failed effort to repeal Obamacare . ""
In other words , John Boehner 's legacy would n't be the 100th failed effort to repeal Obamacare â€ “ it would be turning into the guy smart enough to leave after the 99th .
But Boehner 's most dangerous enemy is the man standing next to him at press conferences : Eric Cantor .
The majority leader benefits from being able to play that podium - sized distance between him and Boehner as a wide gulf ; even more to the point , he benefits from being the one to hand out checks to upstarts .
Cantor has his hand in not one but two "" leadership PACs "" , helming his own
Every Republican Is Crucial ( see what he did there ? )
PAC , which gave twice as much â€ “
$ 1.5 m â€ “ to GOP candidates this cycle as Boehner .
This spring , Cantor moved quickly to capitalize on the McCutcheon campaign finance decision to form a "" joint fundraising committees "" and benefit from the new upper limit on campaign donations from a single person ( which went from $ 48,600 to $ 2.2 m in the wake of the ruling ) .
Boehner , by comparison , spent a meager $ 715k on the campaigns of other members , which is a sign of either supreme self - confidence or apathy about his future .
And as unease about Boehner from the far right has grown , Cantor has reportedly been willing to capitalize on their discontent and install a tea partier as his own deputy to get the votes to unseat Boehner as the next speaker of the House .
Cantor wants the job , but he has n't actually endeared himself to the tea partiers whose support he needs to get it , as evidenced by disgruntled conservatives ' threats to withhold their votes on Paul Ryan 's budget to protest Cantor 's "" sneaky "" move on the Medicare "" doc fix "" vote .
His disloyalty to Boehner and willingness to cut a deal for the top spot means they do n't see him as the "" enemy of their enemy "" so much as someone without any loyalties whatsoever .
But if not Cantor or some Tea Party favorite , who could actually succeed Boehner ?
The lack of other obvious choices shows there 's no one for his internal opposition to coalesce behind .
What Republican is popular enough , politically savvy enough and brave enough to try and herd those House cats ?
The smart and savvy seem singularly uninterested : up - and - comers Jeb Hensarling and Jim Jordan , for instance , have repeatedly denied any such ambitions .
And who can blame them ?
As one former member put it : "" You would have to be a serious masochist to want that job . ""
That just leaves the loose cannons that no sane Republican really wants in charge : Speaker Louie Gohmert , who postulated that the Aurora massacre happened people do n't pray at high school graduations ; Speaker John Culberson , who compared the congressmen that shut the government down to the heroes that charged the cockpit of United flight 93 ; or , Speaker Paul Broun , who has accused Obama of plotting an armed takeover and called evolution "" lies straight from the pit of hell "" .
That is perhaps the fondest home of some Democrats â€ “ and some political writers : for the Republicans to install someone so out - there to most Americans that the entire party would be tainted going into the 2016 presidential election .
But liberals should be careful what they wish for .
Wacked - out culture warriors make for good fundraising appeals and Upworthy videos , but polarizing an electorate does n't necessarily move those in the middle to one side or another â€ “ they usually wind up just dropping out .
What 's more , a truly dedicated obstructionist force of cultural conservatives in the House could slow down not just legislation , but the country 's entire economic recovery : Boehner may be a roadblock to extending unemployment benefits , but at least the economy is what he wants to talk about .
Friends even say that Boehner would be happy to talk about only the economy .
It seems hard to believe that we could ever look back fondly on the past four years : just consider the record - level unpopularity of Congress , the unprecedented gridlock and the willingness of many of its members to simply walk out on their jobs .
But considering what we might expect from a the Tea Party Reign , the whole Boehner Era might take on a familiar sepia tone .
We could even miss him when he 's gone ."
2014-07-01,"President Barack Obama on Tuesday defiantly mocked a lawsuit being brought against him by one of his chief Republican opponents , summarising his reaction to claims of presidential overreach as : "" so sue me "" .
The Republican speaker of the House , John Boehner , announced last week that he planned to file a lawsuit to challenge Obama over his alleged misuse of presidential powers .
Republicans have long complained that Obama is overstepping his authority by acting unilaterally , rather than with Congress , on issues as varied as GuantÃ¡namo Bay , changes to Obamacare and immigration enforcement .
During a brief speech on the banks of the Potomac River in Washington , Obama dismissed his critics , saying Republican obstructionism left him no alternative , and singling out the House GOP conference as a block to any legislative action . ""
They criticise me for this ? "" he said .
"" So sue me .
As long as they 're doing nothing , I 'm not going to apologise for doing something .
"" Obama made the remarks in front of Washington 's Key Bridge , the scene of an imminent construction project â€ “ one of thousands of road infrastructure projects his administration says it would invest in if it could get Republican backing to do so .
The federal Highway Trust Fund , which supports construction projects across the country , will expire at the end of the summer unless it is reauthorised by Congress .
The White House wants to pay for the fund , which it claims would enable 700,000 jobs , by closing corporate tax loopholes .
Republicans equate that to a tax hike , but have not ruled out finding other ways to pay for the road - building and maintenance scheme .
The president accused them of being more interested in protecting unfair advantages enjoyed by America 's rich .
Obama often gives addresses about the economic hardship suffered by everyday Americans â€ “ typically during trips outside of the Beltway that also feature after - dinner speeches to an array of rich Democratic donors .
In his speech on Tuesday , the president adhered to his familiar script ; the economy is improving , he said , but not fast enough .
Obama has for months been saying that growing inequality of opportunity is undermining the American dream , but his administration has been unable to persuade Republicans in the House to seek any substantial legislative remedy .
His critics argue his penchant for grand speeches is rarely matched by a concerted effort to forge compromise with his opponents on Capitol Hill .
Unemployment remains stubbornly high at 6.3 % , and repeated attempts by Democrats in Congress to pass a bill to restore unemployment benefits for the long - term jobless and increase the federal minimum wage have failed .
Obama was speaking on during the week of the Fourth of July , when millions of Americans will take to the roads . ""
Soon , states may have to choose which projects to continue and which to put the brakes on because they are running out of money , "" Obama said .
The president said almost every other advanced industrial money spends a greater portion of its budget on basic infrastructure projects .
"" Its not crazy .
It 's not socialism , "" he said .
"" It is not the imperial presidency . ""
Calling on Republicans to commit to funding infrastructure projects , he said : "" It is not like they 've been busy doing other stuff . ""
When the crowd laughed , he added : "" No , seriously !
They 're not doing anything .
Why do n't they do this ? """
2014-07-10,"Relations between Republicans and Barack Obama appeared to plumb new depths on Thursday evening as the House speaker , John Boehner , launched a lawsuit against the president for failing to consult Congress before taking executive action to adjust implementation of the Affordable Care Act .
Following on from threats that have been mounting for several months , Boehner began a process that may end up in the supreme court and sought the backing of House representatives to sue the president for allegedly breaching their constitutional rights .
The resolution focuses specifically on changes made to Obamacare that , ironically , delayed or removed certain controversial requirements for employers .
Republicans claim the changes are indicative of a broader failure to consult Congress on other contentious policy issues such as immigration . ""
In 2013 , the president changed the healthcare law without a vote of Congress , effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it , "" Boehner said in a statement .
"" If this president can get away with making his own laws , future presidents will have the ability to as well , "" he added .
"" The House has an obligation to stand up for the legislative branch , and the constitution , and that is exactly what we will do . ""
Obama , who announced a strategy of taking more executive actions during his state of the union address , has publicly dared Boehner to take him to court .
He again ridiculed the notion in a speech earlier on Thursday , claiming he was merely filling a vacuum left by an obstructionist Congress .
"" You hear some of them â€ “ ' sue him ' , ' impeach him ' , "" said Obama .
""
Really ?
Really ?
For what ?
You 're going to sue me for doing my job ?
Okay .
I mean , think about that .
You 're going to use taxpayer money to sue me for doing my job while you do n't do your job . ""
Rather than wage another political stunt that wastes time , wastes taxpayers ' money , I 've got a better idea : do something , "" he added .
"" If you 're mad at me for helping people on my own , let 's team up .
Let 's pass some bills .
Let 's help America together . ""
Boehner , whose resolution must first clear the House rules committee next week , is likely to have been emboldened by a series of recent rebukes by the supreme court over Obama 's executive powers , including the ability to make senior government appointments when the administration determines the Senate is in recess .
In a statement issued after Boehner 's announcement , the White House added : "" It is disappointing that Speaker Boehner and Congressional Republicans have decided to waste time and taxpayer dollars on a political stunt . ""
At a time when Washington should be working to expand economic opportunities for the middle class , Republican leaders in Congress are playing Washington politics rather than working with the president on behalf of hardworking Americans .
As the president said today , he is doing his job â€ “ lawsuit or not â€
“
and it 's time Republicans in Congress did theirs . """
2014-07-15,"Serious lawsuits start with some specific legal grievance â€ “ a claim that someone was injured by a defective product , say , or that a search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment â€ “ and proceed from there .
US House speaker John Boehner wants to sue the President of the United States â€ “ for no particular reason other than his alleged lawlessness â€ “ and fill in the details later .
The lawsuit , which a House committee will take up rather seriously on Wednesday , is a frivolous stunt that not only has no chance of succeeding but is n't even intended to succeed .
The belated choice of targets does provides a useful illustration of Republican priorities , though : most notably , registering more outrage at the Affordable Care Act and further attempting to legitimize various fake scandals wafting up from the conservative fever swamp .
Some of the GOP attacks on the Obama administration have had real substantive effects .
This suit , however , is analogous to the endless House votes to repeal Obamacare â€ “
an impotent symbolic gesture by Republicans frustrated they were unable to deny access to health coverage to tens of millions of American citizens .
By speaking first in general terms about Obama 's alleged failure to "" faithfully execute the laws "" in favor of usurping the will of Congress , plus the president 's failure to do enough bombing of random foreign countries , Boehner allowed the Tea Party 's insatiable skree machine to fill in its own gibberish legalese .
Why focus on one potential impeachable offense when the examples can be nearly infinite ?
Benghazi !
Fast and Furious !
Executive orders !
Now that Boehner has actually announced the basis for the lawsuit â€ “ and will spend the next two weeks getting it to the floor for another meaningless Obamacare vote â€ “ it turns out to be a narrow and almost certainly irrelevant one .
The suit will focus on a claim that Obama acted illegally when the administration decided to effectively delay implementation of the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act , by declining to penalize employers who did n't comply in 2014 .
In fairness , the argument is n't unreasonable on its own terms , but to bring a legal challenge in federal court , a plaintiff must have "" standing "" â€ “ Boehner and Co must show that the House of Representatives has been directly injured or otherwise directly affected .
Under existing precedents , that 's nearly impossible .
And even if the federal courts were to grant standing , for a lawsuit to proceed , there has to be an ongoing controversy .
Since the employer mandate will almost certainly not be delayed another year , the issue is likely to be moot before the lawsuit gets very far , which will result in its getting thrown out .
The American taxpayers will have funded a no - hope legal challenge because House Republicans needed to keep their base 's 24/7 scandal - invention machine going â€ “ not because there was an actual controversy .
It 's not clear what kind of bill the coming weeks might produce .
Conservative legal experts will be happy to give testimony , some of which will be reflected in the final resolution .
But the details are fundamentally irrelevant .
The federal courts will almost certainly deny that they have jurisdiction , Boehner will have sent politically expedient signals to his base , and the successful implementation of Obamacare will proceed exactly as it would have â€ “ as if nobody had ever sued the President of the United States at all .
As for the defective product that is the Republican - controlled House , well , the only remedy for the injuries they 've inflicted is at the ballot box in November ."

2014-09-11,"Congressional leaders shrugged off concerns over the legality of White House plans to bomb Isis in Syria on Thursday , agreeing instead to grant separate authorisation to train and equip rebels in votes scheduled for next week .
â€œWe ought to give the president what heâ€ ™ s asking for , â€ � said House speaker John Boehner despite admitting some concern among fellow Republicans that Obamaâ€ ™ s military plans may not go far enough to defeat the Islamic State fighters known as Isis .
â€œAn
F-16 is not a strategy .
And air strikes alone will not accomplish what weâ€ ™ re trying to accomplish , â€ � he added .
â€œAnd the presidentâ€ ™ s made clear that he doesnâ€ ™ t want US boots on the ground .
Well ,
somebodyâ€ ™ s boots have to be on the ground.â€ � Senior Democrats were less enthusiastic about further US escalation but equally adamant that the president was right to seek military escalation in the region without a vote in Congress .
â€œHe has the legal authority .
I know he does .
Iâ€ ™ ve studied the issue for a very long time , â€ � said House minority leader Nancy Pelosi .
â€œItâ€
™ s up to Congress to rally around Obama and his decisive strategy , â€ � added Senate leader Harry Reid .
â€œThis is the time for America to close ranks and engage our adversaries as one united nation.â€ � Only at the edges of both parties
was there any suggestion that the president may be overstepping his authority by launching open - ended strikes in Syria and Iraq without first seeking congressional approval .
â€œI believe any expanded US military role beyond air strikes in the fight against Isis in Iraq must be approved by Congress , â€ � said Colorado Democrat Mark Udall .
â€œThe American people must be assured that we are not pursuing another open - ended conflict in the Middle East , and I will not give this president â€ ” or any other president â€
” a blank check to begin another land war in Iraq.â€ � Tim Kaine of Virginia also questioned whether there should formal war authorisation beyond that already granted after 9/11 , though he acknowledged the president â€œmade a strong case on the need to degrade and destroy Isis.â€ �
Among Republicans , there was more concern about whether relying on moderate Syrian rebel groups to help defeat Isis would be enough .
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann , who is standing down in November , said she would not vote in favour of any bill authorising US training for the groups out of fears they were allies of Isis rather than enemies and she questioned whether so - called â€œboots on the groundâ€ � could be avoided â€œWhether they are called advisers or not , they still have boots on , â€ �
she said .
â€œAmerican boots are on the ground.â€ �
Another hawkish Republican , New York congressman Peter King , said he thought the US battle against Isis was likely to go on â€œanother 10 to 15 yearsâ€ � .
A House vote allowing the Pentagon to spend $ 500 m training and equipping Syrian rebel groups
â€ “ known as article 10 authorisation â€
“ is likely to take place early next week , followed by a Senate bill later in the week .
Boehner said there had yet to be a decision among House Republicans on whether it would be included alongside other budget measures in a previously planned continued resolution , or whether it would be voted on separately .
But few were in any doubt that Congress would stand in the way of the presidentâ€ ™ s desire to expand strikes in Syria and Iraq .
â€œI expect the proposal to pass Congress by the end of next week , â€ � said Reid ."

2014-09-28,"My colleague Ed Pilkington reports that a senior Republican is putting pressure on President Obama to commit American troops against Isis .
Here is an extract .
The Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , John Boehner , on Sunday ramped up the political rhetoric over Syria and Iraq by saying American forces will need to be put on the ground in the battle against the Islamic State ( Isis ) .
Boehnerâ€ ™ s comment that at some point â€œboots have to be on the groundâ€ � marks a significant inflation in the terms of the debate over how to deal with Isis .
President Barack Obama has repeatedly said US ground forces will not be used in the conflict , which on Sunday saw US - led strikes in Syria and the first British strikes in Iraq , though the Pentagon has ordered the dispatch of 1,600 US troops to Iraq for what it insists will be training and other support functions .
Isis shelled the town centre of Kobani in a Kurdish enclave in Syria on the border with Turkey .
Refugees have been fleeing across the border .
Reporters on the Turkish side saw no evidence of air strikes from the US - led coalition .
David Cameron hinted that he wants to extend the fight against Isis to Syria and only a lack of political consent at Westminster is holding the government back .
Labour said a â€˜much more cautiousâ€ ™ approach was needed in Syria and it â€˜canâ€ ™ t just give a blank cheque to the governmentâ€ ™ .
RAF planes returned from their first strike sorties over Iraq after not finding targets .
Military figures have criticised British air strikes as insufficient .
Barack Obama said US intelligence services underestimated Isis activity inside Syria , which has become â€œground zeroâ€ � for jihadists worldwide .
The US strategy , said the US president , is to push Isis back , shrink its space , go after its command and control , its weapons , its fuelling , cut off its financing , and work to eliminate the flow of foreign fighters .
Coalition planes destroyed at least three makeshift oil refineries in jihadist - controlled territory in Syria .
The planes struck close to the Turkish border , near the town of Tal Abyad , just across from the Turkish town of Akcakale , according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in the UK .
In the comment piece by Patrick Cockburn cited earlier , he explains why the US has been tardy in bombing Isis around Kobani .
Strangely , until yesterday the US was using its airpower everywhere in Syria except Kobane where Isis has launched its most serious offensive since US air attacks on Syria began .
It has seized 64 villages , using tanks and artillery barrages from guns captured from the Iraqi and Syrian armies .
Why the American reticence ?
It appears to be motivated by a wish not to offend Turkey which never cared for the semi - independent Kurdish cantons , home to many of Syriaâ€ ™ s 2.5 million - strong Kurdish minority , that have grown up across its southern border since 2011 .
Its actions are strong evidence that Ankara can see the advantages of using Isis against the Kurds .
Reporters on the ground on the Turkish side of the border say that Isis militants still found it easy last week to cross backwards and forwards , unlike Turkish Kurds wanting to fight Isis .
An observer in Turkey asks the question : â€œWhy Isis fighters are still being taken across the border into Turkey to be treated in hospital for their combat wounds , when medical staff treating non - violent but injured protesters in Gezi Square are put on trial for â€˜assisting terrorismâ€ ™ ?â€ �
Map of Kobani , the Kurdish enclave in Syria near Turkey .
US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State ( Isis ) activity inside Syria , President Barack Obama said today on the CBS TV network .
This is from Reuters .
Conversely , the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups , Obama said in a â€œ60 Minutesâ€ � interview taped on Friday , days after the US president made his case at the United Nations for action .
Citing earlier comments by James Clapper , director of national intelligence , Obama acknowledged that US intelligence underestimated what had been taking place in Syria .
Islamic militants went underground when US Marines quashed al - Qaida in Iraq with help from Iraqâ€ ™ s tribes , he said .
â€œBut over the past couple of years , during the chaos of the Syrian civil war , where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned , they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos , â€ �
Obama said according to a clip of the interview broadcast earlier .
â€œAnd
so this became ground zero for jihadists around the world.â€ � Obama outlined the military goal against Islamic State : â€œWe just have to push them back , and shrink their space , and go after their command and control , and their capacity , and their weapons , and their fuelling , and cut off their financing , and work to eliminate the flow of foreign fighters.â€ � Isis seems to be advancing on the city of Kobani , Jenam Moussa tweets .
Writing on the Daily Beast webiste , Dean Obeidallah , an Arab - American comedian and commentator argues for the need for mainstream Muslims to challenge Isisâ€ ™ s ideology .
Hereâ€ ™ s an extract .
We need to counter Isis with Islam .
We are truly witnessing a clash of civilisations .
But itâ€ ™ s not between the West and the Islamic world .
Itâ€ ™ s between Islam and Isis .
While ISIS potentially poses a threat to the United States , to many Muslims living in the Middle East , Isis is a clear , present , and immediate threat .
Isisâ€ ™ s philosophy is in reality not â€œsubmit to Islam or dieâ€ � ; after all the group is slaughtering Muslims daily .
Itâ€ ™ s â€œsubmit to Isis or die.â€
�
Nothing is a greater motivator than self - preservation .
The fight against groups like Isis will likely be with us for years .
No doubt that a military component must be part of this approach .
But to really cut off Isisâ€ ™ s pipeline of recruits and financial support from Muslims , it requires that we not view Islam as the problem , but actually as a big part of the solution .
Jenan Moussa from Arabic Al Aan TV is on the Syrian - Turkish border .
John Boehner , the Republican speaker in the House of Representatives , has doubts about Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s strategy .
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine tells the CBS news show Face the Nation that President Obama needs the consent of Congress before starting military action .
Ed Pilkington , my colleague in New York , has more details on the latest air strikes in Syria , led by the US , but involving several Arab countries .
The raids were the first in the Kobani region , where Syrian Kurds have come under attack from Isis .
US - led forces have attacked new targets in eastern Syria and along the Syrian border with Turkey , in an attempt to disrupt Islamic State ( Isis ) oil supplies and halt the militantsâ€ ™ relentless advance through Kurdish villages .
In Iraq , meanwhile , British jets carried out bombing missions for the first time .
Monitoring groups reported that a fresh wave of strikes had been launched on Saturday and into Sunday morning in the eastern province of Raqqa and in the Kobani region along the Turkish border .
The bombing raids were led by the US , but the Pentagon stressed the involvement of Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates .
The Obama administration is keen to portray the assault on Isis as being carried out by a broad coalition that includes Arab states , rather than as a replay of unilateral US intervention in the Middle East .
The Kobani strikes were the first in an area that has seen Isis advance through Syrian Kurdish villages , forcing an exodus across the border into Turkey of at least 150,000 people .
Kurdish leaders in both Syria and Iraq have pleaded with the US - led coalition for more than a week to do something to impede the militantsâ€ ™ advance through a rural area with a population of about 400,000 .
The air assault was relatively modest , destroying a building and two armoured vehicles , according to US central command .
Ojlan Esso , spokesman for the Syrian Kurds in Kobani , said 35 Isis fighters were killed in the strikes .
Isis has a gruesome reputation , but that is no barrier to satire .
Here are a couple of examples .
The first is from the Lebanese humourist , Karl Sharro .
The second is entitled : Five ways for Isis to reduce its carbon footprint .
It includes the advice to eat locally .
â€œInstead of wasting fuel to transport food , it would be more efficient - and delicious!- for Isis militants to stick to the local fare of each new city they conquer.â€ � Patrick Cockburn , the Independentâ€ ™ s veteran Middle East watcher , argues that air strikes have an important but limited role .
There is a role in Iraq and Syria for foreign airpower to act as a fire brigade to stop Isis from storming Irbil in August or taking Kobane ( the Kurdish enclave in northern Syria ) now .
But go beyond this limited but important role and air strikes swiftly become counter - effective ...
What Britain should be doing in addition to sending the Tornadoes is to do everything possible to get negotiations going between the main outside players in the Iraq - Syria crisis .
These would include the US , Russia , Saudi Arabia and Iran as well as inside players such as the Syrian government , Syrian Kurds and non - Isis opposition to Assad .
The only way to eliminate Isis long term is to look for a way of de - escalating the crisis so that local parties do not all feel that they are fighting for their lives .
Isis is essentially a war machine , and so long as the Syrian war goes on it can not be beaten .
Nigel Farage , the Ukip leader , has ridiculed the governmentâ€ ™ s decision to strike Isis in Iraq from the air .
Ukip is cock - a - hoop after a second Tory MP , Mark Reckless , defected to Farageâ€ ™ s party .
Here is Farageâ€ ™ s statement on the need for a ground war to defeat Isis .
I am pleased to discover that I find myself in near complete agreement with such an eminent and experienced man as General Lord Richards .
Both on the impossibility of defeating Isis militarily through airpower alone and on our need to bring Putinâ€ ™ s Russia into the alliance against radical Islam , General Richardsâ€ ™ thinking mirrors was what I was saying this week in Doncaster .
The governmentâ€ ™ s position in merely attacking a cross border force on one side of the border is laughable .
Isis is not merely a terrorist organisation , and no amount of wishing that will make any difference .
It is an embedded society .
To defeat it will take far more than airstrikes .
If we are to combat Isis it will take a hard fought ground war .
To rely on airpower alone risks making a bad situation far worse .
David Cameron gives broadest hint yet that he wants to extend the fight against Isis to Syria and only a lack of political consent at Westminster is holding the government back .
Labour says a â€˜much more cautiousâ€ ™ approach was needed in Syria and it â€˜canâ€ ™ t just give a blank cheque to the governmentâ€ ™ .

Iraqi forces say they repelled a jihadist attack near Baghdad , AFP reports .
Iraqi pro - government forces backed by warplanes on Sunday repelled a jihadist attack on a strategic town only 40 km ( 25 miles ) west of the capital Baghdad , security sources said .
The Islamic State ( IS ) group attacked Amriyat al - Fallujah in Anbar province at around 1:00 am ( 2200 GMT on Saturday ) , local police chief Aref al - Janabi told AFP .
â€œThey attacked from two sides ...
The fighting lasted five hours , â€ � he said , adding that soldiers , policemen and Sunni tribesmen were fighting together to defend the town .
Warplanes eventually engaged the insurgents and killed 15 of them.â€ �
According to Janabi , the IS military leader in the nearby city of Fallujah - whom he named as Mullah Jassem Mohammed Hamad - was killed leading the attack .
A military intelligence officer at the operations command for Anbar province also reported the IS leaderâ€ ™ s death .
It was not immediately clear which air force intervened but French and US jets have carried out air strikes in areas west of Baghdad .
Unlike the restive city of Fallujah , which was out of government control even before a major IS push inside Iraq in June , the smaller town of Amriyat al - Fallujah has remained in government hands .
Citizens for Bahrain , which identifies itself as an online moderate movement , has roundly condemned Isis , which recently sent a video message calling on Bahrainis to join the group .

Bahrain has carried out air strikes against Isis in Syria as part of the US - led coalition .
The group has issued this statement .
The people of Bahrain despise and reject you because you have brought our sacred Islamic faith into disrepute .
Every senior Islamic scholar around the world has made clear that your words and actions contradict the simplest teachings of Islam .
Forced conversions , murdering non - combatants , torture , rape , killing aid workers and journalists , issuing fatwas without qualifications .
The people of Bahrain despise and reject you because of your attempts to mislead and brainwash our youth .
Those who travel to fight for Isis can expect to witness and perpetrate unspeakable and ungodly acts and to die a pointless and shameful death .
We hope and pray that the best of our young people are immune to your crazed and contradictory message .
The people of Bahrain despise and reject you because of your hatred for women .
Which branch of Islam preaches mass rape , forced marriage , sexual slavery and murdering unarmed women and children including Muslims and non - Muslims ?
The ascendance of Isis has given rises to some of the worst abuses that humanity has witnessed .
We have watched brave women Kurdish fighters opposing you and our esteemed Emirati sisters taking to the skies to launch bombing raids against ISIS .
We promise you that the women of Bahrain would be only too proud to do likewise in taking a stand against ISIS , if given the chance .
Germany has started training 32 Kurdish peshmerga fighters at an army school in Bavaria to support them in their fight against Isis , reports the Associated Press .
A spokesman for the German defence ministry said Sunday that the 32 Kurdish fighters would stay in Germany until October 3 to receive weaponsâ€ ™ training .
Germany also began delivering arms to the Kurds in northern Iraq on Thursday , sending a shipment of 50 hand - held anti - tank weapons , 520 G3 rifles and 20 machine guns .
In total , the German plan calls for arming 10,000 Kurdish fighters with some â‚¬70 m worth of equipment .
Germany is also sending some 40 paratroopers to help train the fighters on the weapons .
US Central Command in Tampa , Florida has released this video of an air raid against an Isis building near Kobani , Syria on Saturday .
Vernon Coaker , the shadow defence secretary , has outlined Labourâ€ ™ s reservations on British action in Syria although it supported the US - led air strikes .
He told Sky Newsâ€ ™ Murnaghan programme that a â€œmuch more cautiousâ€ � approach was needed in Syria and â€œwe canâ€ ™ t just give a blank cheque to the governmentâ€ � .
â€œWe have supported the US air strikes with Arab coalition partners in Syria .
What we say though , itâ€ ™ s not only a question of legality , itâ€ ™
s a question of legitimacy
, itâ€ ™ s a question of keeping that coalition together , keeping as many of those Arab states in the region as possible together and understanding what it is we are actually trying to achieve .
That is why alongside that we have said , as well , the pursuit of the route through the United Nations is also important.â€ � William Hague , the former foreign secretary , said UK action against Isis in Syria must not hinge on calls for UN security council backing as Russia and China would block action .
â€œWe are not going to come to the House of Commons with a motion on Syria that is just going to be knocked back , â€ � he told Pienaarâ€ ™ s
Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live .
â€œThere isnâ€ ™ t yet a political consensus on taking action , but we havenâ€ ™ t excluded that .
They have said it would be highly desirable to have a United Nations security council resolution .
To which I say - and I have long experience of the UN security council dealing with Russia and China - that we wouldnâ€ ™ t get a resolution to take military action against ( IS ) in Syria because of Russian objections .
So that really canâ€ ™ t be the thing that we get hung up on .
â€œBut this is a subject that we might have to return to.â€ � Labourâ€ ™ s decision to oppose military strikes against the Syrian regime last year - leading Cameron to abandon the proposal after suffering defeat in the Commons - had â€œemboldenedâ€ � the westâ€ ™ s enemies , Hague said .
David Cameron has given his broadest hint yet that he wants to extend the fight against Isis to Syria and only a lack of political consent at Westminster is holding the government back , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s political editor , Patrick Wintour .
The prime minister said he was sympathetic to the argument mounted by the former chief of the defence staff Sir David Richards that Isis had to be defeated in Syria , as well as Iraq .
The former army general told the Sunday Times : â€œyou can not possibly defeat IS by only tackling them in Iraq .
How the well do you win the war when most of your enemy end up in a country you can not get involved inâ€ � .
Cameron , speaking on the BBCâ€ ™ s Andrew Marr Show , said : â€ �
I have a lot of sympathy with that view which is why I have said we support what the Americans and the five Arab nations have done in Syria .
We have a Syria strategy which is to build up the Free Syrian Army , The Syrian National Coalition to achieve a political transition in Syria .
But I wanted to take the House of Commons a proposals that I could achieve consensus with to make sure Britain was playing its role in this co - ordinated action across both partiesâ€ � .
Cameron said he agreed that boots on the ground were needed but insisted they must not be British ones .
â€œWe are not trying to defeat Isil from the air alone .
We believe you do need troops on the ground but they should be Iraqi troops , they should be Kurdish troops .
We are part of a large international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy this organisation .
But it canâ€ ™ t be done unless the countries where this organisation has grown up play their part in destroying it.â€

Michael Fallon , the defence secretary , said the government would keep open the option of returning to parliament to seek permission to extend air strikes into Syria .
â€œIS is based in Syria , it has been attacking Iraq from Syria , and it needs to be defeated in Syria as well as Iraq , â€ � he told Skyâ€ ™ s Murnaghan programme .
â€œWe have not taken a decision on that yet .
It is something we are going to review .
We will see how that campaign goes , but in the end ( IS ) do have to be defeated in Syria .
The Americans are there with their air strikes , the other Gulf nations have come in as well to help them , obviously we shall have to keep under review whether we should be there too.â€ � Ed Miliband , the Labour leader , has argued that any action in Syria should be preceded by an attempt to secure a UN security council resolution .
However , the shadow foreign secretary , Douglas Alexander , said last week such a resolution was not indispensable to future Labour support , a position that would have handed a veto to Russia , one of the five permanent members of the UN security council .
This article from the Foreign Policy website in the US underlines the difficulties of trying to hit Isis from the skies .
It appeared on Friday .
Just four days after the United States began a campaign of airstrikes in Syria to destroy the forces of the self - proclaimed Islamic State , the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s strategy is showing signs of backfiring and may be losing the support of some of the people it needs most to succeed .
In a pointed statement issued Friday , a group that supports moderate Syrian rebel forces said it â€œcondemnsâ€ � the US bombing campaign because it hasnâ€ ™ t been planned in consultation with rebels on the ground , who could help direct American aircraft toward Islamic State fighters .
Some rebel forces claimed that US - led airstrikes have killed civilians , and theyâ€ ™ re also accusing Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s administration of taking its eyes off the main target - the Islamic State - to go after other militant groups that , while considered enemies of the United States , are nevertheless fighting the regime of Bashar al - Assad .
The US strikes could be having an unintended effect , rebels say : propping up Assad and weakening the opposition to him and the Islamic State .
The airstrikes are happening â€œwith absolutely no coordination with moderate opposition forces on the ground , â€ � stated the Coalition for a Democratic Syria , which represents several Syrian - American nonprofit groups in the Unites States and maintains daily communications with rebel forces .
The US military has no combat forces in Syria and relies heavily on footage from surveillance drones , manned aircraft , and spy satellites to track the movements of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
Because the United States has no intention of deploying ground troops , the Syrian rebels have to do that job , acting as the Americansâ€ ™ eyes and ears . ...
Syrian rebel sources complain that US - led bombing has barely dented the Islamic Stateâ€ ™ s strongholds .
In the city of Raqqa , where the group has its headquarters , fighters fled in advance of the first wave of bombings early Tuesday morning , Sept. 23 , and relocated to the suburbs , according to one opposition source who asked not to be identified .
If Islamic State fighters blend in with civilians , it will be far more difficult for the United States to track them from the air .
One opposition supporter in contact with rebel fighters said the lack of coordination from the Pentagon may have led to an inadvertent attack on civilians .
In Bidama , a small town in northern Syria , rebel forces reported Friday that missiles hit a court building and a school , injuring 11 civilians , said Mohammed Ghanem , the director of government relations for the Syrian American Council .
The BBC has an early poll showing strong British public support for UK air strikes against Isis , but these are early days .
The US - led coalition destroyed three makeshift oil refineries in jihadist - controlled territory in Syria early today , a monitoring group said .
This is from Agence France - Presse .
The planes struck close to the Turkish frontier , near the town of Tal Abyad just across the border fence from the Turkish town of Akcakale , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said .
â€œAt least three makeshift refineries under IS ( Isis ) control in the Tal Abyad region were destroyed overnight ,
â€ � the Observatory said .
â€œIS had been refining crude and selling it to Turkish buyers , â€ � said the Britain - based watchdog , which has a broad network of sources inside Syria .
Before the launch of US - led air strikes on IS in Syria last Tuesday analysts say the jihadists were earning as much as $ 3 m a day from oil revenues .
Output from IS - controlled fields stood at 80,000 barrels per day , far exceeding the 17,000 barrels per day the Syrian oil ministry said it was pumping .
The strikes around Tal Abyad came after Saturday raids on the mainly Kurdish town of Ain al - Arab , also very close to the Turkish border .
The town , known as Kobane in Kurdish , has been under assault by IS for more than a week , sparking an exodus of at least 160,000 refugees into Turkey .
The coalition also kept up its raids on the jihadist heartland province of Raqa early Sunday as it pressed what Washington says are â€œnear continuousâ€ � strikes .
The raids destroyed a plastics factory outside Raqa city , killing one civilian , the Observatory said .
Two British former senior military commanders have questioned the policy of air attacks against Isis .
Lord Richards of Herstmonceux , a former head of the UK military who stepped down as chief of the defence staff last year , told the Sunday Times ( paywall ) that Isis would not be defeated by air attacks alone and that a conventional campaign involving ground troops would be needed to defeat them .
â€œUltimately you need a land army to achieve the objectives weâ€ ™ ve set ourselves â€ ” all air will do is destroy elements of Isis , it wonâ€
™ t achieve our strategic goal , â€ � he told the paper .
â€œThe only way to defeat Isis is to take back land they are occupying which means a conventional military operation .
The only way to do it effectively is to use western armies
but I understand the political resistance.â€
� Richard Williams , a former commanding officer of the SAS who served in Bosnia , Iraq and Afghanistan , wrote in the Independent on Sunday the deployment of RAF bombers was a â€œmilitary sugar rushâ€
� that â€œrisks looking fearful and half - cockedâ€ � .
â€œUltimately you need a land army to achieve the objectives weâ€ ™ ve set ourselves - all air will do is destroy elements of Isis , it wonâ€
™ t achieve our strategic goal , â€ � he said .
â€œThe only way to defeat Isis is to take back land they are occupying which means a conventional military operation .
The only way to do it effectively is to use western armies
but I understand the political resistance.â€
�
Lieutenant Colonel Williams emphasised the need for a political solution in Iraq for the air raids to mean anything : â€œAs with all wars fought among a people in a country that is not our own , as in Helmand and Basra , we must get the politics right first , and the fighting has the chance of working .
Get it wrong and we fail.â€ � RAF jets have made their first strike sortie against the Islamic State ( Isis ) terror group .
As two Tornado jets took off from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus , David Cameron said Britain was playing its part in an international coalition aimed at destroying the â€œappalling terrorist organisationâ€ � .
After the jets returned to base seven hours later , the MoD said their first combat mission had not struck any targets .
Officials said the sorties had , however , gathered â€œinvaluable intelligenceâ€ � in the quest to degrade Isisâ€ ™ s infrastructure .
â€œAlthough on this occasion no targets were identified as requiring immediate air attack by our aircraft , the intelligence gathered by the Tornadosâ€ ™ highly sophisticated surveillance equipment will be invaluable.â€ �

2014-10-16,"Republicans are stepping up pressure for travel bans on passengers arriving from Ebola - stricken countries in west Africa , calling for a vote on quarantine measures in the House of Representatives as the US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) acknowledged it was assessing the question â€œon a day - to - dayâ€ � basis .
The White House and senior US health officials continue to insist such measures would be counter - productive because they would hamper efforts to control the Ebola epidemic at its source , but the growing clamour from critics in Congress means the issue is becoming a major political battleground in Washington .
During the first hearing into the administrationâ€ ™ s handling of the crisis in Washington on Thursday , a succession of Republican congressmen joined the House speaker , John Boehner , in calling on the administration to urgently review its opposition to tighter travel restrictions .
Michael Burgess , a Texas Republican and doctor of obstetrics and gynaecology who is the vice - chair of the subcommittee that held the hearing , said it was time for the full commerce committee to propose a vote on quarantine measures in the House .
Such a vote is highly unlikely to force the administrationâ€ ™ s hand unless there is overwhelming support in the Senate as well , but the call for it points to the growing politicisation of the Ebola threat in the run - up to next monthâ€ ™ s midterm elections .
â€œThis should not be represented as an all - or - none choice , â€ � said the subcommittee chair , Tim Murphy , a Pennsylvania Republican .
â€œWe can and will create the means to transport whatever supplies and goods are needed in Africa to win this deadly battle .
We do not have to leave the door open to all travel to and from hot zones in western Africa while Ebola is an unwelcome and dangerous stowaway on these flights.â€ �
An unofficial list created by The Hill claimed 34 Republicans and five Democrats have already declared themselves in favour of travel bans .
The border protection officer John Wagner told the hearing that there are no direct flights from Sierra Leone , Guinea or Liberia to the US , meaning that any quarantine measures would have to apply to passengers travelling via other countries .
Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , testified at length that any such travel restrictions would encourage travellers from Africa to hide their travel information and make it harder to check them for fevers when they arrive in the US .
â€œWe want to make sure that individuals who are travelling to the United States are monitored â€ ¦ and screened appropriately , â€ � added the White House spokesman , Josh Earnest , in a separate daily media briefing .
But in comments to reporters the FAA administrator , Michael Huerta , suggested there was still an ongoing debate within the administration on whether to change the policy in response to growing fears about the risk of Ebola transmission within the US .
â€œWe are now working together and assessing this on a daily basis , â€ � Huerta said at an event in Washington .
â€œCDCâ€ ™ s determination is that a travel ban in and of itself doesnâ€ ™ t address the challenges that we have here , â€ � he added .
â€œBut this is something that we continue to monitor.â€ �
Asked if he had discussed a ban with the White House , Frieden said , â€œWe have had discussions on the issue of travel to and from west Africa.â€ �
He added that he would not rule out a ban entirely , saying :
â€œFrom the CDCâ€ ™ s perspective we will consider anything that will increase the safety of Americans.â€ � Screening measures introduced on 11 October at JFK airport in New York have led to eight passengers undergoing testing there .
Similar systems were put in place at Dulles outside Washington DC , Newark and Chicago airports on Thursday ."
2014-11-06,"The Republican speaker of the House , John Boehner , has warned Barack Obama he is â€œinviting big troubleâ€ � by using his presidential authority to reform the immigration system , setting the scene for the first major collision between the parties after the midterm elections .
Striking an uncompromising tone at his first press conference since a wave of Republican congressional victories on Tuesday , Boehner said there would be â€œno chanceâ€ � of legislation to mend the countryâ€ ™ s immigration system if the president acted alone .
â€œWhen you play with matches , you take the risk of burning yourself , â€ � he said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to burn himself if he continues to go down this path.â€
�
The White House responded to Boehnerâ€ ™ s comments by insisting that the president was undeterred , and would pursue â€œcommon sense and substantiveâ€ � executive action on immigration .
On Wednesday , the president pledged to take that action before the end of the year .
Boehner failed repeatedly over the last year to persuade Republicans in the House to even countenance a package of immigration reforms that the partyâ€ ™ s leadership believe is necessary .
He was not drawn on whether he could guarantee a vote on immigration reform but said he would talk to his members in coming weeks and signalled his determination to revisit the issue .
â€œIt is time for the Congress of the United States to deal with a very difficult issue in our society , â€ � he said .
â€œThis immigration issue has become a political football over the last 10 years or more .
Itâ€ ™ s just time to deal with it.â€ � Boehner and Mitch McConnell
â€ “ the Kentucky senator who will take over as majority leader in January after the GOP gained eight seats in the chamber â€ “ will meet the president for lunch on Friday .
It will be their first encounter since Republican electoral gains reshaped the balance of power in Washington .
As well as regaining control of the Senate , Republicans have gained at least 13 seats in the House , where they already enjoyed a large majority .
Boehner , who is expected to overcome any challenge to his leadership , will begin the 144th US Congress with the largest majority of any Republican speaker since at least the 1940s .
He promised to use that position of strength to push for a simplified tax code , reduce the national debt and repeal the presidentâ€ ™ s signature health reforms in the Affordable Care Act .
In a gesture to rightwingers in their party , Boehner and McConnell identified the repeal of Obamacare as a key legislative priority in a joint op - ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday .
Boehner has already allowed more than 50 House votes to amend or repeal Obamacare since 2010 .
He conceded at his press conference that another vote to fully repeal the law was unlikely to succeed beyond the House , but insisted there would also be separate attempts to seek smaller alterations to the law .
â€œJust because we may not be able to get everything that we want ,
doesnâ€ ™ t mean that we shouldnâ€ ™ t try to get what we can , â€ � he said .
The press conference , however , was dominated by immigration , which threatens a major confrontation between the parties .
A bipartisan , comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate , which combined border security and provided a path to citizenship to the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the US , was passed in 2013 .
But it languished in the Republican - controlled House and Boehner repeatedly failed to convince conservatives in his caucus to embrace even piecemeal reform .
Earlier in the year , Obama pledged to take executive action to overcome intransigence on Capitol Hill .
He postponed the move until after the midterm elections under pressure from Senate Democrats who feared it would harm their chances of re - election .
The president is now under intense pressure from Latino groups not to break his promise a second time .
This week the Democratic representative Luis GutiÃ © rrez told the Guardian there would be a â€œcivil warâ€ � in the presidentâ€ ™ s party unless he takes executive action before Christmas .
Obama is expected to somehow expand the reach of his 2012 action , Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , which shielded young people brought to the country illegally as children from deportation and provided them with permits to work .
Extending the order to other categories of undocumented workers could enable millions of people in the country illegally to emerge from the shadows .
Analysts say the president is unlikely to move before the runoff election for Louisianaâ€ ™ s senate seat on 5 December , and that he may wait until Congress goes into recess about a week later .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s fair to say that Iâ€ ™ ve shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible , and Iâ€ ™ m going to keep on doing so , â€ � Obama said .
â€œBut in the meantime , letâ€ ™ s figure out what we can do lawfully through executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system.â€ �
White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Thursday reiterated the White Houseâ€ ™ s commitment to presidential action on immigration reform .
â€œYes , the president is going to take that action , â€ � he said .
But Boehner suggested that the vexed issue of immigration would result the first major collision between the parties after the midterms .
â€œThe president , if he continues to go down on this path of taking action on his own , is inviting big trouble , â€ �
he said .
Twice , he used the same â€œpoisoned - wellâ€ � metaphor adopted by McConnell 24 hours earlier .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve made clear to the president that if he acts unilaterally , on his own , outside of his authority , he will poison the well , and there will be no chance of immigration reform moving in this Congress , â€ � Boehner said .
Both Republican leaders will take that message to Obama at Fridayâ€ ™ s White House meeting , which will also be attended by the Democratic leaders who , in two months , will be in the minority in both chambers of Congress .
Despite evidence to the contrary , Boehner dismissed the suggestion he was â€œheld backâ€ � in pursuing immigration reform by his restive caucus .
Instead he laid the blame on exclusively on the brief spike in unaccompanied children arriving at the border over the summer , inflaming tensions .
â€œWhat held us back last year was a flood of kids coming to the border because of the actions that the president had already taken , â€ � he said .
â€œThe American people , from the right to the left , started looking at this issue in a very different way.â€ �"
2014-11-21,"House speaker John Boehner accused President Obama on Friday of â€œundermining the rule of lawâ€ � and â€œplacing lives at riskâ€ � with executive actions announced Thursday night to change how immigration laws are enforced .
Boehner spoke at a news conference Friday morning , little more than 12 hours after the president announced actions that would protect an estimated 5 million undocumented migrants in the United States from deportation and make many eligible for work permits .
â€œThe president has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms that he claims to seek , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œAnd as I told the president yesterday , heâ€ ™ s damaging the presidency itself.â€ � Republican leaders grew more assertive in their warnings to the president not to act on immigration after the partyâ€ ™ s victories in the midterm elections last month .
Both Boehner and Mitch McConnell , the incoming Senate majority leader , said unilateral action by the president on immigration would â€œpoison the wellâ€ � .
On Thursday the White House circulated an opinion by the Justice Departmentâ€ ™ s
Office of Legal Counsel finding that the new immigration rules did not exceed the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security to enforce immigration law .
Obama said Thursday that he was taking â€œthe same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before meâ€ � .
Republicans have said they would block funding for the new measures , but it was unclear how they could do so .
The Republican chairman of the House appropriations committee has raised questions about whether a spending bill really could be used to halt Obamaâ€ ™ s actions , noting that US Citizenship and Immigration Services is â€œentirely self - funded through the fees it collects on various immigration applicationsâ€ � and that Congress , as a result , can not actually â€œdefundâ€ � it .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re looking at the options that are available to us , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œI will say to you : the House will in fact act.â€ �
Boehner dismissed a questioner who asked whether the House Republicans were not also at fault because of their failure to take action on immigration reform .
The president was to blame , the speaker said .
â€œHe created an environment where the members would not trust him , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œAnd trying to find a way to work together was virtually impossible .
And I warned the president over and over that his actions were making it impossible for me to do what he wanted me to do.â€ �"
2014-11-21,"On Thursday , President Obama announced that he will use executive action â€ “ and push the limits of the law â€ “ to shield as many as 5 m undocumented immigrants from deportation .
The reaction from Republicans , even prior to his official announcement , was predictably measured : imminent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argued that Obama has waved a â€œred flag in front of a bullâ€ � ; Senator Ted Cruz invoked Cicero and called the president â€œan unaccountable monarch imposing his own policies in defiance of the American peopleâ€ � ; House Majority Leader John Boehner said Obama â€œsure acting like ... an emperorâ€ � .
Boehner actually invoked perhaps the emptiest threat in known human history on Thursday , asserting that if Obama acts , â€œThere will be no chance of immigration reform moving in this Congress.â€ �
I suspect that Obama can live with his actions and their success in reducing the likelihood that immigration reform will pass in the House from 0 % ... to 0 % .
It was inevitable that the Republican reaction would be overwrought ( â€œdictatorialâ€ � ! ) , inappropriate ( â€œsex traffickingâ€ � ! ) , pathetic ( â€œethnic cleansingâ€ � ! )
and/or downright stupid ( â€œanarchyâ€ � ! ) .
But do Obamaâ€ ™ s actions give the rest of us something to worry about ?
Hell , yes â€ “ Iâ€ ™ m not exactly looking forward to President Rand Paul unilaterally repealing the Civil Rights Act for the duration of his presidency .
Still , Obamaâ€ ™ s move on immigration may reflect some worrisome trends in the expansion of executive power â€ “ but that doesnâ€ ™ t mean heâ€ ™ s morally wrong to unilaterally act , nor constitutionally limited from doing so .
Is it the executive order legal ?
Probably , yes .
Separation - of - powers arguments do not involve mechanical precision , and itâ€ ™ s not impossible to argue that Obamaâ€ ™ s actions violate the Constitution .
But the arguments will be necessarily weak .
As Ben Wittes explained at the Lawfare blog , Congress gave the executive branch discretion over when to issue deportation orders and it didnâ€ ™ t require the attorney general to issue deportation orders for everyone who is theoretically eligible for deportation .
Obamaâ€ ™ s more systematic refusal to deport people eligible for deportation might violate the spirit of the law , but it doesnâ€ ™ t violate the letter .
Discretion in law enforcement is inherent to executive power , and in the case of immigration enforcement , Congress did not even try to eliminate it .
Claims that Obamaâ€ ™
s
refusal to deport people makes him a lawless tyrant are , to be charitable , overstated .
Does that make his executive order beyond reproach ?
Not necessarily : the letter of the law matters , but norms also matter , and there are plenty of procedural manoeuvres that can subvert basic democratic principles while being perfectly legal .
The frightening plan offered by some Republicans to rig the Electoral College is at war with basic principles of democracy , but itâ€ ™ s probably perfectly legal .
The Senate could , hypothetically , impose a de facto supermajority requirement on legislation , refuse to confirm any judicial or executive branch nominees , and vote to add 20 new seats to the US supreme court without exceeding its formal constitutional powers â€ “ but that wouldnâ€ ™ t be good for our government .
That wouldnâ€ ™ t be good for anybody .
American democracy canâ€ ™ t really work when everyone acts to the maximum extent of their legal power all the time â€ “ even if lawyers would all be making some solid overtime pay ,
thereâ€ ™ s
balance within checks and balances .
Obamaâ€ ™ s executive order is not as dangerous as trying to rig the Electoral College or summarily rejecting all supreme court nominees , but itâ€ ™ s far from an ideal way to address immigration reform .
If the Republican party was at all interested in actual governance , a mediocre immigration reform proposal passed by Congress would be preferable to an executive order , which can be undone with the stroke of a pen after the next election ( which will not have Barack Obama on the ballot ) .
But that also undermines claims
that Obamaâ€ ™ s executive order represents â€œtyrannyâ€ � .
Does using executive privilege to achieve immigration reform set a dangerous precedent ?
Well , long before Obama even ran for elected office â€ “ as Erwin Chemerinsky and Samuel Kleiner observed at the New Republic â€ “
Ronald Reagan â€œtook executive action to limit deportations for 200,000 Nicaraguan exilesâ€ � and the first President Bush did the same for some Chinese and Kuwaiti citizens .
At most , Obamaâ€ ™ s actions differ only in degree , not kind .
In a more general sense , presidents have been pushing the limits of their constitutional authority since the beginning of the republic .
If you had asked Thomas Jefferson in 1799 if the Louisiana Purchase was constitutional , he would almost certainly have said no â€ “
but we arenâ€ ™ t giving the land back .
( Admittedly , sometimes Iâ€ ™ m tempted to say that the US should look for the receipt and return some of those now - red states to France in exchange for a few dozen cases of ChÃ¢teauneuf - du - Pape . )
Itâ€ ™ s understandable for liberals to worry that just because Obama used his executive authority in this way , some future Republican president â€ “ like Rand Paul the Terrible , or Emperor Marco Rubio , or His Highness Ted Cruz â€ “ might push the limits of the law over the edge .
But itâ€ ™ s pretty unhelpful , too .
Both the second Bush administration and the actions of Republicans in Congress make it abundantly clear that the next Republican in the Oval Office is going to push toward â€ “ and probably beyond â€ “ the limits of his legal authority , no matter what Obama does .
( For instance , George W Bushâ€ ™ s warrantless wiretapping program , established by executive order , contradicted a statute outright , which Obamaâ€ ™ s order does not . )
If hypothetical president Rand Paul wants to refuse to enforce the Civil Rights Act , heâ€ ™ s not going to be dissuaded because Obama refused to act on immigration .
Obamaâ€ ™ s actions are legal , theyâ€ ™ re salutary on policy grounds , they have ample historical precedent , and they certainly donâ€ ™ t contravene actual existing norms of American politics .
Theyâ€ ™ re not the ideal way of addressing the immigration issue but , at this point , theyâ€ ™ re the best that can be done .
Republicans chose the game , and â€œKingâ€ � Obama isnâ€ ™ t doing anything wrong by throwing in his ante ."
2014-12-02,"And with that the hearing comes to a close and ends this morningâ€ ™ s immigration meetings in DC , a summary of which below .
Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson defended President Obamaâ€ ™ s executive orders granting relief to undocumented immigrants , saying it would bring people â€œout of the shadowsâ€ � .
Elsewhere in the House , Speaker John Boehner said â€œvarious optionsâ€ � remain on the table to counter the orders , such as limiting funding for DHS , and refused to say whether a government shutdown is a possibility .
The secretary pleaded for cooperation with Congress , saying DHS needs some $ 750 m for facilities , surveillance equipment and other needs .
He asked for Congress to act and insisted that DHS clearly differentiates between newly arrived immigrants and people residing in the US for years .
Members of Congress grilled Johnson on logistics , expressing special concern over the release of â€œcriminal aliensâ€ � and instances of fraud in the application process .
Johnson announced task forces to coordinate the eastern and western regions of the southern border , saying â€œwe are too stovepiped in our approach.â€ � Republicans like Michael McCaul and Patrick Meehan accused Obama and Johnson of having â€œbypassedâ€ � Congress and the American people , saying that the actions would spark a new wave of illegal immigration and that DHS has proven itself unable to handle border security .
Democrats backed Johnson , with Ron Barber of Arizona saying â€œwe have failed on our side of the bargainâ€ � , and also expressed concern about how families will be treated at detention centers .
Republican Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania is attacking Johnson for what he sees as gross overreach by the president .
Meehan argues that presidentsâ€ ™ executive action must be limited by how Congress â€œarticulates its intentâ€ � , and that Johnson is guilty of sophistry .
He cuts off just about every answer of the secretary , who tries to stress that eligible immigrants
â€œare already hereâ€ � and have been for several years .
The representative from Pennsylvania turns red with anger : â€œUnder congressional intent they are not lawfully here , and the president has created a category out of whole cloth.â€ �
Elsewhere in the House , Speaker John Boehner has emerged from a meeting with Republican leaders with a few concrete proposals for immigration action .
My colleague Dan Roberts reports from Washington : â€œWe have limited options for dealing with it directly , â€ � he told reporters .
â€œVarious optionsâ€ � remain on the table , insisted Boehner , a formulation thought to include passing a token bill registering House disapproval .
Boehner is believed to have told rank and file members of the House GOP caucus that defunding the government in retaliation is not a realistic option .
Instead , Republicans are planning to pass legislation that would continue to fund most government activities for another year , but may grant limited funding for the Department for Homeland Security â€ “ which manages immigration â€ “ until early next year only .
But Boehner also refused to answer questions about whether a government shutdown was now â€œoff the tableâ€ � , leaving open the outside possibility of more aggressive responses for the time being .
King attacks the president by way of a proxy , Johnson : â€œIf the president felt there was a consensus among the American people , the this shouldâ€ ™ ve been part in the campaign debate .
The campaign is over , Republicans win both houses , then the president takes this action .
He says Obama acted â€œin bad faithâ€ � with Congress and the American people : â€œWhy didnâ€ ™ t the president set a deadline , six months â€ ¦ force Republicans to deal with him?â€ �
Johnson says â€œwe did do that , we did exactly that .
We said we would do this in the spring and see over the summer whether Congress decided to act .
â€
¦ Weâ€ ™ ve done a lot of waiting , weâ€ ™ ve waited for several years.â€ �
King : â€œIf he felt that strongly about it he shouldâ€ ™ ve acted before the election.â€ �
Peter King , a voluble Republican from New York , starts off by praising Johnsonâ€ ™ s professionalism .
Johnson grins , â€œIt goes all downhill from here , huh?â€ �
Mark Sanford of South Carolina asks about people trying to immigrate through legal channels .
â€œI think one of the things that a lot of people struggle with on the notion of the presidentâ€ ™ s executive and unilateral action is that it will put a lot of people on a second class bus .
Is it fair for the people whoâ€ ™ ve been waiting in line?â€ �
Johnson :
â€œThrough executive action we can not grant citizenship , we can not put people in the head of the line.â€ �
Sanford : â€œBut itâ€ ™ s de facto citizenship in that they can live here , work here , raise families
here.â€ �
Johnson starts to lose some patience : â€œIn fact
they already are.â€
�
Sanford : â€œThey are , but they now have legal claim to our entitlement system .
â€
¦
How do you say to that struggling family in Mississippi â€ ¦
What do you say to that family that your retirement system , your healthcare system is less financially solvent?â€
�
Johnson :
â€œThe people weâ€ ™ re talking about are already here , theyâ€ ™ ve been here for years , theyâ€ ™ re integrated members of society.â€ � Curtis Clawson of Florida says heâ€ ™ s not going to â€œharangueâ€
� Johnson , and asks about taxpayersâ€ ™
â€œbang for the buckâ€ � .
â€œWhen we ask for operational data , to know what the bang for the buck is for the tax member .
If I was a board member and you and I were back in our previous lives , I would say â€ ¦ when I donâ€
™ t know what the return on investment is â€ ¦ other than really macro data
â€ “
can you shed any light on that?â€ �
Johnson : â€œI will say that I remain committed to more transparency.â€ �
The secretary says he wants to work with Congress to â€œdevelop metricsâ€ � to evaluate just how well border security is working .
Johnson : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a misapprehension that things are as worse as theyâ€ ™ ve ever bed .
In fact , apprehension of illegal immigrants are as low as theyâ€ ™ ve ever been .
In large part because of the investment made by this Congress â€ ¦
but we have seen a return on investment.â€
�
Barletta :
â€œSo adding more than five million workers will make it easier?â€ � Johnson : â€œThe potential class is up to four million , not all will apply .
And this will allow [ migrants ] to get on the books , to pay taxes , and the assessment is that will not impinge American jobs.â€ � Barletta :
â€œYou donâ€ ™ t think an employer will think , â€˜do
I keep an American worker and provide health insurance or pay a $ 3,000 fine , or do I get rid of the American and hire an undocumented worker?â€ ™ â€ � Johnson : â€œI donâ€ ™ t
think I see it that way.â€ � Lou Barletta , Republican of Pennsylvania , asks how an influx of documented workers will affect American jobs .
Johnson : â€œCongressman
, the fact is , as Iâ€ ™ m sure you know , that we have lots of undocumented in this country working off the books .
And if thatâ€ ™ s not apparent I suggest you spend some time in a restaurant in the Washington DC area and see for yourself.â€ �
Barletta : â€œHow does that make it easier for the American worker ?
Here we go again talking about the illegal immigrant !
Why donâ€ ™ t we talk about the American worker and what this will do to them , and not what this will do for the illegal immigrant!â€ � Johnson :
â€œWell the economy is getting better , and the question of US jobs is a separate issue.â€ �
Johnson uses a small window window to plead for Congress to give him a chance : â€œI have in my private law practice negotiated the most complex civil settlement on Wall Street .
I believe if we could strip away the emotion and the politics on this issue , and you brought me the right members â€
¦ I could negotiate a settlement .
It should not be that difficult.â€ �
Chaffetz starts talking about four detainees who have ties to the Kurdish Workers Party , which the representative says is designated by the State Department as a terrorist organization .
Chaffetz tries to use them as a case study for DHS and Obama administration mismanagement .
Johnson makes clear that â€œThey were released by a judge .
That was not my decision .
â€
¦
They are in deportation proceedings , an immigration judge released two of the four and they fled to Canada .
My intent is that they be deported , but two are in Canada seeking asylumâ€ �
Chaffetz uses the spotlight to say that when Democrats controlled Congress they did nothing to pass immigration reform : â€œThey brought Stephen Colbert on to testify , thatâ€ ™ s how bad it
was!â€
�
Remarks finally over , chairman McCaul reminds the committee that the secretaryâ€ ™ s time is limited .
Representative Jason Chaffetz , Republican from Utah , is harping on the presidentâ€ ™ s legal authority .
He plays a short audio clip of Obama saying he â€œchanged the lawâ€ � Johnson simply says again that the administration acted â€œwithin the lawâ€ � .
As for the clip of Obama : â€œIâ€ ™ ve been a lawyer for 30 years , somebody plays me an 8-word excerpt and Iâ€ ™ m gon na be suspicious.â€ � Representative Beto Oâ€ ™ Rourke , Democrat from Texasâ€ ™ 16th district , says heâ€ ™ s â€œconcerned about statements the presidentâ€ ™ s made â€ ¦ about stepping up border security.â€ � Oâ€ ™ Rourke says heâ€ ™ s spent some time at the Arteja family detention center that has become â€œa deportation
machineâ€ � and that he wants to make sure â€œin our effort to satisfy security concerns we donâ€ ™ t
shorten due processâ€ � .
â€œWe talk about stepping up border enforcement â€ ¦
Iâ€ ™ d like to know what that means for my community , is that simply repositioning forces , moving border patrol up to the line of the border , or are you asking for more agents , more walls , more of these militarization measures , which I think shows us a problem of diminishing returns right now .
At what point do we have enough security on the border?â€ �
Johnson says the Arteja center is being closed â€œin lieu of the larger Dilly centerâ€ � .
( He earlier highlighted Dilly as an apparently more humane and better equipped detention center for families and young children . )
On border security , â€œit is correct that apprehensions are way down from 15 years ago and resoruces are way up , but we can do way better .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to sit here and declare that we have a secure border
â€ ¦ Weâ€ ™ ve made great strides but there is more to do.â€ � â€œOur southern border campaign plan is not simply repositioning assets .
Itâ€ ™ s a more strategic â€ ¦ approach â€ ¦ in a more coordinated way , region by region , so there is one person in the south - west who is responsible for bringing to bear the resources of border security in Arizona , New Mexico and Texas.â€ �
Jeff Duncan of South Carolina , a Republican who says itâ€ ™ s
â€œno surpriseâ€ � that he opposes the president , asks Johnson â€œwhy
arenâ€ ™ t
we patriating these peopleâ€ � whoâ€ ™ ve entered the US illegally in 2014 .
Johnson : â€œThatâ€ ™ s something that requires a willing partner on the other end , and Iâ€ ™ ve had conversations with the State Department about [ working with other countries].â€
�
Duncan
: â€œAt the end of the year 2014 how many illegal criminal aliens will be released?â€ �
Johnson says it will likely be around 30,000 people , trying hard to stress that the number is less than 2013â€ ™
s estimated 36,000 people , and that heâ€ ™ s working to lower the numbers .
Duncan goes further with his questions about illegal migrants with a criminal record , especially on visa overstays : â€œWeâ€ ™ re not chasing a footprint in the desert .
We know who they are , they came here on a visa , thatâ€ ™ s low hanging fruit for enforcement .
How many visa overstays are granted [ protection ] on the presidentâ€ ™ s action?â€
�
Johnson : â€œOff - hand
I donâ€
™ t know â€
¦ Congressman , I will say I want to see Congress pass a billâ€ ¦
â€ �
Duncan
: â€œI think Congress can pass a bill , but the American people have to regain trust with this administration!â€ �
He slaps the stand : â€œI cede my time!â€ � Representative Ron Barber , Democrat from Arizona , says that Congress has failed to do itâ€ ™ s duty on immigration : â€œI believe it should be done in concert with Congress but we have failed on our side of the bargain.â€
�
Johnson says the executive action primarily helps those â€œwhoâ€ ™ ve not committed any crimes and whoâ€ ™ ve [ integrated with the community].â€ � â€œThis is the opportunity to be accountable .
That is not citizenship and that is not [ a pathway to citizenship ] .
You are deemed lawfully present in the country for a period of time.â€ � Representative Candice Miller , Republican from Michigan , asks about how DHS plans to do a case - by - case review of some four million undocumented immigrants estimated eligible for relief .
Johnson :
â€œWell we have an implementation period of more than six months .
â€

We determined we needed six months to get it right .
From the Daca experience we know that [ with the right application ] fee it will pay for itself.â€
� â€œWith regard to the number four million , 4.1 million is the estimated potential class of those who will be eligible .

Keating asks what does DHS believe it needs on the ground , and what itâ€ ™ s learned from border law enforcement .
Johnson :
â€œThey almost always tell me more vehicles , more surveillance , more technology.â€ � â€œWeâ€ ™ re moving in the direction of a risk based strategy in homeland security ,
border security â€ ¦ because we have high technology to surveil â€ ¦ that includes aerial surveillance and mobile surveillance on the ground .
Weâ€ ™ ve shown considerable investments in the past 15 years but
Iâ€ ™ m convinced we can [ do more].â€ � Keating : â€œCan you be clear about your fiscal resources â€
¦ are you capable of sending everyone back ?
If weâ€ ™ re really serious about this how much does your agency need to do what the members of this committee are asking you to do?â€

Johnson makes another push for a vote on the budget heâ€

Democrat Bill Keating asks whether this is amnesty or â€œfunctionally
amnestyâ€

Johnson gives an emphatic â€œNoâ€ � .
Keating asks whether Johnson considers this in any way â€œa permanent solutionâ€ � .
Johnson : â€œNo .

[ But Iâ€ ™ ll repeat ] since Iâ€ ™ ve been in office weâ€ ™ ve not had a willing partner in the House of Representatives
but I continue to want to work with this committee , members of the House , members of Congress .

We were forced to do this.â€
� Representative Mike Rogers , Republican of Alabama , takes an uncompromising line against Johnson â€ “ and immigration at large .
â€œI disagree with you .
The statute is very clear that these illegals in this country are to be removed once theyâ€ ™ re located.â€ � Rogers : â€œHow do you get them to prove â€ ¦ that theyâ€ ™ ve been living here for the past seven years?â€ �
Rogers puts forward a scenario in which an applicant presents electricity bills for years , under someone elseâ€ ™ s name who the applicant says they rented from â€
“ reducing the whole problem to a question of trust and secondary sources .
Johnson :
â€œGood question .
The onus will be on the applicant to provide evidence that theyâ€ ™ ve been in this country for the five year period .
â€
¦
I do not believe it will be as simple as â€˜take my word for it.â€
™ â€ �
He says CIS will have to decide what exactly applicants must provide to prove their residency .
Rogers isnâ€ ™ t having it : â€œThis is an area that will be wrought with fraud .
I think it will be impossible for you to determine who qualifies under this very broad and illegal executive order.â€ � Sheila Jackson , Democrat from Texas , wants to get a few statements on the record : â€œDoes not confer immigration status or a pathway to citizenship , is that
correct?â€ �
Johnson : â€œYesâ€
� Jackson talks a bit about the precedents made by other presidents , saying she believes President Reagan , for instance , â€œsaw a humanitarian crisis and decided to actâ€ � .
She also asks about the new detention center in Dilly , Texas , and what exactly will change in the Daca relief program .
â€œThe current Daca program is for those whoâ€ ™ ve been here since June 2007 , which is almost , over seven years .
You have to have been here over seven years , come here at age
16 â€
¦
We removed the birthday limitation , and weâ€ ™ ve [ changed ] the eligibility preiods from three years to two years.â€ �
He says he sent his own team to make sure the new Dilly detention center can support families .
Smith accuses Johnson of â€œreleasing criminal aliens
and you are releasing people who should be sent home.â€ � â€œDo
you want to estimate how many people are being released who are criminal aliens?â€ �
Johnson tries to describe how ICE ( Immigration and Customs Enforcement ) is working to pursue criminals whoâ€ ™ ve crossed the border .
Smith : â€œThatâ€ ™ s nice but thatâ€ ™ s not answering my question.â€
�
Representative Lamar Smith , Republican of Texas , goes after Johnson for a number of the people whoâ€ ™ ve entered the US illegally in 2014 .
He disregards much of Johnsonâ€ ™ s response about â€œmetricsâ€ � , though he gets the secretary to admit that he too wants to see the figure come down dramatically .
Smith : â€œI
donâ€ ™ t we have the metrics we need to determine whether the border is secure or not.â€ �
Thompson moves on to asking how DHS will actually make the border more secure , and Johnson mildlycriticizes US policy a little : â€œWe are in my opinion too stovepiped in our approach.â€ � â€œWe need to bring a more comprehensive , strategic approach .
So what weâ€ ™ re doing is creating two regional task forces : joint task force west , joint task force east .
I expect to announce the leaders of those two task forces soon.â€ � Thompson : â€œIf Congress does not give you the money , can you continue to maintain the level of support to address that issue if Congress continues to refuse to give you the money necessary to do that
job?â€ �
Johnson :
â€œIt will be very difficult .
We have as part of our â€ ¦ budget request a request for an additional 750 m dollars .
Most of that will go to detention and resources , and we want to maintain that and add to it.â€ � â€œWe need to pay for these things , and i know that every member of this committee wants to enhance border security , and hope that Congress will [ hear ] my request.â€ �
McCaul cedes the microphone to Bennie Thompson , Democrat from Mississippi .
He also asks about Obamaâ€ ™ s legal authority .
Johnson starts off a little wry , saying that while developing these actions he would ask himself : â€œCould I defend that action before a committee of Congress if Iâ€ ™ m called to do so?â€
� â€œI am fully confident that we have the legal authority â€ ¦ specifically with deferred actions , which presidents have performed for decades .
So I am fully comfortable the deferred actions are a legal authority acceptable to use from time to time , and we have done so.â€
�
McCaul now moves on to say that a new â€œsurge in illegal immigrationâ€ � is on its way , encouraged by the perception of amnesty .
â€œItâ€ ™ s coming .
In my opinion thereâ€ ™ s no question about it.â€
�
He then says that false applications and fraud threaten the immigration systems in place and enacted by the president :
â€œWhat are you going to do [ to prevent people ] from people fraudulently entering the country?â€ �
Johnson : â€œI too am concerned about that .
Fraudulent applications â€ ¦ are a priority of mine.â€ �
McCaul says he thinks itâ€ ™ s a political decision rather than a policy decision , and presses Johnson about the timing of the presidentâ€ ™ s statements and actions on immigrations .
Johnson responds by saying that while he and DHS have been working on these actions for months , talking with lawyers and members of Congress , the administration has repeatedly been asked to delay any action .
He says that one election , then another , then another kept pushing back any action .
McCaul asks what legal authority the president has , saying that Obama has said â€œmore than 20 times that he does not have the legal authorityâ€ � to make unilateral immigration reform .
Johnson dodges :
â€œI know from 30 years as a lawyer that when someone paraphrases remarks that I want to see the full Q&amp;A.â€ �
The secretary says thereâ€ ™ s legal backing for the president : â€œWhat I know is weâ€ ™ ve spent months developing these reforms â€ ¦ in very close consultation with lawyers .
There are things they told us that we did not have the legal authority to do â€ ¦ and there are things they told us , very clearly , that there are things we do have the legal authority.â€ �
Secretary Johnson gives his opening statement : â€œLet me begin by saying in the same vein in the chairmanâ€ ™ s remarks , we wonâ€ ™ t always agree , we have not always agreed , but I do appreciate the friendship and collegiality that we enjoy between members of this committee and me and my staff.â€ � â€œOn November 20 the president announced a series of executive actions to begin to fix our immigration action .
The president views these actions as the first step to reform , and continues to count on Congress.â€ �
He outlines the actions , tailoring the highlights to the largely Republican committee : â€œto promote border security for the future and to send a strong message that our borders are not open to illegal immigration â€ ¦ those that came here illegally after January 1 2014 , regardless of where they were apprehended , [ will not be exempt from deportation].â€ �
He alludes to prosecutorial discretion , noting the policy to prioritize the removal of â€œthose convicted of crimes , members of gangs and national security threatsâ€ � .
He says that the actions help those people whoâ€ ™ ve been here for five years and without a criminal record to â€œcome out of the shadows â€ ¦ pay taxes and help our economyâ€ � .
â€œThis is simple common sense .
â€ ¦ President Obama continues to count on Congress for â€
¦ comprehensive reform.â€
�
Thompson says heâ€ ™ s looking forward to hearing more about what Johnson and DHS will do to prevent the spread of misinformation to people in Central America who may want to attempt the crossing into the US .
He also pushes for Congress to act on farm workers without immigration papers , saying that although they were omitted by the presidentâ€ ™ s actions they are too important to ignore .
Representative Bennie Thompson , of Mississippi , is now speaking , rounding up the Democratsâ€ ™ view of Obamaâ€ ™ s immigration actions .
â€œTime and again the Republican partyâ€ ™ s
leadership has been unwilling to fix our immigration [ system ] .
â€ ¦
The president acted in a measured way that is likely to enhance both our security and our economy.â€ � Heâ€ ™ s summarizing some of the effects of the executive action , including how immigrants without a criminal record can apply for a legal work permit , and how the age limit has been removed from the Daca program .
( You can read about the actions more here . )
McCaul continues to fire opening volleys : â€œAmnesty perpetuates a cycle of illegal entry into our country.â€ �
â€œThis was true in the 1980s and this is true of this administrationâ€ ™ s abuse of prosecutorial discretion , the power when to prosecute and when not to .
Theyâ€ ™ ve taken a sweeping approach to prosecutorial discretion that makes a mockery of the law.â€ �
He says we can expect many more thousands of children to come to the US even just because of â€œthe perception of amnesty â€
¦ we essentially tell citizens of other countries , â€˜if you come here
you can stay ,
donâ€ ™ t worry , we wonâ€ ™ t deport you.â€ ™ â€ � â€œWe will see a wave of illegal immigration because of the presidentâ€ ™ s actions.â€
�
He says itâ€ ™ s a â€œreckless disregard of Americaâ€ ™ s securityâ€ � and that the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) is â€œwoefully unpreparedâ€ � to handle another wave of immigrants .
McCaul begins , saying â€œweâ€ ™ re here to discuss the grave consequences of the administrationâ€ ™ s recent actions to bypass Congress.â€ �
He says immigration is â€œan emotional and divisive issue , thereâ€ ™ s no doubt about that .
Let me be clear , our immnigration system is clear and we need to fix it.â€
�
â€œAmerica has always stood clear as a beacon of hope for millions who are seeking a better or life .
But regardless of where you stand on this issue thereâ€ ™ s a right way to do this and a wrong way .
Unfortunately the president has chosen to do this the wrong way.â€ � â€œThe president risks breaking something much for fundamental , our democratic process .
The people , not just one man , should be our ultimate decision makers in our countryâ€ ™ s political actions.â€ �
Johnson has arrived just a few minutes late , facing off with McCaul and the committee , and the hearing is ready to begin .
Todayâ€ ™ s primary point of contention will be
Obamaâ€ ™ s executive action on immigration â€ “ summarized conveniently here by my colleague Nicky Woolf :
Expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ( Daca ) , a 2012 program which has provided relief from deportation to around 580,000 people brought into the US as children by removing the age cap on eligibility , currently set at 31 .
Relief will also be extended to those who came to the US illegally , but are the parents of US citizens and green - card holders .
Strengthen border patrols , with three new cross - agency task forces â€ ” southern maritime , southern land border and investigative .
Revise its priorities to focus more on threats to national security , including gang members and convicted felons .
Illegal immigrants who are convicted of â€œsignificant or multiple misdemeanorsâ€ � will be second - tier priorities , and those who have disobeyed an order of removal after January 1 , 2014 will be third - tier .
End the controversial â€œsecure communitiesâ€ � program , which partnered with state and local law enforcement as well as a database of biometrics to find illegal immigrants to deport .
Reforming the â€œOptional Professional Trainingâ€ � period for foreign students .
Students can now apply for 12 additional monthsâ€ ™ visa , or 29 months in science and technology field .
The executive announcement does not extend the program , but mandates that it be â€œevaluated , strengthened , and improved , â€ � and expand the number of degree programs eligible .

Republicans on the committee will try to grill Secretary Johnson on what they say is a woefully deficient policy for a porous border â€ “ even though Johnson has overseen record deportations under the Obama administration in the past few years .
The committeeâ€ ™ s
chair , Texasâ€ ™ Mike McCaul , released in October a â€œblueprintâ€ � for border security along the Mexican border , laying out over 41 pages precisely what he thinks more than 10 border regions need to be made inviolable .
He advocates surveillance of the region akin to that used in Afghanistan and Iraq and strict penalties for anyone who crosses it illegally .
Johnson , the hearingâ€ ™ s sole witness , has been the Homeland Security secretary since 2013 , and responded to last summerâ€ ™ s wave of some 70,000 child migrants by saying he had a clear message for families coming north : â€œYou will be sent home.â€
�
The department has been criticized for its detention centers and enforcement methods .
Johnson also recently withdrew his name from consideration to replace secretary of defense Chuck Hagel .
Good morning and welcome to our liveblog coverage of the US homeland security
secretaryâ€ ™ s testimony to the House of Representatives .
This is Jeh Johnsonâ€ ™ s first congressional appearance since Barack Obama announced sweeping and controversial executive action on immigration , which Republican members of Congress have vowed to undo .
The executive action granted protection from deportation for some undocumented migrants whose children are legal US citizens , and also allowed legal work permits for several million migrants .
The hearing , officially called Open Borders :
The Impact of Presidential Amnesty on Border Security , is being chaired by Mike McCaul , a Texas Republican and a staunch opponent of Obamaâ€ ™ s policy ."
2014-12-11,"A rebellion against Wall Street efforts to wriggle free from recent banking reforms picked up momentum in Congress on Thursday as House Democrats dramatically withdrew support for passage of the US budget in a knife - edge procedural vote .
Republican speaker John Boehner was forced to turn to departing freshman congressman Kerry Bentivolio , a reindeer farmer from Michigan who is reported to be heavily in debt after losing his primary race , to keep the $ 1.1tn US budget on track by switching his vote at the last minute .
Sixteen other conservative Republicans voted against the procedural measure needed to hold a final debate and vote on the 1,600-page budget omnibus bill , and it was only Bentivolioâ€ ™ s last - minute switch from no to yes that allowed the â€˜ruleâ€ ™ procedure to pass by 214 - 212 votes .
The Republican rebels are angry at their leadershipâ€ ™ s reticence to take more immediate steps against President Obamaâ€ ™ s immigration reform by using the budget as threat to shut down the government .
But it was the surprise decision of all House Democrats to oppose the carefully crafted compromise bill that put it in sudden jeopardy .
According to senior aides speaking last week , Boehner had been expecting that support from many House Democrats would more than make up for any rebellion on the right on his party .
Yet Democrats are furious at what they see as an attempt by Wall Street lobbyists to insert language into the bill that would reverse parts of the Dodd - Frank banking reform and allow more risky derivative trading to receive government insurance protection .
The White House , while insisting Obama does not like the Wall Street component , later confirmed it supported passage of the bill as a whole .
Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said on Thursday its passage would â€œprovide certainty to our economyâ€ � .
Shortly after , Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor that she should not vote for the billâ€ ™ s final passage .
â€œIâ€ ™ m enormously disappointed the White House feels the only way they could get a bill is to go along with this , â€ �
she said .
Another controversial rider to increase tenfold the amount that political donors can give to parties and candidates has also raised anger among liberals who regard the two buried clauses as classic cases of Washington dysfunction .
Whether there is enough anger to prevent passage of the bill entirely is less certain , however .
Many Democrats may be unwilling to be blamed for shutting down the government , and Republican whips are working furiously to try to contain the size of their rebellion when the final vote comes up later on Thursday .
The risk of a repeat of last yearâ€ ™ s government shutdown is also limited due to the fallback ability of House leaders to pass a short - term continuing resolution that would fund the government until Congress returns with a larger Republican majority in the new year .
Yet such a move also carries risks for Democrats and the White House , which fears it would embolden Republicans to use the budget process to attack new policy targets , such as environmental and social programs .
Nevertheless , the Wall Street clause , which would overturn elements of Dodd - Frank and grant government insurance to parts of the derivatives market , is sufficient provocation for many on the partyâ€ ™ s left to draw a line at the current compromise .
Republican deputy whip Tom Cole , who spoke in favour of the bill during debate on Thursday morning , refuted the idea that two contentious elements were only inserted due to Republican pressure .
â€œThe idea that only Republicans were involved in drafting this is just not the case , â€ � he said .
â€œThe reality is the Democratic Senate and the administration have been involved in this at every level.â€ � Louise Slaughter , ranking Democrat on the House rules committee , argued the â€œbehemothâ€ � of a bill was â€œsubmitted in the dark of night at the last minute in the hope that we would not find out what was in it.â€ �
â€œThe House of Representatives is about to show us the worst of government for the rich and powerful , â€ � said Senator Elizabeth Warren in a speech on Wednesday that served to rally opposition .
â€œThe House is about to vote on a budget deal , negotiated behind closed doors , that slips in a deal that would let derivative traders working on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system.â€ �
Warren claims the clause was written by lobbyists for Citigroup and epitomises what is wrong with Washingtonâ€ ™ s legislative process .
â€œWho does Congress work for?â€ � she added .
â€œDoes it work for the billionaires and the giant companies with their armies of lobbyists and lawyers , or does it work for the ordinary people?â€ �"
2014-12-11,"A last - ditch revolt against Wall Street efforts to overturn key banking reforms is threatening to derail passage of the $ 1.1 trillion US budget through Congress on Thursday just hours before funding for the federal government is due to expire .
Democrats in the House of Representatives have rallied around Senator Elizabeth Warren to oppose the plan , hatched with support from corporate lobbyists , which buries the clause deep in the 1,600-page omnibus spending bill and could extend future public bailouts to riskier trading activities .
Because the budget bill is also opposed by some on the right of the Republican party for delaying a fight with the Obama administration over immigration reform , the House speaker , John Boehner , may need some Democratic votes to secure passage of the omnibus bill before government funding authorisation expires at midnight on Thursday .
But the minority leader , Nancy Pelosi , has yet to say whether she will lend her support amid mounting disquiet on the left of the Democratic caucus over the Wall Street clause and other so - called â€œridersâ€ � , including further relaxation of campaign finance limits .
In a fast - moving effort to shore up the fragile budget agreement on Thursday morning , Republicans were hopeful they might not need more than a handful of Democratic votes if they can limit the size of their own rebellion .
The fight is likely to come to a head on Thursday afternoon with a procedural vote needed before the main budget bill , which also needs to pass the Senate , can proceed .
The risk of a repeat of last yearâ€ ™ s government shutdown is limited due to the fall - back ability of House leaders to pass a short - term continuing resolution that would fund the government until Congress returns with a larger Republican majority in the new year .
Yet this also carries risks for Democrats and the White House , which fears it would embolden Republicans to use the budget process to attack new policy targets such as environmental and social programmes .
Nevertheless the Wall Street clause , which would overturn elements of the Dodd - Frank banking reform and grant government insurance to parts of the derivatives market , is sufficient provocation for many on the left of the party to draw a line at the current compromise .

2014-12-12,"New legislation that would have opened the US government to greater public accountability by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act has died in Congress after the Republican speaker of the House John Boehner refused to schedule a vote .
Democratic senator Patrick Leahy , who spearheaded the push in Congress to pass the Foia Improvement Act of 2014 , led the chorus of indignation following the collapse of the bill .
In a statement , Leahy said that the Republican leadership had â€œchosen secrecy over sunlight â€ ¦ In a political climate as divided as this , I had hoped that we could come together in favor of something as fundamental to our democracy as the publicâ€ ™ s right to know.â€ �
Amy Bennett of OpenTheGovernment.org , the coalition of groups that led the charge for the reforms , said that Boehner carried responsibility for the failure to pass a bill that had until this week enjoyed bipartisan support .
â€œHe should be called to account for having killed a bill that would have held the US government accountable.â€ � Ryan Shapiro , an expert on freedom of information at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , described his reaction to the collapse of the bill as â€œdisappointed and angry .
We had the votes.â€ �
He added : â€œThis is a flat - out oligarchic perversion of democracy , and Speaker Boehner should hang his head in shame.â€ � Boehnerâ€ ™ s decision not to hold a vote on the reform legislation was all the more surprising given the universal agreement from both main parties and in both chambers of Congress that improved access to government records was a good thing .
The bill would have made permanent the principle that public information should be presumed open unless it specifically needs to be kept secret under clearly defined exemptions .
As Thursday night proceeded with no vote being called by the Republican leadership , several people involved in the procedural wrangling reported that lobbyists believed to be representing the banking industry were actively pushing for the bill to be sidelined .
The lobbyists argued that provisions in the improvement bill would have exposed banks and financial houses to the public disclosure by federal regulators of sensitive commercial information â€ “ a contention fiercely disputed by freedom of information advocates .
Advocates for the legislation will now recharge their batteries before attempting to reintroduce the bill in the New Year .
The prospect of the reforms being enacted may suffer , however , as a result of the incoming Republican majority in both chambers of Congress and the fact that Leahy , the prime champion of open government on Capitol Hill , is losing his chairmanship of the Senate judiciary committee amid the Republican takeover .
Bennett lamented the missed opportunity to strike a blow for accountability .
â€œThe bill would have forced the federal government to finally deliver on the promise of openness that President Obama made on his first day ,
â€ � she said ."
2014-12-30,"The House Republicansâ€ ™ embattled majority whip , Steve Scalise , said Tuesday that he regrets his â€œmistakeâ€ � in attending a white supremacist conference , as new questions emerged about his insistence that he was unaware of the groupâ€ ™ s extreme views .
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called on Tuesday for Scaliseâ€ ™ s fellow Republican , House speaker John Boehner , to publicly condemn Scaliseâ€ ™ s appearance at a 2002 conference held by a group organised by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke .
â€œSteve Scalise chose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo - Nazis at a white supremacist rally and now his fellow House Republican Leaders canâ€ ™ t even speak up and say he was wrong , â€ �
DCCC National Press Secretary Josh Schwerin said in a statement .
â€œWhile David Duke defends Scalise , Speaker Boehner and Leader McCarthy are refusing to condemn Scaliseâ€ ™ s choice of allies .
Republicans in Congress might talk about improving their terrible standing with non - white voters , but itâ€ ™ s clear their leadership has a history of embracing anti - Semitic , racist hate groups.â€
�
Boehner later rejected calls for Scalise to be removed from the House Republican leadership , saying in a statement , â€œMore than a decade ago , Representative Scalise made an error in judgment , and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate .
Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle , I know Steve to be a man of high integrity and good character .
He has my full confidence as our Whip.â€ �
In a statement of his own released Tuesday afternoon , Scalise said : â€œTwelve years ago , I spoke to many different Louisiana groups as a state representative , trying to build support for legislation that focused on cutting wasteful state spending , eliminating government corruption , and stopping tax hikes .
One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn.â€ � â€œIt was a mistake I regret , and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views that groups like these hold .
I am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain , â€ �
Scalise added .
â€œAs
a Catholic , these groups hold views that are vehemently opposed to my own personal faith , and I reject that kind of hateful bigotry .
Those who know me best know I have always been passionate about helping , serving , and fighting for every family that I represent .
And I will continue to do so.â€ �
But the story of Scaliseâ€ ™ s speech , first revealed by Louisiana blogger Lamar White , is attracting growing criticism from commentators on the right .
â€œHow the hell
does somebody show up at a David Duke organized event in 2002 and claim ignorance?â€ � demanded Erick Erickson , an influential conservative blogger .
â€œBy 2002
, everybody knew Duke was still the man he had claimed not to be .
EVERYBODY.â€ � â€œRep Scalise should resign his leadership post .
The party of Lincoln shouldnâ€ ™ t have as its number three a keynoter at a white supremacist convention ,
â€ � added Peter Wehner , a former deputy assistant to President George W Bush .
Several senior Republican figures , including Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal , initially spoke out on Scaliseâ€ ™ s behalf , but the congressmanâ€ ™ s argument that he was unaware that the group to which he spoke â€ “
the European - American Unity and Rights Organisation â€ “ had links to Duke is under growing pressure .
In an interview with the Washington Post , Duke said that not only did Scalise willingly accept the invitation to speak but that he was in close contact with Dukeâ€ ™ s top aides .
â€œScalise would communicate a lot with my campaign manager , Kenny Knight , â€ �
Duke told the Post .
â€œThat is why he was invited and why he would come .
Kenny knew Scalise , Scalise knew Kenny .
They were friendly.â€ �
Federal election records also show that Knight was a donor to Scaliseâ€ ™ s 2008 congressional campaign .
Knight later confirmed his close relationship with Scalise , but insists the congressman saw him as a local civic leader rather than a political ally of Duke .
â€œThis all came about because I organised the EURO meeting for David Duke as a courtesy after he had moved to Russia , â€ � Knight told the Post in a separate interview .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve known David for 40 years so
I did him a favour .
As part of that , I decided to ask Steve , our local representative , to come by and say a few words before the conference started .
He agreed , believing it was going to be neighbours , friends and family .
He saw me not as David Dukeâ€ ™ s guy , but as the president of our civic association.â€ � Knight also acknowledged the audience included â€œpeople who are concerned about the survival of their race , â€ � but said he didnâ€ ™ t think Scalise knew anything about the EURO group itself .
â€œWe wouldnâ€ ™ t talk about race or the Jewish question , â€ � Knight told the Post .
â€œSteve knew who I was , but I donâ€
™ t think he held it against me , â€ � he added .
Knight also said he believes Scalise did not hear Duke give a speech by video .
Scalise , who was a Louisiana state representative at the time of the May 2002 conference , was quoted in a 1999 interview with Roll Call making it clear he was well aware of Dukeâ€ ™ s toxic reputation but was mainly concerned this made him difficult to elect .
â€œThe voters in this district are smart enough to realize that they need to get behind someone who not only believes in the issues they care about , but also can get elected .
Duke has proven that he canâ€ ™ t get elected , and thatâ€ ™ s the first and most important thing , â€ �
Scalise told Roll Call .
Scalise has responded to the allegations by acknowledging he was almost certainly at the conference but insisting it had no bearing on his political judgement or abhorrence of racism , and blamed a lack of staff for his failure to check it out in advance .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t know who all of these groups were and I detest any kind of hate group .
For anyone to suggest that I was involved with a group like that is insulting and ludicrous , â€ � he told his local paper , the Times - Picayune , in an interview on Monday night .
Some supporters in Congress argue Scalise is victim of a politically - motivated campaign .
â€œI do not think this story in and of itself will hurt Steve .
One would have to see a pattern .
I have never seen such a pattern in Steveâ€ ™ s politics , the policies he supports or his personal behavior , â€ � said deputy whip Tom Cole .
â€œRepublicans in the House know Steve Scalise
well .
We are proud of him and his leadership and we believe any suggestion that is racist is politically motivated claptrap .
In my opinion his position as a leader in our Conference is secure.â€ �"
2015-01-05,"A Texas Republican known for outsider views has announced he is challenging Speaker John Boehner for the top job in the US House of Representatives .
Representative Louie Gohmert , a Tea Party favorite , said on Fox News at the weekend that â€œitâ€ ™ s time for a changeâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve heard from a lot of Republicans that â€˜Gee , Iâ€ ™
d vote for somebody besides Speaker Boehner , â€ ™ but nobody will put their name out there as running so thereâ€ ™ s nobody else to vote for , â€ � Gohmert said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m putting my name out there today to be another candidate for speaker.â€ �
Gohmert said his decision was motivated by his and his colleaguesâ€ ™ frustration with Boehnerâ€ ™ s willingness to reach agreements with Democrats on basic spending legislation .
Far - right Republicans have called for an end to such agreements , with government shutdown the presumed result , in protest at President Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions on immigration and other policies .
â€œYou deceived us when you went to Obama and [ House minority leader Nancy ]
Pelosi to get your votes for the cromnibus , â€ �
Gohmert said in comments directed at Boehner over Decemberâ€ ™ s fraught passage of a spending bill .
â€œYou said youâ€ ™ d fight amnesty [ for illegal immigrants ] tooth and nail â€ “ you didnâ€

it.â€
�
The vote for speaker was to be held on Tuesday .
As many as nine House Republicans have said they may not vote for Boehner .
If 20 more members join the cause , which appears unlikely , the faction would be able to push the vote to a second round .
Boehner has been House speaker for four years and has survived several challenges from the right .
Predictions of his demise circulated after Republicans emerged from the October 2013 government shutdown with nothing to show and their approval in tatters .
But a serious challenge to Boehnerâ€ ™ s leadership failed to materialize .
Gohmert , a reliably outspoken presence at committee hearings and on news chatshows , has espoused unorthodox views on a broad range of topics .
He has accused Democrats and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Protection of waging a war on women after two American nurses contracted Ebola .
He supports the investigation of alleged â€œdeep penetrationâ€ � by the Muslim Brotherhood of the US government .
He has also opposed gays in the military , on the grounds that â€œif youâ€ ™ re sitting around getting massages all day ready to go into the big , planned battle , then youâ€ ™ re not going to last very longâ€ � .
A call to Gohmertâ€ ™ s office was not immediately returned ."
2015-01-06,"Weâ€ ™ re going to wrap our live blog coverage of kickoff day for the 114th Congress .
Hereâ€ ™ s a summary of where things stand : John Boehner handily won reelection as Speaker of the House , despite 24 Republicans voting against him ( plus one who voted present ) , in the biggest such show of dissension in a century .
The Senate wasted no time in introducing the text of a bill to compel construction of the Keystone XL pipeline .
The White House was just as quick to promise a veto .
Senator Mitch McConnell was sworn in as majority leader .
â€œA lot of hard work awaits , â€ � he told colleagues .
â€œMany important opportunities await too.â€ � Vice president

but this truly will be difficult to top :
Although Boehner has won reelection as House speaker , and in the first round of voting , the revolt against him was unusually sharp , the Washington Post notes : The voting is finished in the race for House speaker .
It appears that Boehner has won easily , although his margin is unclear .
Weâ€ ™ re waiting for the official count .
Boehner gets to 200 votes .
On the Senate side , vice president Joe Biden swears in and congratulates Mitch McConnell .
As voting for Speaker continues in the House , Republicans in the Senate have introduced their bill mandating construction of the Keystone XL pipeline .
At which the White House has promised a veto : How many votes Boehner needs to win in the first round depends on how many members are present ( 401 ) and voting ( unclear ) .
With 15 Republicans so far going against Boehner ( weâ€ ™ re in the â€˜Nâ€ ™ s ) , it appears heâ€ ™ s sailing to a double - digit victory .
Now â€œotherâ€ � is up to 14 .

What to expect out of the 114th ?
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has said he would seek to reverse what he called the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s â€œregulatory onslaughtâ€ � .
Republicans have specifically called for legislation that would counteract the presidentâ€ ™ s health care law , carbon emissions regulations , executive actions on immigration and other measures .
Republicans will introduce a bill on Tuesday to force construction of the Keystone XL pipeline , the Guardianâ€ ™ s Suzanne Goldenberg reports .
The bill is expected to pass but it faces a potential presidential veto .
â€œ[People
] are tired of inaction , â€ � McConnell said at the weekend .
â€œThey want us to act .
What does active mean ?
To give you some examples , things like approving the Keystone pipeline which would put a lot of people to work immediately , trying to do everything we can to push back against over - active bureaucracy of the current administration that has created much job loss .
For example , in my state the coal - mining industry.â€ � McConnell and the Democratic White House believe there are areas of potential consensus around international trade deals , an overhaul of the tax code , and new revenue streams for infrastructure projects .
â€œThese are all areas where there does stand the potential for bipartisan agreement , and the president is certainly going to pursue them , â€ �
the White House said Monday .
â€œThe president is also going to pursue some other things the Republicans may not like that he can do on his own.â€ � Senate minority leader Harry Reid â€ “ novel typing that â€ “ broke ribs and facial bones last week when a piece of home exercise equipment fell apart on him .

Amanda Holpuchâ€ ™ s eye falls on a tranquil scene in Washington .
Hello and welcome to our live blog coverage of the first day of a brand new Congress , the 114th .
Lest the point escape anyone , Mother Nature has blessed the proceedings with several inches of snow , resulting in total gridlock in the Washington area .
Some members flying in at the last minute were expected to be tardy .
Both the Senate and the House of Representatives are scheduled to come back to life at noon .
The spoils of the fantastic Republican victory in the 2014 midterm elections will be on display .
The GOP comes in with a whopping 246 - 188 majority in the House ( where thereâ€ ™ s one vacant seat ) and a 54 - 44 majority in the Senate ( plus two independents who will caucus with the Democrats ) .
Itâ€ ™ s a big day for Mitch McConnell , who ascends to Senate majority leader after eight years in the minority leader slot .
But it appears likely to be a more exciting day for his counterpart in the House , Speaker John Boehner , who is facing an internal party challenge to his leadership , which he is expected to smite .
What will the GOP do with its shiny new majorities ?
Weâ€
™ ll look ahead to the likely legislative battles â€ “ and potential areas for agreement â€ “ that could play out as the clock winds down on the Barack Obama presidency .
And weâ€ ™ ll take a closer look at whoâ€ ™ s who in the new legislature .
Join us as 2015 kicks off on Capitol Hill ."
2015-01-06,"John Boehnerâ€ ™ s speakership in the US House of Representatives is not long for this world â€ “ or so saith the Tea Party , which claims to have assembled a Gang of Nine to unseat him and fill his chair with Representatives Louie Gohmert or Ted Yoho .
It is an impressive list of names .
I mean , just look at it : they have a gang .
Clearly Boehner is toast .
You probably know better .
A Gang of Nine going after John Boehner is as terrifying as when the Legion of Doom tried to take over the world in a Superfriends episode .
Just replace Gohmert and Yoho with Brainiac and Gorilla Grodd and , as much as it pains me , replace Boehner with Superman .
Braniac and Grodd trying to take over the world signifies nothing ; doing so every episode is their job , as is losing .
Everyone has a role and , in the meantime , the checks keep coming .
This is how the system is designed to work .
Boehnerâ€ ™ s tenacity owes far more to the institutional structures of the modern Republican party than it does to the clownishness of his would - be deposers , even though it is incredibly tempting to chalk it up to that alone .
No one would fault you for looking at Ted Yoho and seeing an empty suit .
His biggest claim to fame â€ “ besides pig videos and being a â€œbig animalâ€ � veterinarian , which was something of a cross - promotional slam dunk â€ “ is beating a vampire - LARPing GOP primary candidate in central Florida .
He could swing a dead cat while trapped in a closet with a dozen fellow GOP reps and still not hit anyone he thinkfluenced .
His familyâ€ ™ s
iPhones all still try to autocorrect his name to Yahoo , Yoohoo , Yoda or # Yolo .
Positing that Boehner canâ€ ™ t lose because his opponent is a loser is no less tempting with Louie Gohmert , the kind of guy who could screw up a two - car funeral if you loaned him two self - driving Google vans and told him the starting point was his own house .
Sure , Louie served in the US army judge advocate general corps , but I choose to believe him when he says that the government always makes mistakes .
Later , he was an elected Texas judge , which could merely indicate that he was the guy who knew where the longest rope and the tallest tree could be found and brought a map to every campaign event .
The debate over Gohmert isnâ€ ™ t whether heâ€ ™ s stupid but whether heâ€ ™ s stupid like a fox ; itâ€ ™ s whether he is a moron who simply lived long enough until morons became an electoral majority , or if he just plays one on TV .
You can make a great case for the latter .
Gohmertâ€ ™ s idea of punking the Democratic establishment is introducing a bill with the same name as one of Obamaâ€ ™ s .
Itâ€ ™
s hard to tell if his point was to see if THE DUMBOCRATS accidentally passed his bill or if it was merely the passive trollery of , â€œLook , hereâ€ ™ s
a better billâ€ � ;
either way , itâ€ ™ s a knee slapper for the sort of people who get email updates from Townhall.com .
In fact , every bit of Gohmertâ€ ™ s career essentially reads like an email forward from the one guy in your fantasy football league who wanted the year - end prize to be investment - grade gold coins : global warming will mean more plants ; he once saw a gay soldier accidentally go to sodomize a straight one ;
moo goo dog pan ; oil pipelines are a turn - on for caribou ; terror anchor babies ; the president has visited all 57 Islamic states .
As Speaker , his policy plan would be to essentially defund everything and hold every part of the government besides the border patrol hostage in exchange for the whatever the white Christian conservative version of â€œrestoration of the Caliphateâ€ � is .
In his current position , however , Gohmert has done almost nothing of value to his constituents .
Heâ€
™ s been in Congress since 2005 and has been instrumental in authoring or passing zero critical legislation , giving the Republican base nothing to be mad at him for doing while reliably pointing at things Democrats and â€œRINOsâ€

Brat broke from Boehner over the entirely pedestrian Cromnibus Bill for all the usual fundraising - friendly reasons â€ “ Defund Obamacare !
No amnesty !
â€ “ and itâ€ ™ s hard to read his ultimately fruitless decision as anything other than fuel for the same system that made him .
David Brat claims that establishment conservatives like Boehner have no real answers ; angry conservatives send money to more angry conservative groups determined to do something with extra exclamation points .
Then they endow more chairs to make more David Brats to make more angry conservatives .

2015-01-06,"The Republican speaker of the House John Boehner survived a long - shot challenge to his leadership on Tuesday , reaffirming his authority over a restive conservative fringe in the GOP on a day in which the party cemented its power in Washington .
Shortly before Boehner was re - elected House speaker , Republican Mitch McConnell was sworn in as majority leader of the Senate .
It is the first time in eight years that Republicans have controlled both chambers of Congress .
Both McConnell and Boehner have signalled they intend to use control of the legislative branch in a constructive way , seeking areas of compromise with Barack Obama .
However , after years of bitter partisanship and acrimony , few analysts are predicting much real collaboration between the Republican - dominated Congress and the Democratic White House over the next two years .
The opening salvo portended conflict over compromise , with a major collision brewing over the proposed construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline .
Republicans have made clear that passing a bill forcing approval for construction of the pipeline will be among their first orders of business .
On Tuesday , after months of refusing to be drawn on whether Obama would approve legislation that would force his hand on Keystone approval , the White House announced that he intended to veto the Republicansâ€ ™ bill , which is expected to reach his desk in the coming days .
â€œIf
this bill passes this Congress , the president wouldnâ€ ™ t sign it ,
â€ � the White House press secretary , Josh Earnest , told reporters .
The House has passed several bills endorsing the pipelineâ€ ™ s construction in recent years .
But when it was still controlled by Democrats , the Senate remained an immovable obstacle to final passage .
Now that Republicans are in control , the measure has the support of 63 senators â€ “ all 54 Republicans as well as some Democrats â€
“ which is more than enough to overcome a filibuster .
To override Obamaâ€ ™ s veto , two - thirds of each chamber would have to vote in favor of the bill .
The House Republican rebellion against Boehner was closely watched as a test of strength of the Tea Party - aligned faction , which has flexed its muscle intermittently on key issues such as immigration , government spending and Obamaâ€ ™ s Affordable Care Act .
In the end , Boehner secured 216 of 408 votes , with 25 Republican congressmen effectively submitting a vote of no confidence in his leadership .
That was around double the number who voted against Boehner during a similar failed challenge in 2013 .
In recent days , a small but vocal band of fringe Republicans tried to rally support for a last - minute campaign against Boehner .
The same basic group of malcontents has been searching for ways to thwart and block Boehner since he became speaker in 2011 .
They are desperate for the Republican leadership to take a more confrontational stance toward Obama .
Most of the politicking takes place behind closed doors , but the public nature of the speakerâ€ ™ s election meant that Boehnerâ€ ™ s enemies voiced their objections on the House floor .
Moments after the gavel dropped to start the House session , a relatively unknown West Virginia representative , Daniel Webster , confirmed his name was in the running as a foil to Boehner .
Webster ended up acquiring the most votes of any alternative candidate except for Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic minority leader .
Other right - wing representatives â€ “ Ted Yoho , from Florida , and Louie Gohmert , from Texas â€ “ were among a slew of contenders who received votes , including , bizarrely , Rand Paul , the libertarian senator from Kentucky and former secretary of state Colin Powell .
â€œThis is not about judge Gohmert , this is about establishing a stronger check on the executive branch , â€ �
Jim Bridenstine , from Oklahoma , said when nominating his Texan ally for the speakership .
Although the tally of votes for candidates on the Republican side other than Boehner was significant â€ “ by one account the biggest revolt on a speaker vote for 100 years â€ “ the speakerâ€ ™ s allies were comfortable with his victory .
In part that is because the sheer size of the Republican majority means Boehner can lose some support at the fringe of his conference but still pass many , if not all , of his priorities .
In addition to their slender lead in the Senate , Republicans now enjoy the largest majority theyâ€ ™ ve had in the House since the Great Depression ."
2015-01-06,"Republican leaders will take control of both chambers of Congress on Tuesday , seeking to reap the gains made in Novemberâ€ ™ s midterm elections but seemingly unable to quell a revolt from the conservative wing of the party .
In a sign of divisions in the party , John Boehner , the speaker of the House of the Representatives , is expected to face a challenge to his re - election from Tea Party - aligned Republicans .
Boehner , who will preside over one of the largest Republican majorities in recent decades , is expected to easily overcome the challenge from rightwingers wary of their leadershipâ€ ™ s determination to rebuild the party .
However , the challenge to Boehner will lay bare deep fissures that remain in the GOP and lingering frustration among conservatives over the $ 1.1tn spending compromise reached with Democrats in December .
The GOP is determined to use its new power in Washington to implement legislation before the 2016 presidential elections .
The new Republican majority leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell , said he wants to overcome the partyâ€ ™ s â€œscaryâ€ � reputation and signal the GOPâ€ ™ s intention to govern as a â€œresponsible , right - of - centre , governing majorityâ€ � .
McConnell and the Democratic White House believe there are areas of potential consensus around international trade deals , an overhaul of the tax code , and new revenue streams for infrastructure projects .
â€œThese are all areas where there does stand the potential for bipartisan agreement , and the president is certainly going to pursue them , â€ � said Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s press secretary , Josh Earnest .
â€œThe president is also going to pursue some other things the Republicans may not like that he can do on his own.â€ �
He added that compromise â€œis going to be the name of the gameâ€ � in Washington now power is fully divided between the Republican - controlled Congress and the Democratic White House .
White House officials would not be drawn , however , on whether Obama will sign legislation to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline , a major priority for McConnell and Boehner expected to be among the first bills to reach the presidentâ€ ™ s desk .
Earnest said Obama â€œdoes harbor concernsâ€
� about the environmental consequences of the pipeline , and would await the outcome of related court proceedings in Nebraska , which have held up the projectâ€ ™ s authorisation .
The GOPâ€ ™ s ability to force the presidentâ€ ™
s
hand on Keystone and a number of other issues depends in part on its leadershipâ€ ™ s ability to instil discipline within the ranks .
While Boehner is expected to survive Tuesdayâ€ ™ s leadership vote , the scale of opposition will be an early test of strength for conservatives in the party , who triggered a government shutdown in 2013 and helped depose the speakerâ€ ™
s deputy , the former majority leader Eric Cantor in 2014 .
Dave Brat , who unexpectedly defeated Cantor in a Virginia primary race , was one of a several GOP hardliners to voice their opposition to Boehner .
Boehner overcame a similar challenge two years ago .
â€œWashington is broken in part because our partyâ€ ™ s leadership has strayed from its own principles of free market , limited government , constitutional conservatism , â€ � Brat recently wrote .
â€œWe are at a crucial turning point in our countryâ€ ™ s history
â€ “
do we truly want free markets , or does cronyism remain in place?â€

Two members of the House have said they are challenging Boehner for his seat .
The Texas Republican Louie Gohmert told Fox News this weekend that he is putting his name in the running because â€œitâ€ ™ s time for a change.â€ �
The Florida Republican Ted Yoho also announced this weekend that he is interested in taking over the top job in the House .
Yoho said in an email to supporters that he had voted against Boehner two years ago .
â€œI believed we needed stronger leadership then , and two years later , I still believe that today , â€ � Yoho said .
Gohmert , Yoho and Brat are in a small minority of the House caucus .
â€œThere are always malcontents , â€ � Tom Cole , an Oklahoma congressman and Boehner ally , told the Washington Post .
â€œIf you go against your own colleagues by opposing the speaker on the floor , you will embarrass House Republicans and disrupt our team .
Itâ€ ™ d be unforgivable political behaviour.â€ �
The GOP leader chiefly responsible for minimising the opposition to Boehnerâ€ ™ s re - election is Steve Scalise , the House majority whip who found himself plunged into controversy last week over his appearance a decade ago at white supremacist conference ."
2015-01-15,"The speaker of the House has offered an explanation for the apprehension of a suspect in a planned Capitol shooting at odds with the FBIâ€ ™ s description of the case .
John Boehner said on Thursday that Christopher Cornell , the 20-year old Ohio man arrested for allegedly planning a Capitol Hill shooting spree , had his plot foiled thanks to communications intercepted by US authorities .
â€œThe first thing that strikes me is that we would have never known about this had it not been for the Fisa program and our ability to collect information on people who pose an imminent threat , â€ �
Boehner said at a press conference in Hershey , Pennsylvania .
Fisa is an acronym for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , a foundational 1978 law governing the interception within the United States of communications related to foreign espionage and now terrorism .
A critical provision that updated Fisa post-9/11 , Section 215 of the Patriot Act , has been used in secret by the National Security Agency to justify the bulk collection of all US phone records .
It is set to expire on 1 June , and many civil libertarians question whether support for its reauthorization of mass domestic surveillance exists in the new Congress .
Yet according to the criminal complaint against Cornell , a secret government informant , not the communications interception covered by Fisa , was the key to the case .
The complaint , released on Wednesday , said the â€œconfidential human sourceâ€ � who sought leniency for unrelated criminal offenses â€œsupplied information to the FBI about a person using the alias of Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah ( defendant Christopher Cornell ) who posted comments and information supportive of [ the Islamic State ] through social media accountsâ€
� .
Cornellâ€ ™ s Twitter account , identified as the now - deleted @ISBlackFlags , was public , and would not have required a warrant under Fisa for law enforcement to view it .
Nor did Cornell possess ties of any substance to the Islamic State that would have prompted Fisa - authorized surveillance , the complaint indicated .
While Cornell boasted to the informant of contact with unspecified â€œpersons overseasâ€ � , the complaint said he doubted the group would authorize him to launch an attack .
â€œI believe we should just wage jihad under our own orders and plan attacks and everything , â€ � the complaint quotes Cornell as saying .
The complaint cites Cornell discussing ideas for the attack with the informant on an instant - messaging platform , the only indication the complaint provides of an interceptable electronic record of Cornellâ€ ™ s plans aside from social media .
But since Cornellâ€ ™ s interlocutor was the government informant , the informant may have simply provided the conversation to the FBI .
Cornell was arrested on Wednesday in Ohio after purchasing two M-15 rifles and approximately 600 rounds of ammunition .
The FBI referred any inquiries in the Cornell case to the criminal complaint .
Boehner did not explain how Fisa was relevant to the investigation , suggesting instead that additional information would substantiate his assertion in the coming days .
But the top Republican in Congress explicitly tied Cornell to the upcoming political battle over the expiring Patriot Act surveillance authorities .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to say this one more time because youâ€ ™ re going to hear about it for months and months to come as we attempt to reauthorize the Fisa program , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œOur government does not spy on Americans unless there are Americans who are doing things that frankly tip off law - enforcement officials to an imminent threat.â€ �"
2015-01-15,"â€œJohn Boehnerâ€ ™ s barman plotted to kill him , â€ � screeched the Daily Mail .
â€œDeer Park man charged with trying to kill Boehner , â€ � echoed the local paper , the Cincinnati Enquirer .
On the face of it , the facts appeared to merit the blazing headlines .
According to federal prosecutors , a 44-year - old man , Michael Hoyt , had expressed his desire to kill the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives by poisoning his drink ( Boehner is a lover of red wine ) at the Wetherington country club in Ohio , where Hoyt worked as a bartender .
This week , the news broke that Hoyt had been charged with threatening to kill Boehner , a serious crime that could see him spending most of the rest of his life in federal prison as he faces a maximum sentence of 30 years .
Yet another major threat to the nationâ€ ™ s safety had apparently been intercepted .
But as details of the indictment emerged , the clarity of the allegations began to blur .
At the time of his arrest in October , Hoyt no longer worked at the Wetherington country club , so the chances of him having the opportunity to follow through on the threat and actually spike the speakerâ€ ™
s drink were negligible .
He had been fired by the club the week before , having shown , his supervisor said , signs of an â€œattitude problemâ€ � .
Which is hardly surprising , in that he also showed signs of severe mental illness .
Court documents show that Hoyt considered himself at the time of his arrest to be Jesus Christ .
He was obsessively focused on Boehner because he blamed the politician for having had him fired , and saw the speaker as having been â€œresponsible for Ebolaâ€ � .
Lest there were doubts about his mental health , Hoyt added that he was hearing voices coming out of his radio , and that Boehner was the devil .
These comments were not made to other plotters as part of a criminal conspiracy .
They were blurted out directly to police officers whom Hoyt had called to his own house by dialing 911 to complain about Boehner .
What has been portrayed by the FBI as a foiled assassination plot on further probing looks more akin to an incident involving a man requiring urgent medical attention .
After he called police on 29 October , Hoyt was placed in the psychiatric wing of the University of Cincinnati hospital , from which he was transferred to the Devens federal medical center in Massachusetts on 16 December .
He is currently being evaluated at the center , which is specialized for inmates in need of mental health care .
But the order for his stay there lasts no more than 45 days .
Unless it is renewed by a judge , Hoyt is likely to find himself slipping into the clutches of the criminal justice system â€ “ where , given the severity of the indictment against him , he could remain behind bars for many years .
Groups working on mental illness say the pattern that could unfold for Hoyt is all too common .
Amid the heavy emphasis on incarceration and punishment in the US , as opposed to treatment and rehabilitation , mentally ill people are too often sucked into the criminal justice system when they should be securely cared for by medical experts .
Paul Gionfriddo , president of the advocacy group Mental Health America , pointed to studies that have found that while mental illness runs at a prevalence of about 6 % in the general population , it shoots up to 15 % among men in prison and 30 % among incarcerated women .
â€œPeople frequently associate mental illness with danger to the self or others , and that prism has defined our public policy in this country for generations .
The result is that mentally ill people often end up in prison for doing things that you and I can do without impunity , like sitting on the sidewalk , â€ � he said .
Gionfriddo knows whereof he speaks .
His son Tim , 29 , has been diagnosed with schizophrenia , and Timâ€ ™ s most frequent addresses over the past decade have been Travis County jail in Texas and San Francisco jail in California .
Mainly , heâ€ ™ s been taken in by police for breaking the terms of his probation or sitting on the sidewalk â€ “ he has never been accused of being a danger to himself or anybody else .
Michael Discioarro , a former New York prosecutor who now works as a criminal defense attorney in the city , said that â€œevery single jurisdiction in America deals with mentally ill people every single day.â€ �
But he said that was how the system was oriented , particularly when it came to something as serious as threatening a politician .
â€œHistorically , once you threaten a public figure and you take any substantial steps like buying a gun , then you are unlikely to succeed with a mental health defense .
In this country the prevailing attitude among prosecutors is that if you knew what you were doing then you should face the consequences , â€ � he said .
Which raises the billion - dollar question in the case of Michael Hoyt : did he know what he was doing ?
The criminal complaint filed on 6 November sets out the basics of what happened .
He told police officers that he could have used many things as a weapon against John Boehner â€ “ a can of gasoline , an ax , or knives .
He also had a gun and a desire to meet US president Barack Obama and a man known as â€œDr Bobâ€ � about Ebola .
Months earlier he was regularly pouring the House speakerâ€ ™ s wine , as Hoyt told John Boehnerâ€ ™ s wife Debbie in an email sent at 2 am on 28 October .
â€œIf
I had any intention of hurting Mr Boehner
I could have poisoned his wine at Wetherington , many many times .
I do not believe I have lied about anything nor exaggerated .
This is extremely urgent.â€ �
But the next day , after Hoyt had made his fateful 911 call , he pointed out to the police officer that he had been fired from his job and â€œdid not have time to put something in John Boehnerâ€ ™ s
drink.â€
�
Members knew him as â€œBartender Mikeâ€ � .
Boehner said he didnâ€ ™ t recall any negative interactions with the bartender .
Hoytâ€ ™ s supervisor told law enforcement agents that members had complained about his â€œbad behavior , â€ � and that he was fired after working there for about five years because of confrontations with patrons .
They probably didnâ€
™ t know that Hoyt had been treated for a psychotic episode in 2012 and was prescribed psychotropic medication that he stopped taking after six months .
He also had suicidal thoughts .
Police found a notebook in Hoytâ€ ™ s home in which he had scribbled â€œJohn Boehnerâ€ � and â€œEbolaâ€ � .
They also found an assault rifle magazine and loose rounds .
The actual assault rifle was missing , however , because his mother had removed it from his home .
She told agents that her son was increasingly agitated and had not been eating or sleeping .
For Jeffrey Lieberman , the chairman of Psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute , the motherâ€ ™ s plight dealing with an increasingly unwell son is a crucial part of this story .
â€œShe has a means - but itâ€ ™ s not an easy one â€ “ to get treatment , â€ � Lieberman said .
Thatâ€ ™ s something that Republican congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania , a former psychologist , is trying to fix .
He is re - introducing the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act , which would redirect the more than 11 million Americans with severe mental illnesses away from jails , prisons and the streets and back into psychiatric care .
He said heâ€ ™ s spoken to Boehner about the poisoning threat , â€œonly to say that this is the reason why we have to fix our mental health system .
Itâ€ ™ s not unlike the conversation I have daily â€ “ and it is daily , now â€ “ with members of Congress who tell me stories.â€ �
Lieberman said heâ€ ™ d like to see Boehner â€ “ whom he respects and with whom he sympathizes over the threat â€ “ reflect on this moment and use it , and his influence , â€œto help provide better mental health care services in this country.â€ �
The likelihood that Boehner will do that , though , and that change will come to America in time to help the bartender from Ohio through his illness , must be considered perilously close to none ."
2015-01-20,"The honor â€ “ and occasional curse â€ “ of delivering the Republicansâ€ ™ rebuttal to the State of the Union speech has fallen to Iowa Republican Joni Ernst , who has only been a senator for two weeks , but has credentials the party hope they can pivot to reorient the electorateâ€ ™ s perception of the GOP .
The House speaker , John Boehner , said they picked Ernst for the speech , designed to lay out the Republicansâ€ ™ position for the next year and leading up to the 2016 presidential election , because her life is â€œa quintessential only - in - America storyâ€ � , â€ “ pig castrating experience included .
That â€œonly - in - America storyâ€ � includes some Senate superlatives that will distinguish her from the primarily white and male political party .
Ernst is the only female combat veteran to serve in the Senate .
The former army lieutenant colonel served in Iraq and could use that experience to deliver the partyâ€ ™ s criticism of Obamaâ€ ™ s approach to Isis and other military operations .
Because Barack Obama has been celebrating US economic successes in the weeks leading up to his speech , the Republicans are expected to lunge on his foreign policy initiatives , or lack thereof .
Just a few years after the Republicans endured cries against their â€œwar on womenâ€
� in the 2012 election
, Ernst is one of six Republican women in the Senate .
Dianne Bystrom , director of Iowa State Universityâ€ ™ s Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics , said Ernst delivering the rebuttal was a logical choice for the GOP .
â€œThey have chosen people to give a response that have a younger and different face of the Republican party , instead of older , white representatives , â€ �
she said .
It is the second consecutive year the Republicans have chosen a woman to give the rebuttal speech .
Cathy McMorris Rodgers , a Republican representative from Washington who is the fourth most powerful Republican in the House , delivered a smooth , if uneventful , rebuttal last year .
â€œThe number one piece of advice I got last year was to hydrate , â€ �
McMorris Rodgers told the Washington Post , a reference to the moment in 2013 when the Republican senator Marco Rubio , of Florida , grabbed a bottle of water and drank from it in the middle of his speech .
NBC producers said Ernst will stand in front of an American flag , an Iowa flag , and the four flags of the military .
Behind her , will be a desk littered with trinkets from Iowa , a key battleground state in the 2016 presidential election .
â€œAny candidate is going to call on her when they visit the state , â€ � the Iowa GOP strategist Tim Albrecht told Real Clear Politics .
â€œEvery single candidate is going to want her in the room when they come here , and I think
itâ€ ™ s safe to say she will be the most popular person in the room.â€
�
The speech could be a key moment for Ernst to cement a spot on the national stage , but it also comes with the potential for career collapse .
In February 2009 , the Louisiana Republican Bobby Jindal was a rising star in the party with presidential ambitions .
That came to a rapid halt with his response to Obamaâ€ ™ s first address to a joint session of congress .
NPR said Jindalâ€ ™ s speech seemed : â€œImpertinent , immature and self - important all at the same time.â€ � The beliefs Ernst has espoused on the campaign trail led some to expect a speech loaded with provocative ideas â€ “ like her support for the idea to make English the national language and a since - reversed opinion that a UN proposal would give the organization control over Iowa farmers and their land .
She was also the only candidate in the 2014 elections to appear in a campaign ad wearing leather , riding a motorcycle and shooting a gun at Obamacare , but that aggressively conservative tone petered out in the general election .
In an ad released months earlier , she said she learned how to castrate hogs while growing up on a farm , and would use those skills in Washington .
â€œI think she flipped her message during the general election and was much more moderate in her tone , â€ � Bystrom said .
Bystrom , who studies political advertisements , said it is not unusual for candidates to be more conservative , or liberal , in primary campaigns .
To break out ahead of the crowd of primary election candidates , Ernst ran ads touting that she is â€œa mother , a soldier and a proven conservativeâ€ � .
When it came time for the general election , however , Ernst became : â€œa Mother .
Soldier .
Independent Leader.â€

2015-01-21,"The US speaker of the House of Representatives , John Boehner , has invited the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , to address a joint session of Congress on the subject of Iran next month , hours after President Obama threatened during his State of the Union address to veto any Iran sanctions bill .
The invitation , a provocative move on Boehnerâ€ ™ s part , came at a time when the president is attempting to reach a nuclear deal with Iran .
â€œIn this time of challenge , I am asking the prime minister to address Congress on the grave threats radical Islam and Iran pose to our security and way of life , â€ �
Boehner said in a statement .
If he accepts , Netanyahu will speak on 11 February on the topics of threats from Tehran and Islamic extremism , the Associated Press reported on Wednesday .
He has often spoken out against the possibility of a US - Iran deal , which he strongly opposes .
The White House called the invitation a break of normal diplomatic protocol .
Spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One the White House had not heard from Israel about whether Netanyahu had accepted the invitation .
â€œThe protocol would suggest that the leader of one country would contact the leader of another country when heâ€ ™ s traveling there .
This particular event seems to be a departure from that protocol , â€ � he said .
At a GOP House leadersâ€ ™ press conference , Boehner said that he did not consult the White House before making the invitation .
â€œCongress can make this decision on its own , â€ � he said .
Asked by CNNâ€ ™ s Dana Bash if this was a way of poking â€œthe president in the eyeâ€ � , Boehner demurred .
â€œI donâ€
™ t believe Iâ€ ™ m poking anyone in the eye .
There is a serious threat that exists in the world and the president last night kind of papered over it , â€ � he said .
â€œYou may have seen that on Friday , the president warned us not to move ahead with sanctions on Iran , a state sponsor of terror , â€ �
Boehner told a meeting of Republicans Wednesday morning , according to Politico .
â€œHis exact message to us was : â€˜Hold your fire.â€ ™
He expects us to stand idly by and do nothing while he cuts a bad deal with Iran .
Two words : Hell no !
â€
¦ Weâ€ ™ re going to do no such thing.â€ �
The Associated Press contributed to this report ."
2015-01-21,"Republicans cut Barack
Obamaâ€ ™ s most forceful comments on climate change â€ “ his mockery of climate denial â€ “ from the partyâ€ ™ s official live stream of his State of the Union address .
A purported Republican fact - check of Obamaâ€ ™ s address , prepared by staffers for the House speaker , John Boehner , clumsily cuts the president off mid - sentence just as he was about to wreck the Republicansâ€ ™ new default line for talking about climate change : â€œI am not a scientist.â€ �
The Republican party leadership has adopted wholesale the â€œI am not a scientistâ€ � line over the last few months
â€ “ casting doubt about climate change while avoiding outright denial .
Boehner resorted to the line as recently as last week when asked directly about his position on climate change .
In the full version of the speech , as seen by millions in America and around the world , Obama said : â€œ Iâ€ ™ ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying theyâ€ ™ re not scientists ; that we donâ€ ™ t have enough information to act .
Well , Iâ€ ™ m not a scientist , either .
But you know what â€ “
I know a lot of really good scientists at Nasa , and Noaa , and at our major universities.â€ �
Those words however did not make the cut in the official House Republican version , billed as an â€œenhanced webcastâ€ � that would be â€œholding President Obama accountable in real - timeâ€ � .
The Republican version also avoided the subsequent lines in which Obama said : â€œThe Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security .
We should act like it.â€
�
There is no reference to the Pentagon in the Republican version .
The cut to the â€œI am not a scientist lineâ€ �
â€ “ which abruptly hits Obama off mid - sentence â€
“ was first spotted by commenters on Reddit following the speech .
There was no immediate response from Boehnerâ€ ™ s office .
However , the outgoing White House adviser , John Podesta , accused Boehner of trying to re - write the record .
â€œClimate deniers are already on the wrong side of history , are now trying to airbrush it , â€ � Podesta tweeted ."
2015-01-23,"The White House is growing more confident it can withstand efforts to frustrate its policy of nuclear talks with Iran , as a furore over the intervention of the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , appears to be encouraging wavering Democrats to rally around their president .
In the first White House press conference since the Republican House speaker , John Boehner , sparked controversy by inviting Netanyahu to speak before a joint session of Congress amid calls for a tougher approach to Iran , administration officials claimed there was support for their argument that planned legislation authorising new sanctions , if talks fail , would be counter - productive .
â€œI think there is plenty of indication that the â€ ¦ at least some members of Congress have found this rather plausible line of argument pretty persuasive , â€ � the White House spokesman , Josh Earnest , told reporters .
Netanyahu is scheduled to address Congress on 3 March .
He will also attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( Aipac ) conference in Washington scheduled for 1 - 3 March .
Earnest refused to speculate on a likely vote count , but sympathetic lobbyists in touch with Democratic congressmen claim the polarising impact of Boehnerâ€ ™ s invitation to Netanyahu is making it harder for Republicans to reach a veto - proof majority for the sanctions bill .
â€œThis move by Netanyahu has definitely backfired in terms of Democrats , â€ � said Dylan Williams , director of government affairs at J - Street , a Washington lobby group which describes itself as pro - Israel but supports a two - state peace process for a Palestinian state .
J - Street sent out a letter to its US supporters on Friday , urging them to warn their congressmen not to support the visit , which will fall just two weeks before elections in Israel .
â€œThis invitation looks like a thinly veiled attempt to scuttle the critical negotiations taking place right now aimed at ensuring that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon , â€ � said the letter .
â€œBibi and Obama disagree on how to deal with Iran , and thatâ€ ™ s fair .
But a foreign leader lobbying Congress is inappropriate.â€ �
On Friday a senior Israeli opposition figure , Tzipi Livni , accused Netanyahu of leading the country into â€œcrisis and diplomatic isolationâ€ � , amid growing criticism of his handling of relations with the US .
An unnamed senior US official was quoted by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz as saying : â€œWe thought weâ€ ™ ve seen everything .
But Bibi managed to surprise even us .
â€œThere are things you simply donâ€ ™ t do .
He spat in our face publicly and thatâ€ ™ s no way to behave .
Netanyahu ought to remember that President Obama has a year and a half left to his presidency , and that there will be a price.â€
�
There is also concern among some Israeli - Americans that the incident may damage broader relations between the two countries .
The national director of the Anti - Defamation League , Abraham Foxman , called on Boehner to rescind the invitation , arguing : â€œI certainly support the sanctions [ on Iran ] if the [ diplomatic ] deal doesnâ€ ™ t come through , but having said that , the invitation and acceptance is ill - advised for either side .
It is too important an issue to politicise it.â€ �
Williams added : â€œThe greatest danger from this is that it damages the long - term principle of bipartisan support for the special relationship with Israel.â€ �
The White House again dismissed claims that Obama will snub Netanyahu , though the president said on Thursday he would not meet the prime minister during the visit .
The White House said this was in keeping with a practice that discourages US presidents from meeting with world leaders ahead of elections .
â€œDespite some of the differences of opinion we have with the current Israeli prime minister , [ it ] doesnâ€ ™ t undermine our commitment to Israeliâ€ ™ s security , â€ � said Earnest .
â€œOur differences of opinion about the strategy we should pursue to resolve the international communityâ€ ™ s concerns about Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear program are
longstanding.â€ � Earnest said it is ultimately the speakerâ€ ™ s responsibility to make decisions about the House floor schedule .
â€œCertainly if we had the opportunity to weigh in on that plan a bit more we would welcome that opportunity and make a variety of changes , â€ � said Earnest .
Earnest said he would â€œcertainly notâ€ �
quantify
Obamaâ€ ™ s
level of irritation at Boehnerâ€ ™ s decision , though the White House said it was a â€œdeparture from protocolâ€ � for world leaders to plan trips to the US without speaking to the president .
Earnest said Obama had spent more time talking to Netanyahu than any other world leader , because of the â€œclear national security interestâ€ � of communicating with an ally in the Middle East .
â€œThis president has certainly not allowed the disagreement over our Iran approach to anyway shape the commitment of the United States to the security of Israel , â€ � Earnest said ."
2015-01-25,"White House chief of staff Denis McDonough moved to defuse a dispute over Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahuâ€ ™ s
upcoming trip to Washington on Sunday , calling relationships between the two countries â€œmany faceted , deep and abidingâ€ � .
Administration officials told Israelâ€ ™ s
Haaretz last week Netanyahu had â€œspatâ€
� in Obamaâ€ ™ s face by arranging with Republican House speaker John Boehner to speak before Congress in March without first informing the White House .
The comment â€œdoes not reflect the views of this president or this White Houseâ€ � , McDonough told CBS .
He said the importance of the relationship meant it was â€œabove partisan politicsâ€ � .
McDonough appeared on all the USâ€ ™ s major morning politics shows on Sunday â€ “ a move known as â€œthe full Ginsburgâ€ � after William Ginsburg , an attorney for Monica Lewinsky who first completed the circuit in 1998 .
On ABCâ€ ™ s
This Week , NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press ,
CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation ,
CNNâ€ ™ s
State of the Union and Fox News
Sunday , McDonough defended White House positions on Yemen , Isis and other issues , and was at pains throughout to stress that relations with Israel remained strong .
The relationship is â€œfocused on a shared series of threats , but also , on a shared series of values that one particular instance is not going to inform overwhelmingâ€ � , he told NBC .
Briefing his cabinet on Sunday , Netanyahu said : â€œIn coming weeks , the powers are liable to reach a framework agreement with Iran , an agreement liable to leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state .
â€œAs prime minister of Israel , I am obligated to make every effort to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weaponry that will be aimed at the state of Israel.â€
�
The Israeli prime ministerâ€ ™ s US visit will come shortly before Israel goes to the polls .
He is expected to call on Congress to for tougher sanctions against Iran at a time when the US is trying to coordinate talks to secure a final comprehensive deal over Iranian nuclear programmes .
The White House has said that the president on principle does not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections , in order to avoid the appearance of influencing elections in a foreign country .
â€œWhat we wonâ€ ™ t allow us to do is for us to become an issue in their elections .
Thatâ€ ™ s why the president was clear this week we should not meet with prime minister Netanyahu just two weeks before his elections , â€ �
McDonough told CBS .
Senator John McCain , the Republican chairman of the armed services committee , told the same show it was important that Netanyahu â€œspeak to the American peopleâ€ � .
â€œRelations have never been worse between ourselves and the only genuine democracy in the entire Middle East , â€ �
he said .
He said Israel was convinced that US negotiations with Iran would ultimately lead to Iranian acquisition of a nuclear weapon , â€œwhich will then nuclearise the entire Middle East and that will then be a direct threat to the existence of the state of Israelâ€ � ."
2015-01-27,"With Republicans finally in control of Congress and the Latino vote for 2016 already hanging in the balance , the House speaker , John Boehner , has announced his latest strategy for torpedoing Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive action on immigration reform : try to sue the president .
One more time .
Despite the objections of some scholars on presidential privilege following a congressional suit on the presidentâ€ ™ s healthcare law last year , Boehner reportedly told party members at a closed - door session on Tuesday that he is â€œfinalizingâ€ � legal options .
This time , the challenge apparently focuses on a White House order from November regarding documentation for 11 million people living in the US .
Whether the legal action from Congress would apply to Obamaâ€ ™ s order on so - called â€œdeferred actionâ€ � for child immigrants remains unclear , according to National Journal .
In the hours leading up to Tuesdayâ€ ™ s meeting , Republicans in the House postponed a vote on a border security bill maligned by conservatives and Democrats alike .
Republican leaders blamed the delay on a north - east snowstorm , while many critics sought to jump on the legislative change as a fresh example of Republicans having a difficult time aligning in their first month in power of both chambers of Congress .
â€œThere have been a couple of stumbles , â€ �
Boehner said at a press conference on Tuesday .
The House has managed to approve a Department of Homeland Security funding bill that is loaded with amendments attacking parts of Obamaâ€ ™ s executive action .
The administration has issued a veto threat on the bill .
Sean Theriault , an associate professor of government at the University of Texas , said Boehner must walk a fine line in appeasing members of his party without making things awkward for a cast of potential Republican presidential nominees who are already beginning to court voters for whom immigration is a top issue .
â€œOn the one hand , he has a bunch of fire - breathing conservatives bearing down his neck , mandating that he do something ,
â€ �
Theriault said .
â€œBut then there is the practical realities that he is a member of the Republican party that would like to once again some day be again in the White House.â€ �
The Latino vote is widely credited for edging Obama ahead in the past two presidential elections .
An estimated 28 million Latinos will be eligible to vote by the 2016 election , according to a May 2014 report by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials .
A swift move to push back against executive action on immigration matters less in the presidential primaries , Theriault said , when the specifics of the documentation issue tends to be less of a focus than the fuller prospect of , say , Jeb Bush as candidate .
â€œItâ€ ™ s certainly more popular than not among their constituents , but their constituents alone canâ€ ™ t elect the next president , â€ � said Theriault .
Ruben Gallego , a Democratic representative from Arizona , said the legal threat reveals a Republican party focused on â€œanti - immigrant politicsâ€ � .
â€œInstead of doing their job and working to pass a bill that addresses our immigration system once and for all , Republicans are trying to one up themselves to prove to the extreme wing of their party just how anti - immigrant they are , â€ � Gallego said .
A suit would not be the first against the executive action on Obamaâ€ ™ s plan to shield undocumented immigrants â€ “ governors from 25 states have also filed suit against the action in the case Texas v United States .
If the suit progresses and were to directly name Obama , however , it could be the first instance of Congress directly suing the president of the United States .
The House of Representatives as a whole has never sued the president , according to Politifact .
Suits can be brought against other members of the executive branch as stand - ins for the administrationâ€ ™ s policies , as with another suit orchestrated by Boehner .
As Republicans became increasingly frustrated with Obamaâ€ ™ s use of the power of his office to act without the other branches , the House in July authorized a challenge to Obama administrationâ€
™ s implementation of the Affordable Care Act , but did not name the president as a defendant .
The suit was officially filed in November 2014 , a day after Obama announced his executive action on immigration .
â€œSo sue me , â€ � the president said at the time ."
2015-02-03,"Kentucky senator Rand Paul backpedalled Tuesday on comments he made about vaccines that quickly drew the condemnations of everyone from medical professionals to senior Republican party members to the formerly quarantined healthcare provider best remembered for calling out Paulâ€ ™ s potential rival for the White House .
Paulâ€ ™ s attempt at clarification landed as Republicans in Washington , from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to House speaker John Boehner to the dozen or so members of the prospective 2016 presidential field scrambled to describe their views on vaccination .
Following controversial comments by New Jersey governor Chris Christie regarding a measles outbreak spreading across the US , Paul set off another cascade of criticism when he told CNBC on Monday that vaccinations could lead to â€œprofound mental disordersâ€ � and that parents â€œshould have some inputâ€ � .
In his follow - up statement , Paul sought to make a distinction between correlation and causation â€ “ the kind of science - minded distinction that some of his critics saw him as abandoning .
â€œI did not say vaccines caused disorders , just that they were temporally related â€
“
I did not allege causation , â€ � Paul said in a statement .
â€œI support vaccines , I receive them myself and I had all of my children vaccinated .
In fact today , I received the booster shot for the vaccines I got when I went to Guatemala last year.â€ �
The senator added a tweet for good measure : The explanation attempt came after Paulâ€ ™ s initial remarks were condemned by medical experts and contradicted by top members of Paulâ€ ™ s own party â€ “ and not just because the senator â€œshushedâ€ � his interviewer .
Boehner dismissed Paulâ€ ™ s comments in a reply to reporters on Tuesday : â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if we need another law , but I do believe all children ought to be vaccinated , â€ � Boehner said .
Kaci Hickox , the nurse who found herself in the middle of a political firestorm last year after she was quarantined upon her return from west Africa despite never contracting Ebola , joined the chorus of critics on Tuesday .
â€œI am very disappointed with Rand Paulâ€
™ s statements , â€ �
Hickox told the Guardian in a phone interview .
â€œI know
heâ€
™ s a physician , but the science is very clear , and I hope that he and other leaders consider the different sides of an issue before making statements about vaccines that are unfounded in science .
â€œI
wouldnâ€ ™ t trust anyone in a leadership position who wasnâ€ ™ t following the science ,
â€ �
she added when asked about comments about vaccinations this week from other potential candidates .
Governor Christie , whose Ebola policy led to a mandatory 21-day quarantine for Hickox against her will , kicked off the most recent public health tempest during a trip to London by saying that in setting vaccinations policy , the government must strike a â€œbalanceâ€ � between public health and parental discretion .
In an immediate attempt to squash the criticism , a Christie spokesman issued a follow - up statement , saying : â€œWith a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.â€ � Rand Paul , disruptive political idealist Longtime observers of Paulâ€ ™ s political career â€ “ and his record on issues from climate change to the handling of Ebola cases â€ “ saw the same Paul they have always known : more faithful to libertarian principles than to science .
On the vaccines issue , however , Paul may have arrived at a juncture where his political philosophy loses its traction on public policy â€ “ and potentially limits his appeal to a broader constituency .
â€œThe meta - message that heâ€ ™ s sending is definitely libertarian and directed at this base , which , unlike most politicians , I think heâ€ ™ s consciously trying to expand , â€ � said Al Cross , director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky .
â€œIf he can find a way to say something that his base both subscribes to , and general listeners can say , â€˜Yes , well , I agree with thatâ€ ™ â€ “ that has the gradual effect of expanding the base .
â€œHe does seem to be a skeptic of science in more than one regard.â€ � Paulâ€ ™ s career , from the time he was a practicing ophthalmologist in Kentucky , has always been marked by disruptive political idealism .
An objection to the certification policies of the American Board of Ophthalmology led Paul to form his own certification system .
He has used his medical background to summon political authority , as when he criticized the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s handling of Ebola patients in the United States last fall .
Warning that the disease was easier to catch than Aids and suggesting that medical officials were mishandling the outbreak , Paul said of White House officials : â€œYou start to wonder about a basic level of competence.â€ �
Ultimately , the Ebola protection measures proved sufficient .
But Paul gave voice to the same authority he seeks on other issues , including man - made climate change .
Paul describes the science behind man - made climate change as inconclusive .
â€œSomebody tell me what 100
yearsâ€ ™ data is in an Earth that is 4.6 billion years
old?â€ �
he said last spring in a conversation with former presidential adviser David Axelrod .
â€œMy guess is that the conclusions you make from that are not conclusive.â€ �
Paul has been similarly slow to heed scientific warnings of dangers to his constituents from pollution due to coal - mining practices such as mountaintop removal , said Thom Kay of the pro - environment nonprofit group Appalachian Voices .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s really shown no sign that he cares about any of the science that says how bad mountaintop - removal coal mining is for water quality , â€ �
Kay said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the sort of thinking that I think he takes to climate change.â€ �
Kay said that Paul had not sought ways to move the costs associated with environmentally harmful mining away from residential communities and back to coal companies .
â€œItâ€ ™ s against his political beliefs to shift those costs back to a company , and because of that , it seems really difficult for him even to admit that carbon dioxide is real pollution , or that dumping coal - mining waste into streams is going to pollute the streams , â€ �
Kay said .
â€œThe science is really clear on it
â€
¦
But instead of recognizing any of that , he sort of ignores it .
More so than denies it.â€ � Cross , of the University of Kentucky , said Paul was generally good at speaking to multiple audiences .
â€œHe has this rhetorical trope of phrasing things in a way that it sounds to the people out there on the fringe
that heâ€ ™ s agreeing with them , â€ � said Cross .
â€œBut if you really parse his statements , heâ€ ™ s leaving himself room for fact - based logical dialogue .
When he says something like , â€˜there has to be a role for parentsâ€ ™ â€ “ well , most people can agree with that.â€ � Measles cases in 14 states have been tied to an initial case in December at Disneyland theme park in southern California .
Confirmed cases include five Disney employees .
The Centers for Disease Control counted 102 measles cases total in January , a year after the worst outbreak of measles since its elimination was documented in the United States in 2000 , with 644 cases recorded in 27 states in 2014 .
â€œThe stakes are high and this is a disease that weâ€ ™ re seeing , â€ �
Hickox told the Guardian .
â€œThe current outbreak is over 100 , but those numbers will probably continue to grow because of the infectiousness of measles.â€ �
Another prominent doctor turned political figure who is expected to seek the Republican nomination in 2016 , Ben Carson , also injected himself into the measles debate on Tuesday .
â€œAlthough I strongly believe in individual rights and the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit , I also recognize that public health and public safety are extremely important in our society , â€ � Carson said in a statement .
At a hearing on the underwhelming flu vaccine before the House energy and commerce subcommittee , one congressman read part of Paulâ€ ™ s interview aloud and asked the four scientists before him what they thought .
The senatorâ€ ™ s comments were not backed up by science , the witnesses all said ."

The House speaker , John Boehner , said on Thursday that the pope will visit the US Capitol in Washington on 24 September , where he is scheduled to be the first pontiff to address a joint meeting of Congress .
â€œIt will be a historic visit , and we are truly grateful that His Holiness has accepted our invitation , â€ �
Boehner said in a statement .
Last month , Francis announced that he would be visiting Washington DC , New York and Philadelphia in September .
It is his first trip to the US since becoming the pontiff .
â€œIn a time of global upheaval , the Holy Fatherâ€ ™ s message of compassion and human dignity has moved people of all faiths and backgrounds , â€ � said Boehner .
â€œHis teachings , prayers and very example bring us back to the blessings of simple things and our obligations to one another .
We look forward to warmly welcoming His Holiness to our Capitol and hearing his address on behalf of the American people.â€
�
Last month , Boehner announced that Congress had invited another world leader to address a joint session of Congress â€ “ the Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu .
Neither Boehner nor Netanyahu cleared the trip with the White House .
Though the details of Francisâ€ ™ s itinerary are not yet known , in Congress he will face an audience grappling with issues Francis has championed , like immigration , climate change and relations between the US and Cuba .
The immigration battle in Congress took on new urgency after Obama announced executive actions to help protect undocumented migrants in the US .
Republicans are hoping to undo these actions , while the White House has threatened to veto legislation that tries to block them .
Francis , meanwhile , has decried conditions at the US - Mexico border and said that he would have liked to enter the US through the Mexico border as a â€œsign of brotherhood and of help to the immigrantsâ€ � , but his schedule does not have enough space for such a trip .
He is also hoping to influence this yearâ€ ™ s UN climate meeting in Paris , according to papal representatives .
Delegates from around the globe are gathering in Paris as part of a UN - led attempt to end 20 years of negotiations on how to reduce emissions and better address climate change .
In 2015 , the pope is due to speak about the issue in an address to the 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide and the UN general assembly .
He is also to call a summit of the main global religions to discuss the climate .
Climate change discussions in Congress , however , are more stilted .
Last month , the Senate voted 98 - 1 that climate change is not a hoax .
A majority of those voting agreed that climate change is caused in part by human activity , including 15 Republicans .
But at least 19 members of Congress have made comments denying climate change .
This week , Congress has also held three hearings on Cuba - US ties , in response to the December announcement that the two countries are easing diplomatic relations .
The Republican senator Marco Rubio of Florida has been a vocal critic of the plan and said in a hearing that he did not support the policies â€œfor the simple reason that I donâ€
™ t think they will be effectiveâ€ � .
Barack Obama has said Francis played an important role in getting US and Cuba to reopen diplomatic relations .
The Vatican sent letters to Obama and the Cuban president , RaÃºl Castro , asking the two to consider resolving their strained relations on humanitarian grounds .
The Vatican also hosted meetings between delegations from the two countries â€ “ which were said to have been where important breakthroughs in the discussions were made .
Francis is expected to meet with Obama at the White House .
At the national prayer breakfast on Thursday , Obama said he is looking forward to welcoming him to the US .
â€œLike
so many people around the world , Iâ€ ™ ve been touched by his call to relieve suffering , and to show justice and mercy and compassion to the most vulnerable , â€ �
Obama said .
â€œHe challenges us to press on in what he calls our â€˜march of living hopeâ€ ™
.â€ �
Pope Francis said he was traveling to the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia .
This event is held every three years and organizers say it is the â€œworldâ€ ™ s largest Catholic gathering of familiesâ€ � .
And along with his address to Congress , he plans to hold a controversial sainthood ceremony for JunÃ­pero Serra , the 18th - century Spanish Franciscan priest who set up a mission in California ."
2015-02-05,"Three prominent US Democrats have threatened to skip Binyamin Netanyahuâ€ ™ s address to Congress next month amid growing anger over what they perceive as partisan lobbying by the Israeli prime minister .
Netanyahu risked upsetting the usual bipartisan support for Israel on Capitol Hill when he accepted an invitation from the Republican House speaker , John Boehner , to discuss their shared concerns over the US administrationâ€ ™ s negotiations with Iran .
The White House said it had not been consulted over the invitation , which it called a breach of diplomatic protocol , and said Barack Obama would not meet the Israeli leader during his trip .
But the rift appears to be spreading this week with representatives John Lewis , GK Butterfield and Earl Blumenauer confirming that they would not be attending the event on 3 March and the minority leader , Nancy Pelosi , warning that others may discover similar â€œdiary clashesâ€ � .
On Wednesday , the White House press secretary , Josh Earnest , refused to even confirm whether Vice - President Joe Biden would attend , saying it would also depend on his availability .
As president of the Senate , the vice - president normally sits behind visiting heads of state when they make a joint address to both chambers of Congress .
Irritation among Democrats at what they see as being forced to choose between supporting Israel or supporting their president boiled over into outright anger on Wednesday night as the veteran New York congressman Charles Rangel used his speech at the annual press club congressional dinner to stage a mock phone call with Netanyahu , berating him for interfering in domestic US politics .
Netanyahu and Boehner both fear that the suspension of Iranian sanctions during talks aimed at preventing it from developing nuclear weapons have weakened international resolve to contain the threat and would like to see Congress pass legislation authorising new sanctions if a deal is not reached .
But Obama and other western allies , such as Britain and France , have warned that even passing such legislation would give Iranian conservatives an excuse to walk away from the talks and lead to military confrontation instead .
The Israeli embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian but is said to have been holding unsuccessful talks on Capitol Hill to try to repair relations with Democrats .
Pelosi insisted those choosing not to attend should not be described as boycotters .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think anybody should use the word â€˜boycottâ€ ™ ,â€ � she told reporters .
â€œWhen these heads of state come , people are here doing their work , theyâ€ ™ re trying to pass legislation , theyâ€ ™ re meeting with their constituents and the rest .
Itâ€ ™ s not a high - priority item for them
, â€ � she said .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s an affront to the president and the State Department what the speaker did , â€ � congressman John Lewis , one of those saying he will not attend , told Associated Press .
Congressman Butterfield told AP he was â€œvery disappointed the speaker would cause such a ruckusâ€ � with the invitation .
Blumenauer , who last week called on Boehner to cancel the joint session with Netanyahu , said : â€œItâ€ ™ s deeply troubling that the speaker is willing to undercut diplomacy in exchange for theatrics on the House floor.â€ �"
2015-02-25,"Declaring â€œweâ€ ™ re in a wait - and - see modeâ€ � , House speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday he had no plans to call a vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) beyond a Friday night deadline , bringing the prospect of a partial shutdown a step closer .
In an appearance following a meeting of House Republicans , Boehner repeatedly demanded that the Senate vote on legislation passed by the House earlier this month , which would fund homeland security but block Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions on immigration .
â€œIâ€ ™ m waiting for the Senate to pass a bill , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know what the Senate is capable of .
Iâ€ ™ m waiting for the Senate to act .
Itâ€ ™ s time for the Senate to do their job.â€ �
Under a spending deal struck in mid - December , DHS funding is set to run out at midnight on Friday .
The rest of the government is funded through the end of the fiscal year on 30 September .
Democrats in the Senate have blocked repeated attempts by the majority leader , Mitch McConnell , to bring a vote on the House bill , prompting McConnell to announce a shift in strategy that could provide a path toward funding Homeland Security while allowing Republicans to vote against the presidentâ€ ™ s immigration policy .
McConnell said on Tuesday that he would bring a bill to the floor to fully fund the DHS .
He said he would also call a vote on a second bill to reverse the presidentâ€ ™ s executive actions on immigration â€ “ legislation inviting a presidential veto , should it pass both chambers of Congress .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know whatâ€ ™ s not to like about this ,
â€ �
McConnell said .
â€œThis is an approach that respects both points of view and gives senators an opportunity to go on record on both , both funding the Department of Homeland Security and expressing their opposition to what the president did
last November.â€ �
On Wednesday , Senate Democrats offered to support McConnellâ€ ™ s new proposal , despite some hesitancy when it was first announced .
â€œWe hope that we can do this tomorrow , â€ �
minority leader Harry Reid told reporters on Capitol Hill .
â€œWe are going to do everything we can to make sure that it passes in time : this is no time for games.â€ �
McConnell may need Democrat help to speed the funding legislation to the Senate floor amid continued grumbling on the right of his party .
Such a pattern is expected to be repeated in the House if , as expected , Boehner eventually climbs down and permits a vote on a â€œcleanâ€ � funding bill later this week .
But if Boehner saw a chance for the McConnell strategy gaining support in the House , he gave no sign of it on Wednesday .
Boehner told his caucus he had not spoken to McConnell in two weeks , according to a report from inside the meeting .
But staff members for the two legislators had been in contact , Boehner said .
â€œSenator McConnell has a big job to do , â€ � said Boehner .
â€œIn the end the Senate has
to act.â€ �
Late last year the president announced an expansion of the pool of undocumented migrants eligible for deferred action on deportations .
The actions extended protections from deportations to about 4 million people .
House Republicans had signalled their opposition to McConnellâ€ ™ s plan in advance of Wednesdayâ€ ™ s caucus meeting .
The approach â€œis tantamount to surrender , and wonâ€ ™ t meet with support in the peopleâ€ ™ s
Houseâ€ � , said representative Matt Salmon of Arizona .
â€œI will fight against any funding bill that does not fully defund the presidentâ€ ™ s illegal actions.â€ �
Boehner said the House had â€œdone its job to fund the Department of Homeland Security and to stop the presidentâ€ ™ s overreachâ€ � on immigration .
A DHS shutdown would leave the majority of agency employees , including Transportation Security Administration agents and most Border Patrol agents , at their posts as designated essential staff .
But if the shutdown ground on they would not receive bi - weekly paychecks .
Pressure on Republicans to ensure DHS does not partially shut down grew at the weekend , with the release by the Somalia - based al - Shabaab terrorist group of a video threatening attacks on American malls .
Obama was scheduled to participate on Wednesday afternoon in an immigration town hall in Miami , hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC at Florida International University ."
2015-02-27,"John Boehnerâ€ ™ s first attempt to keep the Department of Homeland Security from running out of money at midnight failed in the House of Representatives after more than 50 Republicans baulked at his plan to fund it for just three more weeks .
The House speaker had been hoping to prevent a shutdown by buying time to negotiate with conservatives in his caucus over their demands that the bill include a measure to prevent Barack Obama from deferring deportation of undocumented immigrants .
But even this three - week stop gap was rejected by 52 Republican congressmen who defied their party leadership and joined with Democrats to voted against the bill by 224 to 203 just after 5 pm .
The department runs out of funds at midnight .
Majority leader Kevin McCarthy concluded by saying : â€œMembers are advised that additional votes are possible later this evening and may be
this weekend.â€ �
Democrats resisted Boehnerâ€ ™ s proposal in the hope of forcing House Republicans to follow their colleagues in the Senate and agree a one - year funding bill .
The Senate later approved a bill to ensure funding for the department for one week as efforts continued to break the impasse .
The parties spent Friday evening in a dangerous game of chicken , waiting to see who would blink first before current funding for the department expires at midnight .
Without funding , the department will be unable to pay tens of thousands of border guards , coast guards and other DHS staff , who will nevertheless have to turn up to work as they are deemed â€œessential workersâ€ � ."
2015-03-01,"House speaker John Boehner on Sunday dismissed reports that conservative rivals are planning to oust him following a deal to avert a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , amidst rumours that he promised a vote on a â€œclean billâ€ � on the issue next week .
Reports of a coup against Boehner began over the weekend , following a last - minute vote in the House of Representatives which secured just one additional week of DHS funding .
Boehner had earlier failed to secure a three - week funding extension following a revolt of more than 50 conservative Republicans , who argued the move was a concession to the White House in the battle over Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions on immigration .
Speaking to CBS on Sunday , Boehner argued that dissent within the party was only over tactics , adding that he was still committed to fighting Obamaâ€ ™ s executive action , which will defer deportation for more than 5 million undocumented immigrants in the US .
â€œWe do have some members who disagree from time to time over the tactics we decide to employ , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œRemember , Republicans are united behind the idea that the president has far exceeded his constitutional authority and we all want to do things to stop the president from his illicit activities.â€ � Boehner reportedly promised the Democratic House minority leader Nancy Pelosi a vote on a â€œclean billâ€ � next week .
Asked what assurances he had given to Pelosi , Boehner was elusive .
â€œThe promise I made to Miss Pelosi is the same promise I made to Republicans , that we would follow regular order , â€ � he said .
Asked if he believed he could continue to lead the House in the face of opposition from conservative members of his own party , Boehner replied : â€œI think so , I think so .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to suggest itâ€ ™ s easy because itâ€ ™ s not .
But remember whatâ€ ™ s causing this .
Itâ€ ™ s the president of the United States overreaching.â€ �
Jim Jordan , a member of the so - called â€œfreedom caucusâ€ � who voted against Boehnerâ€ ™ s DHS proposal on Friday , appeared on CNN and repeatedly denied there was a move to oust the speaker .
Asked three times if he would back a move to get rid of the the speaker , Jordan responded : â€œThatâ€ ™ s not going to happen .
Thatâ€ ™ s not the issue.â€
�
Some Republicans have expressed outrage at the tactics of their more conservative colleagues during Fridayâ€ ™ s vote .
Congressman Devin Nunes , a Boehner supporter , described the 52 Republicans who voted against the three - week DHS extension as â€œphony conservative membersâ€ � . â€œI prefer to be in the arena voting than trying to placate a small group of phony conservative members who have no credibly policy proposals and no political strategy to stop Obamaâ€ ™ s lawlessness , â€ �
Nunes told the LA Times .
Before the last - minute deal was passed on Friday , the White House prepared contingency instructions for the thousands of DHS workers who would be affected by a partial shutdown of the department .
Boehner said he would push for a joint conference between the House and the Senate to nail down terms of continued DHS funding .
The Senate passed a longer - term â€œcleanâ€ � funding bill on Friday , containing no mention of the presidentâ€ ™ s executive actions ."
2015-03-02,"Republicans failed in their latest attempt to wield the threat of a partial government shutdown as a weapon of protest against Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s immigration policies on Monday , with Democrats and the White House increasingly confident they have the upper - hand in the showdown .
In the Senate , Democrats blocked an attempt by Republicans to force negotiations between both sides of the legislature over a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security .
The failed vote immediately put pressure on the Republican speaker of the House , John Boehner , who is stuck between the mutinous conservative fringe of his own party and the need to fund the DHS , a critical government agency that runs out of money at the end of this week .
Both parties are blaming each other for the impasse .
But the gridlock is most damaging to Republicans who , four months after electoral gains that gave them control over both chambers of the legislature , have allowed bitter internal divisions to impede effective government .
Boehnerâ€ ™ s inability to rally the support of his own caucus last week led the humiliation of a short - term fix , aided by Democrats at the eleventh hour , which only kept the government agency funded for a week .
Republicans had hoped to use a Senate motion to force inter - chamber negotiations over DHS funding , but needed to secure at least 60 votes for the procedure to succeed .
The measure secured 47 votes , with 43 opposed â€ “ well short of the threshold required .
The outcome had been widely expected ; minority leader Harry Reid had already signalled Democrats would vote against the measure , describing it as â€œthe very definition of an exercise in futilityâ€ � .
â€œWe will not be party to another charade by House Republicans ,
â€ � he said .
The failed vote left Boehner , who has repeatedly kicked the immigration can down the road , running out of options .
Privately , operatives from both parties believe a â€œcleanâ€ �
DHS funding bill passed by the Senate â€ “ which leaves Obamaâ€ ™ s immigration provisions untouched and keeps the DHS funded until September â€ “ would pass if put to a vote in the House .
However recalcitrant conservatives in the lower chamber are promising a revolt against Boehner if any such legislation reaches the floor of the House .
They are determined to make funding for the DHS contingent upon provisions that would effectively nullify executive orders signed by Obama that shield millions of undocumented migrants from the threat of deportation .
Democrats are increasingly confident Boehner will have no option but to relent , allowing the Senateâ€ ™ s bipartisan bill to be put to a vote .
The speaker is widely rumoured to have struck a deal with House Democrats on Friday , promising that the clean bill would be provided floor time in exchange for Fridayâ€ ™ s short - term fix , which avoided the partial government shutdown that would have been a public relations disaster for the GOP .
Republicans leaders are publicly denying any such deal was made .
However Steny Hoyer of Maryland , the second - ranking House Democrat , who was involved in Fridayâ€ ™ s last - minute negotiations , made clear at a press conference earlier on Monday that he expected the Senateâ€ ™ s bill to be put to a vote .
â€œI would hope and expect that we will have a vote , â€ � this week , he said .
The White House also appears to be in a confident mood .
â€œThe president certainly was disappointed to have to sign that one week extension , â€ � said Obamaâ€ ™ s press secretary Josh Earnest .
â€œThe fact that the president had to sign a seven - day funding bill does represent an abject failure of the leadership of the House.â€ �
There is speculation that Boehner plans to rely on obscure procedural rules to limit the embarrassment of an expected climbdown , effectively standing by while Democrats exploit a rarely - used procedure to force the vote without the speakerâ€ ™ s explicit consent .
But regardless of how Boehner packages it , a House vote on a standalone funding bill that would keep the DHS funded for six months and â€ “ and leave Obamaâ€ ™ s immigration plans unscathed â€ “ would represent yet another strategic defeat for the conservative flank of the GOP .
Weeks of bitter confrontations with Democrats and moderate Republicans will have yielded no discernible gains for conservatives â€ “ except , perhaps , for the display of power that have proven they can still exert over the embattled speaker of the House ."
2015-03-02,"An undaunted Binyamin Netanyahu has defended his decision to defy the White House and accept an invitation from Republican leader John Boehner to address Congress on Tuesday on the risks of a nuclear deal with Iran .
Though he acknowledged his speech may have been interpreted as a partisan intervention in US politics , the Israeli prime minister insisted it was a necessary step , given his fears that the international talks would fail to adequately contain Tehranâ€ ™ s nuclear potential .
â€œThe days when the Jewish people are passive in the face of threats to annihilate us , those days are over , â€ �
he told an audience of around 16,000 people at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( Aipac ) annual policy conference in Washington .
â€œToday , we are no longer silent ; today , we have a voice .
Tomorrow , as prime minister of the one and only Jewish state , I plan to use that voice , â€ � he added in what was effectively a warm - up speech before Tuesdayâ€ ™ s appearance before a joint meeting of Congress .
The speech , which comes just two weeks before a hotly contested election in which Netanyahu is seeking a third term in office , has prompted one of the worst crises in relations between Israel and the US .
By accepting an invitation from the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , John Boehner , the prime minister infuriated the White House , which was not consulted beforehand .
Both Netanyahu and the US ambassador to the UN , Samantha Power , who addressed Aipac earlier on Monday , insisted that the US - Israeli relationship would survive their disagreement over how to handle the threat of Iran developing nuclear weapons .
â€œThe last thing that I would want is for Israel to become a partisan issue , and I regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that , â€ � said Netanyahu .
â€œMy speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the esteemed office he holds , â€ � he added .
Power stressed her role as covering â€œIsraelâ€ ™ s backâ€ � at the United Nations , saying â€œthe US relationship with Israel transcends politics and it always will.â€ �
But the tensions were never far from the surface and Power , who was added to the itinerary at the last minute , was introduced by Aipac officials who asked that the audience â€œtreat speakers as guests in our homeâ€ � .
â€œDebating the most effective policy both within our respective democracies and among partners is more than useful , it is a necessary part of arriving at informed decisions , â€ �
she said .
â€œPoliticising that process is not .
The stakes are too high for that.â€ � More challenging still will be an appearance by US national security adviser Susan Rice later on Monday evening , who has been accused by Israel of backing a deal that would only temporarily prevent Iran from developing weapons technology .
â€œThere will never be a sunset on Americaâ€ ™ s commitment to Israelâ€ ™ s security , â€ � insisted Power , in anticipation of a line expected to feature heavily in Netanyahuâ€ ™ s critique of the talks on Tuesday but vehemently rejected by the White House .
In an otherwise largely glowing speech on the special relationship between the two countries , Power also reminded her audience of earlier clashes between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the stalled Palestinian peace process .
â€œAs successive US administrations have made clear for decades , Israeli settlement activity damages the prospects for peace ; nor will one - sided actions in international bodies or accession to international treaties , such as actions against Israel , at the International Criminal Court help us get to a negotiated solution , â€ �
she said .
But Netanyahu was emphatic that his government was a unique ally to Washington during times of growing regional tension .
â€œAs our region descends into medieval barbarism , Israel is the one that upholds these values common to us and to you , â€ � he said .
â€œIn a dark , and savage , and desperate Middle East , Israel is a beacon of humanity , of light and of hope.â€ �
And in hits of the emotional appeal likely to characterise Tuesdayâ€ ™ s speech , the prime minister implied that this special relationship should give it a special role in the debate .
â€œAmerica and Israel are more than friends .
Weâ€
™ re like a family , â€ � he said ."
2015-03-03,"A protracted round of brinkmanship in Washington DC over immigration has ended with John Boehner blinking .
The speaker of the House announced on Tuesday that he would allow a vote on a â€œcleanâ€ � funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) .
The announcement , which came a little over an hour before the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , was scheduled to address a joint session of Congress , marks the end of a months - long standoff over funding the department .
Republicans had long sought to use DHS funding as leverage to try to overturn the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s controversial 2014 executive order , which allowed 5 million undocumented migrants to remain in the United States , as well as a 2012 executive order which applied to so - called Dreamers , a subgroup of undocumented migrants who were brought to the US while they were underage and have clean criminal records .
Conservatives in the GOP originally wanted to use a potential shutdown of the entire government as leverage to overturn the executive order .
However , a December compromise on the â€œCromnibusâ€ � , an overarching budget bill , lowered the stakes .
Most of the government would be funded for the entire year but funding for DHS would be continued for 60 days , a strategy that would avoid the political fallout of an entire government shutdown .
The strategy failed .
After nearly a month of legislative ping - pong , which included a temporary , one - week extension of DHS funding , Boehner has finally yielded .
In remarks to his caucus , Boehner said he didnâ€ ™ t want to risk a DHS shutdown , which he said â€œwasnâ€ ™ t an optionâ€ � with the current level of threats to national security .
He also didnâ€ ™ t think a short - term extension would be viable , particularly after a number of Republicans rebelled on a three - week extension of funding on Friday .
The House speaker had been the last hope of immigration hawks who hoped to go on the offensive against the White House now that the GOP has majorities in both chambers of Congress after the Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , acquiesced on a clean DHS bill which the upper chamber passed last week .
Boehner maintained , though , that Republicans were still in a strong position to thwart Obamaâ€ ™ s executive order because of ongoing litigation in federal court after a district court judge in Texas issued a preliminary injunction blocking the executive orderâ€ ™ s implementation in mid - February .
However , most legal observers expect the fifth circuit court of appeals in New Orleans to overturn the lower courtâ€ ™ s decision and allow the executive order to go into effect ."
2015-03-03,"The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) will remain funded after months of drama as House Republicans folded on the issue of taking combative steps to overturn Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive order on immigration .
The House passed a so - called â€œcleanâ€ � funding bill on Tuesday , keeping the lights on at DHS through September .
The bill passed , 257 - 167 , as 75 Republicans â€ “ including a rare vote from the House speaker , John Boehner â€ “ joined with all 182 Democrats to avert a shutdown .

Itâ€ ™ s about restoring the power of Congress to make law .
Todayâ€ ™ s vote will embolden this president and future presidents to use executive action when they canâ€ ™ t get what they want from Congress.â€

In contrast , Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois , one of the most prominent advocates for immigration reform on Capitol Hill , crowed in a statement the vote was â€œa huge victory for the United States and for American familiesâ€

â€œI am glad we have stopped playing these dangerous budget and shutdown games for the time being , â€ � he said ."
2015-03-04,"Barack Obama signed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) through October on Wednesday afternoon , officially ending a political crisis that dominated Washington in the first two months of 2015 .
Obama signed the legislation , HR 240 , just one day after it was passed by the House of Representatives in a fractious vote that saw a majority of House Republicans rebel against Speaker John Boehner .
DHS funding had been controversial for months in the wake of Obamaâ€ ™ s November 2014 executive order that allowed up to 5 million undocumented migrants to remain in the United States indefinitely .
Conservatives saw funding for the department as an important lever to try to thwart what they saw as executive overreach and force Obama to reverse himself on one of the boldest actions of his second term .
They repeatedly insisted that they would only pass a DHS funding bill that contained a provision overturning the executive orders .
In contrast , Democrats claimed that this was â€œblackmailâ€ � and refused to support any bill that had this language .
Eventually though , Republicans blinked and a â€œcleanâ€ �
DHS funding bill finally passed Congress .
By signing the bill , Obama ends this chapter in his latest showdown with Congress over immigration and government funding .
But , with another major budget fight looming for the next fiscal year as well as various other critical Capitol Hill deadlines coming up , including the renewal of important aspects of Medicare and the Patriot Act , it does not signal the beginning of a new comity .
Instead , it merely formalizes the end of the most recent battle in the war between the White House and congressional Republicans ."
2015-03-17,"The Republican House speaker , John Boehner , urged Hillary Clinton to hand over all her emails to a neutral third party on Tuesday .
In his weekly press conference , Boehner said â€œthe way forward is for [ Clinton ] to turn over all the emailsâ€ � .
A â€œneutral third partyâ€ � would have to â€œmake a decision about what documents are personal and what are public recordsâ€
� , he said .
Boehnerâ€ ™ s statements come amid weeks of controversy over the revelation that Clinton used a personal email account , HDR22@clintonemail.com , while serving as US secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 .
This account was housed on a private server that belonged to Clinton .
At a press conference at the United Nations last week , Clinton further revealed that she deleted 30,000 emails that she deemed personal .
Her use of this account was first discovered by the House select committee on Benghazi in 2014 and first publicly reported by the New York Times earlier this month .
Boehner further revealed on Tuesday that the congressional investigation into Clintonâ€ ™ s private email accounts would continue along two separate tracks .
He said â€œthe Benghazi committee is focused on getting facts with regard to Benghaziâ€ � and will continue its investigation of the 11 September 2012 terrorist attack on the US consulate that killed four people , including Ambassador Chris Stevens .
However , Boehner added that the House government reform and oversight committee â€œhas worked on federal open records law and is continuing their workâ€ � on this issue and that there would be â€œno changes with these documentsâ€ � .
With Clinton expected to launch her presidential campaign in April , these investigations are likely to continue through the next two years and loom over her second run for the White House .
The increased scrutiny has taken an impact on Clintonâ€ ™ s standing .
A recent poll showed the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s favorability ratings declining in the aftermath of the scandal , which shows signs of developing in new directions .
On Monday , the State Department spokeswoman , Jen Psaki , was unable to answer a question from Matt Lee of the Associated Press about whether Clinton signed â€œa separation formâ€

2015-03-26,"In an act of bipartisanship seldom witnessed in the halls of Congress , the US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that would permanently replace the formula for reimbursing doctors who treat Medicare patients .
The so - called â€œdoc fixâ€ � bill sailed to final passage with a vote of 392 - 37 , a shocking margin in the context of institutional gridlock that has defined Washington this millennium .
The deal was crafted by the House speaker , John Boehner , and House minority leader , Nancy Pelosi , opponents who urged their counterparts in the Senate to â€œexpeditiouslyâ€ � pass the legislation .
The bill puts an end to the near - annual exercise that has plagued Congress for more than a decade â€ “ a ritual that originated with a 1997 law that sought to rein in Medicare spending by linking pay increases for providers to economic growth .
But faced with rising healthcare costs and potentially drastic pay cuts to doctors , Congress responded by issuing temporary patches to the formula rather than imposing the fee limits .
Meanwhile , a permanent fix evaded lawmakers who have mostly used entitlement reform to score political points .
The House - passed bill offers a rare breakthrough by repealing the â€œsustainable growth
rateâ€ � formula for Medicare reimbursements with incremental 0.5 % pay increases for doctors each year through 2019 .
The bill , Pelosi said , represents a way to â€œremove this fight from the calendar in a way that is transformative and will lower cost for Medicareâ€ � , while Boehner heralded it as a â€œtrue bipartisan agreementâ€ � .
â€œThis will be the first real entitlement reform that weâ€ ™ ve seen in nearly two decades , and thatâ€ ™ s a big win for the American people , â€ �
Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill .
The White House threw its support behind the bill , which also includes two years of funding for a government program that provides children from low - income families with health insurance .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve got my pen ready to sign a good , bipartisan bill â€ “ which would be really exciting ,
â€ �
Barack Obama said on Wednesday .
â€œI love when Congress passes bipartisan bills that I can sign .
Itâ€ ™ s very encouraging.â€
�
The bill now heads to the Senate , which is not expected to act until Congress returns from a two - week Easter recess .
Senate Democrats were initially skeptical of what they perceived as anti - abortion language in the package , but some of those concerns have since been allayed by the strong show of support for the bill among House Democrats , aides said .
Pelosiâ€ ™ s office also ensured the bill made clear that there would be no new restrictions on reproductive rights , maintaining only the routine language that prohibits the use of taxpayer funds on abortions .
Given the large vote in the House and backing from the White House , Senate aides said they expect no significant hurdles when they take up the bill ."
2015-03-29,"Iran has â€œno intentionâ€ � of keeping its word on an agreement being negotiated in Switzerland over its nuclear programme , House speaker John Boehner said on Sunday .
The top Republicanâ€ ™ s comments came as negotiations in Lausanne approached the 31 March deadline for the drafting of a framework for a deal , under intense criticism from Israelâ€ ™ s prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu .
Speaking on CNN , Boehner said he had serious doubts about the talks .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got a regime
thatâ€ ™ s never quite kept their word about anything , â€ �
he said .
â€œI
just donâ€
™ t understand why we would sign an agreement with a group of people who have no intention of keeping their word.â€
�
If there was no agreement , Boehner said he would move â€œveryâ€
� quickly to impose new sanctions on Iran .
â€œThe sanctions are going to come and they are going to come quickly , â€ � he said .
Boehner deepened a rift with President Barack Obama when he invited Netanyahu to address Congress earlier this month without first informing the White House .
The invite strained Obamaâ€ ™ s already awkward relationship with the Israeli premier .
â€œI think the animosity exhibited by this administration toward the prime minister of Israel is reprehensible , â€ � said Boehner .
â€œAnd I think the pressure they have put on him over the past four or five years frankly pushed him to the point where he had to speak up.â€
�
Boehner said Netanyahu had clearly highlighted the threat he said
Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme represents , â€œnot only to the Middle East but to the rest of the worldâ€ � .
Netanyahu denounced the talks once again on Sunday .
â€œI am deeply troubled by the emerging agreement with Iran in the nuclear talks , â€ � he said at the start of a cabinet meeting .
â€œThe agreement confirms all of our fears and even worse.â€ �
Boehner said : â€œThe president doesnâ€ ™ t want to talk about [ Iran ] .
Doesnâ€
™ t want to talk about the fact that he has no strategy to deal with it .
When you begin to see all these leaks that presumably came out of the White House about what the Iranian deal was going to be , there is a lot of concern in Congress on a bipartisan basis.â€ �"
2015-03-30,"Nothing sums up the warped foreign policy fantasy world in which Republicans live more than when House Speaker John Boehner recently called Obama an â€œanti - war presidentâ€ � under which America â€œis sitting on the sidelinesâ€ � in the increasingly chaotic Middle East .
If Obama is an anti - war president , heâ€ ™ s the worst anti - war president in history .
In the last six years , the Obama administration has bombed seven countries in the Middle East alone and armed countless more with tens of billions in dollars in weapons .
But thatâ€ ™ s apparently not enough for Republicans .
As the Isis war continues to expand and Yemen descends into civil war , everyone is still demanding more : If only we bombed the region a little bit harder , then theyâ€ ™ ll submit .
In between publishing a new rash of overt sociopathic â€œBomb
Iranâ€ � op - eds
, Republicans and neocons are circulating a new talking point : Obama doesnâ€ ™ t have a â€œcoherentâ€ � or â€œunifyingâ€ � strategy in the Middle East .
But you canâ€ ™ t have a one - size - fits - all strategy in an entire region that is almost incomprehensibly complex â€ “ which is why no one , including the Republicans criticizing Obama , actually has an answer for what that strategy should be .
Itâ€ ™ s clear that this new talking point is little more than thinly veiled code for weâ€ ™ re not killing enough Muslims or invading enough countries .
Nobody will say that they want US troops on the ground to fight Isis , of course , since public support for such action is crumbling .
But as the Council on Foreign Relationsâ€ ™ Douglas Dillon Fellow Micah Zenko tweeted recently , â€œIf 30 years of US as military hegemon in the Middle East resulted in the region today , why would more suddenly stabilize things?â€
�
No one seems to be willing to face the stark fact that US involvement is as much the cause of the instability as it is the alleged solution .
Those clamoring for more war are detached from reality : the US is already escalating â€ “ not pulling back â€ “ its involvement across the Middle East .
In Afghanistan , the president has quietly delayed pulling US troops out of Afghanistan by the end of the year
so they can continue special forces raids and drone strikes , despite loudly celebrating the supposed â€œendâ€ � of combat operations during the State of the Union in January .
In Iraq , US forces escalated its airstrikes in the so - called battle to re - take Tikrit , which the New York Times editorial board decried as a folly , but received scant scrutiny elsewhere .
The Pentagon also confirmed last week that they expect the Isis war to last â€œ3 + years.â€ �
And if you think the United States is sitting on the sidelines in Yemen just because itâ€ ™ s not US planes physically launching the missiles ( yet ) , you should have your head examined .
The US has given Saudi Arabia an astronomical $ 90bn in military equipment and weapons over the past four years and , as the Washington Post reported , it will play a â€œhugeâ€ � role in any fighting .
US drones are also still patrolling Yemeni skies and even helping Saudi Arabia â€œdecide what and where to bombâ€ � , according to the Wall Street Journal .
What would his critics have Obama do in Yemen , for example ?
He had already authorized dozens of drones strikes over the years ( which backfired and many people think strengthened al - Qaida ) .
He gave the Yemeni government $ 500mn in heavy weaponry and military gear , all of which is now completely unaccounted for and likely in the hands of US enemies .
This is Americaâ€ ™ s modus operandi in the Middle East : give its friends a ton of weapons and watch the weapons fall into enemy hands one way or another .
In Afghanistan , the US gave the Afghanistan government nearly 500,000 weapons that are now unaccounted for ( and that was a couple years ago ) .
In Libya , shipments of arms reportedly sent by the CIA to Libyan rebels in 2011 via the Qataris ended up , in many cases , in the hands of Islamic militants , as the New York Times reported .
Neither stopped the Obama administration from arming rebels in Syria , where many of the weapons promptly fell into enemy hands as well .
Virtually every month in Iraq , another large cache of US weapons ends up being commandeered by Isis or al - Qaida , either from Iraqi soldiers abandoning all the arms the US has given them over the past decade or from US air drops that land in enemy hands , as we saw in September , October , November , February , and a couple times in March .
Isis has commandeered so many US weapons that thereâ€ ™ s even a Buzzfeed photo listicle about it .
Photographer Gregg Carlstrom succinctly summed it up last week as Saudi Arabia started to drop bombs on Yemen : â€œUS praises US ally for bombing US - equipped militia aligned with US foe who is partnering with US to fight another US - equipped militia.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ d be nice if the public debate over Americaâ€ ™ s role in the Middle East even acknowledged our culpability for some of the problems in the region , rather than steamroll over it on the way to war in yet another country ."
2015-04-03,"Republican leaders and presidential contenders reacted to what Barack Obama called a â€œhistoric agreementâ€ � with Iran over its nuclear program by alternately denouncing the deal and jostling to have a say in it .
John Boehner , the House speaker , called the deal â€œan alarming departure from the White Houseâ€ ™ s initial goalsâ€ � and insisted that Congress â€œbe allowed to fully review the details of any agreement before any sanctions are liftedâ€ � .
The co - leader of congressional Republicans also reiterated his belief that Iran could not be trusted .
â€œIt would be naive to suggest the Iranian regime will not continue to use its nuclear program , and any economic relief , to further destabilize the region , â€ � Boehner said in a statement .
Boehner recently returned from a visit to Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu , who convened security officials on Friday after calling Obama to tell him a deal would â€œthreaten Israelâ€ ™ s
existenceâ€ � .
Senator Bob Corker , the chairman of the foreign relations committee , said he would press forward on a bill that would give Congress power to alter the deal .
â€œIf a final agreement is reached , the American people , through their elected representatives , must have the opportunity to weigh in to ensure the deal truly can eliminate the threat of Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear program and hold the regime accountable , â€ �
he said in a statement .
Corkerâ€ ™ s committee will prepare the bill for a vote on 14 April , giving Congress ample time to pass it before the 30 June deadline for a final deal with Iran .
Obama has threatened to veto such legislation should it reach his desk .
Boehner , Corker and Senate veterans such as Lindsey Graham received the deal cautiously , neither condemning it nor accepting it .
Instead they demanded to know more details .
â€œThe impacts of a bad deal with Iran are unimaginable to our own national security , the region as a whole , and our allies , â€ � Graham said in a statement .
â€œWe simply can not take President Obamaâ€ ™ s word that it is this or war.â€ � Other Republicans , including several de facto presidential candidates , were less circumspect .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who has raised millions of dollars in his nascent but as - yet - unofficial presidential campaign , denounced the deal .
â€œThese negotiations began , by President Obamaâ€ ™ s own admission , as an effort to deny Iran nuclear capabilities , but instead will only legitimize those activities , â€ � Bush said .
â€œI can not stand behind such a flawed agreement.â€ � Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , also on the fundraising trail , wrote on Twitter : â€œObamaâ€ ™ s dangerous deal with Iran rewards an enemy , undermines our allies and threatens our safety.â€ � Senator Marco Rubio called the deal â€œvery troublingâ€ � and said the White House had failed to curb Iran in the Middle East .
â€œThis attempt to spin diplomatic failure as a success is just the latest example of this administrationâ€ ™ s farcical approach to Iran , â€ �
he said .
Texas senator Ted Cruz , the only official candidate in the race , demanded the president let Congress put its fingerprints on a deal .
â€œThe very first step for any deal , good or bad , should be submitting it to Congress , and the president making the case both to Congress and to the American people why this advances the national security interests of the United States , â€ � he said .
Freshman senator Tom Cotton , the author of a controversial to Iranian leaders that was criticized as an overreach of Republicansâ€ ™ powers , promised to â€œwork with [ his ] colleagues in the Senate to protect America from this very dangerous proposalâ€ � .
Democrats also took the announcement warily , despite the presidentâ€ ™ s appeal on Thursday to give diplomacy a chance .
Senate minority leader Harry Reid said â€œnow is the time for thoughtful considerationâ€ � and called for all parties to â€œtake a deep breath , examine the details and give this critically important process time to play outâ€ � .
Likely presidential candidate and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton expressed tentative optimism but repeated Congressâ€ ™ s refrain about details .
â€œGetting the rest of the way to a final deal by June wonâ€ ™ t be easy , but it is absolutely crucial ,
â€ � she said .
â€œI
know well that the devil is always in the details in this kind of negotiation.â€
� Bob Menendez , a Senate Democrat who co - sponsored Corkerâ€ ™ s bill , called for a say in the deal : â€œIf diplomats can negotiate for two years on this issue , then certainly Congress is entitled to a review period of an agreement that will fundamentally alter our relationship with Iran.â€ �
Also on Thursday , Menendez pleaded not guilty to federal corruption charges ."
2015-09-15,"Congress is running out of time to agree on a spending plan that keeps the government open , as Republican leaders attempt to defuse the threat of another shutdown â€ “ this one over Planned Parenthood .
Dozens of conservatives in the House and Senate have already pledged not to vote for a spending bill that includes money for Planned Parenthood .
But both House speaker John Boehner and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell have rejected such proposals , worried that moderate and independent voters may blame the Republican party for a government shutdown .
Republican leadership is seeking to decouple the effort to defund Planned Parenthood from the spending bill , which must be passed by the end of the month or risk a second shutdown in two years .
In an effort to pacify the conservative caucus , House Republicans are expected to vote later this week on two abortion - related bills .
But it remains an open question whether the partyâ€ ™ s most conservative members will stage a revolt against a spending bill that includes money for Planned Parenthood .
McConnell , a Republican from Kentucky , has warned that linking the two is an â€œexercise in futilityâ€ � as any spending bill that strips funding from Planned Parenthood would be met with a presidential veto .
â€œShutting down the government , it doesnâ€ ™ t defund Planned Parenthood any more than shutting down the government two years ago would have defunded Obamacare ,
â€ �
McConnell told Politico in an interview last week , referring to the 2013 government shutdown .
One bill expected to go to a vote in the House to appease conservatives would strip federal funds from any Planned Parenthood affiliate that provides abortion services to women .
The second would add criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to provide medical care to a baby that survives an abortion attempt .
â€œNow that the false claims against Planned Parenthood have fallen apart , politicians are heartlessly scrambling to attack womenâ€ ™ s access to health care however they can .
Itâ€ ™ s clear
those behind these attacks have always had a clear agenda : to ban abortion , and cut millions of women and men across the country from necessary reproductive health care ,
â€ � the organization said in response to the House votes .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re continuing to push that agenda no matter how many they hurt in the process.â€ �
Neither bill stands much of a chance in the Senate , where it has been reported that McConnell is considering scheduling a vote on a 20-week abortion ban as a way to placate the conservative caucus .
Planned Parenthood has come under fire for a series of undercover videos released earlier this summer that showed employees discussing fetal tissue donation .
The group behind the heavily edited videos has alleged Planned Parenthood illegally profited from the sale of fetal tissue , a claim that the organization vehemently denies and which multiple investigations could not substantiate .
Yet the videos riled conservatives and triggered congressional investigations .
The group released yet another video Tuesday with footage of comments by Planned Parenthood staff .
Planned Parenthood offers a range of reproductive health services , but Republicans are obsessed with only one : abortion .
Even so , pulling federal funding from Planned Parenthood would not necessarily stop the organization from providing women with abortions , which represent just a small fraction - 3 % - of the services it provides to women nationwide .
Planned Parenthood receives about $ 500 m per year in government funding , mostly through Medicaid and grants , and none of which can be used to provide abortion services .
Rather , the funds mostly go toward subsidizing cancer screenings , contraceptives and other womenâ€ ™ s health and family planning services .
National polling has found that defunding the organization would be unpopular , and a government shutdown over it even more so .
A CNN / ORC poll poll released on Monday found that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe it is more important for Congress to approve a spending bill and avoid a shutdown , compared with Americans who believe itâ€ ™ s more important for Congress to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood at any cost .
Among Republican presidential contenders , Texas senator Ted Cruz has pushed a plan that could trigger a government shutdown .
And Kentucky senator Rand Paul has said he would defund Planned Parenthood â€œat all costsâ€ � but stopped short of saying heâ€ ™ d shut down the government in the process .
Ohio governor and Republican candidate John Kasich , by contrast , agreed with Republican leaders that shutting down the government was futile , because when it reopened , the organization would resume receiving its funds .
â€œWell , if you shut down the government , the question is , will you defund ( Planned Parenthood ) ?
I think the answer is no
, â€ �
Kasich said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Sunday .
He added : â€œThe American people will say : â€˜What are you doing?â€ ™ â€ �"
2015-09-25,"John Boehner , the speaker of the House of Representatives , will resign from Congress next month , he announced on Friday , in a stunning move that follows intense pressure from conservatives in the House .
The top Republican on Capitol Hill announced his resignation at a party meeting on Friday morning and later confirmed in a statement that he will step down on 30 October .
It brings to a close a career spanning nearly three decades , and a four - year speakership that has been marked by Republican infighting following the partyâ€ ™ s taking control of the chamber in 2011 .
While addressing the media on Friday afternoon , a tearful Boehner cast his decision as one designed to protect the institution of Congress .
â€œIâ€ ™ m doing this today for the right reasons , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œAnd the right things will happen as a result.â€ � Boehner , 65 , has long been under intense pressure from House conservatives , who have repeatedly threatened to stage a coup against him and expressed dissatisfaction with his leadership in high - profile fights on Capitol Hill .
Boehner has survived many rebellions from the hard - right wing of his party over the years , notably over bipartisan deals that raised taxes in 2012 and resolved a government shutdown in 2013 .
House conservatives , many of them members of the so - called Freedom Caucus , were again moving against Boehner in recent weeks amid a battle over federal funding for the womenâ€ ™ s health organization Planned Parenthood .
The chamberâ€ ™ s right flank is pushing an effort to strip funding for the agency from a must - pass bill to fund the government , a strategy that would all but guarantee another government shutdown .
Planned Parenthood has long been targeted by Republicans , but their efforts have intensified after the release of secretly recorded videos that raised questions about its handling of fetal tissue provided to scientific researchers .
Aides to Boehner said the speaker ultimately made a decision to step aside â€œfor the good of the Republican Conference and the institutionâ€ � .
While the news of Boehnerâ€ ™ s departure sent immediate shockwaves through Washington , the Ohio Republican said he initially planned to resign at the end of last year but stayed on â€œto provide continuityâ€ � after the stunning defeat of then House majority leader Eric Cantor in his 2014 primary election .
As news of his resignation broke , Boehner was praised by visibly shocked leaders in both parties .
â€œJohn Boehnerâ€ ™ s a good man .
He is a patriot .
He cares deeply about the House â€ ¦ his constituents , and America , â€ � Barack Obama said at a press conference , moments after speaking to Boehner on the phone .
â€œHe has always conducted himself with courtesy and civility with me .
He has kept his word when he has made a commitment.â€ � Aides and members of Congress in the room said Boehner received a standing ovation during the meeting at which he announced his resignation .
As speculation immediately spread over who would succeed Boehner , a number of influential Republicans took their names out of the mix .
Wisconsin representative Paul Ryan , the chairman of the powerful House ways and means committee , told reporters he would not seek the job .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to be speaker , â€ � Ryan said .
North Carolina representative Mark Meadows , a conservative who in July filed a motion to remove Boehner as speaker , also ruled out a run .
Kevin McCarthy of California , the House majority leader , is next in line as speaker but would have to secure the votes of his caucus in a formal leadership election .
The House speaker is second in line for the presidency after the vice - president and one of the most powerful figures in Washington .
Boehner has thus shaped his partyâ€ ™ s strategy for passing legislation , scheduled congressional business and been Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s main foil on the Hill .
Boehner has faced repeated challenges to his leadership from the right wing of his caucus since ascending to the top post in the House in 2011 .
Predictions of Boehnerâ€ ™ s political demise abounded during the partial government shutdown of October 2013 , which resulted from a showdown between hard - right Republicans who sought to deny funding for the presidentâ€ ™ s healthcare policy and Obama , who refused to sign spending legislation that carved the policy up .
The eventual deal that Boehner and Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader in the Senate , negotiated with Obama failed to achieve Republican demands .
On Friday at the Values Voter Summit , an annual conclave of social conservatives in Washington , the room erupted in a standing ovation when the news was announced on stage by Senator Marco Rubio .
Rubio seemed to embrace the news in his speech , saying : â€œThe time has come to turn the page.â€ �
Jim Bridenstine , a representative from Oklahoma , seemed to give credit for Boehnerâ€ ™ s resignation to Texas senator and 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz .
â€œThe good news is we are going to get new leadership , â€ � Bridenstine said .
â€œI want to share with you why that is happening .
That is happening because there is a newly elected senator that showed up articulating principles of the GOP platform.â€ � Cruz has a famously contentious relationship with Boehner ,
who last month at a closed - door fundraiser referred to the Texas senator as â€œa jackassâ€ � .
Since his arrival on Capitol Hill in 2013 , Cruz has helped orchestrate a number of rebellions against Boehner â€ “ most notably the shutdown over the presidentâ€ ™ s healthcare law .
In what were regarded as unprecedented moves by a member of the Senate , Cruz also routinely gathered House conservatives to plot strategies at odds with the will of Boehner and his leadership team .
Moderate Republicans were dismayed by what they said was a defeat for sensible voices within the party .
â€œTo me , this is a victory of the crazies , â€ �
New York representative Peter King told reporters on Capitol Hill .
Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic leader in the House and a close friend of Boehnerâ€ ™ s , said his departure was â€œseismicâ€ � .
â€œThe resignation of the speaker is a stark indication of the disarray of the House Republicans , â€ � she said .
The shock announcement came a day after a highlight of Boehnerâ€ ™ s career , when Pope Francis addressed Congress at Boehnerâ€ ™ s invitation .
The speaker , a former altar boy , wept during the speech and later called it â€œa blessing for us allâ€ � .
On Friday , the speaker broke down while recalling his meeting with Pope Francis , an encounter that aides said moved Boehner closer to his decision to announce his resignation the following day .
â€œThe Pope puts his arm around me and says , â€˜Please pray for me , â€ ™ â€ � Boehner , a devout Catholic , said .
â€œWho am I to pray for the Pope ?
But I did.â€ �
He added : â€œI woke up and said I my prayers â€
¦
and I decided , todayâ€ ™ s the day Iâ€ ™ m going to do this , â€ � Boehner said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s as simple as that.â€ �
He nonetheless maintained that his departure was rooted in a desire to bring House Republicans together .
â€œWhen youâ€ ™ re the Speaker of the House , your No 1 responsibility is to the institution , â€ � Boehner said , adding that a potential vote by conservatives to remove him from the post would tarnish that commitment .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to put my colleagues through this â€ ¦ for what?â€ �
While Boehner will not participate in the vote on his successor , he said McCarthy â€œwould make an excellent speakerâ€ � .
â€œHis number one responsibility is to protect the institution , â€ � he added .
Minutes before the announcement , Boehner tweeted pictures of the popeâ€ ™ s Washington visit with the caption : â€œWhat a day.â€ � Boehner , first elected to Congress from his south - west Ohio district in 1990 , had a turbulent career before becoming speaker .
He joined the Republican congressional leadership in 1994 , after the party took control of Congress for the first time in 50 years .
Four years later , after the GOP lost seats in midterm elections and Boehner participated in a failed coup against then speaker Newt Gingrich , he was ousted .
Boehner became chair of the House education and workforce committee , a position in which he worked with Senator Ted Kennedy to author the landmark No Child Left Behind bill , and worked in a bipartisan manner with another Democrat , his counterpart George Miller of California .
He returned to leadership in 2006 , winning an election to be the No2 Republican in the House .
A year later , after Democrats took control of Congress , he moved up to become his partyâ€ ™ s leader .

2015-09-26,"When news broke of House speaker John Boehnerâ€ ™ s resignation at a gathering of social conservatives on Friday , the room filled with hundreds of grassroots activists immediately erupted into cheers and a standing ovation .
The moment was emblematic of a years - long struggle for the soul of the Republican party , a high - stakes battle that has publicly unfolded in often ugly and always dramatic fashion .
As the highest - ranking Republican in Washington , Boehner has spent the greater part of the last four years as the face of that turmoil and , by his own admission , decided to step aside in part to restore a sense of calm .
But even as conservative hardliners sought to take credit for Boehnerâ€ ™ s departure , the question of whether the shocking event truly marked a turning point for the direction of the Republican party remained unclear â€ “ and one that will likely be determined by the race for president .
â€œThe presidential election is ultimately going to be arbiter of how this all lands â€ “
either we win this national election or we donâ€ ™ t , â€ � said Rory Cooper , who served as an aide to former House majority leader Eric Cantor until his ouster from Congress in 2014 .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t just be a midterm election party , we have to be a party that can win back the White House.â€ �
Among Republicans , the race for the highest office in the United States has already been shaped by the rise of outsiders â€ “ led by Donald Trump â€ “ who have made a name for themselves by attacking party leaders in Washington .
More mainstream Republican candidates have either struggled to gain traction early on , or looked to adopt a tone more suitable to the anti - establishment wave gripping the primary contest .
It was thus no surprise that several presidential contenders wasted no time in seizing on Boehnerâ€ ™ s announcement at Fridayâ€ ™ s
conservative confab in Washington , an annual meeting known as the Values Voter Summit , as a sign that it was time to usher in new leadership at every level .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not here to bash anyone , but the time has come to turn the page
, â€ � said Florida senator Marco Rubio , who was the one to inform the crowd of Boehnerâ€ ™ s resignation .
â€œIt is time to turn the page and allow a new generation of leaders.â€ �
Mike Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor , suggested Republican leaders in Congress had it coming after failing to stop Barack Obama from implementing key pieces of his agenda .
â€œI
just know when people sent them here , they didnâ€
™ t send them to give the president more power on Obamacare , immigration and even trade and certainly not the Iranian deal , â€ � he said .
â€œThose things were very much above the surface
â€
“
we saw them all
and it frustrated the heck out of most of us who had gone out there and helped to get most of those guys elected.â€
�
And Texas senator Ted Cruz , who has developed a reputation as a rabble rouser in Congress and frequently lobbied Boehnerâ€ ™ s own members against him , openly gloated .
â€œYou want to know how much each of you terrify
Washington?â€
�
Cruz asked the audience .
â€œYesterday , John Boehner was speaker of the House .
Yâ€ ™ all come to town and somehow that changes.â€ � Candidates like Cruz helped intensify pressure on Boehner in recent weeks over the battle that ultimately led the speaker to sacrifice himself : funding for the womenâ€ ™ s health organization Planned Parenthood .
Cruz has led conservative calls to defund the agency as part of a must - pass bill to fund the government , after controversy erupted over heavily edited videos , filmed in secret by anti - abortion activists , that showed Planned Parenthood employees discussing the use of fetal tissue in medical research .
The tactic would all but guarantee a government shutdown , a path Boehner did not want to revisit after Republicans were blamed when the federal government closed in 2013 amid an impasse over funding for the presidentâ€ ™ s health care law .
The posturing among candidates was echoed by the views of attendees at the Values Voter summit , who wished Boehner good riddance .
â€œI was glad to hear he was out of there .
Heâ€
™ s been lazy at best and not trying for the conservative goals , â€ � said Tristan Meisner of Hamilton , Virginia .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a good thing .
I donâ€
™ t think heâ€ ™ s been forceful enough .
Heâ€ ™ s not a conservative , â€ � said Sandra Gibb , of Kansas City , Missouri .
â€œWe have the House majority â€ “ and nothing is happening .
They should have repealed Obamacare .
This Iran deal is terrible .
They havenâ€ ™ t done anything.â€ � National party officials have remained confident that the anti - Washington sentiment will not be enough to propel the likes of Cruz , Trump or retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to the Republican nomination .
But their impact on the dialogue has been both palpable and potentially damaging to the partyâ€ ™ s general election chances , as candidates risk alienating minorities , women and young voters on issues like immigration and womenâ€ ™ s health .
And aides suggested on Friday that the presidential race helped to elevate the Planned Parenthood fight in a way that distinguished it from previous showdowns in which Republican leadership ultimately prevailed , despite revolts from conservative hardliners that pushed them to the edge .
Boehnerâ€ ™ s resignation will also shake up Republican leadership in the House , leaving it to the next speaker to stabilize the tone in Washington and prevent further rebellions that could carry with them consequences for the partyâ€ ™ s chances in 2016 .
House majority leader Kevin McCarthy , another moderate voice within the party , is a strong favorite to succeed Boehner â€ “ although conservatives said Friday they will look to challenge him with a candidate of their own .
What it would take to satisfy the right flank was anyoneâ€ ™ s guess .
â€œThe rank - and - file John Boehner from his pre - leadership days â€ “ heâ€
™ d be the guy his current opponents would want to be speaker , â€ � Cooper said .
â€œHe was 100 % pro - life , 100 % pro - NRA , a fiscal and budget hawk .
Heâ€ ™ d be their guy .
Heâ€
™ s always been a true conservative.â€ �
New York representative Peter King sounded a similar alarm with respect to the far - right members of the caucus , whom he referred to as â€œcraziesâ€ � .
â€œI think whoever runs for speaker should make it clear that heâ€ ™ s not going to give in to these people .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to appease them ,
â€ �
King said on CNN .
â€œThe time for appeasement is over.â€ �

2015-09-27,"John Boehner , who stunned the political world on Friday when he announced his shock resignation as speaker of the House of Representatives , on Sunday launched a full - blooded attack on his rightwing Republican colleagues , calling them â€œfalse prophetsâ€ � and accusing them of lying about the possibility for radical change in Washington .
Boehner took to the air on CBS to get his own back on the increasingly belligerent right wing of his party that in effect forced his early resignation .
In an interview that was liberally dosed with a Boehner trademark â€ “ tear - laden emoting â€
“
he said : â€œThe Bible says : â€˜Beware of false prophets.â€
™
There are people out there spreading noise about how much can get done.â€ �
He went on : â€œWe have groups here in town , members of the House and Senate , who whip people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things that they know â€ “
they know â€ “ can never happen.â€
�
He made a further swipe at the radical right when he gave his advice for future Republican members of Congress : â€œHave the courage to do what you can do â€ “ itâ€ ™ s easy to do what you canâ€ ™ t do.â€
�
Boehner made his unconstrained attack on the right of his own party as the spectre of a government shutdown once again loomed over Washington .
He assured the American people that during his final 30 days in the speakership â€ “ the top post in the House â€ “ he would use his remaining muscle to make sure a funding bill went through to avert a second shutdown of the federal government in as many years .
Asked by CBS whether the shutdown would now happen , he said : â€œNo.â€ � Boehnerâ€ ™ s decision to walk away from the speakership was the culmination of an intensifying clash between Republican leaders in Congress and the burgeoning cabal of right - wing conservatives whose ranks have grown since the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014 .
Such conservatives wanted Boehner to show more mettle in standing up to President Obama , particularly over their desire to see the womenâ€ ™ s health organisation Planned Parenthood , which provides abortions , stripped of federal funding â€ “ an issue that brought the possibility of a shutdown to the fore .
Boehner used the last time a shutdown happened , in 2013 , as an example of rightwing conservatives acting as â€œfalse prophetsâ€ � .
â€œThe whole idea that we were going to shut down the government to get rid of Obamacare in 2013 , this plan never had a chance ,
â€ �
he said , adding that it was a â€œfoolâ€ ™ s errandâ€ � .
Asked whether he counted Ted Cruz , the senator for Texas who is running for the Republican presidential nomination , as one of his â€œfalse prophetsâ€ � , the speaker replied : â€œYou could pick a lot of names .
Iâ€ ™ ll leave you to choose them.â€ �
Having demurred , he then pointedly alluded to a speech at a recent fundraiser in which he had called Cruz a â€œjackassâ€ � .
While his performance will go down in history as one of the most forthright criticisms by a senior Republican of his own colleagues , as television the encounter was also marked by the extent of Boehnerâ€ ™ s tears .
He began welling up early on when he talked about the support his family had given him in his 25 years as a politician .
When the conversation turned to the pope , whom he invited to address Congress last week , the floodgates opened .
The tears came as Boehner described the pope blessing his six - week old grandson Alistair , and they came again when he related how the pope had asked Boehner to pray for him .
â€œWell , you can imagine , I was a mess , â€ �
he said .
He declined to share on camera the flattering words the pope had said about him in their private conversation , saying : â€œI would repeat them , except it would really cause me to cry.â€ � Boehnerâ€ ™ s unexpected decision to stand down reduces the likelihood of a full - out confrontation between House Republicans and the White House
â€ “ something extreme conservatives have been gunning for â€
“ as the outgoing speaker will use the remainder of his political capital to usher through a compromise .
He indicated he would lean on the support of Democratic members of the House to get the funding bill through .
He told CBS he would skirt around the Planned Parenthood issue by creating a special committee to investigate the recent furore over clandestine videos featuring the organisationâ€ ™ s staff appearing to discuss the sale of foetal tissue .
That would take the subject out of the funding bill and avoid a presidential veto leading to government shutdown .
But though an immediate crisis is likely to be averted , in the long run nobody is of the delusion that things are going to get easier in Washington .
Another big crunch moment that the far - right Republicans will be eyeing gleefully falls on 11 December , when Obama and Congress will have to work together to pass a spending bill to raise the countryâ€ ™ s borrowing limit â€ “ or risk a national default .
Newt Gingrich , a former Republican speaker who was himself forced out by the right of the party in 1999 , predicted that Boehnerâ€ ™ s successor would face huge challenges .
Speaking on ABC , Gingrich linked the rising confidence of the Republican right wing to the surge of outsider contenders for the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination .
Gingrich , himself a candidate in 2012 , pointed out that Donald Trump , Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina now command 52 % of party support between them .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t a moment that Boehner can manage .
This is a different world with different requirements , â€ �
Gingrich said .
His point was underlined by Carson , a retired neurosurgeon with no experience of public office who has shot up to level - pegging status with Trump .
In the latest NBC News - Wall Street Journal poll , Trump is on 21 % of support among Republican primary voters and Carson is on 20 % .
Carson told ABC that in his view it was time for new leadership of the party in the House .
â€œThere is a lot of unrest , â€ � he said .
â€œPeople feel that a lot of people have been sent to Congress over the last few years , but nothing has changed .
Itâ€ ™ s time for results.â€ � Carson also said Boehner had served his country well for many years , and â€œI donâ€ ™ t see any reason to denigrate himâ€ � .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s time to move on , â€ � he said ."
2015-09-29,"The US congressman who is leading the public inquiry against Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s use of a private email server could continue his rambunctious rise to Washington power , if a drafting effort by the Republican far right succeeds in the wake of John Boehnerâ€ ™ s shock resignation .
Trey Gowdy , the South Carolina representative and chair of the House select committee on Benghazi , has been a thorn in the side of the former secretary and current White House frontrunner â€ “ and has forced her to testify before him next month .
Now , hardline conservatives like those who drove Boehner to step down as House speaker last week are recruiting the fiery former prosecutor to take his crusades up a notch : as Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives .
Gowdyâ€ ™ s chairmanship of the Benghazi committee has made him a rightwing hero of sorts .
Mia Love , the first - term representative from Utah who has quickly risen to influence in the Republican ranks , tweeted on Tuesday : â€œJoin me in drafting Trey Gowdy for Majority Leader .
Representative Jason Chaffetz , the chair of the House oversight committee , told Fox News on Tuesday that Gowdy as majority leader would be â€œheaven - sentâ€ � , adding in a statement that Gowdy was â€œthe best person to unite our conference and articulate the Republican messageâ€ � as â€œwidely trusted and beloved in our conferenceâ€ � .
â€œI actually think heâ€ ™ ll do it if we get behind it and support it ,
â€ �
Chaffetz said on Fox .
But Gowdy would face equally controversial opponents in succeeding as majority leader Kevin McCarthy , who is widely expected to succeed Boehner as speaker of the house .
There appear to be two other leading candidates for the second - ranking position in the Republican - controlled House : Tom Price of Georgia and Steve Scalise of Louisiana .
Scalise , currently third in the party hierarchy , found himself in a firestorm in December when it emerged that he had spoken at a white supremacist conference in New Orleans which was also addressed by former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke .
Price is the chair of the House budget committee , and already has the endorsement of his predecessor and Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s former running mate Paul Ryan , which strengthens his bona fides among fiscal hawks .
If Gowdy were to become majority leader , it would be almost impossibleto continue as chair of the Benghazi committee , which will welcome Clinton on 22 October .
But his rise to such a position would signal that a battle for the soul of the Republican party had indeed shifted to the right , where squabbles over Benghazi and an Internal Revenue Service targeting scandal have frustrated establishment conservatives in intransigent Washington .
â€œNow is not the time for more infighting , â€ �
former House majority leader Eric Cantor wrote in an op - ed for the New York Times on Friday .
â€œNow is the time to come together and lay out a positive , honest governing platform to take the country forward.â€ �
A spokesperson for Gowdy did not rule out a bid for more power .
â€œChairman Gowdy is focused on the Benghazi committee and will serve in that capacity so long as the committee exists , â€ � a spokesperson told the Guardian on Tuesday .
â€œHe appreciates the confidence of his colleagues and looks forward to tonightâ€ ™ s conference discussion.â€ � Support for Gowdy to succeed McCarthy first emerged after a Republican conference gathering on Tuesday morning , with the endorsement of New York representative Lee Zeldin as well .
Another conference meeting was expected at 5 pm ET ."
2015-09-30,"Congress has voted to keep the government funded until 11 December , sending a continuing resolution to the president on Wednesday afternoon in what will be John Boehnerâ€ ™ s final budget fight as speaker of the House .
The vote powered the â€œcleanâ€ � continuing resolution bill through the House of Representatives 277 to 151 , including 91 Republican votes .
No Democrats voted against the bill , which passed through the Senate on Wednesday morning with overwhelming bipartisan support .
One of those votes was from Representative Kevin McCarthy , the California Republican hotly tipped to replace Boehner as speaker when he steps down at the end of October .
With McCarthy poised to ascend to the speakership as expected , there is already a fight to replace him as House majority leader .
The two frontrunners for that job are Representative Tom Price of Georgia and Representative Steve Scalise , the current majority whip , from Louisiana .
Of those two , only Price voted against the funding bill .
Just before the vote , McCarthy â€ “ who voted for the bill â€ “ posted this on Twitter :
If he becomes speaker , holding this â€œteamâ€ � together will occupy much , if not all , of McCarthyâ€ ™ s time .
It is not known whether this will be Boehnerâ€ ™ s last big fight of any kind as speaker .
He could theoretically introduce a bill raising the debt ceiling , and continue his run of taking as many of the partyâ€ ™ s poison pills as possible before stepping down .
This would cement a legacy â€ “ but also create further disdain for him within the partyâ€ ™ s right wing ."
2015-10-04,"The Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz has formally announced that he will run for speaker of the House , throwing the leadership race to succeed John Boehner into chaos .
In interviews with Fox News Sunday and Politico , Chaffetz presented himself as a conservative alternative to House majority leader Kevin McCarthy , who has long been considered the likely successor to Boehner .
Boehner , from Ohio , announced his resignation last month .
He will step down at the end of October .
Chaffetz expressed his dissatisfaction with the status quo in the House GOP caucus and said :
â€œRealistically , we canâ€ ™ t vote to promote the existing leadership.â€ �
He also suggested that while McCarthy could muster support from a majority of House Republicans in a secret ballot , he would be unable to get the absolute majority of congressmen in a vote on the floor of the House .
Chaffetz said he could serve as a compromise candidate , because â€œthere are very few people who can win the support of our hardcore conservatives and yet be palatable to our more moderate membersâ€ � .
Prior to Chaffetzâ€ ™ s entry into the race , McCarthyâ€ ™ s only announced opposition had come from the Florida congressman Dan Webster , who challenged Boehner for the speakership earlier this year and received only 12 votes .
McCarthy , from California , has come under new scrutiny after comments last week in which he said the Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clintonâ€ ™
s
â€œnumbers are droppingâ€ � in polls because of the work of a House select committee investigating Benghazi .
The remark , which opened McCarthy to accusations of political bias in the conduct of Congressional business , immediately became a cudgel with which Democrats could attack the work of the committee .
It also alienated Republicans who had long pushed for an investigation into the attack on the US facility in September 2012 , in which four Americans , including the ambassador to Libya , died .
House Republicans will determine their caucusâ€ ™ s choice to become the next speaker by secret ballot on Thursday ."
2015-10-07,"A cabal of far - right Republicans in Congress have announced that they are throwing their support behind the Florida congressman Daniel Webster to replace John Boehner as speaker .
Representatives John Fleming and Jim Jordan told reporters that the Houseâ€ ™ s so - called â€œFreedom Caucusâ€ � members have cast their votes for Webster , a Florida Republican and rising star in the party .
The announcement came just hours before members of the Freedom Caucus said they intend to vote as a bloc during the upcoming election to replace the current speaker of the House , John Boehner , a move which seems set to throw the party even further into disarray .
Speaking at a Conversations with Conservatives event â€ “ at which lunch was brought in from the outspoken , socially conservative fast - food chain Chik - fil -
A â€ “ Congressman Jim Jordan said that the Freedom Caucus had â€œevery
intentionâ€
� of voting as a group both in Thursdayâ€
™ s
secret GOP ballot and in the floor vote of the House of Representatives for the new speaker on 29 October .
The move complicates what previously looked like the smooth election of Boehnerâ€ ™
s favoured successor , the current house majority leader , Kevin McCarthy .
A former speaker of the Florida state house of representatives , Webster is seen as a rising star of the conservative far right .
He rose to semi - prominence in the House following an attempted coup against Boehner in January 2015 , which saw him draw the second - highest number of votes .
McCarthy will need 218 Republican votes to gain the speakership , but the Freedom Caucus bloc support for Webster makes that all but impossible .
â€œYes , we have positions that some people will call extreme , â€ � said Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho , one of the chairs of the meeting , adding that while his caucus was willing to work with the GOP leadership for a compromise , â€œwhat we currently have is emasculated ourselvesâ€ � .
Thomas Massie , a conservative Republican congressman from Kentucky , is not formally a member of the Freedom Caucus , but appeared to speak for many of them at the meeting on Wednesday when he said that McCarthy was â€œabsolutely not an optionâ€ � , adding that McCarthyâ€ ™ s comments about the Benghazi committee last week â€œdisqualify him not just as speaker , but as majority leaderâ€ � .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s not 218 [ votes ] for McCarthy or for anyone , â€ �
Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas told the meeting .
The Democratic congressman and House minority whip , Steny Hoyer , demurred in a briefing on Tuesday as to whether , as one reporter asked , there might be â€œchicaneryâ€ � in the House surrounding the election of a speaker .
Such chicanery , it was suggested , might include Democrats putting their support behind one of the Republican candidates rather than automatically giving a losing vote to the current minority leader , Nancy Pelosi .
But Democratic congressman Brad Sherman of California told the Guardian that the Freedom Caucus bloc vote might create a situation where Democrats in the house would vote â€œpresentâ€ � , a technicality in House procedure which would help McCarthyâ€ ™ s election as speaker .
â€œIâ€ ™ m sure the Democrats will have discussions with McCarthy , â€ � he said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure the Freedom Caucus will like those discussions , but I know that Democrats are ready to vote â€˜presentâ€ ™

2015-10-08,"As the so - called â€œfreedom caucusâ€ � of the Republican party begins working in earnest to consolidate their power in the House of Representatives , House Democrats may come to view the tenure of outgoing speaker John Boehner with serious nostalgia , several high - ranking House Democrats told the Guardian .
The Freedom Caucus , a group of Tea Party conservatives , have come to loathe Boehner for working too closely with House Democrats and the White House to pass bills â€ “ including last weekâ€ ™ s continuing resolution to fund the government â€ “ despite their inclusion of provisions hated by the right , such as funding for Planned Parenthood and Obamacare .
Many conservatives in the House Republican Caucus also see the current majority leader , Kevin McCarthy , who is the frontrunner to replace Boehner , as a disagreeable option .
As the moment nears for the Republicans to pick Boehnerâ€ ™ s successor , some Democrats are realising that while Boehner was their ideological opponent , and was at times downright obstructive , he may have been in some ways one of their closest allies on Capitol Hill in negotiations with Democrats , and in dealing with the Freedom Caucus â€ “ who have made it clear that they are more than willing to shut the government down over ideological issues .
President Obama gave a glowing political eulogy for Boehner after the speaker announced his retirement .
â€œHe is a patriot , he cares deeply about the House , an institution in which he has served for a long time , he cares about his constituents and he cares about America , â€ �
he said .
â€œHe is somebody who has been gracious , and I think maybe most importantly is somebody who understands that in governance
, you donâ€ ™ t get 100 % of what you want , but you have to work with people who you disagree with , sometime strongly , in order to do the peopleâ€ ™ s business , â€ � Obama concluded .
The president was not the only high - profile Democrat to praise the speaker .
Representative Steny Hoyer , the Democratic House minority whip , said that Boehner stepping down was â€œa loss to the institution and a loss to the countryâ€ � .
Hoyer said that the reason for this was that Boehner â€œevidenced a desire for responsibility .
He couldnâ€ ™ t always effect that responsibility .
But in the end , he did get there â€ “ over the objections and without the majority support of most of his party.â€ �
He pointed to the continuing resolution vote as an example , and said that he hoped that before Boehner left , he could get more things done â€ “ potentially including another raise in the debt ceiling .
â€œIf
it were just a question of Republican politics , then maybe the country could say , â€˜do your own thingâ€ ™ ,â€ �
Maryland congressman Chris van Hollen , the former chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) , told the Guardian .
â€œThe problem is itâ€ ™ s having a very difficult impact on governance .
All this talk of shutdown ; games with the debt ceiling , is creating instability and uncertainty.â€ � Van Hollen , who is running for Senate in 2016 , described the Freedom Caucus as â€œa group of people who at every juncture are saying , â€˜itâ€ ™ s our way or the highwayâ€ ™ .
They donâ€ ™ t
have [ their own candidate for ] the speaker they want , but they have the votes to bring down the speaker at any time .
If they are going to vote as a bloc , it suggests there will be a lot of turmoil in the Republican caucus.â€ � Molly Reynolds , a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution , told the Guardian that there were â€œcertainly some Democrats in both the House and the Senate who are going to miss Boehner as the speakerâ€ � .
She said that partly this was because Boehner was â€œa known quantityâ€ � .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a reasonably conservative Republican , and heâ€ ™ ll be replaced by another Republican , â€ �
she said .
â€œBut I do think that the fact Boehner has been around the Hill for a while , and has real experience in these kind of negotiations and the stakes that are involved , made him very valuable for all parties.â€ �
Not all Democrats in Congress will miss the Boehner days , however .
Floridaâ€ ™ s Alan Greyson , who is currently running for the Senate , told the Guardian that he felt nothing would change , regardless of who replaces the outgoing speaker .
â€œI regard them all as interchangeable tools , â€ � he said .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think thereâ€ ™ s any material difference among any of the relevant candidates .
Theyâ€ ™ re all basically tools of billionaires and millionaires and multinational corporations and lobbyists.â€ � â€œThereâ€ ™ s not a dimeâ€ ™ s worth of difference amongst them , â€ � he added ."
2015-10-08,"Chaos overtook the Republican party on Thursday , as the election for a new House speaker was postponed after current majority whip Kevin McCarthy backed out of the race .
The current House speaker , John Boehner , told the conference that the election was postponed at a meeting that was supposed to see the House Republicans vote for their nominee for speaker .
It is still unclear whether the vote on the House floor for speaker , which had been scheduled for 29 October , will be postponed .
No new date has yet been set for the Republican party vote , which would have selected the GOP nominee today .
In a statement , Boehner said : â€œAfter Leader McCarthyâ€ ™ s announcement , members of the House Republican Conference will not vote today for a new speaker .
As I have said previously , I will serve as speaker until the House votes to elect a new speaker .
We will announce the date for this election at a later date , and Iâ€ ™ m confident we will elect a new speaker in the coming weeks.â€ � â€œI think I shocked some of you , huh , â€ �
McCarthy said to reporters outside the meeting .
He said that he had decided that he had to â€œput this conference firstâ€ � .
He said he would stay on as majority leader , but that the party needed â€œa new faceâ€ � as speaker .
â€œI feel good about the decision , â€ � he said .
The surprise move came just 24 hours after the so - called Freedom Caucus , a group of hardline rightwing Republicans , announced that they were backing Daniel Webster against McCarthy .
â€œTwo minutes ago I was in there listening to what I thought was going to be his nominating speech , only to learn that heâ€ ™ s not running , â€ � said Ryan Costello of California .
â€œMcCarthy backed out , said he was not going to run at this time , then Speaker Boehner got up , said the election was postponed , then the chairwoman banged the gavel and the meeting was over ,
â€ �
Costello said .
â€œAnd then we all looked around at one another and I donâ€
™ t think half of us knew what had happened.â€ � Representative Jason Chaffetz , whose own campaign to be speaker was thought to have run aground before Thursdayâ€
™ s announcement by McCarthy turned the race on its head , told reporters that he was still running â€ “ though he hinted it was too early to say whether McCarthyâ€ ™ s exit made him the frontrunner .
Chaffetz said he was â€œsurprised , stunned and shockedâ€ � by the announcement .
â€œ[I ] didnâ€ ™ t see that coming .
Kevin McCarthy is a very good man , and he has always been one that puts his country before everyone else.â€ �
He said that he and McCarthy â€œstand shoulder to shoulder with the same desire , and that is to unite this partyâ€ � .
â€œI really do believe it is time for a fresh start , â€ � he continued .
â€œThat is the whole genesis of my campaign.â€ �
But , he said , the conference â€œis going to have to do some deep soul - searchingâ€ � .
Darrell Issa , an influential California Republican congressman and chair of the House oversight committee , said â€œI think itâ€ ™ s obvious that all members of the conference were shockedâ€ � by McCarthyâ€ ™ s sudden withdrawal .
â€œKevin McCarthy had the vast majority of the conferenceâ€ ™ s confidence and votes ,
â€ �
Issa said , â€œbut he made the decision that he couldnâ€ ™ t get to [ the requisite ] 218 [ votes on the House floor ] , and as a result heâ€ ™ s taken himself out of the race.â€ �
McCarthy was considered Boehnerâ€ ™ s favoured candidate .
Thursdayâ€ ™ s developments show the extreme state of disarray in which House Republicans now find themselves , with the balance of power in the hands of an extreme conservative minority who have the ability to topple the speaker at any time â€ “ a situation which may see Democrats becoming nostalgic for the Boehner era .
It would have been unprecedented for a large bloc such as the Freedom Caucus to have voted against the partyâ€ ™ s choice of nominee , as they had hinted they might do with Webster .
On Thursday morning , about half the Republican conference gathered in a basement meeting room in the Capitol for a forum in which the candidates for speaker made their pitches .
â€œAll three did well ,
â€ �
Tom Cole , the deputy majority whip , told the Guardian , referring to McCarthy , Webster and Chaffetz , who had tried to position himself as a bridge between the ideological extremes of the party .
Many rightwing House Republicans object to what they see as having been a period of autocratic , high - handed rule by Boehner .
â€œThe false , lazy narrative is we want a more conservative speaker ,
â€ �
Justin Amash told a meeting of conservatives on Wednesday .
â€œWhat we want is a process speaker â€ ¦ who follows the House rules .
â€œIf the rules are followed , sometimes weâ€ ™
ll get our way , sometimes we wonâ€ ™ t .
People get too uptight in this place about who votes with us , â€ � Amash added .
But there has also been an ideological component to the Freedom Caucusâ€ ™ s objections to the Boehner - McCarthy approach .
Steve King nominated Webster for speaker in January 2015 , during a failed coup attempt against Boehner , and told the Guardian he was going to support him again in Thursdayâ€ ™ s conference ballot .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s the strongest on immigration ,
heâ€ ™ s the most anti - amnesty of the three candidates , so thatâ€ ™ s another piece for me , â€ �
King said .
â€œFor me the only vote that matters is on 29 October , â€ � Tom Massie told the Guardian .
Massie , who is a hardline conservative but not a member of the Freedom Caucus , said at a meeting of conservatives on Wednesday that McCarthy was â€œabsolutely not an optionâ€ � because of his comments about the Benghazi committee .
Massie also downplayed the importance of Thursdayâ€ ™ s vote .
â€œConference is fine for electing a majority leader and conference chair and whatever the heck positions you want to make up , â€ � he added ,
â€œbut thereâ€
™ s only one in the constitution and thatâ€ ™ s the speaker , and he only becomes the speaker by getting a majority of the people , so itâ€ ™ s only about the floor vote .
â€œWith Boehnerâ€ ™ s departure , I think itâ€ ™ s unwise to advocate the beatings will continue until morale improves , â€ � he said .
â€œThat seems to be the theme behind â€˜weâ€ ™ re going to kick you out of the conference if you donâ€ ™ t vote for the person we pickâ€
™
.â€ �
In a statement , the Senate minority leader , Harry Reid , said : â€œThe utter chaos of the Republican party must not threaten the full faith and credit of the United States and the American people .
â€œRepublican chaos is likely to get worse before it gets better but the economic livelihood of the American people should not be threatened as a result of Republicansâ€ ™ inability to govern , â€ � Reid continued .
Asked by a reporter in a House corridor why nobody wanted to be speaker , the Democratic minority leader and former speaker , Nancy Pelosi , said : â€œYouâ€ ™ ll just have to ask nobody.â€ �

2015-10-08,"After the chaos of Thursday afternoonâ€ ™ s abortive vote to choose a Republican nominee to replace John Boehner as speaker of the House of Representatives , momentum grew behind a campaign to draft the former vice - presidential candidate Paul Ryan to the job .
In the aftermath of majority leader Kevin McCarthyâ€ ™ s shock withdrawal from contention
, Ryan issued a statement denying any interest in running for the job himself .
â€œWhile
I am grateful for the encouragement Iâ€ ™ ve received , â€ �
he said , â€œI will not be a candidate .
I continue to believe I can best serve the country and this conference as chairman of the ways and means committee.â€ �
During a House vote Thursday afternoon , however , Ryan could be seen talking with Trey Gowdy â€ “ the chair of the select committee on Benghazi who was touted by some to become majority leader , back when McCarthy looked all but set to take the speakerâ€ ™ s gavel .
On Ryanâ€ ™ s other side was Representative Peter Roskam , also considered a potential leadership candidate .
Ryan could be seen speaking animatedly .
At one point , he appeared to lean back and sigh with exasperation .
McCarthy announced he was dropping out of the race for speaker in a noon meeting of the Republican House conference , a move which â€œstunnedâ€ � the room .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been a fan of Paul Ryan since before any of this , â€ �
Gowdy told reporters including the Guardian outside the House chamber .
Asked if he thought Ryan would run , Gowdy said : â€œIâ€ ™ m going to let Paul speak for himself .
Heâ€ ™ s uniquely gifted and qualified for the position.â€
�
He also described Ryan , noted in the House for his expertise on budgetary matters , as â€œthe smartest kid in the classâ€ � .
Asked who could unify the party , Gowdy referred to Pope Francis when he said :
â€œEither [ Ryan ] or the fellow who just went back to Italy.â€ � Justin Amash , a founding member of the â€œfreedom caucusâ€ �
â€ “ the group of hard - right House Republicans whose backing of Daniel Webster may have precipitated McCarthyâ€ ™ s exit from the race â€ “ told the Guardian : â€œThere are a couple of individuals , Trey Gowdy and Paul Ryan , who would be acceptable to the whole conference.â€ � Gowdy has forcefully said on numerous occasions that he is not interested in any leadership positions .
Sources reportedly told the Washington Post , meanwhile , that Boehner had called Ryan twice to ask him to run for speaker .
Ryan was reportedly â€œundecided but listeningâ€ � .
Politico reported that the former vice - presidential candidate from Wisconsin â€ “ who ran with Mitt Romney in 2012 â€ “ had cancelled all of his fundraisers for the next 48 hours .
Short of Gowdy and Ryan , it seems increasingly unlikely that any candidate for speaker will be able to muster the 218 Republican votes needed in a floor vote currently scheduled for 29 October .
If none of them can get there , Boehner may be forced to stay on until a new candidate can be found ."
2015-10-09,"Republicans in the House of Representatives remained in turmoil on Friday , as pressure mounted on a reluctant Paul Ryan to run for speaker when John Boehner steps down at the end of October .
The campaign to draft Ryan , the chair of the House ways and means committee and 2012 vice - presidential candidate , began following the abortive vote to choose a Republican nominee on Thursday .
In the aftermath of majority leader Kevin McCarthyâ€ ™ s shock withdrawal from contention
, Ryan issued a statement denying any interest in running for the job .
â€œWhile
I am grateful for the encouragement Iâ€ ™ ve received , â€ � the Wisconsin representative said , â€œI will not be a candidate .
I continue to believe I can best serve the country and this conference as chairman of the ways and means committee.â€ �
But outside a meeting of House Republicans on Friday morning Darrell Issa , the influential chair of the oversight committee , said : â€œEveryone is universally asking Paul Ryan to go home over the weekend and reconsider.â€ �
â€œPaul Ryanâ€ ™ s been meeting with everyone non - stop , â€ �
Issa said .
â€œToo many of us have his phone number and know where he works out in the morning .
He is dealing with the fact that this isnâ€ ™ t a job he asked for or even wants â€ “ but it may be a job that the conference needs him to take.â€ �
Issa has said that he will enter the race for speaker , but only if Ryan is definitely out .
â€œThere isnâ€ ™ t a race for speaker at this point , â€ � he said .
â€œWhat there is is every member trying to come to 240-some votes for a candidate , and at this point , thatâ€ ™ s
Paul Ryan.â€
�
Issa said he would not campaign until Ryanâ€ ™ s candidacy was â€œput to restâ€ � .
â€œRight now weâ€

Asked by reporters how the meeting went , the congressman from New York said : â€œFine !
Weâ€ ™ re one big happy family .
We love each other.â€ �
â€œReally?â€ � a reporter asked .
â€œNo , â€ � King said .
King said Ryan , an influential voice on budgetary matters who was Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s presidential running mate in 2012 , was the only person with the clout to run for speaker .
But King was damning about the situation .
â€œI think it looks like chaos , â€ � he said .
â€œAnd it is.â€ � â€œI hope Paul looks inside , I hope he finds that this is the right decision for him , â€ � Tom Cole , the deputy majority leader , told reporters .
Justin Amash , a founding member of the â€œfreedom caucusâ€ �
â€ “ the group of hard - right House Republicans whose backing of Daniel Webster of Florida may have precipitated McCarthyâ€ ™ s exit from the race â€ “ told the Guardian on Thursday : â€œThere are a couple of individuals , Trey Gowdy and Paul Ryan , who would be acceptable to the whole conference.â€ � Outside the meeting on Friday , John Fleming , another founding member of the freedom caucus , said the group would continue to support Webster â€œuntil such time as the number of candidates might changeâ€ � .
In a hint that the freedom caucus would consider uniting with the conference behind a Ryan candidacy , he added : â€œThere are a number of personalities out thereâ€ � .
â€œWe want to talk to any new candidates , â€ � Fleming said .
Jason Chaffetz , a declared candidate for speaker , told reporters he would drop out of the race if Ryan entered it .
Webster , one of the last to leave the meeting , said he would not .
â€œIâ€
™ m going to run in the conference no matter what , â€ � he said .
During a House vote Thursday afternoon , Ryan could be seen talking with Gowdy â€ “ the popular chair of the select committee on Benghazi who was touted by some to become majority leader , back when McCarthy looked all but set to take the speakerâ€ ™ s gavel .
On Ryanâ€ ™ s other side was Peter Roskam , also a potential leadership candidate .
Ryan could be seen speaking animatedly .
At one point , he appeared to lean back and sigh with exasperation .
McCarthy announced that he was dropping out of the race for speaker in a noon meeting of the Republican House conference , a move which â€œstunnedâ€ � the room .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been a fan of Paul Ryan since before any of this , â€ �
Gowdy told reporters including the Guardian outside the House chamber .
Asked then if he thought Ryan would run , Gowdy said : â€œIâ€ ™ m going to let Paul speak for himself .
Heâ€ ™ s uniquely gifted and qualified for the position.â€
�
He also described Ryan as â€œthe smartest kid in the classâ€ � .
Asked who could unify the party , Gowdy referred to Pope Francis when he said :
â€œEither [ Ryan ] or the fellow who just went back to Italy.â€ �
Gowdy has forcefully said on many occasions that he is not interested in any leadership positions .
Sources reportedly told the Washington Post that Boehner had called Ryan twice to ask him to run .
Ryan was â€œundecided but listeningâ€ � .
Politico reported that Ryan cancelled all of his fundraisers for the next 48 hours , after the election meeting on Thursday .
Short of Gowdy and Ryan , it seems increasingly unlikely any candidate will be able to muster the 218 Republican votes needed in a floor vote that is currently scheduled for 29 October .
If none of them can get there , Boehner may be forced to stay on until a new candidate can be found ."
2015-10-11,"Republican rebels and defenders of the party line found a shred of common cause on Sunday , in the hope that one man might be able to quell the chaos in their ranks .
After a week of party chaos , hardline conservatives and their establishment opponents agreed on one thing :
Wisconsinâ€ ™ s Paul Ryan may be the only person able to unite the party as speaker of the House , one of the most powerful positions in Washington , during critical months of the presidential primary and under the threat of another government shutdown .
After current speaker John Boehner announced his resignation and his presumptive successor , Kevin McCarthy , withdrew from contention , Ryan said he would not run .
After extensive pleading from panicked colleagues , however , the chair of the House ways and means committee , who was Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s presidential running mate in 2012 , said he would reconsider and retreated to Wisconsin for the weekend .
Nonetheless , far - right and Tea Party conservatives pressed their case on Sunday for a major shake - up inside the party .
â€œWe need a fresh start , â€ � said Jason Chaffetz , himself running for the position , in an interview with ABC .
â€œWe have a gulf , a divide that needs to be bridged.â€ � Chaffetz , of Utah , said he would support Ryan
should he decide to run , but insisted the party needed fundamental change nonetheless .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a need for some internal reform , â€ � he said , before listing several issues rightwing Republicans hope will diminish the authority of the speaker .
â€œThe idea is to allow these good bills and ideas to percolate from the bottom up , rather than a top - down where the speaker is telling everybody what to do.â€
�
House Republicans farther to the right , many of whom have joined a group calling itself the Freedom Caucus , have nominated Florida representative Daniel Webster .
â€œWhat we are going to do is change the culture , â€ � said RaÃºl Labrador of Idaho , a member of the group , on CNN .
Labrador said rightwing Republicans wanted to make sure every member â€œfeels valuableâ€ � in Congress .
Freedom Caucus leader Jim Jordan , from Ohio , hinted that his group could back Ryan should he agree to take some powers away from the Republican leadership in the House .
â€œPaul Ryan is a good man , â€ � Jordan said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a great communicator , the kind of messenger our party needs and certainly if he gets in the race
I think our group would look favorably on him.â€
�
Tom Cole of Oklahoma , a senior party figure who earlier in the week derided conservative upstarts for wanting more authority than they had earned , also tried to downplay the internecine intrigue .
â€œThis process , as chaotic as it looks from the outside , â€ � he said on CNN , sitting next to Labrador , â€œit probably has been healthy .
A lot of things are being aired that probably needed to be aired.â€
�
Manny of Coleâ€ ™ s peers disagree , including Peter King of New York , another establishment stalwart who said earlier this week :
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t go on like this with one small group , a tiny minority , hijack[ing ]
the party.â€ � Such party rifts have been reflected in the Republican presidential race , where candidates with no experience in government , like billionaire Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , have for months dominated the polls over former and current governors and senators .
Trump scorned the partyâ€ ™ s disunity , telling CBS in an interview broadcast on Sunday congressional Republicans were â€œterrible negotiatorsâ€ � .
He said that while he disagreed with some of Ryanâ€ ™ s positions , he would be â€œOKâ€ � with him as speaker .
â€œI think he doesnâ€ ™ t want it very badly , but you never know , â€ � Trump said .
â€œMaybe heâ€ ™ s playing one of the great games of all time.â€
�
The billionaire insisted that the party needed to fight even harder for its principles and rid itself of leaders who â€œnever winâ€ � .
â€œWe need toughness , â€ � he said .
â€œWe need fists , we need the brainpower , and we need toughness.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s populist rhetoric has won him the support of enough of the partyâ€ ™ s grassroots to buoy him at the top of the polls , even as his inflammatory remarks about immigrants , women and others have exasperated party leaders .
Carson also appeared on CBS on Sunday .
He suggested that the party revolt was inevitable , saying : â€œThe electorate is getting pretty frustrated and I think thatâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s being reflected in Congress right now.â€ �
Even staffers , usually anonymous workers in the trenches of the Capitol , have started breaking ranks .
One former staffer , Bradley Podliska , a self - declared lifetime Republican who was fired as an investigator for the GOP - led House committee on the September 2012 Benghazi attack , said on Saturday the probe was a partisan ploy to undermine the Democratic frontrunner , Hillary Clinton , rather than to find out what caused the deaths of four Americans in Libya .
On the talk shows , the politicians closed ranks .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never met this person ,
I donâ€
™ t know this person , â€ � Chaffetz said .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think itâ€ ™ s
accurate.â€ �
Labrador similarly tried to downplay the criticism , although he did not deny that the committee could have political intentions .
â€œHe said the investigation is currently political according to his opinion , â€ �
he said .
â€œHe said he felt [ its intentions ] had changed.â€ �"
2015-10-21,"Paul Ryanâ€ ™ s fate as a potential speaker of the House rests in the hands of the roughly 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus .
Ryan , who on Tuesday night put himself forward conditionally as a compromise candidate to replace John Boehner as speaker , has said he needs the backing of the conservative Freedom Caucus as well as two other groupings of House Republicans , the conservative Republican Study Committee and the moderate Tuesday Group .
The support of the latter two groups is a purely pro forma request , but the challenge for Ryan is the Freedom Caucus , made up of the 40 Tea Party Republicans who helped push Boehner out of office and served an immovable roadblock to majority leader Kevin McCarthyâ€ ™ s chances of succeeding the Ohio Republican .
McCarthy , citing the partyâ€ ™ s fractures , dropped out of contention earlier this month .
In a meeting that lasted an hour on Wednesday afternoon , the members of the Freedom Caucus met with Ryan in his office in what the Wisconsin Republican called â€œa nice meeting , a good chat with colleaguesâ€ � .
After Ryan left , the Freedom Caucus remained in his office for nearly a half hour .
Afterwards , members of the caucus â€ “ who are well known for giving fiery quotes and dishing to reporters â€ “ were unusually closed - lipped .
Almost to a member , they insisted simply â€œit was a very productive meetingâ€ � .
The Freedom Caucusâ€ ™ s restrictive rules require the support of four - fifths of its members to make an endorsement , and Ryan has insisted if he doesnâ€ ™ t get their endorsement , he wonâ€ ™ t run for speaker .
It is unlikely that any other candidate could unite House Republicans , who are scheduled to vote on Boehnerâ€ ™ s replacement next week .
Before Ryan agreed to enter the race on Tuesday night , the Freedom Caucus had endorsed Florida Republican Dan Webster , and they would need to reverse their vote by the same four - fifths margin to meet Ryanâ€ ™ s conditions .
Members of the Freedom Caucus also had qualms about Ryanâ€ ™ s pledge to make a change to congressional procedure by changing the requirements for a motion to vacate , a tactic which allows the incumbent speaker to be removed by a simple majority .
However , there seems to be some room for compromise .
Freedom Caucus member David Brat of Virginia told the Guardian before the groupâ€ ™ s meeting with Ryan that there were a variety of options for his fellow Tea Party Republicans , and that the vote might not just be about an endorsement .
â€œItâ€ ™ s in play in the sense
you can have 80 % on a whole range of question , youâ€ ™ re just assuming thereâ€ ™ s
one question.â€
�
Fellow Freedom Caucus member Mark Sanford also said that the procedural issue should not be sufficient grounds to reject Ryanâ€ ™ s candidacy .
â€œThis is not a sword either side in this debate needs to die on , â€ � he said .
Sanford compared it to medieval monks arguing about â€œhow many angels dance on the head of a pinâ€ � .
Members of the Freedom Caucus continued to meet on Wednesday night in a conference room in a House office building , to make a final decision about their endorsement .
However , it seemed Ryan already won over at least one Freedom Caucus member in his closed - door meeting .
Early in the afternoon , Indiana Republican Marlin Stutzman praised Webster while making clear the situation â€œwas very fluidâ€ � and that he was talking to both â€œPaul and Dan Websterâ€ � .
By Wednesday night , he made clear that he would be pushing for his fellow Freedom Caucus members to support Ryan ."
2015-10-22,"Paul Ryan is officially running for speaker of the House of Representatives .
In a letter sent to Republican colleagues on Thursday afternoon , the 2012 vice - presidential nominee formally announced he would seek to replace John Boehner as speaker .
â€œI
never thought Iâ€ ™ d be speaker .
But I pledged to you that if I could be a unifying figure , then I would serve â€ “ I would go all in , â€ � wrote Ryan .
â€œAfter talking with so many of you , and hearing your words of encouragement , I believe we are ready to move forward as one , united team .
And I am ready and eager to be our speaker.â€ �
The statement marks the end of a dizzying few weeks on Capitol Hill , which started with the shock resignation of Boehner as speaker of the House after mounting pressure from the arch - conservative Freedom Caucus .
Shortly afterwards , the Ohio Republicanâ€ ™ s anointed successor , House majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , decided not to run for fear of inheriting the same divided conference that Boehner had to preside over .
Ryan was then pressured to enter the speakerâ€ ™ s race as a consensus candidate who could unite all wings of the party .
The Wisconsin Republican conditionally put himself forward on Tuesday night provided he could secure agreement from the Freedom Caucus and two other groups in the House Republican conference .
After 24 hours of courtship and negotiation , Ryan finally secured the support , although not the formal endorsement , of the Freedom Caucus on Wednesday night .
Ryan , a nine - term congressman from southern Wisconsin , currently serves as chair of the House ways and means committee .
He is expected to be formally chosen as the Republican conferenceâ€ ™ s choice for speaker in a secret ballot election on Wednesday .
There will then be a vote on the House floor on Thursday where Ryan is expected to receive the majority required to be elected ."

Then you had a better day than Texas senator Ted Cruz , who was put on blast in a speech former House speaker John Boehner gave to college students that was equal parts fire and brimstone .
â€œLucifer in the flesh , â€ �

In a week when we thought nothing could get more bizarre than vice presidential would - be Carly Fiorina bursting into song , today was really a feat of political imagination .
Hereâ€ ™ s a quick rundown of the biggest news from the campaign trail today :
After Boehnerâ€ ™ s â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � comments ( sidenote : Weâ€ ™ re going to start giving this review about normal stuff and people : â€œHow was
brunch?â€ � â€œIt was Lucifer in the flesh .
A miserable son of a bitch.â€ � ) the Texas senator distanced himself from the former House speaker , telling reporters in a news conference in Fort Wayne , Indiana , that he had only met Boehner a handful of times .
â€œHe allowed his inner Trump to come out , â€ � Cruz added .
Speak of the Devil and he doth appear : Donald Trump lucked out with todayâ€ ™ s Luciferian news cycle , and picked up the endorsement of House transportation committee chair Bill Shuster to boot .
Throw in the resigned endorsement of former Mitt Romney aide Ron Kaufman - who compared Trump to Ronald Reagan - and heâ€ ™ s got himself a party .
While Trump is making nice with members of Congress and the Republican establishment , it seems like his two opponents for the Republican nomination canâ€ ™ t even go 24 hours without betraying one another . .
A short few days after a strategic alignment between Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich implied that the two would work together to deny Trump the nomination , and Cruz is already backing down from the deal .
â€œI recognize that the media is all eager to talk about an alliance , â€ �
Cruz said in the same press conference .
â€œThere is no alliance.â€ � Cut to John Weaver , a senior adviser to Kasich , tweeting this : What could that be about ?
As for the Democrats , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton unveiled a literal â€œWoman Cardâ€ � for her supporters , piggybacking on remarks made by Trump that she has characterized as sexist .
( The cards are modeled after New York Cityâ€ ™ s MetroCards , but hopefully swipe easier . )
Meanwhile , with his hopes of winning the Democratic nomination fading , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is hoping to make his mark on the Democratic party in another way - by reshaping the nomination process to allow non - Democrats to have their say .

Gloom and doom is the attitude of the day over at the newly minted Cruz / Fiorina campaign headquarters , as the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign sends out a mailer to supporters warning them that if he loses the Indiana primary on May 3 , billionaire frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s march to the Republican presidential nomination could be â€œall but determined.â€ � â€œIn just five days , Hoosiers will cast their votes to determine which candidate will capture their 57 delegates .
This is the single , biggest , most important day for our campaign so far , â€ � Cruz writes .
â€œCarly

I canâ€

Friend , let me be blunt : I canâ€ ™ t win Indiana â€ “ and this nomination â€ “ if you donâ€ ™ t step forward right now.â€ �
Cruz tells voters that â€œIndiana is absolutely pivotal , â€ � and that â€œif
Trump wins all the delegates in Indiana , his nomination could be all but determined.â€ � Perennial presidential candidate and former consumer advocate Ralph Nader told CNN today that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders should not drop out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination , in part because Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton could be indicted .

â€œThere could be a scandal with Hillary Clinton .

Itâ€ ™ s being widely interpreted as a loophole allowing therapists to reject gay , lesbian , transgender and other clients .
Haslam has since issued a written statement saying thatâ€ ™ s a misinterpretation .
â€œThe substance of this bill doesnâ€ ™ t address a group , issue or belief system , â€ � he wrote .

An unbound Republican delegate in Pennsylvania who had previously endorsed John Kasich appears to have resigned himself to the fact that billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee - and says he would never vote for Texas senator Ted Cruz .
â€œI would never vote for Ted Cruz ,
â€ �
former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg told a local ABC affiliate in Manchester , New Hampshire .
â€œIâ€ ™ d write in Paul Ryan or someone before Iâ€ ™ d vote for Ted Cruz.â€ � â€œI presume Donald Trump is going to be the nominee , â€ � Gregg , a two - term senator , said , before calling Cruz â€œa person of little character .
Heâ€ ™ s a demagogueâ€ ™ s demagogue and he shouldnâ€ ™ t be trusted with the responsibilities of the office.â€ � â€œI presume Iâ€ ™
d vote for the Republican nominee if it is Trump , but Cruz should be nowhere near the presidency.â€ � John Kasich told spectators at an Oregon town hall event that Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s hopes of swaying unbound delegates to support his bid for the Republican nomination are unfounded , and that if he wants to become the nominee , â€œhe better get exactly what he needs.â€ � â€œWhen
you have a 73 % negative rating among married women and you think you are going to the convention , and you lose 15 straight polls to Hillary Clinton , and you get crushed in the electoral college , and we know that if you are the nominee , youâ€ ™ re going to lose the senate , the supreme court , the courthouse and the state house ...
â€ �
Kasich told the crowd , â€œI donâ€ ™ t think so.â€ �
Trump has the support of 953 bound delegates and 41 unbound delegates , putting him at 994 total delegates , within striking distance of the 1,237 needed to clinch the Republican nomination .
Neither Kasich nor fellow Republican hopeful Ted Cruz can feasibly acquire the necessary number of delegates to reach that threshold before the partyâ€ ™ s convention in July .
An organization dedicated to fighting anti - Semitism has issued a statement urging billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump to reconsider the use of â€œAmerica Firstâ€ � as his â€œill - advisedâ€ � campaign slogan to describe his foreign policy doctrine .
â€œThe most noteworthy leader of the â€˜America
First Committeeâ€ ™ was Charles Lindbergh , who sympathized with the Nazis and whose rhetoric was characterized by anti - Semitism and offensive stereotypes , including assertions that Jews posed a threat to the US because of their influence in motion pictures , radio , the press , and the government ,
â€ � wrote the Anti - Defamation League in in a statement .
â€œThe undercurrents of anti - Semitism and bigotry that characterized the America First movement â€ “ including the assumption that Jews who opposed the movement had their own agenda and were not acting in Americaâ€ ™ s best interest â€ “ is fortunately not a major concern today , â€ � said Jonathan A. Greenblatt , CEO of the Anti - Defamation League .
â€œHowever , for many Americans , the term â€˜America Firstâ€ ™ will always be associated with and tainted by this history .
In a political season that already has prompted a national conversation about civility and tolerance , choosing a call to action historically associated with incivility and intolerance seems ill - advised.â€ �
At an event in Oregon , Ohio governor and Republican candidate for president John Kasich told supporters that after Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s electoral wipeout earlier this week , he had considered dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination .
â€œI thought about , â€˜Should I keep going ?
Should I carry on ?
What is this all about?â€ ™ â€ � Kasich said .
But in the end , it came down to a conversation with his wife .
â€œI was down home yesterday for a short time , and things were a little bit crazy ...
and I saw my wife carrying some clothes from the upstairs bedroom down into the closet in the basement
and I said , â€˜here , lemme grab some of that , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œAnd I said , â€˜what do you think , sweetie ?
Iâ€ ™ m inclined to keep going.â€ ™
She looked at me , she said - just simple words because sheâ€ ™ s not a politician
- she said , â€˜The people need a choice , and if you donâ€ ™ t give â€˜em a choice , who will?â€ ™ â€ � â€œAnd so Iâ€ ™ ve decided to keep going ,
â€ � he concluded ,
to loud applause .
In an interview with Politico , a former high - ranking member of Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s failed 2012 presidential campaign has compared billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump to party icon Ronald Reagan , and said that Trump will win the nomination .
â€œYou could sense a more growing sense of reality that , in fact , Trump is going to be the nominee , â€ � said Ron Kaufman , a former advisor to Romney and one of the main engineers of his presidential campaign in 2012 .
â€œHe was a populist more than a conservative , â€ �
Kaufman said of Reagan .
â€œHe was a western populist ; Trump is an eastern populist.â€ �
Romney returned to the national stage years after his loss with a blistering indictment of Trump , dubbing the frontrunner â€œa phonyâ€ � and â€œa fraudâ€ � in an address in Salt Lake City , Utah .
A survey of 2,008 American adults conducted by the Pew Research Center has found that the publicâ€ ™ s negative opinion of the Republican party has spiked to levels not seen in nearly a quarter - century .
Only 33 % of the American public has a favorable view of the Republican party , while nearly two - thirds - 62 % - say that they have an unfavorable view of the party .
Itâ€ ™ s an increase in negative views of the party from last October , when a still - not - great 58 % told Pew Research Center that they viewed the Republican party unfavorably .
The frustration with the direction of the party has even passed on to card - carrying members of the party , only 68 % of whom view the Republican party positively .
By comparison , the Democratic party is viewed positively by 88 % of its members .
Just 28 % of independents view the Republican party favorably .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s big foreign policy speech at the National Press Club in Washington , DC yesterday has received a cold reception from the editorial board of the New York Times , which derided the address as failing to exhibit â€œmuch grasp of the complexity of the world , understanding of the balance or exercise of power , or even a careful reading of history.â€ �
In an editorial titled Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s Strange Worldview , the Grey Ladyâ€ ™ s editorial board summed up a potential â€œTrump
Doctrineâ€ � as : â€œWhen one has a hammer , everything looks like a nail .
And when oneâ€ ™ s experience is limited to real estate deals , everything looks like a lease negotiation.â€ �
This unilateral approach makes for good television , but this is the real world , in which other nations have agendas , too .
Mr. Trump says he is â€˜going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world , all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence.â€ ™
But how will he gain cooperation for his â€˜unpredictableâ€ ™ war on the Islamic State while enforcing a â€˜pauseâ€ ™ that prevents Muslims from entering this country , and forcing those living here to register themselves ?
How does one â€˜apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea , â€ ™ while slapping a trade - killing tariff on Chinese imports ?
Itâ€ ™ s correct that many of our NATO allies arenâ€ ™ t paying their agreed - upon share of its costs - but what happens to the United Statesâ€ ™ overseas bases if we â€˜walk?â€ ™
The editorial concludes that Trump has failed to demonstrate â€œany willingness to learn or to correct his past errors .
For someone who claims he is ready to lead the free world , that is inexcusable.â€ �
Texas senator Ted Cruz fired back at former House speaker John Boehner for comments comparing the Republican presidential hopeful to â€œLuciferâ€ � after his announcement of Carly Fiorina as his running mate .

Caitlyn Jenner has put billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s promise to allow transgender people to use whichever bathroom they feel most comfortable in at Trump Tower to the test .
The result : no problem .
In a Facebook video posted this morning , the Olympic gold medalist and reality television star used the womenâ€ ™ s room at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City without complications .
Transgender Americans received an unlikely endorsement from Trump when he told NBCâ€ ™ s Today show that transgender people should be allowed to choose the bathroom they use , and promised Jenner that she could use a restroom of her choosing at Trump Tower any time she wanted .
Hillary Clinton is fundraising off of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s comments regarding her gender by giving donors physical â€œWoman Cardsâ€ � - which more - than - vaguely resemble New York Cityâ€ ™ s MetroCard .

Senator Ted Cruz has little patience for campaign pranks : Bernie Sanders is scheduled to hold a campaign event in Springfield , Oregon , this afternoon - hereâ€ ™ s the livestream :
With a poll showing nearly half of Republican female voters donâ€ ™ t plan to support Donald Trump , his nomination looks disastrous for a party trying to reinvent itself , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino :
For the Republican women who have spent the past few years working to broaden the appeal of the Grand Old Party , Donald Trump arrived on the scene like a wrecking ball , tearing down the foundations they had laid over the past few years to try to create a more diverse and open party .
With his penchant for bluster and disdain for political correctness , there are few slices of the American electorate the billionaire businessman has yet to offend .
But one group in particular poses a real problem for Trump , should he become the nominee , and for the party , should it win the presidency and keep control of Congress in November â€ “ and that group happens to make up 51 % of the population .
â€œGeneral election women voters think heâ€
™ s abhorrent , â€ � said Katie Packer , the chairwoman of Our Principles PAC , which opposes Trump .
â€œThey think heâ€

They think he doesnâ€ ™ t respect women , and doesnâ€ ™ t really view women in any real way beyond their physical appearance .
â€œIf the party leadership embraces Donald Trump as the general election nominee than I think it will damage our party for a generation.â€ � Donald Trump may have just coined a new word : â€œEffectuate.â€ �
The importance of defeating Hillary Clinton , the likely Democratic presidential nominee , is paramount , Trump tells the audience in Indiana , â€œso we can really effectuate all of the things and get our country really going again.â€ � UPDATE :
We stand humbled .
â€œI would never use the word â€˜bribe.â€ ™
Some people would say bribes the delegates - I would never say a thing like that ,
â€ �
Trump says of opponent Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s relationship with potential convention delegates .
Still , thereâ€ ™ s a risk that in the second and third ballots , delegates who have been â€œbribedâ€ � into supporting Cruz .
â€œWhy ?
Because they like to have good meals - which Iâ€ ™ m not doing.â€
�
But , he cautions the audience , â€œIt
doesnâ€ ™ t mean anything if we win on the first.â€ �
â€œNobody respects women more than Donald Trump ,
â€ � says Trump , who two nights ago said that Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s only asset as a candidate is her â€œwomanâ€ ™ s card.â€
�
I will be so much better to women than Hillary Clinton .
So much better .
On health care issues .
And on the protection of our country ... we are in an evil world right now ... and Iâ€ ™ m going to protect our country .
Trump has been boasting about how as president he would return manufacturing to the United States : Weâ€ ™ re gon na have a time , if I win , where Apple is going to make its product in the United States .
Is that a threat , or a promise ?
Trump has repeatedly called for taxes on companies , such as once - Indiana - local Carrier , that move their manufacturing centers overseas .
Trump says he did not want to take too much time off after his quintuple victories of this Tuesday because he knew â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � was at work in Indiana : I didnâ€ ™ t want to take too much time because I know youâ€ ™ ve got him back here lyinâ€
™ like hell , so I said better get back here .
Gosh they hate him , donâ€ ™ t
they ?
Representative Peter King says the Cruz - Lucifer comparison drawn Wednesday by former House speaker John Boehner is an insult â€ “ to Lucifer : The Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs is conducting an informal online poll about whether the Labour Party or the Grand Old Party is nearer to absolute collapse .
You have to vote to find out what the crowd thinks .
We will remark only that itâ€ ™ s not even close : Dangerous , foolish , irrational , scary , terrifying , irresponsible , a clown , a disaster .
These are just some of the words used to describe the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency by politicians , diplomats and analysts around the world , write the Guardianâ€ ™ s David Smith and Julian
Borger : As the businessman gave his first major policy address since becoming frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday , Guardian correspondents in Washington and around the globe asked the international community whether it was prepared for the swaggering billionaire to occupy the White House .
Many said they still can not believe the nation that elected its first black president just eight years ago will now rush to embrace a man who has offended Mexicans , Muslims and others .
The possibility that Trump might actually win fills great swaths of the planet with dread â€ “ with the apparent and notable exception of Vladimir Putinâ€ ™ s Russia â€ “ with concerns over everything from trade to the nuclear trigger .
While Trump was delivering his speech in Washington , outlining a doctrine of naked self - interest that would â€œshake the rust off Americaâ€ ™ s foreign policyâ€ � , the heads of all the major UN agencies gathered in Vienna , Austria , for a strategy session with secretary general Ban Ki - moon , now in his last eight months in office .

The story behind the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s California operation sheds new light on the internal power struggle that has rocked the campaign in recent weeks , writes Guardian west coast bureau chief Paul Lewis :
Tim Clark was asked if he was interested in running Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign in California earlier this month .
â€œInterested?â€ � he recalls telling an emissary for the Republican frontrunner .
â€œYou bet Iâ€ ™ m interested .
Iâ€ ™ m about to fall out of my chair.â€
�
Clark could have been forgiven for assuming the job of Trumpâ€ ™ s state director in California â€ “ the most delegate - rich primary contest , and the one likely to determine the outcome of the 2016 Republican race â€ “ would involve being thrust into the billionaireâ€ ™ s inner circle .
Yet more than two weeks into the role , Clark has still not met with Trump or even spoken with him on the phone .
â€œI
havenâ€
™ t talked to him , â€ � he conceded , when pressed over the extent of his communications with Trump .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s been , you know , email traffic and things like that.â€
�
The fact Trump has yet to talk to the strategist in command of the all - important California primary contest may say more about the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s centralized presidential campaign than it does about Clark .
On the other hand , it turns out Clark was not an uncontroversial pick .
Stuart Jolly , who until recently was Trumpâ€ ™ s national field director , said he considered Clark for the role but decided he was not qualified enough .
â€œI had already ruled him out , â€ �
he said .

Teddy Schleifer captures Cruzâ€ ™ s lengthier response to Boehnerâ€ ™ s
â€œLuciferâ€ � insult : Earlier this week , the Ted Cruz and John Kasich campaigns released simultaneous statements describing coordinated efforts in the upcoming states of Indiana , Oregon and New Mexico .
The deal was , supposedly , that Kasich would stay away from Indiana while Cruz stayed away from the other two , allowing a sole candidate to go head - to - head with Trump .
Neither candidate publicly made a statement about the alliance , which some Indiana voters have been reported as finding too cute by half .
But Kasich undercut the supposed alliance a bit by saying that if people in Indiana want to vote for him , they should .
And now Cruz flatly denies there was ever an alliance , reports CNN : At which Kasichâ€ ™ s chief strategist uses the L word : For what itâ€ ™ s worth , Kasich is campaigning today in Oregon , which will divide its 28 delegates proportionally on 17 May , while Cruz has a whole week of Indiana events planned .
Barack Obama has accused the Republican presidential candidates of defying logic and peddling â€œfantasyâ€ � in telling voters they can cut taxes and government regulations , balance the budget and produce economic growth .
â€œIf you look at the platforms , the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president , they donâ€
™ t simply defy logic and any known economic theories , they are fantasy , â€ � Obama said , in an extensive and at times surprisingly frank reflection on his economic legacy in an interview with the New York Timesâ€ ™ s Andrew Ross Sorkin .
The president admits some economic missteps in the interview , including a failure to initiate a significant infrastructure spending project and to sufficiently boost wages .
While the economy has grown during the Obama presidency and unemployment has been cut in half , a near - record number of Americans have dropped out of the workforce and real median incomes have fallen , while wealth and income inequality have grown .
In other words , the economy is working for some but not working for others .
Obama admits as much in the interview : I can probably tick off three or four common - sense things we could have done
where weâ€ ™ d be growing a percentage or two faster each year ...
We could have brought down the unemployment rate lower , faster .
We could have been lifting wages even faster than we did .
And those things keep me up at night sometimes .
The presidentâ€ ™ s main contention , however â€ “ made with an insistence that he feels no personal frustration about the matter â€ “ is that the political discourse has left the public with an inaccurately dim view of his stewardship of the economy , which when he took office was suffering from the housing meltdown , growing unemployment , a credit crisis inside the countryâ€ ™ s biggest banks and the looming potential failure of giant insurance companies .
Culprits for the erosion of this discourse , in the presidentâ€ ™ s view , include the Republican party , which has incessantly repeated that the economic recovery since 2008 has been too slow , while stubbornly refusing to take part in any plan out of the White House to speed the recovery , especially any plan that includes tax hikes .
Blame is shared by the current crop of Republican presidential candidates , in the view of the president , who dismissed the GOP campaign - trail economic platforms as implausible .
â€œSlashing taxes particularly for those at the very top , dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 % or 7 % growth , and claiming that theyâ€ ™ ll do all this while balancing the budget , â€ � Obama said .
â€œNobody would even , with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics , think that any of those things are plausible.â€ �
He continued : If we canâ€ ™ t puncture some of the mythology around austerity , politics or tax cuts or the mythology thatâ€ ™ s been built up around the Reagan revolution , where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts , as opposed to a shift in interest - rate policy â€ ” if we canâ€ ™ t describe that effectively , then weâ€ ™ re doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes .
Obama counts among his regrets a failure to set up a big infrastructure spending project , he told Sorkin : The fact of the matter is , is that our failure in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , to initiate a massive infrastructure project
â€
”
it was the perfect time to do it ; low interest rates , construction industry is still on its heels , massive need
â€
” the fact that we failed to do that , for example , cost us time ...
It meant that there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery .
The president does not suffer from an unfairly grim assessment of his own performance , however .
â€œI actually compare our economic performance to how , historically , countries that have wrenching financial crises perform , â€ � Obama said .
â€œBy that measure , we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history.â€ �
Read the full New York Times interview here .
Cruz - Fiorina is addressing reporters before their Fort Wayne event .
Cruz has welcomed John Boehnerâ€ ™ s calling him Lucifer , tweeting , â€œtell me again who will stand up to Washington?â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s
Twitter has been retweeting people celebrating the Boehner dig as an endorsement : And current speaker Paul Ryan stays far away from the Lucifer talk : Ted Cruz is scheduled to pop up for a campaign rally in Fort Wayne , Indiana , any time now .
Surveil this live video stream if youâ€ ™ d like to see the man John Boehner calls â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � in action Texas senator Ted Cruz has scored what is indisputably the strongest non - endorsement of the 2016 cycle .
Former House speaker John Boehner told a Stanford University crowd on Wednesday evening that Cruz is â€œLucifer in the fleshâ€ � .
Boehner continued , according to a Stanford Daily report : I have Democrat friends and Republican friends .
I get along with almost everyone , but I have never worked with a more miserable son - of - a - bitch in my life .
Lucifer !
Miserable son - of - a - bitch !
Not to put too fine a point on it .
In fact Boehner has called Cruz â€œLuciferâ€ � before , and for good measure deemed the senator a â€œjackassâ€ � for his role in the government shutdown of 2013 .
Cruz held what must have been frustrating sway , for Boehner , over the Tea Party wing of the House as Boehner tried to cobble together various coalitions to keep the government funded and avoid crashing the debt ceiling and pass a border security bill , among other efforts .
As for Cruz nemesis Donald Trump , Boehner said they had played golf together for years and that they are â€œtexting buddies.â€
�
Cruz has not issued a reply to the former Ohio congressmanâ€ ™ s assessment .
He might say that Boehner , who spent 30 years in Congress and was known for having a comfortable relationship with lobbyists , represents everything that is wrong with the Republican establishment .
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Texas senator Ted Cruz created some electricity on Wednesday evening with his announcement that , should he win the Republican presidential nomination , the bumper stickers would read Cruz - Fiorina , as in Carly , the former tech executive ( and presidential candidate ) .
Fiorina made a punchy appearance with Cruz in Indianapolis culminating in a lullaby she sang to Cruzâ€ ™ s kids : The challenge for Cruz - Fiorina is to inspire Republican primary voters in Indiana , which will award 30 delegates to its statewide winner this coming Tuesday in a contest billed as a last stand for the # NeverTrump movement .
Fiorina was up early on Thursday to argue that Donald Trump , who is leading in the ( scant ) polls in the Hoosier state , is just the same as Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton : I put them in the same category because they are the same category .
Theyâ€ ™ re two sides of the same coin ...
I do think for some of us , principles matter , and convictions matter , and policies and principles matter .
It has been reported that Fiorina , early in the primary process , was uniquely capable of getting under the skin of Trump , who was advised to ignore her but mostly could not .
Heâ€ ™ s on Twitter this morning not ignoring her
, in fact : Trump holds events in Evansville , Indiana , and Costa Mesa , California , today , while John Kasich is in Portland and Medford , Oregon , and Bernie Sanders is in Springfield , Oregon .
Did you catch Trumpâ€ ™ s big foreign policy speech on Wednesday ?
Did you have the nagging sense that it didnâ€ ™ t make sense and may in fact have been packed with internal contradictions abetted by an absence of any real detail ?
You werenâ€ ™ t imagining things , writes Dan Roberts : And hereâ€ ™ s a curveball story : a top Cruz campaign operative in Virginia has visited Syria and turns out to be a Bashar Assad apologist : Thanks for joining us today , and as always , visit us in the comments !"
2016-05-07,"Watching Barack Obama and former House Speaker John Boehner swap stories and advice earlier this month for the next chapters in their lives , I was inspired to offer my own bipartisan overture to fellow Texan Ted Cruz as he ends his campaign for the presidency , returning to the slow retired country club of mostly old white men we call the US Senate .
After all , I feel his pain â€ “ losing a big race that was closely watched around the country .
I wonâ€ ™ t go so far as to say that Ted and I have parallel paths .
But we are both Texans ; we both stood up for values that matter to us using lengthy filibusters ( mine to make sure women received healthcare ; his to make sure millions didnâ€ ™ t ) ; we both took to the campaign trail and fought with vigor for the opportunity to serve .
And we both lost to guys who ran on an anti - immigrant platform .
While there are plenty of differences ( too many for a single column ) , I am more than happy to share a few nuggets of wisdom I learned post - election with the Gentleman from Texas to help him readjust to life off - the - trail .
Consider a hobby , but choose carefully Not cards .
Maybe youâ€ ™ ll be invited to play cards with some of the boys .
But I would caution you that now is not the right time .
Donald Trump â€œplayed the woman cardâ€ � before you , and it isnâ€ ™ t turning out so well for him .
And heâ€ ™ s already doing better than you are .
Not travel ( at least not to New York City ) .
You may be tempted to get away with Heidi and the kids to see a Broadway show ( I hear Hamilton is amazing ) .
But given that â€œNew York valuesâ€ � comment you made , you may not be welcome there .
Not reading the same old thing .
You can really only read Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor once before it becomes clichÃ © .
Iâ€ ™ ve got a well - worn copy of The Feminine Mystique I can lend you .
Maybe Twitter ?
I know it helped to propel Mr Trump to his ultimate victory in the Republican primary .
Rest assured â€ “ youâ€ ™ ll find kindred spirits online ( we call yours â€œtrollsâ€ � , but that is neither here nor there ) .
In fact , Iâ€ ™ ve made incredible friends on Twitter ; @FullFrontalSamB and I were talking about you there just the other day actually !
And Iâ€ ™ ve had insightful and amusing conversations with amazing change - makers like Ellen Page , Kerry Washington , Cecile Richards and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand .
I am sure that @AnnCoulter canâ€ ™ t wait to dive deep into a high - minded and compelling Twitter discourse with you .
Enjoy time with your friends Following my loss , I found solace and comfort with my daughters and friends .
I know Heidi and the kids
canâ€
™ t wait to have you home .
Donâ€ ™ t fret
â€ “ Heidi will get over that elbow to her face after your campaign suspension speech the other night .
Plus , now you can call up Carly â€ “ unless her friendship only lasts as long as her tenure as VP candidate , in which case you may be getting sent to her voicemail about as fast as youâ€ ™ ll be sent to Paul Ryanâ€ ™ s .
Speaking of which , Iâ€ ™ m sure your Senate colleagues will be thrilled to see you .
Lindsay Graham said as much : â€œIf you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate , and the trial was in the Senate , nobody would convict you.â€
�
Oh , wait .
Surely he just meant , â€œIf Ted Cruz killed it on the floor of the Senateâ€ ¦ â€
�
Get back to work Your work friends are the perfect segue into my last bit of advice : embrace your job and work hard upon your return .
I am sure that , like me , you embrace the calling to public service .
While I had to resign from the Texas State Senate to run for governor , you didnâ€ ™ t have to leave the US Senate to run for president .
Thatâ€ ™ s great !
It means you can jump right back into the critical work of legislating .
With all the work that the Senate is doing right now â€ “ meeting with appointees to the US supreme court and holding hearings to confirm a new Secretary of the Army , passing budgets â€ “ wait , none of that is getting done .
Well , you will fit right back in nonetheless given your penchant for shutting down the government when you donâ€ ™ t get your way .
Perhaps 2017 will be better ; think of how busy youâ€ ™ ll be battling all those gender equity initiatives that Hillary Clinton will launch as president , advancing the revolutionary ideas of equal pay , reproductive autonomy and family leave policies !
As for me , Iâ€ ™ ve been hard at work since my own run to build Deeds
Not Words , a community of millennial women passionate about creating positive change ( hopefully one of them will one day maneuver to take your job ) .
In the meantime , though , think how fortunate youâ€ ™ ll be to tell your grandchildren one day that you had the honor of serving under your nationâ€ ™ s first woman president ."
